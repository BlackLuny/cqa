Through this program, your refund or overpayment may be reduced by FMS and offset to pay any pastdue child support, Federal agency nontax debts, or state income tax obligations."

There is no set rule.|`|ww12lItvaa	I think you mean "reorganization" and not restructured?    Chapter 11 "reorganization" can go either way.     Most end up in Chapter 7 liquidation because they owe more than they own. In other words they are worthless and so is the stock.     With Chap. 11 it can go either way and sometimes the company can survive but the common stock gets wiped out. Sometimes not but that is more rare. Lenders and preferred stock owners get paid first.     But sometimes, like with a couple of the airlines, they file Chap. 11 for protection from lenders foreclosing on them, to keep operating during a temporary cash flow problem. In that case they are cash poor but have assets greater than their debts or have the ability that with changes to produce profits from ongoing operations.     To determine where a particular company will end up you have to look to see if they have more assets than debt. Then it might survive a Chapter 11 reorganization.     If they have more debt than assets it is most likely they are worthless, will go chapter 7,  and the stock gets wiped out.|`|z0zgfsdcaa	Restructuring means massive layoffs and downsizing

But as a yoga instructor, I can tell the difference between a teacher who has had formal training and someone just ambling through the class based on a DVD that she had bought.    Anyway - try yogafit.  You can take Level 1 and become somewhat proficient.  You can start teaching after getting your cert for Level 1.  You don't have to complete the entire 200 hours to become a yoga instructor but if you want to - you'd have so much more knowledge under your belt.  And how do you get clients?

If you're breaking even on the monthly payments, you actually have cashflow, since you can deduct depreciation off your taxes, and the interest is deductible as well.

kw8tu4Aiaa	Don't quit. Get fired instead. You cannot collect unemployment benefits if you quit, but you can if you are fired.    The only reason to quit instead is if you need to have a clean record of your employment with them for future references. It sounds like things with them have already been rocky, so just let them fire you if they want. They know that they may have to pay unemployment on you if they fire you, so they may want you to quit instead by making things unpleasant for you.|`|vNnvpLKBaa	while ur suspended LOOK FOR A JOB!!!  they will most likely fire u, just so they can put it on ur record, dont give them that chance  when u come back, just tell them u r giving them their 2 weeks notice...say it before they terminate u|`|yCjJJIStaa	I agree with the previous poster who said that it is probably better to get fired, because quitting is likely to harm your chances of getting unemployment.  (Quitting doesn't ALWAYS prevent you from getting unemployment, but it makes it a lot harder.)    The only advantage to quitting is that then you don't have to say you got fired when applying for future jobs, so if this is more of a concern than unemployment, maybe quitting is best.  However, potential employers may find out the circumstances if they call for a reference.  Some HR departments won't say more than the bare minimum, but some will.    One thing to keep in mind is that companies often have legal concerns when they are getting ready to fire someone - even though the firing is rarely illegal, disgruntled ex-employees sometimes sue on frivolous grounds just because they're mad.  I'm NOT saying you should do that, but you may have some leverage to negotiate a neutral reference.  If you've been a good employee for the most part, maybe you could ask a supervisor to write a reference letter for you.    Another thing to consider is that, depending on the state, you may have a right to a copy of your personnel file.  It's a handy thing to have if they contest your unemployment, or if there are positive reviews in there you'd like to have.      If you do ask for a reference or a copy of your file, do it as nicely as possible - that way they won't get defensive and will want to work with you.  Most managers hate the confrontation involved with firing people almost as much as the employee.    Also, be careful of any papers they want you to sign - you don't want to sign away your rights or admit to misconduct.    Good luck!    PS - Not all rule-breaking is serious enough to be "misconduct" that would prevent you from getting unemployment.  Here's a link to the employment department's discussion of this topic:     http://www.edd.ca.gov/UIBDG/Misconduct_M...    Don't assume you're ineligible - go ahead and apply.  They'll probably interview you to determine how serious and willful your problem was.  Even if they deny you at first, lots of people win on appeal.  It's a crappy economy right now so don't rule against yourself from the outset.
h1m17rStaa	Kiyosaki is generally dealing with commercial properties.  Any property with less than 4 units is generally considered  "residential" for lending purposes.  Anything more is commercial.    No normal residential loan allows the loan to be called due (or that you are required to pay down the loan to an acceptable loan to value ratio).  No FHA, VA, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac product for sure, so most normal loans.      I think it's somewhat standard in commercial loans to have a feature like this, however.|`|AA10074148	There must be a reason for the mortgage being called that is why there is a contract. The lender just can not get a wild hair up the rear and decide to call the mortgage.    If this was the case the borrower would not have any protection what so ever.    There might be a clause in your contract where the lender can call the loan once the loan amount is more than the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the property, but I sort of doubt it, because I have known several properties that have gone negative and the lender keep getting the monthly payments.    I sort of think it works in the banks favor if they have a borrower living in a property that has gone negative, but is still making his monthly mortgage payments.

Not many lenders do this, but keep in mind in the mortgage industry crazy things happen.

In the event your mortgage does have a demand feature, you should do some further reading in your note.

Writing a check without money to cover it is a crime.  The bank offer checking and it is expected that you will used your account wisely.  Failure to do so endangers the bank's ability to have its drafts accepted by other institutions.  You clearly were a repeat offender and the bank pulled the plug.  You will have to find a new bank and start over doing things right.    Under your complaint is the desperation of living hand to mouth.  If you are unable to keep money in your account, if you do not have savings, you are living over your income.  I know this is not enjoyable to hear but you need to live on what you make with money left over so an interruption of you cash flow does not become a crisis for you.  I have had situations where I have had to transfer thousands of dollars from savings to checking to cover expenses when there was an issue about a deposit that was going to take several days to straighten out.  I was so thankful for savings that allowed it to be a minor issue rather than a crisis.  Everyone should save - even if only 25 dollars ever 20 weeks - in two years you;d have 1300 dollars saved.  If you can't save 25 dollars, you are spending too much, even if it seems you are very frugal.    Please consider that it was your actions and your financial behavior that has put you in this situation not the banks actions.

Forgiveness of debt is taxed as income and you need to report it on your tax return.    For those above, what likely happened was the taxpayer got himself in debt, allowed the car to be repo'd in 2004 for partial settlement (a repo is not debt forgiveness, by the way), could not pay the remainder of the debt so his creditor wrote off the debt as bad debt expense and issued a 1099-C for forgiveness of debt, which is taxable to the taxpayer as income.

The best approach in my opinion is to write a letter and then phone to make an appointment. Making an appointment assures the manager that his/her time is not wasted and neither is yours. You may get in to see the manager in a cold call situation but may find yourself cooling your heels waiting and a busy manager when you are able to present your service.    When phoning always ask for a minimal time for an appointment. If the manager likes you and your service you will get more time.|`|6f7cc7f9a462eecef46a6a883e70881aaa	I like the idea of doing both.  I am in a "sales" business.  We send out letters, outlining what we can do, and at the end state, "I will be calling you in a few days to make an appointment with you."  That way, it is not a total surprise and imposition.  We then, call the business in a few days, and ask for the manager or the person in charge of legal issues (our business)...for you, ask for the person in charge of hiring for the building.  Quickly as for 10 minutes of the persons time to talk in person...and Good luck!|`|AA10724752	I too have a small cleaning service as well as the fact that I have been in sales and sales management for over 23 years. Here is my take on this.    Cold Calling Is A Waste Of Time. To understand this, cold calling to try to get to speak with the office manager, a person you no nothing about, is a dead end. Calling to get "information" with the gate keeper is much better. You want to know who you need to contact, what is their position, and what does that company do.     You need to ask the gate keeper questions to learn all you can about their business without giving her or him too much information. All they need to know is you want to send some business information to the office manager.    When you get this information, write a very pointed letter to the person explaining why they need your service. Do not go into great detail of how you work rather tell them they need you because you know they are tired of all the dust and uncleaned areas (pointing out some) and you can reslove this situation.    One very important thing you need to state is that you will call on a certain date and time to discuss further. Be sure to include your contact info too, (I'm sure you know this).    Then call when you say you will. Always, I mean always ask for the order (AAFTO).    Hope this helps. Check out this blog and you may find some help their too.

h1m17rStaa	Two questions:  Do you really think you'll enjoy spending all your time trying to sell performance gels?    And, after you don't like doing that, will you want to recruit lots of other people to pay $285 to do the same thing?    Ultimately, MLM's only work if you recruit like crazy.  Most of the money you'd make would be on the recruiting fees from others.      Unless you're a personal trainer or somehow have access to lots of potential customers, it'd be hard to find people to buy it all the time.  So your only other way to make money is to bring others in that can sell instead, or recruit more people under them.    I know nothing of the quality of their products, I'm sure they're just dandy.  But there's also plenty of others like it already on the shelves of every major sporting goods/recreational stores.      Not many people need performance gels.  Ever.  I used a couple on a very long XC ski race.  It tasted like crap, and the packaging is a problem, since they aren't very biodegradable, but it was too messy to put back in a pocket.  If they came up with a solution to that, you'd really have something unique.  I know that's an issue with these products.    But I can't imagine most people needing something like that.  I'd rather get a protein shake with some fruit in it at my heath club than eat some bizarre gel.  The gel made sense for me to use when I raced, because it was so cold that other liquids would freeze and Clif bars were too hard to eat, and I could pack a couple with me easily.  But if I weren't out in the middle of the wilderness with few other options, I wouldn't use them again.    If you've never used a performance gel, you should probably steer clear.|`|072d0d23ab5a69cd206f277e38f40fcbaa	Hi,the only thing that makes their products unique is the gimmicky packaging.Health and wellness is a good market since every one wants to be healthy.Check out this site www.dna911.info,the company is financially solid and has truly unique nutritonal products that people will buy.Their pay plan is excellent and you don't need to be a genius to figure it out.|`|I9g6Musiaa	Do you think you can get others to pay $285 for the same thing?

There's probably nothing wrong with Quicken, but I personally wouldn't want to buy my first home and never be able to meet my banker face to face.  Also, Quicken might not have as big of a product mix as some other brokers, so they may not have the best program for your needs and qualifications.

It's possible some states are different, but I know with certainty that in my state, Minnesota, whoever closed that loan is in serious trouble.  Here, the spouse would have to sign the mortgage, and most importantly, the rescission documents.  Your nephew wasn't given his legal right to cancel the loan within 3 days.  The title company that closed that loan has the responsibility to ensure the owner's rights are protected.

h1m17rStaa	Money laundering is a method of taking illegally earned money, and somehow turning it into legitimate cash.    This can be done in a number of ways, often by purchasing a business that deals with a lot of cash.  You keep pumping the illegal cash through the business, where it's impossible (or at least difficult) to trace where exactly those dollars came from, or what was bought with that money.    Banks can sometimes be complicit, whereby you give them the money, and they give you a loan you never pay back.  Borrowed money is not taxable directly.      There's probably a hundred variations of how to do this, these are a couple very general ways I've heard it can be done.  Probably from some movie I watched.|`|NqiPQtsNaa	its when KATY launders alot of money cheaaaa|`|OkaSzznQaa	I believe you mean "money laundering" This happens when someone makes money from an illegal act filters it through a legit business to hide any trail of the illegal act|`|SqMgRoUOaa	It is illegally earned money put in use or invested in something legal.

b3299c31748a306630be6657d72ee9baaa	Most Option Arm's I've seen have pre-payment penalties attached to it.  Most are usually if you pay more than 5% of the loan at any one time.    You have four option.    1. Minimum - $1500    2. Interest only - This amount is greater than $1500    3. 30 Year amoritization - this amount is even more than option 1 & 2    4. 15 year amoritization - this amount is even more than option 1,2,3.    So if you're paying $2,000 does this amount = or exceed Option 2?  If not then your $500 is going to pay for the interest.    To have your payment go towards prinicipal you'll need to make a payment that's equal or greater than option 3 and 4.    Good luck, I hope you're now educated on Option Arm.    I have to agree with the other posters, most mortgage brokers do a bad job in putting people into option arms.  The reasons why is because they make a crap loan of money on option arms and they sell the "BS" to consumers that with an option arm they can chose to be flexible and if they are short on money for 1 month they can pay less.    If people can't be disciplined enough to pay their mortgage they shouldn't get one.      El|`|h1m17rStaa	Your $1500 payment is not covering all the interest being charged right now.  So you're probably adding a few hundred dollars to your balance every month.    You'd have to pay the IO payment PLUS $500 to get $500 towards your principal.    Apparently, 84% of option ARMs have a pre-payment penalty.  In most cases, you can pay as much as 20% of the principal off in a year with no penalty, so paying small amounts is certainly ok.  But do check your closing documents, specifically the NOTE and any RIDER to the note that talks about prepayment penalties.  If you're confused when reading them, call your bank, loan officer, or the title company you closed at.  Someone should be able to assist you.    And once again, it sounds like you were sold an option ARM with zero understanding of how your loan actually works.  This is why I don't like the product, and don't like most of the people who sell them.  Makes me look bad.|`|4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	Look at your documents.  Some loans have pre-payment penalties. Generally any money over your payment goes directly to principal.  Extra principal payments can dramatically reduce the term of your loan.    You can see the results from various situations as http://www.mortgage-net.com|`|p8RoEI0daa	You're fine, knock yourself out. Even if there IS a pre-pay, it only kicks in according to the terms of the note, generally a greater than 20% payment on principal in the first 1, 2, or 3 years of the loan. Option ARMS vary widely in their characteristics, pull out your note and security insturments, there should be info either in the body of those documents or in the attached riders about pre pay. But I am certain you can make modest additional principal payments without penalty, I look at these types of documents all day long.     As long as your payments are current, the overage will go directly to principal.|`|16940a2ea2da1e9be88644a73bf0aee8aa	with option arm loan- extra money you include with your minimal payment if it is less then interest only payment-  they go to cover interest, and if this payment is higher then interest only option- then difrence is  going towards your principal. if you pay more money then your minimum payment, but less then interest only payment it will reduce the negative amortization on your loan , so you can control how much you aquire every month. in most cases you can not pay off more then 20% of your mortgage ballance in 1-3 years depens of your loan terms and lender.

Which it's unlikely you have, or you'd have been paying your bills on time.    Your credit score is horrendous.  I mean, 75-90% likelihood of default bad.  Why would you want to strap yourself into a mortgage payment until you're back in better financial condition?  You should really reconsider your motivations here.  Get your credit fixed, go 12 full months without missing a single payment on anything, then see about buying a home.  Otherwise, you'll just get stuck in bad, risky, high-rate loans that will ultimately cause you to fail again, and no one wants that.|`|HdTMIZ78aa	this might be a place to look http://www.wesayes.com|`|6546665755ed14d9ee3307f3abeb1c35aa	What "Yahoo sucks" says is dead on.

You can take this person off the title very easy, simply call a title company, tell them you have someone on the title that want to come off.

h1m17rStaa	Usually that means they got some cash from the state, and part of the conditions of that was to rent only to people meeting certain income limits.  They want low-income people.      All you can do is call and see.  But until you have a new job, they can't rent to you either, because you have no income to pay the rent.  I believe it's possible to get into those, take a higher paying job, and at least stay the year for cheap rent, but they wouldn't renew your lease if you were over their limit the following year.    Every state and city would have their own income limits, as they're usually based on the median incomes for that particular area.  What's low income in San Francisco could be high income in Sacramento, for example.|`|4b4ae51e22f7a1ccbb2ef6e5f920f5e7aa	Income restrictions are for low income housing.  So on an apartment they may have a income restriction of 24,000 for a single person meaning that if you make anything over 24,000 you would not qualify to live there.   However not having a job can also hurt you as most of these place can not rent to someone unless they have a verifiable income.    The last thing that you ever want to do is get into low income housing, then get a great paying job and not report it.  Whenever you live in a low income complex and get any type of assistance you need to report any income changes as soon as they happen.  If you don't you can be held responsible for any back rent........let's say you get low income housing and your income at the time is 2000.00 a year, and your portion of the rent is $50.00...market rent on that apartment may be 450.00, so that means the government is paying the other 400.00....so now you get a job and make 23000.00 a year and your rent should be 350.00 and you don't inform your complex of your income raise and it's found out about 6 months later...the complex can then charge you for that 1800.00 (300.00X6), so whatever you do, don't try and live in low income housing and play the system, cause if it catches up to you, and it normally does, you will be in trouble.|`|8fed9008b158687344f0fa29b75538c1aa	It means the complex just wants to make sure that you can afford the apartment without barely scraping by to make the monthly rent payments.  The standard formula is that your monthly rent payment should not exceed more than 30% of your monthly income. So for example, if you were looking at an apartment that rents for $600 per month, and your average monthly income is $2000    You would take the monthly rent and divide it by your monthly gross income    600/2000=0.3    You would income qualify because it doesn't exceed 30% of your monthly income.  If you made any less than that, you would not qualify, and would then have the option of obtaining a qualifying co-signer.  You will have to provide proof that you do make what you say you do, by either providing checks stubs or a statement from your bank saying that you do in fact have (x) amount of dollars in your account.  Hope this helps!
W2m6EKdmaa	As mentioned there are lots of programs for people with bad credit. The real question is "How Bad"? Many lenders will  offer 100% financing down to a 580 mid score. FHA may go lower however I think that most of the mortgage insurance companies now require a 575. If you have any down payment 5% to 10% you can go even lower.  It also depends on income, length of job history, reserve money etc....    Good Luck  Talking with a broker or bank can help. Most banks deal with good credit so a broker is probable better in this situation|`|2515b10e68e4089d58d117a2c1917daeaa	I don't know where you are located but there are alot of first time buyer programs out there.

I had a friend buy through this program and back then (5 years) she had to only put down closing costs of $1500.00. as far as the bad credit?  Keep working on cleaning it up to start with. Try to find either a debt counsellor who can get the payments and amounts dropped sometimes at least half. I talked to one the other day and they said if I could come up with $100/mo they could work out settlements with the credit companies.   Get your free yearly credit report.  If you want your score you will have to pay for it. Good Luck|`|h1m17rStaa	search for housing finance agency in your state.

Failure to do so in and of itself is not a crime, but attempting to cash it is a pretty serious offense.    I suppose you could play dumb, but being that you already know it is fake, this tactic could severely backfire.    I would turn it in to the police, play it safe before you have to fight the law with thousands of dollars in attorney fees and fines, or spend time in jail or prison, all over some amount I am almost certain will seem small in comparison.|`|BxqLCCRfaa	I would not cash it.

0VkUe01saa	No. Not in regards to social security. You are fine on capital gains too.|`|h1m17rStaa	All gains up to $250,000 are tax-free, $500,000 for a married couple.  Make sure you accurately account for your tax basis on the home, this will not be a good year to attempt to do your taxes without professional assistance.      I'm not aware that having cash in the bank limits your social security.  Income from those investments could cause some of your benefits to become taxable, if over a certain threshold though.  Once again, now is an ideal time to consult a tax professional for real in-depth advice.
h1m17rStaa	You have something you want to sell.  You give the item to a store.  They sell it.  They take a cut and you get the rest.    you're paying them for having a way to bring buyers to your item.|`|VauJq316aa	If you are the owner of the goods, then you, the "consignor" enter in an agreement with another person or business (the "consignee" / dealer) to carry in stock and sell the goods on your behalf.  The dealer ie. consignee, pays you only when the item sells.  You agree that the dealer keeps a certain dollar or percentage amount of what the goods sell for.  Careful though, the dealer has no "obligation" to "push" and sell the item for you, and the dealer has the right to return the goods to you if they do not move (sell).|`|jSo7Hy7Haa	That is where people give you the product on consignment (they sign it over to you to sell for them) and when you sell it you get paid a fee).  It is good to have insurance when you do this in case of loss or theft.
5KSdtlmdaa	La migliore cosa sarebbe affidarsi ad un avvocato.   Credo comunque che sarebbe opportuno fissare subito una visita da un medico legale per poi  presentarsi alla causa avendo qualcosa di concreto in mano. Per concreto intendo una perizia medico-legale di parte che attesti ufficialmente le invalidit di tuo padre. Questo atto potr essere utile a tuo padre anche il giorno in cui dovr sottoporsi  alla visita innanzi al medico che ricever la nomina per formulare un parere sulla sua condizione.  Se proprio non avete la possibilit di rivolgervi ad un avvocato provate a chiedere aiuto presso qualche associazione o sindacato. Per quanto riguarda il medico legale non c' via d'uscita, qualora decidiate per la visita, dovete pagare subito e anticipatamente.   Vi consiglio comunque di non esitare a spendere qualcosa ora. Vedrete che, se la condizione d'invalidit  reale, il sacrificio di questa spesa dar presto i suoi buoni frutti.      Saluti e buona fortuna.

TpJFuD3raa	I have a S corporation, and because of this I don't have to pay the self employment tax that a sole proprietorship has to pay.  As a corporation, there is less risk of audit compared to a sole proprietorship.  I don't think that an LLC can avoid self employment tax, unless you file a form 8832 and elect to have your LLC taxed as a corporation.  I am not a CPA, so please verify all of this info.  And I filed  my corporation with http://www.incorporatefast.com for about $400.      But as everyone else mentioned, you get limited liability protection by filing either a LLC or Corporation.      Another benefit, is separating the business from the owners, which will allow your business to grow to an unlimited size.|`|h1m17rStaa	You may or may not have any tax benefits compared to just a sole proprietorship.     1 reason to incorporate:  protection of personal assets.  If someone wants to sue you, they can only collect assets of the corporation.  They can't take your personal money, house, etc...      Your ability to write things off should be identical, really, as you can write off plenty as a sole proprietor too.      Consult a CPA (not just a tax preparer like HRBlock).  They don't just do tax returns.  They help you plan your business to minimize taxes as well.  Making business decisions based on tax implications is done by major corporations all the time.|`|VG4gKiggaa	The ONLY reason to incorporate is to protect your personal assets, but it isn't worth it unless you have a bunch of "attachable" assets. That list varies by state.    There are NO tax benefits to incorporating for the VAST majority of small businesses/self-employed. That is a myth perpetrated by attys who make a mint drawing up simplistic Articles of Incorporation for self-employed types.    Go to a good CPA (not H&R Blockheads) & make sure you are getting all the deductions you can legally take. I betcha you're missing some significant ones. S/he can also advise you on putting money into a SEP, IRA, Roth IRA, etc. Putting some of your profit away for retirement WILL have tax advantages - some now, some later. As an added bonus, you won't have to eat dog food when you get old.    Best wishes!|`|s1JUsiLzaa	YES! The number one incentive is protection of personal assets. Also, tax breaks and better funding (easier to get loans when incorporated)     However, corporations have to abide by strict regulations from the government. Try a partnership if you can...

Il tuo datore di lavoro  sicuramente in gravissimo difetto e potresti rovinarlo quando vuoi rappresentando la tua situazione ad un sindacato o alla Guardia di Finanza ma prima di fare questo passo devi fare chiarezza dentro di te e decidere se vuoi continuare a lavorare o no in questo negozio. E' naturale che qualora tu scelga di procurare fastidi al tuo capo, in brevissimo tempo ti troverai senza quel lavoro. Magari, in questo modo, otterai quanto ti  dovuto o forse no (per stabilirlo bisognerebbe sapere come avviene il pagamento degli stipendi - in contanti, per assegno, per bonifico - e se tu firmi regolarmente le buste paga).   Considera poi che non  possibile essere inquadrati come apprendisti per tutta la vita (ci sono sicuramente dei limiti temporali fissati per et o periodo lavorativo - non so dirti di pi) e una volta raggiunto per te il limite di tempo consentito, il tuo datore di lavoro potrebbe cercare una nuova apprendista e tagliarti fuori. Questo potrebbe consentirgli di continuare a pagare poco i suoi dipendenti.   Pensa bene a queste considerazioni e poi decidi cosa vuoi fare.  Magari puoi provare a cercare un'altra sistemazione e una volta  trovata dare il benservito al tuo sfruttatore.  Saluti e buona fortuna.|`|1rgv4Swgaa	lavora la met!!!!!!!!!   scherzi a parte, sindacati o ispettorato del lavoro e sopratutto cercati qualcos'altro il disonesto ti fa spaccare la schiena e non ti da nemmeno i tuoi soldi!!!!!   se sei una buona commessa in citt gi ti avranno notato, vedrai che troverai molto facilmente.|`|4057d4f30beee0ba953f84aa23080352aa	Non  una gran cosa che la busta paga sia pi alta dello stipendio effettivo.

Per quanto riguarda, invece la tua situazione economica, questa  piuttosto complicata:   1) il fatto di ricevere una busta paga con l'indicazione di una retribuzione inferiore a quella effettivamente percepita, ti crea da una parte un danno economico legato ad un minore versamento contributivo che si tradurr inevitabilmente in una pensione molto bassa;  2) l'altro aspetto a te favorevole  quello di pagare meno irpef e ottenere maggiori vantaggi dal punto di vista dei sevizi sociali di cui eventualmente hai bisogno.  Ci detto, puoi tranquillamente cercare un altro lavoro senza abbandonare quello che attualmente fai. E, nel caso ne trovassi uno che ti si addice, nulla  perduto per quanto non ti  stato dato  ufficialmente nel lavoro precedente.  Ecco cosa devi fare:  1) segnati tutte le ore di lavoro svolto ogni giorno su un calendario;  2) segnati il periodo di ferie che ti viene effettivamente concesso;  3) segnati la retribuzione che ti viene corrisposta in nero e se possibile fattela dare con un assegno, che fotocopierai o con altro pagamento rintracciabile.  Quando per qualsiasi ragione abbandonerai il tuo lavoro, potrai denunciare il datore di lavoro all'Ispettorato del Lavoro, o all'INPS, o all'INAIL della tua citt con una semplice lettera che spedirai corredata di fotocopie a comprova di quanto denunci, o se preferisci, ti potrai rivolgere ad un patronato sindacale per una vertenza di conciliazione.

Your financing must be non-recourse.  Meaning the lender can't come back at you for any losses.  So, they can lend on the collateral only.  Which usually means higher rates, tougher terms, and don't expect to find anyone willing to do anything without a 30-40% downpayment.      You're still taxed on any gains for the financed portion.

h1m17rStaa	Consider yourself lucky you lasted this long.  Contracts for deed do not give you the same protections as a bank mortgage.  In most cases, they can reclaim the property completely within 30 days of non-payment.      Assuming you're behind right now, you're in breach of contract.  Get a lawyer.|`|AA10820306	I'm certainly no lawyer so all I can offer is my dictionary's definition of "breach of contract":    "A breach of a legal?duty; failure to do something that is required in a contract".    Seems reasonable if the contract spells out what constitutes default then that would prevail, but in a lack of that being defined, I suspect you will need a lawyer to advise you.  If you are low income, some county bar associations offer free legal advice.  If you belong to AARP, they used to have a deal where you can contact one of their recommended lawyers and the first 30 min are free.     Sorry I can't be of  more help.
h1m17rStaa	Plan on doing way more work than you ever hoped to.  Expect to get offers that discount the fact that you aren't paying a realtor.  Plan on not getting as much for your home as you could have with an agent. This is just reality.    Do you have any intentions of paying an agent who brings a buyer to your home?  That's 3% right there.  May as well pay another 2-3% and let someone else handle all the crap.      At least go to one of those FSBO companies and get some professional assistance so you don't end up screwing up and getting sued for something you missed.|`|gTFQsIsgaa	Let me begin by stating my bias - I am a Realtor.  That said, I have helped several FSBO's sell their homes.  We do this because A. they have to buy another home and B. they see people who don't buy their home and sometimes provide us with names of the people who are looking.    Beware however. Most real estate-related law suits result from FSBO's not understanding how to sell real estate.  It's more than just marketing.    Nationally, you'll average 13% higher sales prices when you do pay a Realtor.  The reason is that the people who are looking at FSBOs are either 1) investors who do not offer full price 2) people who don't qualify for a loan or 3) people casing your place for a future burglary. ( I don't know how often that happens, but I know of 1 instance personally.)    The best reason to pay a real estate agent is control.  Remember, the agent works for you.  They're going to give your home maximum exposure, ensure it's priced right, advise you on  the best way to present it and keep you out of legal trouble.  Today's society is ready to sue on a moment's notice.  When you have an agent acting on your behalf, you have protection.    Another factor to consider is that when you advertise a FSBO, people know you aren't paying a commission.  They therefore assume you'll drop the price by say, 6% from what you're asking - even if you've already done that.  The second challenge you'll face is in appraisals.  By completing an online course, anyone can become an appraiser.  Like real estate agents, appraisers are so numerous, nearly everyone knows one.  So when Mrs. Jones looks at your property, she lowers the price and has her brother appraise the property 15% lower than it should be.    Finally, the paperwork involved in selling a property is complex.  Not all sellers are prepared to interpret the contract properly.  There are legal requirements and anytime you do more than fill in the blank on pre-approved legal forms (and that means pre-approved for your local area, not nationally), you're practicing law without a license.    Realtors have been around for a long time, and there's more reason today than even 10 years ago.  If we didn't earn our pay, we wouldn't be in business. Think about that.    So if you are going FSBO, do yourself a favor. Offer to establish a relationship with an agent.  Have lookers sign in before showing and if they don't make an offer on your home, supply their names to that agent.  If the agent is reputable, he/she will still offer good advice to help you sell your home.
p5hjGfgoaa	Contact a major mortgage lender such as Countrywide or Wells Fargo who specializes is subprime mortgages. Rates may be slighlty higher, but that is okay as long as you can afford the payment.  This will help you re-establish your credit history so you can refinance into a prime loan at a later date (2-5 years).  As for seller assistance, generally, if you are putting 20% down, you can receive up to 9% of the sale price as a seller assistance. Of course, the seller would have to agree to this. Typically, the sale price increases if a seller assistance is involved.  Also check first time homebuyer loans, FHA loans and other avenues for minimal downpayment loans.

b34f6db57449bce71c637f2103cbd20aaa	Only your parents will be taxed. They will have to file Form 709, which is a gift tax return. $22,000 of the gift is tax free (they may have increased this to $24,000 recently). They will actually not pay tax on this gift thought. This gift tax return is filed to reduce the unified credit that is available to them on their estate tax return. Consult a CPA.|`|h1m17rStaa	They can each give you $12,000 annually, so that's $24K.      I don't know how much the home you're buying is worth, but I'd try to just get $24K now, and use that as your down payment.  Do something like an 80/15, as long as that $24K is at least 5% of your purchase price.  Use a line of credit for the 15%, so it can be paid down whenever you want.    Have your parents put the rest of that money in some laddered CD's.  It's not hard to find a CD paying 5-6% right now.  Every year, they can give you another $24K to put against your balance, and you're at least offsetting the interest you'd be paying on the line of credit with the earnings on that money.  Not 100%, but beats the hell out of gift tax at 45% or whatever it is this year.      It will take a few years, but after 4 years you've gotten $96K.  In year 5, they can give you the remaining $4K plus all the interest accrual on that money.    Meanwhile, there's a good chance that the $100K will eventually be larger than the 15% line of credit you took out.  Assuming that's true, it'd be wise for you to take an interest-only first mortgage.  You can do this even with a 30 year fixed-rate loan, where usually the first 10 years are interest-only.  You can make principal payments like it's a normal 30 year loan, or however you want to pay them.    But, if you put big chunks of principal down on a normal 30 year fixed rate loan, your payment doesn't drop.  It would on an interest-only loan, however, as the payments are recalculated monthly.  Works slick for people with income that comes in big pieces, and would work for you too.    Homeslice is right, in that they wouldn't pay taxes today on that gift.  Whether it would ever be taxable depends on their entire estate when they die.  Consulting a CPA is advised.  If it would eventually be taxable, my strategy as outlined above should work nicely.  Bring it with when you meet the CPA.

If you have a real estate license you must disclose to the seller that you are a licensed real estate agent, after which they become suspicious of you.     You should go to the local book store and purchase several books on real estate investing to include buying and flipping, also anything on foreclosures as well as distressed properties.  You might also find the same books at you library.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"

QsbB6vkoaa	when i needed to raise money this is all the stuff i did.  i asked every one in my family if they could chip in with anything, to go to my fund raising fund (i got more than $100 dollars)  i also told them that since i needed the money i was grateful for any job they had to offer like babysitting, cleaning their house, washing their car, running their errands. and to spread the word to their neighbors or anyone they knew.  i also had a yard sale and they gave me stuff that they didn't need to sell.   put flyer's up where you say you babysit, dog sit, and old-people sit  also make a deal with your parents, in which you agree to give up a few stuff you like to do (like going shopping or to the movies) as long as they promise you a few hundred bucks.  have a fund-raiser party and invite all of your friends and charge $5.00 per person.  also offer to caterer for your parents and their friends.  charge and leave a bowl for tips. and make menus and put on the bottom that if they need a caterer to call you. and if you get hired ask your friends to dress formal and help you by being the waitresses.  organize little kids parties or at least help out, then dj for them.  sell books, videos, DVDs on amazon or ebay.  offer to tutor a neighbors kid. that pays $15.00 an hour.  offer your parents you'll be the house keeper, and charge $10.00 an hour.  have a car wash.  make goodies like cakes and desserts and sell them  ask your school for permission to make a huge student garage sale that benefits everyone who need to raise money.  also ask your school what you can do, to make your balance go lower, like tutoring or helping out a teacher after school, they can even let you help out in the cafeteria.   you can also get paid for answering questionares online but i don't know the actual names. sorry.  and finally make a resume of all the things you can do and give them out.  save all of your change or change you find on a box and don't cash it until it's almost time for your trip.   there's a bunch of stuff you can do, just use your imagination.  and i really hope this helps.  Have fun at your trip!!|`|AA10202389	Don't they get $125 a week to take care of children in your home? Three children would do it or any full time job. I take it you have limited hours.

Zs2lUCI4aa	Are you kidding? most American don't know French or Spanish, if you want to get education overseas, then try Canada. Then you can directly attending test and get license.    Nurse is very HOT, and difficult to get in Nurse in California.All colleges are 4 to 10: 1, so some schools do lottery, some schools do waiting list around 3 to 5 years.    Nurse is very hot, many first year graduates get $80K/ year ,average $120,000 in CA.    But be aware, many hositals will cut nurse salary in next a few year, because so many lost jobs, no job means no insurance, they will not either seeking medical care or without paying bill, who can afford $14,000/year medical insurance for a family of 4.    And so many nurse graduates plus huge Filipino and Indian Nurses get licenses in US, If you don't do it in $25/hr, many are waiting up for the position.    You also need to know nurse is not a flamboyant career, you take care of sick and dying people, you work between all those difficult people( doctor, patient, insurance, pharmacy and lab...)|`|VR0h4L32aa	Hi, you know to me personally it makes no sense to study abroad for Nursing, you need to study here and pass the state's bar test for Nursing.  if you want to visit spain or france, you can do that before your nursing school starts or after it is finished.|`|Irax3whwaa	I am not aware of specific abroad programs, but don't let not knowing the language stop you from going if you find one.

03e7189328d2be0ae2b7ccb88dad8bc6aa	You didn't say if both mortgages are on the same house, i.e., a first and a second but I'll assume that's the case.  If the first defaults and forecloses, it wipes out the second lien.  If the second is in default usually (in a normal housing market and normal economy where there's some equity in the house) the the second mortgage holder will step in (foreclose) and make sure the payments on the first are current while it arranges a sale.  However, if the house is underwater like many are these days, the second might not do anything.  There might be a clause with the first lienholder that allows them to accelerate the loan (call their loan due in full) if a subordinate loan goes into default.  Your friend should check her loan documents, or if she's not confident doing that herself consult a lawyer.

OtyVpS3laa	HOLD UP!!!    First of all, what the person said above is correct...it is an interest free loan, but what the other person said about waiting for the 15k tax credit is NOT CORRECT. There is a huge misconception about this 15k vs. 7500k tax credit. The 15k (which is the maximum, it's actuallu 10% of your home cost) tax credit is  NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. Meaning, unless you and/or your spouse makes enough money to incur 15k in money you owe in taxes each year, the credit will help lower your tax liability to maybe 0. HOWEVER, if you don't owe enough in taxes, than you won't get a REFUND OR CHECK with the remaining money. The 7500 tax credit, is refundable, so in our case, we bought a home and didn't owe taxes so we recieved a check for the whole 7500. Which we have to pay it back, but its intrest free! You would need to purchase a home before this law passes, because it will sunset the current 7500.00 tax credit, meaning going forward it will be the only home tax credit you can choose from, whether it benefits your or not.    Hope this helps a bit!!|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	There are specific loans for first time home buyers (all people on the loan have to be 1st time buyers).  there is no specific tax credit for first time buyers.|`|oTSB5BITaa	The Federal Housing First Time Home Buyer Tax "Credit" is really a no interest loan that must be paid back over 15 years. You receive the credit by claiming it on your Federal income tax return (the line it is on depends on what IRS tax form you use to file your taxes). Married couples making less than 150K and single people who make less than 75K can receive the full $7500 credit, but you must purchase the home between 4/9/08 and 6/30/09 to qualify.    This link may help: http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/|`|PkCTYMbnaa	The other person is not correct there is a first time tax credit if purchased before a certain date. It is more like a loan that starting in 2010 will have to be repaid with in 15 years. It is interest free. My son qualified this year since he purchased a house this past November just keep in mind if you sell the house before the money is paid back the full amount is due the year you sell the house. With the way house prices are dropping might not be worth the gamble|`|cK8TnRHRaa	Wait. There is currently an amendment in the "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009" that modifies that first-time home buyer tax credit. This amendment would bump the credit to $15k and make it so you don't have to pay it back!    You should wait to file and watch this legislation.
3vHGjuBgaa	I use TaxAct as well. My return was accepted on Jan 19th and I received my federal refund DD on Jan 30th. According to this IRS efile chart: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2043.pdf since your return was accepted on Jan 24, you SHOULD have a direct deposit on Feb 6th.    The IRS will update their WMR page on Wed. Hopefully it will show you to have a DD date of Feb 6th since they do deposits on Fridays. Also, one of the reasons the WMR says they have no info for you right now might be because it goes into that default mode when you check the site too many times in one day! Wait 24 hours before checking it again and it will probably have your info, but Wed is when it should be updated!|`|lGg8AU1Yaa	if your in california there being withheld for a month or two. depends on your states money issues, California is the worst, i was supposed to get mine the 5th but not now.|`|L2VAW88xaa	I filed on jan 16, accepted on the 17th....my dd date was feb 3rd then it changed a few days ago to the 24th of feb.

zmqN0M86aa	While you still have to pay back the $7500, it is still free money in that the tax credit is interest free.  My fiance and I qualify for the credit and will be filing for it on our taxes.  We will then put the money on our mortgage.  That's $7500 we do not have to pay interest on.      You're right, if you sell the house, turn it into business or rental property, or are foreclosed on before the 15 years are up, you owe the IRS the rest of the money in one lump sum.  Think and plan wisely before applying for it.|`|b67w0mM2aa	In general I agree with the idea behind this credit. As a first time home buyer myself, it was difficult to scrape up closing costs, a down payment, an apprasal fee, and oh yeah by the way a refrigerator, washer, dryer, etc, not to mention the cost to heat and cool my home is 4 times as much as it cost to heat and cool my one bedroom apartment. The pros for this credit are that it is designed to ease the extreme financial burden that comes with buying your first home. The government wants to give you a loan interest free, but, as you mentioned, if you sell your house, it is due in a lump sum. The credit certainly makes much more financial sense than charging these new home expenses on a credit card or seeking other financing terms. Where else would you find a 15 year interest free loan? If you don't need financial help with your first home expenses I would suggest taking the credit investing the money in a Money Market Account at a bank or buying a certificate of deposit that matures around tax time each year. Since you won't have to pay interest on the loan why not let the loan work for you and earn interest? Certainly, those folks that are not able to make ends meet or budget responsibly will have a higher tax burden at the end of each taxable year and might not have the money. I would consider that to be a con. During normal times I'm sure someone would tell you to invest that money in the stock market but for now I much prefer Money Market Accounts and Certificates of Deposit. Discover Bank has some great savings products with great rates that are available online. If you want to check out what other banks are paying you can check out bankrate.com. Good Luck!
C43YMzSxaa	You see, its basically a pact between the advertiser and the TV channels. The Tv channels get payed for showcasing the advertisements and the advertisers need a platform to advertise, so all the programs that could otherwise be comming take a back seat.And they get more advertisers for the more popular programmes, so you and me are indirectly the cause for the whole scenario.   And yes!! the rest of the world gets equally frustated with the ads too. But think about it, but for the adds you might not get to know of the new products out in the market!!!|`|8ZoSSslFaa	yes
DorePwVOaa	Never make a late payment.  Keep your "debt-to-credit" ratio at less than 30% - that is, if you divide all the balances across all of your credit cards by the total credit lines across all of your cards, the number you get should be less than 0.30. (Example: you have a $500 balance on one credit card, and that card has a limit of $2000, and you have a $1000 balance on a card with a $5000 limit. You divide $500+$1000 by $2000+$5000, and you would get 0.214, which is fine.)  Keep your oldest credit card - the longer your credit history, the better. Only cancel your oldest card if it has excessive fees.  Don't apply for lots of new credit cards or loans - these applications for credit ding your score.|`|X8iNQRnYaa	redit repair workd fine to fix my credit.

Contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate much lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.    They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.    Please note that CCCS cannot perform miracles in situations where there is an overwhelming level of debt relative to your income/assets.|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	Yes. if  it's too good to be true, it usually is.You can call cccs in your state to see what they can do but usually consumers realize that they can not afford to make monthly payment every month for about 3 years or more.|`|ZB0393Kkaa	Yes it is a scam. They thrive on making up lies and steal your money. You have all the power to negotiate settlements with your creditors that an attorney does, so do your own negotiating.     If worst comes to worst, you can file for bankruptcy, which has legitimate lawyers practicing that. You might have also been lead to believe by those scam artists that bankruptcy forces you to repay your debt. This is incorrect as well. If you're below median income or otherwise pass the means test (from the sounds of your situation you would), you can still file for a complete Chapter 7 discharge.     Hope that helped.

4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	You can get a mortgage, it's just more expensive.    I would strongly recommend that you pay off all the old debt with the new money coming in.  After you pay it off, save the money.    The banks are going to do some math about your total payments.  The less going to credit cards, the more you can afford toward a house.  Thus, they will approve you.    By making up all the past due debt and clearing things up, you will improve your FICO score, which will allow you to borrow at the best rate possible.  A quarter or eighth of a percentage point may not seem like very much, but it is tremendous over a 30-year mortgage.    You need to do a lot of reading.. buying a house is generally the largest purchase most people ever make.    If you can manage to save some money, you can reduce or eliminate Mortgage Insurance, which covers the lender in case you go broke for whatever reason. This is even more you pay.    Good luck!|`|AA12070736	As long as your late payments DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT include a late payment on a MORTGAGE, you're more than likely going to pay a higher rate but approval maybe not out of the question.

Even in this case, your approval will come from a subprime mortgage lender. You have to approach a lender who deals exclusively in loans for people with not so perfect credit or in situations that cause difficulties in getting a mortgage.    If your credit score lies between 600  620, you might be easily approved for 100% financing. Even in this case, you have to approach a subprime lender.    For a credit score of at least 620, you can easily avail of 100% financing, along with a reduced rate of only 1 - 2 percentage points more than the prime rate.|`|0cd9f6fd4bd12a30fff0657501837a52aa	I recommend waiting and saving for a downpayment.  However, if you have scores of 580, check out the free evaluation form at    www.totaldebtsolutionsllc.com    They have a network of loan officers and should be able to get you financed.  I guess you could always refinance into a better rate in 6 months after your score improves due to making ontime house payments.  Good luck.|`|h1m17rStaa	You really need to slow down.  Get everything paid down.  Save up for 3-6 months of cash reserves, so you can avoid problems if something goes bad again.  Then save up for a downpayment.  Then buy.    This might take a year or two.  If so, good.  It's just that much longer for your credit scores to improve.    You're on the brink of being financially solvent again, and you seem desperate to throw yourself right back hanging on the edge again.  It's not a good idea.    With your current credit situation, you will pay higher rates, if you can even get a loan with zero down payment.  The more you put down, the better your rate will be.  Sometimes by hundreds of dollars per month.  Why waste that on high interest?      A good loan officer would take some time and help you map out how to get your credit scores up and get you into a good rate loan in 6-12 months time.  Renting can be quite cheap compared to owning a home, there's nothing wrong with that.  Use that to save more money.
f96fc627f519f3ac55a4b380b5d54678aa	Possibly - our ebay sales were down 85% on last Christmas.  However I also firmly beleive that ebay themselves have failed sellers by introducing their new search format in September 2008; our sales started falling dramatically from this point!|`|M7QdxEQ0aa	September and October were horrible for me and December was a little better.

Many of the items sold on eBay are expensive compared to high street retail prices.  Just take a look.  The reason why is eBay have raised fees so sellers have to charge more.

7I46vTrbaa	First off, congrats on your pregnancy.    Please be careful there are so many people out there promoting scams & get rich quick schemes. There are no ways to get rich quick. The offers are all so tempting.    I've wasted time and money on more so called opportunities than I care to admit :) What's worked for me is building my own content websites. Each has multiple streams of income from affiliate programs and adsense.  I also make money working with a drop shipper. I'm not getting rich but I'm making regular money.     Building a website is something that can be done as time permits, which it sounds like you're pretty busy.    I'd recommend starting with a free course that helped me. It's a lot of work to complete but it's worth it. It teaches you everything you need to know about building a website that earns money. Most importantly it will help you figure out if it's something that you'd like to do before you spend any money on the tools you'll need.    You can download the free course at this link:  http://aff-masters.sitesell.com/scamfree...    I've also included a link below where you can see some example sites & videos. Just so you know there's nothing for sale on that page.    All the best to you and your family.|`|gYZd76iIaa	Try craigslist.org... its similiar to ebay but more local & it excludes the shipping.|`|AA10163323	There are a lot of scams out there, as you already know.  There are also some good companies that have been around for years.  Some may be better suited than others depending upon an individuals background, personal interests, and aptitude.    My advice when looking at any 'opportunity' is to ask yourself three questions:    1) What is the most I could lose if this doesn't work?    2) What is the potential income if it does work?    3) If there is a product or service being offered (aside from making money), ask yourself if this is something I would buy from a traditional source, like a shopping mall or the yellow pages.  If you wouldn't buy or use it yourself, you will likely have trouble persuading others that it is worthwhile.    I've tried several, and although other people were making money, I wasn't.  There was no question about being legitimate.  It boiled down to compatibility with my own interests.    One I've settled on just a few months ago was put through the criteria above.  It may not be for you, but here is what I found:    The opportunity I chose is called Mentors Club. http://succeed.mentorsclub.com    1) The most I could lose is $29.97 - it is a membership, or subscription web site offering personal development material in electronic form, mainly audio, video, and e-books from sources I recognized.  I had been paying this much or more at Amazon.com or my local bookstore anyway.  This is a monthly fee but you can cancel at any time.    2) The income potential is unlimited -- in the long run.  In the short run you still have to work at promoting it by getting people to visit the web page.  Do NOT expect overnight wealth.  This is not a get rick quick scheme.      3) Aptitude - I've been interested in personal develoment and the self-help industry for many years, so there was a fit.  Mentors Club goes several steps further, though, and provides mentoring and material on subjects as diverse as playing the guitar, learning Spanish, and martial arts.    What really sold me was their mission to donate money to children's charities.   The three legs of this 'stool' are membership, mission and money.    As I said, this may not be for you, but whatever you look at, put it through the three questions above before making a commitment.    I hope this helps, and good luck to you.  I'd be interested to find out what you do choose.    Stephen Hall, PMP  pm.coach@gmail.com  http://succeed.mentorsclub.com|`|VN2m6XHXaa	Nice comment from shall89. Stephen Hall.  Only $29.97.

Or even scrapbooking supplies? I know of a company called Close to My Heart that has some really awesome scrapbooking stuff. There is also a jewelry company I know of called Lia Sophia (used to be Lady Remington).     All of these are set up the same as far as I know. You take the product to the hostess's house where her friends come to buy the stuff. If they buy, you make money. If they don't buy, no money, but you wont lose money either.  I'm pretty sure that each company has a start up fee to become a consultant, but after that it is pretty much making money. I know a lot of people do this as a full time job.     You can do parties whenever you want. You could decide to only do them on the weekends, or only in the evenings, or both. It's totally up to you.

w59m2anKaa	Credit card companies have 7 months to collect on your debt and believe me they will use it.  Once the end of the 7th month hits they have to write off your debt as a loss.  This goes onto your credit report as a bad debt, which is worse than a bankruptcy.  If it's only 4 months past due you are barely hitting the collection departments WITHIN your credit card company.  Pay off the card before it gets any worse.  The longer it stays past due the worse it is on your credit report and once it's charged off as a bad debt it's horribly damaging to your credit report.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Call the credit card company and ask them their policy about this.|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	call them and  ask them for hardship payments or file bankrupsy  it would be cheaper|`|PqGVcRwZaa	Hi,  I used "Credit Solution" to settle my debt and avoid bankruptcy.They managed to reduce my debt up to 58%.It's legitimate.I came across this company on NBC News Special Edition.Check it out here:  http://CreditSolution.ez-mart.biz
J5aw0ubpaa	I lost my job around 12/18/2007.I have been recieving unemployment since 1/1/08 when I filed online.The first set of benefits were for 26 weeks,then they came out with the 12 extension in July.I qualified because I was still not working.Those benefits expired around 11/1/08,then I recieved nothing for the month of November.In Dec.08 they came out with another extension for 7 weeks.I recieved those 7 weeks and then strangely last week I recieved a letter in the mail stating that I qualified for Tier 2 benefits of the original 12 extension.So now I am recieving 12 weeks which I believe will be my last set of benefits.I filed online intially.With so many extensions out right now it is a good time to file if you are not woking.I average 400 a week,where as when I was working I averaged 600 ,so its not too bad.Plus my husband still works.Im just really glad they have this for people who still need to pay bills and are out of work.|`|Vwvo5iroaa	I was told there was an extra 13 weeks after the initial 6 months, but I also heard there was an emergency 6 months after your first tier of 6 months. So I guess the only way to find out is to wait and find out.
K7x1RHVFaa	She is going to be in trouble and so may you.    It reads like you are paying cash and not filing taxes for her.    You can do this if you pay her less than 500 dollars in a 90 day period, (contract labor). If you paid more than that you should have paid taxes on her and filled out a 1099MISC to generate a 1099 for her.    Of course she is in trouble as she is pretending she does not work at all. Her income should be added to her husband's income and they should pay taxes accordingly.    Unless he is filing married filing separately and not taking her as a deduction, her income has to be counted even if it is less than 8950, her standard deduction + personal exemption.    In short, you are best not deducting this if you are not certain it is legal.    And yes, I am certain of what I have typed here.|`|AA10469473	Legally she is required to claim the income whether you file for the child care credit or not.    If the babysitting was their only joint income, she'd be required to file if it was over $400 for the year.  Since she is filing anyway (a joint return), she is required to report it from the first dollar.
AA10274297	I think you got it exactly right.    You file as head of household, claim 4 exemptions (yourself, son, gf, and her son), and claim EIC for your son.    If there was any tax withheld on your girlfriend's $2000, then she should file as single, no exemptions (because she and her son are claimed by you).  She will get a refund of all taxes withheld.  She doesn't qualify as head of household, so she can't claim EIC on her return.  If she didn't have any tax withheld, then she doesn't have to file at all.|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	Go on turbotax.com and do it both ways(also do yours without her kid so you know what the difference will be for your return), without hitting the "file" button at end of each process.  See which one brings the most money.  If you claiming her kid gets more money then her doing it, file it that way and give her the difference her child made on your tax return.      FYI: you can only claim her child if they have lived with you for at least 6 months of 2008. You may even be able to claim her as a dependent, depending on her age and whether you are related.  For that answer you should call Jackson-Hewitt or H&R Block to see if you can. Another possible problem would be claiming a child with no relation to you, without some form of custody agreement between you and the mother.  It's another thing to ask the tax service.  Do not go there and ask, because they may charge you or talk you into doing your taxes there.  They charge too much for those who don't bring in 5K or more in return $.  Get the answers to these questions before you file.  IRS is very picky.    Hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|K7x1RHVFaa	She does not fit the definition of a relative and neither does her son so neither of them are deductible on your income taxes. Marry her and you can deduct them both or try and deduct them and have the government declare you married and force you to change the status from HOH to Married filing jointly. All you can legally file for is HOH with one dependent at this point.
XsZsk55Jaa	In order to participate you will have to deposit enough money with the brokerage underwriting the IPO to pay for the number of shares you want.  They will then disperse shares to those wanting them based on how oversubscribed the offering is.  If it is oversubscribed by 10 times you might get only 1/10 of the shares you asked for.  If the offering is that popular it is unlikely you will get any because the big account holders usually get everything.  When the dust settles you will get a refund of your money for the shares you paid for but didn't get.    Is it a good idea to get in the IPO?  This is the first IPO to be offered in about 8 months and nobody knows how well it will be received.  The price could drop below the asking price depending on how much interest there is in the IPO and what people think Rosetta Stones future business prospects are.  If you get it at the IPO price it might be a bargain but then again you might be able to buy it below the IPO price the next day.  There usually is no sure thing.    Personally I am not interested.  They have a very effective marketing program but from what I have read the product isn't very good.  I don't see any big profits here and I don't buy stock in a company whose products I wouldn't buy.    http://www.learnthatlanguagenow.com/rose...

It could state where the key is hidden, the amount owed on the existing mortgage, the reason for selling, state equalized value, etc.     By going to public listings, you should have all the information as a purchaser that you will need. If not, ask your agent.|`|gTFQsIsgaa	Each MLS is different and each listing put into an MLS is usually listed on www.Realtor.com in addition to the broker's (and other's) web sites.  Some MLS listings contain more information on a property than is listed on the public web sites, but all of the information is available through your local county assessor or auditor.  If there is information you would like on a property that you can't find elsewhere, ask your local real estate agents.

Then read this page: http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    I have to mention though:  Just signing a quit claim deed does NOT remove you from liability for any debt you currently had on that home, if you were liable before.  All the QCD does is release your title rights to the property.  If your lawyer told you to file one, and didn't advise you to wait until your boyfriend actually refinanced, and your boyfriend didn't ever complete any refinance (which I'm pretty sure you'll find out is what happened), sue your lawyer for incompetence and malpractice.  Make him pay for you to fix this.    You need to find out for certain if your ex-boyfriend ever completed a refinance first.  If he didn't, the foreclosure against you is unfortunately valid, if you had signed the NOTE for that loan.  Not the MORTGAGE document.  That's just a security instrument.  The NOTE is the only document that will show if you signed and took on liability for the debt.    Sorry for the bad news, but all you can do is do the best with what this crappy situation is.

h1m17rStaa	5.9% is a very good rate, especially for a first card.  Credit cards are not secured by collateral, so they're often charging double digit rates.    Capital One is the cause of a major lawsuit right now against the credit bureaus.  They refuse to report your credit limit to the credit bureaus.  When that happens, the bureaus only use the highest balance as your credit limit.  For many people, this causes your account to look like it's maxed out when you might have thousands of extra credit available.  And any balance over 50% of your available credit limit will hurt your credit scores.    If you take it out, you'd want to max it out once, let it get billed, then pay it off in full.  At least that way, your account should read how it's supposed to in the future, and your credit should improve.    Be very careful about a few things:  Cash advances are not at 5.9%.  They're usually charged at 22% or higher.  And when you pay down your balance, they will ALWAYS apply your payments to the balance with the lowest rates first.  That makes sure you pay the highest rates possible on any money outstanding.    If you ever miss a payment, on this account or any other account you take out, they will charge a default rate as high as 29% or more.  And they reserve the right to change your rates and terms at will, for any reason.  Scary, isn't it?  They can literally just bump your rate up for any reason, or no reason at all.    I personally hate Capital One's business practices.  But they must be doing something good for some people, since they keep growing.      I'd recommend finding a local credit union and applying for a credit card from them.  Not only will they treat you in a much fairer fashion overall, you'll get good service when you need it, and they will actually take time to counsel you about proper usage of credit.    It's very easy to get into bad habits of spending now, and thinking you'll pay for it later.  Soon, you're scraping by just to make the minimum payments on your credit cards, 98% of which pay for interest.    At 18%, a $5000 credit card can take up to 30 years to pay off, if you only pay minimum payments.  And cost you over $22,000 in interest in the process.  Few people realize how quickly the interest eats you up.      Good luck, and keep reading and learning about proper credit usage.  Take a look at sites like myfico or truecredit and read about how credit scoring works.|`|266ab53061468632bd13663beae6a76caa	Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is an expression of the effective interest rate that will be paid on a loan, taking into account one-time fees and standardizing the way the rate is expressed. In other words the APR is the total cost of credit to the consumer expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted. APR is intended to make it easier to compare lenders and loan options.    5.9% is good for someone without any prior credit history, why are you getting such a good rate when i didnt, mine was like 10-15% usually    A good way to build up your credit without going into debt is just to make small purchases on the card and paying it off when the bill comes, usually when you do that they wont charge you interest which means you just pay what the product cost|`|2e7ee769866db0ef127ea60c2c0b99d8aa	Yanswer already said pretyy much what I was going to say.

Since it was before you met him I doubt it.  However, your mutual assets now, if there is money owed to the bank after foreclosure, may have an attachment for his part.  You should definitely speak to an attorney, and if this is true, transfer assets to your name, assuming there are no pending judgments against you, to protect your assets.|`|c533fbcbd4d1ac626e492a2604b907aeaa	You would only be liable if you are on the bank note. If you never signed the bank note, then you are not obligated to pay the loan, and in turn, this cannot affect your credit. Also, if you were never on the note, then the bank would not even have your social security number. Whether your name is on the deed or not (as you indicated it was not), does not affect who is responsible for paying the bank. Only those who signed the bank note are obligated to pay, and the bank may only report the credit issue for those on the note (I am assuming you're not on the note either, but you did not mention this).  Of course, if the loan is not paid, then the bank will eventually seize the property, report your husband to the credit bureaus, force everyone out, and will sell it. So, there's also the issue of where you would live.|`|azhmnAhzaa	It will not affect you per say but it will affect him...they will go ONLY AFTER HIM, not you and it will not affect your credit in any way.

AA10491538	as long as you pay all the interest due, you won't lose any equity on an interest only loan.  if you really need to cut your monthly expenses, this can be a great option.|`|f622afaab91464f20bf3dcc368eecb23aa	You may be interested in this new program.  It works well with a 30, 20, or 15  year mortgage.  I am currently using a HELOC (home equity line of credit) with a new software program that helps build equity fast, and will payoff my home and other loans in less than half the time without refinancing, and without extra payments. It is saving me thousands in interest, and pays off home in less than half the years. Those who take an honest look at all the facts and figures from a reputable source will find that this system truly creates a significant advantage for homeowners.  E-mail me if interested.|`|h1m17rStaa	Well, stop and take a look at what you are doing here.    You'll probably spend $3-5K at least on the refinancing costs, most likely being added to your balance.  It could be much higher.    And from that day on, until you sell, your balance will remain at the same level.      How much are you really saving?  $200?  $500?  Will you change your spending habits or simply find new ways to burn the money?      Please remember, much of what you are saving by taking the interest only loan is what you are actually NOT saving by paying down the mortgage balance every month.  It's no different than putting that money in the bank.  Second, you lose most of that benefit by increasing your loan amount to cover the closing costs.    Is there other debts being consolidated?  Could you achieve most or all of the monthly savings by simply getting a lower rate home equity loan?  At least with that, you pay little to no closing costs, keep paying principal on your mortgage, and will probably be able to save close to the same amount monthly.    A truly ethical loan officer should be able to clearly show you the true cost of this refinance over the next 5 years.  In the end, I doubt it would be your best solution.    Are you even dropping in interest rate?  If not, you are just losing money on this right out of the gate.|`|93b942e36a4d3ec10311e003407e2041aa	It's probably okay; as long as you're not in an area that has experienced unusually high appreciation.

There are lots of factors to consider, such as:  * what your current rate is vs what rate you can get to refi  *what kind of credit you have  *current value of your home vs market "trends" in your area...in some areas property can actually lose value!  *equity you have in the home  *TRUE advantage of the loan - meaning this: is the new loan TRULY beneficial to you? Do you save enough over the 1st two years to absorb the closing costs?  Can you pay some other debt off in the process and lower your payments even more?|`|8ruwONI2aa	Interest only loans are almost never a good idea.  If you are trying to cut down your mortgage payment in order to afford a more extravegant lifestyle, then you are undermining your financial well-being and lengthening the amount of time it will take you to become financially independent (where passive income from investments exceeds your desired expenses).      The only time I'd do an interest only loan is if I was close to paying off the mortgage.  I'd get an interest only loan but pay 3-4 times the required payment, thereby paying off the home in a few short years and saving thousands of dollars (if not tens of thousands) in interest.   Even if you DO have both the desire and the discipline to save/invest the money you wouldn't be spending on your mortgage payment, it's a dangerous set-up.      Also--What if you can't sell in 5 years?  What if interest rates skyrocket? What if you can't refinance because something beyond your control shakes you financially and/or ruins your credit?
274b0b9dfca8f71b58fb8ff55c692e1aaa	If you are asking if you can negotiate a lower price to purchase the home, yes. If you are asking to get a check at closing, no.|`|h1m17rStaa	You can sure try.  Most agents will try to sidewind you into signing a buyer's representation agreement, creating dual agency, and they get to keep the cooperating broker's commission too.  I've had some success getting my clients to get that 3%.  Some have been suckered right into giving it to the agent.  You gotta be tough and stick your ground.    Just refuse outright.  Insist that they present your offer to the seller with the cooperating broker's commission discounted from the price.  If he/she refuses, demand to speak to their broker.  The agent should know better than to try to avoid trying to block a valid offer on their listing, just to get the "whole hog", as it's known in agent's circles when getting both sides of the commission.    And this is why it so rarely makes sense to try to sell on your own, since most offers will come in discounting the price by what you would've paid an agent anyway.  Not your case here, just a point to be made.|`|AA11897359	Claim it on what?  Why would there be anything added to the price?

h1m17rStaa	Ask them to agree to remove it from your credit report if you pay it.  They might agree.    Or, pay it anyway, then dispute it with the credit bureaus.  Ultimately, you did NOT take that debt out.  The fact that you're willing to pay it doesn't really make it yours.  It just makes it go away.    Most of the time, collectors won't respond to disputes to the credit bureaus on paid accounts.  You might have to try a couple times, but eventually it should go.    And just because the collectors validated the debt does NOT mean it's valid for reporting to the bureau.  Just fight it til it's gone.  Or you will keep getting harassed by collectors.  And even more fun is when the debt gets sold and you have ANOTHER collection on your report.  How long will you let that go for $86??|`|5fe278a1c33675b60c15a4dbd692c2f0aa	Just pay it.

h1m17rStaa	Are you certain it applies when you sell?  Some prepay penalties (PPP's) are considered "soft", and only apply if you refinance, so check your closing documents thoroughly.    And it's long since out of the broker's hands, it's now up to the lender that holds your loan today.      But if it's still valid, you can certainly attempt to negotiate it out, and if you're already falling behind on payments, they might agree if they believe they're only other option is that you never pay them again and let the home lapse into foreclosure.  Better to take what they can get now.  Call their loss mitigation department.  Every mortgage company has one.      Good luck.|`|03b29f0a9d7c8bc709ea0d9748a21a7aaa	A mortgage broker does not have anything to do with the prepayment penalty. A mortgage broker is the middle man between you and whatever mortgage company you decide upon.     I can't tell if you are talking about YOUR prepayment penalty on an existing mortgage or the buyer's prepayment penalty. For you, if you have one, you might be able to negotiate it if they think that they're going to have to end up foreclosing-- or they could get their money now from a sale. For the buyer, the mortgage broker has to find a different lender to work with or the buyer has to raise their credit score/downpayment/etc.|`|AA12008845	I have never heard of a bank negotiating pre-payment penalties but considering the expenses involved in a foreclosure there is a good chance that they might consider your situation as an exception.  Once you have an offer, submit it to the lender for their approval with a full explanation of the entire scenario.

But it will take just over 74 payments to pay this off.  Total paid of $74,096.  Subtract the principal of $58,320 and he paid $15,776 in interest.  There is no possibility of a precise figure for the 3 years prior, since we don't know when the extra payments were made.

Not necessarily because their nosey (as some of them are lol), but they are looking to see how well you handle your money throughout the month.

The primary purpose is to look at the deposits, and raise questions if there are unusual deposits that might mean you borrowed your downpayment or something.    If you're under a strict manually underwritten program, having lots of overdrafts will raise a red flag, but they don't go through each transaction and look to see if you have been paying for internet porn or anything.

He is a lawyer and RE investor. His book is a primer as to what can be done and why none of it will be a 100% guarantee. At the same time many of the steps will reduce the risk to something that is entirely manageable.    Note that the umbrella insurance is a part of the solution and a great first step.

AA11869342	Well I have never used a reverse mortgage because I am only 26.  Normally reverse mortgages can only be used by older people (62 and up often).  Basically when someone has a reverse mortgage they do not have to make any payments on the property for as long as they live there.  Instead, payments are made to them using up the houses equity.  The money is given to them in monthly payments or lump sums.  In order to do this you have to own your own home.  You never had to pay back this money unless you decide to move or sell the home.  Otherwise, when you die whomever is giving you the reverse mortgage will take possesion of the home and sell it to get the money paid to you back.  For more info, check out the aarp's website.      http://www.aarp.org/money/revmort/|`|h1m17rStaa	I don't have one, but I am certified to sell them.  For the right person, they're a great product.  You can get a lump of cash, monthly payments, or simply have an equity line to draw cash as you need it.  You can even have a combination of those, depending on how much equity you do have, and your age is a big factor in the availability of funds (younger you are, less money you can get, since you're assumed to be living longer).    You never, ever make another mortgage payment.  If the loan exceeds the value of your home when you die, you (or your heirs) are NOT responsible for any loss.  If there is still equity in the home when you die, your heirs DO get the extra money.    In order to fully apply for the loan, you would have to leave me, and go meet a certified reverse mortgage counselor, and be able to ask any and all questions you could possibly think of, BEFORE being allowed to proceed with the loan.  A great protective measure to make sure you fully understand how the loan can work.    Anyone over 62 with a good amount of equity in their home can potentially benefit from this product.  It is best for someone who has zero intentions of moving for a long time, as the upfront costs are somewhat high (mortgage insurance to HUD, broker fees, etc..).  There is NO credit qualifying required.  We do check your credit, but you cannot be declined due to payment history, since you will not be making any payments anyway.  We only look for outstanding liens and judgments.    They are not right for everyone, but they can be truly life-saving for some people.|`|3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	Here is information on how it works  The four types of Reverse Mortgage programs information: http://www.reversemortgage.org/Default.a...

AA11897220	Both P and D minted coins have errors. Here's a list of valid errors:    Missing Edge Lettering - No edge lettering was applied to the coin. Thousands of Philadelphia Mint specimens reported (some by bank tellers) in Florida; a few hundred coins from Denver known in Chicago. First coin (from Chicago) sold for $612 on eBay; current prices around $200, mostly from Florida.    Double Edge Lettering, Two Runs - Washington Dollar edge lettering appears twice, in two very clear sets of letters, side by side, as in "GGOODD WWEE TTRRUUSSTT." The coin was obviously run through the edge lettering machine twice, and the second run had such perfect placement that the first impression isn't even touched. No coins sold as of yet; appears extremely rare.    Double Edge Lettering, Coin Got Stuck - Edge lettering appears doubled or tripled in a small section where it seems to have gotten stuck in the edge lettering machine. eBay value around $40.    Broken Planchet - The planchet has a small piece broken off before burnishing process, which caused the otherwise normally struck coin to get stuck in the edge lettering machine. Lettering shows multiple times near break, then fades away. Extremely rare.    Extra and/or Out of Place Edge Letters - Similar to the non-errors mentioned above, but these are very clear extra letters of the proper size, some of which appear upside down to the main edge inscription. Maybe the coin went through the edge lettering machine twice, upside down the second time, which obliterated much of the first inscription. Selling for around $35 on eBay. (There is a non-error at nearly $200 though.)|`|h1m17rStaa	I don't know, but I bet these will be hot commodities.      Quite honestly, I think this whole "mistake" is a scam to generate interest in the Fed's 3rd attempt to get Americans to switch over to using dollar coins.  They'll save hundreds of millions of dollars or more if they could fully convert.  But that won't happen until they get rid of the $1 bill.    But it certainly has coin collectors talking, obviously, and the general public will notice.

Construction financing is something that most banks and brokers have ZERO clue how to handle.  So keep talking to people until you find someone who really seems like they know exactly what they are doing, because they've done it dozens of times already.  This is a pretty specialized niche in mortgage lending, and honestly there's maybe 2% of loan officers that know how to do it right.      Some of the contractors might be able to refer you to bankers they know, and most big lumber yards know who they get their checks from too.|`|03b29f0a9d7c8bc709ea0d9748a21a7aaa	Open up a Homes magazine (the kind that are free at the grocery store and have all those for sale houses in it) and find a few of the ads for "HOMES BUILT FOR $XX PER SQUARE FOOT ON YOUR LOT!!""

Only judgments, which normally go hand in hand with a non-payment of rent action, show on the report.  There are screening services that track and compile legal activity (First American Registry and National Tenant Network come to mind) but this is separate from your actual credit file.    Landlords who have access to the credit bureau, normally as customers who pay a fee, can also report your account standing and issue a rating similar to that a credit card or installment loan would.  That tends to be done by larger firms rather than small landlords.|`|h1m17rStaa	It doesn't show up anywhere on a normal bank credit report, unless you got sued and have a judgment for any losses.

But if you apply somewhere new and they do a background check, it shows up on there, and usually stays for ten to fifteen years depending on the state.

h1m17rStaa	There is no real "average", since the severity of injuries varies so dramatically.  Will she be completely healed?  Will she have years of physical therapy that need to be paid for?  Will she ever be fully mobile and painfree in her back again?  How negligent was the store in stacking things that could fall on people and cause these injuries?      All those things add up and up and up.  If she has ongoing medical problems for years or decades, it could be in the millions.  If she's basically fine within a couple months, maybe $50-100K?

Even without your 1099's, just get the best ballpark figure you can, and work off that.  Better to overestimate, than to underpay when you file the extension, to avoid any penalties and interest on any underpayments.    You'd be well advised to seek assistance from a tax professional.|`|dfaa3be04835aae754d345b547705687aa	Why not? are they not legally obliged to provide you with 1099s by January 31?

ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	Don't hold your breath. The way you're supposed to get leads is not the way it happens. The broker in charge gets most of the calls, especially if they are relocations, and they sometimes run those leads themselves, or offer to selected 'people' in the office who they feel can change the caller from a suspect into a prospect.    If you're having to ask, you're probably not one of those people. Sorry. Worked for two major companies before going solo.|`|h1m17rStaa	Most real estate offices offer "floor time", where you are the person who gets to answer the cold calls for that given day or period of time.  Beyond that, with most companies, you're pretty much on your own to generate your business.|`|gTFQsIsgaa	Keller Williams teaches you how to generate leads as opposed to waiting for the phone to ring.  You do get a personalized web site that you can advertise that will bring leads to you. But more important than either of these is the mind set KW will teach you about lead generation.  I would suggest you take their Kamp 4-4-3 class as soon as you become a member of the KW team.  If you follow this system, you will never miss sitting around in an office waiting for a phone to ring!  We know this works from repeatedly encouraging our agents to do this both when they join our team and when they're in a slump.  We've seen it work every time. - And just to be clear, we ARE NOT KW agents! Furthermore, aside from increasing your business without floor time, KW offers a profit sharing plan.  To participate, you only have to share the KW philosophy with other agents. Soon you'll have them joining KW with you and that's all it takes.  Each agent contributes a split to the office and part of that is put into a profit sharing pool to be shared among the participating agents.  The more successful the office is, the bigger the checks that come in, even when you're not doing any business!  I have an MBA and have evaluated the business models of the major players in the industry.  To date, KW is the only firm we recommend outside of our own and we have set our business up to duplicate theirs.  Forget having someone give you leads - you won't need it.|`|03b29f0a9d7c8bc709ea0d9748a21a7aaa	It would vary from office to office. Generally an office has openings for "floor time" which is where you hang out and are the "on call" agent so that if anyone calls who is inquiring about listings, or needs a buyer's agent,  and the receptionist answers, you take the call from her/him.     Beyond that.....not much help is offered. Its hard to get started!    A good trick is that you can offer to host open houses for the more established realtors in your office. They love it becuase they dont have to sit around-- you love it because potential clients walk through the door and you have them sign in with some contact info, and you can tlak to them about whether the house suits their needs, what they'd prefer, etc.    Plus if they DO want to make an offer, you are NOT the seller's agent and they might be willing to use you as a buyer's agent!|`|4658a60eced81abada410cfa0a82efeeaa	As far as Keller Williams goes, and the way they recommend generating leads as an agent. Well to be blunt, I think it's sucks. That's why they aren't a top agency in the Nation.    At Coldwell Banker Gundaker we offer all the above. We do Floor Duty (60% of my business has come from this), we have the most technologically advanced Lead Router System out there (we are notified before the prospective buyer even gets off the computer). Making us  1 in the State and our Sister Company the  1 in the Nation.     Just my 2 cents.|`|0f15d615f3b38c7db5c0f37a935961cdaa	I am a Realtor,  No matter who you work for, the business depends on you.  Your company name does not make for leads, you will.  It's your business.|`|AA10567299	I am an Agent and have NEVER gotten ANY leads from Keller Williams. Maybe if I worked with them I would.   Ask at the interview.
0f15d615f3b38c7db5c0f37a935961cdaa	I am a Realtor Honestly, you should probably get with a Realtor and tell him what you are looking for.  I say this because an area specialist will help you in purchasing the property.  Rather than paying $10,000.00 over the price, the Realtor should know better and lead you in a way that you get the most for your money.  Now every Realtor is not honest so see if there is someone that you trust.  If they have used a Realtor and they recommend them, go with it.  The realtor should be able to guide you through every step.  If you can't find one, I know a good one in the area.  landstonegsl@yahoo.com|`|h1m17rStaa	All I can advise is that you shop around.  Some companies you speak with will have very few loan products to choose from.  Some loan officers you speak with may only know a few loan products.  Some will know dozens.    You could see dramatically different loan offers, which is why it's so important to shop a bit.    http://state.tn.us/thda/    Click this link for the TN housing finance agency.  They'll be able to direct you to some good lenders, and also to see if you are eligible for any type of grants or subsidies for being a first-time buyer.  Call them.      I have a feeling your income might be a little high for them, but I don't know the Memphis area.  Perhaps the neighborhood you are looking at will qualify you for grants regardless of your income.  Those programs work both ways sometimes.    But either way, they're a great resource.  They have first-time buyer counseling classes you can attend (highly recommended!), lenders they can refer you to that are very unlikely to try to screw you, and may just have some free money for you.      Good luck.
h1m17rStaa	Look up tenant's rights for your state.    Most states have a 3-4 week window of time for a landlord to either give you an itemized list of repairs required, or to refund your deposit.  If they don't notify you in time, they lose the right to retain your deposit.    And certainly after 5 years, some wear and tear would be expected.  But they also have to find a way to get rid of the dog smell and hair that gets into everything in the unit.  But it's likely they've already bypassed their legal timeframe to seek remedy from your son, and actually have to refund all of his deposit.
AsIBX4jTaa	Definitly not.    Getting a business as an asset is a great idea.  Congratulations on already getting some financing set up.    Property managment is easier to get into because it requires less capital, but since you will be new to the area, I would not recommend jumping in to this as soon as you get there.  So, lets look at commercial real estate, such as a car wash or service station.    The key to purchasing a good commercial property is completely understanding the business that is on the property.  There is a lot of due diligence you will have to perform.  Be sure you understand exactly what all of the costs are for operating the business, what your revenue is, where it comes from, what you can and cannot do to increase that revenue, how much time you will be putting into managing the asset, how much time you will be putting into operating the asset (if you are planning on doing any), what capital expenses you may have in the next year, five years, 25 years, etc...      In general, I would not recommend planning on putting time into operating the business.  If you are the owner, then you will have plenty to keep you busy just managing the business.  When your management fails, you will end up opperating, so don't plan on doing more than that as well or you will run out of hours in a day.    Determine what kind of property/business you want, how much you want it to cash flow for you, and how much work you want to put into it to be able to get it to cash flow that much.  (Be realistic, but also optimistic.)  Then, go looking for that property in Arizona.  No matter what, don't settle for something less than what you decided you wanted to have.  You'll end up regretting it later.    Good Luck, and welcome to the wide world of "minding your own business."|`|h1m17rStaa	Sounds great to me.  I'd find a business broker and start shopping for the right business.    What's the alternative?  Working for someone else at some mindless desk job?|`|018c836b53fa2824b2c91af8c28632ffaa	Genius. Am i stupid?|`|c6iZWFcxaa	You will be stupid for not jumping at this chance.    And by the way don't ask a stupid question again|`|AsgUsNB3aa	not really but it is a kind of stupid idea you just need to save money until your store gets business so one way to save is get energy efficiency and second you need to not start out with a lot of products trust me I've bee there before
sAbI0aRyaa	Go with the Realtor that posted the pic. If you do then this Realtor will be a buyer agent. The owner/ Broker will be the sellers agent. The buyers agent has a obligation to protect you and your interests. There could be something wrong with the house that you don't know about. The Realtor should be able to detect possible problems. As for the price, depends on the market but it never hurts to offer a lower amount, whats the worst that will happen they counter offer a higher amount, there is harm-no foul.|`|h1m17rStaa	If you already have a realtor you're working with, definitely bring him/her.  If you aren't working with one already, it'd be a good idea to find one.    Make whatever offer you feel is justified and that you're comfortable with.  They may simply counter-offer with a higher price.  They may take your offer and run.  They likely have attorney fees and even some lost interest to cover, so the $109K is unlikely to be their real cost.  They don't need to make money, but they'll do whatever they can to not lose more money either.    When negotiating with REO's, you MUST have a preapproval letter from a bank or broker.  So get that done first.  Just make sure your letter doesn't say "preapproved for $160,000" when you're offering $120,000.  Have it list "preapproved for purchase of X property".  Don't show them all your cards upfront.
4658a60eced81abada410cfa0a82efeeaa	In my State (Missouri) it's about 10-40% off in most areas. My home was listed $65,000 lower than what it actually appraised out for and sold for.     I wouldn't trust that website at all. It's too risky especially if your basing your sale price off the site. Your home will sell super fast though!|`|h1m17rStaa	They'll give you their "zestimate".  Keep clicking, and you'll find that their real range will vary by $30,000 up or down from that value, possibly more.    It is a very broad estimate, based on tax values and sale data.  If you go in and select all the attributes to your house, you might pin down a tighter estimate, but don't take it as gospel.  It's still just a computer guessing at a value.    There's still no substitute for a certified, licensed real estate appraisal.|`|03b29f0a9d7c8bc709ea0d9748a21a7aaa	Semi-accurate. You need to look at it as a 'starting idea' for how much something is worth and also look at what homes are listed for in the area. It doesn't actually look at ANYTHING specific to the house besides the "stats"-- lot size, house size, bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, etc.     A hoome could be really run down and sell for a price that reflects that, and Zillow may believe that reflects  a down turn in the market and the other houses might drop a slight bit. Or your house might be recently remodeled with granite counteropts, new windows, etc, and Zillow is too low.     For my area its about 5% lower than what houses are really going for-- but fairly close!!

Plus, from what I've understood,  you don't really have any control over the potential increase in yearly fees.

Fees and resale value.      Check into the annual fees.  Compare that to the cost of a hotel where you would purchase the timeshare.  Look into the resale market for your particular timeshare.  There are websites that sell timeshares online and people sell them on eBay.  Will you be using the timeshare or renting it out?  If you rent it out, will you recoup your investment or only your fees?      Good luck.|`|f5d437ced2fb03cc831bc300fe98e580aa	Just Google "timeshare bad investment" and you'll get almost a million hits.  That should tell you everything you need to know right there.|`|h1m17rStaa	There must be dozens of websites, blogs and other forums where people discuss timeshares.      In general, regardless of what is said in the sales pitch, they do NOT appreciate in value.  If you sell it, you will lose money.    So, buying a resale is probably the most cost-effective approach.  But be cautious of who you buy from, make sure you are getting what you think you are, and since there's hundreds of different resorts, do your homework.  Interval International is one company that arranges for timeshare swapping and stuff like that, so they'll have pictures, descriptions, and ratings for hundreds of these resorts.      Take your time, keep doing tons and tons of homework, and hopefully you can find some good contacts out there online who will give you genuine advice based on their own experiences.    Good luck.

This will help you see what the market is selling for in that area.You should ask to see the most recent sales if none have occured you should research closed sales within the last 3- 6 months.Also adjustments are made for ex.if a double wide has new cabinets kitchen and stove an adjustment should be made for a higher value also very inportant is the sq. footage for adjustments one duoble could be 900 square feet while one that sold is 875square feet an adjustment needs to be made.Also factors involving price is how the area is doing are they building a school nearby that would make the price higher or are they building a jail which would drive prices lower.I would drive around to see if there any other doubles up for sale witin a miles radias and see what conditions they are in and what the selling prices are.

h1m17rStaa	http://ihcda.in.gov/    That's the Indiana Housing and Community Development Agency.    They've got lots of info for first-time buyer programs, all the grants and subsidies and free money and all that good stuff.    They also have lenders they work with who specialize in providing these types of loans (and they are special, not everyone offers them.  Not by a longshot).      Contact them and ask for help.  Talk to some of their lenders.  Talk to more than one, make sure you're getting the right information.    You could probably get an FHA loan in conjunction with some federal grants and subsidies.  A first-time buying single mom is definitely on their list of people they're trying to help.  Being of color or buying in targeted neighborhoods are often qualifiers too.  Targeted neighborhoods are ones where they are trying to establish long-term ownership, which will often bring stability to a neighborhood, often in tough or blighted areas where they want people to move in and fix up the homes.    Making payments on medical collections, as compared to simply paying them off, no difference on your credit.  Collections don't work that way.  Try to settle them if possible.  If you are uninsured, you are already being grossly overcharged compared to what they charge insurance companies, so maybe you can get lucky and save some money.    And putting $30,000 down on your home will absolutely lower your payments.  Whoever says otherwise is just wrong.  That should lower your payments by $250-300 per month.  That's a lot of money for most people.  Though I would recommend keeping at least a few grand for cash reserves, just in case.  Maybe put $20K down and keep $10K in the bank for emergencies?   Having some cash reserves on top of a still healthy $20K down payment can actually help the approval, more so than putting every penny as downpayment.  The banks do like to know, and prefer, that you can weather a bump or two without falling behind.    Avoid any lender that won't take the time to help you qualify for at least an FHA loan.  They aren't hard to qualify for, credit-wise, and if you can't qualify today, you probably could in 6-12 months.  Much better to wait than take a crappy subprime mortgage with high adjustable rates.  If you've seen the news lately, almost 1 in 5 people taking those loans can't make the payments.  So don't just accept one, wait for a good loan.    Who knows.  You  might find that the state will give you an extra $10,000 to $30,000 in assistance to buy a home, and give you a fixed rate under 6.00%.  Contact them and get started.    Good luck.|`|AA12197384	Let me first start off with why do you feel you need to purchase a home in indiana?  From what i've seen its much cheaper to rent than own a place there unless your putting 50% or more down.  I've been seeing property values dip in the past months and i don't think they are going up anytime soon.  I think you should wait a few more years and let the real estate froth settle down.  You being a single mother, I would hate to see you purchase that home knowing that in a year your going to owe more than its worth!  A foreclosure is the last thing you need on your credit.    Hope this helps!|`|d9b2d3028d55a1b9c917f926dfe7a89eaa	A mortgage broker sees you have 30K in savings and says next to nothing about lowering your debt.    $3,500 in debt is not bad unless you make minimum wage.    To get your credit in better shape, start paying down your debt with your savings.  Having 30k in a bank making .075 percent interest and paying loans at 21% interest is not the greatest move.  If your medical payments are low interest use them to establish credit, otherwise pay them off.      Look at your statements.  Pay off the loans with the highest interest rate now.  This will cut your outgo quickly.      The broker neglected to tell you to try to find a home where your payments will be equal or lower than your current rent.  This will ensure you are paying no more than you are today BUT when you get to your taxes, you will find a large refund, ensuring you are paying less for mortgage than rent.      Call a few real estate agents in the area you wish to move to.  Explain your situation, pick the one you feel most confident will find you a home and stick with you through the process.  They know the laws and will ensure you get into a place you can afford.  A good real estate agent will work with you on a first time buyer program if you bring it up with him/her.    Whatever you do, do not get a variable rate interest or one that has a balloon payment.  Variable interest may go down, but if it goes up, you may find yourself out on the street as many will be soon if not already.      I have seen too many people loose their homes because they had a balloon payment and no one would give them the 50k to save their homes.    The only authority I am in real estate is, I have owned three homes.     My credit authority is through the lessons I have learned about credit, I have learned the hard way, by bringing up 6 kids, with a great wife.    Now is the time to buy, you can get good deals with the slow market.    Good luck|`|E072YWBIaa	For buying a house Credit History is much more important than credit score. Often, the lack of credit history is equated with bad credit. You should be aware that lenders will go through your credit report once you apply for loan for buying a house. Therefore you should polish your credit report. Anyway, in order to establish a good credit history and at the same time risen your credit score in a short time do following things:    1) Close all of your credit cards but one. It reflects in your credit report and it is a very good sign. For instance say that you have 5 credit cards with $1000 credit limit for each. Therefore you are responsible for $5000 of possible debt. But when you close 4 of them, now you are only responsible for $1000 of debt which lowers the level of risk of lending money to you.     2) If you have any loan, like car loan or any balance on your credit cards, try to pay more than your monthly payment for 6 months or something. I mean say your monthly due on your car loan is $150, try to pay $250 each month. Lenders can see these trends in your credit report and they see that youre a responsible borrower.  If you dont have such loans, I suggest getting a $3000-$4000 loan and paying it off in full in 5-6 months. You might pay $200-$300 of interest but you will save thousands of dollars in your home mortgage and interest rates.     Also checkout http://www.howtoestablishgoodcredit.com/...

If you were keeping the property then you might want to change the vesting just to be accurate, but since you are selling it now that is just a waste of time.      Your wife will just have an extra form to sign - this is not a big deal, and nothing to be concerned about.|`|h1m17rStaa	There's no need to make this change.  You will likely be asked by the title company to provide a copy of your marriage certificate though, to prove the name change.

Standard procedure on any deal like this.    Once you get your house actually sold, you'll pick a title company to close with.  Talk to them, mention the wife/name change, and they'll know that it needs to be addressed and they'll take care of everything, and let you know what documentation, if any, they'd ask you to provide.

AA10074148	You have to figure out if the loan would pay off all your debts and lower the monthly payments you are making each month.     In most cases the interest, fees and other associated cost to get this loan is tax deductable (Check with your tax consultant for tax information)    The problem I find with most people doing this is that 2-3 years later they are right back where they were to begin with back in debt.    They fail to rip the credit cards up, limit spending, start a savings with the extra money left over. They continue to spend because now all the credit cards have a "ZERO BALANCE" so they go on a spending spree.    Most just add to the credit cards a little at a time and before they realize it the card is back at $5000, along with the rest of the cards.    So my answer is unless you plan to change your spending habits, get rid of some of your credit cards, resist impulse buying and go on an aggressive savings then you will not benefit. Check with you banker for a savings program that will be taken directly from your check each pay period.    An emergency is not buying your child a pair of $250 sneakers. I hope I am getting the message to you about spending becaues it does not take much to be in the same situation as before and all the fees, closing cost that you paid to pay off these debts has been useless.      If you can do all the above then go for it. Normally an equity loan would satisfy these debts.     I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|h1m17rStaa	It really depends on how you use it.  If taking out the equity loan means paying off all your other debts, collections, whatever else you have, and brings your payment to a point where you can afford to live without using any other credit cards or debt again, it can make sense.    Too many people though, pay off their credit cards with their home equity, then go run up their cards all over again.    So, talking to a real credit counselor (not one who simply wants to slap you into their payment plans), and working out a real budget you can stick to, is the best place to start.      If you don't make changes to your spending habits, this idea might just be your first step into true financial hell though, as you will be putting your home at risk.    Step one:  Make a list of every single thing you spend money on for 30 days, including bills, eating out, coffee, vending machines, etc...  Everything.  You should be able to identify $200-400 in wasted money you can trim back on.  If you can't discipline yourself enough to write down ALL of your expenditures for 30 days, using your home equity may not be a wise idea.|`|3c1fc26a5a7e3b2a6fe51fb3b9191297aa	No. If you are having real financial trouble go see a debt counsellor first.

b74ff237fbce78cf31d8b19ea1a57b8caa	You will have a low credit score either way, as the score is a subjective assessment of your past debt payment habits.     The bankruptcy advantage is that the debt is effectively eliminated so you can more quickly begin the process of "proving" that you can and do pay your "credit" on time.    If you choose the bankruptcy route there is a clearly defined process and a predictable timetable - you must wait a minimum of  9 months after the bankruptcy application to be "discharged" when all debt is legally eliminated. The bankruptcy will be reported on your credit bureau for 6 years from the date of your discharge. You will then need to obtain one "reportable" credit account, such as a secured Visa or M/C (even if it only has a small credit limit), use the card sparingly but make sure you make EVERY payment when it is due. After satisfactory operation of this card for a year, you should be able to  obtain some form of "normal" credit and after paying the "normal" credit account for a year, you should have a credit bureau score in the 670/680 range, even with the bankruptcy on your file.    So here is a summary of how long the process will take if you choose the bankruptcy route:  9/12 mos bankruptcy / discharge  1 year - secured card  1 year - paying normal credit   TOTAL 3 years (minimum) to acceptable credit score    Balance this timetable against how long it will take to payoff your "numerous items" - obviously if it will take you 5 or more years to pay them off, it's a "no brainer".  If your existing debt is "in collection" (meaning that even if you make payment arrangements with each creditor, it will not show in your credit bureau every month that you are in fact making the agreed upon payments), then even after you finally pay off the debts, you will be at the same point you would be after the "bankruptcy discharge" - no debt and a low credit score.....and you will still need to go through the 2 year secured card etc process. Your increasing credit score will however, not be "held down" by as much of for as long as it would be if you had the bankruptcy on your file.    There are lots of hoops to jump through if you go the bankruptcy route and you will need a bankruptcy trustee to explain them all to you.    I have written this response for the sole purpose of explaining the future credit implications if bankruptcy is chosen.|`|h1m17rStaa	I've seen people that filed BK after getting a huge lawsuit or some other big incident.  They never missed a payment on anything.  Within 1 year, they had scores over 680.      Miss a ton of payments, let things go to collection, and you'll be in the low 500's for your scores after a bankruptcy.    Better to nip it in the bud, if it's practical to do so.  It's a pretty rare case that someone gets one big bill so large they have no choice but to wipe it out in a bankruptcy though, when everything else was going perfectly otherwise.  So most people's credit already sucks by the time you file BK anyway.  In that case, it really doesn't have that much more impact.|`|3e1433c6f5c0370ada723f76b1277e25aa	A BK can definitely be a lot worse. It also might be better. Sorry in advance if that does not make the choice clearer.    You will have the BK on your public record for a long time. It will be on your credit report for 7 years.    After the BK many of the credit accounts that get closed are still going to be on the credit file and show as negatives.    You will have less debt that you owe and a better cash flow compared to before the BK. Hence you ability to pay any future obligations is improved.    Some lenders will be much more willing to work with you after 2 years from when your BK is discharged. They look at your cash flow. Other lenders will continue to have issues with the BK being there.    You really need to get some professional advice as to what is going to happen if you file and how it might change the present situation.     If you were to work out a payment plan and otherwise catch up over time you may find that it takes longer for your score to improve but it improves faster or to a higher level given you do not have a BK on your record for 7 years.
h1m17rStaa	What this allows, is for you to actually use the equity you are being given, in a form that's actually useful to you, in that it should reduce your rate, mortgage insurance, etc...     The gift needs to be accounted for for tax purposes, but only to the extent that whoever is giving it to you would exceed the amount you could get without paying estate tax upon their death.  Unless their estate is worth $1 million or more, it's a non-issue.    They simply sign a form from the lender that they are giving you this gift, and there is no repayment required.  Plain and simple, and it should save you money.    It will have a very nominal increase in closing costs for the seller, however, since the deed tax will be based off a higher sales price.  We're talking maybe $200-300 on the high end.  There could be a capital gains issue if they haven't lived in the home as their primary residence for at least 2 of the past 5 years as well, but if that's the case, you'll need to find a CPA before you proceed.

I am unsure about other relatives.  I believe parents/grand parents can also make a larger one time gift within the unified estate/gift limits without a taxable event.  Check with a tax pro and/or an attorney.    If the family member does not fit the requirements of the gift tax laws you may have to declare the gift as income.  Again - consult a tax pro.
h1m17rStaa	I'm in the US, not UK, but I have a feeling the same basic principles apply.    As a broker in the US, when I deliver a loan to an investor, they charge me anywhere from $300-600, for their underwriting and closing document costs.    I also have to pay my own processor to help get the loan closed.  Figure another $300 per loan.    Ideally, I can pass these costs on to my clients directly, and give them a lower rate than I could if I had to pay those fees from my yield from selling the loan.    Here in the US, these are affectionately known as "junk fees".  No one believes they're valid at all.  But the reality is, yes you'll pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over 30 years on a loan.  But that loan may only last 3-5 years, 7 years on the high end.  So that's some money, certainly, but the bank's take on your full interest payment is generally quite small, it's the bond investors who get most of it.    Salaries for the people who did actually process, underwrite, and close your loan, must be paid today, not with a fractional piece of your interest charges over time.  That's the bottom line reason why they are charged.    Some banks will upcharge the interest rate and lower or remove these junk fees.  But in almost all cases, the broker still has to pay those costs, so you either pay for them directly or indirectly.  But it's always you paying them.      Hope that helps a bit.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Most of those extra fees are simply add ons they use to make extra money.   The application fee, underwrting fee, credit score check, loan origination fee, ect ect. All these things are negiotable to a certain point. Some lenders are so hungry for buisness they waive fees other lenders may charge. Afterall, they are still making a profit any way to cut it.|`|AA10326310	They are profit padding fees. They're just there to increase the lender's profits. Of course you will pay some, but look for the one that has the lowest. Some of them are required by law. Also, beware of the ones that say they have no fees, because sometimes they factor it into the APR instead.|`|rzjIWEPLaa	Most of the morgages I have had, had arrangement fees of around 200. Personally I would shop around. One of the things you should really look out for is penalty fees, if say you decided to change your morgage part way through your fixed term. These can be horrendous. Check out the flexible mortagages like Virgin one and the Abbey do one as well. There is an arrangement fee but you can save a lot of money with  this if you have any savings or can afford to up the minimum payment a little each month. The down side is that you are at the mercy of interest rates. If the interest rates  do start to creep up you can change your mortgage type for a fixed rate without any penalty fees.
S4swOoyDaa	Congratuations on having good credit and being in a situation to get a mortgage based on your credit/income alone. The fact you can get a mortgage with or without your finacee signing puts you in a very unique situation.  Usually most couples need both to sign to qualify for a mortgage.    That said, I absolutely recommend you contact a number of reputable mortgage lenders (ask your friends and family which lenders they've used and trust) and see what rates you are offered, with and without your fiancee.  Then you can just pick the best the best one!  What more could you ask for?    Honestly, based on the numbers you've stated, I think you are going to get the best rates anyway (with both on the mortgage), so I don't think you have to worry.    In regards to putting your fianc on the mortgage after closing, in most cases you would have to refinance the mortgage in order for that to occur. And to add her to the deed but not the mortgage would require you to deal with your assessor's office (or county clerk) and you would probably want to get a lawyer to make sure it was done right... it would be a pain.    I would not recommend that.    Just find a mortgage professional you trust and compare your options.  I think you are going to find that you are in a win-win situation.|`|AA10471659	Just as much as Yours. those aren't scores that would cause much problems for you.

In your case i would not worry since BOTH of your scores are good enough to qualify.

4NEYlFYPaa	I am sure there are enough pros who are able to do what you challenge them to though it is not easy!! However if they could they probably are and I am quite sure they are not going to give you 50% of the profits... but I don't think that is your question you want to know if the scenario is possible, right?    I would however not set a one day target as beating the market everyday is not realistic. Most stocks do not move very much in one day, most big changes occur over many months and sometimes years!! Warren Buffet the greatest investor of all times does not buy and sell stocks daily. He doesn't even see what the market is doing; he knows what it is doing inside his head, he just sometimes checks up to make sure people aren't being stupid!! Day trading does not make you an investor it makes you a gambler and I know I would have more fun at the casino gambling my money away than on the stockmarket (where I can't dress up nice and buy a drink when I feel like it... also the atmosphere inside a casino is very exciting)    Are you actually looking for a day trading pro to do this for you? Unfortunately I don't think you will find someone if you are, since your challenge, though enticing and good for you is not very apealing to the pro. Having to pay out 100% of the loss is painful even to a pro :-) However the closest you will get to this is a mutual fund that will guarantee you your start amount. This is a very safe method of investing and while it doesn't have a very high return (since it is so safe and the money to make up for losses has to come from somewhere) the money manager will give you 100% of the profit (after fees of course) and that is also better than giving away 50% of the profits...    If you do find a pro willing to take you up on your offer let us know!! If you don't and don't want an insured mutual fund then I would advise you to study investing so you can beat the market yourself!!    Good luck whatever your goals are!!|`|AA12234999	the answer is NO!|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	No.  Nobody is going to accept 100% of the downside risk for only 50% of the profits on the upside.  ///

AA11206283	We do a lot of "back to back" Sell one property and turn around and buy the next|`|h1m17rStaa	Puddin is right, in that splitting the sellers and buyers and closing them in separate rooms or even an hour or two apart isn't uncommon.    However, sometimes double closings, depending on what they are, could be a cause for concern.    What was the other closing for?  Was there someone who bought your property from the seller, then turned right around and sold it to you?  If so, that type of transaction, known as flipping, can be a red flag for fraud.    The classic "flipping" scam is where someone gets you to buy a property for, say $200,000.  It's really only worth $150K.  They buy it for $150K from the real seller, then sell it to you for $200K, using a fraudulent, inflated appraisal, and they pocket the difference.    This is the reason why many banks require a full 2-year history of all sales of a property now, called "chain of title".  They want to make sure that the owner of the home at the time of the purchase agreement is the same one who is still actually the seller when you buy, and that someone else didn't jump in the middle.    So, if your transaction matches anything like what I've described above, perhaps it should be looked into more closely.    There's one last possibility, but I assume doesn't apply to you, that has to do with new construction and having a construction loan along with your permanent end financing.  If that's your case, that's very common to have two closings as well.    Good luck.

They try to confuse you by saying that the $3m project is very risky, but because NPV already takes into account risk, that's meaningless.  NPV might have discounted the $5m project down to $3m, but since its still higher you take that one.    BTW in the real world, this kind of thinking will get you in big trouble and you would want to do a much more detailed risk analysis and probably create a series of pilot projects to test your risks and assumptions.  This is an area where academia falls far short of practice.
h1m17rStaa	Processing fee, underwriting fee, administrative fee, doc prep fee, etc...    Lots of people complain about these fees.  And most people just don't understand them.     Yes, there will be profits from interest over the course of the loan.  But the bank you make your payments to get very little of it, a tiny fraction actually.  In order to maintain a staff to be able to actually do the underwriting, processing, and closing of the loans, they have to make some money upfront.    We also process and underwrite loans all the time for people who don't end up closing for whatever reason.  We pay for credit reports for people that don't close.  We spend real money, sometimes lots of it, on loans that never close, often without requiring any upfront financial commitment from the potential client.  Because everyone seems to think they're somehow entitled to borrow money, and they shouldn't have to pay for the privilege.  And they want it in shorter and shorter timeframes.  It used to take 30-60 days to close a loan.  Now it can be done in as little as 24 hours.  And that takes people, lots of people, because it seems that the only way to compete is to be the easiest and fastest to work with.    So, if we can agree that salaries need to be paid, in order to have enough people working to make these loans available to you, then the question is how you would rather pay for it.    Option  1.  Pay a few hundred bucks upfront as a processing and/or underwriting fee.    Option  2.  Take a higher rate, and let your lender make that money up through the higher yield they receive when the loan is sold to the bond market.  A 0.125% rise in interest rate on a $250,000 loan will cost you only $26/mo.  $312 over 1 year. $624 over 2. and on and on and on.  The average loan lasts about 5-7 years.  If you're in that same loan for 5 years, you will have paid $1560 more in interest, instead of perhaps $300-700 upfront.  And it could easily cost more than .125% more to cover those costs, depending on loan size, loan product and market conditions, further increasing the additional cost of covering those costs.    In general, it's usually best to pay the actual costs associated with your loan, and take the lowest rate you can get.  A typical exception, however, would be if you have some reason to believe you'll have sold or refinanced again within the next 2-3 years, in which case the higher rate and lowest costs might be best, because your higher monthly payments wouldn't be there long enough to eventually cost more than the upfront costs would have been.|`|AA11860478	Unnecessary fees they're hoping you won't question in all the paperwork fatigue that accompanies a real estate closing.    Stuff like "funding fees" (aka wire transfers, which cost nowhere near $50).

At this point, to go from a CNA to an RN, you Appl Sci degree prob won't be of much help to you except that you could maybe have your general ed requirements satisfied if you decide to go for a baccalaureate in nursing (BSN). Your other option would be to get your ADN or Assoc degree in nursing and become an RN. Prob get done faster that way, and likely to start at same pay.    A nurse practitioner is an advanced practice nurse, which requires a master's degree. An RN has only an assoc or bacc.    A licensed practical nurse (LPN) on the other hand, has none of the above. They have a certification and are somewhere in between CNA's and RN's. However, I do not recommend this route.

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a personal development system developed in the early 1970s. It uses a toolbox of strategies, axioms and beliefs about human perception and subjective experience.    NLP's core idea is that an individual's thoughts, gestures and words interact to create one's perception of the world. By changing one's outlook, therefore, a person can improve his attitudes and actions. These observations can be changed by applying a variety of techniques.    NLP teaches that a person can develop successful habits by amplifying helpful behaviors and diminishing negative ones. Positive change can come when one carefully reproduces the behaviors and beliefs of successful people. It also states that all human beings have all the resources necessary for success within themselves.|`|AhZy0Rywaa	NLP stands for neuro-linguistic programming.The idea is that by changing one's outlook a person can improve his attitudes and actions.

On the other hand, domestic resources engaging in the production of goods and services abroad are excluded from the GDP.GDP is measured both in current and constant prices. GDP at current prices or nominal GDP measures the value of output at the prices prevailing in the period during which the output is produced, while GDP at constant prices or real GDP measures the value of the output produced in any one period at the price of the base year.Gross National Product (GNP) of an economy refers to the value of domestically produced goods and services in their final forms, during a specific period of time, thereby utilizing production factors owned by domestic residents of the economy.

As to putting in more than 6%, it depends on the funds your employer offers, usually an index fund, growth fund, value funds, international fund, and a fixed income fund are options (along with company stock).      With the market as nervous as it is at this time, I'd put 1/2 in an international fund and the other half in fixed (awaiting for the market to get over it's jitters).    With these options available, I'd try to max out the $15,500 tax free dollars available.  If you don't have these options, you can sign up with a discount broker and put $5000 into an IRA.

You also get that you get to re-invest your earnings from the 401k.    At the end of the day, I think it comes down to two things.  The quality of the choices offered in your 401k by your employer, and your interest in paying a lot of attention to your investments.  In my experience the best way to lose money is to invest it and not pay attention.  It takes research, watching the markets, and focus.

I'm an Ohio REALTOR.  If you need assistance, let me know.|`|h1m17rStaa	You can offer to pay from 3-6% towards your buyer's closing costs and prepaid expenses.  That's perfectly legal.    When it becomes illegal is when you attempt to transfer dollars to the buyer, that are not directly reflected on your settlement statement.  Under-the-table cash, or you writing a personal check after closing to give to them, for example.    Reason being, that cash rebate you give the buyer is really based on an inflated purchase price.  If you buy a home for $100,000, but get $5000 in cash back after closing, you really only paid $95,000 for that home.  So the lenders will treat this as they should have only financed based on the $95,000 purchase price (regardless of appraised value).    And all real estate transactions must comply with RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act), the laws and guidelines established by the federal Housing and Urban Development Agency (HUD).  This set of laws supercedes any state laws regarding this particular issue.  So it has no bearing if you're in Ohio or California.      Cash rebates after closing would be treated as fraud.  So don't do it.  You can legitimately and legally offer to pay their closing costs and prepaid expenses (insurance, tax escrows).  You can offer to fund a temporary buydown.  Heck, if your buyer is using FHA for their financing, you can even use some programs to give them a gift for their downpayment on your home.  Look up Nehemiah for details on that.

This happens all the time as long as the money back/incentive to the buyer is to be used for closing costs, prepaids or points.    Now, lets say the buyer has no costs whatsoever, giving money back is not allowed legally especially if the lender has knowledge of it.  As a lender, I would advise my buyers against it. If you were to do this outside of the closing table, then you can do that without anyone's knowledge, although the buyer and potentially you would be taken a risk.     Instead, offer to pay their closing costs.  Offer to pay their 1 year insurance premium or their taxes for the year.

wY30NbRdaa	The term "subprime" describes a type of mortgage for borrowers with bad credit. It's neither good nor bad, just a category.    Subprime mortgages, like any other type of credit for people with bad credit, tend to have higher interest rates than loans for people with good credit. Subprime mortgages typically have a two- or three-year pre-payment penalty.|`|h1m17rStaa	"Subprime" mortgages are those loans given to people with weak credit or an inability to properly document their income, or both, often with low downpayments, or used as consolidation loans when refinancing.    They are good, to a degree, in that they do serve a useful purpose in allowing more people access to home financing.      Bad, however, is the fact that most of them are done with short-term teaser rates.  Most common is an adjustable-rate loan that has a low fixed rate for 2-3 years.  The rates can jump substantially after that, increasing your monthly payments by 50% or more overnight in some cases.      Also bad, is that most subprime loans are sold with prepayment penalties.  So, if you are even eligible to refinance into a prime loan, it can potentially cost you thousands of extra dollars when you pay off the loan early, usually within the same 2-3 year period.    They can be useful sometimes to help someone consolidate debt and reduce payments, especially if they've had trouble in the recent past that can be fixed by paying off collections or other debts and getting your credit cleaned up.  As long as you can refinance quickly before the rate adjustment and payment hike wipe you out, it's not bad, and can actually help some people get their financial lives back on track.    Overall, most people should do their best to avoid them if at all possible.  There's a reason that almost 1 in 5 subprime loans written in the last 2-3 years are behind on their payments.  High risk, high rates, and given to people who can barely afford them.

Once they stop accepting anything but payment in full, usually once you get past 90 days (they won't accept 1-2 payments, only all 3, for example), it really shouldn't matter what you have in the bank.    But if you're just trying to sell your home and owe more than it's worth, and you have cash you could use to make it right, and you'd rather just go buy a car instead, that's just crap.

If you financed over 80% of the property in one loan the lender assessed something called PMI to your monthly mortgage payment, but that insurance only protects the lender, not the homeowner.  After closing, go to your local insurance company and inquire about Mortgage Insurance.  They have a decreasing term policy that adjusts with the mortgage amount as you pay it down so that if a death or disability occur, the mortgage will be paid off.|`|4bc3b10429090a5d915696c5d42b75b2aa	If you purchased mortgage insurance, it will be on the financing statement (also called a HUD statement).

Presumably you were already a couple months behind, and they probably had initiated the foreclosure proceedings?    If so, your credit is damaged pretty good.

Just get to rebuilding your credit with new, clean tradelines as soon as you can get them.  That's about all you can do at this point

J0bqxozSaa	All the products in villa moda have to be original as there are counterfeit laws in Kuwait. In addition, Gucci and Fendi would not be working with majed al-sabah if they were not original products. The thing with villa moda is that his mark ups are so high that if he sells 1/4 of the goods he buys, he is probably making a profit right there. Also, selling something in a sale at 90% does not mean that he is selling it below cost price. It is just consumer psychology that makes you think you are getting a good deal. I work in the retail industry and the mark ups that we can put are ridiculously high, specifically in Kuwait and the GCC since there are people with disposabe income that are willing to pay premium prices for the goods. Do not forget that Villa moda has exclusivity to many designer brands in kuwait, which gives him a monopolistic edge.

Before, to own 1 share, you need to pay $78. But now, to own 1 share, you pay $39.     Fundamentally, there is no difference to the company in terms of earnings/eps or even voting power.     But the good news is that with the enlarged shares base, more investor will be able to get into the action -    1. it is cheaper to own now.  2. lower denomination thus more upside when increase in price (eg a $1 in $39 = 2.6% and a $1 increase in $78 = 1.3%)    Generally, it is a good news and usually shares get a bump up in price when this is annouced. This was very popular in the late 90s when price like Yahoo and Microsoft share price sky rocket and became unaffordable to the common man.     Reversely look at Berkshire which cost $100K per share - however, their aim is very different and the share price still do very well.

Considering i am a graduate of Bentley, having people ask me if we live in tents just makes me wonder who is better educated? my friends in kuwait who are mostly phd and master graduates or my friends in the states some of which are barely college graduates! Well, for one the living standards in kuwait and the quality of life is much higher than anything you would ever see in the states. Second of all, it is one of the safest places you would ever be able to go to in the middle east. Also, you will not be put in a compound as foreigners are not treated like animals but you choose your place of stay. Alcohol is allowed on the american bases just show your passport. No taxes the money is all yours. I would definately take it!      Don't listen to the last person who is obviusly not a kuwaiti citizen. Tell me where in the west could you get ten sandwiches for three dollars? or fifteen cokes for that amount as a matter of fact! Keep into consideration the west take taxes where as in kuwait they dont. You have to pay not only taxes on income but also taxes on clothing and practically everything you buy. In kuwait you dont have to. You have to pay for parking in the west in kuwait only in shopping malls.

When you follow other people's advice (OPA) and it fails, what have you learned?  Zip.  Nada.  Zero.  OPA is for suckers.  Don't fall into that trap.       When you do your own homework even if it turns out to be wrong, you learn from it and get better - it's called experience.       Investing is like a scientific hypothesis - you hypothesize that based on your investigation and knowledge, this stock should go up and make a profit.  Sometimes your hypothesis is wrong and it's back to the drawing board.       If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/comme...       Don't be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web.         If you have lots of time before retirement  the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing and re-investing your proftis every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won't amount to much in 30 year owing to the the ravages of inflation.  But stocks are a good hedge against inflation.      By that time you may need a money manager  to manage your money - probably before when you reach the $500,000 mark.  Heck!  If you have achieved that much, you probably don't need a money manager - you are the best judge of where to invest your money by that time.      And that's the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death.       When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a "load", an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better.       Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%.       AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice.      You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates.       Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don't have to ask what stocks to invest in.         Be self reliant.         Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.       Find stocks that have steadily rising net profits (earnings), low debt, and good P/Es, lots of cash, companies buying back their stock..       What interests you?  Find stocks that pique your interest and passion.      You need fast growing good stocks with good earnings and in good sectors.  You need to learn more about the stock market before you even think about investing in it.      The stocks world is divided into 12 sectors such as energy which chevron belongs to.  It is next to last in the sectors list today.       Technology is numero uno, but things can change in a new york minute, but within the sector, the fastest growing are computer services, not Microsoft.  Then,  Electronic Instruments and controls.  Next is computer storage devices.       The next hot sector is Healthcare, but heed the warning below.  Go here for sectors:  (http://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/I...      The best software is Vector Vest if you can afford it.  It has sector investing.       Here is a free Web site for charting stocks:  (http://www.incrediblecharts.com/).       First of all, stay away from "professional brokers" and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.   And tips at Yahoo! Answers.  And e-mail tips.  Do your own due diligence - don't rely on someone else.  Read Emerson's essay "Self Reliance.       Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it's too good to be true, it is.       Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a "whale" and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients..

Glassman        Risk avoidance is the name of the game.       Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get.         Penny stocks are highly speculative.  I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements.

I used to be a loan officer and my first advice would be to try to save some money for a down payment. Even 100% financing still involves fees. Could you be in better shape financially in a year or two? Paying all your bills on time for the next year will raise your credit score and that leads to a lower interest rate and possibly 100% financing. A lower interest rate means lower monthly payments. Instead of searching around and having all kinds of people pull your credit, I suggest you talk to a local mortgage company. They can get you pre-approved and let you know if you qualify for 100% financing. I can tell you though that if you don't have very good credit, 100% financing is very unlikely. Some people will promise you the moon and the stars, but as someone who's worked in that industry, I'm telling you the truth. If you want to talk further, message me.|`|rImeziSWaa	Definitely talk to a financial advisor don't try to do it on your own as you could end up with some dodgy mortgage deal!!!

JsPqEZsQaa	FIRST THING FIRST      Free Turns Out To Be Fraud.    That's what I have learned in 5 years of my work on online marketing and money generation. ASK ME WHY?    Cause no fool will ever let you know the real secrets without cutting a profit for him. When you come across free money making sites they are DAMN SLOW. You never make enough.Take it for granted I have tested at least half a dozen of them.You just let someone spam your email with ads and surveys. Do referral with the hope that someday you will see profit and what do you come across? You know it pretty well.    They will charge you because they will provide you with MATERIAL, MEANS AND METHODS of making some decent money to "SATISFACTION". They will provide you online support to your queries- which you never get in the free ones. This cost them maintenance. What you pay is simply nothing in comparison to what you will get in return.    I would suggest you to give it a try. What you pay is securely Refundable--NOTHING TO LOSE.     just check out and ask yourself, did you know this before!

h1m17rStaa	Jason is pretty much correct.  The structure is ageing.  Eventually would have to be replaced or repaired.    Depreciating the property on your taxes is one benefit of owning real estate, in that you can actually get cashflow on a property, and effectively increase that cashflow by using depreciation to offset more of the income.|`|3e1433c6f5c0370ada723f76b1277e25aa	When you buy real estate you are buying somethings that tend to lose value over time and other things that do not. In particular, depreciation is to cover the expected replacement of the items that will wear out or become economically obsolete over their effective life.    Depreciation is a way to recognize the possible decline in value based on historical information for that type of asset. If the paper loss from the depreciation is greater than the actual value in the future the tax code allows for recapture.    On a much more practical level investors like depreciation as it reduced the tax bill form current income (the rent). You can have positive cash flow and still show a loss on paper.|`|f385192642e9ea5c7d49ec56cd1b8e25aa	The building's value is most likely depreciating -    What is appreciating is the land underneath the building.|`|4813f606a5aca9c3582a546ad3542827aa	This is for taxes. You claim the depreciation to increase your retained earnings. You will have to pay the capital gains tax later when you sell the building if it is an investment property. The realtor definitely hit the nail on the head regarding the fact that the building is depreciating in value as where the land value has gone up.

AA11896477	Yes, assuming that 100 calls are offered at .10 (there could be fewer offered) you could buy 100 for $1000.    No, there is no way to know the price of the calls because WHEN the stock goes to 36 is really the vital piece of the puzzle.  If YHOO goes to 36 tomorrow then the calls might go to .50, if YHOO goes to 36 on the day of expiration then the calls will go even lower (no bid, offered at .05).    No, your options aren't worth $50,000.  You started with $1000, your options appreciated by 5X, so you end up with $5000.    How and when the stock rallies is what really matters here.  Option traders consider themselves more traders of volatility than anything else.  If you buy the calls and the stock is very volatile upward then you'll make money.  If the stock is not volatile, even if it goes up, you'll lose money.  This is expiration week for options so look at how cheap some options set to expire on Friday are now (don't be confused by those stocks that will announce earnings between now and expiration).|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	a) correct  b) no, It's based on supply and demand only.  c) yes, in theory you could.  ///

h1m17rStaa	Most mortgage loan products require you to have been receiving commissions for at least 1 year, generally 2.  So if you're now commission-only, you're SOL for a while.  If you have a base salary plus commissions, they'd only qualify you off your base salary.      There are some stated-income products that might work and be appropriate for a case like yours though.  These are very much credit score driven products, so your FICO scores will be a much bigger factor in what you're able to get, and at what rates.|`|AA11782466	You may have to use a niche program  but as long as you have the score still you may not have to worry about income....Send me an email with what you are looking to get done and I will be able to telll you fairly quickly which way i would suggest  866-6636894|`|WdOdOjpbaa	Jason,    When considering a mortgage, the "3 C's" are the deciding factors - Credit - Are you currently meeting your obligations?, Colateral - What are your current assets?, Capacity - Not only is income a consideration, but also your current debt.

Do your own homework - it's safer.  When you follow other people's advice (OPA) and it fails, what have you learned?  Zip.  Nada.  Zero.  OPA is for suckers.  Don't fall into that trap.       When you do your own homework even if it turns out to be wrong, you learn from it and get better - it's called experience.       Investing is like a scientific hypothesis - you hypothesize that based on your investigation and knowledge, this stock should go up and make a profit.  Sometimes your hypothesis is wrong and it's back to the drawing board.       If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/comme...       Don't be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web.         If you have lots of time before retirement  the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing and re-investing your proftis every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won't amount to much in 30 year owing to the the ravages of inflation.  But stocks are a good hedge against inflation.      By that time you may need a money manager  to manage your money - probably before when you reach the $500,000 mark.  Heck!  If you have achieved that much, you probably don't need a money manager - you are the best judge of where to invest your money by that time.      And that's the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death.       When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a "load", an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better.       Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%.       AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice.      You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates.       Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don't have to ask what stocks to invest in.         Be self reliant.         Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.       Find stocks that have steadily rising net profits (earnings), low debt, and good P/Es, lots of cash, companies buying back their stock..       What interests you?  Find stocks that pique your interest and passion.      You need fast growing good stocks with good earnings and in good sectors.  You need to learn more about the stock market before you even think about investing in it.      The stocks world is divided into 12 sectors such as energy which chevron belongs to.  It is next to last in the sectors list today.       Technology is numero uno, but things can change in a new york minute, but within the sector, the fastest growing are computer services, not Microsoft.  Then,  Electronic Instruments and controls.  Next is computer storage devices.       The next hot sector is Healthcare, but heed the warning below.  Go here for sectors:  (http://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/I...

First of all, stay away from "professional brokers" and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.   And tips at Yahoo! Answers.  And e-mail tips.  Do your own due diligence - don't rely on someone else.  Read Emerson's essay "Self Reliance.       Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it's too good to be true, it is.       Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a "whale" and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients..

Glassman        Risk avoidance is the name of the game.       Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get.         Penny stocks are highly speculative.  I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements.

You can do the same "red, yellow, green" color code with  an XL spread sheet, by down loading fundamental and techincal data from various websites.

THERE IS NO SUCH PROGRAM IN EXISTANCE.    You must do the research yourself and make informed decisions based on fundamentals and techincal analysis.    There are 8000+ stocks out there and your job is to filter these down to a managable level based on the criteria that you select. There's a multitude of stock trading books out there and if you research and think you will manage to pick stocks that will accelerate in price.    Good luck!

TradeStation and TCNet are two that come to mind.    Beware.  Remember infomercials are designed to do only one thing - sell product.  They usually do a good job of sounding like they're trying to help you, they've got the best deal anybody's ever heard of, they have a 'sure thing', etc.  But in reality what they're peddling is mostly hype.  (Not to say they're generally fraudulent, just that they are great at making a product sound like much more than it really is.)    Also, if you decide to get into trading stocks, you should realize that most people fail at it.  Reasons for this include that you are in the market trading with/against big-time professionals who do this full-time, have years of experience behind them, and have learned so much that would take you months and probably years to catch up with.    Also, trading involves commissions, so making a profit is more than just a matter of selling higher than buy price - you have to sell higher than buy price + entry commission + exit commission.    And generally you have to have a large sum of capital to invest to make the trading worth it - because traders are often just looking for pennies of increase.  This is out of necessity as generally a stock won't move that much in any given day.    If you still want to try it, read the fine print - you often have to execute a certain number of trades in a month or extra fees could apply.  You may want to start with imaginary trades to see how well you understand system and track whether you would have made or lost money.    But I think better choice would be to just find some quality stocks or mutual funds, put your money into them, and give them time (i.e. years) to generate a good return for you.

But... Did she borrow the money on her own? Really? Is it based on joint credit? Could she come back after you for half of the balance because it was a joint loan?    You math seems right, but divorce can be nasty. Make sure you have documented that the debt (and cash from it) was completely hers. Without that, you may be forced split the debt. It could also matter very much which state you are in. In some states it doesn't matter if she spent every dime. Just the fact that you are married means that you split everything 50/50.    Good Luck. (And as always, contact a CPA or attorney; the $200 bucks will be well spent when it comes to a $20,000 equity shift).

OeYY0kvbaa	A quitclaim works two ways:  to add a name to the deed  to delete a name to the deed.  It is very inexpensive to have your lawyer draw it up and take it to town.|`|h1m17rStaa	Yes, your ex-wife will have to sign a quit claim deed, or you can sometimes even record your divorce decree, though that's not recommended because it is public information then.  Some parts of it could be anyway through the courts, but at least it's not printed on the property records as well.    Until she signs this, or you provide the divorce decree, the title company has to ensure that any listed owners of the property have signed the refinance settlement statement and right to cancel.  The deed will permanently release her interest in the property, so you'll be able to refi or sell in the future without dealing with her ever again.      Just make sure your lender properly informs the title company of what to expect, so they can prepare the documents and make arrangements with the ex to have her sign it.  They'll record it for you as well, along with the new mortgage you take out.  They have to, to protect clear title on your refinance.  It shouldn't cost more than $50-75 in total for them to prepare and record it, including the county fees.
AA11923881	Predatory lending is the practice of a lender deceptively convincing borrowers to agree to unfair and abusive loan terms, or systematically violating those terms in ways that make it difficult for the borrower to defend against.  Although predatory lenders are most likely to target the less educated, racial minorities and the elderly, victims of predatory lending are represented across all demographics.    Predatory lending often occurs on loans backed by some kind of collateral, such as a car or house, so that if the borrower defaults on payment, or even if he doesn't default, the lender can repossess or foreclose and profit by selling the repossessed or foreclosed property. Other types of lending sometimes also referred to as predatory include payday loans, credit cards or other forms of consumer debt, and overdraft loans, when the interest rates are considered unreasonably high.    If you feel you have been a  victim of predatory lending you should visit the site below.    http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/pred/...|`|h1m17rStaa	There's no precise definition, it can vary based on many factors.  But usually it falls into a few categories:    1. High rates and fees charged (in excess of 5%-8% or more in fees/points, rates 5-10% over comparable US treasury bonds).  Definitions of "high-cost" loans vary by county, state, federal levels.    2. Refinancing repeatedly with ever-increasing loan amounts, with little or no tangible benefit to the borrower.    3. Lending with little expectation or confirmation through documentation that the borrower has a realistic possibility of repaying the loan.    4. Financing or requiring credit life/disability insurance, especially when financing a large upfront amount inside of the loan.    5. Some types of loans, especially in conjunction with "high-cost" loans, are more likely to increase the harm to the borrowers, such as negative amortization ( loan balance goes up every month), balloon payments (large amounts or amounts to pay off loan in full due within only a few years), and many other specific items.    If you feel you might be a victim, there's several places you can go for help.  Your state's housing finance agency.  State attorney general.  State department of real estate or commerce, whichever one regulates mortgage lenders.  ACORN.  HUD.
h1m17rStaa	Buy as low as possible.    Be realistic and cautious about the time and expense of rehabbing the property.    Sell as high as possible.    Hopefully, if you got it low enough, controlled your expenses, and were right about future expected market value, you'll make money.  Sometimes a lot.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes you might even lose.

7Ra7p7xjaa	It useually costs a lot to start a business unless you start small from your home and do not let the government know you even have a business. The government makes it impossible for small business to grow because there are too many regulations, licensses, fines, fees, taxes, ect. Wealthy from a business is a fairy tale most businesses do not make it past the first 5 years. If you even break even or turn a small profit you are very lucky. I would love to start a business, but it costs too much to setup and maintain. My both of my Grandfathers were able to start their own businesses. Both started small doing things the knew how to do. One grew from a gradge on a lake into a marina. But his wife was not good with finances and she squandered anything they did make. My other Grandfather started a machine repair shop out of his tool shed. It grew into one of the earliest electronics firms he made some of the first vacum tubes for the Voyager Probe. My father wanted to be independant and did not want to take over the company so it was sold and out-sourced to Tiawan somewhere. Nothing is left of it and sadly nothing of my grandfather is around anymore. Starting a business would have been easy in the fourties, but big government has seen to it that the little man stays down at any cost anymore.|`|53b84b469486987aeaf096711871f2ecaa	The best way to become wealthy is for someone to give you money without your having to work for it.

AA10274297	Yes, he should file taxes himself (probably can use form 1040EZ), but he cannot claim the personal exemption, because you will be claiming him as a dependent.    Depending on his income, he may owe taxes, but most likely his part-time job withheld enough taxes and he will receive a w-2 showing the amount withheld.  He will probably end up getting a refund.    Hope this helps!|`|tw44fqCpaa	If he made more than 5450 than he has to file.  If he made less he doesn't have to but if there is any withholding in box 2 of his W2 he should file to get it refunded.  Either way make sure he answers yes that he can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayers return on his 1040EZ form.
2yl8omcAaa	Sometimes the bank will send out to a multiple counter offer to all interested buyers that send offers other than you.     The house we are buying now is like that. we send the offer and we get counter offer with the bold mulitiple counter offer.     When we got the counter offer that day we send it back out. that day also, the bank signed ours. Do not know if everyone that send offers have the same amt or not.    So yeah, as long the bank hasnt signed the counter offer sent out they still have the right to consider another offer.|`|03e7189328d2be0ae2b7ccb88dad8bc6aa	It depends on whether your accepted counter offer was delivered to them before they accepted the other offer.  I'm guessing not.  In other words, if you sat at your dining table and signed it, that doesn't constitute acceptance by both parties until it's delivered to him.  Even if it's legal strictly speaking, it's pretty $hitty, and if I were you I would get my real estate agent involved and raise a stink about it if you're really in love with the house.  Sometimes there's not really much you can do even if you're wronged, you just have to walk away.  Sad but true, I bet if you surveyed 100 homeowners you'd run across 80 who had bad experiences like yours at one point or another.  Some people's values and ethics are sorely disappointing and nothing brings that out like a financial transaction.  But I would highly recommend you talk it over with your real estate agent.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Did the seller accept your acceptance of the counter offer and your deposit or earnest money?  If they got a better offer before you responded or they accepted that, they can accept any offer they want to.  Sometimes it depends not only on the dollar amount, but other factors, like how soon or how likely someone may be able to close.|`|uOer3OkMaa	Yes they can change their mind on the counter-offer. As long as, there wasn't any paper work signed on it. Sounds like you need to see a different realtor. He or She wasn't working for you. To bad :(  Good Luck. Try looking at this as a learning lesson. Be patient, You'll find that Perfect house :)|`|EsYfnOrkaa	It depends on your state laws, usually they cannot legally accept another offer after your acceptance of their counteroffer has been transmitted back to the seller properly. In Real Estate the law in most all states agree, that a written offer, counteroffer, etc. must be communicated to the agent or seller, before it is binding, therefor your agent would have to prove that they responded properly to the listing agent, prior to the sellers accepting another offer. You may need an attorney to sort this out.

Section 54.1-2915(A)(20) provides that the Board may refuse to issue a certificate or license to any applicant for a conviction in any state, territory, or country of any felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude (lying, cheating, stealing).    Your best bet would be to speak with someone in the licensure section of the Board of Medicine.  Their contact information is on their website.

I'm 25 and I haven't had any of those since I was a child, and I'm doing just fine (and I have poor vision; I just save up to pay cash each year when I need an exam and new contacts). It can be done, and will save you quite a bit of money.     Seriously watch your food spending. That is where my husband and I blow the most of our money without realizing it. Every cup of coffee or soda or snack, while it's only a few cents or dollars, adds up to a lot in the end. Track every cent you spend for just one month and you will realize how easy it is to spend money without really noticing.    Best of luck to you!

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!|`|cjfKUdbPaa	free online resume|`|aec914cfa6fb964721c8d7d76ac2c21caa	Use a Microsoft Word template.

K4WJYkk5aa	I don't know about pay-pal pay later, but I know of a easy way to help build credit.  You can go to a local furniture store or rent a center type place and buy a piece of furniture or some kind of electronics and pay on it.  That will build credit.  At least it used to.  I haven't had to worry about that in years.  There are also credit cards for people with bad or no credit.  The interest charges are big and the limits are low, but if you pay on time, it will build credit.  Good luck on it, just be careful.  Spend your credit wisely.  Don't over do it and you will have good credit to buy a house or a car.

AA10283296	Yes, you need to see an attorney.    BUT, as a business that is carrying debt, your personal credit has probably been used to secure the business debt.    So, when you file personal bankruptcy the business credit is going to be pulled too.      Maybe there is a way to only pull the business debt that is personally guaranteed, but bankruptcy law is a complex mess now.    Most attorneys offer free consultations, gather up all your info for business and personal and go and talk to one.    Know that you are not the only one in your situation.  Right now my S Corp is the opposite problem.  The bank is thinking about taking away a loan we have had and paid on for over 7 years (never missed a payment, never been late).  If that happens they will take our building loan too.  That will send us personally into bankruptcy and we will lose our house too.      And the government just keeps giving the banking thieves more money and letting them destroy our country.    Good luck to us all.|`|sB9xp8wraa	Your best bet is to consult with a bankruptcy attorney, which I am not, but I do believe that in the eyes of the law, you and your business are separate entities, so you should be able to declare personal bankruptcy and leave your business alone.

In many cases, if you break a lease, you will have to pay rent until they find another lessee.    Keep in mind that online reviews aren't necessarily giving you the whole truth. Usually people only write reviews if they were unsatisfied, and it could be that the majority of people there are satisfied. Also, there are some things about apartment life that suck but that you have to accept, such as loud neighbors or getting ripped off from your security deposit. And it's very possible that the management has changed since those reviews were written.|`|kyyEhr8Waa	nope. unless you wanna pay a big fee|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	No|`|JlbxqSM6aa	Contact a solicitor for an opinion, I know if your purchasing property you have a 24 hour cooling off period, this also may apply on a lease, but don't delay get to it pronto.|`|HGfUY3lbaa	yes you can  just tell them that you decided to move some where eles like out of state give them some fake story they problly wont care but you can get out of it and not have to live their but you wont be able to get your secrity deposit back. this acutual happend to me a month ago i told the lady i was moving in with my grandam to help her out and she said you cant have your deposit back read your contract on what you signed you could even take it to a lawer to look it over|`|moiMSUYYaa	Read the lease that you signed.

Only a qualified Lawyer in that state can tell you for sure, but in most cases a landlord will not hold you to a lease if you are determined to get out in very short notice after signing.     First read the lease. Second go back to the person you signed with and ask about getting out of the lease and what the procedure is. Third contact a local attorney with your lease in hand ASAP if they say no or they want more than your willing to pay. Whatever you do get it in writing from the person that signed the lease to begin with.    In most states, you can be held liable for the entire amount of the lease even if you do not live there, once you have signed a lease, just like you can be held for damages on a purchase contract, a court judge can reduce it to a smaller amount if they rent the place to someone else, otherwise they can take you to the cleaners, if they don't get it leased and you don't get a written release.

smy7GHkXaa	You are asking total strangers to give you advice about what you should do with your life?!  You can't be serious.  Nobody but you can answer that question.  That answer can only come from your own heart and mind.  What are your interests?  Is there anything that you are passionate about?  If you are wondering about any given field, contact someone--even a stranger--and ask them if you could either "shadow" them on the job for a day or two, and if not, then ask them if they would just let you interview them about what it's like to be in their position.    However, I can offer you one piece of advice that might, hopfully, help you: The ultimate goal of anyone is to be happy, and there's no better way to be happy than to help others.  Do some research and think about all of the "helping" professions, list them, think about each one, and, as stated above, see if you can really gain some first-hand knowledge about them.  Then, after a lot of thoughtful reflection, choose one of them.  Forget money.  If you have a college education, you will make enough money to live comfortably; anything beyond that isn't really important.  If it's money that you are placing at the top of your criteria for selecting a profession, then you aren't going to be happy, anyway, because you will have your goals in the wrong place.      You are only a freshman, so don't worry about not having chosen a major, yet.  Most college students change majors two or three times, during their four-year college "careers."  It would be wise to have a major chosen, by the time you are a junior, though, so you don't have to go an extra year, which, as you well know, is very expensive, these days.      Good luck to you.  It would be interesting to see what you finally chose.      --Ray  rayroshi@msn.com|`|b8LM28bVaa	Stick with it if you know that is what you want to be.

I myself am a Psychology major working on my Psy D but I've taken some criminal justice classes. I currently work as a mental health specialist with adolescents who are suicidal, bi-polar, severely depressed and things of that sort. It's a mental hospital. I really enjoy it though it can be rough at times because the kids can get violent and then we have to restrain them. But when they discharge and go back home to their families their so much better. I really love what I do because I feel I really make a difference in the kids lives. Basically we counsel them and get them ready to go back into the world.  Also you can work in Juvenile Hall or a group home. They also have mental hospitals for adults. You can be a probation officer...  There are many possibilities that I haven't mentioned, but I thought I'd give my insight on the area I have knowledge in. Hope this helps and good luck!!!!
Z88zNKkpaa	Probably you have some wrong items in your credit report. Use credit repair service to find and remove such bad stuff from your credit - creditreport.fateback.com|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I suggest you challenge this item dispute it is the term -in other words claim it is not correct.  The credit agency - trans union or who ever will have a specific form for this.     This requires the company to document the negative item and confirm the information in a certain time frame  that the negative item is correct or it will be removed.  I am guessing the new owner has no data on this and will not confirm it nor being an inactive account will it be worth their time to even look, hence it will go off your report.    Be sure to check all three credit reports because they differ.  I had one that showed the same account in good standing and delinquent at the same time. The other two just showed a negative report on that account.   I disputed it and it was removed from all three.  It is not hard and worth the small amount of time it takes.    Best wishes
HZvdr8VLaa	When your benefit year ends you have to reapply and requalify for benefits. You will draw benefits currently until your benefit amount runs out or your year ends. You benefits will run out before your year ends unless you take and lose jobs during the year. For example, you could take a temporary job, work it for 1 month and then restart your claim. If you worked some jobs during the year, your benefit year would end before your benefit balance ran out.
AA10283296	The extensions are only good for the states where unemployment rate exceeds the national average.

Also, have you checked on line at your state unemployment website.  It may have a clearer explanation of the UC extension.     I know in Ohio you just call the special phone number they have on the website for new claims and there is an option for the UC extension. Then you get a real live person who takes your ss  and looks up your information and processes the extension if you are eligible.  The office has extended their hours and is open on Saturday too.  I find if I call first thing in the morning or on Saturday I usually get through right away.
HV917FHVaa	Its a very good question but hard to answer accurately. I am sharing what I know - As LIC put most of its money in debt market (less in equity) so the return is not that good. Anyway a rough breakup for different kind of policies are as as given below -    1. Endowment - around 11%  2. ULIP - around 13% to 15%  3. Traditional - around 6 to 7%    Again you get risk cover (minimum in endowment and maximum in ULIP). So any policy that you take must a combination i.e package keeping investment/risk cover/ tax return/payer benefit etc in mind.

AA10274297	I think they are guilty of consumer fraud, and you might be able to go after them for the shipping charges and the repo fees, but it will probably be hard to get the compensatory damages for the contracts that you lost as a result of not having the truck.  I listen to Bill Handel's "Handel on the Law" radio program, and he says that you can't get a lawyer interested unless there is a lot of money to be had for the least effort.  So your best bet would be to try small claims court to get back the $2180.    Handel has a website (see below) that lets you search for lawyers, but I don't know if it has affiliates in Hawaii.  Nevertheless, it is worth checking out because it will give some advice on how to do small claims court.    BBB won't do anything except take your report.  If somebody asks them about GMAC before doing business with them, they will show them your report.  Unfortunately, nobody ever thinks to check with the BBB BEFORE dealing with a business.  I would think GMAC would be more ethical than they have been with you, but I guess not.    Good luck!|`|OiUxoqcPaa	You don't have a case.  No lawyer is going to take this one.

Be sure that you tell your financial advisor (or bank) what you are going to do with the money.  The reason that this is a good option is because the interest equity loans is tax deductible, just like interest on your mortgage.  If you take out a new loan to buy a business, that interest is not tax deductible.  Take the equity out of the house that is your primary residence and you can deduct all the interest you pay on the loan.|`|h1m17rStaa	Find a banker locally to work with.

AA10287830	I would suggest banking or some kind of finance.  You can work in the trust department of a bank.  Banks still have wonderful hours and good benefits.  You might be bought out a few times but if you have a secure position you will be grandfathered in with each purchase.  And who knows, maybe you won't be bought out.  Wells Fargo just purchased Wachovia so they are settled.  It really  is worth looking into.
1Fg7Tybvaa	First off, I want to thank you for serving our Country    Is the $2500 take home pay include BAQ and separate Rations  or would you get extra for that, also does your payment  include Principal, interest, taxes and insurance? if it does  not include the taxes and insurance then those are expenses  that need to be planned for, fortunately the insurance is  an annual expense and your taxes can be either annual or  semi-annual depending upon where you live (I know it is not  California, $200,000 is way to cheap)    One way to increase your income is to take all of your  expected deductions such as the interest, taxes, insurance  and add these up (these are items that you would expect  to put on schedule A of your federal tax return), at the  moment you can claim 3 exemptions and soon 4 but after  you add up all of you expected exemptions take that total  and divide it by $2,000 the resulting number is the   number of additional exepmtions that you can claim  on your W-4 form.    This would result in you paying less federal tax and the  difference would be in your pocket. The other good thing  is that when a person rents, he pays his rent in advance  when you purchase you pay in arrears so you will live in  your new home with out making a payment the first month.    Split your mortage cost over 2 pay checks, as long as  you will not have to pay rent nor a mortage payment you  can set aside $750 from each pay check, I have done  this (though weekly) when I worked for myself.    I know that putting up $750 each payday only leaves you  $500 to live on but if you can get your budget right you  can use this for all of your bills.  As you gain rank your salary will increase making it easier  to make the payment or perhaps you will re-enter civilian  life and get a job that pays better.    If this really makes you nervous look at homes that would  have a significantly lower payment.    Congratulations on the new baby, and God Bless you  and keep you safe.|`|h1m17rStaa	I think you need to question the financing.  Something is wrong here.    $150,000 at 6% (no reason you shouldn't get a rate in the low 6's) is only $899/mo.  Even if you're at 6.5% because you need a 6-9 month rate lock, you're still only at $948/mo.    I don't know what taxes and insurance are, but they're sure as heck not $550-600/mo.  No way.  The highest amount I could imagine for a property worth $200K is maybe $4000/year, $333/mo.      So, where the heck is the other money going????  Are you at a 10% rate or something?    A $200K home, with a $150K mortgage, shouldn't cost you more than $1100-1200.  With a net income of $2500, that should be managable.    I don't care if they pay closing costs, and take $5000 off the purchase price.  There's no reason you should be abused on the interest rate.  VA loans are very forgiving on credit, especially with a $50K downpayment.  So, you shouldn't have to pay more than 6.5% on a VA 30 year fixed rate loan right now.    Keep looking.  You're on track, this isn't the right deal though.|`|AA10359640	i am also buying a home with 2 children adn only one income.. ask the lender what DTI they are allowing and what loan program they are using... from what my lender has said, most programs wont allow for anything more then 46% debt to income ratio. sooo if the house payment alone is more then 50% something is off. go to creditboards.com and click forums and join and searcht he mortgage forum ive learned alot on there|`|e476f5a39881ba7497f8df47a14f9dcbaa	Yes, that is too much for your income.

Figure out your car payment, insurance, gasoline, repair bills, expected utility bills, food, and medical co-payments then don't forget baby food (formula), diapers, daycare (possibly), clothes (your kids will outgrow them as soon as you buy them).  And finally, if you haven't owned a home before, there is always an "extra" expense.    Find a cheaper house that will suit your family better.

Also, I would encourage you to not just put down "volunteer" for the title of the job.  Instead, think of what it would have been titled if it had been paid.  For example:  "Nurse Aide - Volunteer" or "Medical Assistant Externship".    If you need descriptions of what you did go to http://online.onetcenter.org/    Hope this helps!|`|uoCq9B7yaa	They sure can.  I put them on my resume and got the job.|`|gkfXTpiqaa	i think you can hunt good job,  if i am HR,i will appreciate your experience in volunteered group..|`|vUiUoamVaa	It should be, no matter what type of position you are applying for.  Employers like to know that sort of stuff.  It shows initiative, community service and so forth = they like that.
jyDmUbYzaa	Hello,  The fact that online money transfer has simplified our lives largely cannot be denied at all. When online money transfer first came into light, it eliminated the need to make cheques and send it to another part of the world through postal services, couriers, etc. On the contrary, users were allowed to perform online money transfer worldwide directly from their bank accountsthat too without having to visit the bank personally.    The best part about money transfer worldwide is that recipient gets the money in a matter of minutes irrespective of the destination. No matter how remote the place where your friends or relatives are, or your beneficiaries are, you can send him his due in a matter of minutes. Most importantly, you need not even have a bank account to be able to transfer money online. A few online money transfer service providers have developed innovative ways to transfer money worldwide. You can simply register in their website, create an account instantly, charge your account with some money, and send the money to the beneficiary. Your beneficiary needs not have an account to access the money. The provider will take care of it.|`|OBA3Iciraa	you should be able to do an ACH, an automated clearing house.  You will need the routing numbers off of both checks.  These are located at the bottom of the check and it's the first set of numbers, these are the routing numbers.  The next set of numbers are the account number of your checking account.  You will need those too.  Wire transfers will cost you.  an ACH might be free.  good luck.  Cant you just write a check out to yourself and send it to the other bank? or do you need it faster?|`|liDPeZkKaa	hi dear   if you are looking for a oppurtunity to make money online without paying for anything and also keep your self protected or safe loosing money from the scammers    then have a reliable souce of source of your question   there are actually may tpea of resources of making money without investment    i suggest you to please visit the for your kind information

32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I worked at 3 different banks in the past. You won't move into a loan officer/branch management position without a banking or finance degree. You could move into a back office department management kind of position eventually, but that would be about it. However, many of them will pay for continuing education if you wanted to go back to school and pursue a degree more suited to banking.     Tellers don't make that much. Over the years I spent in banking, I was a teller, head teller, CSR (new accounts/secretarial), and worked several back office positions in the loan department of a large bank. The work was always easy to me, but honestly, I wouldn't go back because the pay just isn't good enough. If you are not concerned with that, the hours are great and the benefits are decent.|`|AA11840302	it depends on how good you are.

DorePwVOaa	http://www.annualcreditreport.com    It's the site run by the government that lets you get one free credit report each year from each of the three credit reporting agencies. Good luck!|`|AA10274297	Stephanie C and prettybutrfly126 are correct; annualcreditreport.com is the official, no strings attached, site.    As you go through the process, they will offer you the chance to pay for your FICO score or for credit monitoring services, but just say "no thanks" and continue.  You will get your full credit report for no charge.  Before you go to the sites, make sure your printer has ink and paper, because you will want to print a hardcopy.    Since you can only get one free report per credit agency per year, a good strategy is to get one from the first agency, wait 4 months and get it from the second agency, then wait 4 months and get it from the third, then wait 4 months and go back to the first one, etc.  That way you are covered year around.|`|p2TCIUfRaa	How about freecreditreport.com|`|4CO4fowjaa	yes if you use this website you can get 1 free from each reporting company a year. I usually get one in the beginning of the year, one in the middle and one at the end of the year.    Click on this link and choose your state. Fill in all info and then it will take you to the 3 reporting agency's Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.. Choose whichever one you want your report from. Be careful to choose your answers carefully and correctly otherwise it will not give you the report. It will tell you that you need to mail for it. If this does happen, go through the link again and choose a different agency and try again. Good luck.
oHUDTX7aaa	The IRS does not guarantee a specific deposit date, although it's generally according to the schedule you've seen. Many refunds have been delayed due to errors related to the recovery rebate credit. I also suspect the large volume of efiled returns could be the problem as well,    By the way, direct deposits are usually made a couple of days before the day it shows up in the bank. This is because for Friday deposits the banks are obligated by the IRS to make it available on that day.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	For those you efile up to Jan 22, direct deposit will be sent on Jan 30; it will reach bank on Feb 3. Paper check will be sent on Feb 6 and it will take 3 or 4 days more for you to get the check    If you filed between Jan 22 to 29, direct deposit will be sent on Feb 6 and paper check on Feb 13.     If you filed between Jan 29 to Feb 5, direct deposit will be sent on Feb 13 and paper check on Feb 20.   For more information, and how to find status of your refund, read http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2009/01/when...|`|679b8d7cf6af09651cb0baaaeea3ff0aaa	Unfortunately, it's a hit or miss situation. I know a lot of people say that there is a hard fast schedule for when you'll receive your refund, based on when you file, and when it hits your bank, but its different for everyone. I was lucky this year. After filing on the 15th, my DD was there Friday morning 1/30! Last year wasnt so lucky, and i seem to be hearing from a lot of people that they're getting stuck in delays as well. I do know that if you filed for the stimulus rebate, it could slow things up by a few weeks. And if the IRS is still processing, then perhaps it simply has something to do with how you filed.... dependants, and what not. The more complicated your return is, the longer it will obviously take for it to be processed. It sucks because in this economy, people need their refunds NOW! Good luck to you, and try not to pull your hair out!
AA11284831	It will be on your W-2.  You can't file without it so just be patient.
4gMdp2nwaa	If the car makers do survived this current turmoil there is a good chance that they will move up significantly. However, in my opinion the chance that they will go bankrupt or need severe government help is the reason that they are priced so low. On top of surviving the financial crisis they have to be able to pay their high employee pension costs which will stop them from being profitable for a long time to come.    If you don't mind taking a chance that you will lose the money invested in these stocks and take a gamble for the long term then go ahead and buy them. I wouldn't at this point in time though.|`|AA10283296	They are going to fail and eventually the government is going to run out of tricks to keep the country going--they are nearly there now as no matter how much money they spend it just keeps getting worse.    I bought Ford last fall for $4, then when it hit $5 (which was like a day) I sold and pocketed a cool $500 (before tax).      No WAY would I invest in them now.  Once they fall below $1 a share you won't even be able to sell and once they file bankruptcy, it is over for the stock.    Your dad, like most Americans, needs to quit listening to the experts and politicians since they are the same people that got us in this mess.  The market is not at bottom, I fully expect that we will drop to less than 6000 before this disaster plays out.  If not worse.    For now, and probably for a while, cash is what you should be investing in.  Most people think that during the Great Depression stocks were at their lowest directly following the crash in '29, they weren't.  They actually rebounded after then before hitting record lows in '31, '32 and '33.  Research this and see the truth.  The worst is yet to come.    Good luck|`|vM2o0Nicaa	id say no, its to risky right now with the economy|`|0b5OTYbeaa	Yes.  If you are thinking about putting money into american automobile companies you have to make the commitment first and forehand that this WILL be a long-term investment. GM and Ford are undergoing an overhaul, and President Obama just declined one of Bush's aid packages for them and increased the standards set for the vehicles. What this means is that more hybrids are going to be coming out in about 2012, but the prices will be sky high to make up for the increased engineering on the vehicles and high gas-mileage standards in the bill. The turnaround will come around because they are being backed up by the American government you just have to be willing and patient with your stock because it may fluctuate.|`|Y8TS6Do0aa	The US can, in fact, allow them to fail, but won't. If you have a lot of money lying around and don't need an immediate (or even remotely soon) return, then maybe, MAYBE invest. But don't expect to make a lot of money. Unless they change how they do business, they're going to be as unprofitable in the future as they are now.    I'd rather invest in a foreign car company that's taking a beating right now than an American company.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	I bought ford at $10 thinking it couldn't get lower.   If you are going to use money you would have spent at a casino.  Are there any cars made in the US not made by foreign companies? Maybe it is Toyota who make cars in the US who can't fail :-)  It currently is high risk so if you can afford to loose the money spin the wheel.  If they go though bankruptcy the company may survive but not the stocks.|`|VWILDaYPaa	maybe gm but not chrysler ther most likley going to merge with someone else.its going to be a long slow climb though
Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    It is hard to tell if you will get a refund or not without knowing how much was withheld for federal taxes.    For a dependent, the taxes on $7,000 will be about $156.  Find your withholding amount on your W-2.  Take that figure and subtract $156 from it.  That is the amount of your refund.    Also,  the tax law states that if you are under 19, a full-time student for at least some part of five months of the year and living at home, your parents are the only ones who can claim you.  Even if they choose to not list you on their return, you cannot claim your own personal exemption.  You have to file as being a dependent of another taxpayer.  So, yes, your parents will claim you.    And, if you continue to go to school, are under 24 and a full time student for at least some part of five months of the year, you will still be a dependent, even if you live at college.    Hope this helps.

Now see what is your federal tax withheld to figure out your refund.    Even if you are a dependent, you must file your tax return if your income exceeds the filing requirements. Also even if you are not required to file and have a refund, you should file to get the refund.     If someone can claim you dependent, then you can not claim your own exemption.   Read about the filing requirements of a dependent: http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/02/fili...|`|1x6BJkOjaa	Possibly, if you had money deducted from your income during the year.    If you can claim yourself as an exemption and with the standard deduction, you shouldn't owe any taxes, and will get anything you paid in.    However, If your parents claims you as an exemption you might get back some of what you paid in for taxes.   It depends  if what you paid in is over the amount of taxes owed on your adjusted gross income after certain allowable deductions .|`|K7x1RHVFaa	You get anything over 154 in federal taxes paid. I looked it up in the tax table for you.    Good Luck.

JxpT4PlZaa	New Zealand credit card interest rates sound atrocious:    [Quote]  Banks are under pressure to cut the interest rates on credit cards, with a Sunday Star-Times investigation revealing the charges have not dropped in line with the banks' rapidly falling costs.    The declining official cash rate (OCR) means it costs banks half what it did a year ago to provide credit card debt but most still charge 21 percent interest or more on their standard credit cards, potentially earning tens of millions in extra interest payments.

7I46vTrbaa	This scam is also known as 419 fraud, the Nigerian connection, the advanced fee fraud and 419.  It's been around since the 1980's and is now flourishing in cyber space.    The letters are heart wrenching, they bring tears to your eyes, they are SCAMS!   While the sender appears to be reaching out for our help, they are in fact counting on our greed to suck us in.   Do not respond to them!  Delete them!      Police departments are warning local businesses, and advising strongly against responding in any way.  Special task forces exist to fight this international crime.     The way the scam works is, the victim is lured in to responding.  Once the correspondence begins, suddenly small complications arise.  Perhaps an unexpected tax needs to be paid, an advance fee is required or maybe a bribe of a government official is necessary. Of course their cash is tied up so guess where the money comes from to cover this? You guessed it, the victim.    The amounts they ask for appear small compared to the financial gains at stake.  Before the victim knows it, they have been bilked of their life savings.    Many victims are too embarrassed to even report that they have been scammed.  The estimates for loss by victims is in the billions.    The best thing we can do, is spread awareness.  Please help by informing your friends and family about this scam.|`|fYUgURZmaa	Dolphin Estates exist in Lagos, but they are NOT in Ikeja but in Ikoyi.

FwTKWcC4aa	Yeah, I would have to agree that blogging is a great way to optimize.  To be 100% honest with you, I find that creating a blog is just easier  to get ranked for the keywords I've chosen, so I really stick to only doing blogs.      The one thing I can say, is if you want to get more traffic to your site, make sure you point your blogs to your main page, but also do some other promotion of the main pages, such as doing a squidoo lens that points to your page, doing some hub pages, writing articles, all with relevant anchor text.  The more backlinks you have pointing to your main site, the better it will rank.    I hope this helps!|`|LUoZC3ycaa	Many companies are realising the benefits of blogging and the reason they are so popular is simply because they are regularly up dated and you can create hundreds of keyword rich phrases.

EsYfnOrkaa	Really you are not in as much trouble as your Broker or Manager. They should have trained you before you were allowed out with a lock-box key.    Yes, the tenant can sue, but so can I just because you told me about it. doesn't mean either one of us will get anything, anyone can sue for any reason any time some lawyer will take the case, until judge throws it out of court.    There are rules and regs that the MLS has as to what the penalty if any is for you trying to show a home without notice, and your Broker can hold you responsible for any fines. You owe the listing agent, and tenant a written apology (send the tenant's through the listing agent not directly to the tenant).|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I'd be asking your boss this question.

Calculating a debt-to-income ratio will give you a good idea of how much of your income will be available for monthly mortgage payments, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, collectively referred to as "PITI."     Many experts agree that PITI, the total amount you pay toward your mortgage, should not exceed 28 percent of your gross income. The total amount you pay in debt-related expenses, including your mortgage, car loan payments, credit card bills, student loan payments, and any other debts, should not exceed 36 percent of your income.     So how much can you afford to pay each month? The first step is to determine your total income. This includes not only your regular salary but also the following:     Bonuses   Regular income from dividends and interest   Assistance or support payments, such as alimony or child support   Payment from tips or commissions   The total of all these figures will give you your gross annual income; dividing by 12 will yield your monthly gross income. Multiplying your monthly income by .28 will give you an idea of how much you can afford in monthly mortgage payments.     For example, if your total household income is $80,000, your monthly income is $6,667. At 28 percent, you can afford to spend $1,867 on your mortgage per month. At 36 percent you would have a total of $2,400 in debt-related expenses per month.     At this point you are ready to consider your loan options and use online calculators to see where you stand. Continuing with the previous example, if you find a mortgage loan with a monthly payment of $1,500, you would be well under your $1,867 limit. Next, factor in your average monthly credit card expenses, car payments, and any other rotating charges. If that total comes to $800, your total debt burden would be roughly $2,300, $100 less than your $2,400 limit.     Ultimately it is up to you to apply these formulas and ratios to your own financial situation. Remember, while the numbers may help you get approved for a loan, they wont provide you with the whole story. Some people can afford a little more, while others should pay less, depending on lifestyles and other factors.

0EtjfzRsaa	I would like more information on this TILA issue.  I had approached a dozen lawyers in my area 2 years ago when the whole process of my foreclosure started.  I was told in every instance that while I was without question a victim of Predatory Lending that since the state of Ohio had no law against it (they do now but it is too late to apply to my situation) that there was nothing that could be done.  With regard to the interest rate issue (which is explained later) no one wanted to touch it with a 10 foot pole to take on the mortgage company, when I would tell lawyers who my mortgage company was they wanted no part of it and would only say they are known for this exact type of action and are impossible to deal with on any level and told me more or less to have a nice day.     We have been in our home since 1994 and opted to refinance in November of 2003.  At closing, which took place in our living room, we were informed of the interest rate being fixed for 2 years and our payment was $1180.  We were also aware that our interest rate would adjust after that time but we were told that it was based off of the current Federal interest rate that time and we were told that the interest rate could go either up or down based on that, but we were assured that with how low the federal interest rates were that while they could go up that it was unlikely.    While we did make the HUGE mistake in not having a lawyer at closing, since we had taken out a 2nd mortgage previously in 1999 in addition to when we initially bought the house in 1994 and never used a lawyer we didn't think we would need one then either because we figured there were laws that would protect us from anything shady, boy have we learned differently!  Once we got the first payment with the adjustable rate having kicked in the payment went from $1180 to $1570....in 13 months time the payment was up to $2400!  We tried to refinance as soon as we received the first adjustable mortgage payment but were unable to since I had since become self employed and hadn't been self employed for long enough at that time even though I had no lapse in employment from a traditional employer to being self employed and had a higher income than I did when I worked for a traditional employer (2 years self employed and all the lenders we spoke with wanted to see at least 5 years) for anyone to be willing to consider us regardless to my husband's employment as a teacher and coach for several years.    Mind you when we did this refinance we were by no means high risk or had bad credit.  We went from a Prime mortgage and a 2nd mortgage which was also prime to a subprime mortgage which initially for the 2 years it was fixed gave us lower payments than the 2 other payments we had combined before.  We had no idea that we were being lumped into a subprime group and our credit and job history at that time would not have qualified us as subprime either as we had no previous late payments in over 5 years (we had a couple late credit card payments of 30 days once in 1997).  We were told by the mortgage broker that it was the best we could qualify for after she claimed to have sent our information to over 20 different lenders, and since the payment was lower we thought we were getting a better deal.    Since then, after a year of trying to keep up with the outrageously high mortgage payments, we made the determination that it just wasn't worth it anymore as trying to keep up with the mortgage payment which more than doubled in 13 months time we were falling behind on other bills and we made the decision that this house just simply wasn't worth $2400 a month (we had a 135K mortgage), so we let the bank foreclose.      Since the foreclosure papers were first served in February of 2007 we still received notices from the bank of what our new payment was with the new interest rate adjustment which went as high as $3,000 per month, nearly triple our original payment.    What we learned about our refinance just before we let the house go into foreclosure when we first sought out a lawyer to look everything over with our original mortgage papers with them and all 3 years of statements we had received from them was that when the interest rate first adjusted was that the interest rate was GUARANTEED to go up from the rate we received the 2 years it was fixed by 1% every 6 months INDEFINITELY until it reached the cap interest rate of 16.9%!  With of course a bonus of an extra 1% with the first initial adjustment.  The interest rate had absolutely nothing to do with the current Federal interest rate what so ever as we were told at closing.  The interest rate was supposed to be capped to never exceed 16.9% and in December of 2006 when we receive the notice that the new payment starting in January of 2007 was going to jump to $2400 I called the mortgage company to see if anything could be worked out and they offered no help at all, it was pay it or get out sort of attitude, and at this point the mortg|`|gP4OizWxaa	Mortgage Litigation Under the Federal Truth In Lending Act    In many cases, it is possible for a borrower in foreclosure to keep possession of their property without making mortgage payments for a period of time due to violations of Federal Law by the mortgage company.     The Truth In Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) are violated daily by lenders and mortgage companies. These loss mitigation laws are in place to protect you, the homeowner, but they are often completely disregarded. Your loan is probably unlawful, and you may be entitled to substantial damages whether or not you're currently in foreclosure.     Not only can the Truth In Lending Act be used to immediately stop the foreclosure process (if you currently are in foreclosure), but it also lets you avoid bankruptcy and it puts money in your pocket. Once TILA and/or RESPA violations are discovered in your loan documents, your lender will be eager to discontinue the unlawful foreclosure process and settle the dispute.     Most loans (especially those in foreclosure) will qualify for our program, but time is critical. We need time to fully analyze and evaluate your mortgage documents and then prepare the lawsuit. Here is an overview of how our program works:     We scrutinize the mortgage documents you received upon the closing of your loans(s) and look for TILA, RESPA and/or HOEPA violations by your lender. Nearly every loan has at least some violations.   We immediately file a Federal lawsuit on your behalf, and place a Lis Pendens on the property to stop foreclosure (if applicable) and begin litigating your causes of action against the lender(s).     We reach a settlement agreement with the lender (most cases) or continue on to trial (rare situations) and demonstrate to a judge or jury how the lender has willfully failed to comply with Federal Law.     It is NOT necessary for you to make mortgage payments while the lawsuit is pending.     It is also unlawful for the lender to report negative information about you to the Credit Reporting Agencies while the lawsuit is pending under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.   Our program is also affordable, we represent you on a hybrid contingency arrangement to keep out-of-pocket costs low.

4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	There are several ways to structure a draw...    In the beginning, you may have a "non-recoverable" draw, which means the company cannot re-coup the draw they give you.  That is the same as a salary.  Most of the time, though, you will have very little chance at commission or extra earnings during this time due to the company needing to re-coup their investment in you and you probably not making many sales due to ramping up in the business.    Next, you have a "recoverable draw" - let's say that you get $2000 draw for the month.  You don't sell anything for three months.  Well, the company has "loaned" you $6000 to live during that time.  The draw will come out of your next commission check.  If it's a $10,000 check, your net will be $4000 due to them having to "recover" the $6000 that they paid you up front.    The example you gave is a variation of a recoverable draw.    My advice is that if you have a position that relies heavily on commission, then I'd get off the draw as soon as it's feasible.  This way, you keep all that you earn and don't go into the hole when you have a sales hiccup.  Tough to budget that way, but at least you don't get into a situation where you "owe" your boss any money.
h1m17rStaa	Always try conventional financing first.  FHA will always charge an upfront mortgage insurance premium that could be avoided with conventional financing.    With a 20% downpayment, there's a good chance that you can qualify for conventional financing, even with weak credit.    FHA loans MUST be run through the FHA underwriting system first under every circumstance.  Once that's been done, it's a 5-minute change process to convert it to conventional, and costs nothing extra.  And you can start conventional and convert to FHA as well, same deal.    FHA loans pay brokers more than comparable conventional loans, in most cases.  That's one factor that might be in play here.  FHA is very lenient on credit, so that isn't a bad choice either, if that's what you can get.  Any FHA rate offered in excess of 6.5% means you need to find a new, non-greedy broker.

The moment he received the seller's listing, he should have begun the process of working the short sale.  He should have submitted the short sale package and begun negotiations on the price with the lender.  There's really nobody to complain to in this situation.  If you're going to try to buy distressed property, you're going to run into this a lot.  Many realtors don't have much interest in short sale properties and don't bother to do the legwork until they receive an offer.

Ive represented buyers in short sales before (doing another at this moment) and the MLS price is normally the price.  If someone bids higher, you might not get it but I have not heard of the bank coming back for more money except for one situation.    I have (rarely) found that the seller did not talk to the bank BEFORE offering the property as a short sale.  Then, when the seller accepted the offer and submitted it to the bank for approval, they did not agree with the price.  If this is the case, then the agent representing the seller did not do their job.  The agent representing the seller should have contacted the bank (or mortgage companies) and had preliminary approval, in writing, from the bank BEFORE listing the property as a short sale.      Before I write a contract on a home with a short sale, I call the listing agent and verify that they have written pre-approval from the bank.

It's completely unacceptable to list a property for $200,000, receive a full price offer, and counteroffer with $35,000 more.  Perhaps that's ok with multiple offers, but they should just take a higher offer made to them, not counter back for more from you.  I'd be PO'd too if I were you and your agent.

They were probably crooked when issuing the loan that went bad, so don't expect them to act normal now.
b79fbff1113ba0e72cfe977bbb709008aa	There really is no such thing.  They dont give you the cheapest interest rate that you qualify for.  So either way you are still paying for it, just nothing is comming out of your pocket at the time.|`|h1m17rStaa	You're absolutely right.  Banks do nothing for free.    Any time you have a reduction in fees from your lender, they must compensate themselves through a higher interest rate.    Usually, in my opinion, it makes the most sense to pay the actual costs associated with the loan directly, and take the lowest rate possible.  However, much depends on how long you'll be in that home, or even in that loan.  Anything less than 3 years, it might make sense to take the higher rate and lower fees, as the higher rate will cost far more over 30 years, but less in the early years.    The only way to compare is to take a look at what rates you are offered, and what fees you are saving.  If you save $1000 in fees, but pay another $20/month in interest, it will take you 50 months before your higher rate actually costs you more.  So, if you're out of that home or loan within that time frame, you saved money.  If you're in that same loan 8 years from now, you've now lost $920 in higher interest payments.    A good loan officer should be happy to present your options both ways (clearly showing the break-even periods required), and make recommendations based on your best estimate of how long you'll be in that home or in that loan.|`|otlCqsl8aa	The true name should be zero money needed at closing. Do you REALLY think that a bank that charges you for ATM transactions will eat the cost of closing your loan? The appraiser, title company, county recorder dont work for the bank. What bank stays in business by giving away money? Aren't there certain accounts that CHARGE you YOUR money based on the amount you keep?     The place to see what you paid for is line 803. The yield spread premium is what you PAID to NOT recieve the lowest rate!|`|TlGxPDxiaa	All of this is true but one thing. Line 803 does not exist for more banks only brokers!!!!! YSP or Deferred premium does not have to be disclosed by banks or true lenders! If there is no fees associated with your loan go to the truth in lending or the truth in confusing, it will show you the cost of your loan if  your rate is 6.00% and your APR is 6.45% you are paying the closing costs not the bank.

Another good one to have in your bag of tricks is, OTO, or "one triggers the other".    For an OCO order, say you want to buy stock A or B.  You place an OCO limit order and which ever fills first, the other cancels.    For an OTO order, say you want to buy stock A, but only if the DOW goes avbove 13000.

J0bqxozSaa	Dear Friend,           First and foremost ... YES WOMEN DRIVE (AND VOTE)! now that I got that off my chest, I could answer the rest of your questions!     Camp Doha    Camp Doha is a warehouse complex north of Kuwait City which has been a major US base since the Gulf War. The Army uses Camp Doha, a former industrial warehouse complex converted to an Army installation after Kuwait's liberation from Iraq. Army Forces Central Command-Kuwait (ARCENT-Kuwait), headquartered at Camp Doha, is responsible for RSOI and administrative support of Army forces deploying to Kuwait, oversight of the contract that maintains the brigade prepositioned fleet, and installation support for Camp Doha. Coalition/Joint Task Force-Kuwait (Forward) (C/JTF-KU (Fwd)) is also based on Camp Doha. Established during Operation DESERT THUNDER I and continuously manned since February 1998, C/JTF-KU (Fwd) provides a forward command and control headquarters capable of rapid expansion to execute joint, combined, and coalition combat operations and maintains area situational awareness by daily coordination with the Air Force and Navy Joint Task Forces in Saudi Arabia and Baharain, respectively. C/JTF-KU (Fwd) also has tactical control of all Army forces deployed in Kuwait and US Marine forces when ashore in Kuwait.    On January 21, 2003 an American civilian was killed and another wounded in an ambush near Kuwait City. The two American men were civilian contractors working for the U-S military in Kuwait, according to a U-S embassy spokesman (John Moran) in the emirate.    The shooting occurred about nine o'clock in the morning, local time, just north of Kuwait City, at an intersection several kilometers from Camp Doha, where as many as ten thousand U-S troops are stationed to prepare for a possible attack on neighboring Iraq.    The two men were in a Toyota Landcruiser that was struck several times by gunfire. The driver was shot in the shoulder and the leg and is said to be in stable condition at a local hospital. His passenger was shot several times and died as a result of his wounds.    Authorities say it appears the gunman or gunmen may have been laying in wait in a nearby agricultural area, and ambushed the car as it was driving by. No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting. A manhunt is underway.    The ARCENT-KU presence in Kuwait remains a deterrent to aggression and helps preserve peace in the region. ARCENT-KU serves as the forward-deployed base for Joint Task Force-Kuwait (JTF-Kuwait), providing command and control over all US Forces that deploy into Kuwait during a contingency.    US ARCENTKU maintains a forward presence and exercises command control and force protection over assigned and attached Army forces in Kuwait. Its headquarters is located at Camp Doha, KU. Camp Doha, Kuwait, is a large logistics base located 20 miles west of Kuwait City that serves as the Army's forward presence in the Middle East. As of 2000 Camp Doha had a working population of over 2,000 personnel including US military personnel, as well as US, Kuwaiti, and third-country national contractor personnel.    ARCENT-KU also provides mission support to other US forces and agencies in the area of responsibility (AOR). The Directorate of Logistics (DOL) is the executive agent for all logistical actions, to include conducting reception, staging, onward movement and integration (RSOI) of units deploying to Kuwait.    ARCENT (Fwd) staff runs Camp Doha and has OPCON of forces; provides administrative and logistics support; commander is on 2 year tour, remaining staff on 1 year tours. A US Army Battalion rotates every 4 months, with a differing mix of mechanized/armor. CJTF-K provides tactical control of forces; established by 3d Army in February 1988, includes United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Combat Support Associates (CSA) has the support contract for Camp Doha, to include supply, maintenance of prepositioned equipment, force on force training, range control and camp security; 546 US and 787 Third Country National contract personnel. CSA maintains equipment for 7 battalions, plus a division slice.    The ADA Task Force maintains and services prepositioned sets of equipment stored at Camp Doha for contingency operations. Then the units deploy to join the equipment for defense of critical assets in Kuwait against theater ballistic missile threats using the PATRIOT missile systems. The main function here is the maintenance of the equipment sets to ensure that all of the components of the systems  from missiles and engines down to the tires are ready to roll on a moment's notice. The ADA Task Force soldiers constantly are doing systems checks to ensure that the systems are always ready.    Camp Doha is located next a huge water desalination plant and an electrical plant. There are four large smokestacks (nicknamed the Scud goal posts) that spew their contents across Doha.  History    Following Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait in February 1991, Camp Doha emerged as the focal point for US Armed Forces in Kuwait. The threat of future aggression necessitated a presence of US forces to maintain security and stability in the Gulf region. As a result, US military forces began rotating into Kuwait providing security assistance, training exercises and performing necessary contingency planning. Among the first US Army units deployed to Camp Doha after Desert Storm were the 3rd Armored Division, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 8th Infantry Division.    Camp Doha's facilities, services and personnel rapidly grew from two small warehouses to its present 500-acre complex. The original facilities were operated by the Public Warehousing Company and the Kuwait Ports Authority. These installations were subsequently leased by the Kuwait Ministry of Defense and provided to the 3rd US Army to support b|`|32SLOL02aa	Camp Doha no longer exists.

I would speak with friends and family and have them suggest a broker or bank that they have used.  Find someone that you trust and tell them that you are planning to buy a home and see if they have someone they can refer you to. Find a Broker that will pull your credit and shop it to there list of Lenders.  This helps in two ways: 1) your credit is only pulled once, pulling it more than once will show up as an inquiry and will sometimes drop your scores.  2) They shop your situation to all their Lenders and approach you with the BEST possible sollution to your unique needs.  Good Luck!
0ZOHhCnoaa	Unfortunately if you're going full doc or even stated, banks will want to see that you will have a job where you are moving to and what your projected income will be.    For qualifying they will base your income on your jobs for the last 2 years but they will verify your current and will want supporting documents for your future job.    There are many ways around it... For one there is a document type program called "No Doc" where they do not verify any employment and care less where it is.    "Some" lenders will not verify employment on "no ratio" doc types.    I will say this much find a good broker and he/she will always find a way.    In the lenders eyes If you will not have a job right after you move you will not have any income to pay for your mortgage. Chances are you will not be able to get a loan just because there is a great possibilty that you will not be able to make your payments. In today's market that is a risk they're not willing to take.    If you have found or will find a job that will allow you to make payments comfortably then I see no problem. The key is for them to have assurance that you will be able to make your payments.    Update:    It is true if you currently own a home you can apply for a second home type residence if the property is a reasonable distance away from your primary. Otherwise it will be considered an investment property.    loansbyt...: If you'd like a list of a few lenders that do not require employment verification on no ratio shoot me an e-mail. I did have the word some in quotes.|`|8zdE8Ic5aa	Actually, the no ratio loan DOES verify employment.  You have to be working at the same job or same line of work for at least 2 years.  What that program does not do is look at income.  They are going solely off of score and job stability.      Since you are moving to another state, the lender WILL want to see that you have a source of income in that state otherwise, they will consider the new home in Utah a 2nd home.  They will want to see proof of employment in Utah via either a letter from your new employer or they may want you to wait until you get your first paycheck before they fund the loan.  It all depends on who the lender is.  I have had deals just like yours where one lender wanted just a letter from the new employer and another lender wanted to wait until the first paycheck was received before they funded the deal.  I am a mortgage consultant and deal with relocation loans on a daily basis.      Depending on what your goals are......if you want to have a home in UT BEFORE you find a job, get a loan and classify the home as a 2nd home....they will use your current income and employment.  If you don't mind waiting, then you'll have to (at the very most) wait until you get your first paycheck from the new job and can classify the home as a primary residence.  It all depends on what YOUR goals are in the transaction.    Hope this helps.

They usually ask for pay stubs and sometimes have the employer fill out a form confirming your pay.  Good luck.

fQ1tLHY9aa	It's important to save.  Whether you keep money in a savings account or some other type of account depends on how much you you intend to save and how liquid you want the funds to be.      Savings accounts are very liquid and usually have low minimum balances, but unless it's offered by a direct bank like ING, the interest rate will probably be low.  Money market accounts usually pay higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, but they often have higher minimums.  Certificates of deposit usually earn the best rates, but in addition to having higher minimums they tie your money up for a certain period of time ranging from a few months to several years.    Your best bet is to have at least one savings or money market account where you can stash money while keeping it easily available.

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	Overheating is generally preceded by lower than average economic growth. Inflation occurs as suppliers try to capitalize on the excess demand which cannot be met. Higher prices tend to reduce demand and exports (since goods and services become relatively more expensive abroad) leading to reduced consumption. Central banks often simultaneously tighten monetary policy in response to increased inflationary pressures, reducing investment expenditure, which in tandem with decreased consumption, can lead to economic recession.    In general, inflation takes away available money supply to invest in the market as the populace uses this money for higher living expenses.    To safeguard this from happening, and being caught in the downslide of the market, it's best to keep a watchful eye on your investments and be ready to move them into more conservative types of inflation proof commodities, like Silver, and the everyday stuff that we need like, food, medicals, etc.  ///|`|MHdIYQSAaa	It means the economy is accelerating at a pace that is too fast for comfort.

AA10464818	Grants are NEVER given on 5-7 days especially if you are talking of government grants. Grants do not work this way at all    The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.    Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.    There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.

What you are going to get are solicitations like the three responders above me.  These people aren't trying to help you; they're trying to make money.

Therefore, if a stock's price is really high and the board wants more people to buy their shares, they may decide to split the stock.  This is beneficial to the investor because stock prices change on a per share basis.  Therefore, if an investor owns 10 shares that go up $1.00 per share that investor makes $10.

When almost everybody says "buy! buy! buy!" as they are currently doing with Google, that's a sure sign it might be a bubble.    BHP pays a (modest) dividend, and is in a business that will be in business for the foreseeable future.  GOOG probably isn't about to vanish, but their whole business is based on an "idea", so there is always the risk someone will suddenly come along with a better idea that makes them obselete!

But in order to be willing to make a long bet on the stock, I need to feel comfortable that my investment downside was fairly limited despite the risks the company faces.    Downside  Let's assume Google earns $15 this year ($0.12 below current estimates) and only manages 20% growth in 2008, to $18 in earnings per share ($1.25 below current estimates). Let's further assume that Google trades at a P/E of 25 next year. I think both of these assumptions are extremely conservative. A 25 P/E on $18 in earnings gets us a stock price of $450 per share. In my opinion, that is my downside over the next 12 to 18 months, less than 3%!    Upside  A conservative analysis  take the current consensus earnings estimate of 27% growth in 2008, to $19.25 per share and assume that the company continues to beat estimates by a modest amount. It would not be surprising at all to see 2007 EPS numbers head to toward $16.00 by year-end and 2008 numbers to actually come in closer to $20.00 per share. Further, assume GOOG trades at a P/E of 30.    That multiple may seem high given that the market trades at half that valuation. However, Google will grow at least 20% per year over the next few years, so assuming that growth investors will be willing to pay 30 times earnings for the stock is fairly reasonable. It would be in-line with valuations given to other leading Internet companies.    Quick math shows that a 30 P/E on profits of $19.25 to $20.00 in 2008 implies a stock price of $577 to $600 per share. Even if we use a more conservative P/E of 25 instead, we get to $481 to $500 per share. Accordingly, the upside is as much as 30% by the end of 2008. Compare this with downside of less than 3% and you can see why I think Google stock in the low 460s is a good investment, even in an overbought market such as the one we are seeing right now.   ///

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	You're mixing apples and oranges in your questions.  1,2, and 4 refer to stock dividends and question 2 refers to a stock split.     A stock split can be any ratio the directories choose, but it is usually 2:1 or 3:2. The stock is split to make it more affordable. The total amount of equity you own in the company is unchanged by a stock split. For example, if you own 100 shares of a $50.00 stock, that is a total value of $5000.00. If the stock splits 2:1 then you will have 200 shares of a $25.00 stock and that is still a value of $5000.00. The company has no change in capital after the split but is in a position to raise capital more easily when it issues more stock to the public at the lower price. You still have the total $5000.00 invested.    A dividend is a way for a company to distribute retained earning and reduce taxes. For the stock holder, their total equity also does not change when a dividend is paid. The value of the stock is reduced by the amount of the dividend received. Also, if the stock has options traded on it, the value of the call goes down and put goes up by an amount equal to the delta of the option times the amount of the dividend. However, unlike a stock split, the total amount you have invested in the company changed by the amount of the dividend when the dividend is paid.    A cash dividend is a special case of a distribution. The dividend can be paid in the form of stock distribution. In this case, if there is a 5% dividend and you own 100 shares, then you get 5 additional shares. In this way it is the same as a 105:100 stock split. This is a way for the company to "force" a reinvestment of the dividend into the company and changing its tax status from income to stock holder's equity. What if you only have 2 shares of the stock?  They cannot give a factional share, so they give a cash amount equal to 5% of the stock value on the ex-dividend date.     In summary, there is no change in stock holder equity in stock splits but there is with dividends. Said another way, stock splits cause no outflow of capital from the company whereas a dividend does.       Yes, you can purchase the stock any time, before or after the dividend or split.  Your price and the number of shares will be based on the amount you put in and the cost per share at the time of purchase.  ///|`|14epsGd3aa	1. Announced Date is the very date the company made the announcement of split. (Note the date.)    2. Payable date is splitting and/or of dividend payment date.    3. Ex-splitting or ex-dividend date (if any) is the day immediately after spitting and/or paying of dividend. (Note: May 5 and 6 are weekend days, ex-dividend is the 7th.)    Ratio is the number of new shares per old share.  2:1 means for every 1 share you originally own, becomes 2 news shares. So if you have originally 100 shares at $50 share, after the split, you then have 200 shares at $25 per share.    Sometimes the ratio is 5:4, that means for every 4 shares you have, you'll get 5 shares. In such case your originall 100 shares at $50, will become 125 new shares at $40 each.     Mostly, Ex-Date is ahead of Payable Date.    Yes you can still buy the stock according to the date shown. Theoritically can still buy the stock three days before ex-split/dividend date (in this case before Payable date) and still be eligible for split/dividend.  Reason is that settlement of transactions requires maximum of 3 days or else your purchased won't appear on company record and won't then be eligible for split/dividend.

While you are getting back on your feet, you can learn about what makes stocks go up and down. There are many books and websites that explain how to buy stocks.     There are different strategies, and some of them tell you to do the opposite things. For example, one book might tell you to sell your stock if it goes down a little bit, and another book might say if your stock goes down, you can buy more. Don't be confused by things like that. All investment and trading strategies can be divided into two groups: Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis.    Technical Analysis means people look at charts trying to figure out what the stock will do in the future by studying its past. They look at price patterns and draw trendlines. If they find a good chart, they decide to buy the stock and may keep it for a few months or a year until they sell it.    Fundamental Analysis means people are researching facts about a company and looking into financial records to find out what the company is really worth. If they find a valuable company at a low price, they buy it and may end up holding it for 5-10 years until it goes up.    Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are deep subjects and they both work if you learn them well. To give you an example, Warren Buffet made money by studying fundamentals.   ///|`|NbAa9wKvaa	Hi, i recommand you a good and basic tutorial for investing. it covers all Issues related to your Investing and everything around it.    http://www.investingtutorial.info/    wish it will help you.

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	The Initial Public Offering (IPO) for a new public company is the first opportunity for the investing public to be able to purchase shares in the company. An IPO is a very exciting time for the company, and IPOs are often eagerly anticipated by the investing public as well.    There are several reasons for which a private company may wish to become a public company. The two biggest reasons are to raise capital and to allow the original investors or entrepreneurs who started the company to realize profits on their investment and time. A private company is one in which investment or ownership is limited to select individuals or organizations. A public company is one in which anyone can invest and obtain ownership by purchasing shares on a publicly traded exchange.     Undertaking an IPO is a large and exciting event for a new company. A well received IPO means that the company will have cash to further its development and growth. It also usually means that the people who started the company realize some significant profits for their efforts.     An IPO requires a great deal of work, from filing the necessary paperwork with the regulatory bodies and writing a prospectus for potential investors to devising and implementing a sales campaign for the sale of the initial shares. Since the company also needs to continue to function and complete its normal activities, a financial firm is usually hired to do this work. This firm is referred to as the underwriting firm for the IPO. For a really large IPO, the work may even be split between several underwriting firms.  ///|`|MHdIYQSAaa	Its short for Initial Public Offering. Means new public listing.

fc7ec66131fad928efea00305e218a7daa	5% is the risk free rate (money market).    Everything above that involves some sort of risk that you won't get that.  The key is taking the minimum amount of risk to get you to 7% and not taking any more risk than you need.      Here are two strategies.      1) Add some equity to your portfolio.  You will need to add about 20% equity (which historically returns about 11% including dividends per annum over the long-term to get you up to 7%.  You're going to have some volatility in your portfolio, but it won't be bad.     2)  Add diversified high-yield bond funds to your portfolio.  You can get almost 7% by investing in "junk".  The problem with junk is that they have a "risk premium" that fluctuates according to the economy.  Default rates on junk right now is very, very low and risk premiums have basically built in a Goldilocks economy.  In other words, you would be buying high, not low.  The time to buy junk is when things look horrible.    3)  The third way to get to your 7% is much more complex, but I think it is a great strategy.  You go long about 15% equity (invest about 7.5% of your worth in SSO - a double-long S&P 500), 77.5% long bonds (due to higher duration - which will help protect your downside if rates go down since prices will go up) and remaining 15% rolling "put" options on your equity.  The double-long strategy in SSO give you "free" money as it has a built-in interest free loan in it.  It is the only "free lunch" on the market today. The puts give you a few things.  The downside is that puts can expire worthless (but they don't cost much, so it's more of a insurance premium).  However, IF the market goes down, then they will protect your equity investment.  Here's the better  part.  Options are valued largely on "volatility".  Volatility is near an all time low.  So by going long "volatility", you can make more than your money back as the value of your hedge will go up faster than losses in equity - even though you started off with even coverage (15% vs. 15%).    This should get you to about 7%.|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	Yes it is.  Start with about 50% in 5% CDs and 25% in a blend of mutual funds and the remaining 25% in indiviuual stock and monitor your portfolio as follows:    For the investor who aspires to maximize results, monitoring his or her portfolio on a regular basis may be one of the keys to overall investment success. Failure to keep tabs on one's investments can result in missed opportunities as well as a host of other potential problemsmany which may be avoided with proper attention to detail. Here is a brief overview of why monitoring an investment portfolio can be so important.      1. Missed buy-side opportunities      Remaining in tune with the market is essential to long-term portfolio success. When the market heats up, buy opportunities can come and go daily. By not monitoring your portfolio, and, in turn, the markets, investors almost assure that they will not have the necessary pulse on the precise pricing movements of the market or their portfolio.      2. Missed exit opportunities      While failure to closely follow the markets can lead to missed buy opportunities, doing so is perhaps even more harmful when missing out on appropriate exit opportunities. Markets, stock prices, and investor sentiment are all dynamic. A solid position that would generate a gain one instant can turn into a potential loss the next by simply failing to keep one's ear to the tracks, so to speak.      3. Mismanaged risk budget      Failure to keep tabs on a portfolio may also result in an inadvertently exposing assets to more risk than was originally planned.      4. Information lag      If you don't monitor your portfolio or the markets on a regular basis puts you at a disadvantage in that they likely are not armed with the information needed to make both a timely and an informed trading decision. Active traders continually monitor a variety of technical indicators and trends. Thus, each trade, at least in theory, is based on a historical databank of what has been going on in the market in recent days and weeks. Those who dart in and out of the market every couple of months (or some other interval) have some catching up to do and may be best suited to get the lay of the land before trading. At the same time, waiting it out may result in lost buy or sell opportunities.      5. Trading tactics differ under different market conditions      To manage your portfolio effectively, it is important to be aware that markets have different phases, and, as such, stock prices can move in different directions at different times. In this regard, it may not be prudent for an investor to have a "set it and forget it" attitude when it comes to a portfolio of individual stocks. For instance, in a bull market, stocks, in general, tend to follow an upward trend with only occasional downturns. In a bear market, on the other hand, stocks are typically trending downward most of the time, with only a few minor upward movements along the way. Of course, this is a simplistic overview. The truth is that there tend to always be opportunities during any market that are typically overshadowed by the market's overall performance.      6. Consistency in overall asset allocation strategy      Always be in tune with your asset allocation strategy. It is quite plausible to assume that an investor's trading account comprises only a certain percentage of his or overall investable assets. Even so, major swings in a trading account due to unexpected downturns in several key holdings can alter one's allocation when taken as a whole. Proper monitoring can help ensure that a desired overall asset allocation is maintained.   ///

YS3NnJtHaa	Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is an expression of the effective interest rate that will be paid on a loan, taking into account one-time fees and standardizing the way the rate is expressed. The aim of using APR is to calculate a total cost of borrowing. APR is intended to make it easier to compare lenders and loan options.  The APR is likely to differ from the "note rate" or "headline rate" advertised by the lender.    While there are several acceptable ways to calculate the exact APR, the general process is:  1. Total the included one-time costs and add them to the face amount on the loan   2. Calculate a monthly payment for that amount at the loan's "note rate"   3. Calculate what interest rate would have to be applied to just the face amount of the loan in order to equal the calculated monthly payment in step 2.     In a simplified example, if you borrow $100 for one year at 5% interest (so that you will owe $105 at the end of the year) and you pay the lender a $5 origination fee, your total cost to borrow the money will be $10 ($5 in a year for interest plus $5 now for the origination fee). Your APR will come out at just over 10%.|`|h1m17rStaa	Rate is the actual rate your loan balance is being charged.  APR is your rate, plus a portion of your closing costs and some other items, calculated and amortized over the course of the entire loan.    APR was meant to make it easier for for people to shop varying credit offers.  For example, is it cheaper to finance $100,000 at 6.5% with no fees, or 6.00% with 2 discount points?  Most people can't do that math properly.    However, APR is basically meaningless on any ARM loan, since it's impossible to estimate what your future rate will be over the adjustable period.    And more importantly, it does NOT factor in the fact that over 90% of all first mortgages are paid off with a refi or sale within the first 7 years.  Your realistic time in your home or mortgage is a very important part of deciding which option is best for you.    So, unfortunately, the most important thing to do is find a good loan officer who can accurately calculate your total cost over the time you believe you'll be in the home.|`|84dffb655e0e1e1c65f062e4287717b1aa	MORTGAGE RATE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOUR PAYMENT WILL BE OFF THE MORTGAGE RATE.

Yes people still use brokers, and more commonly Financial Advisors (which are brokers with more licenses that take a broader look at one's financial picture)    2. In most "broker" roles you do have to start out with some form of cold calling or other "cold" prospecting techniques. Many firms will promise no cold-calling, but you end up doing some variation of the cold-call.    3. Managing hedge funds is probably the most lucrative job in the industry today, although many brokers/advisors make upwards of $1M / year.    4. The people on "the floor" are mostly Traders (and clerks, trading assistants, and specialists) and they are either placing large trades for brokerage firms, mutual funds, independent trading firms or themselves. Most of the time they have no idea who they are placing order for. Although it seems like chaos, it is actually very efficient and one of the most pure forms of a "free-market" in the world.    5. Orders from web sites are usually executed through computer systems that do the same thing that the specialists on the floor do, which is match up buy and sell orders to create a market.    6. As to why don't they just trade electronically instead of on "the floor. The best answer is tradition...because that's how it has always been done. The electronic trading side of the business has grown tremendously over the last decade or so and could over take traditional trading, although we may never see the total loss of the stock exchanges.

u1rDl3e8aa	Yes you can do it with an FHA loan, they will use your Ch 13 pay history and as long as everything is current with your CH 13 and ou have not taken on any new or delinquent credit you may have a shot. The issue is going to be your Debt ratios and with FHA they should be around 31% for your housing ratio and 41% for your overall debt.       The major issue is you have to get BK courts approval inorder to incur any new debt, and that is a major problem. If  your housinng payment is going up they probably will not approve you.    Currently if you are not able to save money and your potential housing payment is more then your rent you should wait out the CH 13 and then look at a loan when it is over.

UV8bN0Giaa	It's not that complicated other than having enough in savings for the downpayment and settlement.  Then simply a matter of showing proof to the lender (financial institution) when applying for your mortgage that your joint income (assuming title will be in both names) is enough to make the monthly payments when taking into consideration your other debts.    If savings is tight, then you and your fiance might have to carefully review priorities and maybe buy the house first...but that might be OBE (Overcome By Events) bec you already said the wedding & reception is low cost.    Off the top of my here: (i) you might have the agent write a contract with RENT with OPTION TO BUY.  (ii)  then again some other good tips is selecting an Agent and asking upfront as well as getting in writing if they will share the real estate commission bec often times you have nothing to lose and if they agree, sometimes your portion would be 1% of $80,000 = $800    Good Luck!|`|0awnte3Uaa	There are still many programs out there for first time homebuyers to buy a home with little to no down payment needed.

Frankly though, a home in the eighties sounds VERY low-priced (in my area you could not even get a tent for that amount of money! I am kidding, of course, but honestly, a home in the eighties?!).  Be wary because this home could need a lot of repair (and I mean a lot).  You never know just by looking at the home what it may need.  Where is this located?

h1m17rStaa	NO.    You've searched everywhere and found nothing, because you just can't escape the IRS.  It's black and white.  You owe.    Unless, of course, before you sell it, you move back and live in it for 2 of the previous 5 years, in total.  So rent it for 3 years, move back in for 14 months, and you're good to go.|`|MoYM9Hssaa	1031 exchange or turn it back into your residence for 14 more months, provided you lived there in the past 5 years.|`|fcf5d8f02277dc28c3e70ba8462bcd67aa	1031 exchange. Must buy a like property. I searched and found this website which has pretty good answers.|`|uRyCIYzzaa	Maybe there is a way to escape at least some of your capital gains assuming your actually have a capital gains problem.     If you've lived in a house that was your personal residence for any 2 of the past 5 years, $250,000 of YOUR CAPITAL GAIN (not the sale price) is tax free. It's up to $500,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.     You say you've only lived there 10 months but you still might be entitled to a prorata portion of any potential capital gains  depending on why you moved.    You can still qualify for a portion of the maximum tax free gain if youve lived in your home as little as one year of the past 5.    Those circumstances are:    * Death   * Disability   * Multiple Births from the same pregnancy   * Change in employment   * Change in self employment     If you meet the qualifying circumstances married taxpayer could still qualify for up to $250,000 and single folks up to $125,000 of tax free gain.    Check the IRS website or your CPA for more direction.
AA10423600	Yes it is true....many times longer.    What you going to do about utilities?|`|h1m17rStaa	I'd search for something like "foreclosure redemption period (insert your state here).      I assume it varies by state.  Some are 6 months after the sheriff's sale.  Some might be less.    If they see you are damaging the property, they can kick you out sooner too.  Look it up and figure it out.|`|b118ce15dadb2b7750b4ca189f3c820aaa	huh??
u1rDl3e8aa	Why would you want to pay the costs to refinance your home for a few thousand dollars. The cost to refinance alone would probably be more then you are taking out. On the other hand you might not be able to refinance anyway if your house is listed on the market. Appraisers have to list whether you haouse has been listed in the last 12 months and if it has then many lenders will not offer you a refinance, or the rates will not be good.    One option would be to do an equity line if your house has not been listed yet.|`|h1m17rStaa	Bad idea.    A:  don't refinance.  Get an equity loan with no closing costs, since refinancing costs thousands.    B.  If the home is on the market, most banks won't let you take cash out of it.    C.  Doing this might limit your ability to drop your price if the market isn't where you hoped it was.    I'd be very careful.  I'd make sure to leave 10% of the equity just to cover any price reductions, on top of your realtor commission of 5-7%.  Basically, if you already owe more than 80% of your expected selling price, you don't have enough equity to risk this.  If you're under, not a great idea but could work, but avoid paying closing costs.|`|8xmcqvFkaa	You won't have that option... When the lender sees on your appraisal that your home is on the market, they will not lend to you.  Some lenders require that it also be off the market for a period of time if you were trying to sell it.    This includes not being able to do an Equity line like "Nick" suggested.  There's a chance you can find an equity line, but it won't be a "no cost" one.|`|swieIByiaa	DON'T Refinance unless they will roll all the closing costs into the interest rate, and don't tell the lender you will be selling soon.  A lender isn't likely to give you a loan if they know you are going to sell it soon.  They won't make any money
h1m17rStaa	Nope.  They fully replaced the old "step-up" law with the new one.    $250K for single, $500K married is tax-free, if you've lived in the home as your primary residence for 2 of the past 5 years.    It's only long-term capital gains, I believe, on that $300K.  Which is still $45K, quite a bit of money.    How on earth can you gain $800K on a single home in 7 years?  You sure you got your cost basis right???  Acquisition costs, capital improvements, etc... all accounted for?    Consult a CPA to be sure there's no other loophole you could take advantage of, but I think you'll end up owing on the profits over $500K.|`|ZR8RQJc0aa	Sadly, I believe you will be taxed a long-term capital gains tax on the amount above $500k.  A "like kind" tax deferred exchange would only work regarding investment properties I believe (you would have to use a qualified intermediary or exchange company for the transaction, but in your case of owner-occupied homes, it wouldn't apply anyhow).    I truly believe this bad news is true.....I am an agent out in the west and that's what I was told by a big Tax Deferred Exchange Company.|`|h3MhFmJaaa	Old rule section 134 was replaced by new rule section 121.    Thank you lucky stars, the old rule forgave $125,000 the new one $500,000 if you're married.    The 1997 taxpayer relief act made a big difference in the tax liability of those who sell their primary residence. As it stands today, almost no one will pay any federal taxes on the profit made from the sale of the home they live in. (defined by the Internal Revenue Service simply as the place you live most of the time). To qualify, you must have owned and occupied the home as your primary residence for a minimum of any two of the five years before you sell.     A single owner can take up to $250,000 gain free of any federal or state tax.    A married couple, filing jointly can take up to $500,000. gain free of any federal or state tax. Even if only one of them owns the property, the full $500,000. is available only if the non-owner spouse occupied the property for the required 2 years.    You can move back into income property for 2 years and pay no taxes on the portion you reside in (1/2 for a duplex, 1/4 for a fourplex).    You can even use part of the exclusion if you were in the house less than the full two years. If you move is required by one of three reasons: job transfer, health reasons, or some unforeseen reason.

h1m17rStaa	In most markets, $5500 sounds just about right.  There's quite a bit of variance on taxes, insurance and title insurance by state.    I don't quite get the "credit", since you can't just keep the overage.  It's supposed to be applied to the loan.  The seller would have to give that money to you after closing, as a personal check.      But at that loan size, you're right at about 3% of purchase price, which is very normal.|`|dsJWq6wNaa	1 point is equal to 1% of the amount you are borrowing. In your case, its $1,710. The $500 you are receiving at closing is actually coming from the amount you are borrowing. Banks like nice round numbers.  They will round up and give you the difference.  $500 is no big deal.  Use it on the new home.    The settlement statement is actually a listing of where all the money is going.  Look it over carefully.  CHECK THE AMOUNT OF POINTS YOU ARE PAYING.  Although you said you are paying 1 pt., beware of "back-end" points as well.

1be2b95b2be28376e1cc35232af44c40aa	FIrst worry about getting an offer.  When you do get the offer, now is the time to talk about compensation.  In the future, avoid discussing money until later in the process unless you think you may be wasting your time.    If they bring it up again before making any committments about a desire to hire you, take that as an opportunity to ask if they are intending to offer you the job. You can also answer a question with a question, say about the responsibilities and the value the person in the position brings to the company. Always avoid discussions about what you made in the past as well. Salary is not the main reason you are looking for a new position, even if it is! (unless you are in sales, then you can be money hungry, its expected),    Normally your best negotiating tips are to say nothing, or, if you can't stand the silence, say "I don't know." Anything to get them talking.  The more they talk, the more money you will get, or at least more info on what kind flexibility they have.    Since you already made the mistake of asking for too little, you still shouldn't settle for that. Ask them what your peers would be making.  Note that if you are doing the same job, you expect similar compensation.  If you are starting low due to inexperience, ask when you will be reviewed and what the outcome of that review will be if you are outperforming your peers.  Remember, some large companies have strict rules that limit raises.  If this company is one of those, you want to start high as you can, and if you are getting promised consideration for a raise in the future, you want it in writing so that HR can't rule it out later (because they often do).    Good luck, get the offer first, then discuss salary.  Usually the offer comes with an offer of compensation.|`|77bd798be57f2d922d4428bbfcd62362aa	Ask for an Evaluation . . .|`|b7905b75c80a34efae2ce2b853ddaf7aaa	look for another job and let them know you have an offer and lie  tell them it is 3thou more than you are making  if you are a good worker just tell them you are not making enough and you are going to look for another job and they will offer you more money|`|AA12170170	Employers ask that question not for a range (they will decide it for you no matter) but to see how you value yourself. You failed. They know that you think you are expendable and desperate enough to state your salary lower to get the job. this tells the employer you are out of touch and just their to get a job. i mean know offense, it's just the only way I know to put it. There is nothing wrong with researching competitive salaries and stating accurately how much you should make-and then, always increase it a little more-nothing too crazy, just enough to show them that you know you are worth it. Just remember, conventional notions (things that easily make sense) in the job environment is ubiquitous (all too common); standing out and thinking outside the box is what will separate you from the millions that did the same thing you did.

You will never be unemployed unless you want to be.     You will, at some point, have to try and develop a specialty. Taxes, audit, investments, management accounting, cost accounting, small business, fraud auditing, forensic accounting, bankruptcy, etc., etc.    Early on, the hours can be tough, depending on your market. NY and some other areas, I imagine Chicago, are brutal. Places like Maine are easier, but still tough.     I do IT auditing and fraud auditing. I honestly love going to work every single day.     But I am a strange person.

6HdFNO2zaa	Forex Business  Foreign Exchange Currency Trading (Forex) is the exchange of money between different countries. The value of one countrys currency is constantly changing against the value of another countrys currency. Forex traders make money through buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market.     Online Forex trading is a nonstop cash market. It is one of the fastest growing industries on the internet. It attracts a wide range of individuals, from beginners to more experienced traders. Anyone with access to the internet, a valid credit card and with a minimum cash deposit can share in the excitement.     There are many affiliate programs. Forex trading is todays most exciting arena for investors as it offers a desirable product with mass market appeal.     How it works   Foreign exchange is an exciting market. Individual traders trade on margin. For example, a stake of just $100 gives a trader access to a deal worth $10,000 (using a leverage of 1: 100). Markets fluctuate constantly and for a margin trader every little move is magnified 100 times. And while potential profit is unlimited, the trader can only lose their initial investment  for this example, $100.     For example:      Leverage (gearing) enables you to hold a position worth up to 100 times more than your margin deposit. For example, a USD 1,000 deposit can command positions of up to USD 100,000 through leverage. If you believe that the euro will strengthen against the dollar you'll want to buy euro now and sell it back later at a higher price.     You want to buy the euro - We quote EUR/USD at 1.2501 (bid) 1.2505 (ask), which means that you can buy 1 euro for 1.2505 USD. In this example you buy EUR 100,000, at the quote price of 1.2505 USD per euro.   The market moves in your favor - EUR/USD is now quoted at Bid 1.2515 Ask 1.2519   Now you sell your euro and get the profit - You sell euro at a price of 1.2515   The profit is calculated as follows - Sell price-buy price x size of trade  (1.2515 minus 1.2505) multiplied by EUR 100,000 = USD 100 Profit|`|lEXTHOZPaa	As there are lot of scams you can build your own blogs with http://www.blogger.com/ and submit to https://www.google.com/adsense/ and earn through Google ad sense program.|`|QAavCKelaa	buy a website|`|2K84ouyKaa	find a good product to distribute and make a fortune in a recession make as much as you like based on your efforts|`|Gt8NoO2waa	Naked!

Print up all your evidence, go to Kinkos or The UPS Store etc. and fax it all to your boss's boss...    There is a high likelihood that you will be named because access to such documents may be only accessible to you or a small number of people...    Personally, I would just go in and do it...

However, the documents can still be traced back to you because when they were save/created they were automatically encoded with your name as the author and the ID of the computer used to create them.  You're better off printing them all out and faxing them from the UPS Store, Kinko's, etc. Preferably from a location that is not near your home. The fax machine on the receiving end automatically prints out the name and fax number of the sending machine. If these documents are highly confidential..the sort very few people have access to, you still might get the finger pointed at you.  There is a whistle blower law but it only applies to OHSA violations (health and safety). Your boss stealing, lying, and wasting resources does not fall under OSHA violations.

f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Wow, I went through Steve's long winded answer and it's full of garbage. First off if you are an independent contractor then this means you would have to have had a contract to work a specific amount of time. If they let you go after the contract expired then we can say no you do not qualify right off the bat. If they let you go before the contract then you may have a case for a breach of contract lawsuit, however to qualify for EI you you must show that:  -you have been without work and without pay for at least 7 consecutive days; and  -in the last 52 weeks or since your last claim (this period is called the qualifying period) you have worked for the required number of insurable hours.     The hours are based on where you live and the unemployment rate in your economic region at the time of filing your claim for benefits. For instance in Toronto you must have worked a minimum of 630 insurable hours in order to qualify for regular benefits (Vancouver 700, PEI 490, etc). If no one has been deducting EI premiums, then no one has been reporting that you have been working any insurable hours. Without these insurable hours reported you would not qualify for EI. If you had no formal contract with the company you were working for then maybe (big maybe) you could have some grounds for an appeal, however you would owe EI contributions for the time you were working for the company. More info about EI program below.
F66hnqlIaa	Depends on what you want to do with the claim. Since your permanently disabled you need to ask the adjuster if you qualify for vocational rehab. If you are qualified for it than you'll go to school for about 6-48 months. If you go to school you'll get paid while your off work.     However if you don't want to go to school you can settle your indemnity portion of the claim from anywhere between $10,000-$15,000. This amount is tax free.    As for your 11% I'm not sure what the rate is in CA but I think you might be getting around $10,000-$30,000 for your whole person impairment.    So when you are looking at this you might get about close to $50,000 in PPD and settlement. If you want to go to VR than your settlement will go down in value.    Also keep in mind that the adjuster might review the file and if your a low wage earner than they might not consider settlement at all. The only money you might get would be the 11% value.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Settlement is on future medical bills - at 11% disability, you're most likely going to get retrained for a different job.  Disability - future lost wages - would be heavily dependent on how old you are, and what you used to do - but that injury was four years ago, so likely, you're looking at 11% of lost wages (difference between what you're capable of earning now, in a new job, and what you used to earn) for one year.  And a NEW job, a desk job, might actually earn you more.     You don't get pain and suffering with workers comp.
AkHj5xeSaa	I'm not really sure what you're asking...maybe more info would be helpful?    Ok. With SSD, there is a 5 month waiting period before you can start getting paid. You have to be disabled for 5 months before they'll pay you. If you became disabled in July 1st '08, the pay wouldn't pick up for 5 full months, so it would pick up the 1st of January. So your "back pay" may be less than you anticipated.     When my husband became disabled, the "back pay" was deposited with his first monthly check.|`|oHUDTX7aaa	The back pay will often come somewhat later as it takes a while to calculate the correct amount.

Extended Unemployment Insurance Benefits:    Chicago - Under a new federal law that took effect on November 21st, up to 20 weeks worth of emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) benefits are now available for eligible individuals. Previously, individuals could only receive up to 13 weeks worth of EUC benefits.    Eligible individuals who exhausted their rights to EUC benefits, based on the previous 13-week maximum, can receive up to seven more weeks worth, for weeks beginning on or after November 23rd.

p1m4wNx3aa	Hey! You work at a sports authority too! Isn't this new program great! *rolls eyes* I'm the footwear lead at my store, so let me see if I can help you any.    Ok, first off, have you spoken with your own footwear lead? If they are worth their salt any at all, they should already know how to successfully sell shoes. Pick their brain a bit, watch them with customers, ask them about any key phrases that they might use with customers. If they aren't totally stuck on themselves, then they should be able to help you out a little.    If that doesn't work out, then here's a few tips and tricks:  First: LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN. Listen to the customer, they can tell you alot about what they need, if they run alot, where they run, what activities they are involved in.    Go from there. Spend a little time in the department and do a little research. Ask the managers about doing a couple of the footwear training courses. Any little bit of knowledge that you have helps.    Stay with the customer for the entire sale. Don't just point out the correct shoe and then walk away, Stay with them and chat a bit. If they are going on a trip, ask them where. If they play sports, ask them what position. If its a guy and you're a girl, flirt with him. In doing this, you can also find out more about their needs and be able to suggest more items that they might be interested in, maybe even lead them back to your department where you are more comfortable and continue the sale there.    If you are uncomfortable with trying to sneak the sticker onto the box then just tell them why your doing it. 'The company started a new program where they are tracking our sales and making sure that we are spending enough time on the customers needs.' If you tell them that you are doing it to help them and to make their trip to the store easier and more pleasant, then they shouldn't take offense. If anything, they'll laugh and say that they understand.    Just don't push too hard. You want to make sales, but you don't want to push customers away or make them uncomfortable. It's a very fine line.    The main point is to be helpful. Be helpful and listen to what they have to say.    Sorry for writing you a book, but every little bit helps.  BTW, which region are you in?|`|90821cfb70581e2ebe003864dabcc449aa	Just be simple and direct.  Ask them what type of shoe they are looking for.  Fake interest in their reason for looking for a shoe.  Recommend a good name brand, then offer to take it to the register for them.

Basically, it's a small file that gets installed into your web browser (i.e. Firefox).    When you do a Google search, the software automatically places a "view keywords" button below every single Adwords advertiser.    Click the "view keywords" button and really neat popup window appears that not only shows you the keywords that any Adwords advertiser is bidding on, but it also shows you a TON of other information,   like how much they're paying per click and so on.

If it's something longer-term than that, like something that's 10 years off, or even longer than that (retirement), then the stock market is a good place for your money.    As a side note, I use ING and I recommend them very highly - I have similar accounts and Citibank, E*TRADE, and Emigrant Direct, but ING is my favorite.

AA11413749	I would guess it's a name for the tactic where you take someone else's good credit (with permission, of course) and have it applied to your own.    Like say your grandmother has had a particular department store credit card since 1975, never missing a payment and otherwise being an all-around superb customer. You can get her to make you an authorized user on the account and then the store will report to the credit bureaus that card in your file, so you get "credit" for alllll of the good payment history even though you might've only been "on" the account for a couple of months. This is especially worthwhile if grandma or whoever keeps the card sent out for you as well; that way she's not in danger of having you rack up anything on the account and you're getting the benefit of her financial stability.

It's very detailed.|`|aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	If you have wanted this for so long it seems you would have asked these questions before. There is a big difference in wanting and wishing.  One is something you are willing to work for  the other is a fantasy. But, yes, when you do your internship at a hospital, the actual hands on training, you are very sleep deprived, never watched E.R. or Scrubs or any of those Hospital shows? Yes, they stay up and sleep in little rooms, steal naps and are pushed to the limit. It is not easy that's for sure. There is 7 yrs. of schooling and training and more if you specialize and thousands and thousands of dollars in costs as well as no life for those years because you don't have the time. Look it up on the net.|`|GGwAqW30aa	How to become a doctor:   1. get good grades in high school [ by that i mean straight a's]  2. take a ton of AP courses  3. do well on the AP tests [by that i mean 4s and 5s]  4. graduate close at the top of your class  5. apply to college  6. get accepted into a good college  7. do well in college [ by that i mean straight a's]   8. graduate with highest possible honors   9. apply to med school   10. do well in med school [and by that i mean straight a's/ kiss up to the professors]  11. graduate med school with highest honors.   12. get into a residency program at a hospital such as kaiser  13. spend three years in residency  14. kiss up to your designated doctor  15. finally get to operate/ see patients on your own     it also helps to get in to a good volunteer program from the time you are young.  That allows you to shadow doctors when you come to about the age of 16.  Also, try to get into pre med programs right after high school that will help you to mayb skip a coupple years of college.     Hope it helps and good luck!      Kylie

Many brides are getting savvy in this area and now know to ask to see the raw footage as well as the final cut. If you don't have a reel put together get a few weddings under your belt. You might want to start offering your services for free to family and friends just so you have a variety of wedding styles. Also contact every wedding coordinator in your area and event planners from some of the popular wedding facilities like resort hotels. Let them know you're available.

m0ISF8klaa	It seems to me that saving the planet = less profit or no profit, cause so many companies aren't willing to do it. And it's not just them, many consumers are not willing to change their habits either.     Haven't you noticed all of the gargantuan SUVs running around even though vehicle fuel costs  $3.20 per gallon (a staggeringly high price)? I suppose not until we're paying what Australia pays for gas ($5.15 per gallon) will we change our ways. Not until extremes hit them, do Americans change their ways.    Recycling is a good option, but companies don't provide enough of an incentive to recycle. Most people don't want to lug a bag of aluminum cans around just to redeem $5.00. It's not worth it to most people, which is why most aluminum cans are discarded.    Why did plastic bags at grocery stores become the standard?

Its basically like a contract, "you bid on it so you agreed to it" type of deal.     "return the item to the seller before they will refund the purchase price?"..sellers do this so that the seller gets their item back(probably in hopes of re-selling the item).. and lets face it most buyers don't want to go through the aggravation of sending something back (not to mention paying for shipping)unless its a major problem. So in the end the seller is less likely to get anyone wanting to return an item.    best of luck    |`|bc48a41d3261992556f9ca6984e840e1aa	Yes.

My fiancee did this  against my advice (the withdrawal, not the purchase)  to buy a piece of land with a trailer  and  a cottage , and paid a huge dollar penalty in addition to uncollected income taxes on the cash, so avoid doing this if possible .

Tipos de socios    Segn el lmite de su responsabilidad frente a las deudas de la sociedad los socios pueden ser:    Socios con responsabilidad limitada: En una sociedad annima o una sociedad de responsabilidad limitada, la ley limita la responsabilidad de los socios a la cuanta de capital que se han obligado a aportar a la sociedad.

Most people work for themselves.    You should really avoid all the things like rebate processing, data entry, surveys, blogs, or mlm or paypal pyramid schemes.

The more legitimate ways of making money online are things like selling on ebay or outside of ebay or affiliate marketing or selling digital products.

It's harder than it sounds to actually sit infront of your computer for up to 6 hours a day and just work.    Sure it sounds easy enough, then you sit down to do it. The hardest thing I always find is just focusing. So listening to the radio or music helps but then you're being less productive with what you're doing.

Tell her you would like to pay her back on a set amount of time, and draw up a contract.    Financing a home is costly.  Ours was 5 grand in closing costs alone.  I don't think you can take out a HELOC  if you don't have a mortgage - I'm pretty sure.  /|`|AA12206708	Not sure other answer is correct.  Your mother can deduct interest on the loan IF it's secured by real estate/her home.  A home equity loan CAN be the only mortgage you have on your property.  It's just what it says; a loan against the equity in your house.  People forget that most home equity loans are "second" mortgages against a house however, they can be a first.  A mortgage is a mortgage.    Yes, refinancing would be a great way to pay your mother back provided you and your husband have the income to repay the mortgage.  My assumption is that you would have a great LTV (loan to value) on your property as you have NO mortgages against it.  Since you say you have two purposes for your loan, take out ONE mortgage because second mortgages are usually much higher rates.  Just borrow enough for you to have an emergency fund and put those funds in a money market or somewhere else that pays a little interest and is easily accessible.  Not pushing for them, but take a look at americanequity.com  If they are located in your state, they specialize in these sort of loans.  But check with your bank or credit union.    Based upon the limited information you have, I still think that you will be able to do what you want.  Technically, you could take out a first mortgage to pay your mother back and a second for your home equity line but the rate would be higher.  Another possibility would be to take out a home equity line of credit and only draw down enough to pay your mother, leaving the remaining balance "undrawn" so that no interest accrues.  That would give you the emergency fund you want.  But make sure you examine all options.

They are a big unregulated industry. Just write them a certified letter, state you disagree with their terms, put the cards in a drawer and make the payments until you can pay them off. That's your only option. You can try and do a balance transfer to a lower rate card. They are trying to make up for all the losses they have had. The people who pay on time are the ones who suffer. That's how it works.|`|52C0HULyaa	hmm,mmmmmm|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Sue those bloody bas(t)ards.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	I got the same letter.  I believe it said the "default rate" would be much higher.  The default rate only takes effect if you are behind on payments.  If you make payments on time, you should be OK.
qdsVS1dDaa	The 1099R box 12 is for state distribution. If there is a dollar amount in box 10-state tax withheld, there must be an amount in box 12.     I suggest that you look in your state income tax booklet and see how to compute this. Or call your state tax department. It may be just the distribution minus the federal tax, or something else.

AA11284831	Yes, you need to file every year that the corp exists regardless of income.  Ditto for your State corp return.  Many states levy a minimum franchise fee for corps regardless of profit or loss and you will have to pay that.
AA10274297	Yes, the free edition should get you that deduction and/or credit.  The other editions of turbo tax enhance the ability to import investment data, but that is about it.    You can claim either a Hope credit or a lifetime learning credit if you are not claimed as a dependent on anyone else's return.  If you are more than half time, use the Hope credit, and if you are less than half time use the lifetime learning credit.  They are not refundable credits, but if you do owe some federal tax, then using one of these credits will increase your refund, probably by about $200.|`|AA10469473	Are you a dependent?

You still have time to get it done and may even still get a refund, even changing your filing status to dependent.
AA10469473	Depends on what you did with the $26,000.  If you provided over half of your own support, then no they can't claim you.

ZvU093GPaa	you need to file an amendment to your taxes
OfPQVR1Naa	First a question:  You said you receive a disability check... because your dad is on disability or are you also disabled?      If you are getting a check because of your dad, then the ONLY reason they are giving you a check is because he has listed you as a dependent.  If you weren't a dependent, you wouldn't get a check.    If this is the case, you MUST allow them to claim you, else you might stop receiving your check.    But if that's not the case....      -A fully and permanently disabled child can be claimed as a dependent.    -A full-time student (for at least 5 months out of the year) under the age of 24 can be claimed as a dependent.    -Since you're 18, you can claim yourself.    But you can't BOTH claim you as a dependent.  Either one or the other.  The IRS keeps track of Social Security Numbers... A SSN can be claimed as a dependent only once, either on YOUR tax return or THEIRS.  The IRS doesn't care who claims you, just as long as your SSN shows up on just ONE tax return.      That said...    If you lived at home while attending school, and your parents fed you, and housed you, and provided electricity and heat and water...  then morally you should allow them to claim you.    If you lived alone (which I don't see how you could have on only $5000) then you should definitely claim yourself.      Here's a link to the IRS's actual rules on "Qualifying Dependents" for filing tax year 2008:    http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...|`|o5aHZ1Xdaa	you can go either way.    If your parents are greedy (like mine) they will try to claim you as a dependent for as long as they can. You loose more money, but they get a sweet return for it.    You could claim yourself, and get a better return, but it will probably make them angry. I would recommend that you bargain with them so you both win when they claim you, if you know what i mean.    good luck,    Shamar
02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	I agree with 2sweet.   And, just to add that it is not fair for those in bad schools with high drop out rates because students have to chance of getting to college.   And, its also not fair to poorer people that have to little or no chance to go to colllege even if they can.       And, being poor does not mean you are less reponsible or have more accidents.

All of them are based on statistical experience.  People with better grades have less accidents - this is a proven fact.  Same for good/bad credit, age, etc.      The insurer is gambling on anyone they issue a policy to.  Just like a bookie in Vegas who sets odds on a game.  They use proven historical patterns to set rates.|`|1e276cf277894bd2387532152b4db7a6aa	Insurance is a very researched based industry based on probability.  They have found that their is statistical significance that says that students who academically are successful, are less likely to be involved in claims (i.e. accidents).  So no, its not discrimination, but statistical data that allows them to do it.  And it benefits the consumer.|`|Qw4BNNkhaa	Car insurance companies want drivers who are going to be responsible behind the wheel. Apparently, they believe that someone with good grades is being responsible and is less likely to be in an accident.|`|Px5PLHAQaa	Yes it is! As a matter of fact, most nerds are uncoordinated and accident prone. If we are going to be subject to this type of selective pricing, then we should also be priviledged to have access to the data that supports it. My bet is that it doesn't exist! I was a C student and never had an accident or filed a claim in all my years of driving. I know several straight A students who have been involved in multiple claims. This may very well be another form of institutional racism and you have made quite an interesting point!

K7x1RHVFaa	First of all you can not file married separate and her file head of household, you both have to file the same status married filing separate. What is more, if one of you itemizes then both of you have to itemize. And you AGI will calculate itself out based on your filing status and the income and deductions you include. I am missing how you thought your wife could qualify as HOH. Who is the dependent? It cannot be you. So who is it? Whoever it is you can not claim.     To be frank you need to create more details if you really want an AGI here.    Good Luck.|`|AA12384303	The AGI  from the previous year..
3vHGjuBgaa	Are you filing and claiming yourself...or are you filing as a dependent because your parents are claiming you? If you file and claim yourself for the first time, then you will at least qualify for the stimulus rebate since it sounds like you did not receive one last year. But, since your income was so low, you would probably only qualify for the lesser amount per individual which is $300.    However, since your income was only $4000, you will probably get your federal back that you paid in. So, I am roughly estimating about $600 for your federal refund, not sure about your state....probably what you paid in.    You can efile for FREE....just go to the IRS free file site and pick a tax prep company and start putting in your info! It will keep a running total of your refund and let you know before you do the final submission how much you will be getting back.    Here's the link to the free file site:  http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=1...    Basically most companies like H & R Block or TaxAct for example will let you efile for free since your income is under $54,000 although they will charge you to file your State tax return.

AA10469473	I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.    Look at your W-2.  If there is a number in box 2, you will get some or all of that back - of box 1 is less than $5450 you should get the whole amount in box 2 back.

dC6A5R5Saa	At 20, I wouldn't recommend putting it in a retirement fund.  It might be tax free, but having you money locked away more than 40 years is a long time to wait to get access to it.    If you're thinking about mutual funds, do some research because there's a lot of them.  When the market was down last year, some funds wouldn't let their investors access their money which I think was wrong.    Maybe keep half in the bank in case you need  it and invest the other half.      I think IBM shares are good.  They pay dividends quarterly and increase them yearly: http://www.ibm.com/investor/pdf/ibm_ir_d...    The company has been increasing its profits every year.  If the market has a fall, IBM eventually bounces back up.    Intel's another example.  Its dividend yield is 4.30%  http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=intc    If you buy shares for income (dividends) when the market is down, that's actually the best time to buy while all the dividend yields are higher.    Income investors don't care about the share price because they never plan to sell.  They don't sell when shares prices are high and once a blue chip stocks down-trends a fair way they start buying more to add to their positions and increase their dividend income stream.    If the share price goes up and the dividend yields gets too low, they stop buying and look elsewhere.      An excellent example is General Electric shares.  If you're wondering who these crazy people are buying the shares off the sellers on a dontrend, their mostly the income investors.  GE has a dividend yield of about 9%.  If GE goes lower, they'll just buy more and get an even higher divdidend yield.  Once GE goes up and the dividend yield looks more like 2.64%, they'll stop buying and look elsewhere.    General Electric made over $18 billion in net profit last year, it's not going to go down forever and it's not going bankrupt.  As long as the company is financialy healthy and paying dividends, that's all income investors want to know.    Some good examples of income stocks that raise their dividend each year. include Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's, Intel, IBM and the Coca Cola Company.    With shares, you may have to pay tax on the dividends, but you don't have to pay tax on rising share prices unless you sell.    I recommended you keep half in the bank, because you never know when you'll need it.  If you sell a dividend stock lower than you bought it, you'll realize a loss, but if you hold it, in 20 or so years time it will probably be higher and you would have accumulated a dividend return on investment.    If you're disiplined, this is a great way to progressively develop a second income.|`|5o77AWAAaa	I found an article you should read.

sB9xp8wraa	There are two different kinds of bankruptcy, Chapter 13, where they consolidate your debts and set up a payment plan, and Chapter 7, where your debts are forgiven, with some exceptions, student loans being one of them. Thanks to the Credit Card companies, it's a lot harder to file for Chapter 7, but you can still do it.    The last information I got on Chapter 7 is that you can file every 3 years, but the filing will stay on your credit report for 10 years.     The law may have changed, so your best bet is to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to find out the latest information.|`|jVmUjzbiaa	Caspper,  You have your whole life ahead of you.

If your debts are strictly credit cards (no student loans) then they can be wiped out completely. A chapter 7 does stay on your credit report for 10 years, though you should be able to work on rebuilding your credit in the meantime.|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	If the Bankruptcy is approved, it will stay on your credit report for 10 years.

(Assuming you started work at 16-18 years old, you have only been working 20 or so years, we won't be able to draw social security until we are in our 80s, if at all).    Go for it!  Just realize that the medical "shortage" is quickly becoming a bogus thing, just like tech jobs.  There are no shortages and many medical jobs are being laid off or cheaper working foreigners brought in.    Good luck|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Of course not!

AA11284831	Did you continue working at the same physical location in VA?  IF so you will NOT allocate your earnings for VA.  You will file a part-year return in VA but list ALL income on it.    You'll then file a part-year return in WV and allocate your wages on the WV return since WV can only tax your earnings once you became a resident.  They will give you a credit for the taxes you paid to VA.

Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    Since you are under the age of 19 and living at home, you are a dependent of your parents.  By law, they are the only ones that can claim you.  Also, you will continue to be a dependent until you reach the age of 24 if you are a full time student for some part of at least five months of the year.    Even if they do not claim you on their return, you cannot claim your own personal exemption.    Of the money that you paid in taxes, only the federal and the state count.  The FICA and med are social security taxes.  This is your contribution to your social security that you will receive once you retire.  These taxes must be paid by everyone and there is no way to get them back.    Also, because of your age, you can't qualify for earned income credit (EIC).    Hope this helps.

This is how the government encourages people to have children - by letting them claim you as a dependent.|`|AA11284831	The tax benefit can range from $0 to several thousand dollars.  No way to say without knowing all of their tax information.    Compared to what they probably pay in taxes, your $1,200 is a pee-hole in the snow.  And compared to the quarter mil or so that it takes to raise a kid to age 18, the tax benefit is not even a pee-hole.|`|fUFQM7Ocaa	Yeah they get a lot more for claiming you...but i think once you turn 18 you can let the tax people know that your parents are not to claim you anymore!!!|`|K7x1RHVFaa	I will make it simple for you.  Only part of the 1200 was federal taxes withheld.     Assuming you made 8600, your standard deduction was 5450, leaving 3150 taxable, which is 318 in taxes saying that you paid 518 in taxes paid to leave you with a 200 dollar rebate.    If you had been able to use your standard deduction and your personal exemption you would not have had a taxable income and the full 518 dollars would be returned to you as 8950 is greater than 8600.    As to the question of how much your parents benefit, remember that the more you make the higher the percentage they tax you at. You are being taxed at the minumum. The maximum is more than three times that much.    I will give you a concrete example. Your exemption is worth 3500 dollars in taxable income. If your parents made 100,000 this would reduce that to 96,500. which is a married tax difference of 862 dollars instead of the 318 dollar single person difference you experienced. this is getting the biggest bang for your deduction.    I hope this helped.    Good Luck.|`|tw44fqCpaa	If if your parents didn't claim you at your age you are considered a dependent and still can't claim yourself.  IRS rules.  They get an additional "exemption" which lowers their taxable income by 3500 plus some other credits possibly.  You are not getting screwed - you live free while they support you and the IRS knows that so why should you get the tax benefit instead of them.      Your total withholding is not relevant.  Social security and medicare are never refundable.  Your federal income tax withholding is what you want to look at (box 2 of your W2).  If you made 8600 last year your tax liability should be approx.  318 so anything more in box 2 would be refunded to you.

rsYn5G01aa	In my opinion hell yes! But I am also a nursing student. :)  Who else gets the opportunity to care for people at their weakest hour, support and comfort both their patient and the patient's family. Nurses make a direct impact on people's lives everyday. I in all honesty can't think of anything more respectable than a mother or a nurse.   And a nurse is far from stupid, they make critical decision on a daily basis, time manage, prioritize, show compassion and have a vast knowledge of disease processes,medications, communication and new technology and procedures.  As another person stated, anyone who laughs or says anything negative about your dreams  is a hater, their opinion should be discounted and quickly.|`|AA11712728	Unfortunately that stigma around nursing does exist. It is an under appreciated profession.  But nurses are the hardest working individuals in the hospital.  Sometimes, they spend more time with the patient than the doctors do.  And nursing school, oh boy, it takes 2-3 years, but those will be the most grueling 2-3 years of your life.  Its pretty tough and mentally draining.  You can't really appreciate nursing until you get sick or you become one.  I used to be one of those 'pfft' people when I was in high school, but look at me now, 1 year left in nursing school to become a nurse..  If you want to be a nurse, go for it.  Don't worry about what other people will think.  If you want to become one, then you owe it to yourself.  Don't let other people's words and opinions put you down.. Wish you all the best of luck:)|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	People who have that "pfft" view of nurses really are ignorant to the level of education RNs receive, and are ignorant to the complexity of the profession and what the job entails.     Anyone with any knowledge of the medical industry knows who the REAL caregivers are and who "runs the show" in the hospital - it's the nurses. We are the ones there on the front lines, doctors are only there at a patient's bedside for 5 minutes a day. We are the ones making sure people don't die, making sure they are educated about their condition and how to care for themselves and improve their health and well being.     If you are drawn to nursing, don't listen to the naysayers. Be an advocate for your career and use the opportunity to become a champion for the profession and put these people in their place.|`|f52fc4f706a5d932f2a7ba4e6d13b0d4aa	Lawyers only get paid well if certain conditions are in their favor--if they graduated in top 10%, right location, know the right people, and where they went to school. Otherwise (like most of them do), they'll make like $70k, which isn't bad at all, just realize, they'll be making the same as a lot of nurses.     And psychologist? It doesn't take much to get a psychology degree as it does to actually get a job in psychology. You spend all your time and money to get your phD in psych and then get $80k, at best. Usually you'll have to end up teaching it at a college or something because jobs in the work field are pretty scarce. Psychologist seem to be the "pfft" career all out all of them. Psychologists are wanna-be psychiatrists who are too lazy to go through med school.    Anyways, nursing is a very great idea! Some doctors even look down on nurses, you'll realize that when you get into it. Don't let it discourage you. Remember, no one can get to you unless you allow them to. Good luck! :)|`|Zs2lUCI4aa	Nurse is very HOT, and difficult to get in Nurse in California.

Anyone who scoffs at you when you tell them your hopes and dreams is not respectable. This goes for anything.

We are moving from a mechanical age to an electric/electronic age in transportation.  Soon an automobile won't have an engine, rather an electric motor, no transmission, but single speed interfaces between the motors and wheels, no ignition, but electronic controls for the all electric components.    This is going to be a serious transformation and a lot of today's mechanics are not going to be able to make the shift.

This engineer designs and test a part, seeing that it meets all its requirements (i.e. the shock), performs as required, material meets desired durability and so on.

You know that to be a rocket scientist, a doctor, a brick layer, a construction worker, an office worker, a teacher there are prerequisites, things you must learn, before you can be successful, you don't just jump right in unprepared.    The same applies to the Internet marketing industry even though there are unsavory people out there who'd have you believe it's a "Walk in the Park" and requires no more than the belief that you can just do it.    And I'll have to admit, it is a walk in the park compared to what you have to put up with in the working world punching a clock being a subordinate to someone who does not have your interests in mind, but there are still rules you have to follow and pitfalls you must avoid to actually make Internet marketing work for you.    Most people will not make a dime online and yet there are others who will make more in one month than most people make in a whole year. Why is that?    My answer begins with the age-old chicken or egg question, "what comes first the chicken or the egg"? Personally I vote for, well never mind, each argument you or I make comes back to the same old conclusion - I have no clue and I don't think many of us do either.    But one thing I do have a clue about and know for sure is that to make money online you must first have Passion for the company products and/or service of any Internet business from which you expect to make money.    Passion in this sense simply means that you've researched and like the company and products or services. It is then that you translate that like (or Passion) into the education, excitement and work that usually accompany Passion.    I will have to say that many online entrepreneurs are so good at what they do that they ignore passion because they can sell anything. But I'm concerned about those of you who are not so knowledgeable at working an online business successfully.    Now, I'm not trying to make anyone believe that Passion is the only thing necessary. Because to be successful you must also have a good website, good marketing, widespread advertising, company support, effective keywords, and etc. Those things are often learned from the company you join - but sidestep Passion and you reduce your chances for success dramatically.    It therefore follows that, if you have no Passion for the company and the products and services provided by that company, again, you won't attempt to do the work you are being taught.    Internet marketing work is typically not all that difficult or time consuming but it does take motivation caused by Passion to get you off and running with a sustained effort so that you won't stumble.    You have a great resource in the Internet search engines to search about the Internet Marketing industry for business opportunities, USE IT!    Your research should uncover a company that you like and have confidence in. It should be solid, founded on great principles, and easy to understand with great products and services that are sell-able for which you can have Passion. If you don't find it move on,  You can find the right opportunity containing the attributes identified above.    Comments like, well, that one sounds good and the compensation plan is excellent so I guess I'll start that business - does not sound like a decision based on anything near Passion. And remember when you hear that an Internet "guru" does that, don't be tempted, because as I said earlier they are experienced and can sell just about anything, without being Passionate about the company products and services.    Note: By the way it's your goal to get to the point where you can sell about anything online. That end skill and goal is a worthy one indeed.    Remember, there are other steps you must make before you step into Internet Marketing but if you don't first find the right company products and services to be passionate about, all of those other steps may just cause you a lot of frustration instead of bringing you great success.    Not being Passionate about a company and products and services that has market proof that it will sell is a pitfall you simply must avoid.|`|DorePwVOaa	Good luck. Honestly, I've been doing different things to try and make money online for the past two years, and I only make about $150 a month now... after 2 years of work. It's hard - harder than it is to make that much money in "the real world." It takes more time and effort, and there are a lot of scams out there. If you're going to do something online, make it something you're interested in, rather than going after what you think will make you a lot of money. You'll get more "bang" for your time than chasing dollars that aren't really there.|`|KYWa9EtNaa	Actually there are many ways to make money online and honestly I have spent years trying ways to make money online and I started with having a blog.

Auction/sell off your personal goods that you don't want on websites such as Amazon or Ebay.    2. Stock market. "Technically" it is online since you can buy and purchase stocks/bonds/mutual funds online. However, how much money you make is really up to you on this one.

And yes, they would take it out of your refund if they do not get the money before hand.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	It is better to wait so that you know what IRS found wrong on your 2007 tax return, and you do not repeat this on 2008 tax return.    If on 2007 tax return you had shown everything correctly, then why IRS says you owe $2000. They should have asked for some additional papers to confirm your status, wages, deductions and dependents.  Anyway, do not miss IRS dates as it amounts to agreeing to what IRS says.

But it's still important for you to file on time.  You have until April 15th.  Try to get this problem resolved before then.    Just curious - how could the auditor not account for your three kids,  if they were on your original return?
