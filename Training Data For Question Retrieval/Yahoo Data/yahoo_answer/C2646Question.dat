20090204170945AAArDyt	Pets;Dogs	Information on raw feeding, please?	We currently have our dogs on Blue Buffalo Small Breed kibble. I would like to maybe do raw feeding sometimes, but I'm not sure how to go about doing it. I know my dogs would have no problem eating it (I've slipped them a little raw beef before while I was making meatballs), but I don't want to make them sick by giving them too much.      We have 2 Boston Terriers (about 20 lbs each) and one Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound crossbreed (about 10 lbs.) As far as we know, none of them have allergies to any food.       How much would each of them be fed a day?      What meats are ok for them to eat? I would be wary of feeding raw pork or chicken because of the effects it has on humans. Do these apply to dogs?      Where would we get it from?      What is the ratio of kibble-meat-veggies to feed?      Any information you have on this would be absolutely awesome. Thank you in advance.

He hasn't had any other symptoms, pain, scooting, nothing.   Nor has he had any problems with this before. Is this his anal glands?

20090204184801AA4WBeK	Pets;Horses	I was thinking yesterday about show etiquette?	I've seen a few stupid people at shows.....    scenario one:  Some young children are warming up their horses and they ride in a long huge band together this makes it very difficult for other riders to overtake either on the inside or outside of them...    scenario two:  some children don't understand that when a group of people are riding or warming up there is usually a certain way the traffic is going yet people still decide to travel the opposite way (i have seen many collision happen this way!)    scenario three:  young children using spurs and crops  and they are clearly showing the WRONG WAY repeatedly of how to use these artificial aids!!!!    Why on earth should a child be using them ?    and if you think it's ok then why on earth should a child have a horse that NEEDS THIS??  personally i thinks it's very a very very stupid and immature idea either via the parents or child (depending on age)    scenario four:  people showing animal abuse right infront of onlookers    not only is it cruel but incredibly stupid aswell    i saw a young girl only 13yrs old   she had a young green broke horse   she had this horse at the show after riding him and failing tremandesouly she rubbed him down rugged him up  threw her helmet and left it in the horses yard  the young horse started chewing the inside of the helmet   tore out the foam   she came back to find she would need to buy another one    the mother went balistic at her then the horse  thus giving her daughter a crop and told her to catch him and wack him with the crop untill he coward   roughly 7 people were watching this.    what do you think ???      Have you had any horrible or stupid advice at shows or seen something stupid or have any issues with etiquette.

20060626130946AAkxj6c	Pets;Cats	How do I get my cat to play without biting!?	I have an adult, male cat- I also have three children, 5 and under (and another due in 5 weeks).  My cat was neutered and declawed when I got him at five months old.  He is now one.  He is a great cat, very loving and affectionate, however he does "attack" my husband and I, and our children (they seem to catch most of it).  His intentions are to play, and he hasn't hurt anyone, but I'm afraid he could.  Plus, it's just annoying.  Occasionally he'll do it without any provokation.  Anyone know why he does this? Can anyone tell me how to teach him a better way to play- especially with the children!

Are male pups worth more than females & are dapples worth more than solids?? Also, at what age should my female be before I let her mate? by the way, she hasn't been in heat yet so I don't know if she's "late". and I was told to let her experience her 1st heat before she mates because she won't understand what's happening to her.
