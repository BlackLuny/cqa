20090309120805AA7bXzQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Which Flute should I purchase?	I use to play in high school, but I never really took it seriously, I just liked to play.  After 5 years of not playing, I have decided to get into it again.  The flute I had then was used when i bought it and never really sounded the best, so I want to invest in a better instrument in hopes that it will motivate me to keep playing.      My current flute has open keys and the low b key as well, so I would prefer that my new on also had these specifications.  I want a good quality instrument that sounds good, but I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.  I know it will  not be cheap but I still want to be as thrifty as possible.      Specific suggestions are welcome, and I would also greatly appreciate any links to websites that either have discussions about different flutes or websites that have actual instrument descriptions, etc.        Thanks in advanced for all the help!  I sincerely appreciate it!

We get along well at the moment, and we are friends, but, I've known her for 7 months so far, and I really want to become better friends. I still feel like I'm in that phase where you're trying to avoid scaring them off, before you become comfortable enough to constantly joke around. I heard that Cancers and Virgos get along beautifully, so what's the deal here? Am I always going to feel awkward with her, or do you think we have the potential to actually become good friends instead of just friends?      Her birthday is July 8th, and mine is September 14. I was born at around 12:30pm, but I don't know about her.       Any advice?      Thanks guys!

20090309125709AAgK2jO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Who are some of the great performers who declined with age, or who went through major "down" phases?	Two years ago my piano teacher gave me a list of performers to listen to (most of which were amazing), and in it he wrote "young Yehudi Menuhin." So I figured that Menuhin somehow declined as he aged, but that may just be my teacher's opinion. I still haven't listened to enough to judge. I was just listening to his recording (with Oistrakh) of Bach's double concerto, though, and it reminded me of this. Do you think it's true? Was Menuhin better when he was young?      And are there any great performers who declined over time (sad thought!), or who went through phases?

I always get mad at the song Live Your Life when she sings "take a walk in my shoes. and see the way I'm living if you realy want to." but how can she expect anyone to believe her life is so bad if she's basically making it that way? She's just setting him up to beat her back up again and maybe the next time she will finally leran.. because this wasn't the first time.

20090227152552AAWRsKS	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Noise Song For Friday #101 (Buttons and Whatnot)?	F**k everything, especially buttons. And they drone on...and on and on and on. I surmise you all will show enough patience for this duo. Yes...patience will suffice (and a lot of it). When listening remember: instant gratification is far from this band's mind; instead more of a whisper, "Follow us, we will show you the way and take you on a mind-enhancing trip." What the band lacks in 'poppiness' or a hook, they definitely make up for in a profound way with the presence of these delightful drones. Oddly enough, the noises do not overpower one another, melding very nicely into an overwhelmingly enjoyable eight and a half minutes.       http://www.last.fm/music/****+Buttons/_/...       So...?

Any plans this weekend? :)      Today I'm featuring The Melvins, a totally underrated and very influential band. They are considered one of the 'godfathers' of grunge and had a huge influence on Nirvana, Soundgarden, and other Seattle grunge bands, plus Tool, Mastodon, and Crowbar. Check out my favorite song from the band:      'Honey Bucket'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzHZrts80...       So what do you think, R&P?      BQ: Isn't it ridiculous how much people care about Kurt Cobain's death?    I'm absolutely tired of it. The poor guy has been dead for nearly 15 years, let him rest in peace.    You can't bring him back to life. So get a life yourself. It's unfortunate that people care more about his death than his career with Nirvana. Let's celebrate the music!   BQ2: Any suggestions for upcoming songs of the day? It would be nice if you posted a link to a 90s song, but anything is welcome, especially if it's underrated.

20090227152816AAzyuao	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: How do you sneeze?	I'm trying to find all the ways people sneeze, out of randomness. If none of the descriptions apply, what is your sneeze like?      1. The ladylike, high pitched "mouse" sneeze      2. The loud sneeze, and you usually make sounds leading up to it to warn everybody that hell is going to break loose      3. The second loud sneeze, but there are no sounds leading up to it and it comes out of nowhere and all you hear is ACHOOO! (This is the "GOD BLESS YOU" sneeze)      4. The Machine gun sneeze: you never sneeze once at a time even if you're not sick.  You do like 7 in a matter of 10 seconds      5. The Choo sneeze.  There's no AH to the CHOO, so you just CHOO      6. The cough sneeze, sounds just like a cough so you can't tell if you need to tell the person "Bless you" or not.      7. The ACHOOOAOHLAHEORHA sneeze.  After the achoo you like to display your misery by making a whole bunch of other moans and groans that are otherwise necessary       I'm #6 and I do #7 when I'm sick and no one's around.

My mom ordered me these Twilight rubber bracelets and one says "Team Edward" and there are other ones that say "Team Jacob".  I was showing them to my friend and she said that eventually all the girls at our school would slowly divide into the two teams.  Then there would be a big fight on the blacktop during lunch to determine the better team, kinda like a mob war.  I pictured all the Team Edward girls lined up, crouching, and hissing the way vampires do.  Then, across from us, the girls on Team Jacob were on all fours and growling like werewolves.  Then we charge and the teachers wouldn't be able to stop us because there are too many of us.  Then eventually we would have to unite to fight against the S.W.A.T. Team   :)      I've been playing the scene all day in my head!

20090227150957AAL4itY	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Attn: Psychics and Astrologers--Taurus/Gemini Cusp and Scorpio Compatability?	Hello, my name is Georgia and I was born on May 21, 1989 at 7:42pm in Houston, Texas. Within the past week I have come in contact with a man named Dustin who was born on November 7, 1984 and we have been communicating with each other and creating a strong and intense bond, one that I have never experienced before and feel like he understands me for who I am and the things in life that were missing in the previous relationship that I experienced, and the dreams and ideals that I have for the future. My question is a question of faith since most astrological texts have doomed us and I feel disappointed because I am going into this with all my heart and truly want us to work out but I don't know if this is meant to be and is it reciprical? Is it possible I have found my soulmate because I really feel that way.

I am a big fan of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby etc. I prefer the old style of singing to the contemporary styles of Harry Connick Jr and Michael Buble. Many people tell me I sing well. How can I go about being discovered since there don't seem to be many nightclubs around like the ones Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby sang in when they were young?      2. I often TRY to record my singing with the recorder built into my computer, but it always makes my voice sound terrible. Why is this and will recording equipment (capacitor microphone etc.) help me? If so, where can I find it?

20090309150257AAdKnEf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Noise Song For Monday #111 (library two)?	Sorry everyone, but it's another by the Velvets. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but, hey, aren't we all a bit biased when it comes tou our favorite band? Anyway...      By 1969, John Cale had been sacked from the Velvet Underground, as well as the majority of the music's avant-garde quality (which had become the infamy of what was the Velvet Underground). "Mr. Pop", Doug Yule had been recruited from a local band by Lou and took the role of bass and vocals ("Who Loves the Sun" anybody?) Their third record, a self-titled effort, showcased a drastically different side of these musicians, especially with Lou Reed and his songwriting, which was at its most honest and vulnerable. This of course, was due to the fact that Cale had left and taken the vanguard with him. Long gone. Some may say they lost their originality and gave in to a more commercial sound. Yet, amongst these accessible numbers, there lies the penultimate track. the murder mystery. Line upon line upon line of uncompromising, free flowing, unaware, unconscious poetry. Succulent smooth. Skewer the sieve of optical sewer. Sterling's hard monotone clashing with Lou's halted reading. Maureen's innocent, almost child-like, voice. Inverse. Obverse. Cascade. wagon.       http://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Unde...     http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/T...       So...?
20090309143810AAYPQ7V	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Who came the hardest on the mic in their hip hop career M.O.P. or Onyx?	LOL...This debatable! I loved both groups. I remember the M.O.P. World Famous album. and Rugged Neva Smoove (D.J. Premier remix), How about some hardcore track,etc. Onyx's Throw ya Gunz,Slam, Slam Harder, All we got iz us(Evil Streets), Raise it up, etc. If they were to M.C. Battle and let them go toe to toe and perform freestyle, written, or even their own recorded songs against each other. In other words an all out arsenal on each other who would win?

20090309150210AAC8Z1x	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Who makes the best beats as a D.J. for hip hop tracks D.J. Premier or Pete Rock?	Don't sleep on Pete Rock, he has those mesmerizing sounds of an old soul style. I remember  the Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth album, the one with "I got a Love",and "Sun won't come out", and so many others of his like "When they reminisce over you"... Mad Sick! He still makes sick beats. D.J. Premier got his own thang too. He always had that hard street beat, I think my favorite D.J. Premier beat was on "Supastar" by Group Home in 1995. It sounded like a space age sound meets hardcore street sound. I was like Damn! This is a beat! Still to this day, one of the best hip hop beats I ever heard in my life. Word!

20090309145053AAkDxK6	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What Harold Lloyd film is this?	It was a silent film, obviously, and it featured Harold's character who tried to get to a wedding in time to stop the girl he loved from marrying this other guy. I clicked in at the part where he is talking to the girl that he loves but then he leaves with some other woman. Later on he sees the girl in the newspaper in the wedding announcement. So he goes through all these troubles to get to the wedding like stealing cars, a cop's motorcycle, a trolley, horses, etc. He gets to the wedding just when the man is about to place the ring on her finger. He stops the wedding and he and the girl run away and he asks her to marry him and she says yes.          I checked imdb, but there are so many works that I have no idea which one it is. I think it's just a short film, but I'm not sure.

They're a modern rock band, and I'm pretty sure they're still around   They make around twenty minute songs.  The songs are mostly instrumentals, but they have some singing every so often.   They're kinda "Christian rock", but nothing Christian enough to be played on Christian radio stations.  I'm pretty sure the leader sing left his own band and started this band to get a more Christian sound going.      It's a bit progressive rock, a bit like the Fall of Troy.      I think they're name is something like "Needle spore" or "Needle score" or something like that...  Can you help me?

20090309141917AAYIyvZ	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	(Tokio Hotel fans) Do you think Bill is...?	Sexy or Beautiful? I know you're going to choose both, but if you HAD to choose one. ONE. Please not both, we all know he's everything to us. =)       Here's my opinion on this: (copy-pasted from my last answer)      He's BEAUTIFUL. An angel that has descended from heaven. With his flawless face, glamorous feline eyes, perfect jawline and nose, how could he not be beautiful? The way he poses, the way he talks, the way his glorious smile lights up the room could all break every girls' heart that he passes by. He has broken my heart as well as many others I'm sure. If you ever have the change to meet him, I'm sure you'd be gazing with your jaw dropped at his breathtaking demeanor. It's like looking right into a younger, better looking Greek god. It's like standing right in front of the sun. Even the presence of him in a room same as you is heartaching because you know you can't ever be as beautiful as him.       Haha. I'd love to hear your opinions on this as long as it's not a hate comment. ^_^

20090309142219AACsKGm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Sound imperfections on Katy Lied?	Allegedly, there were some sound imperfections on the album "Katy Lied" by Steely Dan.  These imperfections were due to a malfunction with the DBX noise reduction system.        Does anyone notice anything on the recordings?  The only thing that I can pick up on is very very discrete reverb on most of the tracks, and having much reverb is very unusual for Steely Dan.        Also on "Everyone's Gone To The Movies", There is that almost percussive sounding rainstick that is consistent throughout the whole track.  My only thought is that is not meant to be and is only a sound imperfection, but quite a large one.  I would never publish the track if that were the case.      Any thoughts?

20090309145821AA97xTu	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	My singing voice. Need Opinions?	I like to sing a lot of classic rock stuff, but I think as far as voice is concerned I always wanted that powerful, soulful, gospel kind of voice. Like when your singing high notes they don't sound light but heavy. Like Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Robert Plant, Roger Daultrey, Steven Tyler, Freddie Mercury, etc. They all can hit high notes, aside from vedder since he's baritone, but they have a voice that's loud and heavy, like even though they're 20 something they sound like they're 30 or 40 something. I just want a more brash and layered voice, because right now I kind of sound like young voice and an old voice mixed together. It's very strange.      Here's a video. I messed up on the solo and it's the only video copy I have. I was trying to sing it in a vedder-ish sort of voice and I can sing higher than that. I just don't particularly like the sound of my voice. Any criticism or advice would help. Thank you.      btw it is a pink floyd song.

20090309150651AATt8nG	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Is anybody selling, or know anybody who is selling tickets to see The Prodigy in Cardiff on April 5th?	My friend and I are desperate to go to this gig but we found out a little too late about The Prodigy's tour. We've been looking for days for tickets going for their original face value and have so far only found one on eBay, a site we're a little hesitant about, but there's no Buy It Now option so bidders will most likely raise the price to possibly even the hundreds.      So, is anybody selling, or does anyone know of people wishing to sell at least two tickets to see The Prodigy in Cardiff on April 5th for their face value? It doesn't matter if they're seated or standing - but if they're seated I would at least like them to be 'together', if you know what I mean. I don't want to us to be separated and put on different balconies.      If someone is selling two tickets but for a higher price, perhaps we can come to a compromise?

20090309152434AAzPcJi	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	In regards to the new manga chapter 438 in bleach...?	Ichigo is not dead, I have heard so many people say o he's screwed he cannot beat Ulquiorra, people he is the main protagonist in this show he is not going to die.  He may be beat right now but this has happened soo many times to him, for instance when he was getting his *** kicked against Renji and Zenpachi he had to learn more about Zangetsu and have the will to fight.  His hollowfication form is new to him, he only went through stamina training he doesn't know much about his bankai either.  There is a lot more to his hallowfication form for instance Shinji Hirako shot out cero at Grimmjow and Grimmjow was in shock when he did this.  Not to mention the espada can create a portal from the human world into hueco mundo, so who is to say that the vizards wouldn't be able to do the same?  What if the vizards come and save ichigo.  There are so many things that could happen but a lot of people are saying ichigo's screwed he's dead.  No that wouldn't be an option since he is the protagonist and this situation happens to him all of the time where he faces a near death experience.  What do you think and nothing about Ichigo being dead please.

20090309135546AAn2vra	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Deleted Scenes from the Twilight DVD!!!?	Access Hollywood recently aired three deleted scenes from the Twilight DVD and i thought they were pretty awesome! The first one they aired was pretty good but kind of out of character for Edward when Bella let him bite her finger. The second one was pretty weird but wouldn't really fit in the movie. And the third one was kind of a little freaky during the scene where Bella though she dreamed of Edward but in the Deleted scene instead of him leaving, Bella wakes up and sees him and grab him and started kissing him. It was pretty weird. What did you think of all three of the deleted scenes so far on Access Hollywood?

I can't watch the shows when they are on, so I love love love that abc.com, nbc.com, and cbs.com have full episodes online. I'm afraid that a lot of people are doing this now, and they're not taking these into consideration when they figure out which shows to cancel (Pushing Daisies, for example, shouldn't have been cancelled!).

Any-who, I didn't find Kate Winslet's acting all that impressive. I thought she did much more and much better acting in "Titanic", or even "The LIfe of David Gale".    Is it fair to say that the main reason she received an Academy Award for this film is because she was brave enough to show her who-ha?  When Halle Barry showed hers in "Monster's Ball" she won that year as well.        I wish there was more of a plot to this movie, and less porn.  I certainly could have done without seeing a teenage boy completely naked (package from the front and the back ew) .  Thoughts?

A military cargo plane, flying over a populated area, suddenly loses power and starts to nose down. The pilot tries to pull up, but with all their cargo, the plane is too heavy. So he yells to the soldiers in back to throw things out to make the plane lighter. They throw out a pistol. "Throw out more!" shouts the pilot. So they throw out a rifle. "More!" he cries again. They heave out a missile, and the pilot regains control.      He pulls out of the dive and lands safely at an airport. They get into a jeep and drive off. Pretty soon they meet a boy on the side of the road who's crying. They ask him why he's crying and he says "A pistol hit me on the head!"      They drive more and meet another boy who's crying even harder. Again they ask why and the boy says, "A rifle hit me on the head!"      They apologize and keep driving. They meet a boy on the sidewalk who's laughing hysterically. They ask him, "Kid, what's so funny?" The boy replies, "I sneezed and a house blew up!"

He sang of far off places   Of laughter and of fun,      It seemed his very trilling,   brought up the morning sun.      I stirred beneath the covers   Crept slowly out of bed,      Then gently shut the window   And crushed his ******* head.      I'm not a morning person!

20090309175027AAvL6Ej	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Your true opinion of Miley Cyrus?  Dont try to be cool... be truthful?	I posted a stupid random lyric from her song just to see what people said. in only 5 minutes i got 17 negative responses about her.   But sometimes i wonder if people are just trying to be cool saying they hate her.... she is HUGE, i mean really huge, sells out concerts millionns and millions of people go to them, watch her movies, buy her merchandise, all ages.  Yes, we know her voice isnt the greatest.. but it is unique in its own way. its rough... but she can still hit some pretty high notes even though its rocky. and its still different and unique...  and she's very popular.      I noticed on her youtube videos a lot of negative stuff as well. I think people comment the video's rudely just to be cool... becuz.. if they really didnt like her, why would they be on her video's to begin with?  Like.. I really hate Beyonce...  so i would never go and watch her videos. why waste my time watching a video that pisses me off or makes me angry?      When i was in high school Britney spears was HUGE.  but everyone in the hallways, and gossip, all said bad things about her.  But some of them i knew as good friends and when we got home, we'd race to watch her video's and secretly had tickets to her concert.   I think its the same with Miley. It's all about being cool and not letting people know you actually like her.  she seems like a well rounded girl, she's not slutty and skanky... she's a normal teenager that some photos got leaked out.. .all teens do it, u see their myspaces. its just becuz miley's famous that she gets it blown out of porportion.   And her voice isnt horrible... ashley simpson is horrible... she cant hit any note at all.  Miley does what she does, and she's very big in entertainment. I've watched Hannah Montana, and honestly, i laugh my butt off sometimes. she's funny! she plays her own instruments, writes music, acts, she's all around talented and unique.    She's no celine dion, but that doesnt mean she cant make some fun songs.   and she's really big.      so everyone who secretly likes her but wants to be cool:   stop commenting bad comments about her on peoples pages. there is just no need. keep it to yourself. and if you truley truley do no tlike her, stop answering questions about her, and stop watching her videos.          so what do u all think truley and honestly about Miley Cyrus?

20090309123812AAyPQni	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you know thw name of this movie?	Does anyone remember a fictional movie that was made during the late 80's or early 90's about a man whose twin was attached to his side, and they lived in a house where a funny and strange lady took care of them and other people who were considered (real) "freaks"?  I remember the twin that was attached to the side of his brother, his body was only made up of a head, neck, shoulders, arms, and hands, and he had a really bad attitude.  The other twin got so mad at him that he took a knife and cut him off, and carried him around in a picnic basket, but then missed having him around and so he sewed him back on to his body.  As gross as it sounds the movie was meant to be funny, and it was.  I saw it when I was a kid and now I can't remember the name of it.  I know it aired on HBO a lot.

20090309180723AA9oXTv	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Guys, check me on this. Have you ever done this after you pee?	I absolutely hate it when I think I have finished peeing, and after I place my unit back in my underpants, I feel the small trickle of last remaining drops flow out onto my underpants. It's not like I'm peeing my pants, but it's just that there were a few remaining drops that I didn't know were there or that I couldn't shake out.       So the questions is, after you urinate, have you ever dabbled the tip of your penis with toilet paper to make sure that you don't have anymore urine left. Or if you're a bit extreme like me, have you ever wrapped some toilet paper around your penis to make sure that, if there is any urine left, the TP will soak it up and you can discard of it later on.       Am I crazy, or is this some unspoken ritual that some men do occasionally. Please tell me I'm not the only one.

On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin."       "What?" said the puzzled groom.       "How can that be if you've been married ten times?"       "Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.       Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.       Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.       Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.       Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.       Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.       Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.       Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.       Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.       Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"       "Good," said the new husband, "but, why?"       "You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!"

20090309175324AAp2P9s	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	A shounen anime with a cute main character (similar to kuroshituji) NO romance?	Okay well I really like Kuroshitsuji, espacially ceil and I want something similar to it.   I want the anime or manga, to be shounen,and if you can find any I want one with like a kid as main charcter, it doesn't have to like the main main character but you know like appear in every episode.    I was also hoping for something like a master to servant relationship if you can find one.   I want it to be fantasy but if there's one that's like insanely good but it's not fantasy then that's alright.   But if you can't find anything similar to than then I would like a shounen ai anime/manga.   The character's have to look hot (no yaoi) or cute or both. Also there has to be one character that's kind of weak and really cute. then the other charcter has to be tough and hot.    But, agian, if you can't find anything like those two then I want something with a cute main character, has to be shounen, of course, and it could be slashable.   GIVE DESCRIPTION AND TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND IT ONLINE FOR FREE

20090309181209AAXYQ9a	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

I have an Ibanez right now, but it doesn't really hold up to my style of playing, so I'm hoping on getting something a lot nicer. I play a lot of groove and funk (red hot chili peppers, Primus etc.) and I slap a lot. Right now, I am debating over a Musicman Stingray and a Warwick Corvette $$. I need something really punchy and low, and I just want some peoples opinions on what would be better for me to get. Thanks.

It's a man's voice and he is singing about how some song is bringing back memories of him and this girl. It makes him feel like they should get back together- "like it used to be". The song has like trumpets in it, I think. There was a part in the song where it like stopped and he sighs, then it comes back.

There's two things I know for sure   She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's little girl   As I drop to my knees by her bed at night   She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes   And I thank God for all of the joy in my life   Oh, but most of all for..      Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer   Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair   "Walk beside the pony Daddy, it's my first ride   I know the cake looks funny Daddy but I sure tried"   Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right   To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night      Sweet sixteen today   And she's lookin' like her mamma a little more every day   One part woman, the other part girl   To perfume and make-up, from ribbons and curls   Trying her wings out in a great big world   But I remember...      Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer   Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair   You know how much I love you Daddy   But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time   Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right   To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night      Oh the precious times   Oh, like the wind the years go by   Precious butterfly   Spread your wings and fly      She'll change her name today   and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away   Standing in the bride room just staring at her   She asked me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not sure,   I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl"   And she leaned over...and gave me...      Butterfly kisses with her mamma there   Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair   "Walk me down the aisle Daddy, it's just about time   Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy? Daddy don't cry"   Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right   To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses      I couldn't ask God for more   Man, this is what love is   I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always remember   Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses
