0d11d9baa89a8a31e162ca3959de0150aa	Just be honest with him. tell him why you want to break up. tell him what he has done wrong.  if you want him to change and keep him give him a couple of months to change his ways. if that still doesnt work then you just find someone who will treat you better (as you want to be treated and talked to).  though the kind of thing you are talking about "dirty talk" for want of a better phrase, is normal some people like it others like you don't. Telling someone what you want to do with them issupposed to turn your partner on. however sadly this in your case seems to be having the opposite effect.  So all you can do is talk out why this upsets or disturbs you enough to want to break up with the guy in question, or talk to a professional to see if there is something in your past affecting your response to this kind of smut.    good luck.    all the above assuming this is a genuine case and not a joke to waste time.
AA10413142	If he really likes you and is mature then his friend cannot interfere with your relationship.     He may still like you but the only way to know is to see how he responds to you when you speak to him.     Don't ask him if he still likes you, just start a conversation with him and work from there.|`|mBZUf4wgaa	well when he has a grilfriend the guy who broke you and ur boy friend  brake them up just like him|`|5d73b153670425c028538ee2a612fa54aa	obviously not if he allowed his friend to break you guys up, if it were my friend i would have told him to mind his own damn business..
AA10837051	Hi, well this is friend's job, you know you should do something and it's not looking for a new friends of course, well, I think you should take her to some resturant and talk to her honestly about what you think and let her remeber that you r saying this bcoz you care about her not bcoz u r jealous of her (as she may think), and if she say that she can't control her self make a deal with her to make her notice that she is doing a wronge thing, you sound such a nice person and I hope you could help your friend
f1d34Zmkaa	normal!! i think girls should be able to make the first move sometimes..it perfectly ok with me|`|eslJeEUaaa	Yes you should talk to the,  And we would talk back to you.|`|AOvCeJAcaa	alright, as a 20 year old guy, i would have to say that i love when girls come up and just start talking...if i'm in the mood to flirt around - a girl making the first move can be pretty cool - if i want to hang with my buds i'd say hi and keep the convo short...either way you lose nothing by going up to them - its complimenting them, so they won't mind|`|OYGIjxo5aa	1st of all! show off in front of them! grab a pool toy and throw it in their direction and ask if they could get it and then ask if they want to play and then go for it! lol|`|Vq5jhyS1aa	show off infront of them. but don't go over board! Be suttle but make sure they notice. Get a pool ball or something and play volleyball with your friend then if there is a hottub and the boys get in then get in a few minutes after them and start a conversation with them or if you hear them talking about (this is cheezy) a concert or something then say you saw that and star a conversation about it.|`|aaXT3HXNaa	Depends on what you look like
VEzQ4jWGaa	next time he trys to open up hold his hand and smile at him nand tell him not to be shy!|`|XJq2fUkyaa	If you feel the same way towards him, tell him first, that will take the pressure off and he will be more relaxed and the words will come easier.|`|d9foZHRoaa	just start rubbing on his d!ck and you won't need him to tell you anything.|`|e86b89a7ddaf966bb49bf950c5769b72aa	Maybe start off by building up his ego. Tell him some of the things you really like about him. And then ask him some questions about himself. You'll at least get him going alittle. Usually if a guy talks about himself abit he tends to relax alittle.  And look like your totally into him. Get him to look at you, keep eye contact. Good luck sweetie.|`|oiXSXqqcaa	Lay one on him.... a kiss that is|`|8RSDDKROaa	Give him an alcoholic beverage.|`|pHWLhQQZaa	Did you tell him in return that "YOU LIKE HIM TOO" rather than just joking around with him.    If you'll act too cool, it will confuse him, whether he is upto your level ? Don't crack jokes, instead be romantic with him.    A sensual kiss will release all his possible tension with you.

I am shy too , but I can find ways to talk to boys ...if u like him a lot show him your personality (after talking to him of course). And he will decide if he want to be your friend or something more ...   1) smile and look at him everytime you are near him   2) after some time find the strenght to talk to him . If you cant start with a ''hi'' and after talk to him for other reasons   3) who knows ?   GOOD LUCK !

It sounds like it's time to dump.|`|NMmrKmUcaa	just from experience,i think u should dump him.. if he truly loved u he wouldnt even like another girl let alone nearly kiss her.. id rather u just dump him and be sad, rather than him like breaking your heart.Break it off hun.goodluck.|`|GrXqz3pJaa	DUMP HIM without a question of a doubt!If he was really into you he wouldn't even be thinking about other women ESPECIALLY if it's within the first year of the relationship when it should be the honeymoon period.You'll be saving yourself alot of pain and heartache in the end!Move on to somebody better who's worth your attentions than staying with this loser!

The only thing you can do for now is respect your parents wishes, but if you are close enough to an age where you can move out, then do so. Because you have the right to be with whoever you want to. So when you do get your own place I suggest you tell your parents that though you love them, you don't wish to live in such a narrow minded home anymore. They will be welcome to come over, but if your bf is there then they can't by any means be rude in your home or anything like that to him.  But for now if you are still young tell the guy about your feelings and see what he thinks of being friends for now. If he can agree to that he is probably worth keeping. I'm sure he will be going through the same problem with his own family when they find out he is with you. But you both have to be strong and don't late the haterz get to you.|`|okKzpynoaa	.  Your only 15 yrs old and as long as you live in your parents house you should follow their rules.

I am a mom of 3 boys and while it would be different if my boys brought home a girlfriend from a different race I would get to know them before I ever pass judgement. Maybe you should introduce him to your parents have a few friends over and that way no one feels uncomfortable. If they get to know him and see that he is a good person they might feel differently. I wish you luck and I commend you for being true to yourself and loving people no matter what is on the outside. Your parents should be proud that they have raised a good person.|`|AA11136705	Congrats to you because you have been able to not let your parents prejudice blind you.  Color shouldn't matter but to people like your parents it does.  Don't ever close your mind to someone because of color.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Hello my friend,    I think its because dating sucks! It so hard to want to dive back into that awkward, stressful and generally unsatisfying mode of life... so we give people we are with, but probably shouldn't be a lot of extra room to change. I get the idea that some have hope that others can change and so might say that its because people generally aren't happy when alone. but for my 2 cents its because people don't want to commit the time and energy to starting from scratch all over again.

Despus me fijo en que tan bien nos llevamos, si me cae bien y si se ve que le caigo bien a ella, de que me sirve que me tenga bien prendido si se ve que no le paso. Claro que el cuerpo importa pero para mi no es lo esencial, eh salido con unas un poco pasadas de peso pero bien bonitas y simpticas.

You shouldn't rush things. Just take it slow and see what happens.|`|uXsYsjDsaa	ok im a seinor....look most guys this age can get a girl their own age and if hes askin u out then is it possible that hes trying to jus have sex??? but u shouldnt go out with him cuz ur parents would freak and plus what will u do when he graduates and goes to college?    i would think ur a good lookin girl u can get other guys that actually go to school wit u    WISH U THE BEST|`|DWHj3TVJaa	well unfortunetly you being a freshman and him being a senior he might be just going after you for so Fresh meat.. which i hate to say but all the guys i went to highschool when they asked out girls that much younger than them it was just so they could get some ***...because at that age your naive and you fall for the guys trick and think hes sincere...but on occassion there are the older guys like that that actually really do like you and wouldnt take advantage of you ...and as far as the parent thing goes just tell them how you met the guy, how long youve know him and ask your parents if he can come over for dinner to meet him...and parents even though they dont seem like it are good jugdes of characters...and if they dont think the guy should be trusted then you should listen to them they have had alot more experience with that sort of thing than you probably have..|`|oC5DLqHZaa	tell your parents about him and tell them about your feelings for this guy. also add that he likes you back and you want a clean relationship. it is really hard to do because parents can be REALLY judgmental  but its for the best. if you think about it , it would be even harder to go out with him behind your parents back, keeping it a secret , and imagine what they would do if they found out you didn't tell them. good luck!|`|C6A9eJ13aa	baby, i no u luv him.....but dnt simply fall into it...(.luv is no well 4 anybdy 2 jst fall lik tat).ask urself wot ur priorities r.....weter its parents or tis guy. at tis point , u may chose de guy over ur parents, but b4 takin a decision, try 2 knw a lil bit abt tis guy......weter hez a natural flirt...u knw wot i mean , rt?  judge 4 urself . if u think he deserves u.....well go ahead. still, b a lil cautios so as nt 2 hurt ur parents either....coz u dnt knw hw longg tis guy wld b der....but u can alwz count on ur parents. good luck!!!!!!!!!! god bless!!!!!!!!!!

cgQrQSvDaa	Talk with your friend about your concerns for her and she where she stands. Personaly if my friend started to hang out with someone that mean I would really wonder if she somewhere deep down inside is just as mean as that girl and I would never have a friend like that. If she does start to act like that just dont be around her much anymore if at all it sucks because I know you want to be with your friend but sometimes thats what has to be done and she will relize how mean and dumb she is being later on when karma hits her.|`|a8XJUYq4aa	all of yall should gang up on her skinny a s s and break her in half...lol
1TrRrWMLaa	If you have to coax it then his feelings may have changed. I am not saying they have and I am not trying to make you feel bad. When you say separate states, how far is that 100 miles 200 miles, 800 miles? The thing is long distance relationships do not usually turn out to good. I was in one for 5 months after dating a girl for a year. She had to move back to Japan. Yeah, now that's long distance! We ended it because she was not going to be able to come back to see me in the next year and I could not go there (her dad hated Americans, old bastard!!) Anyway, if you all are close enough and have the money and time to go see each other then do. If not, and it is a long distance, meaning it takes more than 5 hours by car. Then I would be his friend for now. I know it will hurt you, and him, but it will be the best for now. You all can get back together when the timing is right. I just think if you all keep this up you will break up with him or him you. I don't want to see you all not be friends at least. Keep that. In order to do that you should go your separate ways for now. Yes you should stay in touch, stay friends. I just think this long distance thing is putting a strain on the relationship and you all would be better off just e-mailing and chatting as friends for now.|`|6f137baf2f4a352d2d484402377ebeb2aa	Some guys need t olearn that.

I am in the same boat right now...i will keep you posted on my whole thing...keep me posted with yours...any advice for me? I have a question up to...if you want you can just email me...good luck bro|`|CnuwupbOaa	Most likely she has set her sight on someone else for awhile now and she'd like to keep herself open for a chance to get with him. Maintain your friendship with her and if she doesn't want to talk to you then that's how she wants to be, and you can't help that. Don't resentful of her, nor soft and emotional. You also don't want to wait with the hope that she'll give you that chance. Set you're sights on someone else who will actually give you their time. Eventually you'll lose feelings for this girl and feel fine about it.|`|494ac09fce514a73b57ec83c935ecd7baa	In your original question you did not say approx. how long (hours, days, weeks , etc.) since it has been since she quit talking to you. You also did not state yours and her approx. age)  After you told her your feelings ---- I get this feeling that you are closing in on her to fast and forcing yourself on her. I suggest you to back off considerable ---- do not force her to talk about your feelings and etc unless SHE brings up this subject and wants to talk about it. This will take time------remember ROME was not built in a day!  Bottom line ----no matter how you feel for her ---  for now leave her totaly alone for now--this will eventually bother her more later. Do not go out of your way to talk to her or confront her about anything unless she comes to you first !!!!!  This could go on two or three weeks  or a little longer. By this time ---she might have come to her senses that she may have hurt you or something she did is bothering you!!!!!!!!|`|DyijvjdOaa	That is so good that you were able to tell her how you feel! She is probably a little in shock because you were best mates. Give her a little space, but don't give up hope. She'll come around.|`|XoWY5PGgaa	it depends on if u ARE best friends or WERE... but the chance thing... just start out with going out as friends, chill for a sec and see what happens, cause it sounds like she's a little flustered and/or really uncomfortable with ur confession... so i suggest an apology "i'm sorry blah blah... don't wanna force you blah blah... can we get something to eat blah blah..." **blahs are for elaborations or anything else u wanna say** after that (if she DOES wanna go for that second date) all u gotta do is romance her... BUT be warned, if u guys do get together and then evenutally brake up or something... there's probably little hope for reviving your friendship 
8mEUTO9Waa	It is probably just his girlfriend and not Stephen. Maybe his girlfriend might envy or be jealous at you for being a close friend to the point where it could be a sibling relation closer to even their dating relation. And/or that maybe she's trying to get Stephen to herself so that nobody can get close to her boyfriend. Like as if maybe she's afraid to lose him? Your friend sounds like such a nice guy too ;).    But do you know Stephen's girlfriend? Does she know you? Does Stephen talk about you often lately?    Anyways...    Let's say/assume right now it was Stephen and not his girlfriend, and that Stephen is just telling her to say that to you on the phone. Maybe he is annoyed at you? For bothering him at a time like this? Have you done anything that might annoy him? Like care about him ALOT (A bit too much maybe)?    He should've called you to tell that he can't talk to you tonight and that his girlfriend is over his place. And now he put his girlfriend first then his friends last. Next time when you see him, or when Stephen or you try to call one another, you should tell him what happen about the thing on the phone earlier.    But because you're really good friends with him, I hope you get this sorted out quickly ;).|`|YJTa0hB5aa	girlfriend jealous of you!|`|Lc2y71JKaa	his girlfriend's jealous of u. typical..|`|4RmzT42maa	girlfriend jealous of you  being so close to him maybe?|`|tQZfiw7Qaa	Stephen probably didn't even realize she was answering his phone. Don't go by what that girl said. Ask Stephen.
si72zZ3Naa	Not as comfy as you guys, but yeah, you two are buds, sometimes you have to let things be secret, more romantic, as long as both are cool with the behavior then nothing wrong...|`|lfRL8zGhaa	Such incredible bizarre intimacies!  If you both are comfortable (as it seems you are) with this interplay, go for it.    As for me, I'm one who appreciates humor greatly.  However, that is a matter of perception, isn't it?!?  Bodily functions, to me, are not the more creative of expressive humor.  But again, to each his own.    I'm frankly not too sure what "comfy" and the list of antics you two shared have in common.  I see comfy as something warm, sensual and loving.  And although at this time I'm not in a relationship, I have no trouble envisioning what that feeling would be; and I think, if it's in the cards, it will happen-- but I'm not out looking for it.    But if you've been together for over a year and a half, you apparently are doing something right!!  Good luck...
JTa3zo8faa	I would preferr you to give her a little bit more time and eventually she would come around if she is worth the time. If this does not work than I would try to find someone else that is worth your time.|`|5M6uXDOMaa	you need to play it right to get her attention|`|bwn4A1tvaa	make her laugh. laughter is a plus plus!  complement her, but not too much. she would think you're lying. don't seem too obsessed with her. play it off cool. being clingy and showing too much love for her will definitely chase her away! good luck and i hope you get her!|`|g6pvccjNaa	Well i usually have the same problem but with guys.  If she plays hard to get.   chase after her more.  It means she wants you.  PLus ever think of doing something   Romantic to show her that you like her,  Most girls like to be told tat their being crushed on.|`|mG2pdxoQaa	well maybe instead of thinking "about" her...you could think of ways to get to talk to her.  You will never be satisfied with thoughts alone.  I mean she's probably trying to be nice because she doesn't really know you like she should before she decides that she would want you as her boyfriend.  You just have to talk to her more and let her figure you out and what you are about before she decides that you are the best for her.  Then if she likes who she's talking to then you will be pretty much happy.  Just keep her smiling and laughing and be someone that she would appreciate having as a boyfriend at all times.
BisUpJX3aa	Soft Swinging or Soft Swap: kissing, stroking, or having oral sex with a third or fourth person. Soft swap may be in the form of a threesome, group sex, or the literal swapping of partners.     Full Swap: having penetrative sex with someone other than one's partner. Although this is the commonly understood definition of swinging, it is not necessarily the most common type.

Putting your moral choises to a vote on Yahoo! is not going to help your crisis of conscience.

24805b1060958f8991d468325937af7aaa	He likes you. but ummm he sounds like a horny little boy. do NOT kiss him yet get to know him and go to the fair but keep it friendly. You should not allow this boy to grope you the first nite you get to know each other! (big mistake!) he might get the wrong idea and wanna get you in bed.    You havent done anything too bad so far. I suggest maybe going with a group of friends. It will be more like hanging out vs a date or something. Do NOT feel pressured to kiss him coz if he does like you NOT kissing him will make him like you more and he wont be able to brag to his friends how he got to first base with you!    So I would send him a text letting him know you wanna go to the fair and he should bring some friends coz your friends wanna go too.    As far as kissing goes. It is easy dont worry about it too much when it happens trust me you'll know what to do! ;-)    Good luck and take it slow.|`|dfZ8gZxlaa	Sure!  Everyone loves to get a call/text from anybody.  He'll be happy.|`|yltAO1gxaa	It's a hint that he wants to get some, but I don't know if he likes you.|`|20J2VCxRaa	GO FOR IT ! SURE! GO ON GIRL!|`|28ffd051d25c142a378b29d538b0f555aa	of course he likes you but if you guys don't date or anything yet then maybe you should wait to kiss him because he might kiss you one day then blow you off the next trust me iv been there and it hurts really bad and if you do decide to kiss him then just give him a little Peck then say he has to earn the big one not stuff like buying you things just being kind to you holding your hand and things like that|`|UyZ0n3Tgaa	NO.  I am going to give you the best advice ever:  The best kind of violence is silence...so do not call or text him.

M9y5U5RKaa	I think the most important point here in this problem is that he still has feelings for his ex-girlfriend.  It is in your best interest to not involve yourself with him until he gets over her.  Because if you do, things will get messy and there will be plenty of fights about this questionable ex-girlfriend.  So until he gets over her, simply do your own thing.  But once he somehow proves to you that he's over her, then you can re-analyze the situation and figure out whether the feelings are mutual.|`|2Dsmhb8oaa	He probable told the truth about his feeling for his ex but it doesn't mean that he wants to get back together with her if their relationship went on the rocks. I still have feeling for an ex but I have come to realize that when we met it was at the wrong time but the right person. Happens that ways sometimes. Now we become different people as time goes by. Ask him if this is the reason he said what he said. Be guided by what he says in response to your questions.|`|ObYky05Vaa	i think he really wants to go out with you but he is shy because since you are his friend he might think it would a little wierd. that happened to me to except it felt really wierd for me and her so right now we are just friends

S8mPJgVOaa	My advice is to get rid of your boy friend, you may feel like you need him but it sounds like he is just using you and guilting you into doing stuff with him. You are young and your hormones are going to affect your moods, like a lot! So depression, (to some extent) is normal.     Your dad is an adult and even though the situation is going to affect you, he will take care of it. You're just a kid still, (even though you may not feel like one,) and you need to remember that, and let your parents take care of you, even if it doesn't seem like they can handle it at the moment... don't worry, they can.    Your mom will get better, (you said sick, not dying right?) and yea, lol, you don't have to be emo to listen to sad music and feel depressed!     Your life will get better, the situation is just temporary, all you have to do is not be scared to let some things go, (like your boy friend,) and move on with everything else.     Seriously, the boy friend situation may be what most of your problems are stemming from. You don't exactly speak highly of him, and, (coming from someone who knows,) you need to keep in mind that he's not the ONLY guy for you. You need to find someone who is good for you, and I would suggest waiting until you are older to do so, (at least 18) by then you will know more of what, or who will be good for you.    The depression will fade, things will get better. Don't be afraid to talk to your parents, even though they are going through rough times too you guys are a family and need to keep the lines of communication open...    Hang in there girl!|`|gcRB3I3taa	yeah i understand you kinda sound borderline depressed i think i have that problem too. try listening to happy music try cascada that always cheers me up cause i get up and dance lol. and about your boyfriend if the only time you feel good is when you kiss him it doesnt sound like that great a relationship. i personally fell you should wait tell your 14 and then try dating again. but hey its your life. i hope htis helped.|`|7UCTh70caa	i can't explain your boyfriend, but sometimes we have those depressed days. i do. sometimes i feel like, i don't want to get out of bed, go back to sleep, i get bored really easily, and i eat sometimes becasue i'm bored.|`|74e86bd5dba46941fd38c9cadc5fdb9daa	hey, im 14 and both my parents are divorced, my dad lives somewhere, [i haven't seen him for a while] and my mom works 10 to 12 hours a day [ multiple jobs], i kinda know what your going through... i get through it by talking with my friends.. and there is one in particular to whom i can talk about anything with...    find someone you can connect to on an emotional level.. instead of physical. ive been there..|`|1JYQCKo1aa	you should worry about your mom becouse if        she's sick than you should help her get better  and don't worry about your dad I'm sure he'll         find another job and make lots of money  for you guys well good luck with everything Kim!

d666UDQJaa	Ele ta com medo de se apaixonar, porque voce tem a vitalidade que ele desejava ter.   Ele pode tambem estar pensando no que 'e melhor pra voce.Exemplo, qdo voce tiver 30 anos e quiser tem um bebe, ele vai estar com 73 e vai estar pronto pra ser avo ou passar dessa pra melhor.  Se voce so quer "passar um tempo" com ele, nao fale sobre relacionamento. Mostre seu lado forte. Mostre como voce domina seus lados mulher bricalhona e responsavel, mostre como voce 'e sexy.  Eu tenho 26 anos, meu ultimo namorado tinha 50. Eu agia com ele dessa forma, nunca falei nada mais profundo com ele, mas sempre estava la, ao lado dele pra tudo o que ele quisesse e na hora que ele quisesse. Eu comecei a achar que ele nao gostava realmente de mim, so estava comigo, pq eu era gostosa e ele podia "desfilar" com uma "garotinha" bem mais nova, o que pra ele era sinonimo de "poder". Um dia cansei, terminei com ele, disse tudo aquilo que eu pensava e que os outros comentavam de mim, por estar com ele (principalmente pq alem de "velho" ele era muito rico); ELE CHOROU, me suplicou pra nao ir, me contou dos planos secretos que estava fazendo para nos, disse que me amava. Mas era tarde demais. Eu nao quis mais ele.  Por tanto, se voce o ama. Nao se esponha tanto. Seja voce mesma, mas sem assustar.|`|boMayVc3aa	Olha, n?o tenho nada contra namorar com diferen?a de idade, mas aqui t um pouco exagerado.

Namun sobat harus ingat,   "Sehidup - semati"  Bukan : satu hidup, satu mati  Jadi, jikalau ada perasaan menyesal terbesit dalam hati sobat, segera buang itu jauh-jauh.    Untuk penyelesaiannya, beranikah sobat berterus terang jika sobat tidak tahan dg 'permainan' itu?  Dapatkah sobat menuruti kemauan istri setiap kali meminta? Jika tidak (atau lebih tepatnya sobat kurang bergairah), bisakah sobat menuruti permainannya dengan tanpa menghiraukan?

2w6OOIWwaa	Frankenstein's monster didn't scare me, and I first saw it when I was around six.    The Wicked Witch of the West didn't scare me, either -- I thought she was a campy hoot, which just goes to show how, um, different I was as a child -- but her flying monkeys scared the bejesus out of me.    I thought Freddie just needed a nice facial, and maybe some daily use of Oil of Olay.

In any case it isn't smart to "do it" until your married, that way you know both of you are in a serious relationship that both of you want to make last. What if you do do it and end up getting a kid and he leaves you? Even if you don't get a kid and he breaks up with you, you gotta take what you did with him with you for the rest of your life and with you if you do find someone else and get married. Sex is a very special gift that was meant for marriage and can have serious reprocusions if you don't wait till marriage. I am not saying that it doesn't work out alright for some people, but it is a huge risk. I would take a long time to think about it, weigh out the pros and cons of it, then make an educated (and not impulsive) decision.
hZEOJPkUaa	Verdict: He likes you. Since he's shy, you will probably be the one doing most of the work. Flirt with him and wait till you are both alone somewhere. I think that what he would like is that you go straight for the kiss. Good Luck!|`|wsLngQ8oaa	I think he likes you. A gutsy move on your part would be to tell him face to face. I did that with my bf and this is our second xmas together. remember the worst thing he can say is that he's not interested, and then at least you know. But if he likes you too, you may have found yorself a bf. Good luck|`|QyUBpVj3aa	it seems 2 me he really likes u maybe he didnt say he did cause he must have thought it was a joke or his friends would make fun of him its kinda emabrassin sayin yes and knowin they dont like u back maybe thats wut he thought u should tell him next time u r alone with him u really like him and if he says he just wants 2 be friends then thats fine also cause u would never wanna ruin a good friendship over a lousy relationship best of luck girl,|`|ueIK3Plraa	instead of telling him, how about just flirt with him and tease him. touch his arm or sit closer to him when you talk to him and invade his space. if he doesnt already like you, he will soon enough. make this dork make the first move.

HiU4VdXeaa	You will be surprise what happens to friends and family alike when there's a man involved.  Then it's you against them.  No one wants to acknowledge that they've made a mistake.  It's a strong person that can.  And having him say those things to your sister about you to make her feel even less of a person.  She can't hate him for fear of losing him, so she takes it out on you.  There is really no room for you if you want to come out with your sanity and not a victim.    If there is a way to live without them, I would suggest that you do as staying with this group will only bring you heartbreak and physical grief.  There are other people in the world.  Learn to make friends, but don't compare your life with theirs.  No one can determine what kind of hand is dealt them, but you can always take what you can and do the best you can and leave it behind, if that is possible.  They will only drag you down.|`|6b9f16e96c2d0ebf966aa8f8f2594404aa	I'm very sorry about the death of your Mom, but your 'family' was a mess before she died and they 'turned' on you. The best way to honor her memory is to be the kind of person she would be proud of.     You are absolutely right about not being able to change what other people think, say or do. So, guess what? That's leaves YOU. Are you willing to forgive and forget? You can still love your family and not get bummed out over how they choose to live their lives.    Everybody has problems. It's not our problems that get us down, it's how we handle them. God puts us in a 'bad' situation to see how we handle it. If we do good, he gives us a harder problem to solve. Some reward, huh? Overcoming adversity makes us a stronger and better person so we can in turn help others. God must really love you and is preparing you for something great.|`|AA11589367	Maybe if you weren't so judgmental you guys would get along better.

It's okay that you're shy because I'm shy also but just try suttle flirting, when you see him say hi and smile when he looks at you, talk to him, give him compliments and ask how he's doing, just simple ways to start a conversation. He should get the point and remember to be sweet and friendly and then see where it goes from there.    good luck!|`|P6iHpIksaa	Hmmm.  Just act like everything is normal.  Who cares if he knows you like him.  Lol.  Its not the end of the world.  =]]  You'll be fine.  I don't really think you should tell him upfront you like him.  But you should defintaly talk to him.  Just go up and ask him how his summer was.  Or whatever you want to say.  Hehe.  I've gone through this many times and eventually I got over being shy!  I was really shy once to.  =/  lol.  So just be yourself and if it turns out he may not like you because of what his friend might say.  Then hes retarded and you shouldn't like someone who lets someone else run his life anyways.  lol.  Wish you luck!|`|933559305e1af119722144d273f1b70faa	haha sounds like me...well get ur friend to tell him again so he knows u still like him, im totally super shy too!!! okkkkk
njrKjJVwaa	You should know that Jewish people are very loyal to their believes and keep traditions and habits alive. They are not against flirts with people of other religions, but in the end of the day, they marry a person from their own believe. The mentality differences are to big to overcome, even the Jewish man/woman would agree, their family would not. Family ties are very tight.
HSdOC56Naa	My soon to be husband is also from Chiapas, I've only met his brother and sister in law. Honestly, the SIL was not very accepting of me because I'm opinionated. As for your situation though, I have no idea how they will react to a black woman. I have lived in Mexico off and on for almost 5 years though, and from what I've seen it's just like here. Some of the people are racist and some are not. Just be yourself, and let your husband know if you are uncomfortable, maybe he can help you to better understand some of the customs and ways of doing things. And BTW, Chiapas is closer to Guatemala than Cancun. Cancun is a big tourist town, with lots of americanization. Chiapas is NOT. In some ways it is very much like a 3rd world country. If you want to know more about what it's like visiting that part of Mexico you can e-mail me with any questions you have.

OAlNhtDkaa	Figure out who YOU are and what YOU really enjoy doing.    That is the only way you will find someone that is right for you.  He will be mixing in the same cirlces.    Forget the nightclubs and traditional places for pulling blokes.  The chances are that the nice guy isn't hawking round a night club looking for a different girl every weekend.  He is probably off with his mates doing something that he enjoys rather than having a load of drunk mates.
n0RlaNwsaa	being a girl myself i can say we are a bit confusing but when someone tells me that i feel a little awkward about it. i dont think i look hideous but when someone says it i dont wanna sound arrogant and respond "yea i know" but i think she likes it when you say it and she's probably telling her girlfriends how much you tell her she's cute. dont worry about it or maybe she just doesnt believe it but honestly she likes the compliments, that's just how girls are.|`|Xc5bZezzaa	um...she's either fishing for compliments  or she has bad self-esteem  either one is bad.|`|nOgTVZKcaa	man i get u bro, i have the same problem with my gurl, i guess they wanna hear u say it, but sometimes they just have REAL low self-esteem...dont trip if u aint already goin out with this gurl just ask her out, maybe she'll believe u then....true dat though gurlz can be real confusing sometimez.|`|1wz2dH5Faa	because she likes hearing it and wants u to keep saying it|`|rs1pH54daa	well when people say I'm cute it makes me feel good but it sort of makes me shy and it emberasses me.  and then some people say it as a joke so some of us don't know what to think mabey that's how she feels.

Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog Porn Filter,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.    2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov    3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.    4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.    5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.    6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.      Stick with reputable sites.  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Delete it or close the window.

smLaBIb7aa	Just don't be too good or too bad with her .... and don't try to show her your  emotions when is not necessary because if you are telling her that you love her all the time and doing things such as bringing her flowers on a regular day (not her birthday) then she will get tired of you because girls don't like weak guys ...  but also don't make her suffer by cheating on her or being a jerk.|`|bSrfBdiuaa	I think the guy should try to impress the girl by doing nice and sweet things.  Ya, that's his job.  The girl's job is to look nice, and go out with the guy.    Just be respectful and sweet but don't be her servant.|`|7h0gS8jSaa	i think girls like the guys they feel comfortable with and ones that understand them but we usually like it when the guys are the more should i say aggressive, but i dont want u to get the wrong message. but ya kno wat i mean.|`|7MpYVq44aa	Every girl is different. But, girls like to be treated with respect. Most girls would love it if their boyfriend's did what you mentioned.|`|t5PIXFzIaa	Ronnie,    you guys are just 17 yrs. old ( i don't want to sound like your parents )    Tell why do you need a girlfriend now ?    I don't know what type of inviorment, you grew up in.  Just be a gentleman....    open the door for a women  let them know, how beautiful they are  give them a long stem rose    over all its a two way street... Don't do all the work  it should be 50-50    My advise is... you don't need a girlfriend. just have fun,  finish high school, go to college. and be somebody.    Good Luck
lcKjQo2maa	You are going to have to give this young girl a while to trust you and know that you are going to be around. So far she has a mom that left her, a step mom that left her, a father that has shown her that his love isn't forever, because he struck out twice already. Being nice does not develop relationships, trust does. Give it time and she will learn to trust you and she will learn that people can be trusted when it comes to love. Say what you mean and mean what you say! this is very important if you want her to learn to trust you in every aspect of your relationship. This does not mean it is okay for her to be disrespectful, so don't allow her to bad mouth you, it is okay for her to feel insecure but it is not okay for her to try and discredit you to others. You should Very Calmly let her know that you know what she tells others and if she has something to say about you then it is okay as long as it is the truth. This should limit her conversation material to others. Also let her know that if she needs to vent on the things that annoy her about you then she needs to tell you so you can work on a resolution. Good Luck, MJ|`|SqrPpm5Daa	How does your boyfriend feel about this?  You two should sit down and talk about this.  As long as he's seeing this the same way (that you're trying but she's at a difficult stage) then nothing she can do can hurt your relationship.  I'd agree that you keep acting the way you are and treat her with love and respect.      Outwitted  by Edwin Markham    He drew a circle that shut me out   Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.

What should you do?  Humble yourself a little and apologize A LOT  You insulted her house, her community, and her income level... Which by a lot of people standards is pretty darn great to be able to afford a 254,000 house!

1dbcab4a9e9431d3bcdcc1d8cf2e2e24aa	It really is not the roommate's place to have say in that department.  After all, he is your mom's friend and that is it.  It's not like he is your father, or even an uncle for that matter.  I would sit down with your mom- privately- and have a heart-to-heart talk about how you really feel.  Mention that you do not feel protected, but intruded upon by his behavior.  As far as career issues and limits on boys are concerned, that is your mom's job and not his.  She, after all, is the parent here- and has the authority to set limits with him as well as with you.  And don't be afraid to enlist the help of a school counselor.  Your mom may listen to him or her in such a way that it will be productive.|`|AA11626129	ignore him, some people like to protect( i do ) but he needs to learn when to protect and when not to, you will all ways have people looking out for you no matter how old you get or if you become a black belt in a karate

There is no way you can force someone to like you... she's just not feeling it! At least she gave you a couple of chances and was quite upfront about it. Glad she's a decent enough girl to at least try :)     The best thing to do is to just back off and respect her wishes. Still keep in touch with her at school and talk to her. Perhaps she'll change her mind down the road... but if you keep pressuring her and trying to go out with her, it will only push her away.     Good luck to you!

She is forced to do that by the society,by the men or the situation. You see Shilpa shetty only on screen. Do you know her personally? Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh, we see them on screen and not in their personal life. Learned people say, Rishi Moola, Stree Moola and Nadi Moola do not search.    All the X rated movies and MMS clippings, they are paid to do that, then edited and sold. we are fools to buy them and watch. Remember, Kamathuranam, NaBhayam, Na Lajja.

et2Gzvfcaa	He could be shy or he might feel weird if he just started talking to you. Next time you see him smile at him and say hi. If it's in class and you have a few minutes to talk say hi and ask what's up or something. If you see him at a locker ask what the homework was as an excuse to talk to him. Basically, just talk to him and smile and be nice.

AA10716193	It sounds like a nice beginning and the emotion makes you to take care of many details, counting texts, messages, etc. You are in the nice part of a construction. I think that is why you put so much attention to big and small details.  As I see it from a big distance, there is no problem, communication is operating and the whole things sounds right.  Do not worry about the confussion you had and his no answer until now. Just be sure to send a nice and clear message saying that you are ready for the next date hoping to see him on thursday.    In this order, the "ball" will be in his field and it will be his turn to write back.    I think it would be also great if you also "speak" and not only "write", because then you are using a LIMITED channel of contact when it is easy and perfect to use an UNLIMITED amount of channels.    Good luck next thursday :)  |`|EUP9OmNtaa	i think he thought you were ignoring him, so hes ignoring you.    just text him back when you can and say that you were just tied up at work and answered him as soon as you could.    hopefully he'll understand....    answer mine,  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|PYIA2FCFaa	so text him and tell him that you werent ignoring him, that you were busy at work. if he huffs about it then i suggest you stay away from cry babies...they are so annoying.|`|6O7Hyi2Xaa	he wants you    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    answer?

NuUdCz0Laa	I did not recognize cupids arrow at first, just though it was gas.  I was holding interviews in my motel suite, when I first met her, she was energetic, wonderful smile, great personality, to smart for the job I was offering.  We were both in bad marriages, but two years later, after our divorces, we dated for a short while, we both knew that it was meant to be, so we married.  We have been married over ten years now and I was blessed to have two of the greatest children ever.  Thanks for asking.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	In a bar, Had sex first night, Married about 90 days later.  My wife and I have been married for 37 happy years.  Of course I was 25 and she was 23.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	About 24 years ago my sister was dating her current husband.  I met his brother and was definitely interested.  I was in a relationship already, so I did nothing.  Several months later, I broke off my relationship (I figured if you are attracted to someone else, not a good sign). I called the brother and asked him out.      We celebrated our 21st anniversary last August.   We have 2 children (ages 15 and 12) and are very happy.  My sister and her husband had their 21st anniversary last June.  They have 4 children (ages 15, 13, 12, 9).|`|5EOLbVzQaa	I was a waitress at the local pizza hut. it was my second day working there and my husband came in with a friend of his. he was sooo handsome, and shy. i remember having to remind myself to breath when i brought him his drink...when he finally got the nerve up to ask me out on a date he seemed to be a bit nervous i accepted and he picked me up that night and we doubled with his friend. he bought me a single long stemmed red rose.  turned out his friend thought my husband was supposed to pay for him and his date too. but hubby had only brought enough to pay for me and him. so i ended up paying for his friend and his friends date. hubby was sure i would never want to see him again because of it. but i told him that i found nothing wrong with him he was so sweet and kind. when he was close it was like everything else didn't exist. 3 weeks later he proposed and 3 months later he was my husband. now 9 years and 4 kids later he still thrills my with just a touch.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	My husband and I met from an AOL chatroom.     August 4th 1998, I was in a chatroom I always was in. Out of the blue for the sh*ts and giggles of it. I typed "I want c*ck". I had about 5 guys IM me. Only 1 guy did I continue the conversation with. 2 days later he showed up at my door to have sex. Its now 11yrs later and we are happily married.     We both believe it was faith and we are soulmates. He proposed to me two years after we met. We lived together before getting married. And we went through 1 yr deployment when he was sent to Iraq.     I know in the end I could have gotten hurt for meeting him the way I did. But I don't regret it, I am glad I did. If we didn't decide to meet for sex, we would have never met. He did live 30mins north from me.  So at that time, I was still in highschool. He just came home from the Army, started college and then joined the National Guard. I couldn't have asked for a better guy to date through out highschool and take to my prom.|`|EENUWAP7aa	We met at Mcdonalds and she was the cashier taking my order. I finally asked her out and she agreed to it and the very first night out we made love. I thought to myself this was too easy, but what the heck I dove in head first and then got married six-months later.    Twenty-Four years later it's hard for me to put this entire puzzle together.    We definitely had rough times, but we are getting older now. She is 56 and I'm 49.    We've been together for so long that getting a divorce would not be logical.    We struggle at times to keep the flame going in our marriage. She is always ready for sex and I'm the opposite.    When she gets no sex from me she gets irritated and quick.    Keeping my wife happy is so easy right now, but yet so hard.    In my honest opinion, when you get married you have a cross road ahead and lots of bumpy hills to climb and the odds you get divorced are very high before reaching ten-years in marriage, but after reaching twenty-four years...it's so much easier to please a wife and keep a wife from what I've learned and all the Man has to do is definitely make love to her because she is not getting any younger either and she has needs to be met as well.    It's like a sexual comittment as well as  mutual loving respect for each other.    Marriage is a life long job until you get so old that sex finally doesn't cross your mind, but the respect is always there. That is what I've learned in my years of marriage. You may be too old to screw, but your not too old to kiss or hold each other with a nice hug and smile and that my friend is a marriage done good.|`|FAYS26keaa	when i say him walking to the park with my 3yrs old son, i wish then that this was my son father and that's what he became 12yrs later i still love this man. oh yeah and also the tube socks with stripes he had on with flip flop lousy dresser back the but i fell hard in love anyway, lol|`|7e44a9086eb4841be81c4b1540bf6218aa	I rented an apartment from him and he was always at my door bright and early holding a hot cup of java for me|`|d43572be4d732509a5fdc4d8b9b9291baa	We met when we were eight years old-married when we both were 45!|`|pTrDWCmxaa	Hi Vera,    I was introduced to my husband by my best friend.  We all met at a   bistro, my girlfriend and I and her boyfriend and my future spouse.  It wasn't love at first sight, that's only in the movie, but he did have some special qualities that attracted me.   We shared similar hoppies and we were both looking for a serious relationship with the right person, of course.  I was 23 and he was 24 year of age.  But there was a twist to our courtship.  One year, after dating my him, I didn't see us going anywhere,so I started making plans to join the "sisters of loretto" convent.  he then assumed I was seeing someone else, and that's when I told him about the convent.  On Valentines, five months later, he popped to question!    We have be married now for 22 years and I don't regret the decision I made.  Love does get stronger with the years and communication is a must.    Take care,  Alexis

z5N0fQITaa	umm you are describing Lust if anything women fall for men instantly then they constantly find faults with them and eventually break up|`|rlUUaSgqaa	It depends on the guy.  Some guys really don't give any thought to how well she knows them, or they prefer a girl who only knows their good side.  Other guys think it's really important to make sure you take your time and really get to know each other. |`|6D80q5gCaa	Unfortunately there are guys who tend to only want to get to know women based on their outter appearance such as shape, beauty, weight, make-up hair, skin tone and much more. However there are a small majority of men that look for inner beauty and want to get to know the woman on the inside such as her personality, her career goals, ambitions and dreams, her past, her past relationships, future goals, likes and dislikes etc. I wish more guys took the initiative to get to know women on the inside and what they are like.|`|YCXxP43Laa	It depends on what they are after and their personality. A guy who has hang ups from his past or is scared of commitment will avoid letting girls getting close to them, guys who are comfortable with themselves, and after something long lasting will want someone who knows them inside and out. Those who only want a girl to know their good side are actors, who have something to hide. |`|ou8dIjIKaa	Men, like women, are quirky in their own way. I'm gonna try to give you an honest answer about men and how they think. I can't speak for all men but I can speak for a lot of the men I know...    Yes, looks matters more to men than women. However, real men (i.e. worthwhile men) will try to strike up a balance when it comes to serious dating and marriage- a decent, healthy looking woman with a kick a** personality. Those hung up on looks TOO MUCh are usually the ones who will have problems finding a lasting relationship. Not to say I don't like attractive women (BECAUSE I DO!) but I generally look to see the best in every girl I meet. If I think there is potential for you and me then I'll definitely give it a shot- regardless of looks and personality, it's more about natural chemistry!    By the way, were you looking for a male opinion in particular or just anyone's opinion?|`|ZebCFZUHaa	Of course! However, in dating and initial interaction, alot is "left at home", so to speak. A woman sobbing uncontrollably or a man losing the rag aren't exactly the traits we look for, are they?     Both men and women need to portray themselves as emotionally stable, collected individuals, when in reality, we can be insecure, insensitive, ratty and boorish in reality!    I believe it comes down to respect in the end. Married friends of mine and those in strong relationships talk about how much respect they have for their partner, and how they can feel that reciprocated.     I also believe, these days, its the men that are the more romantic, and are more willing to inflate the positives of a woman's character instead of suppressing the negatives, as they might arise.|`|6tr7Pg0Xaa	we want a person that truly knows us, but just because you know us dose not mean we "like" you|`|VfI8ARtNaa	it depends on what type of men is he...   there are many types of men as well as the women. there are men who wants to have a serious relationship thats why it is important for them that the girl must know them very well and must accept them for who they are. and the other one is the opposite...:-) |`|AA10716193	Men can fall in love with a new girl without knowing her very well, and obviously without her knowing him. This does not mean it is all the time or our favorite system.  It only shows how important is many times to be with someone, how urgent it can be in certain situations, and how much we dream about a couple.  It also shows how much we think that the relation will be the field where we will meet each other and get to know who is with us.    It can be also that we want to get a couple BEFORE she gets to know us better. Perhaps we think we want a girl and after we get her we will have the time to know her better, and perhaps we think that girls want the same, first the man and after you will know him.    It is not a strategy, it is the way it happens.  It is not that we want to use a mask or only get to make a couple with a girl who does not know us. I think it is more that we are so interested in having a couple, that we take some risks, even by making a couple with a girl we do not know and does not know us.    Focus this more with the risk, chances, interest, and less with strategy, plan, preference.    Perhaps it is more that we have considered all our chances with the girls we already know, and that is why we need to look in new options.  
AA10716193	You builded around you an image, a standard, a status, and the rest of the world walked according to the music you played.    Now you want to play another music and you are surprised they are still walking as they used to.    First you have changed, now you need to announce it, to let them know about this. Then, the world will change and will walk or dance according to your new music.    Be patient and optimistic.    Go to places where you think you can get to know a man according to your wishes. What are you doing with drunk men? Where are you looking for your man? Try something better.    Make some innovations, clothes, places, attitudes, transform yourself in a theater fan and let men know about it, one of them will make his move and propose you to go together.... let them know you are open to share.  |`|i48kxrbaaa	Sometimes it seems that way. I didn't have my first bf till i was 20...and it was interesting.    I am still 20..turning 21. I am single again.  There's pros and cons in both. But if the single life is getting to you, then make an effort to meet new people, flirt, and go on dates.|`|MN0N0zTIaa	Stay optimistic, and be happy. Maybe when you were happy being single people didn't know what you were happy about, they just knew you were happy, and of course confident in yourself. Keep smiling it is so much easier for someone to approach you that way. Remember the present is a gift so celebrate whatever your current "status" is being single or in a relationship...you owe it to yourself to be happy.|`|JpyhnDRTaa	Honestly, Yhoor Time Will Come & Yhoo Can Show Off That Yhoo Have A Lovely Other Half- Be Proud Of Who Yhoo Are!!!|`|CtZ1VJ56aa	just go out there and try talking to one of the guys your interested in woman!:!:!: gotta be someone in ya class or something or one of ya friends that you have some kind of feelings for..it is hard but trust me if a guy out there likes you its even harder for him to try to talk to you especially  if you have the i love being single and don't need anyone else attitude =\       i don't know but hope i helped a little

5xm6pS2Saa	Get over him! He seems like a total freak to me. But maybe you come on a bit too strong.

But I mean, honestly, tried to throw you down a set of stairs...?|`|Lw1bbxSuaa	I'm like that to sometimes, but I just do stuff that'll distract me, like hang out with different guys who r hot, and listen to lots of music. If you avoid him too, that might be good. Overall, it'd probably just be best if you found something that doesn't remind you of him, and tried to do it as often as you can, so you won't b stalkerish, and only act like he's your friend, like if u see him at school, just say hi, you don't have to stop and start a whole conversation.|`|D4D9GuWQaa	well he doesnt sound like he is worthy of ur attentions...i dnt think there is anythin wrong with u but it sounds as if ur insecure .i know u feel like u want to go round there but u definitely shouldnt, u will only make him sick of u, it wont do any good. if u must contact him,definitely wait a little while and give him the chance to calm down and maybe just text him or somethin. honesty ur behaviour wont help u need to try and control urself and dont pester him.i know its hard but...and he should be physically hurting u he doesnt sound like a nice guy.|`|ZQzpsGGLaa	give him space girl.     help w/ mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|AA12069142	well.. this sounds almost excatly like my friend... she was obsessed with this guy too and we always joked she was staklerish too.  he was such a jerk to her.  the only way she has started to get over him was to find somebody else..  it was very hard for her but ti worked. now she realizes that he was such a jerk to her and now she is happy wiht somebody else.  i hope this helps..|`|1AdzD6bmaa	Listen to the warning signs:  he grabbed you by the collar and tried to throw you down the stairs!  And you want to go back to him?  My gawd woman, get some therapy.  Why do you want to be involved with someone who could cost you your life?  HE DOESN'T WANT YOU! Leave him to himself and move on.  If you cannot do that, seriously, seek professional therapy.  You need to learn how to change that self destructive behavior.  Don't be so desperate.  I'm not trying to be mean Diamond.....we've been answering each others questions for a while and I like you....but please, please, please listen to my advise.  I know love can be blind.....but it should never physically hurt. |`|kS33uSwFaa	maybe its because ur in love wit him u should leave him alone 4 a while nd then maybe he would start likeing u back....|`|0ee51f4812e4e9a4465d52b6b7a0ddfbaa	t is understandable to really like someone but you should try and stay away from guys that abuse you.

AA11099449	that is a hard one. I guess being supportive and trying to help her sort through this. In the end I guess it would be ultimately up to her on what she decides to do. good question.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Ok, I am not a man, but I would very much hope that my boyfriend would stand by my side and support me - if he did leave me then I would know that he never really loved me, or that he was a coward and my life would be better without him.|`|IkWcwsj8aa	i'd pay for an abortion,    ..your boyfriend sounds like a coward|`|T4N6a7MQaa	At this point he couldn't handle the emotional turmoil. Some men couldn't. Don't crucify him because of what he thinks and feels. Sorry it wasn't what you wanted to hear. Isn't it funny how game playing such as "what if" can come back and bite you in the @ss. Remember that it was a game.|`|x02jsjg6aa	I think he probably meant he'd leave you if you decided to keep and raise your rapist's baby.    If you took Plan B to do your best to avoid pregnancy, had an abortion, or found people to adopt it, I'm sure he wouldn't leave you.|`|2AoNw9Omaa	i am not a man at all but my answer to this is that your bf was kind of not trustworthy to you if he said that. SORRY!|`|nYgUfUd7aa	Wow, your boyfriend is quite the jerk and really isn't in love if he would abandon you so easily under that scenario...|`|W2pU2g9Eaa	Okay well I am not a guy but I asked my boyfriend and he said he would stay with me and raise the child as his own. No offense, but you should really consider your relationship because if he would leave you for something you had no control over is f***ed up!!|`|AA10857451	So you should be a more than a little hurt. If i was going with a girl I loved and this was to happen then I would be with her every minute of the day to help her through what would be the worst experience of her life. Are you sure your boy fiend really loves you??|`|7f0c57a2fb085459b00d18056fa02f8caa	i will keep loving her|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Firstly - girl, run for the hills, this isn't the guy for you.  If he couldn't even hypothetically stay with you in a time that you would most need his love, understanding and compassion then I don't think he's a particularly nice guy.  I can see why you'd be hurt by this.    If a man loves you, cares about you then he would never leave you just because you were raped and got pregnant.  Rape is never the fault of the person attacked, and what he is saying is that "if" you got raped, he doesn't care enough to be there for you.      Run, run, run away...|`|7541af920534320050bed438788e7151aa	Please dont leave her at this time she really need to prove whether you are a true friend.    Take her to counselling and she will be alright|`|xGXjSQAwaa	Have it aborted, unless she's against abortion... Then I'd be there for her... Unless our relationship wasn't serious in the first place, then I'd leave her. But your relationship is serious so it's kinda odd that he would say something like that.|`|DHz8g8nDaa	If that is the answer your BF gave, then maybe you should consider leaving him first.    If my GF was to be raped, first of all, I would presume that it was not her fault. However, she may have said she got raped just to cover up an affair so I would be a bit suspicious and investigate matters.    If the rape was legitimate, I would insist on an abortion immediately. This is for purely psychological reasons for both her and myself. Anyone who says that they will love the child of a brutal attack is not feeling anyone, including themselves.|`|RdUggxwNaa	Wow crazy question. Honestly I wouldn't know what to do. I know I would expect her to get an abortion but as far as me and her I'm not totally sure that I could ever look at her the same. That might make me sound like a dick but I'm just being honest. Not saying I wouldn't love her but it would definitely change the relationship. But from your boyfriends standpoint every time he went to touch you from then on the thought of you getting raped and him not being able to do anything about it and not being there to help you would probably screw with his mind.|`|J4BxsLSXaa	Ohhh, many people do abortation but its bad verry bad imagine ur babys live how happy he/she would be and everything and now imagine u aborting him/her a poor little baby! You know if ur bf DOES love u he will understand u, please explain to him that u dont want to kill ur own child and u two can raise him/her. Well if ur oposite my advice u can decide urself. Hope u do the right thing :) Good luck!!!! :) :)|`|C4ibOR7Laa	my boyfriend would never leave me if anything like that happened, if he got raped by another man would you leave him? no of course you wouldn't because you love him, maybe you should be asking if he really loves you|`|dE0vtX2eaa	jeez thats a hard question. i would aknowledge that it wasnt my girlfriends fault. have to put the child up for adoption. sure, i dont want it to die, as it is just an innocent human life. but in all honesty, i just couldnt live with it. i mean, just to see it everyday. knowing that it continues the bloodline of some bastard that raped the one i love. ya, an then id have my own kids. :P
DP5ZJzlxaa	I wouldn't think less of him, actually probably more i think its sweet.  We need more men like this, instead of men that go around with anyone and everyone!  Shows that you have respect for women i guess.  Only thing is, do you want your wife to be in pain on her wedding night?  Because my first time hurt and wasn't enjoyable at all! just a thought.  Maybe just have sex with only people who you love?   Thats my idea anyways. But no, i would probably think more of you :) xx|`|hXoTUil1aa	No, I respect that totally   I've got a HELL OF A LOT more respect for that type of man rather than one who had sex when he was 13 |`|TK1jVIkzaa	If I was sure he wasn't just in the closet then I'd respect him more for it.|`|h2WkfMzgaa	It wouldnt be weird; its rare. 1 in a mil.

Who am I to tell him otherwise? It's his choice. |`|HGNvisjfaa	that dont happen|`|f75x8aI3aa	No way. |`|lKI5ubM6aa	no of course not, thats really sweet|`|dPZ7iRuUaa	no we need more guys like that in this world|`|BbUXyAi1aa	I'd think more of them actually, because I want to wait too.|`|dTE8ADZ9aa	If he was wearing a purity ring then no.  (:  ox|`|3wmiypiNaa	I think that's very brave and really amazing I would never think less of any guy for that. |`|XjNjATbhaa	no, it shows that they're not just with you for sex and i'd respect that :)

Loud burping and discussing your bodily fluids is out of the question.    Just use common sense and table manners and you'll be fine.|`|BNEEH4Ataa	Just be polite.  Hold the door open for the ladies.  Say please, thank you, and yes ma'am.    |`|SHgtnhiuaa	Just be yourself! That place is great so I don't think you will even have time to worry cause it's very entertaining! Make sure that you do talk though cause guys seem to close up once they are around their gf's parents!|`|pcQi36h7aa	Be  polite, and respectful.Act like yourself.  What parents like is when you say "hi mrs. so-so, how are you?" They'll say something like "oh just call me sally, I'm fine" but it shows respect. "yes ma'am" is good too. I'd say a nice shirt without any funky writing is nice, and a nice pair of jeans would work. Just don't dress like a thug LoL, parents do not like that.    Just have fun, and enjoy your day ^_^|`|o7lAXurcaa	wrong section!!!

If your saying you have an addiction to sex counseling is always an option given your situation. Meanwhile if your holding out for the right reasons when it does eventually happen again, the long await will be worth it.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	I never recognize sex as an addiction.  I get that one can be addicted to most anything, but sex?  Isn't sex addiction the same as breathing addiction?  Since when has anyone tried sex and not want to do that again?  Who between the ages of 13 and 60 never get the urge for sex?  Glad to say I don't get it.    That being said, the answer to your question is that people who aren't getting any masturbate a lot.|`|5HoABdN4aa	I turn green like the incredible hulk    SteveC|`|6QkHAeXYaa	umm nothing.. keep on keepin on.. i think sex is a lil different than an addiction to a drug. |`|7W5bqU5oaa	its not a needed thing, look at monks and priest, they have to be celebate, not even masturbation...|`|gWE1MJOnaa	You stop caring after awhile. |`|AjgZhYR8aa	Nothing.  I didn't have sex until I got married at age 21 and I never had masturbated or tried to, either. It just never crossed my mind.    And no... I am not a "low drive" person at all, either.     It's definitely a very important aspect of life and marriage, and more of a need for men than women, but plenty of people don't have sex [due to beliefs or whatever] and are perfectly fine.    Now, if you're married and your spouse *refuses* to have sex with you, *that* will cause problems.

Build up to it. Ask her if she has anything planed for the weekend/holidays and that it would be good to catchup at an arcade, cinema, party etc etc and suggest swapping numbers.  Not sure how old the two of you are but i dare say your young and there is nothing worse then kicking yourself and thinking, "what if"   :)

Find the right guy and you will be fine.|`|o83jqZwOaa	personally, the fact that you're a chemical engineer would put you up there as a potential...however the truth is that most guys are intimidated by a chic thats smarter than them...and you're probably smarter than most guys...i honestly couldn't date a chic that was smarter than me...i want her to feel confident in my decision making...it almost makes you less manly if your girlfriend is the brainy one...that said, you'll probably get on better with a smarter guy anyway...|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	    If a guy seems to shy away from an educated woman, he feels threatened.Some guys just can't handle it.Don't let it mess with you rmind.I dated a "Warthog" pilot.She was amazing,and that's not a label...she was.She said I was one of the few men that she could feel comfortable around.We didn't stay together but we still E-mail about twice a year.She got stationed over seas and we lost touch but she's found a guy that can hang with her OK.      You need to understand that you have a special thing about you and you'll need to look a little longer for a man as special as yourself.      Guys that are are intimidated by accomplised women (people) need a doormat to wipe on and bolster their ego's.Hey , how about another engineer??? |`|j7ivUzCqaa	Im not sure what you mean by the question. What does a female chemical engineer have to do with anything? I see alot of female truck drivers. I strongly believe God made man and woman equal. Its supposed to be about building relationships. What ever happened to love and compassion. Do you believe in love and compassion? Please say or give me some kind of sign to let me know I am not the only one that believes that. I dont want to be all alone.|`|cJlQeyVLaa	Chemical engineer... That's sexy!|`|ulcyjyeEaa	I think that's really awesome... I mean if your in a field where most men are wouldn't that make you an interesting person to be with? And besides its not worth being with a guy who can't accept who you are or what you do for a living or your profession. Maybe the reason they stay away is that they are afraid that you'll surpass them. there are some guys out there who have a very high amount of pride within them so maybe that is just the case. I hope you'll find some guy who is worthy of your talents
AA10716193	he is having a great time, his ego is higher that any building you know, and every time he kisses he is having fun watching you staring at that.    Do not think that the eye contact is something better than being honest.  Do not think that kissing one watching another is better than a true heart.    So, yo need to decide what you want IN LIFE. not from him, but IN LIFE.    If he fits in your personal wishes for this life, then accept him as he is, or try to talk with him or make adjustments.   Anyway, as you are just friends, and not boy/girlfriend, it seems quite useless.    I would say that you should focus on what You want in life:   confusion?   labyrinths?   complex enigmas?    or do you want clear and Clean relations for you and your mates?  clear love signals?  clear friendships?  open conversations about situations?    You choose.....  Once you have chosen (that is a decision) ACT according to it.    do not break your head about what does he want, what does that mean.  Do let them put the enigmas and you will solve them, on the contrary, yo decide what do you want in life for you, and be selective, this works out, this does not, and then it is much easier.    Good luck      |`|SCL1Q1eLaa	first hes not worth if hes doing that just let your friend have the creep and second if hes doing that to make you jealous or mock you publicly you deserve someone better|`|prMLDM05aa	why do you like him if he does that to you?
Ectn7tkSaa	Personally I think it took her that long to answer you back because she was trying to get out of her previous plans but unfortunately couldn't.  You are right - if a girl really likes a guy she will do anything to keep their date so she can see him.  But as you said, she normally texts back much sooner so obviously something was wrong.  I don't think she has plans with friends.  I think she may have plans that she can't get out of and is too embarrassed to tell you.  Maybe it is a family function and she isn't ready for you to meet her whole family just yet or she is embarrassed to have you meet them, or worried you will think she is taking the relationship too seriously and doesn't want to scare you off.  If she does have plans with friends she may have been trying to get out of it and her friends made her feel bad for choosing you over them.  Friends can do that sometimes...trust me!  So many reasons why maybe she cancelled.  Another one could be that it is that time of the month and she gets bad stomach cramps and wouldn't be able to do anything that physical.  Maybe she didn't realise she was due.  If so, she would be too embarrassed to tell you.  So many reasons why it could be.  Don't take it personally.  Just wait for further dates to start getting worried.  If after this weekend everything goes back to how it used to be then there is nothing to worry about.|`|DCjyVQGJaa	Everyone feels guilty when they cancel a date, and as she gave you a reason, and it's the first time don't worry about it, people do forget. But if ti starts to become a regulary thing then start worring.|`|UsinktT9aa	Maybe she just found it difficult to say no to you and that is why it took her so long? Next time you see her, just ask her. She is the only one who can tell you and all this guessing and worrying will get you nowhere. Good luck!|`|wpzIAbtzaa	yes , if she lives in a conservative family|`|WhtjVvzUaa	If you have been on a lot of dates & everything is going well with her...    She would have called you to tell you if she had something more important than you. That did not happen.    If she rates you high in her life she would have replied to your txt as soon as she got it. At least in the same day. That did not happen.    Im not ruling you out. but you have to watch her more carefully of what she is up to or your place in her life. May be she has 2nd thoughts on you.     In your last date did you do anything of disliking to her? Did she enjoy? If the answers to this is NO then... may be there is nothing to worry...     |`|lnqAPAmqaa	Hi! reading this i felt as though she did remember she had plans with you but her friends have asked her out and she (may be cos she hasn't seen them fro awhile) has thought what the hell yeah i will go thinking well we will go cycling anytime,  Also it could even be one of her friends birthdays or something    I would feel guilty postponing a date yes if had strong feels for the person but if i didn't really want to do it in first place and was looking for way out then definitely not|`|FSsIhbVIaa	girls are also allowed to have friends, but if she cancels on you nxt week then get worried|`|anYGFC4waa	i dunno she seems stupid i would never let anyone wait so long if i were in her shoes
rlUUaSgqaa	Don't give up hope.  I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 23, but then it worked out really well and now we are happily married 8 years later.    Have you considered on-line dating sites?  That is a good way to meet men.  Also, if you just look and smile at guys, they will often respond to that.  Though if you can approach them yourself that is even better.  I really recommend a book called "The Real Rules" by Barbara DeAngelis.  It's about how to have confidence in meeting men.  Just don't confuse it with a different book called "The Rules" by different authors which is really not good.|`|7fHsyHYraa	Tell your friends, siblings and coworkers to please help you by doing a little matchmaking.  Ask them to introduce you to some nice guys.  Since you are shy I suggest you go with the people who introduced you and attend a football game, go fishing together, go dancing, go hiking, do something that is fun for both of you and get started dating.  Many nice young men are shy too.  Good luck. |`|jqXL4JDCaa	Well it's one thing to be attractive, but you've got to have an attractive personality too. I guess it would be the whole 'not social' thing..|`|ggEtDPg6aa	My guess is... it's because you, yourself admit your not social. You've got to take some risks in order to get the rewards.    Join a club, go out for a pint with friends, join a sports team or participate in a charity. You need to get out there if you plan on meeting someone.    If that doesn't work for you - consider online dating sites like match.com or lavalife.com just to get your feet wet. It works for loads of people. Whether it works for you or not, only time will tell.    Now... get outside and meet people!|`|W155OmfMaa	I hate to presume without validation or proof, but are you on the larger side? I don't mean a little, even as big as size 12, 14, 16 etc- I mean are you 20+, etc?  If so this may be your problem. Yes, personality is important but no one can read your personality from a picture or from across a room. If you are exceptionally larger, or unattractive try looking for a larger or unattractive guy. Its time to be honest with yourself- don't feel bad about it, just adjust. Its the law of nature, and you can't change who you are.|`|3WQOa4sraa	I agree with the first poster, You have to show the best from your personality    you should arange to have a social night out with friends approx once a week or month, try going to quite bars for live music between young people, this is the atmosphere where people get talking to others     another option is and I know it sounds weird but if you go to a church or maybe you could join a church and join the youth group, this will allow you to mingle in with a crowd and if you meet a guy, it will probably be a good one :)    also you must get to know yourself and build up confidence about who you are|`|AA10716193	The first action is to consider that you have a kind of anxiety about this, and that part may be perhaps being detected by the rest, so, try to hide that part, or much better, dissolve it.    Second action is to give value to the fact that you are free, that you are young, healthy and that you want positive things in this life. So, do not think everything is lost, on the contrary, many girls with couple are living a kind of hell just by being with "someone".    Third action, try to let men see you in places where you think you would find a kind of man you would like to know. If you like intellectuals go to a library, if you like sport guys go to a match, etc. Staying at home it will never happen, but going to the wrong place you will not meet the correct guy. Go where your kind of man might be.    Fourth action, you should not be in FIRST PLACE a single woman who wants to get married. No. In the first place you should be a nice lady, a persona nice to talk with, nice to share with, open to life, with projects, with ideas, with sensibility, not full of men around her, etc, what I mean, FIRST of all, you should be an atractive flower, of nice aroma and positive ideas... then all bees will be atracvted to this flower... nad then you may choose whci bee will be your king....    You must make your moves with strategy, and these would be in my opinion the first ones...       |`|paS5jKYFaa	I didn't date until I was 19 and in the Air Force. A nice smile goes a long way. So a nice smile while looking him in the eye might start it up. You could start talking to him. Are you one of those girls that's really good looking? Sometimes guys are afraid to approach a girl like that thinking they have to have a BF, and not wanting to get shot down. Yes, guys hate rejection also. You might just have to take a few chances. |`|qGwnx9qSaa	i have an idea. this is what you do..u wear a nice hot black dress and go to bar with a friend. so if u go by urself it might seem your desprate. so when u see hot guys looking at u. that means they are interested in your. just be calm. the next step for guys is buying you and your friend a drink. thenyou ask who its from and you go to the guys and say thank you and u make converstion from there. |`|WVEuPetBaa	Dating can be over rated... you will know in your heart if it's right.  If you have someone in mind that you are interested in you should by all means let him know. Once you start talking and break that "ice" if it's meant to be it will happen. who knows if he's not the "right one" by going out with him can just be the encouragement you need to put your best foot forward towards dating others. never give up love is worth the wait be honest and don't play games with others feelings and you'll do fine|`|4b54941034113c283c83940ea05c22a1aa	You are going to have to get outside of your comfort zone which I assume is the library or inside your room studying.  I like you have to socialize more when I return to college next year.  Prior to receiving my brain injury on Valentines day 2007 which forced me to be hospitalized and removed from school.  Prior to the injury I had been enrolled at CSUB and Sacramento state and at both places I didn't like anyone so I just stayed in my room studying all day.  Now I realize that I have to go after what I want because it isn't going to go around looking for me.  Studying is exceptionally important, but neither I nor you need to study all day.  The both of us should go out and socialize with other people so that we can choose the person we are going to marry, because the person is definitely not going to come looking for either of us when we are locked away in our rooms or the library.  I am a guy so I was already born with balls, I think you should pick yourself up a pair.  Getting out and socializing and having friends is not something that you or I need to do in order to stay alive, but it will enhance your life and my life.  And I mean really is a life with no friends even a real life, or a life worth living?  I don't know what your answer to that will be, but I know what my answer is and here is my answer.  In my mind a life with no friends is definitely not a life worth living, and I don't even consider it a real life.  Now I know what I'm gonna do and when I go back to college I am going to socialize and have friends so that I can feel alive and really be living.  The balls in your court.  What are you gonna do?

Be careful to not get into the trap of 9-5 disease where all you do is work and then you get home and ur parnter and you have nothing to talk about and other things interest you besides your partner. One tip my gf did was she joined in with me for video games and it was really cool, and after that, I realised that she missed doing things with me and I st thru the worst movie of all time... momma mia. its just trying to find a lil spark again, he needs to see that enjoyment of life is short and when the baby comes, he cant be playing games cos you'll need him. Everything will be ok, just keep at it to show him you still care for him and want to spend time with him.|`|aWjc5hN5aa	my girlfriend thinks all i wanna do is have sex too but thats not true he only wants to do it cause he loves you alot and chances are he only wants to do it with you and he prolly cant imageine doing it with anyone else and i love video games too and my girlfriend cant stand it but if she plays with me i love that and she has started to like it too ask him if you can play too and you might find that that is something you guys can do together and you might wanna sit him down and tell him that he has a child coming that needs a good influence yea kids like video games so he can teach the child but tell him that the kid is gonna need his daddy for alot more than video games and as for leaving him dont you guys will be much better together all i liked to do was stay home too but my girlfiend and me worked things out in the end and we couldn't be happier so just beleive in it cause in the end it will all pay off good luck.|`|OnFRIVeTaa	 You need to break up with this guy.

Life is too short! |`|wOBsmocTaa	Its the video games...He sounds like most my friends, all they do is play video games, "just chillin". They really are addictive, I used to be and I know a lot of people that are. Makes everything else less fun so why would he wanna go to an apple orchard? I'd say pour some water on the damn thing. As for the sex, tell him everytime he asks you're gonna make him wait another day, it shouldnt be something you ask for, it should just happen, or else he's just trying to get off and go back to his games...

I have always dated older men. I am 25 now and i wont even consider dating a man unless he is at LEAST 36. When i was 18 i dated men who were in their 30's. I have just never been one to tolerate younger men. They are not good with women and don't know the first thing about intimacy, romance or what love really means. They suck in the bedroom because they don't really care about pleasing a woman. An older man loves pleasing  a woman. Its what turns them on where younger men only think about themselves. Your only problem is it is illegal for a man who is 22 to date you. I also think that the mentality of a 16 year old is much different than the mentality of a 18-21 year old. So really it depends on the two people involved, but legally  it is wrong. But i also know that 17 is the age of consent. In my state it is anyways.|`|B52MQqgvaa	if your 16|`|hUZIYYzCaa	I wouldnt date the person if she was 16 and I was 22 ..

My only advice is to follow the heart. The heart knows what it wants. Trust me on this. I dont care (to a certain point) what the age difference is, if love is there, so shall it be. (AGAIN to a certain point) 6 is pushing it though 5 years apart maybe but 6, iz kinda pushing it. Alot of people would frown upon this but hell, like I said FOLLOW your heart, only you know how you feel about that other person. (This is the advice I would give)|`|BO8TrkTKaa	Let us make this simple.  If a minor Dates an Adult (18+) it is considered ILLEGAL.  Dating that person might result in them being put in jail!

bh7XBPuUaa	it'll be just fine sweetheart. Me and my boyfriend went an entire month and a half without talkn. It's not like you guys don't WANT to talk to eachother. You just CANT. The love will still be there two weeks from now... ;)|`|pnkiQWAZaa	Yeah, Of course, but you would need to ring him every day, about 5 times a day. and email him, maybe?    If not, your ****** babes!  Electra xx|`|RfzGOA5laa	yeah sure if you both like each other|`|631e90bc0eb6aaecbfeeff71951fd33faa	If you two can't figure out a way to keep your love alive because you can't talk for two weeks then you don't need to be in a relationship.....you both sound very immature to be honest........
xrsUt1Fzaa	he likes you. he doesn't know if you like him, but he definitely likes you...|`|rJ71QT4baa	Probly|`|kFcMoLI3aa	he likes you,  i think you should go for him  if you like him  be brave  =D|`|Yy9g9Fq7aa	yeah he likes you 
UFfJDWONaa	aww, im sorry.    but dont worry, you obviously didnt think he was right for you, but   dont worry.........theres another man out there for you just waiting.    :))|`|AXyLuQyjaa	Get over him!!!!! You broke up with him for no reason you caused him more pain then he ever caused you i wouldn't date you if i was him to!|`|XduOo2GZaa	listen to this song check yes juliet by we the kings. itll make you fell beter theres nothing you ccan do........|`|UCZ5GbCKaa	text him look out your window then be outside dressed in hot lingerie and be like feeling a bit lonley?|`|r7KIatUvaa	just let go i kno its hard =/|`|QDAuGZ7daa	MAKE HIM JELOUS|`|LZ15yGLzaa	wait a min. why did you break up with him for no reason?  second if you did he might think you might have another guy in mind  |`|GsEIcKOaaa	well you did hurt his feelings.  specially if u have no reason as to why you broke up.  i know that missing someone can make u go desperatee.  but breaking up with him was not the way to go.  tell hime how u feel about the whole situation and stop apologizing bc the damage is done and feelings were still hurt.  tell him the thruth and tell him that u just missed  him so much.  tell him you stiill love him..  but if he doesnt want u anymore.  leave it as it is.  i mean, at least you guys are still friends..right? ;]|`|QCpq8D2baa	You broke up with him out of the blue, he's bound to be heartbroken.  The trust is gone.  You might have to accept the fact that he means what he says, I know that's tough.  Or you could give it time and back off a little and wait and see.  Wish I could say more that's positive.|`|c411323103413b677f4d3821df11a882aa	I'm sorry to say that there's probably nothing that you can do. Saying sorry is hardly ever enough. You broke his heart. Would an apology mend your heart? I don't think so.    If he's already spending all his time with other people, he's trying to move on. As painful as it may be, you should probably do the same. Go do something new. Try something you've never tried before. Painting, sculpting, Tai Chi, wrestling, decorating, collecting butterflies, get a manicure, go to a spa, something. Just do something new.|`|OTVM1CkHaa	Well I will give you my point of view as a guy. I do not know his age, but it seems as if he is heart broken. I put my self in his place and think what if my girlfriend did that to me? honestly I believe he is offended and heart broken at this point. He probably is saying to himself if it was that easy for you to break up with him why do you want him back? He may also feel used, disrespected. Many feelings might be coming to his mind and I think he is still hurt so he is unconsciously putting you off because deep down inside he may be a bit angry. Give him time and don't smother him. Remember you were the one who broke up with him in the first place. He is going to try and do things to forget but he will only go so far. Remember that things happen for a reason and time heels wounds. Good luck and power to you.|`|rM7Qh360aa	why would you break up with him for no reason? you are creating drama when there shouldn't be.|`|t46GJv2waa	not mcuh your can do. you really simply made the decision to leave him and that's all. if he wants to get back together than that'll happen. but he's finding new girls.  you can find new guys too can't you?  certainly not right now, give yourself time to heal and everything. thing WILL get better and it's surely not the end of the world.    best of luck!|`|7VwOaFQmaa	Why did u dump him?|`|f12bdc98dceb2bff3d1d84b5b448de7eaa	well first of all i think he is just heart broken...( because you just randomly broke up with him, when he least expected)  i think you should keep on talking or trying to talk to him and he will get around it..  i think he is just hurt very badly... you know how guys are, it takes them awhile to figure it out.. but im pretty sure he will forgive you.. especailly if he really truly loves you.. :)  good luck
t0A88duRaa	that would honestly get on my nerves so totally see your point!  Why don't you start leaving your bf comments and then just say something like "I think we should go to the cinema this w/e but maybe go for dinner before"??? and you could include subtle yet saucy remarks which will please your bf but give the other girl a subtle warning!     good luck|`|yYbQE1olaa	If you dont like all this then just tell him Good luick x|`|4ihOcHKtaa	Just tell him that he should stop messaging her because it bothers you.   Or you could do the same with another guy and make sure he finds out about it. Make him feel exactly what he puts you through. Let him taste from his own medicine.

OX2eaKC7aa	Hes distance from you  His story doesn't follow up  Hes out alot  If you have access to his personal stuff check it.  -e-mail  -facebook  -myspace  -bank account if he has a debt card and uses it frequently see how much hes charging on it this will allow you too see how much hes spending in one place, and you can usually tell if hes eating for 2 or 1. ;-)  Check his phone  His attitude well change. You can usually tell this in there eyes. which will tell you if there distance.  When hes out and you call he doesn't pick up right away. Or hes some where low key.  He doesn't feel like eating out as much or going out as much with you|`|vj2pWs9Maa	He might be acting different - either more affectionate or less affectionate.  Acting strange/vague/defensive when you ask him about things.  Unreliable.  Making or taking calls into another room when you're there.  Not going out in public as much.  Not willing to make plans with you.  Going out more without you.    There's many more, but this is the best I could come up with for now.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I once had a roommate with a cheating boyfriend here is what she found... check his pillow for hair that is not his or yours... check dirty laundry for extra wet towels... watch his gas millage... look for condom usage... check for extra glasses being used... if he changes his cell phone usage... he changes his cologne or how he does his hair... or like my ex husband he had his ex girlfriend move in with us and said he was not sleeping with her!  Good luck... I hope he is innocent, I like to believe in men.|`|9NY3J0w2aa	When he lies to you about who he's with.    Show my question some love?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|084ca43a3959eb163fc61f1fc4f795dcaa	if he stops paying attention to you, hides his phone, goes out a lot with out you and never even invites you and is just really secretive about funny things maybe who he is with or his emails. bascially when he tries really hard to hide things from you and dosnt seem as open as he was once was.|`|tEhUGoRcaa	if he is really jealous, chances are he feels guilty about something so he is thinking you may have done the same. If he doesn't answer your texts or calls for a while and when he finally does, he gives no explanation of why he didn't answer you. The final one i have is, if he is making you wonder if he is cheating, more then just a thought crossing your mind, he's cheating, these are all personal experiences|`|AA12048033	when he says...      i need some space  shes just my friend  his phone rings and he doesnt answer if youre there  his phone rings and he walks away from you to answer  he doesnt ever answer his phone when you call him  he doesnt look at you how he used to  he seems bored all the time  he wants to go out with "the guys" alot  hes working alot of "overtime"|`|sEG4y06Eaa	try this page.. it has a long list & examples :]    http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_s...|`|zIiBTpZFaa	This can be really hard to tell. But really if he is your boyfriend only YOU can notice things that are different that make you think he is unfaithful. I would say however acting weird toward you, not spending a lot of time to together. Or lieing about about stuff. "where were you last night?" and he can't give you a quick honest answer. Honestly honey ONLY you can know if he's cheating if you have to ask then I think something may be wrong.     I really hope this helps! Good luck   Jen|`|IUeBv54Vaa	- stop calling or call less  - stop saying i love u [if u ever even say that]  - makes excuses to stop hanging out  -[ if u r having sex] wont have sex  - see him texting alot when you are around  - rarely pays attention  - asks you "where do we stand?"  - has a lot of female friends  - never lets you see his phone  - stutters  -says unusual things    any other things|`|78A81fBJaa	Lower desire to be with you sexually.   Suddenly tries new sexual positions.   Working late more often.   Mysterious phone calls.   Gets angry when you look at the cell phone, pager, or computer. Is secretive of such.   Smell of perfume on their clothing.   Takes a shower as soon as he comes home.   You find hairs or other objects on his body or in his possessions.   Starts taking more care with his appearance.   Accuses you of cheating.   He changes his normal routine without cause or reason. |`|640bb0b0f0b1e7a0d86f1335e874ec62aa	I think that the number one way to tell is if he is super jealous. If he thinks you're cheating on him, it's probably because he's the one cheating.     If he is never around often. If his phone goes to voice mail often. If he suddenly is starting to work overtime, but you don't notice him bringing in more money.     If he isn't interested in being intimate with you.     If he suddenly is starting to work out more and is interested more in his looks. Like changing his wardrobe or hairstyle. This shows he is trying to impress someone new.     There is really no surefire way to tell. But if you suspect it, then he most likely is cheating on you.     I've been cheated on plenty of times.|`|UEiTYFA4aa	he doesnt act the same around you,  "never has time" 2 be with u,  acts fake(makes up excuses for being late,not arriving, ect)  nervousness  u can tell if theyre cheating on u by how much time they spend with u && how much they enjoy it, if theyre acting impatient during a date or make up excuses 4 not coming something then u know theyre cheating most likely|`|W9hYGRIMaa	he lies about who hes talking to. I caught mine b/c everytime a private   would call he would say it was his mother n go in the other rm. I finally saw his cell phone bill one day and found out everytime that private   called, was 5 minutes after he called his ex-girlfriend.  Other signs...  lies about everything (where he is, who hes with)  uses the public bathroom alot to make calls  doesnt always pick up his phone  dont have sex as often  hes less intimitate|`|uDoOngmmaa	if you are wondering ...something is not right. but some guys can cover it pretty good. but dont be paranoid about it.... truth comes out eventully|`|gP5d2Ileaa	If he starts lying to you or hiding things from you.  I think you really have to trust your gut instincts with this one unless you are normally the jealous type...in which case you might overreact.  |`|Q2KBTqvhaa	always preoccupied  very protective of cell phone, email, etc  always has to be somewhere else than with you  never answers phone  doesnt call you baby or babe as often  gets mysterious calls, claims its cousins or friends calling  |`|3E9GjRKnaa	If he stops paying attention to you. Try to check out his phone records, where he is every minute of the day... and if your NOT moved in together I would try that. Also I suggested if you have any evidence than you should talk to him. Ok? I hope this helps. :)|`|9Yjiqvp3aa	look on his phone & email..    aha answer mine ?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...
GBr9YngTaa	HAHA. Just listen to it, either way you might offend her. However, you could say something like "Baby, just live in this moment and we'll talk about it later"|`|8wXuf8gAaa	wow! hahaha! lol  Well I say just give her a REALLY big orgasm and stick it in there REALLY hard. That'll make her forget what she was talking about.|`|eqEae97raa	Wow! Never heard of that!? She probably feels guilty about premarital sex and figures if you both discuss it while having sex, she can then  justify it that way?  You better RUN! Sounds like she wants a commitment and the sex before marriage is getting to her! Unless you do plan on being with her for life, then I'd say she's really into you!  How can someone talk about such things with someone at their most intimate moment unless they are thinking way beyond the moment?  Good Luck!    Please answer mine:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|NEXWW6luaa	talk to her while not having sex  let her know your getting the message but  you need to think about it  and her always bringing it up   isn't helping... or something like that  lol good luck!|`|tXe51jqPaa	Must be catholic cuz that seems kind of counter productive to talk about that during sex...|`|XxE0Pszhaa	My gosh, sounds like a lunatic.    Whisper in her ear, tell her how she has a sweet puussy and say u love her (even if u don't). Make her cry out, just ***** her hard; make her moan instead of talking. Rub her cliits and make her cuum :-)    |`|ded67a0b2e7e52c2691947fb4e226735aa	Do you think that she is having sex with you just so she can talk to you about reforming? You can tell her that she has your full attention but talking about going to church during sex is not something that you would fully grasp with your mind. Tell her to talk about it during lunch or dinner and make sure that you really give her your full attention.|`|FFNXkiFLaa	LOL OMGGG she seems so jokes you should stick with her.|`|AXyLuQyjaa	Go to church with her make her happy and in return she will make you happy...... ;)|`|QCpq8D2baa	That's kind of distracting!  Why not bring up the issue when you're not in bed and share your thoughts on the matter.  That might put an end to the church talk during the love making sessions! Good luck. :)|`|XjzkzGLAaa	Seriously, dude, go to church with her next sunday then take her home and do the dogsh*t out of her! That should shut her up 4 a while.|`|WQ1Ok73Faa	Kiss her during sex, it's easy.|`|c411323103413b677f4d3821df11a882aa	Well, isn't that interesting? Are you sure she wants to be having sex if all she's doing it sermonizing you during it? Sounds like she has something else on the mind than the moment...|`|f34f90B9aa	i guess she;s drawing you into the "trap"    so that means if you dont go, shes gonna say no more sex|`|UOeo77AUaa	hahahahahah im sorry but i find that reallllllly funny =]  but talk to her about it not during... before/after|`|nrgRfnhWaa	I thought premarital sex was against religion. You can go to church, but you've also got to follow the bible. o_o
wwRasDZLaa	Just let her live her own life.  There are a lot of jerks out there and she just needs some time to meet the right guy.  It could be that she comes off and cold and distant and guys are too scared to approach her.  But that's just speculation and I don't have a whole lot of details to work with.  Just be a good friend and things will eventually work out for her.  If you are a guy, are you asking why your friend doesn't want to be romantic with you?  I get the feeling that you're leaving some details out.  |`|xri2lFpKaa	she will eventually be attracted to someone...whether its a guy or girl    there will be some spark...just give it time|`|rSHDuSsLaa	Women and girls are wired differently from men. Despite what liberals will tell you, women are more touched by the heart, like where the prince kisses Sleeping Beauty, ect.     This is normal, and I assure you wholeheartedly, most young men today don't have a whole lot in the way of principle or values. Girls don't care about penis size, and there's no real turn on value to a slick hairdo, or even fake bulging muscles.    I'm mainly talking about sensible, down to earth girls and not slutty ones, tramps or airheads.    This can also help; and please show her this post and the articles in these links:    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|dtUtINmoaa	It is completely possible. I had a friend like that, but she eventually grew out of it. The problem is, she probably hasn't been subjected with the aspect of 'sex' for a very long time. She needs to learn a little about human sexuality to fully understand or grow into it. Does she get out much?|`|1N3wmqz7aa	ummm her sexuality is none of you're business.|`|cRTD17ekaa	I HAVE TO HAVE THIS GIRL !!! She is VERY SMART !!

Haha. well im pretty sure she has gone through puberty and its true that some people are not easily attracted to some people.    But i do think that maybe she is too shy to admit it or to say something|`|7302f131a1ff084c70173918d9df4c85aa	actually i'm like that a lot as well.  it's just she is very picky like me.  she wants a certain look and certain way she likes her guy to dress..and a certain height...list goes on.  also she might be fantasying about unrealistic expectations about guys when in life, photos of guys in magazines wear make-up too.  bottomline, it takes a whole lot of effort backstage to make those commercials out there.  for a while, my dream guy was one of those til I found out that was so unreal.  so no, your friend is not asexual.  but I'm not settling for second best in looks either so is your friend. she doesn't want to just date around 4 any guy.  she wants a guy that looks good as well as some personality.   |`|OgqSzXXfaa	its uncommon but i do know a guy just like this.  he is actually really good looking and smart, but just doesnt have any sexual attractions, and has decided to join the seminary,|`|8gwPifGvaa	lots of weird people in the world. Look on the bright side at least shes not eating babies and bathing in blood like some of these other sick freaks out there!|`|nCEdTLBKaa	I've only really liked one guy in my life and I'm 22. I think some people are just naturally picky when it comes to the opposite sex. You need someone really, really special to feel the attraction and those people just don't come around too often.

They will get everything they deserve,it's called Karma.|`|wRoNg8yjaa	Listen i know how that feels dont wori about it . itl die down and the lad probs does feel the same .. treat them mean and keep them keen ,, hes just playing hard to get , get his number or email address txt him , ring him, email him and chat to him just you 2 , or arange to meet sumwhere and talk then x|`|fuQz3OH4aa	Try to ignore them and find someone better,  You dont want to be with someone like that  :)|`|113575d6a12763d48aebc6a74e509c56aa	kick him in the nuts and laugh|`|RFcjPD0xaa	Try not to lose it and play it cool.|`|Ksbf5OUQaa	Well that just shows how childish they are, i mean what is funny about someone liking someone. Seriously if you show youre bothered by it they will keep doing it. I know its a bit upsetting for you but just ignore them.|`|1a2b9283355266ff13dce2f0e83fc6fcaa	Tell them to GROW UP|`|OYowAXAnaa	Well, we are all human. It's natural for us to be attracted to people.  Tell them losers to shut up, because you never know, one of them might end up being a dustbin man.|`|LstmPMDNaa	they have no lives and are all losers tell em that and laugh at them. and act like u don't give a ****|`|ir45TTqgaa	spread a rumor around that he wears pjs with " mommys little man "  written on them, the only way to end the focus on you is to shift it onto someone else, as for the laughing...... just take it, if you react to it then they know they can get to you.  good luck|`|ThsmCXIBaa	this happened to me once i know how bad it feels. i just tried to ignore them. your friends probably only say that cause they fancy him you could try find out who they fancy and give them a taste of there own medicine. also you need to get someone on your side so your not alone try and befriend someone in the same position as you. if your popular or good looking the boy will probably stop if your not just try to get used to them they might not go out with you but you could at least become there  friend its a good start    hope it helps|`|95vE5dx5aa	Pepper spray works real well.|`|GQyTF8vqaa	Oh boy darling, we've all been there. Honestly the only thing you can do, is either laugh with them, or agree that yeah you DID like him. Trust me, it will become a thing of the past very quick. Something new will happen, and everyone will forget. It might be hard while they remember, but don't be embarrassed.   Keep your head up high!|`|gPhBf6tJaa	best way to do that is to laugh as well.  turn the laughing around by saying something like "youre only laughing cos you think hes ugly and nobody would ever fancy him"|`|Tk3C6qlYaa	ignore them all especialy this lad you like. he sounds like a complete waste of space. the others in your class sound sad im sure they all fancy someone as well. just try not to show it is getting to you and carry on as normal|`|To8MiUAGaa	I agree with Ginny.  If you admit you liked him then what have they got to tease you about.  Or just ignore them.  Ignoring people works wonders because they see it doesn't bother you and give up.  Teasing is generally about getting a reaction...no reaction...no reason to tease.

POZvhqj4aa	he is too young to know how to like a girl|`|8pt0fYPOaa	Ever hear the phrase: Go with the flow...?    Go with the flow - spend your time being the best you - stop plotting, just be who you are - and let things take their natural course... if you are in classes together, you may end up on the same team on a debate or do a project together; don't always be the one who starts the conversation, and don't be so shy that if you catch him looking at you, that you don't smile back - Give him time to notice you - and I am sure he will -     Usually you get the guy when you aren't paying attention - when you aren't looking.  what I mean is - if you look too hard, you may miss the opportunity that is starring you right in the face! - you may even scare him off - just relax, be you. You will attract others who like you for you.... and maybe even him... |`|iWnxwVMMaa	hmm im not sure i think ur older than me so it may be harder...  help anyone?

kELV5TDnaa	You know what, my boyfriend and I are in the same situation...we are both combating different forms of depression, and he has ptsd from the military, but anywho...we often find ourselves in similar fights where we say the meanest things to each other...and at times i often recognize that i take some of the things he does for granted, but my depression and (probably) my pride make it hard for me to openly let him know that i recognize my own mistakes....    The biggest problem in our relationship, and maybe also in yours is that you are both showing each other you love each other in ways that arent necessarily addressing the "love needs" of one another. Maybe you need more hugs or compliments, which may not work for her, maybe her love need is more of a quiet, listening kind of love. we all have different needs, and when you love someone you do your best to love them in a way that fills both of your love need buckets up!    I suggest you give her some space, but at the same time let her know that you are sincerely sorry and you love her and you plan on being there for her through thick and thin! My bf and I have (regretfully) threatened to break up with each other mannnnnyyy times, but it has been 4 years and we are still together because we SINCERELY love each other and are each others best friends. In times of hurt and pain, we say things we dont always mean, and although things like that cannot easily be forgotten, they can be forgiven, you just need to be patient and give it time.     On a side note, if you really want to work on your relationship further, I highly recommend you read "5 love needs" by gary rosenburg....it really opened both of our eyes up, and even seek couples therapy if she is willing to go....love take a lot of work, and it can hurt like hell when you feel like your the only one giving 100%....but its all worth it in the end when you know you love each other unconditionally.|`|e0k3oyavaa	Give her time to cool off first and let her figure things out. If things get desprate go to her house or something, to show that you are really sorry. She def. needs you there though for support. It seems like you really do love her so do whatever it takes to get her back and no that you are sorry, make her feel loved and wanted. Even though she doesnt return the same feelings you give her atleast she is like..idk how to explain it...like good.|`|MspRoY8qaa	hun i honstly think she dosnt like you !! drunk people say those things for attention! if she dosnt respect you then 9 times out of 10 she dosnt love you! in my opinion id call her and tell her you wish the best for her and to get some theorapy!! you were just being honest and you let it build up !|`|X7Zk82Rsaa	Stop getting drunk this relationship does not sound healthy dealing with a dpressed person is a huge challenge|`|ty3J7aluaa	Go to her house with flowers and say you're sorry and that you were wrong.. It always works in the movies.|`|vnF9GipDaa	you both need therapy. Look into codependancy...|`|kzLJbZMBaa	Depression is never an excuse to treat someone badly. You haven't given much information in your question, like does she acknowledge that she sometimes takes you for granted? When you and she argue, does she accept that she bears some responsibility for the argument or does it always seem to be your fault somehow? Does she recognize that she is depressed, and has she done anything about getting help for her depression?    These and other questions are things to be considered but based on the information you've given here she is being emotionally abusive. Another consideration is, if she treats you this shabbily, why do you continue to stay and allow it? We teach those around us how to treat us. By allowing her to treat you this way and continuing to return to her time and again for more of the same abuse you are telling her that it's ok to take her anger and frustration and depression out on you because you are convenient for that purpose, but that she doesn't have to respect or appreciate the love and caring that you give her.    my humble oppinion is, if she's not willing to start treating you better then kick her to the curb... you sound like a good guy who deserves way way better.    good luck, hope this gave you some food for thought.|`|yBvUoCs6aa	apologize and like get her sum chocolate or flowers..or even better write an apology letter about how you truly feel for her =]|`|MLJRR5agaa	just don't be a azzz, or if her depression is too hard for you to deal with , find someone else. YOu both need peace|`|u3tJn5g1aa	sounds to me like this girl needs some help, i mean im depressed but i appreciate all my b/f does for me..I don't understand this at all, unless she is trying to push you out of her life..Give her some space and see if she comes around...|`|nqvKBPdUaa	well from what i read(sorry dude too damn long) if you  knew she was suicidal than why would you do things  to hurt her. you have to take her **** b/c shes depressed  and dont know what shes talking about. and dont get her  flowers on anything like that. bring her out on a date or   something|`|YItJjGNCaa	honestly you got the answer right under your nose    give her chocolate, flowers, her fav candy, her fav drink, her fav meal, a 100 page apology letter explaining EVERYTHING, rent her fav movie.    then tell her you cant take it anymore, you need a long break from her.    after that, go back and see how shes doing.|`|83oULw1Caa	Depression this big needs to be treated by a certified psychiatrist.  the best thing you can do for people like this is leave them alone or ask them to visit a doctor. Depressed people make life miserable for themselves and for people around them. (I had one in the family who committed suicide). If you keep on trying to "make" them better it won't work. It will work only if she wants to change. My advice is leave her alone for your own good. Sometimes you need to be selfish. And please DON'T DRINK.|`|eKxP94QJaa	I would love 2 have u as my boyfriend. what to go out? just playin'! but u do sound really sweat. way to sweet 4 her. when i am in a depression and my bf trys 2 cheer me up i apperciate it. ur gf on the other hand is a total biatch (on offense) i think u are forcing yourself to love her. any other guy would have dumped her on the spot. do u hear me. ON THE SPOT. she must have u hepnatiesed with her boobs or something. either that u ur just plain dump. u is way to good 4 her. move on to a girl that will appercate u, k. u sound way to sweet. luck, bye.
Sb9Nvvu1aa	If by that you mean which do I think I'd be happier as?  I'd be happier as the one loving more.  But loving without being loved in return is destructive.
RYtFGaJ6aa	Seems like you two know each other pretty well already.  If he says he only wants to be good friends then I don't think flirting will help much; he may even end up pushing you away.  He already knows you like him.    It IS possible that he could change his mind and decide to like you more now; but I think usually guys are not likely to change unless perhaps you have changed.    I would certainly continue to be friends but be careful with flirting.  One or both of you may end up getting hurt.|`|nFVYFWwRaa	  What do you mean by show yourself? If your not careful you could end up  having sex before your ready doing things like that at 13. |`|KXehdzkkaa	if he says that he doesnt like you, believe him. if you try to go in for a kiss and get rejected, it will ruin the night.... so try to just like him as a friend|`|LUU8v78taa	13 is kinda young for this problem lol, i know u dont want to here that but its true srry.   but just be yourself thats best   dont try to kiss him if he just wants to be friends, that could end a good friendship he knows u like him. let him seperate his feelings for u|`|MCbU6YdEaa	Be all that you can be  
iJRcdSbiaa	You care deeply for this man.  I think it's wonderful you're willing to work through these difficulties with him, in his life.  I dated someone with Bi-Polar disorder.  I know it can be difficult, however the relationship can work if they're willing to address their own mental health.  It has to come from them first.  He'll contact you again, especially if it's been his past behavior.  If he wants a relationship, set firm boundaries with him--no attempts of physical aggression or otherwise; he must take his meds; must see his psych, etc.  I would also highly recommend a therapist for yourself and a couples therapist for you both, if you both decide to work on your relationship again.  All the best to you...|`|rx0ekB9Paa	ok i only read the first few lines,but obviously he needs his meds to be upped to a higher dose. im bipolar and im never that bad,i can be verbally mean an then start crying or have 15 mood swings in 5 minutes,but i can control it. go to his next appointment with him and tell the dr about his actions.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN|`|7e8NN8saaa	Why do you want him to contact you. Take it from someone who has been there and done that - you don't want to go there. May I remind you ABUSE! Do you really want to live with that?     If he can't help himself - you certainly won't be able to. How? You have done everything you possibly can. Now all you can do is pray for him and hope he makes it.     In the meantime - move on with your life. Life can be sucky and has events like this and that is all you can do - move on.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Honey, to be blunt, he will ALWAYS be MESSED UP!!!!    People who are bipolar have lifelong issues.  Many mentally ill people hate taking the medication because of the way it makes them feel so they get off then go crazy, and the cycle continues.      I'm sorry to say this but I really don't think you should want anything to do with him.
0AWN7JNiaa	Ummmmm No he chased after you b/c he has a heart and most likley does not like seeing you cry or anyone crying. Read the book HE IS JUST NOT INTO YOU     Great book and will give you a lot of great advice!!!|`|wZk80BaGaa	it isn't always the case, i mean he could feel sorry for you. or guilty and just want to be close friends still.    in other words he is just looking after you as a friend

rhdo8JnUaa	?Quieres una respuesta sincera o la respuesta que quieres oir?.  Mira, yo se que tu quisieras en el alma que alguien te diera mil razones para justificar su distancia, para justificarte que el no este contigo, y para darte esperanzas de que en el futuro posiblemente algo pueda suceder, y que si hacer tal o cual cosa, lo vas a recuperar!. Esa persona posiblemente es la que se lleve los 10 ptos!!!...    Pero esa respuesta no ser sincera!. Tu misma nos dices lo que sabes que pasa y que deberias hacer!. En el fondo lo sabes, igual que lo sabemos todos cuando tenemos problemas del corazn, pero que igual no queremos aceptar!.     Si el te quisiera, haria lo posible por estar contigo!. Seria l el que te diria que se den la posibilidad de un reencuentro y volver, pero que solo vaya a ti por besos y por sexo solo significa que le gustas, que le atraes todavia, pero el amor creo que ya se le fue!. Tu te equivocas porque si crees que dandole tu cuerpo lo vas a convencer solamente le estas dando razones para que siga yendo a buscarte cada vez que tenga ganas de acostarse con alguien!.  Lo mejor que puedes hacer es alejarte de l, mostrarle y decirle que te hace da?o estar cerca a l porque an sientes cosas profundas, que lo mejor es que se distancien porque no quieres seguir enga?ando a tu esposo (que lo estas haciendo y tienes que verlo!), y que no crees que da?e su matrimonio por algo que l no esta contemplando en su futuro!. Tienes que decirle que tu decisin es alejarte aunque no quiueres. Que quieres luchar por algo en tu vida, y que si l no desea luchar con todas sus fuerzas por ti, que entonces tu lucharas por tu matrimonio y por recobrar esa llama que existio en l!...   Lo importante aqui son varias cosas:  1. Alejarte, no seguir torturandote con su distanciamiento y acercamiento. No padecer sus besos, caricias, y dems. No estar preguntandote que puede pasar, o porque no hace esto o aquello y dejar de justificar el porque lo hace!. En definitiva, alejarte con el claro proposito de olvidarlo (pues lo que tu tenias que hacer ya lo hiciste, y si el no se quiere acercar y luchar por lo vuestro, pues no lo puedes obligar ni "convencer"!.   2. Convencer?. No creas que con arrumacos, cari?itos y palabras de amor lo vas a conquistar!. No!. Tienes que darle shoks electricos!. Es decir, hacerle manifiesta tu intencin de no verle ms, de no contestar sus llamadas, de alejarte definitivamente de l, y con el agravante de que lo haces para olvidarlo y rehacer tu vida!. Uno solo sabe lo que tiene hasta que lo pierde, y si logras asustarlo de que te pierda (realmente, no que sean una o dos palabritas y luego tu en bandeja de plata igual que siempre!), posiblemente pueda el terminar BUSCANDOTE para decirte que no quiere ni puede alejarse de ti, y que se la jugara toda por lo vuestro. Eso si, no esperes nada de esto!. Alejate, y si te busca, bien, si no lo hace, no termines buscandolo tu, date ese tiempo para olvidarlo, pues SI NO TE BUSCA, ES PORQUE NO QUIERE NADA SERIO CONTIGO!.  3. No te muestres necesitada ni desesperada por l!. Eso solo le dara la certeza de que te tiene asegurada, y "nadie compra la vaca si la leche es gratis!". Hazle manifiesta tu madures, tu aceptacin de sus decisiones sea estar contigo o dejarte ir, y que vas a seguir tu vida, y vas a luchar por tu felicidad, sea con l o sin l!.   4. No sigas enfermandote de pensamientos que pretendan justificar lo que hace o dice. No digas cosas como: no ha tenido novia, me llama en cumplea?os, me dice que me quiere!. Lo importante es esto: si ve que te puede perder definitivamente va a actuar o a no hacerlo. Si lo hace, puedes pensar en un futuro con l. Si no lo hace, debes ser madura y aceptar que no va a pasar nada ms con l y que debes seguir tu vida!.  Pero todo esto esta sujeto a un supuesto importante: que tu tengas la fortaleza para mantenerte firme en tu distanciamiento. Si vuelves a l, a buscarlo, a llamarlo, a contestar sus llamadas, a besarlo, a tener sexo con l, solo vas a tirar a la borda todo lo que te digo, y vas a seguir dandole razones a l para que no se lo tome en serio y se cuestione sobre su relacin contigo, y vas a seguir acabando poco a poco tu matrimonio, y quedarte sin el pan y sin el queso!..   No es facil, lo s!. Pero es lo mejor y LO UNICO que puedes hacer si quieres realmente superar la tormenta!..   |`|WVA06DHjaa	Hola amiga!!! Se que cualquier cosa que escriba puede ser cierto o no, al igual que los refranes que escuchamos dia a dia. Solo te puedo decir que las mujeres somos muy importantes y no debemos dejar que jueguen con nuestris sentimientos, recuerda que el cuerpo es la morada del alma. Alejate de esa relacion que tanto da?o te hace, busca realizar cualquier actividad que te quite mucho tiempo y que no te permita pensar en el. Ya te graduaste pero puesdes seguir estudiando, lo mas importante es que lo que vayas a hacer te mantenga muy ocupada para no regalarle ni uno solo de tus pensaminetos,    Cuando una puerta se cierra se abre una ventana, quiza el verdadero amor de tu vida esta muy cerk de ti y no te haz dado  cuanta, se feliz, haz bien y no mires a quien|`|kXq54aPVaa	mira esta medio complicado el asunto si debes luchar por l porque lo amas... pero no me explico su reaccion, porque l no desea que vuelvan a estar juntos como novios, hay atraccion entre ustedes por eso tienen esas aventurillas, pero ?porque l no quiere la relacin?, creo que eso le debes preguntar a l directamente, porque tampoco vas a estar pidiendole una oportunidad toda tu vida...    *suerte*|`|kXKsb0Alaa	por lo que decs.. pareciera que solo quiere acostarse con vos. o esta con vos cuando quiere estar con vos... seria cosa de preguntarle si de verdad quiere estar con vos.... buscalo tantas veces puedas, nunca dejes derrochar ni un segundo, jamas prestes atencion a  los jueguitos de amor esos de "no lo llamo para saber si el me llama y me quiere" porque no siempre funcionan y pones a prueba el amor.    seria cosa de preguntarle definitivamente lo que preguntas aka.. pero a el, los 10 puntos se lo mereceria el al contestarte.    la cosa es quepreguntes que va a ser del futuro de ustedes dos, que ai que seguir para adelante prq de la forma q estan, no hacen ningun paso, y a la vida ai que caminarla por encima.  tambien analiza la posibilidad de q no sea solo un capricho u obsesion.    espero q todo valla bien.|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Yo creo que lo mejor es dejar tu relacion en el pasado sin lugar a dudas fue increible y aprendiste, busca a alguien que te valore lo suficiente como para que no tenga miedo de estar contigo al cien porciento.   |`|s6QV2fJ1aa	Mira sabes algo?? si quieres una respuesta sincera aqui va:  Por lo q cuentas es muy linda la historia q tienen pero no explicas exactamente el porq terminaron esa relacion de hace 8 a?os esto a lo mejor quiere decir (perdon si me equivoco) q a lo mejor tu te quieres hacerte ciega ante algo y esto pasa muy seguido en parejas q se han enamorado muy fuertemente por ejemplo: Si la pareja de alguien es muy mmm, supongamos q es muy mentiroso (a), la pareja por tanto amor q le tiene se ciega ante esto y se cree todo lo q le dice aunq sean mentiras y la pareja sepa q son mentiras pero no lo acepta.  No se si me di a entender pero espero q si. y Siguiendo con la respuesta a tu pregunta pues la verdad se puede percibir q este chico fue muy importante en tu vida hace 8 a?os, pero l ahora q lo tratas no quiere una relacion, ya sea por varios motivos, puede ser la familia como tu lo mencionas (pero como puede la familia de el ser un obstaculo a menos q tenga una familia nuclear propia, q sea padre, esposo o ya comprometido con alguien) si quieres ser feliz primero debes ver lo q sera mejor para ti y las consecuencias de tus decisiones a futuro.YO NO SOY NADIE para decirte q lo dejes o sigas con el porq la decision la tendras solamente tu y ninguna fuerza podra lograr lo contrario a lo q decidas, incluso soy algo menor q tu y no tengo del todo tu experiencia, pero aprendi por las malas q casi siempre el pasado no te dara un buen futuro, a lo q me refiero esq tu situacion es algo delicada pero tambien en un par de personas q se aman para q las cosas funcionen no debe de haber secretos, no debe de haber mentiras, y no debe de haber solo placer ni una relacion incognita. SI L TE AMA QUE TODOS LO SEPAN!!! Si no tiene nada q ocultar porq temer.  Te deseo lo mejor y como en muchos casos desearia suerte a ti en lugar de eso te deseare exito en tu vida amorosa sea o no este chico el hombre de tu vida... EXITO Y ESPERO QUE SEAS FELIZ!!!|`|dUzb4f8raa	Sabes una cosa "Kira", en instantes as somos los hombres.

A veces nosotros los hombres cuando perdemos algo y queremos recuperarlo, se nos hace algo desafiante y nos sentimos temerosos de perder de nueva esa persona. Nos sentimos flaquear a veces ante su presencia pero necesitamos un empujoncito. Debes buscar la forma de ver que es lo que le retiene por que si es asi como dices, creo que el desea estar contigo otra vez pero siente miedo de que si se juntan de nuevo pueda perder y quizas no pueda soportarlo. Intenta hablar con el al respecto o sino ve a su casa y sacale algo de informacion a su familia de que piensan si algun dia llegaran a reunirse tu y el de nuevo. Que tengas suerte, si en verdad lo amas, lucha por tu amor...
1bP4WetBaa	but thats wat u guys decided to settle with.... sex friends..!!    hm...... move on dear... u will feel lonely untill you meet your right person.. after that everything will look amusing to you...|`|nEzmoSZLaa	I know how you feel and it's hard to just move on. If he's moved on then he's not worth it. try to be strong. try talking to other guys and get into another relationship. don't let him see that you couldn't get over him, that'll just make him feel like he's some important god or something, oh and chocolate helps. (ALOT)!!!|`|bd52f8bb65af10814121d38292e675aeaa	go out with friends and have a good time meet new people or just do something by yourself that you enjoy!!|`|aEwRsnWcaa	I know exactly how you feel and then some. I'm sorry for the pain that you are going through.   The best thing you can do, when you are dying inside, is have great friends around you and/or find positive distractions to occupy your time. (like being on Yahoo Answers).   Make sure that you do someting for yourself too, like taking a fun dance class, yoga, martial arts, or even golf lessons. Get out of your usual routine by doing something new -- something for you. {and it's a great way to meet new people in your area who share a passion with you already.)    A breaking heart is so tough to hold together, I know.            It's when you get the breaking heart into a broken heart,....that's when you can really move on with your life. A broken heart is a finality. It's broken and no amount of mending will put it together again. It and you are then forever changed.    Change can be a good thing....it can open new doors for you.     What I am doing...to save myself...and not go crawling back like times before...is occupy my idle time with positive things; re doing my home inside, work, changing the furniture around in the home and buying clothes & shoes.   I'm going out with friends that I trust and keeping a positive attitude about it. Just remember, that there is nothing that you could've done better or worse. It is what it is and you and I (and others in the same boat) have to realize that there is no going back...only steps in a forward positive direction...FOR YOU! {give back to yourself-alot). - It is fun!    Enjoy your life and hold your love and devotion close to your heart until others  have proven themselves deserving/worthy of your gift of love..     You know they say,, that when you're not looking--the man of your dreams will walk in the door. God, I hope so!

7dhLr9Yeaa	There's just no guaranteed outcome or best way to find out how he feels. I would suggest that you test the waters by bringing the subject of dating up slowly, and if you ask him out, try not to make it too formal. Good luck!

Good luck!|`|R2KO2yTkaa	DON'T DO IT IN A TEXT MESSAGE. That'll only prove that you aren't brave enough to confront this in person, and maybe that was what he didn't like about you in the first place.

You are not her past enemy. Go to her house, meet her, try to be friendly. Tell her that "someone" in this area is spreading rumours and you are upset about it.

Tell coolly but firmly that you like to be friendly with her but will not hesitate to file defamation suite, if she does not stop.|`|AA12175353	Sounds like she is just bitter.

geJqeFhHaa	tell your friend that you appriciate the gesture, but you need to work things out with your girlfriend right now.  tell her thanks, but no thanks, and if she keeps tempting you- you have no choice but to break off the friendship.  maybe tell your girlfriend you want to try something new in bed, or buy some gag gifts/toys just for fun.  maybe she wants to spice things up too, but doesn't know how to approach the problem.  just try really hard with your girlfriend before you give up on her- hopefully your love means more than sex.  good luck|`|97fb8bd27531908a8196a79c851219ddaa	Once a cheater always a cheater.  You 2 are NOT meant for each other.  Get out of your relationship (you don't love each other).  And what the hell, go for the sex only - if that is what you want.  Which it sounds like it is.  Even though you say "you don't want to".  The fact that you are even thinking about it.....means you are NOT COMMITTED to your relationship of 2 years.  Move on....do what you want.  Do what you really want.  Life is too damn short to screw up yours or other peoples lives.|`|qquQbXRTaa	if your girlfriend is suicidal you should probably get help or something.....|`|R7Y1KDdUaa	wow, uhm. thats a tough one.  you need to just try and tone it done with her, a bit because either way someone gets hurt|`|PNl42AK5aa	Leave your girlfriend.

And try keep some furniture between you at all times.|`|7iXyempeaa	Ok, it's still Wednesday due, so take a deep breath and RELAX! You've still got a couple of days till Friday.....  First you should talk with your girlfriend. Don't tell her about the "hot girl", but discuss your sex life with her and find out what's going on. Suggest ways she can make it better. Then I would suggest you completely ignore the hot girl and no longer contact her if you are really tempted on friday. focus on your girlfriend; the two of you history and 2 years of love, don't give it all away just for some hot fling.|`|c136c22def4c9e03fb727ee169ec859baa	tell her it's not gonna happen! you have a girl and you respect that. then go talk to your girl. she is most likely feeling the same way on the sex thing. (been there) I LOVE MY MAN BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED A LITTLE SPICE!!!! after he and i talked it out, we started looking for what sparked the flame to begin with. and went from there. (we have also been together for 2 1/2 yrs) it is easy to fall into a rut of the same 'ol thing. just talk to your girl. you will be fine. :)|`|c18UzLXeaa	no offence but id get away from your girlfriend if she would murder you, the grl, or commit suicide she is not going to do ur life any good.  i think you should brake up with her then do what u want w/ the other;-).|`|S2w8od6zaa	I would look into help for your girlfriend!  But as for your other situation. I would try and talk to your attractive friend and just tell that you aren't interested in that type of a relationship right now, and just tell her you would rather remain friends!  Maybe if she isn't trying to get something then you won't feel like you want to as much.    Also you could look into your relationship and find out what caused the relationship to go down hill and try to deal with those problems!  If you are more infatuated with her you won't be more attracted to the other girl.|`|nNJIV44naa	Marianne Williamson|`|xds5NaAXaa	break up with her

1UmxLAAtaa	he looks at you and looks away because he has feelings for you.  Thats what guys in middle school and even high school do.|`|8j7zj9aKaa	He is likely jealous, and feeling rejected.|`|fe15b9628a40dcb0477171fa664d0d47aa	I don't know I think you'd did everything you can and you can't make him happy and the more you try the more it seems it upsets him and you just can't win here.Respect his wishes and move on you have a right to a bf and he's acting like a jerk,I don't know why you bother with him,you did more to be a friend  to him, then any other person,I ever met.He is just ungrateful and wants you to feel guilty about being happy.
30mEuBmKaa	Candy and iTunes gift card always a safe bet, if he has an iPod.|`|iYWEwg0Maa	Take him to eat, or make him his favorite dish-(guys like food).  Cologne is also a nice option, or tickets to a sports event.  If you're not looking to spend that much, make him a cd, buy him a cool hat or shirt, or get him a gift certificate to a store/restaurant/itunes, whatever his likes.  If he plays a sport, get him equipment or accessories he might not have-(if he plays golf, get him golf balls).

ohJH8t7aaa	I don't think anything is wrong with you. I think if anyone it probably has something to do with himself. Sometimes guys are scared of a good thing and then again on the other hand he likes you, but doesn't want to hurt your friendship. Only advice I could give is to sit down and tell him how you feel. It could go either direction, but I think with the way you are feeling if you don't tell him, the situation itself will continue to bother you.|`|ubrxKBntaa	because he just what some time. my god girl?|`|AA12319818	Of course there's nothing wrong with you.  Different people are attracted to different people for different reasons.  If you try to force him to have a crush on you, you're basically dooming the relationship.  Just hang out with him and enjoy your time around him.  If he eventually develops a crush on you, good for you!!!  If not, I'm sure you'll be able to find someone that's a better fit for you.|`|xmHYk2Nwaa	you're not trying hard enough.|`|rIDWoowaaa	There's nothing wrong with you, sweetheart. Really, don't think there's anything wrong with you. It's the boy! For whatever reason, he just might not like you. It's possible for a guy to, simply, just want to be friends. Maybe he does like you, he's just trying not to cling to you or anything, or he's casual about it.  Don't worry, it's not you.|`|f7LELu8Naa	2 + 2 dont always equal 4 when it come to the laws of attraction, especially for guys. Some things I've learned- 1. guys like a challenge 2. guys like mystery (dont tell them everything about yourself too fast... give them room to wonder and imagine) 3. guys need room to fall (space). It's not just about having things in common, its about anticipation and space to "want" somebody. ... perhaps you can pick on these qualities when hes talking about the other girls? Maybe he needs some room to fall for you.It would be a good sign if he missed you if you happened to become less available.|`|mPKDmMJoaa	Maybe he doesn't feel the same connection you do. Maybe he likes you more than you think and only goes with the other girls to get sex. Maybe you just aren't his type.    Don't take the blame on yourself. Men are fickle.|`|sXhmNNr6aa	Some guys are picky or they don't see your "hint hint." I think you should tell him how you feel, straight out. Also, I don't think there is anything wrong with you.|`|YAsNd5eQaa	guys r pricky and they always pick the wrong girls before they pick the right.. dont keep waiting for him, his loss : ]|`|ntFW13AUaa	You became too good of friends for him to be interested in a relationship with you. When he met you, he wanted to be friends and thats what he got. Don't take it personally like there's something wrong with you, he just wasn't looking for a relationship.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	There's nothing wrong with you. Men never see things when they are in front of them. They like the "chase" more than the "catch", so get lost for a few days, then when you see him again, he will appreciate you more.
BDtG6nhDaa	that is one of the most amazing stories i have ever heard and i think you should totally give him a chance but be careful!  and be sure that he sticks to his word. if not, then break it off. and you guys could probly still be good friends.|`|0CYvS8tiaa	Eeeekkk Hun, it depends what you want for your future. Constantly bailing out a boyfriend from jail or hospital or to focus on your education and career?|`|wvoxTwcSaa	Well if he straightens up and you really want to date him then go for it there cant be any harm in doing so. but make surethat you dont ruin your friendship in the mix of it all|`|eb6d2e59ab3c6b0c09afacdea60d9261aa	I think you should definately stay by his side now, he needs someone to talk to and know that he is loved and supported... but NOT in that way... I think you should keep it just friends, he doesn't seem like boyfriend material. Also, you should be just friends so that you can talk to him and help him through the hard time and if you take it further (become his girlfriend) then it might end up hurting both of you and ending a strong bond.|`|TMNfj4Qoaa	well if he wants to change from you i think you should give him a chance but first wait awhile to make sure that he does really change|`|PbKBvxf9aa	Well honestly you need to be very careful..obviously theres alot of things to consider...one if you care about your reputation then you have to think about that. You're going to put alot on the line for this guy that you haven't known for that long. Do you seriously think that he loves you? Thats the first question that you have to answer. How much do you care about him? Maybe you should wait until he changes his ways until you consider taking it to the second step. Be careful.|`|SQumuezfaa	im the same way im a preppy girl and think i shouldnt be with someone like that BUT im currently starting to get involved with someone that drinks used to smoke hes a player sometimes lol and has the "bad boy" image but i realized the same thing you did bc he told me he was thinking about going into the marines active duty which means he would go to war for sure i cried and now we are somewhat together i think its worth it if the thought of losing him makes you cry dont let him go|`|6aq0I30Qaa	why not give him a chance he is willing to change his ways for you. you sound like your in love you are supposed to find that person you cant live without. seems like there are a lot of feelings there. and theres nothin wrong with tattoos hun im preppy or watevs and i got one. they dont make you a bad person kk =]|`|697382a695ce98c59383f0308b0494d8aa	I think that this guy had a rude awakening and he is a changed man...

Yz5mbLlDaa	No hagas eso, es decir si la cortas diciendole la verdad, lo mas probable es que te termine odiando  lo que deberias hacer es decirle que por el momento te sentis un poco presionado y que te gustaria tener una relacion mas liberal  de esta forma le explicas que te gustaria conocer a otras chicas sin sentir compromiso con ella (tu novia), asi deberia entenderlo si es que te quiere    Decile que no sos celoso y si ella quiere experimentar pues que lo haga tambien, despues de todo son jovenes y tienen muchas cosas por las que vivir...    Pero que te quede claro, no es necesario cortarla si de verdad la queres, porque es muy posible que ya nunca quiera volver, siempre hablale con la verdad,   pero recuerda que est :     "la verdad =(  "    y "la verdad =) "    Saludos y mucha suerte con eso !!|`|035f52d3837ee4a9d5f23abf7012aaaaaa	No m.a.m.e.s.

AA10716193	perhaps not precisely in love, but at least giving herself the chance to deal with people she use to reject.  To say LOVE I think you should see other details more than just repulse or not.|`|8zIb11p7aa	it depends how she acts around him  
3ILRBXlRaa	You know "dating" also means he's probably sleeping with her too.  You still want to get back with him after that?     I mean it doesn't sound like he wants to get back with you.  Maybe you should just move on and stop worrying about him coming back and worry about your own future.  Get out there and date.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Isn't it funny how we get along after the divorce, we seem to forget the pain of living together.  I think it is nice that your still hoping, but it is obvious that he is moving on, so I feel it is only fair that you do the same thing also.  Just stay in touch when some involves your son, other than that he has his life and you have yours.  Good luck.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Move on. If after over a year of trying to work on things he still went to another woman, I'd say he's not interested. Best thing you can do is move on and try to date someone else. He will see that and either realize he wants you and come back to you (which is what you want) or you will find someone better suited to you. Both win win :-) |`|SBBnWsJJaa	Tell him that you still have feelings for him and would like to try again.|`|scMMpPciaa	I remarried my first husband 10 years later after our first marriage failed. We also moved on and remarried other people after the first marriage.    Love always wins in the end.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	y is he your ex...I would ask that 1st...di you leave him...or did he leave you...what happened...we dont know so all these details you have to think about before making any assumptions. |`|VEXKm1Obaa	Move one. Two years is a long time, and even more so if he is dating. That should give you the answer right there, if he wanted to work things out he wouldnt be dating other chicks.|`|hCAQ6aWWaa	Move on|`|agLImxKTaa	You have no future with him other than a co-parenting one.      Move on, be happy.  Whatever caused the break, is still going to be a reason to break up again.  People get back and break up so many times before actually meaning it...  all that does is delay the inevitable.|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	The relationship you have with your baby's daddy is what it is and he will always be your baby's daddy, so you will always have feelings for him, but, "meeting up" when he has someone else, well, what are you a baby's momma with privileges?  Think of yourself when it comes to your feelings as well as your needs, what you allow is what you get.  God Bless.|`|gReMjWxoaa	Don't wait around on him.  He obviously didn't wait around on you, so why should you treat him any differently?    It's fine if you would still like to casually see him and other men at the same time, but I wouldn't write off any potentially serious relationships because you're holding onto hope for him, ya know?|`|zvP53EdZaa	Just let him go.  You are hurting yourself by holding on.  If you "meet up" occasionally you are making it worse for yourself if you still have feelings for him.  Continue to be friends for the sake of your son.  You never know what could happen -  but live your life for you and your son now.  |`|rSiWjO42aa	Whoa! Brings back memories. I was in the same situation and I really feel for you. There is nothing that is going to take away the feelings you have for him, trust me. You said you were going to work things out so I am taking it that you didn't. For whatever reason, you need to find a way to move on with your life. I think that will be the hard part. Since he has a gf now you need to start dating or do something to fill your time with more important things in your life. Starting a hobby, join a club, get more involved in your son's life and make him a priority right now.  You won't believe what that will do for your self esteem not to mention if he still has feelings for you they will present themselves very prominently.   What you do with it from there is up to you of course. It's great that you are civil for your son's sake, it helps tremendously and he needs a father figure in his life.  Since you do still have feelings for him that is why it is weighing on your mind right now that he is seeing someone.  It is hurtful and it just makes your feelings even stronger for him.   My best advice to you would be to move on since you haven't worked things out and it has been 2 years already.  I say this because if you still "meet up" with him once in awhile that is only doing a disservice to you both. I know easier said than done! Get busy with your son and focus everything you can on him. He is still young and very impressionable, you can help him and yourself by finding the sports, activities & interests that you both enjoy. Believe me, you will reap the benefits in the future in more than one way.    I am envious as I never had a boy, 4 girls, but I have 5 grandsons and I love them to death!  Good luck, I hope I helped in some small way.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	You probably are getting along well because you are not living together. I think that it's great that you are trying to get along for the sake of your son. Unfortunately, it sounds like he has moved on in his life by dating someone else. You need to move on also.   However, your priority should be your son, so be very careful about your relationships in the future and who you bring into your son's life. He is already going to be confused about having a mommy and daddy who don't both live with him. Try not to let any new men in your life assume a father-figure role for him.  Especially if the ex is still in the picture and involved in his life.   It's unfortunate that in our society most people think that it's okay to have children without being married and having the security of a home with two parents in it.  I always feel bad for children caught in that situation that is not their fault. Too many people don't think before they bring children into this world.|`|AA11481431	looks like he has moved on and your still waiting around. Don't wait too long or good things will pass you by. If he still wants to "meet up" and is with this other girl he may just want you as a back up. You both need to be open and honest with each other.|`|a74f327928f03cd6f7cdfe41424be5e9aa	HI I went through that already my ex is witha girl 10 years younger then him. and my 7 year old son is there.  I told him myfeelings but when they find someone else  they treat you like  your feeling mean nothing. all I can say is just move on. I have had a hard time with  this myself and I just find just keeping busy and happy is the best. your child is the only one that  matters. good luck to you|`|AA10716193	it seems that he has al rights to do his own life as a person.    You choosed to keep feelings for him and that is a personal decision of yours, but has nothing to do with him.    It seems that you will need to resist this relation he has now, OR FIGHT FOR HIM.    it is perfect that You are now in order as persons trying to build a nice life for your son, but that is all. It is perfect that you have positive feelings for him, but that is all.  And it Sounds great if he is doing his life with a next person after getting separated, but that is all.    Things are OK as they are now.    You have a wish, an idea, feelings, and there is where the possibilities are making some noise, giving you matters to think about.    I would say that you can give him to experience this chance he is taking, and in the meanwhile you can be patient, passive and see how it goes.  If you feel you cannot resist, that you need to RECOVER him and that it can work out, and that is a good idea, and not only jealous or possessive attitude, then, make your moves.    Anyway, if you are now good friends, you can keep things like this, as you know the famous sentence: we never know what we have until we loose it. And by now you have a good friend and is the father of your son.    |`|Gr62VECpaa	move on!!!!!!!

gCgxi5kvaa	Nothing is different but the fact that you made it a date. Hanging out with someone inplies that you are just buddies not looking for more.

Then it will be a date.|`|sYRBS6cTaa	whoever asked pays for both of you......|`|GiEinn85aa	date is between you and the person you love, sharing your love with them.  hanging out is between you and your friend or buddy just having fun.     ask him/her to make sure if you guys are goin out or not.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	A date is a test to see if the person is worth dating.

It will just be you two     2. If he wants to call it a date than i would guess hes probably trying to make it so he's in a position where he can possible ask you out.
5a47bc2648f4b8836b41ab40ec377e25aa	If you don't like "kissing and stuff" you shouldn't have a boyfriend. It isn't going to be any different than last year -- he's only going to want more "stuff". If you don't like someone all over you, trying to kiss you, what's the point of having a boyfriend? For status? Companionship? You can get that better from your girl friends. Guys your age just want to brag to their friends about the "stuff" they're doing with their girlfriends.     Have fun with your friends and concentrate on school. Forget about boyfriends, they're just a bunch of trouble. Or just find a boyfriend who is really into school rather than kissing.

I fhe is seeing some one else,there's nothing that you could do anyway.He may be keeping them "in reserve" in case he can't have you.Brutal but true.If you set some sort of rule in that way you are commiting yourself and him to the result of your cancer treatment.You are not even sure of that right now.         You might even seek the counsel of a support group but the answer is in you .         I am in touch with my X and she has cancer too.I only hope that I can give her some support.We will never get back together but she's a human being and deserves that much....maybe he thinks that too.

That way it is a win win situation because he wont have to spend too much on you and look like a cheapskate but therefore, at least he would do something for you and treat you to something and not just a walk in the park. |`|16F7DelAaa	I think that museums are the best for first dates because there is plenty to talk about and that pretty much eliminates the possibility of the dreaded awkward  silence. I went on a first date to a children's museum and it was really fun.|`|8fnqSJHqaa	go bowling |`|uXepiWJtaa	you could go out to a nice clean pub if youre of age..|`|t3fagnRtaa	i would say movies  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|dcTr0k1Caa	THE MOVIES   DUHHH!  :)|`|jYZUrx3eaa	bowling then a dinner|`|6SUlBfliaa	- Sightseeing  - Exercising at a park or some trail (not too far from civilization, heh)|`|G8X9ugwdaa	HOOTERS|`|kOWjGdDsaa	Go to a restaurant, or the movies...!

Just google comedy clubs in your city, I'm sure you'll have several to choose from.  It's usually fairly cheap (between $10 - $15 per person) plus everyone likes to laugh and it'll give you something to talk about afterwards.  I just went to one on Saturday and it was amazing! :)|`|8KZJODbTaa	you guys deff need to have a good time,  you know make it memorable   for a first date    :)    I say go to put-put or lazertag  or maybe carnival  sounds corney but you are on a first date  nothing to serious  but still fun and small                  |`|gbyt8HU4aa	go on the internet and have a date just chating    all my real dates have been on the internet and I have about 12 girl friends on all kind of chat |`|LuCzF3Q6aa	go play mini golf, theme park, ice skating rink, the zoo, a concert.|`|s9JNVDDxaa	You don't say how old you are (drinking age?) or where you live, so that makes it difficult. I'll assume you are under 21 and somewhere in North America.    Yes, and I saw "no movies".     You said, "hanging out", which sounds like you don't want an active date like a hike to the falls, biking some rough single track, or kayaking class three rapids.    Here are some ideas:  - Service date: The food banks nearly always need a hand packing boxes of food.   - Education date: Find a dance, art, or cooking class that you will all find interesting. It isn't as dorky as it sounds.  - Iron chef date: Have a third party select a "secret ingredient" and have it waiting at your place. Both couples must make two dishes using the secret ingredient and items in the kitchen.  - We're just looking date: Go to a nice store and try on fancy or formal clothes.  - Paper airplane date: Get a couple of books from the library about paper airplanes. Find a good location at a park and a stack of paper. See who can make the farthest flight, the most accurate, etc.  - I'm a star date: If you have a video camera or can borrow one, make a silly movie and put it on YouTube.    Use your imagination. Have fun. Be safe.  
AA11113523	im going ot be honest.  he is definitely flirting, but the boy sounds like a player.  hes going to try to make u feel special, but hes also trying to make other girls feel special at the same time.  if i were you, i would try my hardest to get over him. he sounds like hes not going to bring you much happiness, only heart ache and jealousy.   believe me, chances r, ur friends r going ot start likin him too, and thats gonna ruin ur friendship.  sisters before misters.  dont forge that.  
aymBTRlyaa	Sounds like you are jealous and don't want to know that he is doing good with out you.   If it hurts/angers you this much, then don't talk to your ex anymore. Plain and simple....unless you have kids, which I doubt because you both seem to be males. |`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He tells you because you let him.  If you don't want to hear about it, don't talk to him.  It's not rocket science.|`|AA11604319	He continues to do it because you continue to listen.  HANG UP THE PHONE when he gets off on a subject you don't want to hear.|`|tbJraueLaa	he wants break up sex.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Because you keep listening.. If he goes off about his life, end the conversation. You keep listening, so he keeps talking|`|9CKrP9Keaa	DUH! Why are you talking to him. If it's over, then it's over. Stop talking to him and stop your whining. |`|ZVuwz1bMaa	He clearly doesn't want to let go and finds some security in still talking to  you. This is his way of coming to terms with the split. Don't answer his calls, avoid talking at all costs, even emails. He'll soon get the picture.    Move on up and move on out.|`|Fj5lVHAUaa	sounds like he is trying to keep a link with you.so he can find out whats happening|`|IZTmipyaaa	Thanks for these 2 points!|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	My ex used to do the same thing.  What he was doing was staying in touch with me so he could keep his options opened in the event that things didn't work out with the chick he dumped me for!  I was stupid enough to go along with it for awhile, until finally I flat out told him don't call me anymore.  Ever.  You need to do the same.  You can't move on with him in your face all the time.  Tell him you really don'[t care about his life any more.  |`|TbENA08baa	Why do you even talk to him then?  block his calls.|`|X3gbFDnDaa	You should try to end your relationship all together.  He probably is hoping for some reconciliation!  From experience.....when you do start dating again Ex's are no good for either one of you!|`|gjCMWY9vaa	Because you keep listening.    Hang up the phone or walk away. You don't want to hear it and you don't have to if you leave the conversation.    cheers  |`|fYv0dtUFaa	I'm sort of in the same boat as you except I am the one who broke up with him, about 7 months ago.  The other day he sent me an email telling me how great he's doing and told me about the new person he is seeing, like I care.  In my case I know he is just trying to make me feel bad...in your case it could be the same thing or maybe he thinks you two are still friends and its ok for him to tell you things.  If you tell him you don't want to hear about it and he still insists on telling you best thing to do is just avoid him.  Thats what I've had to do.|`|9cXmPQyPaa	I think you kinda answered your own question. He knows you don't want to know what he has to say. He may interpret this because you may be jealous, anxious or upset by what he gets up to even if this isn't the case. Maybe ignore it when he volunteers this information. He is obviously doing it as he wants it to affect you in some way. So show that it doesn't bother you. He should soon realise what an unselfish idiot he's being, and stop. If he doesn't then you can see how better off you are without him.|`|9K0W15zQaa	avoid him at all possible times and block his phone number(s)...
mIHmDSkuaa	Try pherlure... Its a pharamone spray that hightens a womans sense of arousal. No work needed. Although flowers would be nice.  If all else fails try different stuff. Keep it spicy and make sure she is completely fulfilled so she'll always want more. If you dont mind a rather personal suggestion (despite the fact your posted this online) "eating out" isn't a bad way to kick off the night!|`|fMEypXDYaa	Guess that means you two didn't have sex before the marrage, huh? Well I suggest that you two sit down and have a long talk about your sexually relationship and ask her what she expect's from you sex wise and tell her what you expect from her sex wise. Seems to me that she may just be scared to have sex because she might not want kids at this point, your too rough with her, want things she don't understands about, you need to find out from her.  There are helpful websites and books on this subject that you both can access and watch together or read together, and I don't mean just 'x-rated' sites or hard core porno, but serious discussion about this matter.|`|yI9uOxXVaa	Welcome to marriage.    Check out this site and purchase this book. nymphowife.com    It will help.    |`|69c7790e3379085aad578068a14e805eaa	I love my husband with all my heart & soul and we've been married 25 years and relations are, for the most part, on the back burner.   I don't understand why people seem to think sex is the only thing in marriage when there's so much more.  Sure, it's nice & important but I've talked to my Dr. and I understand my own situation.    Sure, I enjoy it but I love my spouse more than the act of sex itself.    Do you believe in "sex therapists" .  Personally, I don't but that's an avenue you may wish to discuss/follow.    |`|9K0W15zQaa	ask her what she likes and then maybe she'll get in the mood more often with you and will feel more comfortable...
d2786c44edfd4f02806b557236eeee8eaa	well i dont know , but i dont blame u for feeling that way, i know what u r going though, u need to confront him nicely, and tell him if he dont quit its over ,if he loves u , he will do whats best.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Looking at porn isn't cheating.  Chatting with strange women over the net after your wife has gone to bed and then keeping it a secret is cheating.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	You sound pretty controlling.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Get keylogging software and install it on his computer.

I use them all the time.|`|yj4lTnxuaa	cant you wake up in the middle of the night and sneak up behind him to see what he's looking at? lol|`|Fj5lVHAUaa	i dont think looking at porn is cheating.  my husband does it all the time(not that i like it) i just block it out  virtual flirting isn't cheating either|`|F0rbWQL8aa	Mine did it, too but he has stopped after we went to counseling to work through all of our issues.  Check the cookies, he may not be deleting them and you can usually tell what sites he visited by looking at them.  If you delete the cookies each night, you can see what he did the next night.  This might be an option before you try spyware.  Talk to him and let him know how you feel about porn.  Until you work on all your issues though, he will just find better ways to hide what he is doing.|`|ozT1kjdzaa	yes hes cheating|`|598c678d1ecdedce69c770123bbb4506aa	Well I'm going through something similar.  Not porn but the s/o is spending an awful amount of time on personals sites! Personals sites? While in love with me? Homie don't play that.    I tried trusting for a few weeks/months but finally I created a fake account and made contact.  It was all sex and where do you stay and how can we get into contact.      After finding the above out I confronted the situation directly and was promised it was all talk and nothing was ever done with anyone.  I'm still mullling over whether to accept this farfetched answer or just wipe my hands of this person.  Who says such sexually charged things when they have someone?    So I say he is either playing with others (flirting and leading them on) but staying faithful... which is crazy and maybe he should seek help.    Or he is playing around on YOU and looking for sex with others... which is crazy and you should break up.|`|bLARMYAfaa	Watch porn with him together--I'm sure he'd enjoy it more with you. Perhaps he also feels lonely. Some married women start finding a discount shoe sale in Lee, Massachusetts more exhilarating that sex with their hubby--and then wonder why he's watching porn. In any case, watching is not cheating.    About installing those secret programs that some advice you to do--be careful. It's like him putting a bug in your handbag. How would you feel about that? Spyware and bugs are an absolute killer for a relationship. |`|ad88458a32c6157abe9a152af82270f4aa	Go to the beginning of the web address *box* and after the // type in a...all sorts of web sights that your computer 'remembers being' will come up. Do that through the alphabet and you will see every where any ones been on the new in your home.|`|Zc6faWhyaa	been there, done that. search google for a free trial of a Key Logger (unless you want to buy it, its not too expensive) they usually have 15-30 day free trials. you can go through all them and find one that you like. some are completely unnoticeable on the computer so he would never suspect a thing. they will take a picture of the computer screen ever couple seconds so you can see everything thats done. and they tell you every key that is pressed so you will be able to see what he is typing and even get his passwords to his email. but the thing is, since its only a free trial it will only record for 60 minutes and you have to start it. so right before you go to bed start it up.|`|9K0W15zQaa	if its only porn then no it's not cheating..if it bothers you then tell him or put a block. maybe you can even suggest to watch it together if he's addicted and that will let him open up to you and not hide it anymore|`|nsIXs1BLaa	Looking at porn is not cheating. thats wat guys do, now cheatinf is txing n cahiting online just dnt tell him nothing n spy on him intill u have prove. to me his just probably being a guy looking is not bad. just realx and spy on him learn how to c the deleted history. HIS UR HUBY u have the rite to know wat his doing!! good luck hope is not the worst.

FiCl71flaa	I can not come up with the words to console you on your loss which appears to have happened on New Years day.  The pain you are now feeling and your sorrow can only be understood by someone who has suffered a similar loss. Because of the newness of your loss, it is not possible for you to know what to do now since you are very confused right now and are not in a mental or emotional state to be making any type of cogent decision.My suggestion is to mourn him in your own way  and at your own pace;however, do not ignore the people in your life who care about you and him;people like his family, your family, common friends, and other friends. Use whatever means is at your disposal until the pain starts to abate. Finally , though it may sound like a cliche, time is the best healer. I wish you all the best and GOD's blessings.|`|xPxm8ONiaa	Just grieve like everyone else does.|`|ENA7czaaaa	I would say sorry, but I hate it when people give me pity. But eh. I'm sorry for your loss... Just... Do what everyone else does. Cry. It'll help get rid of the pain. You might not get over him, but you will move on. Don't worry. |`|BLAh7eFgaa	if this is real, and it happened to me, yahoo answers would be one of the last places i'd hang around.|`|AA10941788	Grieve!!! Pray to God for peace.

Try not to think too much, and to write your feelings down.  There are many feelings people have after someone dies, even anger at them even for leaving.  All your feelings are okay to have.  Maybe organize a gathering at a later date where you and your friends can have a casual memorial service so you can talk about all he meant to you.  That will give you something to do to get through this period.  At the gathering, have his favorite foods and talk about good times together.|`|wsMneVr9aa	Pursue necrophilia.|`|jXya2ggWaa	if you truly loved him, then your life will never be the same. I'm sorry.

I'll keep you in my prayers. :)  Try to remember all the good times you two had together.  Don't worry about moving on and trying to find another guy, or dating, for a while.  You need to give yourself time to grieve, mourn, and just cry. It's completely normal to do that, and you should.  Holding your emotion in won't be good for you.  Spend time with his family and friends, those who are mourning a loss as well.  And make sure you have a good support system--friends, family, etc.  Let them know that you are dealign with a terrble loss and need support and encouragment.    And, don't give up on life.  He wouldn't have wanted you to just stop everything and lay around and be sad forever.  Pick up a new hobby, join a club somewhere, take cooking classes, anything to keep yourself busy after you've given yourself time to mourn.  Volunteer somewhere, so you have a committment to others, and you'll be more likely to want to get up out of bed every morning if you know that others are counting on you.    Hang in there, things will get better.  It might be raining now, but it can't storm forever.  God will protect you, pray for him to heal you.  I'll be keeping you in my prayers as well. :)|`|RoB4p8d2aa	oh, im so sorry.  be sad for awhile but if being sad and depressed becomes your life you should think about what he would want you to do.

Don't ever forget about him.|`|iEJOVxlKaa	I'm so sorry. The best thing you can do is just cry. You don't want to bottle up your feelings because that just makes everything worse. Then once you're over the shock and mourning, just move on with your life.

I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope you find happiness again, because I'm sure that is what he'd want but for now just let your emotions do what they want.

OMKjo5plaa	I'm spending about 3000-3800 on my wedding with the guest list at 170.  So maybe 25,000.  I guess it is based on how big you want it.  You could probably do a lot of decorations yourself, have family help with some of the food.  You can really make any amount work you just have to know where to cut the cost.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	This really depends upon where you live because costs can very so greatly and guest count is a multiplier for food costs.  My 150 guest wedding in Central PA (a moderately price area) is running me $18k.  Your guest count is more than double mine and your estimate of $30k isn't double my costs so I'd say you are doing pretty well.    If you live near a really high priced area (LA, New York), I'd say that many guests would cost you around $50-grand.    If the family is questioning the amounts, then show them the guest list that adds up to 400 invitees and the budget that goes along with it.    I'd love to know where KellyR lives "$10-$20 per plate" - - that made me laugh!  That might get a big mac where I live.  The cheapest rate at my venue is for hors d'ourves and is $30 per plate.

If you want a sit down dinner your probably looking between $10-$20 a plate. You just need to weigh your options and see whats important to you and whats not. $30,000 is a good amount if your smart on planning and get creative.|`|SmWxP86yaa	It will be tough, but depending on location and things, as to what type of , items and such. Ok, here is the other issue, are you sending out 200 invites for 400 to come or 400 of them, Because you may have way more than budgeted for...If you give more details as to sit down, buffet, location, ceremony and reception in different in same location, It can be done, but you will have to be opened minded on lots of things,,,|`|fc4NOCp3aa	It depends on alot of things really.  You CAN have a wedding of that size for less probably but you'd have to go pretty cheap.  I mean, we only had around 100 guests and mine was still $13k!  I think $30,000 is very average for a wedding of that size.  Here's a tip - hire a good wedding planner because even though, at first, it seems like a big luxury, it ends up saving you some money because they are in a much better position to negotiate with better vendors than perhaps you could afford. They call in favors & stuff like that.|`|p0ly7Oinaa	I had only 100 people at my wedding and the whole day cost about 10,000 in all.  I'd guess yours, for 4x the people, would cost at least 25,000!!!!!!|`|o7lAXurcaa	We are having around the same amount of people come to our wedding. We are averaging 25,000 for the hall. And all the other things that come with it as well. Dress, flowers, honeymoon, rings, photographer, video etc. We are looking around 50,000 with everything!!

Les cons respecteront, ou pas, scrupuleusement les rgles de la communaut, mais dans tous les cas ils jetteront la pierre  quiconque s'en cartera. Les autres feront preuve de tolrance, que ce soient parce qu'ils auront appris  accepter les faiblesses d'autrui, ou parce qu'ils seront  cheval sur certains principes, mais pas sur l'emballage cadeau qu'il y a autour.     Oublie les premiers, ils ne voudront pas de toi, et honntement, tant mieux pour toi! Les autres ne cautionneront peut tre pas particulirement certains de tes actes passs, mais ils s'intresseront  ce que tu es maintenant, et t'accepteront telle que tu es. Je te souhaite de ne plus rencontrer que des gens comme ?a.    Ceci tant, quand on s'estime peu, on attire les gens qui ont peu d'estime pour nous. Et quand on se respecte, on attire le respect. Coucher, c'est comme toutes les choses de la vie : parfois, on fait des erreurs, on apprend. Personne n'est parfait, on se trompe tous, le truc c'est de le reconnaitre, de s'efforcer de faire mieux par la suite, et de se pardonner, sans masochisme ni condescendance. Un individu a profit de toi, de ta faiblesse momentane, il t'a casse comme le font les individus dans son genre. Mais le problme c'est lui, pas toi, ne te laisse pas enfermer dans l'image qu'il a voulu te donner de toi!

Question: "Que dit la Bible du divorce et du remariage?"    Rponse: Tout d'abord, peu importe le point de vue que nous ayons sur la question du divorce, il est important de se rappeler les mots de la Bible de Malachie 2:16a : je hais la rpudiation, Dit l'ternel, le Dieu d'Isra?l. Selon la Bible, pour Dieu le mariage doit tre un engagement  vie. Ainsi ils ne sont plus deux, mais ils sont une seule chair. Que l'homme donc ne spare pas ce que Dieu a joint. (Matthieu 19:6). Dieu comprend, cependant, que puisqu'un mariage implique deux personnes coupables, un divorce peut arriver. Dans l'Ancien Testament, Il a fix quelques lois pour protger les droits des divorcs, particulirement des femmes (Deutronome 24:1-4). Jsus a dit que l'on a donn ces lois  cause de la duret des c?urs, pas parce que ctait le dsir de Dieu (Matthieu 19:8).    La controverse si on permet le divorce et le remariage selon la Bible tourne principalement autour des mots de Jsus dans Matthieu 5:32 et 19:9. L'expression  part l'infidlit matrimoniale est la seule chose dans l'Ecriture sainte qui donne peut-tre la permission de Dieu pour le divorce et le remariage. Beaucoup d'interprtes comprennent cette "clause d'exception" comme se rfrant " l'infidlit matrimoniale" pendant la priode "des fian?ailles". Dans la tradition juive, on considre un homme et une femme maris mme lorsqu'ils sont "fiancs". L'immoralit pendant cette priode "de fian?ailles" serait alors la seule raison valable d'un divorce.    Cependant, le mot grec qui traduit l'infidlit matrimoniale est un mot qui peut signifier n'importe quelle forme d'immoralit sexuelle. Il peut signifier la fornication, la prostitution, l'adultre, etc. Jsus dit probablement que le divorce est permis si l'immoralit sexuelle est commise. Les rapports sexuels sont une partie intgrante du lien matrimonial, les deux deviendront une chair (Gense 2:24; Matthieu 19:5; phsiens 5:31). Donc, une rupture de ce lien par des rapports sexuels  l'extrieur du mariage pourrait tre une raison permise du divorce. S'il en est ainsi, Jsus a aussi le remariage  l'esprit dans ce passage. L'expression et pouse un autre (Matthieu 19:9) indique que l'on permet le divorce et le remariage dans un cas de la clause d'exception, quelle que soit la manire de linterprter. Il est important de noter que lon permet seulement  la partie innocente de se remarier. Bien que ?a ne se trouve pas dans le texte, permettre le remariage aprs un divorce est la piti de Dieu pour celui contre qui lon a pch, pas pour celui qui a commis l'immoralit sexuelle. Il peut y avoir des cas o lon permet " la partie coupable" de se remarier - mais un tel concept ne se trouve pas dans ce texte.    Certains comprennent 1 Corinthiens 7:15 comme une autre "exception", permettant le remariage si un conjoint non croyant divorce davec un croyant. Cependant, le contexte ne mentionne pas de remariage, mais dit seulement qu'un croyant ne doit pas ncessairement continuer un mariage si un conjoint non croyant veut partir. D'autres prtendent que l'abus (conjugal ou de l'enfant) est lune des raisons valables de divorce, bien que ce ne soit pas crit comme tel dans la Bible. Mme si cela peut trs bien tre le cas, il n'est jamais sage de prsumer sur la Parole de Dieu.    Parfois perdu dans le dbat sur la clause d'exception, il faut souligner le fait qu'indpendamment de la signification de l'infidlit matrimoniale, c'est une permission pour le divorce, pas une condition pour le divorce. Mme quand il y a adultre, un couple peut, par la grace de Dieu, apprendre  pardonner et commencer  reconstruire leur mariage. Dieu nous a pardonns bien plus. Nous pouvons certainement suivre Son exemple et pardonner mme le pch d'adultre (phsiens 4:32). Cependant, dans beaucoup de cas, un conjoint est non repenti et continue dans l'immoralit sexuelle. C'est l o Matthieu 19:9 peut probablement sappliquer. Beaucoup pensent aussi trop rapidement au remariage aprs un divorce alors que Dieu pourrait vouloir qu'ils restent seuls. Dieu appelle parfois une personne  tre seule pour que son attention ne soit pas divise (1 Corinthiens 7:32-35). Le remariage aprs un divorce peut tre une option dans quelques circonstances, mais cela ne signifie pas que c'est la seule option.    Cest affligeant de voir que le taux de divorce parmi les Chrtiens est presque aussi lev que celui du monde non croyant. La Bible montre parfaitement que Dieu dteste le divorce (Malachie 2:16) et que la rconciliation et le pardon devraient faire partie de la vie d'un croyant (Luc 11:4; phsiens 4:32). Cependant, Dieu reconna?t que des divorces peuvent se produire, mme parmi Ses enfants. Un croyant divorc et/ou remari ne devrait pas se sentir moins aim de Dieu, mme si son divorce et/ou remariage n'est pas couvert par la possible clause d'exception de Matt|`|0c7307aca0c34cd5adfd9987aaab5e83aa	d'abord ma chere zohra promettez a vous meme et a dieu que jamais vous ne referez pareilles betises ,,,soyez plus adultes,, rflchissez avent d'agire.. soyez plus mure...si vous faites ?a , soyez en sur que dieu vous pardonnera...mais ne retombez jamais dans le meme panneau... les bons musulmans viendront surment frapper a votre porte... seulement soyez en une vous aussi...bonne chance|`|NYvuT8vTaa	quitte se mec que t aime pas rien ne t' oblige  rester  ces cots coucher avec un mec avant le mariage je sais bien que en islam c' interdit  je sais pas se qu'il faut que tu fasse pour qu'il te pardonne dsoler et on plus comme on te l'a dis dj tu sais pas de qui tu seras amoureuse et tu voudras te marier avec lui|`|ke9h3b7naa	Je crois bien que ma reponse pourra tant soit peu vous airder  .

VLRkJOOuaa	If you share a sincere, close relationship with your Vice Principal, I'm sure you could easily convince him to not punish your ex -- yet, at least. Tell him you guys will settle it sometime. And if he doesn't believe that, you have no choice but to lie; tell him you guys are getting back together... and it's what you wanted from the start, apparently.      If not the first, this might help too.    Warn your ex about his possible suspension, etc. Tell him "I've told the Vice Principal about what you've been doing. Babe, I'm sorry it's come to this... really. But you left me no choice; I'm doing this for you."      If you're able to tell him before the Vice Principal makes any immediate actions involving him (and possibly his parents), you'll be able to eliminate the factor of his surprise. At least he won't be like "what?!? I'm gonna kill her! >:|"    He could, possibly, actually re-think what he's doing if you were able to warn him first.      Good luck! (:|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	IGNORE, don't speak a word.    If he continues, if a crowd is around, say GET AWAY! loud enough to get others' attention and then walk off.    Use the same technique.

I would follow up with the principle on what you should do.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Only get a restraining order/switch schools/contact the police if things start getting serious. Those are drastic decisions, and aren't quite necessary just yet. I'm not sure what the consequences would be, but if he's making you uncomfortable, than they're definately worth it as long as they keep him away from you. If things continue, I'd keep contacting your principal. And, if ever necessary, move to more drastic decisions. And make sure someone always keeps an eye on him when he's around you.
joA5Rcyzaa	yes, but most likely he likes you|`|Uc6bhUraaa	he likes you|`|OMW2LftJaa	No|`|5POoQJVpaa	Things you listed that I WOULD (depending on the closeness of our friendship) do, if I did NOT see her as more than a friend:  -talk to her every time I see her  -talk to her every time we're both on Facebook. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't talk to a girl I was interested in every time I log on.  -talk to her about almost anything. This obviously depends on how close we are, but I have a girl-friend whom I can tell anything, and do. HOWEVER, if there was a girl I liked, I probably WON'T tell her everything.  -smile every time I see her? This varies from guy to guy, depending on personality. I wouldn't smile, per se, at my girl-friends, but I would make some sort of face.  -say flirty things. again, it's because of my personality.  -"jokingly" tell her she doesn't need beauty sleep. Actually, I wouldn't say that because it's cheezy lol.    Things I would ONLY do for a girl I was interested in:  -spend the day walking around school with her, after school is done  -smile all the time  -actually listen to her. this is a huge hint that he could be interested in you    Hope he likes you
W7DhZSy3aa	Dont worry about it, when you get older and you are out of school, all of these petty things wont matter anymore..... hang in there and just be yourself....
uff3kOoFaa	i know the exact feeling. it sucks. just try to talk to him. become friends. eventually you could tell him, or maybe he'll make the first move. be strong. give it a shot. he wont bite your head off lol. good luck!
H7ecdHDyaa	I wear the same size, us curvy girls cant help but be higher in size oj jeans it only matters on what their ? is like|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	well. if i was size 50 as a guy i'd think hell yea!!! ooof baby baybee!!!              but im not.  i say.  she's as skinny as her mind wants her to be.|`|y8mkxmcfaa	It matters on how old you are. I am 12 and I am size 00. My mom is 40 and is size 5|`|R0U4qy6haa	what is a 13 in men sizes??? dont know womens sizes|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Do do know that no guy knows what a size 13 is, right?  (guys don't even know there own size)    13 does not sound so big...
dd235370a6c4569337cc8a8e1d335770aa	tell him, them kiss him and kick him the nutts|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	well if you guys havent really talked before then just start asking him little stuff and try to get to know him. then once you know him start hanging out with him and then go from there  and if you have talked to him a lot and know him then just start being flirty with him, like act like you like him and stuff but dont just straight up  say it. and if you think he likes you then try playing hard to get. guys like it when they have a little chase ;)|`|oidfmtnYaa	poop on me!    eahwhahhahahahahahha!!!|`|MzSFaebraa	I would want a girl to say..''You're cute..Go to the movies with me on Saturday?''|`|Mq2TYEJYaa	be amaizingly blunt and to the point    blurt it out and say it usualy works the best no one ends up confused|`|WFRooU7Maa	Talk about something you have in common  Maybe lean against him a little, thats a pretty good sign|`|fLj7ynSjaa	well you should talk about how you feel and see what he says and see where the convo goes from their|`|jgf6RDPSaa	Take the jump and just ask him out, nothing ventured nothing gained.
6Y9zWhvHaa	ring him up and say that your coming over and would love to catch up. ask to go out for a drink. good luck.|`|KVCkcMokaa	Ring him up and tell him your coming to the country and you would love to catch up...thats all!  Or if you want more then, ask him to meet up and go to dinner one night?  Or if you just want to fool around be up front...?    Not that thats what you want to do but there is a few options lol...have fun!
01yBLHvWaa	your right it is a little weird. but i say if you feel comfortable talking to him as a friend what does one more friend hurt? on the other hand if he calls you and decides to tell you he likes you its a diff. story because he did say he liked your friend & it would be kind of messed up that hes telling you...    over-all though your only 14 i wouldnt worry about it ;]
xccRugjHaa	It's a little nerve racking to approach a girl and start up a conversation.  It's much more nerve racking if that girl is not alone.  It's like the guy is on stage performing and the more people there are around, the more like he is to get nervous.    The easiest way to get a guy to talk to you is to walk up to him and initiate the conversation.  It takes all of the guess work away and the guy will be more at ease.
Sv62SsxXaa	you look irish and about 16 or 17.|`|KfQKvToqaa	You look like you're about 15 - 18 years old. You just look white. Maybe Irish with some German?|`|dsiuzvTHaa	u look about 17 or 18, look good about an 8, maybe irish or white, i wouldn't mind dating you|`|nR4VjIHpaa	pretty 18-19 year old white girl.|`|s70NgxPLaa	16 year old white girl...|`|xR3F2RFnaa	ulook around 17 and irish/american|`|swrlL30Aaa	you look about 17 to 19 and irish and amazing!!|`|r8dZbh8saa	Looking hot.

TkPFp8vqaa	I think girls want a man whom she can simply be herself. Now, as to my own taste, I've always admired gallantry in a man. I like men to be funny, outgoing, and hardworking...finally, a man that's simply there for you, in all aspects.|`|N8TIPTDfaa	first, i'll admitt it, good looks.     That's how we're first attracted to guys, or else it'll take alot longer for us to like you, since we will have to get to know u and start to like your personality. Understand?     Basically, i've had alot of bad experiences with ex's...(as have many girls)  so i look for a guy who seems like he could be civil if we ever broke up. (not best friends,no... but still somewhat friends)     Also, i hate cheaters. I look for someone who has no past in cheating on their girlfriend. If they have, yes i'll hear them out...but it's a huge turnoff. I look for guys who are honest.     Also, being funny always helps.      A guy who has problems showing emotions to girls can be intriguing at first, but in the end...completely irritating.     Basically,   Just show them your not an a**, and won't hurt them.|`|x6wuVavqaa	Well, this may vary for different people, but I like a guy who is funny, good-looking, kinda popular , (i mean, he cant be a friendless loser )  and atleast a b student.|`|8EEVuprGaa	1 kinda sweet   2 cute  3 humor   4 if they old enough a car   5 if they like me   i like your player card  i love a guy w/ a great sence of humor
pBbNoPAaaa	maybe you're putting the guy up so high that when you finally realize that he is human and has flaws you feel let down. I think you should look at your standards, set them and then see who fits (realistically) into them. No one is perfect and dating in high school is about varitey and seeing what kind of guys you are drawn to. it's more like testing the waters but how can you test it if you move on so quickly that the poor guy doesn't get a chance? The next guy you "idolize" see why you like him so much and then ask yourself if you're being realistic. :] hope i helped! :] btw it's a teenage girl thing haha|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	there's an adrenaline rush that comes from mystery and the chase.   it can be addicting!
xJBJn6dOaa	If you don't normally see her, look her up on myspace or facebook, if you have it. That way it's casual... and you can send a message to see how she is and if she wants to hang out sometime.
RsAhiIuxaa	ah my friends use 2 do that 2 me all the time! right now i dont hang out with them as much tho, because we have so many diffrences we just say hey and its done,   i dont think u should get a boyfriend , unless u want to. but its like ur saying oh well since my friends have boyfridns then i should get 1 2 (lol) just talk them be ur self, and its not like theyll have their boyfriends  4ever, AAND prob they exited they have their boyfriend theyll get over it and everything will get back 2 normal SO UNTILL THEN HOLD ON!!  and if they think u need a boyfriend, its probably because they dont want u 2 feel left out when their talking. maybe u should talk 2 some of ur other friends when their gushing about their boyfriends or chnge the subject =)   and if they arnt the sensative type speak ur mind!     OKAYY the stalker thing CREEPY lol i had 1 back in middle school and after my friends threw pencills him, he never looked at me again ;) but dont do it its mean hahaha    best of luckkk |`|Ch40nAvCaa	I know how you feel, I couldn't get a girlfriend if my life depended on it.|`|1hLX4ZIVaa	who cares about that. What I want you to know is this: I'M STALKING YOU. I AM WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE. I AM WATCHING YOUR EVERY POST, YOUR EVERY QUESTION, EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO ONLINE. BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS, I AM WATCHING YOU. I TOLD YOU I WAS PERSISTANT.|`|4MkI2hAkaa	Seriously, if they're your friends, just tell them "listen guyz, u no i dont have a bf right now, and I'd appreciate it if u could talk about something else when i'm around" just be polite and sincere - your friends should understand.|`|5f4qvGLKaa	From a guy's perspective      Having a boyfriend means nothing if it is only to have something to talk about, even if you kind of like him, but you're still forcing things to make it work (been on the guy's side, not fun)    You said they just got boyfriends, well after about a week or two they will either break up or things will die down and they'll talk about them less    I know my advice prolly sucks, if you could call it advice, but I tried to help what I could|`|KQjBLyU3aa	omg I have a similar issue. First, it's pretty stupid to tell someone "you 'need' a boyfriend". I mean, honestly, you were right to say you didn't need one. Just deal with it for a bit, they're excited they have boyfriends but eventually they'll get over it. If you're not worried about them getting their feelings hurt if they're not overly sensitive, then tell them its getting on your nerves. Best of luck!|`|qsJQiICEaa	you're JUST like me!!! All my best friends have boyfriends and all they ever do is talk about them. It is REALLY annoying. And it'll get to the point where your friends will start choosing their boyfriends over you (been there, done that, it sucks)     But anyway, DO NOT get a boyfriend just to get one. TRUST ME!!!! You have to REALLY like the guy, just wait until the right guy comes along or you will completely regret it. And you are SOO right, you do NOT need a boyfriend. Boyfriends are just "extra" things in life that can make you a little more happier, but if you're happy now, then you don't need one. Don't give into peer pressure. Be happy for your friends that do have boyfriends, you're time will come girlll! good luck     PS: I've had crazy stalkers too haha :)
V61O2fQraa	You are only 16 so there is not much that you need to do anyway but i would just tell him and let know because no matter what you do if your not his type or he just sees you as a friend you could never change his mind , so just let him know even if you have to send him a text or it may be easy over the phone|`|YPZICzNjaa	Well in high school it may be a little hard not to act slutty :-)    Anyway, it is pretty simple for insightful knowledge to show him how u feel.  Firstly I would suggest taking him to the park and talking it over, or going to movies, OR plainly just ask him out so that way it won't make u feel "dirty".  And unless he is taking advantage of u, then he really will truely take in to account your feelings and act accordingly    gl.    -deatgh
UZ2nix6xaa	It's perfectly natural to be somebody else after somebody breaks up with you, after all it is very demoralising.. i've only fought with my gf and i can definately say that's made me want to be someone else.    Really you shouldn't beat yourself up about it, you are who you are and your gf went out with you for a reason - because you were you! Plus in my opinion it's better to have fewer friends who like you for you, not more friends who like you for what you appear to be. Also, fewer friends means that you'll have a stronger relationship with each of them, rather than a not-so-strong relationship with many friends.
x1tEBx2jaa	i think so. its either that, or you have something on ur face.
bVbFAyzjaa	it's never too late to have your first date or first kiss.  just be patient and confident and someone will come along for you :)|`|te2aIm0Maa	It's never too late darling. Your Romeo/Edward will come soon.|`|CpA2oOuLaa	when you've come to the point in your life when you are broadcasting to Yahoo users that you are at least 26 and never been kissed, ... it might be time to give up.  And not just on dating, on everything.|`|u0ipviQsaa	Why does everyone put time tables on everything?  Your lips don't shrivel up and die if they haven't been kissed before you're in your late 20's, early 30s.    There's not an expiration date.  You very well may be single at 26 but so what?  Keep living your life and your time will come.  It's never "too late"
lQjWLffmaa	well that's kinda confusing but i think he is talking about you because you did kiss another guy and it just hurt him since he's known you for so long he love's you and cant forget u|`|MPnhrXmoaa	you dumb people and posting your relationship problems... why do u waste your time posting your stupid love issues on here.. FYI this is the internet... NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW YOUR PERSONAL BUSINESS... if u want my advice, it will be to GET OVER IT!!|`|DQNHWtquaa	I guess the only thing I would recommend if for you to ask him..The only way to really know is to ask..have you tried to contact him at all? Maybe you should..hope this helps..|`|jJ8lxzEPaa	u because it sounds like he liked u the most
x0KszFPMaa	you get into a relationship to find your future spouse, and if you're not ready to find a spouse...don't date.|`|3secB3Smaa	The point is not the relationship,it is the person. people need to be mature enough to handle a relationship. That is the POINT.  You are not mature enough yet,that's why you have your point of view.
f512X3itaa	just talk to her and ask her even with friends around her and if she says no then the embrassment will only be for that day then you will feel good and go after a different girl get married and have kids.
289e5c6fc572ccc4dbd7e03a68af8700aa	why would you give me your number!?!? IM CALLING IT!      and i dont get this question!
kDgHDB8saa	just tell him how you feel  you give him a lot, and he should give you something in return  let him know that it seems like he doesnt care about you, or that it seems like hes using you since hes not giving you anything in return...or just tell him, that if he doesnt then you wont, that should motivate him  it seems like hes attracted to you tho, he might just be uncomfortable with doing that. he might have never done it before, so just give him time.|`|5TmGu6LAaa	He could just be holding back and is waiting for a special moment or he's controlling himself.    Its pretty much your call|`|3YpVVRWpaa	hes not that into you sweetie  hes only for youe sex just let him go you have a better life look for a partner who really loves you for who you are not what you do on the bed hes *** hole|`|YbHKiRutaa	He is scared probably his first time  maybe he thinks you have high expectations  of him or something  give him time  and talk to him!!

ZPHB8TeAaa	well first of all do you really like and trust this guy enough to sleep in the same bed with him? well if the answer is yes then things arent gettting that complicated. But, you should find out first if he is willing to move forward and start a relationship with you.
UnBCo7lOaa	im sorry, that's sounds like a horrible situation. im 14... but i'll se what i can do to help :)     i understand that it's hard to trust new people, but really, what you have to do is just be brave! throw yourself out there! find some people and start growing upon them, get to know them, trust them, have some girl time! He can't be the only person in your life that you know and trust. i sort of feel the same way about this guy i know, so im sort of being a hypocrite, i guess i'll have to try to follow my own advice as well :) i really hope that helped, and good luck! =D
fvANNGmFaa	Okay, before you start worrying about if she likes you more than friends, remember, you need to get to the friends first  Or else it usually gets really awkward...  Anyway, when I like a guy I usually show off in front of them, talk to them as much as possible, sit next to him in class, turn red and look down when I see him in the hallway, ask them for homework or help with classwork, IM them a lot  This can always change depending on the girl. If she's shy she could get really quiet in front of you and avoid conversations to not embaress herself.|`|165f72404d5b6cbc8f621fb7f48ae504aa	Experts on human mating state that women may display the following signals when they are interested in you:    1.

Make some light conversation and see how she responds.|`|1pXMTOkaaa	Spend some more time around her desk to let her know that you're interested. Maybe talk to her, flirt a little, smile at her, ask her out to a small lunch?|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Friend, there are many possibilities here without me knowing the full story or details here. Here are some of the possible scenarios:    1. She's interested but shy. Guy, you have to actually approach her. Women want a man who is assertive and confident. You can't just wait for her to fall in your lap, literally nor figuratively. On the inside, she may be screaming, "Come and talk to me already!"    2. She is a fake. Some women (I said "some", girls - don't get mad at me) like to fake interest just to see if you will ask them out. It's not necessarily just to shoot you down. For these types, it's usually some form of self-affirmation (of course, when MEN do it, we're playing a "head game").     3. She may be too structured and does not wish to date someone from her workplace. Think about it. She already knows what you do for a living. She already has a general idea of how much you earn. And most importantly, she probably already knows a little too much of your personality and history. Working together does that. If that is the case, where is the mystery? Where is the challenge? It's vacationing in Fiji and is nowhere to be found.    How do we resolve these three possibilities, you ask? Read on:    For  1, go talk to her for no more than five minutes. At the end of the five minutes, ask for the phone number. If you get it, she MIGHT not  2. If she gives you any kind of excuse, she's not interested.     If she IS  2, she may still give you the number. She may even go out with you...once or twice. It would depend on what level of acceptance she is seeking. Regardless, it is important to remember that even if she is seeking your acceptance, it does NOT necessarily mean that she is interested in you. Bottom-line her actions. It is not important WHAT she says nor HOW she says it. You have to watch her body language and how she "treats" you. Does she break dates? Does she touch your arm when you talk? Most importantly, the phone is only for a five-minute conversation to ask her on a date. If you get the voice mail or answering machine, you NEVER leave a message. That leaves too much room for you to say something stupid.    If she is  3, she is clearly not the type you want to date. Forget about it and move on to someone else.    Good luck, my friend!
N8TIPTDfaa	All guys are into different things.     Some like girls curvy,  some like them athletic,     typically, they seem to like girls with large boobs, small waist, medium/small hips.     However, don't be worried...i know guys who like skinny girls because they're "tiny and cute"      Hey, maybe those girls are just jealous of you? :)  Your age is when some girls start dieting, and trying to be very skinny.  I know that i'm jealous of some of my friends who can eat whatever they want and not gain a pound.     Don't worry about it, and long as you eat healthy, i'm sure  you look fine :)
InmJrzVxaa	Don't spend too much time being creative or cute.  That could make things more complicated than they need to be.    Just go up to him and ask him, and be yourself.  Trust me, it may be fun or whatever to do the cute/creative thing, but this will work.  And its a lot less stressful on your part.
rDnQ6MNYaa	Lots of young guys think there is some sort value in taking a woman's virginity.  Older guys, who know better, know that non-virgins are 1 million times better.  Who wants to have sex with someone who is so clueless that they are not even into it.      There is a reason why women prefer guys who are non-virgins.  The virgin guys are not that good and women prefer quality.      Men sometimes are just to immature to realize that.|`|FZMVjKweaa	i prefer a virgin bcuz they are "pure"lol but yeah it means no 1 else had it yet and i would be the first understand?|`|mXaYRe9Oaa	virgins, cause i dont mind if i have it show them how to have sex, but i would be the their first.|`|1MxAJtjqaa	Personally, I wouldn't mind either, but I think it would be awkward to take a girl's virginity.  Sure, they are "pure" and "untouched" and a lot of dudes find that attractive, but a girl losing her virginity is gonna be something she'll remember for the rest of her life and I'd feel too much pressure just thinking about that, but if it came down to it, then yeah, i'll make it special for her.... Sorry for rambling, well anyway I prefer both : ) I hope that answers your question : )
AA11595860	He's really going to have to like you to go against his parents...  I know a lot of Indians, and they really want their kids to marry within...    Be careful getting into this one unless your absolutely sure you love him.   It may not be easy for you or him. Try being friends first and play it by ear. You'll know what his intentions are in time. Don't worry your pretty head about it now. GL!|`|cqhMFAssaa	I think he likes you, but he's not asking you out becuase his parents won't let him date or something,becuase that might be against his religious beliefs....
AA12108398	she'll know. no girl takes a guy asking her out as just friends first. but if this girl does then make it obvious.    need future help? frighteningtruth.webs.com/    happy to help:)|`|HwujORd2aa	Ask her if you can take her out on Saturday night.  If you sound like you're asking for a date, she should get the point.  Make sure you look nice and that you have money to pay for the actual date.  It's not a date if you ask her out and she has to pay her half!  :-)
OtKMSMn5aa	OK, I'm 39 and it's been a while since I dated.  (Been married for 14 years)   But I have some advice, not on how to get a guy, but on what to do once you have him hooked.    First, decide now, how far you are willing to go in a relationship.  At 13, you should most likely be looking for guys who will take you out to the movies, for a burger, or to the mall, things like that.  Let him know up front what you are looking for in a relationhsip and just how far you are looking to go in that relationship.  If you don't want to be kissed, let him know.  If you are comfortable holding hands, let him know.  Be open and communicate with him.  That is the best way to get the relatioship started right.  Second.  Double Date.  Yes, I did say Double Date.  Don't go to places where the two of you will be alone.  This is important because it will tell you whether or not the guy is interested in getting to know you or just getting you into bed.  (Yes, there are both kinds out there and you don't want to get hurt this early in life).  Double dates really give you the opportunity to get to know the guy.  Third, make time for him to meet your folks.  Invite him to your house for dinner.  Your parents will want to know that their daughter is safe with the guy and what he is like.  Lastly, Watch out for the friendships.  I married one of my "just friends" from school.  Actually, these make the best potential mates.  If you have a guy in your circle of friends, you might consider whether he could make a good boyfriend.    Above all, just be yourself.  Most guys don't want a girl "pursuing" them.  They will let you know if they are interested.      Good luck and have fun in school.  Concentrate on your studies because that is most important.
k5wqvI42aa	oh haha that kinda happened to me. if a girl gets too excited and shows you too much attention in person, she'll feel like an idiot and try to compensate by ignoring you later. ive totally done that before lol. so don't worry its probably nothing you did, just give her some time to get over herself and things will be fine. good luck ?|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	Call her!! The only way you are going to know is by calling and see her reaction. I feel for you guys with the burden of making the first move, but if you really like a girl she should be worth the chance of rejection.    Good Luck!!|`|Rc5wpzSiaa	online if she doesn't reply ususally ppl leave their computer on. well talk to her in real life and start hanging out|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Well mabye you should just call and ask her whats up it'll never hurt a girls feelings if ya do that.
cPgOxcS7aa	I think you should tell him how you feel about him.  He may feel the same about way about you.|`|Wo6K4vPraa	Sounds like he's interested in you too, talk to him and play it by ear
tC0bxF2daa	Doesn't very much matter what your wearing, as long as it complements your body type. I think the two best things would be stripping down to your bra/panties one piece at a time, and slowly/ gently caressing your body as you do so. (Works best if you keep your knickers on, makes the guy use his mind / imagination which makes it more exciting.)    Or you could do the evil thing, and just go wow it's hot in here, and take off a sweater to reveal a low cut shirt and play innocent..|`|1r05fktRaa	ware night|`|pQGUPITeaa	I can't imagine it's that difficult.|`|X1gOkyNqaa	dress up in a sexy dress and strip for him|`|ctjz1Btiaa	Run in circles and try to run in a straight line. Just watch out for windows.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Think about showing your breast. If want to.... holla at me.
EtLDmuhqaa	  ?wow...this is really  confusing......  isnt going out, like  meeting each other?  idk...just treat her ?   really nice.   =]|`|tAQOcfA8aa	try once more to meet up, if that goes awry, than dont talk to her anymore|`|FaNrYZoTaa	she wants to be bf and gf before you meet?    uhh no? ha just be like "lets meet first and see how things go..."
PEYYcGpuaa	Take her on a romantic picnic, I"m pretty sure she will love it.... but you might wanna check how the weather is going to be. It would really suck if it starts raining.... well kissing in the rain is really romantic to.
056be7bee715d5419f3c8135a45b8dd1aa	Oh, I wish some girl was wondering this about me. He's a lucky guy to have someone thinking about him like that, that's one more then I have. Just start small talking. Just be nice and considerate. Don't try to come on all that much. Then after a while just ask him out. Tell him to think about it for a while or to sleep on it. And if you were a nice person to him, then chances are he will like you. Gosh, what a lucky dude.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Ask him to tutor you.|`|OufyDBWRaa	sit next to him in spanish make sure that he knows that u are doing not so well but don't over exaggerate. when the teacher gives u an assignment ask him if he can help u with it. do this a lot and when u get partner work work with him         chances are that this works  in other words try to get noticed   got luck or screw him  :)|`|40qTdKuPaa	Since your not good at spanish and he is, ask him to help you with it! That's a good way to start. and talking only about spanish will turn into talking about things you guys like to talk about and maybe a relationship. Hope this helps.|`|gILNCMiqaa	ask him out talking  in spanish or like write it or something|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Since your not that good at spanish, ask for his help. You know, something along the lines like "Hey, your good at spanish right? Can you help me?" Then, ask about his name, and blah blah, get to know him.|`|iAhCtXFIaa	be like hey do you have any paper or a pencil i can borrow lol|`|wQcYAmY5aa	hey can you help me with my spanish please?|`|G4wEL4qoaa	Ask for him help on a worksheet or homework, even if you know how to do it or something.  Or make a passing comment about how the teacher sucks or something.|`|uEDDlofhaa	Talk about the class in general, how he likes it or if your assigned something try saying "hey uhm, i don't really understnad this could u help" and go fromt here :)|`|zCS9KpIWaa	sports, what he thinks of his teachers, music, really anything. Just dont bring up Twilight.    Please Answer Mine http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|1I3QbSrgaa	Do you have any clue of if he notices you?  There's always facebook but that would make it awkward when you finally talk in person. I say you make yourself noticeable and at all costs make him talk to you. So you look like the bigger figure and will give you confidence and not be a dunce when he tries to make conversation with you. And just remember, friends have friends that know cute people in spanish class.  so ask around;]
SCXkBWk6aa	stuff her, you don't date a girl to be friends with her friends.    get over  it bro|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well maybe you should talk to your girlfriend about the situation and about how you are feelings.|`|WB8uBODtaa	Kill her. You can't let obstacles get in your way to the major prize.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	maybe you did/said something. Go back and see what you did. she cant just ***** at you like that for no reason. If you really didnt do anything and she keeps acting like that, breakup with her. she's not worth it, and I certainly know I wouldnt want to be in a relationship like that.|`|fWclxi9Baa	maybe she doesnt like you|`|8O4ttgGMaa	maybe. she probably doesnt like you because youre making her best friend spend less time with her. whatever  just be nice and ignore her|`|xgJbxZgfaa	maybe b/c she likes u. forget her that's dumb and immature
AA11618874	First, don't be offended and it is not your fault. It isn't his fault either. if it's his first time he might have gotten overly anxious or nervous or both. it sounds like it's a psychological problem. Next time tell him to lay back and relax. Remind him that he has nothing to worry about since it's new to you too and you are impressed with his member regardless of weather you really are or not. You have to relax him and loosen him up a bit. act like you are insecure about your breast size to make him feel like he's not alone.   And you both were drinking? Any guy should know that alcohol consumption damages the ability to achieve and maintain an erection. Sure one or two beers should be fine, but the more liquer consumed, the more difficult it will be to get it hard.     Then while he's laying back seductively remove his clothes and pleasure his... you know. perform some foreplay fellatio just for a minute. it should stiffen him up like the meat thermometer in a Thanksgiving turkey. Then once he's hard, lube him AND you up and sit on his lap using him for a support beam if you catch my drift. While you're on top you will be the one in control and so you will be able to use his thingy like your own personal sex toy to get yourself off. Then get into doggy style position and let him do his own thing.     The condom might be uncomfortable for... ..... ... "IT". The condom should fit snug enough so it doesn't slide like a damn piston shaft, but loose enough so blood can flow easily through it. And condoms take away a percent of the pleasure for men. And whatever you do, don't ever sigh like as though you're bored or tired of trying to have sex. Never let him try to seduce you into anal sex as it will hurt the 1st time at least and may cause some medical problems with the colon or the poopshoot and could cause rectal bleeding. He may not be after anal play this early into the game but I'm sure he'll become curious of that vile stuff soon enough.    Have fun and ALWAYS practice safe sex for f**k sake!
8PsmDQyMaa	hmm. i'd be careful with this onee.  but if you do makeout with him dont worry.  the good thing is that he is expierenced so he will do most of the work.  just kiss like you normally would but hold it for a few seconds  and follow his lead. when he starts to open his mouth a lil, open yours  then when bothe your mouths are open he will push his tounge against yours and you just do the same thing. and you guys just do that for a while. haha good luck, have fun. dont worry making out is one of those things that comes naturally:]|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Using you. Duh. Girls are stupid. If a guy sincerely likes you he won't care about any of that. But if you want to be one of his sluts just go in the room or whatever and just play with his lips and suck on them, start kissing his kneck, take off your shirt, and then sooner or later you will be on your back with your legs spread. 9 Months later your having a baby all because you thought a guy liked you.|`|7KGXRu19aa	Well first of all practice makes perfect.  But if he has made out with tonz of girls then he might not like you in the way you want him to.  Makin out should come naturally
vf56ahxsaa	Maybe, and maybe not. You do have to be a bit careful sometimes though, sometimes boys do this just to have fun or even make fun of you. You have to check his love history though, and try ask your friends or his classmates about his attitude and stuff. This will help you in knowing him. But, if you do know this boy really well then, just try asking him out for a date or just ask him if he likes you more than his girlfriend or not. i'm not quiet sure what kind of person you are, and what your life is like, so, im just saying what i know. Good luck though in getting him :)|`|SsvwdhsPaa	sounds like nothing but drama to me.|`|MuSYw7m3aa	well first you he should dump his gf if he likes you   so talk to him about it and see what he says  then you should kno if he likes you|`|AA12108398	he probably does. but DO NOT kiss him, touch him, or anything with him until you know he is single. you do not want to be a home wrecker!    anything else please visit my website frighteningtruth.webs.com/    happy to help:)

And dont force a girl to do something she doesnt want on the other hand it takes two. but you could always apolagize and come clean to the other boy.|`|KJpFr9lKaa	forget itt , its done with so who gives a crap.  just leave her alone and leave him alone too, move on.|`|GjeFdpfbaa	I would hope she wouldn't want to date you anyhow. The quality of a girlfriend isn't based on how well she is rated at sex. Besides, why should she trust you? You seem to be just fine having sex with anyone.
4m9Hewq1aa	If you're chatting with her online send her the link for Jason Mraz's song "If It Kills Me". It's perfect for this situation and that would be a pretty romantic gesture, plus it's someone else saying your feelings for you! This will break the ice, then you can tell her in your own words how you feel. Best of luck to you! -Alice|`|RQFmnpSaaa	dog im in da same boat wit ya, im gonna tell mine next wk. my motto u will never know till you try.
7ZHe4Jzkaa	i say you should go  if he wants you to    and if your ready i guess?  i dont think he would do to much with you  your first time at his house
ZRRvnYMsaa	honestly what i would do is to not tell my friend and then say no to him do you like him tho if you do tell him and then tell her what you did and y|`|ogydNuCzaa	you should listen your heart says

So, you are definitely not ugly. Don't let yourself get carried away with self criticism because you are not ugly, by any stretch of the imagination.|`|1117d18f8d71cf8ea1aa8a2c83b3cb4daa	awww.. you really are a little cutie, i wish i was 14 ;) lol|`|rZuSN2kTaa	You look okay.

You look cute for your age!    =]|`|E2XbFVBQaa	When u say the pics r kinda old do u mean they are 4 years old or what? U look like u r 10 or 11 not 14.

U kinda remind me of the actor from the notebook!|`|o0vIaWx7aa	i'm 13 and i thimk you're really cute i love your blonde hair
cYf5IacRaa	I am so sorry, that's really tough. I perform and I know how hard singing in front of a crowd can be and I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be in those circumstances. Honestly, I don't really think there's much you can do besides try your best to ignore him unless you guys are in a scene together and have to interact. Or, if you wanted to, you could try being friends. I understand that can be really difficult, especially since you're still interested in him, but it might be easier than things staying awkward. Anyway, good luck and I hope everything works out for you! :)|`|dHBUmRCMaa	I agree with redrabbit, you were played. You act as if you two had a relationship. "Our song" is for couples, and you two never were.     If he wanted you, he would be with you instead of his girlfriend. Realize that you were only there to flirt with and make him feel good about himself.     Your friends are listening, they are just tired. They have heard what you have had to say, let you cry about it, and now are tired of hearing the same thing over and over and over and over again. They have tried to tell you that he isn't worth it and that you are not going to be with him, but you refuse to hear them.    But, don't listen to me, redrabbit, your friends and risk loosing your spot or getting kicked out of the play because you are too distracted to do what you are supposed to do, possibly loose your friends because they are tired of you not listening to them when they are trying to help you.    What you should be doing is going "You know what? I can do better. He is nothing. He had his chance and he blew it. I will find someone better and if he ever comes to his senses, well too bad."    Get over him. He isn't worth loosing yourself.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You two can't have a song because you were never dating. He has a girlfriend, and yes, your friends are right, you need to get over him. You can't have him, so move on. There are MANY guys out there.    You can't even see that he played you. If he wanted you, he would be with you and not his girlfriend. You were just there. Wake up. He used you. You act as if you two dated and you didn't.|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	Just hangout with your real friends and stay away from him. Also, stop being jealous of his girlfriend.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	These feelings will persist and keep you from noticing the next cute guy that wants to meet and hang out with you.      Once you get a new guy, and you are really into him, these feelings will disappear.    So, go to the rehersal and look for that next guy, and ignore the old trash.  Throw it out !
7yrdcqY1aa	just invite more girls than guys :)|`|dpLONMkDaa	That might make the guys a little mad... why don't you just invite less guys and more girls?    =]
K5IOSGXAaa	It wouldn't hurt to ask. But don't be surprised if the answer is no. Many businesses can't/won't hire minors because of their insurance regulations.|`|jGgRF3Yjaa	i don't think they will hire u.. u just 14..

4JGTC2MHaa	Comfort is key. If you don't reveal your fetish at the right time, you'll come across as a pervert. It took me a long time to tell my partner that I like to be *ahem* erotically asphyxiated. We had to build trust, and sometimes that can take a while. I know it sounds cliche, but the best thing you can do is get to know each other and build trust.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	This is something that you just have to get to a point with someone where you can both openly discuss your fetishes. Try and get on the subject of sex with her, then just ask what some of her fetishes are. Im sure that once she has told you she will ask you the same question. BAM, before you know it she'll be soaking wet laying on a desk waiting for you. Most woman are pretty open with it, its just a matter of getting to that comfort level with them first and slowly opening the door.|`|KVCkcMokaa	Took me about 5 -6 months to really get it out in the open, and she deosnt mind as she is very open minded and accepts everything about me....also depends on, when you comfortable in the relationship, maybe ask her if she has any? also, if you are at a mature level with each other...some other factors...but yeah 5 - 6 months for us (she is 26 i am 28)..and she loves making me happy with these fetishes...good luck dude!

6J8sHGRIaa	She needs to be helped immediately.|`|DAeuUBqnaa	woah..  er...well...she sounds like a ***** just because she pretends a lot.  but it doensn't necessary mean that she is one. Usually, girls that are bitches, are spoiled brats who think highly of themselves. They do whatever they want, control others, and think they are the queen and etc.   if she got you into trouble than yes she would be considered as a *****
GqhtePhgaa	He's an ex for a reason and from what you say it's likely because he used you and probably didn't respect you.  So he says he can't be friends.  I could never be friends with someone I was intimate with.    My suggestion is that if he can't be friends, it's time to say goodbye.  Regardless of what your heart is telling you, you know that going back is going to be disastrous.  You may love him but you know he's not the right guy for you or you'd not be asking what to do here.    So move on and say goodbye.  Then neither of you will have to worry about those old memories.    Good luck!
AA11262612	get a grip, dude.  talk to her.|`|AA11852420	Your question kinda confuses me.

Girls play games all the time. Mind games. If she shows signs she likes you and then you return the signs she will distance herself from you to see how far you will go to chase her. That way she knows how long it will take for you to give in to things she wants but you dont. When she looked away from you when giving you her MSN info it could be nothing but it also could be a bit of shyness she has too. But look at it this way. She DID give you her info. And that is a good thing because people find it easier to talk personal things on the computer to each other then in person........Good luck

Creo que a diferencia tuya, pienso que esa alma gemela puede tener muchas diferencias superficiales (gustos, preferencias, ideas, etc) pero que en esencia te hacen sentir que encontraste tu otra parte suelta en este mundo.  Es ese ser que como dijiste sentis que la conoces desde siempre, que queres crecer con ella, que todo esta en calma porque encontraste lo que buscabas, y eso tranquiliza tu alma.

It kind of just goes in one ear and out the other at this point. I've also told him about it and told him that him being like that makes me not want to be with him.

Mid Life Crisis  2. Stress / Worry  3. Having an Affair  4. All the above    Anyone of them, can lead into another, however, it is vitally important that you don't ignore it, as men in particular cope with pressure differently from women.     The root problem  of  many relationships stems from losing your "Joy" without it your relationship is doomed. You BOTH must first recognize and then BOTH work on restoring it.

Don't ignore that girl because it would hurt her feelings, just go for it.  Do not be a loner or isolationist because you would regret it in the end.

jYMlAN4Paa	You can buy sex, companionship, a trophy wife/husband who has no feelings for you and a person to pretend they love you for a few hours for money. But that's it. Love and money have nothing to do with each other.|`|5FCiKNaGaa	no, well not real love    lol i guess you could buy a dog, but still if you where mean to him/her they wouldnt love you|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Real love can't be bought. If you've "bought" someone's affections with money, chances are they are false and will leave you when the money runs out or the gifts stop coming. If you've allowed someone else to buy your affections with money that makes you a gold-digger.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	no|`|1ZG6ZmxKaa	Nope! but u can buy sex|`|3AjAswkWaa	yes...hire a high class escort..|`|t4BpFdmdaa	Yeah, ugly old rich men always do that.

Just tell her already didn't all this start in September?!!! Just be bold, and assertive and tell her already.!|`|o2J1RbnVaa	Okay so. Dont act like you really like her. And never again ask questions like: How do you feel about me? We, girls hate that even if we like a guy.   She might like you but as long and you gays have different friends she might be afraid to admit that she does like you.  Change something in yourself, your hair, your style. But make sure that it is gonna look good. And when you talk to her be funny but do not show interest, be like you do not car and just talk like you do to your regular girl friends...  Something is going to change) GOOD LUCK!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	youre doing a good job..  kepp up what youre doing...  something will happen eventually..|`|IRAtmZhTaa	ask her out  duh!  she seems to like u man|`|4PKpQVxEaa	Just keep talking to her, hon. If you want to give out signals that you like her, put your arm around her when you're hanging out with a group of people and smile at her. Girls do like it when guys act flirty and give hugs (hugs are nice, definitely do that.)     Maybe you should try and hang out with her after school. Invite her over the house with a couple other people and hang out.     If you have the courage to, maybe even ask her on a date. Just tell her its casual and after that gradually make it seem that you're into her.    I bet sooner or later she'll get the idea ^___^|`|gV9KgNctaa	hmm usually girls are weird and want alot of guys to like them but act as if though they dont notice or care  i think she might like you since she writes in ur note book and akward moments usually happenen when people are nervous so maybe she likes you     i think you write notes in class with her and ask her questions and stuff like what was ur fiirst impresssion of me or stuff lke that

La reponse est simple, parceque c'est la beaut qui nous valorise, autrement et moins joliment dit, ca booste notre ego d'etre entour des belles choses, c'est comme un mirroir qui reflete nos images. Alors souvent ces images doivent nous correspondre.|`|9653bf7a0720934ef4636130dd504094aa	Bien sur personne n'est insensible  la beaut, mais il faut que le reste suive, si derrire il y a une cervelle d'oiseau, pour ma part la beaut n'est pas le premier de mes critres, le charme dgag, le charisme, sont beaucoup plus important.|`|7b482b8c6412aa70905de054d8209400aa	Bien sur une fille bien foutu et le rve de tout mec, mais moi en ce qui me concerne , je prfre un peu plus les filles mal "foutu" car elles au moins se donnent en amour !!!!!|`|5af38dfa09984e3cf447e33980bc9e53aa	parce qu'ils veulent copuler.....a dpart dans l'espce animal la copulation tant f pour procrer les males ont attirs par les femelles ki ont des physique prouvant la fertilit....les hommes ont des males mais des males politiques....mais sinon un garcons peut bien aimer(ya pas de variance de ce mot en francais) une filles pas joli mais sortira pas avec|`|026f50267552444d3b674b4f43fceb66aa	?a c'est le cot patrimoine gntique qu'on veut transmettre  nos enfants...  pour le reste on n'aime pas que les filles jolie, y en a des pas trs jolies mais qui sont plus aimables que des bombes et dont qu'on est bien plus heureux avec...  il y a des limites comme mme et ?a vaut aussi bien pour les filles comme pour les gar?ons|`|c400093d9f7939ec0968bb32775c5de9aa	Parce que les filles aiment les beaux mecs !|`|deb55a34b9fd0ec5bbc2b02c0d122184aa	parceque|`|b1affa2a4ec6d777723c97f5a0f7b808aa	c pour le respect dans la rue|`|0ad80ef9d01089e4ed9a0331f5008cf6aa	parcequ'ils ont du go?t -->2pts merci|`|ebc7d3b7695d2a310a5e2929c37c10fcaa	et pourquoi pas. tu cannais une chose plus belle que la beaut?|`|3d6e25431a9650a929e1c82756b45addaa	je ne suis pas joli pourtant  les mecs m'aiment|`|c6f22611320c7bbb7b92a9b47bd76841aa	La Nature pousse les hommes  choisir une compagne qui :  - semble saine et sans dfaut pour que les enfants soient parfaits  - a de larges hanches (pour viter les problmes d'accouchement) et de gros seins (bon allaitement du bb)  - soit fine de taille (pour bien distinguer les hanches et aussi parce que la finesse est synonyme de jeunesse et donc de fertilit. En vieillissant les femmes prennent naturellement du poids)    Tout ceci reste valable, mais c'est devenu inconscient !  Reste que la Nature est une jungle dans laquelle seuls les meilleurs peuvent subsister (suppression automatique des individus les moins performants pour amliorer la race)... Et donc les physiques les plus proches de la perfection gntique sont les plus recherchs.    Donc, les hommes sont simplement "tlguids" par cet instinct.|`|815a8027d3d9e090f9af5285a2f8d29baa	parceque ?a les rassure quand  leur physique et  leur mental, ils se sentent gratifis quoi! ils sont tellement ......|`|097b16a943cac95e39bdb469ff8007caaa	C'est normal, non?

S'il refuse, ne vous rendez pas complice de cet enlvement et prenez vos responsabilits, c'est peut-tre ce qu'attend votre fils. Bon courage.|`|f30a7d9d0d442f55246b1586f77b24f5aa	Ca dpend pourquoi il l'a fait. S'il a enlev quelqu'un et qu'il le torture et le viole chaque jour, c'est clair qu'il faut dnoncer.  S'il a enlev quelqu'un qui se faisait violer et torturer chaque jour l o il se trouvait avant, alors faut pas dnoncer...  Malheureusement, la ralit est rarement aussi simple.  Mets toi  la place de l'enlev, de ton fils, de la personne  qui on a enlev quelqu'un, de la morale et de la justice : et l tu agis.  Mon avis perso (qui ne vaut rien car je ne vis pas la situation): c'est ton r?le de parent de venir en aide  ton fils quand il sort de la lgalit , il doit tre dans une situation qui le fait beaucoup souffrir. Je pense que tu dois le dnoncer aprs avoir essay de lui faire entendre raison.

cde31afe8bf073dcbd9d6af708f0c7b6aa	Le nom ? zodiaque ? vient du mot grec zodiakos [kyklos], "cercle de petits animaux", de zodiaion, diminutif de zoon: "animal". Ce nom vient de ce que toutes les constellations du Zodiaque (sauf la Balance, anciennement partie du Scorpion) figurent des cratures vivantes.    Le plus souvent, le grand public a entendu parler des signes du zodiaque dans un contexte astrologique et non astronomique.|`|86080ffa83e1f9086a74ce29e5efeaf8aa	Pas tous ... Une balance c'est un animal ? peut tre, remarque, je ne m'y connais pas beaucoup ...

qNNcJ2B6aa	well trust me, guys are shy too,     the worst thing u can do is not talk because they will think that u dont like em, and thats not good..............    i hope that helped :)  let me know if u improve :D|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	get buzzed when u know ur gonna see a guy, that should do it|`|ubj2hZWZaa	They are people just like you.  just talk to one of them that like the same stuff you do.  and as said before ;be yourself at all times|`|AFkmdu92aa	be yourself!|`|73e3f871852c0aa4be6e14a32580488faa	seriously, call a public place like a car dealer ship and just talk to them. It works better if you ask them random questions about your car, like tire size, horsepower.. so on.   good luck|`|8O4ttgGMaa	its hard. but I always start with a disguised compliment. if they're wearing a band tee or something, and you know the band, comment on it. tell him you like his shirt. then he will start talking. just be yourself and relax. dont make stuff up. and remember, boys are dumb! so they think girls are awesome if they give them the time of day. so go for it!|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	It's true, they may not like you, may even tell you to get lost or try to ignore you, or they may date you or kiss you a couple times and then tell you to get lost or try to ignore you. The secret is to play the game and not take it personally, never assume one person's opinion of you reflects the opinions of anyone else nor everyone else. Every person is desperately trying to find some peace in life, and one of the ways they do this is by forming relationships with people they hope to be comfortable and compatible with, and excited by. And this desperation leads people to judge each other on appearance primarily and to be extremely picky about everything else, resulting in rejections and breakups being much more common than long term relationships.|`|ac0rRBHCaa	Stop caring hang with more guys maybe ugly guys get used to dudes|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Be yourself if they know you as someone different they are gonna like you for being that someone else but if you act calm and casual they will like you for who you are.Good Luck!!!! |`|NW39CoLKaa	Get over it, seriously.    They are just other people. They really don't deserver to have someone shy over them.     Whenever you see another guy you like, make sure you know that they are just another fish in the sea.|`|briRpzL1aa	Talk to more of them ... Meaning, you are treating them like they are something special.   The fact is that they are just like you with the same feelings and insecurity issues...      Also, one thing you will find is that guys are much more laid back than girls are.  Meaning, many women like talking to guys allot more than to their girlfriends.    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|DrnyKfXBaa	join clubs and such.    But try to start up conversations! just say "hi, whats up?" and go from there.  It may be scary, but defiantly worth it.|`|2jkZD3e5aa	act like theyre friends or something. they're as intimidated as you are.|`|krkpHSOhaa	Be confident don't really worry about what they think.  They like when they see a girl that's out going.|`|XksFLLiGaa	go for it, not it.. but just do whatever You can to be more sociable, do it|`|0XWVUMCAaa	hunny you tell me|`|05a513515a5bd61c8c12dee5a758e126aa	be yourself, if they don't like you they don't like you. oh well,|`|Km74BXFjaa	Just find a guy friend you that you're already comfortable around and go with him around guys. It'll be a lot easier having him there. He's nothing to compete with (like if you brought a girl).|`|L4eEuaanaa	If you have any friends who are guys, just practice talking to them and maybe hang out with their 'guy friends'.  Just don't worry about gender!  They're just another person, not someone who have to fall in love with you|`|625fGlBmaa	Maybe just say "Hi, how you guys doing?"     Or, if there into sports, you could say something like "How about those Steelers? I hope they win the Super Bowl". Just to start conversation. (That's just an example that came to mind)|`|HfF4EAAhaa	Force yourself to start up conversations. It really does help. ^^ Pick easy topics, like, "do you listen to ____ music" or "watch______". The more you talk to them, the better you get.|`|wkat6Iyjaa	Get a few guy friends that you can talk 2 lyke a guy u have alot in common with but arent really attacted 2 him this way you wount be to nervous to talk 2 him|`|iEVwHmchaa	naked women dont deserve answers!!|`|Aj66QoG4aa	Well, you cant worry about whether they like you or not. You have to just be your self and you will slowly get more comfortable as time passes. Its not one of those things that will happen over night. You just have to be patient. Just loosen up, and talk about sports, or there day, or something to keep conversation up.|`|Zn3tdsb0aa	Be yourself doesn't help much does it?  :P  Ok, well, sorry, but BE YOURSELF!!!  :D|`|8sMJ4qjsaa	o i used to be just like you. but i got the trick.  be fun around them. show your character. mine is funny, very energetic, friendly, and talkative. smile occasionally. when your around them. try to befriend them! good luck! hope i helped!
AA11728166	umm its her choice nottt urss soo i think maybe u should go for the girls who lik dickss :)|`|3secB3Smaa	You realize she has sexual identity problems and advise her to get counseling . You try to date a girl is more secure and more mature .
jMffH1kzaa	Well yeah but in a different way than you. When I was in fifth grade, there was this guy who was dared to sexually abuse me (in a harmless, childish way) and then this other kid started to comfort me and then wanted to go make out. I went along with it, well because I though it was cool and fun to have a boyfriend. Now I'm in 7th grade, and I don't even think that I am mature enough to go out with someone because I really like then and not because everyone else is dating and I think its cool.  xoxoxo  jackie|`|sEZXNychaa	????  wtf is the question???|`|EvvWL0PSaa	huh?|`|A6ej3lQWaa	noo

a443587c876201ac62c5f788434cd85aaa	Tout est dans l'attitude... c'est certain que quelques fois, tu peux tre malchanceuse et que plusieurs choses moches t'arrivent d'un coup... mais ce qui est important, c'est d'analyser toutes ces choses et d'en tirer le meilleur partie. Vois le bon c?t des choses... ce n'est pas toujours vident, mais il y a toujours quelque chose de positif dans chaques situations.  Il ne faut pas oublier que tout ce qui nous arrive dans la vie, est l pour nous faire voluer.   Aussi, si tu es vraiment triste une journe et qu'il n'y a rien  faire, j'ai un bon conseil: coute ta musique prfr et chante!  ?a dfoule.    P-S: Ce n'est pas en se rptant constamment que l'on est malheureux que l'on obtiendra le bonheur... bien au contraire. Rien de pire que l'appitoiement, ?a amplifie les situations banales en catastrophes.|`|37bb7462eb87d1b2f84efc242985789baa	tu as des ondes ngatives pourquoi tu positives pas tu pars perdant(e) alors c cuit|`|86ae49bb6bf2bc50280827b25047224baa	si tu es aussi fataliste c'est s?r que ?a ne t'arrivera pas!!!!

MAIS si tu penses que ca ne marchera pas, ce ne marchera pas.... il faut avoir une attitude positive si tu veux attirer le succes...    ;o)|`|cf7106c773ed794084c874a76e3c4f91aa	C'est par ce que les autres, au lieu de se lamenter et de se comparer pour mieux se lamenter..., vivent leur bonheur, ils apprcient ce qu'ils ont sans regarder ce que l'autre a.  Mon conseil, regarde toi, et apprcie ces petites ou grandes choses que tu possdes ou qui te sont  "porte de main" et apprcie les, puis partage les avec ton entourage, tu verras alors le rsultat. La vie n'est pas injuste. Il faut juste savoir se prendre en main. Les ides ngatives telles que tu les prsentes sont contraires au Bonheur|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	?a n'arrive PAS qu'aux autres.|`|13da02a08930603fe2458a004f20bacaaa	Parce qu'il suffit de croire en sa chance pur qu'elle arrive!  Il faut positiver, c'est un entrainement  faire, et ?a devient automatique!  Si tu es convaincu de ta dfaite ou de ton chec avant mme d'avoir essay, tu pars perdant, et mme si tu avais les capacits pour russir, tu t'es auto-conditionn  l'chec... et tu te plantes!  Aurais-tu peur de la russite? Pose toi la question : as tu peur d'assumer la russite, la chance, les rsultats, le bonheur...?  En regardant tout d'un autre oeil, on relativise, la vie est plus simple, plus belle, et devant une difficult, au lieu de se dire que de toute fa?on on y arrivera pas, on se dit : "j'essaye, si j'y arrive pas, au moins je n'aurais pas le regret de ne pas avoir tent ma chance". Et du coup, on s'investit  fond, et mme les gens viennent plus facilement vers nous quand on respire la "positivit"!!!  Il n'y a pas de hasard, il n'y a que des gens s?rs d'eux.  Laisse une chance au bonheur, l tu lui as fait peur!|`|e68a84775b53288475c37fae911744a8aa	vas en afrique ou en chine  la bas + la moiti 2 la population vit avec - 2 $ par jour, n ont pas de quoi de manger, les parent prostituen leur fille pour quelques centimes, il ne saven pa lire ( pas d ecole )et je te parle pas de leur hygiene.....  et ils representen 60% de la population mondiale  alors, le bonheur n arrive qu aux autres ??|`|66327ccfef183af52b2058b975c8f713aa	PEUT ETRE QUE T ES SUPER MOCHE NUL ET PLEIN DE CRASSE ET CERISE SUR LE GATEAU TU PUES DU  CUL  ALORS NE TE LAMANTES PLUS TU N AS QUE CE QUE TU MERITES|`|1cda15aceb4ff31f6636c53b843bbb90aa	ca peut t' arriver aussi si tu le veux!! patience!|`|f69a17db9cd2430f3fef6654fd38bf14aa	Ce n'est qu'une impression.

t1c8XAA7aa	she has a bf - that makes things complicated all on its own    . i am currently in a situation where i have a bf and this friend of mine has been interested in me for about 1 yr. i am attracted to this other guy but there are so many reasons for me to not leave my bf. i have become so confused and depressed that im not sure what to do. he has tempted me so many times but i cannot bring myself to become the type of girl that i have sworn never to become - a cheater.    it could very well be that she is trying to let you know that she will not cheat on her bf with you - or anyone for that matter. if she wants to be friends still then she probably will only hang out with you in neutral enviroments well lit, public, high traffic hang outs.. not watching a movie at your house. she may feel threatened because of the feelings that she is experiencing.     dont take this the wrong way but back off, dont come on to her as strong. show her relationship (and her) some respect. dont try to tempt her. she says that shes feeling guilty = not a good thing!|`|zWqKuIQuaa	She likes you as a friend, but she wont leave her boyfriend for you.

It doesn't matter how long it takes, if you REALLY like her, you'll wait.|`|7quYBN4gaa	it seems like she respects her boyfriend enough not to cheat...which by all means is a good quality...just back off a little. she knows you like her but she may be confused in what she wants. let her know you'll be there for you. but dont' wait forever!!! there are other fish in the sea!|`|VrmlehM2aa	i think you should just talk to her. i know it sounds easier than it is, but just talk with her and ask her if she is still into you. if she does say yes make sure you dont interfer with her b/f. it will just make an even bigger mess. if you two still have the same feelings with eachother tell her that you do really like her.. (how shes cute and fun to hang with) but that you dont want to mess anything up with her relationship
kvcIdORcaa	they don't know you yet, so they're not in love with your personality or anything. they're young and horny and they just want to use you for sex. that's why they're asking, people treat you the way you let them, so they're hoping you may say yes when they ask. just say no thank you, you're waiting for the right guy.
NUWdgQuraa	Well, a sure-fire way to open with a guy is to compliment him.  Just relax, be friendly.  Connections happen naturally when you act natural.
d5aee213f957717864ff8129c591154baa	Je rpond comme frizounette : Il faut lui poser la question...    Personnellement, je doute qu'une fille que j'aime et pour qui je suis attir puisse le voir simplement. Soit je lui avourais mes sentiments soit ca restera taboo et jamais elle ne le saura sans le demander.     Chacun a sa fa?on d'tre et les signes peuvent tre ou non prsent.    Ce n'est gnralement pas avec les plus timides ou les plus rservs qu'il est difficile de savoir, car lorsque la fille convoite s'approche d'eux, ils ne savent plus comment agir et trahissent leurs sentiment dans une panique gnralement remarquable.  Ils peuvent rougir (et mme devenir carlate), trembler, fuir, begailler, tre paralyser de peur, devenir trs maladroits...    C'est ceux qui sont timides mais calme et repos dans ces cas l et qui ne laisse donc rien ou peu transparaitre de leur amour qui auront le moins de chance de se faire reprer. Les signes sont alors soit totalement invisibles soit rduits et presque imperceptibles. C'est en parlant avec l'intress qu'elle le dcouvrira soit parce que dans ce cas il trouvera le courage de lui avouer, soit parce qu'il voudra lui montrer indirectement en tant attentionn ou soit parce qu'il se trahira dans son comportement.    Les moins timides iront droit au but et provoqueront le face  face, dans ce cas la personne convoite n'aura pas le temps de chercher les signes montrant l'attirance. Que ca soit en la fixant du regard ou en lui avouant directement ce qu'il prouve, il montrera clairement ce qu'il pense...|`|22410df68a3a0d7990ebdabee3717429aa	C'est  toi de voir!!!! mais moi je sais que quand je suis amoureux mon regard s'adoucit regard, et je jette  moindre occasion un regard  la personne qui est entr de me chupper le coeur!!!!  le coeur br?le et les yeux tincellent.......

DGorWR1raa	If you notice it more than once in a day. Shes definitely staring. Stare back at her, and then smile, and look away. There was one time I was staring at this guy, and he like had direct eye contact with me and had this huge grin on his face. I ended up blushing and freaking out a bit. But yea it works, I think it works on most girls. Most girls I know, it would make their hearts melt, a little. c(=
Sb9Nvvu1aa	Talk to her - be honest with her.  Tell her that you still like her, but you have to protect yourself from that kind of devastation again.  If you're willing to forgive/forget then there's no reason why to completely shun her.    Good luck!

WB8uBODtaa	When a guy teases you he wants to tease you. It has nothing to do with liking someone silly ;}|`|AA12113076	hm... sorry, but I don't think he really likes you  and you'd better stay calm and don't tell him anything cuz you're gonna be hurt
YPZICzNjaa	I find teen love the most interesting and sincere      You know what u need to do is to go and set straight things    Talk to him it helps    Anyway, you can try and show him your flirty side once more because then he'll think more of u then ever and such, also you really dont need to worry about these problems because if he truely cares about u, then he will respect your relationship.  I know its hard to move on, but to stay bf and gf you need to make sure thats he is your one and only.  At the age of 15 is a little early to tell with college and everything coming up, but if you love him I say u go for it     gl    -deatgh
zzaScg0haa	It sounds like you are getting bored because you are choosing the girls for the wrong reason
NuzNgXURaa	I've always thought that flirting is all about the eye contact.  You can hold a deep look and then follow with a sweet smile and guys will melt.  You can say so much with your eyes!!! Also, complimenting is very flirty and it makes guys feel so good and comfortable...|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Tips:    http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=tips+on...

Find A Girl That Will Appreciate You... &&  Not Treat You Like They're Your Mom.    I'd Be So Greatful If A Guy Did That For Me  Weather Anyone Showed Up Or Not.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Because she is a miserable, spoilt cow who wants her own way all the time.  Stop doing as she says and tell her that you're sick of her snapping at you. You will find yourself being driven away from her soon if she doesn't stop.  If she gets mad at you when you tell her to stop snapping then just go home, you don't need this crap from her.|`|E9WFPlvVaa	Some people actually nag at others as their way of saying i love you. im like that. just agree with her and whenever she gets mad just be sweet with her. kiss her or say im srry baby,...u no i love you though. she'll love it and calm down some because she knows u love her. =D
N0nYIeNvaa	honestly?  he's not thinking with his brain.  think about it this way, how much more sexual stuff can a 16 year old girl do than a 14 year old one?  he's thinking with his mini me.  if you were a 14 year old boy and had to pick between a 14 year old girl or 16 year old, you'd pick the older one.  every teenage boy would.  hope i helped :)|`|WFRooU7Maa	He could be trying to make you jelous    Best idea:  Just ignore him for a few days and beyond that show bordem around him and pay as little attention to him when hes around    This might make him mad or think you don't like him  and he might pay more attention to you|`|BvgMVNk5aa	hes being a total jerk. I saw move on, he prally just doesnt know wat to say now that he told u he loves you.
VLRkJOOuaa	When you say gangster, do you mean a bunch of posers, or guys that can actually be a bad influence on you?    Personally, I think you should stick with them; it may be your parents' business what you're doing on Saturday night, but sometimes friends understand you better than parents can ever hope to. They seem very sincere too. Lol. Though I don't know them.      It sounds like they helped you find out who the real you is. (:|`|wJstSw9Daa	You don't want to be a gangster unless you want to get into fights a lot and start them for no reason. Just have trouble around you all day and wake up the next day to start trouble again. Shouldn't be giving your mom attitude, think about the consequences, if you turn out bad, you could be kicked out of "YOUR MOMS HOUSE"|`|89cCKrm8aa	Are you sure they're gangster? or they just think they're gangster. but you shouldnt hang out with people like them cause like if you join them and you leave, they're gonna kill you cause they think your gonna rat out on them. But i think they're just posers, so just dont hang out with them anymore|`|O9jrkjgraa	Oh god.....    don't fall into that stupid group! Be yourself!

cewWPIzIaa	Some women are.  Experiences in their lives have taught them that the only way to judge whether they are pretty, sexy, desirable, etc...is by whether they have a man in their life.  It's unfortunate, but some women do feel that way and are afraid to be alone.  On the same note, some men are also afraid to be alone (my ex-husband is a prime example - he never leaves one relationship without another one lined up).    I used to feel that way years ago when my self-esteem was low due to some traumatic experiences in my life.  However, I soon learned to love myself and realize that I had something to offer whether I was single or in a relationship.  Now I would rather be single than in an unhappy relationship.  It's not worth it to be with someone who doesn't make you happy just to avoid being single.|`|jpAzVmG0aa	No.   There are some of course that are like that, but every girl does like the idea of having a man to herself. One that will be there to appreciate and love her. That's what causing some girls to be desperate without a guy by them, because they don't get enough attention and love. But otherwise, women can most certainly stand on their own. I believe everyone has that insecurity, with both genders, some worse than others.|`|QijoFWoCaa	There is no trait in this world that applies to *all* women, just like there is no trait that applies to *all* men.  The answer is, "It depends on the woman."  You should really begin to think of women as individuals, and not as a single entity that you can paint with one brush.
BgVWSApdaa	She could be shy.  I have to admit, when I see a cute guy, I often look away and then kick myself for doing so.|`|7s53MtS3aa	You had spinach between your teeth the first time.    And she found you less interesting the second time due to your lack of spinach, therefore she looked away.

Hes STUPID.|`|AA10997370	You've kinda answered your own question there.....you dont like him, you told him so, so he's backed off. he obviously didnt like you that much anyway if he can just stop his affections llike that. There's only one word for a guy that plays friends off against each other like that....PLAYER!!|`|r3uKj1Azaa	Well you seem to have him sussed....he was interested in you but you aren't interested in him, so he's gone back to "friend mode".    Seems as simple as that really.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	he wants you in bed, and nothing else.   Now he is trying to make you jealous so you come around. Trying to make you chase him so he can get what he wants.    forget this loser, you're better than that.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Hes spat his dummy out now, and his sulking cos u never succumb to his advances, dont lose any sleep over this guy he sounds like a player.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It means since he broke up with your friend(I'm having a hard time believing they were going out for 8 months and you had no idea), he's not getting any. And he was hoping you were "easy".     When he discovered you weren't, he moved on to the next person on his list.|`|IyCnihLmaa	he's just another jerk and not worth your time.|`|zoTbkas9aa	`tyou wanted to be friends so he is treating you like a friend.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	nothing is up with him, he was just trying his luck, he knew you liked him so why not see if he could get sex out of you  have you not asked this question before ??|`|YGZuAl2Caa	I think he's desperate. He chose the "easy" girl. Now, he's relationshipless and you're his next "victim". If you want to be friends with him, you'll have to accept his talk about other girls, which means he instantly switched gears.    This boy is screaming "player".
gJE0ujbzaa	That's always the trouble when you get romantic feelings for a friend:(  While a good friend can also be a fantastic partner(most great relationships start off as good friendships), you also risk losing the friend if they don't have romantic feelings for you.    You need to see if you can talk to her alone.  Tell her you are sorry you asked her out, because her friendship meant a lot to you, and it really hurts to lose it. Ask if you can just cancel the statement, and that while you really do like her and would love to go out with her, if she isn't interested, you'd really really like to keep her as a friend.|`|ADDzZeEHaa	plain and simple ask her whatsup. maybe over coffee|`|Dx23osxWaa	ask her wats the problem and tell her ur story!!|`|T6nmD3X9aa	....and a little bit of chicken fried,  cold beer on a friday night,  a pair of jeans that fit just right  and turn the radio uuuppppppp...      sorry, love that song    anyway, just talk to her. Maybe she is uncomfortable because she had a good friend that new all her secrets now she is weirded out by this....either give her time to figure it out or just ask her!!!!    good luck    ...and a little bit of chicken fried,,,,|`|XWwnf90paa	She obviously didnt feel that was about you and now she feels awkward, reasure her that you would love to continue as just friends and you wont ask her again x x|`|LXK8ktGOaa	awww i am sorry but she is prob avoiding you cuz she doesnt want to hve to deal with turning yu down ... or she is just odd|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Ask and find out. Maybe you hurt her feelings and she feels you are distant from her.|`|AA10741561	It looks like she is now uncomfortable around you.  the only thing you can do is to try and take back what you said and keep the friendship on a purely platonic level.
3hDXqH4Raa	i think love can be blind....and the better you look the more temptation arises|`|NwPjjp9baa	I think that it just depends on the people involved. I think (and have been told by many people) that I am a very attractive girl, yet I haven't had a boyfriend yet... I think sometimes it could be a positive or negative.|`|2uPEty21aa	I'm not really sure what the question is but I can tell you that as I've got older I have noticed there are far fewer unattractive women about.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Everyone has hassles in life and relationships, wether your good looking or not.|`|6aaCfPJiaa	NO|`|cG7z70Vgaa	It all depends on who the woman is paired up with. Depending on their natures they will either have more or less problems.|`|VBtzeVlKaa	I dont think looks get in the way of relationships when the woman (or man for that matter) is mature.    There will always be guys making advances and perhaps even trying to get in the way of the relationship, but if a woman's character is strong, and loves the man she is with, she would never allow it and will remain loyal to her man and send all others packing quickly.    It may be more of a hassle when the woman is younger and is still easily impressed or flattered by other guys' attentions.    So, basically in my opinion it depends on age and maturity, not looks.     Also good looking couples can be just as secure if not more. Again, it depends on the two people involved and their level of maturity, not their appearance.|`|yRRnbNqXaa	Well, I guess I'm not a total scare LOL and I've had problems with my ex boyfriend's jealousy quite a lot. When I went away for college he rang me almost every hour and if I was busy and couldn't answer he'd accuse me of cheating. It got that far that if I moved my leg a bit differently during sex, he assumed I've been doing it with someone else who "taught me" that!!!! Eventually he left me for another girl and explained that "there'll be less trouble with her"!! And I never ever cheated on him, never even flirted with another guy!!!     Then another guy I was in love with told me once that he'd go out with me but can't because he knows too many other guys who'd want to do the same thing and he'd be too jealous.. I didn't know any such guys, so maybe that was just a line :)    Anyway, all of the above are not my problems, but the guys'. If a guy's insecure and self conscious, he'll get jealous no matter how his girlfriend looks.     I had a friend who was VERY good looking (we all thought so), but consciously picked out not too attractive women becase he admitted of being totally insecure and he even said that such a woman would have less chances of cheating on him!!! Which, I think is bull, because if somone wants to cheat he / she will. Looks don't matter much. At the same time, a girl can look like Angelina Jolie and be faithful like no other, even if guys throw themselves at her, because she has just decided that way.    It's all IN the head, not ON it lol
jWAzxHGvaa	:( I am sorry you are going through this. I know exactly what you are talking about. Feelings are so hard to understand and everyone will tell you the same thing, go with your heart, do what you think is best, do what makes you happy. But sometimes you honestly don't know. I think a big problem is that you never had real closure with your ex because once I got closure and realized that I had made the right decision, a HUGE weight lifted off of my shoulders. You are dating so you are not married which means that you don't have to stay with your current bf but choose wisely. Ugh why are relationships so hard huh? Especially when you honestly can't decide between the two. :( Good luck. I hope you figure it out... it is so hard.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...    *How to tell if he likes you  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).    A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.    Shy Guys  These are tough to crack sometimes...  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it    * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)    *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...    *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.    *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.    *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.    *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)    These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!    *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."    *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.    *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.    Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.    *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)    When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)    *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)    *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'    If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.    *He tells you that you smell nice...  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)    *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.    If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com    *Much Love* ~God Bless~|`|8SBQ5StRaa	would you want to sleep with him?   Yes: he doesn't like you  No: he loves you|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	OMG That's what I've been doing Wrong all this Time!! I'ma nice guy and of course I'm naturally respectful and nice to everyone, especially girls of course. But yea nice guys aren'y assertive enough to tell a girl they like them, but they usually show it unconciously by their actions. Sometimes they go Out of their way to do favors for them or say the right words when they are down, etc. I do that even more to a girl I like. But I definately have to work on differentiating between being "nice" and sending signals or being flirtatious. Thanks !|`|7FAZYMy3aa	Maybe he'll take whatever girl likes him
oyjP2mZBaa	Okay, so I'm not a guy, but I'll answer. (:  I would go with Girl A.  I would still be friends with Girl B, though. She seems to be going through an extremely tough time, and people can be there for each other when they're friends; they don't necessarily need to be boyfriend and girlfriend.  Always go with whoever you like the most. It will just make you miserable if you go with someone you don't, which will make your partner feel bad also.  And by you, I don't necessarily mean you...understand? Lol >.

I think they even do the piercings there. it looks really hot.    :P|`|3YpVVRWpaa	she is cute  why??? you look great the way you are not change it|`|0ujpiBTCaa	Tiny studs like that look like zits/moles unless you are 2 inches away...bad idea for anyone.|`|A99uzyeFaa	Yes she can :)|`|z6qIZRFFaa	she can pull off the nose ring, i just don't know about tha makeup|`|Q5KFND17aa	yeah i think she pulls it off about as well as anyone can    and in that specific picture shes pretty/hot but if she was wearing a sexy outfit she'd look sexy, beautiful, etc..  and her makeup looks great|`|glPyjitIaa	yea she looks good in a nose ring. but.... she's pretty and all but he has A LOT of makeup!!!! Dang. Maybe she should try a more natural look. But her eyes nd hair are absolutely GORGEOUS!! I wish I had them *cute cute*
XOOpHjhiaa	She is probably shy around you in person and maybe interested. Don't you find it easier to talk 2 some1 u like in a text than in person? Or she is playing hard to get. Ask her out casually like to the movies with a couple friends as to not be TOO obvious but see it she shows any signs of liking you back?    Good Luck!|`|hDAoKmjPaa	she is probably too shy to chat in person. she probably feels more comfortable through text.|`|KRDwCai5aa	She feels more comfortable texting than talking face to face. She's probably shyy.|`|vM8QTupsaa	I'm sorry but she doesn't like you back =[|`|hfNXDCPQaa	She's probably shy. She feels more comfortable with texting, because it is not face to face.|`|Ck4IiUauaa	maybe because she's shy...|`|681YZGThaa	She is shy and has some low self esteem problems. She doesn't feel like she will ever be enough (that's what she thinks)|`|n91Wf2jeaa	It's way easier to be open, outgoing and yourself when not speaking face to face. Maybe she is shy go up to her but don't put her on the spot. ^.^
QrOJ8f7aaa	I would date a shy guy but I don't think I would ask him out on account of the fact that I'm a little shy too.|`|Tf19RETiaa	yeaa im shy myself, and maybe i would ask them out like in a text or   IM or myspace|`|2H3XU94Caa	I would, but that's just cause he fits my personality.  Ask him over to watch a movie with group of friends.|`|ZSBkDyAGaa	well i would b/c if they are shy that means they wont cheat,want sex,be touchy,and once he warms up to you he'll get comfy with you.    just talk some everyday fora while and then get flirty and then as him out and give him some reasons so he can say yes.|`|qiWgo90zaa	oh course, m dating a shy guy. they are always the sweetest. unless the guy is an idiot. haha|`|MxOURY0Gaa	depending on how he looked maybe.|`|xR3F2RFnaa	awwww shy is cute and id only ask them out if i knew they liked me|`|swrlL30Aaa	it depends but i would ask him out. You should give him a chance. If you do ask him out make sure that if you do it in person he is comfortable talking with you and if he isnt i would do it on text. But ya you should defenitly ask him out... because you never know.. he might just change your life...?
NqMmvvgVaa	Well it doesn't sound good. Not many girls would be ok with what he said. But at the same time, maybe he just wasn't good at expressing what he meant. I can understand that as wrong as it is to cheat, people don't want to lose what they have by telling their partner. Also, some people say that telling the person only releases your own guilt, but causes a hell lot of turmoil for the person you cheated on. He may have even in a way been saying to you that he wouldn't want to know either, because it would hurt the both of you too much.  I don't know though, you might wanna talk to him about that again.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	If he wouldn't tell you then he probably cheated on you.|`|f512X3itaa	dont act like girls arent difficult yall dont tell stuff either|`|W88S5Xjiaa	Who on earth wants to tell on themselves??? Have you ever seen a little kid walk up to someone and say *Yeah, I did eat 4 cookies before dinner, what of it?* NEVER! Would you tell someone if you cheated? If so then you are a very big person.|`|GCufUbxJaa	The only reason he said that is because if he did tell you, you would probably leave him for cheating anyways. If guys dont tell you then the two of you stay together. but i agree with the other guy, girls are difficult about stuff like this too.|`|8jHe4W1Uaa	used reverse psychology ! tell him u talked to the girl u think he was cheting on you with! make sure you look like your tellin the truth! if you kno a lil info use that and blow it out! i hope i helped you!!!!|`|FPONPOlHaa	i am a guy and i am honest but if u want him to tell the truth, put him on that lie detector test that's on TV
c4BPvxz9aa	i dont think valentines day is a time for masculin gifts its a time for har felt gifts get him a card something personal it doesnt have to be in front of his friends write something that will make him feel loved that always gets me when a girl makes me feel like she cares a bout me and u know hot they say that the way to a mans heart is through his stomach invite him to have dinner with u at ur house and make something he would like hope it works out :-)|`|vCSsbwDraa	maybe chocolate hearts, its valentines its not suppose to be something aboutt hiim...cause its not his birthday   so it has to be something lovable hhee. :)|`|ILdgVBLGaa	oh my! it is very hard to find good gifts for guys...  u should write him a card  telling why u like him and how cute he is|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	two tickets with you and him to a football game.  or, you guys could go bowling and you fork out.    or just do nothing (;|`|I59dkJksaa	nothing cheesy haha get his cell number and aend him a cute valentine one lol sort cheesy i no|`|258mrT2Paa	well as your into Macroeconomics and his into sport get him some small balls.|`|Z3a1cRL7aa	It's Valentines day, it's supposed to be either cheesy or sexy.  At this point I would say you should avoid sexy, you don't want to send the wrong signal and make him think your easy.  If you want to involve bowling or football, get one of those boxes of Valentines Cards that you used in grade school that has football players on them and give him one of those with a nice personal message on the back.  Nothing says Valentines like "Your a Great Catch" with (insert players name) standing in the background.  Trust me, it will work|`|X7OvS3mjaa	girls dont get guys anything for valentines day this is a totally chic holiday !|`|0XWVUMCAaa	try cologne|`|lAbVvmRoaa	what be yourself if you want someone to like you|`|F9WyYPYlaa	A gift card to Sports Authority.
tu8pZ6veaa	dude she like u TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (i have classes with her) i know (give me ten points)|`|5ILhLrn0aa	if this is a middle school crush i'm not taking this serious because those girls don't kno what they want
2H8jUmBoaa	Are you a time traveler? Because if I'm not mistaken, Oct '09 has not happened yet.
Z3a1cRL7aa	Do not play hard to get.  Ask him what the deal is, tell him that you still have feelings for him and that you want to know if he has any for you.  If you do nothing, you will always wonder what he was thinking, and you won't ever have closure.  I commend you for telling him that you liked him four months ago, that can be hard to do.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Ask him out? You eighth graders are morons...|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Oh my God. There are limits to the "playing hard to get" game. Lol. If he is trying, then you should throw him a bone. Jesus. Why would you ignore him!!!|`|8h2P3Gyyaa	Well this guy like you a lot. You should just talk to him more and see where it goes and fast before he starts liking someone else.|`|0qNuPw5taa	well it seems like he might like you but you should talk to him to get things straightened out.|`|cR3M6tepaa	Well he loves you :) and u like him . Instead of playing hard to get give him a chance cuz u know its hard for a guy to get at a girl. When he flirts flirt back cuz he might end up being the one ; )|`|mAOjAd6laa	wtf enjoy life don *** up ur too young don fall in love cuz is gonna hurt wen ur young trust me jus *** Lol|`|xMdKVKTyaa	He obviously likes you too so come on and get him haha I'm in ninth grade and they don't play those games in high school so no playing hard to get missy XD|`|B92xHBDKaa	Apparently this guy is dying for your attention. So maybe the playing hard to get routine isn't exactly working out. Maybe if you were to start talking to him when he calls your name or tries to get your attention, he will let you know what's up. And by the looks of it, he probably likes you back.
UZ2nix6xaa	Honesty is always the best policy in a relationship. If he doesn't feel the same way about you then there's no point in trying to change his mind about it. If you really feel that strongly about him, he'll see that and hopefully he feels the same way.|`|iJmafJWBaa	i think he knows you are clear about what you want.  but if he doesnt want the same then move on suckaa.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	You need to just express your feelings like you described and find out what he wants.  If he doesn't want the same things, as hard as it may be, you need to let him go.  It will hurt for a while, but it will be better for you in the long run.  You don't want to be with someone who isn't as committed to making things work as you are.    Be open, honest, and go from there.|`|NdEubhZhaa	Time to move on honey.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Just do your best and hope for the best.  You can't change someone's feelings, and right now, you don't know what he's feeling.  Maybe he feels the same way, maybe not.  But just go and put yourself out there.  What do you have to lose?|`|KfQKvToqaa	If he says that he feels differently, then just leave at that and be civil about the whole thing. Don't push it.     Good luck. :)
5a3515e1ca3ac0285f0ad981d59ba082aa	Makes you think About the person 24/7  Obsessed  Wanting to be with the person Forever an  24/7  But its not a good thing when your young  im 14.  I fell in love.  At least i thought i was...  you never experiance love   when you think you are.  at time|`|AA12226369	its makes me feel good and i wish the woman i was in love with was still in love with me|`|2290af33af8733d7c4e2f1c9cecb824aaa	its graet you feel relaxed and like nothing someone says will mater. it asom but sometimes you fall out of love as easily as you fell in!|`|e6d9e5f499c13f7e5db678b2f420ecebaa	Yes! It makes me feel very seducitive.  But I like it!|`|3345ddc96c142002174ec6cb5d17c4b6aa	beginning stages are ruff because you are so obsessed about everything but once you realize how much you complete each other in  that she truly love you as much as you love her words cant explain the feeling|`|ca77cfd60dc99eb382e0fac493ebd286aa	Totally upset. To fall in love with someone that drives you insane, but your in love with them and couldnt bare to let them go. Thats my idea of love....or at least what im living.
tFC13Xsgaa	just be yourself|`|AA11441704	Make it simple|`|8FLJueRjaa	just be nice say hey when u see her  act confident because u know u r good enough for her    start lookin stuff up on thing s she is interested in    for example if she likes sports go to ESPN    if she likes animals look up news on animal cruelty and what not    ___--Hitch|`|362adadcf07b8c4be23f083bb0e84126aa	just talk to her ask hows it going and you can tell by the way she responds whether you should pursue her or not|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Study some poetry, art or something so you can speak about something deep and meaningful.  the girls will eat this stuff up!|`|v3e6NDYbaa	A) the only things that hamper you getting with a girl are the barriers you have in your head    B)Never ask if she has a boyfriend.  If you absolutely must, then casually say 'so been on any interesting dates lately?'    C)I will now give away my magical secret of how to get to know a woman while simultaneously have her think you are the coolest guy of all time.  It will sound weird but I've done it many times and it works EVERY time.      Check out: http://www.personalityquiz.net/relationa...  Memorize it and practice it with other people then give it to her from memory and analyze her answers and how they apply to her personality.  Its like chick crack.  Its easy and fun and girls go nuts for it.|`|A2O6t6T7aa	flattery is your best bet. Here's a trick: give her a nice, honest, medium-sized comment like: wow your hair is even better up close then casually stroll away. She will 9 times outa ten come up to u and want to know u more.  wait till u know her more 2 find out if she has a bf    Hope I could help!!!|`|uGRS7ldmaa	Be yourself always. What is to be will be. Have casual conversation with her, and you both will find out eveything, you need to know about each other. I don't think the grade will be an issue. Just relax and have fun. Dress for the occassion.|`|Q2KBTqvhaa	well all i can say is just be cool about it. casually talk to her. and if she says she has a boyfriend, dont be pushy!! this one guy asked me if i had a boyfriend, and i said no. and then he still asked me for a kiss! wtf. so n e ways back to u, the age thing might be a lil turn off for her because for the most part girls wanna date someone older not younger but maybe she wont mind.|`|0pqZsSRYaa	it depends if you've met her before or not...    1) want to get to know her:         strike up a casual conversation and ask about what she's been doing lately if she's been reading any cool books lately... if she's seen any good movies, planning to travel anytime soon, how's school going(if she's in school)    2)dont want to come off as creepy- if you dont know her then dont ask her all the wuestions in number 1. just introduce yourself dont use a cheesy pick up line and be casual.     3) boyfriend?y/n: if you do know her, you say, yeah so lately i havent been doing much, went on a couple blind dates but none of the girls really sparked my interest. no luck in the love dept. what about you?    4) grade school???you should probably just go for it... don't worry whatother people say because in the end the only ones that matter will be the ones that you actually talk to for al least a year out of school...|`|tKBLSm1uaa	Okay, dudes! Move over cuz I am a girl. So, a really big is perfect! Because it does not come off as creepy or stalkerish. Which is something you obviously do not want. Go up to her and talk casually. I mean it! I mean if a guy came up to me and started reciting poetry I would be hella creeped out. Do not listen to that guy that told you that. Well, he is sort of right cuz you could give your girlfriend a poem. But not ALL girls "eat that up". And we do not like guys being rude. It is so pathetic if they are. But do not go all formal either. Just compliment on her hair, dress or something. The guy that liked me walked up to me when I was taking a picture and told me he had the same camera. I laughed and asked him if he had the same picures too. It was really funny and that is how he thought I met him, but in actually I already knew him. So maybe this girl already knows you. So just be yourself! That is really all you can do is just be yourself. If she does not like it then get over her cuz it is definately not worth than trying to be someone you are not. =)|`|q0SenAFsaa	My advise is to be yourself and be confident.  If you cannot be yourself when you are around a girl, she is not good for you.  If you have to change who you are because she cannot accept the original you, then you will eventually be unhappy.    Eye contact is very, very, VERY important.  And did I mention that eye contact is very important?  Occasionally look away from her eyes to look at her other facial features.  Watch her lips and her smile while she is talking and look at how her hair gracefully frames her face.  But make sure that her eyes are your focal point.    Her boobs are not her eyes.  Enough said.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking away from her face and glancing at her body when she is telling a story or rambling, but if you spend longer than one second looking away from her face, she will notice (especially if you are checking her out).  Where to look and for how long while in a conversation is basically a science.  Be careful.  Most importantly, never look away long enough to get distracted from what she is saying, because if she is telling you something, it is important to her.    Genuinely listen to her.  Any prick can ramble on about himself, then pretend to listen to her.  And I'm sure she will be able to tell the difference.  Ask her questions about herself.  Ask her what she likes and what she dislikes?  Talk to her about HER hobbies and if you have similar hobbies.  Especially talk about things that you have in common.    Watch the movie Hitch with Will Smith.  Hitch does give some good ideas for how to spark initial attraction.    Find out what she likes.  If she likes a certain sport (especially if she plays it), then learn a little about that sport and talk to her about it.  If she plays an instrument, talk about it.  Even if you know nothing about music, you can still at least find a beautiful classical song or musical theatre song that you can say "Hey, you know what song I think is awesome...?"  BASICALLY find out what her interests are and do some research.  Looking at the news for recent stories on these specific topics work well to, and it makes you sound like you really keep up-to-date on it.    Compliment her.  Women love compliments.  But do not be too creepy.  There is nothing wrong with saying something like "the color of your shirt really brings out your pretty blue eyes."  Saying it like this compliments her clothing choice (her personal opinions) as well as her natural beauty, packaging one huge compliment into a very simple sentence (while remaining completely appropriate).  Be more descriptive than "that looks good".  Talking about perfume smell or hair smell can be considered creepy by some girls, so stick to a safe visual compliment.    DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to what other people might think of you.  First off, if you like this girl, don't be ashamed of it.  Second, even if other people have a bad opinion of you, that will only last a few days at most.    You must be in middle school or something if you really see a "one grade" difference as enough to prevent a relationship.  A one grade difference can be as little as one month or as much as a year and a half (which still isn't a lot).  In the real world, most couples have a few year difference.  In fact, my girlfriend and I have a three year difference.  She is a junior in high school (17 years old) and I am second year in college (20 years old).  We both love each other the same.    After talking for a little bit, you can hint around at her relationship status.  One way that I might think of doing it is when she says something, respond "what does your boyfriend think of that?"  If she replies as if she has a boyfriend, just keep the conversation going and let it roll off you as if you don't care if she has a boyfriend.  If she says that she doesn't have a boyfriend, then just say "oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know why, but I thought you did."  THEN (this is probably the hardest part), just drop the boyfriend topic for a little while.  This will probably leave her wondering and thinking about you...    If she replies that she doesn't have a boyfriend, then you can make a little bit of a move, but don't be too aggressive.  Toward the end of the conversation or toward the end of the day together, you can simply ask her if she would like to do something with you some other time (and hint at a day).    Have something in mind.  It would probably be a failure for you to say "wanna hang out sometime?" even if she would say yes to this.  You would be better off saying something like "Can I meet you at the coffee shop on Saturday and buy you a coffee?" or "I hear that there is a good movie at the cinema.  Can I take you on, say, Friday night?"  It would also be a good idea to first find out if she likes coffee or what kind of movie she likes and suggest the movie by name.      Either way, if she has a conversation with you and gives you her undivided attention, that is a good start.  If the conversation lasts longer than five minutes, she is at least interested in getting to know you better.    Oh, and don't be afraid to nonchalantly ask her for her number.  "Hey, can I have your number and call you later?"  Don't call her right away unless she tells you to because that would probably come off as desperate or needy.  If she gives you her number and does not tell you when to call her, wait for at least a day (24 hours), but not longer than three days (depending on  why you are calling her).  If she does give you her number and tells you to call her later that night, DO IT and be on time.    Good luck!
u6btDDWZaa	is offensive|`|VERrlErvaa	Back in the '70's, prostitutes would be described as "turning tricks" - that is still a term used today, although I imagine that younger generations now spell it differently.  Basically if they say you are turning trix, it means they think you're a slut and whore.    Fairly basic really.      If you are hanging around guys like this, then take my advice and run the other way, love.  They are not worth your time or energy.   They only want to use you and have no respect for you.|`|zcLhvM83aa	a trick is a hoe, slut, bust it, slide. whoever said this is really disrespecting you and women around the world. and for a comeback say ya mother.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	someone to sleep with..sex.|`|WV36m31Zaa	being easy .. no respect for themslves|`|DlGV1xv9aa	its a song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJxvi767...  it says "bitches ain't **** but hoes and trix..."  and i think its offensive.. just sayin|`|knYpvAOyaa	I want to say yes.. it sounds like when a girl is a "trix" they are tricking them into thinking they are interested. I could be wrong...|`|YmgDYfbvaa	ive never heard it before but i guess it means the same thing|`|rzSEPWlWaa	A trick is pretty much the same thing as a hoe. Also referred to as a quick hook-up.|`|vnJBGhCVaa	tricks means prostitutes    It's derived from the phrase 'turning tricks' meaning she has another "client"    In any case it's just as offensive as calling a girl hoe or any other degrading name.
AA10566329	a video game
4YK4tBW5aa	I can't say whether he still "has feelings for you" -- especially since you don't share the circumstances of your breakup -- but he definitely still thinks about you often, and when he sees you, his heart jumps a little.|`|AA10240928	Feelings can take a while.  But sex is pretty much instant.  If you want his junk, I'm sure he'll give it to you at a drop of a hat.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Still love him huh! That's okay it happens.|`|gG2CuoF8aa	aww, why did you guys break up? lol.|`|WqRAWA4Yaa	..........wow.....i'm just like that guy except it was 46 days   and havn't had a girlfriend since.....though i still talk to her   (my ex)    i don't think the he  (or myslef)  will ever    REALLY   move on.    just enough though to start a new relationship|`|qpAYU8Knaa	He must be wishing that he was still with you and is there anything under the sun that he can do to get you back.  Guys never forget their first love and always feel hurt when they bump into them.|`|wM4y5Pz3aa	and how do you know he loved you???\   just cuz he told you???  yeah you'll never know what was going on on his mind.   but you hope it was that way.|`|IWvwnIHPaa	Us guys never totally move on, we always have feelings for our ex-girlfriends,  Its just something we do.    His feelings may not extremely strong anymore but there will still be there.  He probably just thinks about when you were together when he see's you.|`|kts8IEoUaa	Just depends on the guy and how much you meant to him.    I can speak from experience, in a relationship like that, it would take quite a while for me to get over you, 2 years is quite a while, but on the other hand if he was ready to separate from you than he would probably go looking for a new girl soon.    He probably thinks nothing of you as a friend, if he's already had 2 other girls|`|xBxAD5NZaa	depending if you broke up with him, he probably has not gotten over you.|`|o4RBNqrHaa	perhaps if you are still in the picture then it is hard to get over the ex.  If the break is clean and he is in a new circle then a month into a new relationship should be enough.   But if he keeps coming back to you...he's not over you AT ALL.  if you don't want him to have these hang ups you should really leave him alone and vice versa.  Its really hard do do but it's the best thing to do.|`|fCA0mm4caa	It depends on how much he liked you, and if he actually loved you, cos some guys are really good at pretending, and can throw phrases like "i love you" and "you mean the world to me" as if they were nothing. About 2 years ago i was dumped by this girl that i was crazy about, and although i have gotten over her and been in other relationships since, she comes into my mind every now and then, but i can't stand talking to her
7d3d6055f9dc6ecc99ef3bac91624614aa	Depends on where you're walking and what time of day it is. I would get to know a guy better before I would let him walk me home, but then again, she's not me.|`|ca77cfd60dc99eb382e0fac493ebd286aa	no. if its light outside and your walkin home from school than its all good.    Just let her kinda lead. That way it wont creep her out, even if she already knows that you know where her house is....women are wierd like that.|`|bb255346df9dc4be35983f829b0cafbcaa	I don't think that is creepy because then you will get to know her more. you know were she lives so i would ask her to walk home too! I have done the same thing and now we are best friends.
0QX6U31Zaa	um first of all if they break up you should let your friend know how you feel about this guy and not go behind her back because that's the worst thing you can do to a friend. If you really like this guy then you should just be yourself and not try to be someone else and if he doesn't like you, just think it's his loss and move on, but if he does like you then you should get with him but only if your friend knows about it and that she is ok with it. Remember never let a guy ruin the relationship with you and a good friend, because they have been there for you longer than that guy has :) hope this helps you and good luck|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Not so much you can do.  Guys either like a girl, or they don't.  There is no logic behind it.|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	tell him you wanna do things with him that he will never forget|`|rh12tX8Naa	you can't do that to your friend. That's messed up!|`|wQSsw8QHaa	you dont be yourself if he dont like that then hes not for you|`|AA12142423	well then don't do it.     if it's meant to be, it will find its way.    deception is a b****.|`|NYqivyA2aa	if there relationship is strong ,no much, but if it's not SO strong then maybe it mite work first you have to learn his interests then take it from there as in if you get anywhere with that then you should keep on going in to his interests ,your friend? ohh..... well she might be a little upset but she will get over it!|`|a8HFTnCKaa	There's a really cute what at school?  Panda Bear?|`|AkHJHUJ1aa	Dont do it, she is your friend how would you like  it if someone did that to you|`|Bg524kqOaa	you deserve that boy just as much as she does. make them break up. feel all sorry for her, then go out with him.|`|4GmeIopoaa	Umm obviously this girl isnt your friend if you are going to back stab her like that.    No guy wants a Slut so I would just leave him alone if he's not single.|`|s88xJ20Saa	well first of all he has a bf so forget about it for now..become friends with the kid and let him start to like you..be talkative and dont be shy..also dont let the other girl know you like him just try to be friends with him and relationships dont last forever so when they break up hell have you|`|QuEU8Mh2aa	i know you dont wanna heare it but guys arent worth friendships. if you really like him then wait it out. font try to break them up, just waitfor it to happen on its own. and after it does wait somemore you dont want to be the rebound. ask her to see if it would ruin your friendship if you went out with him and if she says it would hurt her, back off and let it go. there are others out there this jst wasnt meant to be. but if shes fine with it after you given her sometime figure out if he likes you the same way.|`|a9xITT0Aaa	Your Friend Is With Him? That's Messed Up Homie!  Atleast Wait Till They Break Up Damn.. How Would   You Like It If Your Friend Tried To Steal Your Bf...   And It Doesn;t Matter If They Look Good Together   Or Not.. It's What They Feel For Eachother..    Now If He Likes You And Is Flirting With You...  You Really Don't Want hat Kinda Guy  Because If He's That Low To Flirt With Someone   When He's With Someone Already..   What MakesYou Think He Might Not Do It To You.|`|KVCkcMokaa	Bless ya.....Do it, your young, your supposed to make mistakes like these....friends are always the most important at school trust me, not relationships!|`|5v182WOLaa	satify him... "~"|`|pMh6vXOjaa	ok... even though that is kinda messed up. but just try to be his good friend. get close enough so he can come to you with his problems and talk to you when his girlfriend makes him mad. and tell him what ever he wants to hear. and what ever you do don't tell him you like him. rushing things is a big no no, and good this happen in time.. so be his friend and give it time....|`|JqzFzavCaa	GIRL..... do not it!! you should known this from the moment he got with your friend he is off limits. Even if she breaks up with him, you can not go with him. ITS THE GIRL CODE.   Guys come and go, NOT best-friends. SO this if guy is worth losing your friend than hay...but I SAY NO. i BET YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE BETTER.

Answer that for yourself - Do you like a girl that is good to you or a girl that is always putting you down? A persons' gender does not come into it.|`|ufSXgO1Baa	Women do really like good guys. We like to feel special and loved, and every girl thinks 'good guy' when she thinks long term.|`|iEZ4j0kuaa	yes, of course:)|`|rmC59Zv9aa	girls will always say that they want a nice guy.. but the really dont until there older like 28|`|aIEkNM0Paa	you have to be rude and nice at the same time :D.. women are weird :)|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	the good guys...really    i wouldn't lie to you and i am a woman
cKRFgEr9aa	Skinny curvy girls are definitely the hottest. You should try to get that shape. A nice hairstyle works too. I suggest swept to the side bangs|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	True and natural sex appeal is a very subtle and almost indefinable thing.  You either have it or you have not.    But this does not mean most normal people cannot learn how to be sexy.    Flashes of thigh, a cheeky twinkle in the eye, a perky walk, shy looks, a fresh body smell, a pleasant happy attitude, a willingness to be chatty, standing close to someone   - all these things are sexy.  It`s called `body-language`  You learn to send signals with your body.
i6WVPncnaa	I don't know what girls you date, but I am not that kind of girl.  I try to find my life partner and that is why I date.  I try to find true love.  Once I have found him, then sex comes with the whole relationship.  Its a given.
AA12272885	He is insecure and doesn't trust you plain and simple, plus he has bought into the typical male/female double standard.  That he has a right to interrogate you, but you should not question what he does.  That is because he thinks he is superior.     Keep in mind that you cannot change him, you can only change yourself.  So stop letting him call the shots, don't tell him what you are doing. You don't owe him explanations when it just feeds his jealousy.|`|AA10466438	Dump his butt.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Tell him to loosen up  Or start acting like this to him to show him what its like    Maybe tell him he sounds like your mom and that maybe  he should stop being such a woman|`|kBmL1m3Eaa	why don't you tell him that. be direct with him. he can't fix the problem if he doesn't know what it is.|`|Hj5sXNI7aa	well, yes he is insecure. He thinks you are a better person than he is. He doesn't want you to go out with others, because, he knows what he does when he goes out. You will NEVER change his mentality. Forget that one. You have to set boundaries, and say, "Look, I trust you and I expect you to do the same, if you cannot, then I have to say, I will have to go on without you." If he cannot trust you, this is bad. It will Only get worse. Don't tie yourself down for a guy that is so controlling. Your young, is this what you really want? It sounds like you want to go out and enjoy yourself to me. He is like an anchor. He knows what he is doing, get the blinders off your eyes. He wants his cake and eat it too. You say love, I say infatuation. You need to consider how you want to live, and with this guy, you are being controlled. Good luck.|`|3jgGz7dEaa	WELL I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM TOO AND WELL IF U LIKE HIM INTODUCE HIM TO UR FRIENDS AND IF HE KEEPS ACTING THAT WAY I SUGGEST U LEAVE HIM CAUSE HE SOUNDS LIKE IF HE DOESNT TRUST U SO TALK TO HIM AND MABE EVERY THING WILL GO OK|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Seeing is believing he has to learn to trust like excersising a muscle. He will get better over time. Many men are insecure that is just the way it is.
HmPZnO4naa	no that is not weird at all.    and no not on the first date definately not, that just shows that you are fast and plus first dates are to get to know eachother in a non-physical way.  but a second date is always good, when you kiss dont get nervis and dont be stiff, a kiss is meant to explore your partner, do just that. not too much tongue though women hate that, its really gross|`|nHi1mioBaa	Noh,its not weird for a 14 y/o to not have the first kiss yet  i mean,your ONLY 14  not saying ur too young tho lolz  anyway  to me,its kinda weird for a guy to kiss me on first date  unless i've known him for a long time and we used to be good friends  if that guy kiss me on 1st date it would be sweet and sooo romantic  but if i know a guy for just a while,we dont understan each other that much  it would feel soooooo weird if he kiss me  but if ur really want to,kiss her on the cheek|`|cdUCCHgaaa	its cool to be a kissing virgin. i would do some research on how to kiss to touch up and look for tips. just make sure she wants to kiss you. AND NO TONGUE ON THE FIRST DATE UNLESS SHE DOES IT FIRST! cuz then we find it weird.|`|CKWABfYIaa	well im 13 and my bf kissed me the first day i went out with him n it was my first kiss so i was really nervous also because i had only been goin wit him 4 2 hours so far at the time so i think you should kiss her know i think she would b happy.
CEqYjcBeaa	Cuddling is generally a sign of affection. So from his perspective if he is just there to "knock one out", then yeah it is probably weird to him. If you start getting to a cuddling point with him it will only be a matter of time before feelings start to develop and someone gets hurt.|`|7V79OMMHaa	You have to accept the possibility that he could just be telling you that to make things run smoother. FWBs doesn't mean that there is no affection like the guy above me said, just no commitment, so don't expect any.      Stay Cool|`|2imXzBHbaa	I have thought about this before. There are different levels of FWB. FWB doesn't necessarily mean there is no affection. It just means there is no commitment.
0c18fb0fecfd7c8e63271bcb9476acbbaa	Yo te puedo contar lo que me paso a mi:  La verdad que yo nunca pense en poder conocer a alguien por internet y finalmente me sucedio,conoci a la persona mas maravillosa del mundo chateando.Ella era de mar del plata a 400 km de donde yo vivo(digo era porque ahora les voy a contar la historia).En mi trabajo tengo acceso a internet por el trabajo que hago y en los momento que no tengo mucho trabajo chateaba,ahora ya no,y un dia chateando con un amigo me cuenta que estaba hablando con una chica de mar del plata y me invito a la conversacion,empezamos a hablar de lo que nos gustaba y de lo que no y de muchas cosas mas que en este momento no me acuerdo.Coincidiamos en muchas de las cosas de que hablabamos y asi fueron pasando los dias y seguiamos hablando todos los dias(durante 15 dias),hasta que un dia ella estaba mal porque trabajaba en un ciber y la gente la trataba muy mal y yo me ofreci a llamarla para hablar un poco y conocer aunquesea su voz,me dio su telefono y la llame,me acuerdo que habremos hablado no mas de 2 minutos y me alcanzo para pensar en ir a conocerla.Me acuerdo que estabamos en el mes de octubre y estaba cerca el fin de semana largo del 12 de octubre(dia de la raza) y arreglamos para conocernos,llegado el dia me acompa?o un amigo mio porque la verdad que solo no me animaba a ir,no por miedo sino que yo era y sigo siendo timido.Solo nos conociamos por medio de fotos que nos enviabamos por mail.Cuando llegamos con mi amigo en mi auto a mar del plata fuimos hasta la casa,ella vivia sola con una amiga,tocamos el timbre y bajo,la verdad que no podia pensar en nada ,estaba muy nervioso,entramos a la casa y hablamos durante muchas horas hasta que nos fuimos a registrar a un hotel que esta a 2 cuadras del departamento de ella.A la noche salimos,fuimos a un boliche que iba ella siempre con las amigas y en ese lugar fue donde nos besamos por primera y desde ese momento no nos quisimos separar nunca mas,pero habia un problema,era la distancia que nos separaba,entonces yo empeze a viajar cada 15 dias y despues de unos meses viajaba todos los fines de semana para estar junto a mi princesita hermosa.La verdad que necesitaba estar cerca de ella y no veia la hora de que llegara el fin de semana para ir a verla.Yo trabajo hasta las 16:00 y sacaba el pasaje de micro,porque a la semana de haberla conocido vendi el auto,para las 18:30 y llegaba a la casa a las 01:00 am.Estabamos todos los fines de semana juntos y me costaba mucho volverme,no queria,queria quedarme con ella.Asi estuvimos hasta que nos casamos,nos conocimos el dia 12 de octubre del 2004 y nos casamos el dia 16 de junio 2006(hace poquito) y la verdad que soy el hombre mas feliz del mundo por estar junto a ella.  Un dia hablando le pregunte:  No te dio miedo de dejarme entrar a tu casa sin nisiquiera conocerme antes?  ellla me dijo:yo te conocia con lo poco que hablamos me di cuenta de que eras una persona muy buena y hermosa por eso te invite a mi casa,no tenia miedo.  Bueno espero que te haya gustado mi historia.  Saludos|`|efc5b302f51972ae3651052deeb74469aa	Existen las posibilidades, aunque no hubo tiempo para decrselo, he conocido a una persona de otro pas de la cual me he enamorado...

Dan!|`|85fb23505366187725d55fbaf717c16eaa	si tu quieres si, la distancia es dificil pero no imposible y menos con el amor por el.medio,yo conoci a un chico con el que estuve tres a?os de mi vida, y era dificil poder verlo pero llegamos a vernos, a enamorarnos y luchadno dia a dia se consigue, si hay amor no importa la distancia. Si de verdad sientes algo lucha, y aunque la gente te diga que es imposible, que tan lejos que bla bla no hagas caso, te digo yo que el amor existe aunque aun no conozcas a las personas, puedes enamorarte por una palabra, por su teernura, por tu forma de tratarte, y cuando lo veas en persona ya seras una persona enamorada.
OQvBT2Ssaa	It's 100% normal! But unless you really want to give it another go, leave the past in the past. He is your ex for a reason. You need a transitional guy!!! So make some new guy friends, they will help you clear your mind of all these ex thoughts!|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yeah, it's normal.  You are remembering the good times, and because it was your first relationship, even though it is over and you are not good dates for each other, it formed the benchmark against which you will evaluate all your other relationships.  Hopefully you'll remember that it ended, too, LOL!|`|hgBSYQmBaa	yes it's normal, just ignore it unless you want to get back with him|`|JHfxwDsqaa	no its normal. do what the first guy said|`|T4zxS0hIaa	it is very normal there are feelings there and they will come back for the rest of you life, i still have thoughs little flash backs every now and then, and i am married with children and i love my family... its just part of your life... happy moments that you remeber, belive me it is normal... hope this helps...|`|DOSUTY74aa	honey, we are so the same. it has been a year and two months since we broke up and i still miss him A LOT! just recently i viewed his friendster account and saw that he already has a new girlfriend. they were commenting each other saying i love you and stuff. the next thing i knew i was crying.|`|j2sXQ4Yraa	things will get better in time.  everything happens for a reason.  but it's completely normal.  i know exactly how you feel.    me and my ex broke up.  and he was my first boyfriend.  and i was his first gf.  he broke up with me because he knew he was making me unhappy.  and he didn't treat me right.  & we don't talk anymore =/ (mostly cause of him)  like im willing to be friends and such.  but he says its just awkward.    95% of my mind has moved on but when i hear a song he sung a lot or things that reminded me of our good times, i just cant help it. it just appears. it's NORMAL.    but i didn't let it took over me. hence the 95% moved on.  i opened my heart. stayed single.  tell myself that this is only one life i have and lived it happily so far (:  and things get better in time.  it's been a year and I found the most amazing guy ever.  he's such a sweetheart.
UDKLeWd2aa	maybe you are just being care full and trying to be you know a good guy, i think its normal and it mite also be cuz you area good person, so my advice is try to ignore these thoughts and after some time you may not notice them|`|w6DJj1a8aa	well if she really likes you then you have nothing to worry about like when i'm really into someone there all i see and like i don;t look at other guys in that way sooooo cheer up =)|`|yr1xv9ohaa	dont put yourself down...she wouldnt have to you she liked you if she didnt like you, so she likes you for a reason...dont worry bout messing up, things will play out how they're supposed to!|`|3QNPMVd5aa	omg! i feel like this tooo!  i think you just need to build up some confidence and realize that she DOES like you and  yeah you may think that there are other guys out there that seem soo much better than you so why would she like you, she must be mistaking, i guess you should think of it like wow, im her type, she likes me and not those other guys, i have what she wants!  hehe i hope i helpeddd!x3|`|g59U5kwUaa	yep....you really like this gurl youu feel this way bcus you like her so much it cant be helped i dont think im sorry ;-d|`|HmPZnO4naa	Dude i am saying this in a totally heterosexual way but there are always going to be hotter guys and you cant fix that but you can be the best thing for her, just give her what she needs. you should be at least a little positive about yourself women like a little cockyness just dont over do it.   as for the jelous prob, all girls talk to guys and like i said, be the best thing for her is you. make her believe it|`|43B7XLhfaa	if shes been liking you for a while, just keep doing what your doing. shes not gunna like if you change because you think she'll like a new you more. and if she said shes liked you for a while it usually doesn't go away that fast. and she talked to boys when she still liked you before she told you so just chill

Il y a une citation qui dit"la beaut du corps dcouronne de celle de l'ame, n'est un ornement que pour les animaux"Tes copines qui disent de toi que tu es moche ne sont pas de vraies amies. En plus ce n'est pas grave si personne ne t'invite  danser ou un truc du genre. Moi on dit de moi que je suis complexe et ?a me fais trop mal au coeur. Tu sais pourquoi on dit de moi que je suis complexe car je m'intresse  mes tudes et je ne m'intresse pas  ce que font les autres ou  ce qu'ils disent de moi. Car le jour o je russirai ma vie et que je serai quelqu'un d'important dans mon pays et que je vivrai bien. Eux ils voudraient tre comme moi. Quand moi j'tudiais,eux ils s'amusaient trop. C'est comme ?a que je pense chaque fois qu'on dit de moi quelque chose de moche. Je crois que tu es une adolescente moi aussi je le suis. C'est vrai que c'est un priode difficile mais c'est aussi la priode pendant la quelle tu vas soit russir ta vie ou bien la ruiner.

Je te jure, ?a marche.  Un exemple, pas plus tard q'uhier soir, gt dans un bar. Je me trouve pas particulierement canon, et en plus de travailler 14 heures par jour, ca fait 6 jours que je dors moins de 5h par nuit et que donc j'ai une tte de dingue. J'ai vu une superbe fille, et sans lui dire un mot, je lui ai fait signe de venir avec le doigt (genre comme dans les films) et elle est venue. Jamais je me serais imagin ?a, jte jure.  Conclusion : si tu ne tentes pas, tu n'auras jamais rien. Ai confiance en toi tout en ne tenant pas compte de ce que tu entends a gauche a droite(faire du sport, ?a aide. Se bourrer la gueule aussi dans certains cas). Et le plus important, faire des choses que personne n'ose faire parceque la meilleure c'est toi et que tous les autres sont des blaireaux. D'ailleurs, les mecs qui veulent pas sortir avec toi sont des moins que rien.

Cette 2ieme personne, c'est vous. Vous ne pouvez savoir  quel point il est facile de remarquer quelqu'un qui manque de confiance en soi et tend  se rabaisser. Selon son tat d'esprit l'attitude adopte est alors de jouer avec cette personne, abuser de sa timidit, la mpriser ou plus gnralement de la ngliger. Vous avez autant de valeur et de droit que n'importe qui. Ne regarder pas les autres d'en bas mais au mme niveau et incorporez vous aux groupes.

Ton but n'est pas de plaire physiquement a tout le monde. Les hommes qui te "calculent pas" quelle importance ?   Un jour, tu sympatiseras avec un homme, et vous aurez beaucoup d'affinits, et tu seras la plus heureuse du monde.    Et crois moi, un couple de gens "moins beaux" que l'archtype tient beaucoup mieux qu'un couple de gens" beaux" qui, finalement, ne font que se tromper et banalisent une relation (car un de plus, un de moins....) , en en perdant le respect pour l'autre.|`|7da0f6da0705aaa18dcb88f0a48c02a3aa	brosse toi bien les dent, et ?a ira bien, tu vas voir  j' attend ta rponse.  fait moi confiance.|`|0cfa2a6ce603b8b8666094dd675e3e2baa	Avec l'age on peux changer la fa?on de se voir et devenir belle (trs subjectif). le regard des gens peux changer|`|4a39300b076f44d2b9aafc404102a6e2aa	JE SERAI CURIEUX DE VOIR A QUOI TU RESSEMBLES.

QsR4VzCSaa	who cares what people are saying about you, they're obviously jealous.. i love when i have haters it means im obviously doing something right.. embrace it, it's better to have people talking about you than having no one even notice|`|4jx4wAhgaa	Probably you did something funny?? But their eyes and their mouth are their property, you can't control it! So, just let it be! I'm sure it will be over pretty soon! =D

It's up to him to come over and talk to you.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	Well if the guy was really interested he should have made a move. But some guys wont. So the next time ur in a similar situation just approach him and start up a conversation.|`|FZMVjKweaa	you should of smiled back its the end o your life now|`|xu0HiYEOaa	you see females stare at me all the time because im a good looking guy.. Rule 1. once you've made eye contact and have a smile that's when you approached them and start a conversation.|`|tg2jyApnaa	Smile back, hold eye contact for a few seconds (the guy will then use the three second rule if he has balls) basically as soon as you make eye contact and you smile he shouldn't wait more the three seconds to start moving towards you.....

I think just like a lot of men they don't want to feel inferior to their partner. it just doesn't feel good.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Yes! Men so are! They want to have complete control over a girl, so if she is successful than he knows you can just up and walk out of the relationship and have somewhere to go, and you may never come back to him. Thats why he is intimidated by you! But that is a really good thing!! Hope this helps.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Maybe Because They Don't Feel Like You Really Need Them.  Guys, Face it!

I would like that actually. And if a guy was intimidated by someone like that its probably because that means you probably actually wanna do a serious relationship, or maybe they might think that they wouldn't be able to support you. Thats not bad, it just means that the type of guys you meet will be really into yo and they're willing to work for you love. Lets talk...
wnyuH0aTaa	Get a requiting kit and get it fixed|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	God unrequited love is such a bit*ch, going through it at the moment and it hurts like hell! My advice is keep away from the person, and keep yourself busy to get your mind off it. Throw yourself into work/school/college/hobby or whatever. And go out with your single friends and have laugh, you never know you may find someone else. But the only best thing for unrequited love is time, in time you will feel better and you WILL get over this person...not matter how much you think you won't at the time. And I know what I'm about to say next won't make you feel any better and I really hate it when people say it you to me, but I'm going to anyway: There are plenty more fish in the sea. I'm a huge believer in if it's meant to be it will. And that everything that happens for a reason, this unrequited love may be a good thing, it could lead to something or someone even better! I know it hurts, but it will get better, just hang it in there hun! Hope this helps and good luck :D x|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	A crush. "What's the best way to deal with a crush?" is what you meant to say.    Act on it. If your feelings aren't reciprocated, move on. You can't make someone love you and it hurts and it sucks trying to work through that rejection, but it's a lesson everyone needs to learn at some point in their life.|`|yQRVxC61aa	well its realy sad to hear.. it depends how serious were u.. n the reason that u got for the love not being requited.. if she is fair enough.. den u need to confront the reality and get over it.. and if she was mean..u need somebdy better, she 's nt worth it or u cn hope dat she wouold repond it in same way.. but dont stick around hte hope part a lot. so i would suggest dont go near her.. or nethng dat reminds of her.its just gonna hurt u... good luck

And if you didn't regret event alittle you wouldn't worry if you were a monster or not..    maybe you should be more careful. I try not to judge people, but its hard when it comes to abortions.. The baby doesn't have a choice in the situation and they didn't ask for you to be careless.. why should they pay for your mistake?     But regardless.. Its your choice.  I believe its wrong but that's my choice.    If i was in your position, or the Girls position i would have the baby and if i couldn't care for it i would give it to a family that would love and care for it and give it everything that i was ill equipped to give it.|`|QH9Xihz4aa	Ever heard of condoms?

But if you didn't need an abortion you shouldn't have done it.. Also if you don't want a baby get protection. Even if the baby hasn't experienced life yet and doesn't really know anything that's still killing something... But you aren't a monster. Although I am against abortion, I think it can be necessary if you tried your best not to have one, and still ended up with it. Or it was some stupid teenager who didn't get on the pill with someone boyfriend who doesn't know how to put on a condom. :||`|7lkclHF0aa	No not right!!! It's like killing something that's part of you!!! But you sound like a player And that kinda turns me on|`|fFRD3o22aa	It sounds like you are irresponsible and that you have no compassion whatsoever. That baby never got a choice to live you took it from them. Think about all the friends you would have made that youll never know because they were aborted. Or all of the scientists who could have found a cure for cancer but they were aborted. What if Mary aborted Jesus because he wasnt conceived by Joseph?Abortions should not be "normalities" of today or simple tolerated.|`|EBZh03PZaa	No I would not say that u are a monster.

It is just better when u dont make the same mistake over & over again...abortions can have irreversable damage on your body too.|`|AA12266367	You're not a monster. You're irresponsible. What usually happens when people in general have sex? It often produces a baby. If you're not man enough to take on responsibilities then you shouldn't even participate in that activity. It's so stupid to kill something that had nothing to do w/ your bad decisions.     Its like going fishing in a swamp. You know that no fish are there but there you are. When you get a boot instead of a fish you go home and shoot your mailman. Mailman didn't even know what happened, wasn't bringing you bills or anything bad like that and you shot him. That's how stupid that is.     Plus you said you only live life once and that fullest stuff. Congratulations you stole that opportunity from 3 people so you can just kill more and keep your "fun".

TXSn9VwAaa	sorry but no one can really tell you what to do, this is one of those problems where you just have to follow your heart and do what you think you should do. you could wait a little while and see what happens or you could talk to your friends or even just talk to him about his friends and tell him why you don't like them but don't tell him that he has to stop hanging out with them for you to continue to go out with him. good luck!|`|wVXXPRmZaa	Kiss him!!! Live your life or you'll regret it!    Have fun girl!|`|GqFNl3rzaa	If your attitude is like this towards kissing than hun you sound wayy to young to be doing all this and instead of dumping him and breaking his heart just tell him straight up thats what i would do if i was you|`|qajX3kzPaa	... you want to dump your BOYFRIEND because he wants a kiss AFTER 4 monthss :S    the first time my boyfriend and I kissed we weren't even dating|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	lol theres nothing wrong with kissing lmao your overreacting honey. go for it, dont worry about it so much just have fun|`|zMCpXmivaa	why wouldn't u kiss ur bf? he likes u, and just wants to show it. and dont break up with him because of his friends, it's not his fault that they act that way, unless he's making jokes about u too, which i doubt.   u probably just have cold feet about the whole kissing issue.|`|r7tllHjuaa	Kiss him.  Heehee.  Ignore his friends --|`|zKEVdGv2aa	There is nothing wrong with kissing, but if you don't want to and he is pressuring you then it would be best to not do it. And if his friends are really that mean then I would reconsider the relationship's potential, you don't want to be around people like that indefinitely.|`|gNNbTP8Oaa	So what if they're jerks. All the friends of the boys you meet will probably big big jerks to you too. My friends are exactly like that...It can't be helped. It's fun to piss off ur friends
lRemKlvOaa	it doesnt matter as long as they arent chapped lips, but flavored lip gloss is fine just not to much|`|oidfmtnYaa	poop!|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	If there is any feeling behind the kiss, then it really doesn't much matter what is on her lips within reason.|`|5xwPRvVOaa	I want nothing, just her sheer delight that I kiss her, and she kisses me back.|`|xmK56dIXaa	Idk, I always find it kind of funny when I get home and realize I have some sort of fruit lip gloss on my lips. :)|`|joA5Rcyzaa	i dont like anything on the lips, if they put stuff on them it feels all greesy and nasty    yuck|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Lip gloss, sometimes chapstick feels a little too thick.  Any lip gloss is good, but sometimes the strong mint ones are pretty bad.
9w8EW24daa	talk about things he is interested in and listen to him and not talk as much maybe|`|Ly20pGC9aa	im in the same delema,   get a new guy in the mean time.  he thinks he has you wrapped around   his finger, show him that he dosent,  then he'll be like hey woah why isnt  she all over me anymore?    itll make him jeleous.  and it will catch his eye|`|40qTdKuPaa	Try and ask him what he wants from you. If he is getting bored with you there must be something he needs/wants from you. So just ask him, its the only way to get to know what you want to know. Hope this helps.|`|p4XrCUTAaa	ask that dude out
smFfcmYuaa	That kind of miscommunication occurs frequently in that kind of setting. I'm not sure whether the guy was trying to show off to you or not but if he kept sort of hanging around then it's likely he was interested in you.     My advice is that the next time you see him around start talking with him and come up with some excuse like the music is too loud to go to some other quieter place like a cafe to try and get to know him. Relationships are mostly hanging around with people eating and talking so if that blows then the whole thing will blow and you can move on.    By the way I realize that it can be a bit hard at times to be proactive and outgoing in that kind of situation, but you just have to be assertive with people about what you want and don't want or you'll end out with crappy nights like that one talking to a guy you're not interested in while the other one gets away.    Good luck.|`|YFgREceaaa	nobody cares..ima go back to playing my game|`|p1bpXfb5aa	>>what the frig is all this crap to read  you think we all have time for this|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	wow, you werent kidding when you said that was the longest question ever...! haha       first off, i know this isnt what you want to hear, but your friends are probably right. who knows where the guy came from -- hell, you dont even know his name! i will say, though, that if it's meant to be, you will bump into him some other time. try going back to the same club again on another night and maybe he will be there looking for you :)       if you dont ever see him again, it's probably a sign for you to move on and find someone as equally drool-worthy (haha). just give it some time and let things fall into place. good luck|`|hPDQGtdJaa	well first id start by saying that this question is long but i have time, so i read it. and id say that chances are that u WILL see him again. so dont freak out, ull have a second chance to take ur move. and yeah i do think he was tryin to grab ur attention, but hey ull see him again so dont worry bout it ull get ur chance, and if u dont theres ,more fish in the sea right? thers gotta be that one fish that will love u :)|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	If you ever see him again start to talk to him and carry on a conversation, flirt, but act hard to get like your not interested. Be careful, make a slight move to make sure you have his eyes on you, but don't make it obvious that you like him. Play it cool. Good luck.|`|LAcH71Ooaa	HAHAHAHA that was so long its actually kinda funny. ya he was DEF showin off to u. i got a little lost @ parts but i would def make a move nxt time u c tattoo guy. hes probs into u too. hahaha...still laughin ovr the length of ur question...|`|Xr4taSb4aa	well next time avoid talking to other men u don't know and of he talkked to u don't be mean and let him do the talk and gd luck with himmm|`|plJ4GFSOaa	Actually...your question was pretty short. Your explanation is quite lengthy, though.    I would suggest this. Use your previous engagement with him as a bit of a stage for the next time you see him. Try getting his attention and showing that you're a little interested, and if he questions how you felt last time you met, try to joke around with him a little and tell him that your last encounter was on a bad or an inappropriate evening or something, so that he doesn't feel thwarted.     Hopefully, you'll meet him at the same club, and the suggestion of interest won't seem as awkward as it would be anywhere else.     Just, be sure to talk to him! Make an effort to show that you're interested. If you love his tattoos, make sure he knows it! If you think he's funny or cute, make sure he knows it!     Don't be too overly shy. He's not shy, so why should you be?     Best of luck, and hope I helped at least a little.    Kat|`|TlSUvZ4Yaa	Well that was alot but I would say that you should just go up to him! Good luck!!|`|Rna9NqXhaa	So,wow,lonnng story to get to the point.  but just act cool and flirt,comment on his tats,be friendlyy =)  Its easy,  so what if you made a mistake  obviously he didnt care cause he was trying to get his attentoin.  or maybe show off something on front of him.not like that,it sounds bad.but if you have a tat,idk.  Just be nice =P|`|rfvdeF9Vaa	The next time you see him, most likely at a club I'm guessing, see if he notices you again, if he does, then maybe he does have the hots for you, if he doesn't, maybe he just wanted to get laid that night. It seems to me though that night you seem to be a good observer, I'm surprised you couldn't figure him out yourself.|`|QuEU8Mh2aa	just make a stupid joke about seeing eachother everywherelike " fancy seeing you hear" OR " you show up everywhere these days" or even " are you following me :) ;)"( but that one has to be really flirty not serious. Try it !:)|`|Am8D2ggiaa	Wow that sounded like my girlfriends friend O.o  oh well.. well you should just go up to him and say hi or something!  i mean really come on... but still like *silences* i dunno...  uugh.. my head hurts ...|`|LDLTjNCraa	Smile and say Hi, and ask him if he's alright or something.|`|KcloaW4vaa	TALK TO HIM. My god, ur being completely shy about it and just need to talk. Just get into a conversation with and him and hit it off. It sounds like he likes u so it should be a bit easy to talk to him because he will want to. Enjoy!|`|XoYHF1RLaa	TOO LONG TO READ.|`|7tLDdtqGaa	you should ignore him.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Just nonchalantly approach him next time you see him, and say something ordinary like " i've see you in here a few times" to spark the conversation, if he isn't interested in your, or a nervous little *****, then he will probably give a one word, boring answer. Or if he sees something in you he will probably try to continue the conversation. Good luck :)

643ee1269def6ad84a2ad8450e860581aa	You are a wonderful person for caring about him, but he will not stop drinking until he admits that drinking is a problem for him.  He will be angry when others try to tell him how bad his drinking is.  He will deny that it is out of control.  He will never stop until he finally faces his own alcoholism.    You and your family should attend some Al-anon meetings.  These meetings will teach you about alcoholism and what you can do to try and help your uncle.

You have to watch alcoholics and not let them drag you down  with them.  They are masters at using family and friends to blame for actions which are their own fauts.  Try to get him in church. Sometimes this works and sometimes  they abuse the membership who try to  help them.  Just b ehonest with him and tell him you all care but he is diggin h his own grave and if he doesn't want to help himself to get out of yur lives and move as yuo don't  want to see him punish himself any longer and you have no intention of becoming a part of his nightmare he created.  He can only accept treatment so far and will have ot take steps to clean his own life up. Family shosuld come before a bottle of alcohol.

Until you truly gets more committed, and serious about your personal relationships, don't ask her. Just be friends.|`|J2uxLxDPaa	well, I hope it works out, remember she's cool so just try it out, if it doesn't that's why in breakup lines, they ask if they can just stay friends.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	It's a really tough choice. If you go for it, then you best be willing to loose her as a friend, in case things don't go well (most likely unless u get marry). Point is, a tough choice always has some serious consequence or you sacrifice something else. Weigh out those decisions and feel it out until you are sure about this, because it can't be undone.
EDJ8heifaa	Because shallow girls, like all shallow people, are ignorant.  They don't have the ability or are too lazy to actually look at situations or people in depth.  They put themselves before anyone else and are usually quite selfish.      You're right, shallow people can be loveable and give love in return, but to what extent?      In the long run a relationship with a shallow person will probably not last because of their inability to see things in depth and their selfishness.  They can only provide so much "true" love for a person other than themselves.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Shallow girls make a great match for Shallow guys. Everyone is meant for someone. I guess in the long run they get too boring and for people like me id like someone to crack a joke from time to time.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	shallow girls and shallow guys are the same  they only wanted to be with you because u looked sexy so you always have to look that way if you gain weight its over|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	It's the long run that matters - you want someone who can love you and respect you on a deep, emotional level. Someone who's with you for your looks or money cant give you that.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	You just have to watch yourself. If they really are shallow, you have to figure out why they really like you?    Shallowness is not always a bad thing though, at least you know they think you are gorgeous...|`|zFb022Iiaa	It's ok to fall for shallow girls.  Just don't think that you will have a deep and lasting love (oops, ha).  It can't last without something to hang on to.|`|ScHW4842aa	Shallow girls are into fashion, money and gossip. They do not understand about a deep relationship. Only 'oh look, how cute, he bought me a teddy bear!'  kind of thing is what they care about. They do not ponder deeply about you on the inside. Only your social status ('popularity') and looks.     For instance - i am not a shallow girl. I am Australian, for a start. Our outlook on life is a lot more down to earth than americans... we dont party all that much and are more laid back. A lot more importance is placed on getting educated and then getting a good job, and then married with children.     I am newly married. My husband is constantly thinking about money, work and etc. It is hard. What shallow girl would value her partner and see through that, accepting that it is his choice to be that way and her choice to still love him?  Life is not all shoes, party, glamor and gossip.     If you want to be happy, i suggest you find a smart girl - one with a university degree, who has morals and who would make a good loyal wife and a brilliant caring mother.     You cannot imagine the importance of those things!|`|dQCZDAqgaa	nothing wrong as long as you know she is shallow.|`|0RstDjygaa	its not if you like her there should be no problem|`|cG7z70Vgaa	Don't worry about what other people think and stick to your personal opinions and beliefs.|`|nSdYPN8Raa	in the long run shallow girls are the most likely to hurt you badly  but if you dont think shes shallow then you dont have to listen to those other people... i say listen to yourself and what your heart and mind are telling you to do. bcause to be honest nothing good ever comes out of listening to other people, just rumors and gossip.   good luck =) hope this helps|`|VrR9ojRRaa	There's nothing wrong with loving a shallow girl.    Everyone has flaws, sometimes a girls flaw is to be shallow. That doesnt make them less loveable.|`|AA10858784	Labeling are for cans so let's try to leave it for the cans ;)    Don't worry too much on what other people say. Every girl is unique, just like how every guy is unique. Take your time to find out the qualities you like in a girl. The best way to learn is to step in to the field.|`|oUxEhbkkaa	I dont think there is really such thing as a shallow girl because i dont really like thinking bad of other people but shallow girls only love you for the fact that you love them so they really don't love you for youjust that you love them. Im nt trying to think bad of anyone but just for a statement of fact.|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	Shallow girls don't really love you. They just love the fact that you love them.|`|2e6BEZ30aa	personal preference?|`|ADDzZeEHaa	beacause if there shallow all they will like is your looks, money, cars and sex...    hello??  but if your ok with that then go for it|`|6FzQEempaa	what does shallow mean??|`|nzCxfFNyaa	huh?|`|YCmveH6laa	shallow? i odnt understand?|`|mnwN4QuRaa	I would be worried about why they care for me if they are truly shallow.|`|srfZDygNaa	there's just not much depth in their personality.   if you ever want to hold up an intellectual conversation, try starting one with a "shallow girl" and you will answer your own question|`|fsHgUrcAaa	When the shallow girl meets someone better she will leave you for him.|`|SjEa1tRfaa	For me, its just a matter of whether she really likes me or just likes flirting with me.|`|iiPU4diyaa	Possibilities are you can get AIDS from her. lol. but seriously    But if you really love her, why not?  Just make sure that your points that make you think you "love" her are strong enough.  -jen|`|HdvMYsLwaa	shallow girls just want attention..they arent going to love you for you they will always be looking for attention and worry about themselves..dont try to change her but hint to her how you feel..good luck!|`|cIuM4BPyaa	it aint wrong to love who you love no matter what nobody think so if somebody say something be like i dont care i love her. but i dont why people like shallow girls i have one theory sometimes its because they really probably not shallow in your eyes nd you see the real them or maybe you just like snobby or fak girls but to me it dont matter and another reason could bethe reason like her is the way she act.|`|Kp5WDalRaa	You are right, they do love. The thing is that "shallow" is usually used to describe someone who likes you for your looks, money, popularity and so on. They usually leave whoever their with when somebody better comes along. Most people don't like to be with someone with this kind of personality, but if it doesn't bother you, then go for the shallow girl. Maybe you can change everyone else's mind about her.|`|2NLF7KwZaa	dunno if its true bud but they reckon that coz their shallow they could easily cheat as its not love they want but lust,  And people reckon that they need sex and not love and that is what they want,   however this is not necessarily  true but its what people tend to think.|`|7Ls7GbWzaa	fall in love with who you like...it'll end in disaster at some point anyhow!|`|vOlGhIVTaa	dude just do wat ever the hell you want|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	If you are good enough for a shallow girl to fall for you, then you must be pretty awesome! Shallow girls are fun, so just roll with it.... but dont take it too seriously....|`|fqknl88Baa	Because they will be way too fixated on themselves while your trying to talk to them.|`|mtAez1v4aa	Well, shallow girls are desperate and just want a boyfriend. They pretend to love you. Are you rich? Then they're just into you for the money they really don't love you. They're just using you. Stay away, and find a new girl.|`|t8VEswrmaa	shallow girls dont exactly love you back thats why there shallow and before you call a girl shallow try getting to know her better maybe the girl you like who is shallow (if you do like a girl) isnt really shallow your friends just think she is and also girls change from when theyre flirting with a guy then actually going out with the guy. so she might be kinda shallow now but later she might not be. sorry us girls are complicated! :D|`|JqzFzavCaa	I think you should follow your heart. She is shallow for a reason, she is just using that to make her feel better and you give her a chance you will get that side of her you always knew was there.
De6n2MaIaa	bah, why aren't there more guys like you? >    i'm an extremely shy girl, and it sucks. you want to be sparky and confident but you're too afraid of embarassing yourself. so when a guy takes the time to give you attention it feels pretty awesome. give her attention but don't frighten her away.    so catch her when she's on her own. not with your mates or she'll think you're winding her up and just showing off in front of them. talk to her. the book you saw her reading and is it any good, or how you like the way she's done her hair today, anything. ask her questions (something more than 'what's up?'), and don't talk about yourself too much or show off. asking her about -her- shows you're interested in what she has to say.    and i'd advise you not to rush. just talk to her that first time, don't ask her out in five minutes. give her time to think over the conversation once you've left. if she doesn't approach you in the meantime go back and talk the next day, and gradually talk to her more often until it becomes a regular chat and take it from there.    mmkay. that was probably too much. but good luck anyway.  [:|`|vHwYENVjaa	send me a picture because you just may be my soul mate.      but anyway, approach them in a manner where it doesn't look like you are approaching them just for "fun" or as a joke, if you're as attractive as you claim to be.    show interest in them that is genuine and that will erase their fears that you are bad or shallow.|`|Yn3OOdP3aa	haha i'm really really shy   and sometimes when a guy like you comes up to me i think your like jokeing around or something, or just being dumb. idk lol|`|DGorWR1raa	Well, I'm a shy girl too. And It just matters how you try to approach her. If its like you just walk up to her and its like Hey. I know I get a tad bit uncomfortable, but if its someone who knows your friends, and you see her talking to your friends, just talk to her. And if they think your into the whole sex & party stuff, then they aren't the right one for you. Don't find a girl who is judgmental. And if your a totally hot guy, the shy ones are going to be like wait, why are you talking to ME. And question themselves a lot like a guy like him wouldn't like me, hes too popular and too mucch of a bad boy, so if theres a certain girl your going after just give her a lot of hints that you like her. Or shes going to keep thinking that. And do something sweet, or she might think you just wanna get in her pants. I have the same problem except I dunno how to approach quiet guys. Haha.

I suggest you wait a loong time because it wouldnt be right for a 16 year old and 13 year old to go out.|`|99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	Of course not!  Age is measured not in years but in experience and maturity.    Don't miss out on opportunities of life for trivial reasons.

If no guy come up to you, then you walk to them.|`|x57o6wOoaa	Guys probably do like you all you have to do is be yourself....and what are you even worried about you sound like you could be a model!....and its only been a year so wait wait!!
tC0bxF2daa	Most Awkward for me..   It would have to be been when this girl that sat next to me in art class and I starting a pleasant conversation we were laughing and having fun and out of nowhere she started talking about her intimate fantasies.. I was and am still shy about discussing such topics in public and I turned bright red.. and was dumbstruck for the rest of class and just stayed quite. and on top of that I she kept rubbing her foot on my leg for the rest of the semester and I was too shy to do anything but ignore it.(plus the fact I knew she had a boyfriend, this took place at Community College last year.)

Sb9Nvvu1aa	Part of the fun of life is to figure it out.  If she and her b/f are ready to make out, then she doesn't need to learn to do it before hand.  She just needs to do what comes natural and not feel ashamed to talk about it with her b/f.  If she can be honest and keep the communication open with him.  They'll figure out what works best for them.  Sucking or not sucking, good or not good, changes alot between different couples.    Just reassure her - she'll be fine!

And sure.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	She looks like fun and I'd say around 18 or 19.|`|9LbTioS0aa	ya   she seems like a fun person  i would guess 16|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	sure why not? she look around 17.  can i have her email?|`|mzkfSwLwaa	She looks about 17-19. I'm married and in love so no i wont go out with her!|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	She looks pretty good, ya.|`|JaXIaOn1aa	I would consider it, she looks around 20|`|cR3M6tepaa	she looks like shes between 17-21 and no thank u|`|LkRivHpTaa	i definatly would she looks about 23|`|9fLLn2PFaa	Oh yeah she's good looking at doesn;t seem to take herself so seriously.  Sense of humor is a plus.|`|X88lyKHoaa	Im obviously a girl.  shes pretty.  I'd say maybe hmm between 16-18 years old?  ha.|`|4T7L1S7Vaa	She looks about 14, but she is a very pretty girl!!!|`|pgAcX782aa	she looks lik 18 or less|`|3z0ROQvCaa	she look around 17 or 18....and I think shes pretty, I would date her.|`|rjsqd7jNaa	i would in a flash! lol shes really hot! =)    would she go out with me? myspace.com/careforsomesoup
tC0bxF2daa	You could write a note and slide it across to her, if she's not interested she will most likely brush it aside, but if she is you will have her attention. =)
jqhvxWzGaa	lol - this is going to happen all the time, starting now, and ending ... well, probably never.    i think the best way to handle it is go after what you want, but never say anything negative about your friend. if she can't handle it, it might break the friendship, but she'll have to deal with it again with any new friend she makes. it will probably make your friendship stronger.|`|7tWuuSn0aa	go for it and forget about your friend because the same thing happened to me and my friend and she went for the guy behind my back...so i now say first come, first serve lol
cG7z70Vgaa	I think he just want more. Try talking to him about it.|`|53sVKcOeaa	Thats strange but just move in and take it from him lol, just keep him happy, if he is any kind of lover he will be trying to please you not himself.
3mQPQen5aa	Why don't you give him candy instead?
Ir51Eb0Kaa	Yes.|`|3mQPQen5aa	If you're the only one he flirts with, he does.|`|7tWuuSn0aa	yes definitely...how exciting :)|`|QJMC2Q6Naa	Ok................. Either that or he is special  Yeeeeeeeeessssssssss
w3tNq8npaa	Yes.If this ever happens again and if anyone ever lays a hand on you,you call the cops.Abuse of any kind is never okay.
iwvRBeXOaa	Why keep fighting to keep getting together? You keep breaking up for a reason, it's time for you to accept that it's pretty much over otherwise you two would be working through the issues instead of turning to breaking up.    Chances are if he's really serious about it this time he's been over it for a while which is why it seems easier for him to move on. Sometimes you just have to let go. You can't fight for someone when they've already told themselves they are over it, you just have to have respect for yourself and move on as well.|`|vIr0Y0EVaa	Don't beg, that's the worst thing to do. You'll just have to see what happens. I'm sorry, but that's how life is.
XujAun13aa	i would start bringing him around more so that they get to know him so they can judge him for him and not for whatever his family has done to get their bad rep.  explain to them why he is different and how much you feel for him and maybe they'll change their minds.  but if they don't, i would just stay with him if that's what you want to do.  you shouldn't live to please other people.|`|LWwGW48Daa	They are concerned for you. If his family has a bad rep then they are worried about how he is going to treat you!
KIWBMbI6aa	get him a whip handcuffs and a man thong|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	ha.   3 weeks and 2 days..  thats not enuff time to give him something sexy..  you might freak him out a bit, itd freak me out|`|47eaf46122c4f549d5ee0bdf2f43622eaa	hopefully you are over twenty one or this won't work.  Buy him beer.  and say Beerready tonight.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Dress up! Boys like when you can dress up for him in a sexy outfit! i heard that i ******* is the best gift a girl can give a guy!!! hope this helps|`|AA11795191	How old are you again?    Get him some candy or something, sheesh.|`|5hHMIuV5aa	you should learn to fire bananas out your vagoo|`|aGrU7s2Qaa	adameve.com has some good stuff|`|HresywF6aa	get a tub of crisco
sJTPzFdlaa	Confidence and taking care of yourself. And of course, making him feel that you want him. Guys love an ego trip.
H5669mexaa	Its totally normal to be shy around someone you like..  because you hold this person in a different regard than you do everyone else.. you actually care if this person likes you back..  So, its basically a level of confidence that may shy away... its not completely known for sure why we do this, I still sometimes do it myself..  However, just be yourself..  shy an all if that is what happens!|`|6L8AFxwdaa	it is completely normal. a crush usually sees the part of you that you really don't want anyone to see, aka the shy part :P|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Yes it's very normal.|`|tvwmiDwRaa	well yeah when you like someone alot you get nervous i would know im in 8th grade!
1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	I don't think it is his business since it has only been 6 mos.  Your credit situation might improve by the time things get more serious.  Hopefully he does know about the fibromyalgia, because while credit issues may be temporary, fibromyalgia is permanent.  That could mean more bills in the future as well as illness.  If he already knows about the illness, you may want to mention one day how you are glad that you are not having episodes right now, how much debt it put you in, how much you've paid off, etc.    The important thing is that he loves you no matter what.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	show him how you have responibly paid it off---and the score will increaseiin time---the only big concern shoul dbe if you want to buy  ahouse--    otherwise he can continue to only have new credit (car, etc.) in his name only    until you are considering joint expenses at all (even moving in together)--it shouldn't be a problem--just don't open any joint accounts unless he is fully informed|`|pZevjTXGaa	I think you should tell him the truth, he'll understand.|`|ChwJWjQSaa	tell him the truth. if he is the one for you, he will understand.
pQGUPITeaa	Yes, and it felt like crap.    But you know what? I don't even like that guy any more, except as a friend. He was right to reject me - it would NEVER have worked out.|`|ydCoPRkRaa	twice. it sucks|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Yes but in the long run it was good because he was a tool!|`|SFFTnmsXaa	ohh yess...it happens all the time lmao i just move on|`|o2J1RbnVaa	Yeah i hae. But no one knows that, and i moved on. It was really hard and i knew that he likes my best friend... It was really painfully but i tried really hard and now i moved on....  If its hard for you to move on, you should try different things, like change you style, change you like, start doing something good that you haven't done before.... It helps)|`|ELzYeHUsaa	Nope...I don't ask ppl out they ask me...and  I've had 7 boyfriends most LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNN... lasting and like 5 of them I liked and they liked me back. p.s. don't give me crap about how many boyfriends I've had...It's not alot and it not to little cuz I'm not a whore or a weirdo that can't get one...Lol|`|tAQOcfA8aa	nope!|`|pZevjTXGaa	yep, it hurts, it kinda makes you feel like a fool.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	no...so can't really help with this one..|`|15fG5yX7aa	yes it hurt in the begging but than i was like i need to move on and i did :)|`|c816Ebkvaa	Yes.  I felt like I wanted to crawl under my bed and never come out. But that was just at first. After a few days, I was fine. Still hurting a little when I saw him, but fine.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Oh yes! I had a F buddy, but to me he was soooooo much more, and i almost loved him! and he didnt like me like that,. he just wanted to use me! It made me feel like i wasnt worth anything, and that i needed to do something to be better. I was just torn, and im still not over him or the situation.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I have been and it does suck.  I felt really lousy and wondered why they didn't like me back...but now that I'm a little older, I've come to realize that it's really not that big of a deal..someone more compatible will come along.|`|oOEaudwvaa	yea i have but i got over it fast cause someone else ended up having a crush on me but I kinda wanted to know why they didn't like me back but then again I didn't because it could be a very hurtful reason|`|Pt9SRn6Jaa	yes i have and i felt heartbroken. it completely sucked!|`|dIZNGzneaa	yeah|`|Y6YGHsKjaa	Yeah. But I didn't feel that bad. I had realized by then that he wasn't right for me.|`|ZPkKk5Rmaa	Well , i didn't ,  but my best friend did !  She cried|`|cdsfJ5YFaa	I have in middle school, It my feelings, I was crushed a little, but now that Im grown out the house and with a career, I know whats important in life.|`|uEDDlofhaa	yes, made me feel like crap! sucks hearts are a fragile thing!|`|2GPCuuYRaa	Multiple times by the same guy.  that he was being pretty harsh and i wasnt good enough for him.|`|71RMmp2Kaa	yes. i have, and i felt terrible, but i moved on, because if your not worth their time, their not worth your.|`|0lpx78d7aa	YES! It feels like someone has just punched you hard in the stomach, and reached into your chest and ripped your heart out!|`|VTjevIEHaa	it friggin sucks. bt don't let tht ruin yer confidence..their nt worth it :/|`|wQcYAmY5aa	No, I know how to get what i want.|`|GNGw5MItaa	3 times, the first one was by far the worst... after that it got easier to handle...|`|yZImAkozaa	yeah everyone has-- if they say they haven't, they're probably lying.|`|bhshBoG5aa	Yes, and it hurts bad but after a year you'll get over it don't stress about it.|`|KO6r1dbSaa	Well the best way to never burden yourself with the guilt of denial and pain, is you should always keep your confidence and let nature take it's course. One shouldn't (in my opinion) directly approach to anyone and should observe if both your and his/her feelings coincides with one another. This particularly will result in a better outcome while "nature" will evidently take its course. Remember feelings don't respond logically, rather chemically.
ZPHB8TeAaa	For the third date take them to a cute little dinner. Not to fancy its only the third date. But don't take them to a cheap place to eat.|`|LLnNjH94aa	Go to the cemetery from 7-9 one night this week.  Take a lot of Gogurt and fruit snacks.  Tell her that it's a 'spiritual adventure.'|`|3D1w7eCjaa	try going to see a play
IOVDAwmnaa	your first mistake started when you snuck him the note instead of handing it to him or talking to him, but thats ok. time for damage control!  you need to go up to him (at a good time when he isn't w/ his friends and you aren't w/ urs!) and approach the subject. if he says no, its his loss. if he says yes, SCORE!!!    but the point is, you shouldn't let this come between you. you need to let him know you want to stay friends, no matter how embarrassing or awkward. time will make those feelings fade (and i don't mean years--more like days, child).|`|7mQNq9ceaa	should have just talked to him|`|KlBn8R5Gaa	he's shy now.    it sounds like he likes you and HE's the one who doesn't know what to say    so my advicw would be to talk to him.  just casual you know    say whats up?    or something like that  he won't want to be rude and he'll like your courage|`|cXWFTLgKaa	i would go up to him and just ask him maybe he never found the note or maybe he is to shy to come up to you .. and if worst comes to worst if he rejects you ..you can get over him faster lol i hope i helped !! good luck!!|`|2uLD1AI6aa	I would ask him if his friend gave him the letter to start up a conversation. If he say "no" ask him to his face, if you have the guts or you could just say with a cute smile "I'll write you another one". If he say's "yes" then he should give you an answer unless he's too scared to be a man and let you know how he really feels. You don't want a guy like that anyway. But just check if he got the letter first. Good luck I hope I hope you have a great time at the KOH!|`|ooHqdfPEaa	Hon... he never found the note. Its still in the bottom of his backpack. Or the friend you gave it to loves you and doesn't want you two to go together and is hoping he is your second choice. Answer mine?|`|i156RD10aa	Well, you already did the hard part by giving him the note. If he hasn't approached you yet, it's probably because he doesn't know how to or what to say. I think you should come up to him and talk to him. Then casually mention the dance and ask him about it. If he keeps staring, then he's obviously interested. Good luck!|`|8O4ttgGMaa	go to him. give him a couple days. then go up to him and say "hey, I was wondering if you got my note?" and then go from there|`|ac0rRBHCaa	tell him you like him ask him if he likes you try and be cool while you do it be straight forward|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	well try and bring up the subject around him, ask if he got your note, and if he says yes, then say something like "well...?" or "so, what do you think?" Make him give you an answer! :) good luck|`|xCAbKKIOaa	hmm this is a toughie hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...                 ok so just tell ask him if he got the note if he says yes then say do you have an answer or something like that hmmmmm  thats all i got|`|AA11593592	just confront him.  give him a call.|`|xtcSsPPwaa	talk to him!|`|aN1oaCStaa	You gave him a note, and you say mega hottie?  Oh no.     In the words of Gandalf the Gray "Run you fools".|`|IK925thzaa	His staring is a sign that he wants to get it on|`|yfwSDroNaa	just go back and talk to him like normal...the subject will come about  chiiill! lol|`|1cL06jyTaa	the fact that your name is   rodeo baybay  makes it extremely hard to take you seriously|`|BUlLOqjeaa	I would just ask him: "did u get my note?" Just say that you wanted to know his answer so you can ask someone else if not!  That will get his attention.  If he declines don't ever bother w/ him again.  Good luck!!
fHHeal1Vaa	i miss the time when I didnt know you existed, but I am sure the happiness after you depart will be better than anything else I have ever imagined.even the ugliest person will be beuatiful when compared to you, even the hardest times will be easy when compared with days of you forcing yourself onto me you ugly pervreted old man
4f752e2d3f5f42ca67188c6c79a7a283aa	yeh he likes you!!!!! he asked you who you like cuase he wanted to see if u would say him u shouldve said u so u guys could go out...
xnmkrhLMaa	sounds like more than friends to me. before me and my current boyfriend were together we were bestfriends. and we didnt admit to ourselves that we were in love with eachother. we had a sleepover with a bunch of friends and we fell asleep cuddling together. everyone knew we liked eachother except we didnt admit it to anyone not even ourselves. maybe you guys havent admitted that you like eachother? maybe you guys are in denial|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	Sounds like more than just friends to me lol...|`|iZV86fq6aa	id consider you guys close friends with "benefits." ...otherwise you two should start going out :D|`|1J8UiJXWaa	I think its something else
173vsiacaa	why ever not? sounds sweet.|`|HunSyQaSaa	perfect|`|Gorf5EgYaa	Well I would say no, but it depends on what happened. If your brother can feel a real deep connection between him and her then yes he should bring A flower. But at that note not a rose or anything else but like a simple daisy but something sweet and innocent looking. A rose might seem like he's being a bit pushy
2rPgdl4iaa	ya shes totally flirting. but dont call her out on it.....she might get defensive.|`|naySyzfQaa	Have you asked her...jokingly. She may tell you truthfully.|`|Rc5wpzSiaa	100% likes you, but if that's her personality see how she acts with other guys but sounds to me she likes you|`|AA10934463	sometimes ,just ask her or ask her out of something then youll kno the answer she might just be pulling oyur chain or be a good flirt and she doesnt give anything back in return.|`|oPrMQkJQaa	yeah she is flirting with u so i think she likes u|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	SHE LIKES YOU!! Geez, whats does a girl gotta do?
8gDRQ7v2aa	You know when you feel that way. A guy that really loves you should make you happy and should make you feel like a queen.
UR0kWdQdaa	Start talking to him again to see if he still even talks to you. Then if he does, maybe you'll start talking often. Then hint to him that you like him by flirting and stuff. He'll realize you like him, and if he likes you then maybe he'll go after you. Or you could straight up tell him, explaining how much he means to you and how much you like him. Just don't do anything to scare him. Haha. I've done that, doesn't work out too good. Lol. But if you want him back; you best make your move! :)  Good luck!!  Hope this helped!|`|zB5EftV8aa	hahaha, classic!
jeHTjvbaaa	Um.. well personally and I know I am not alone by far with this, but I find it pretty hot to watch two hot girls together... I am only assuming it's the same with girls?  Why would her watching two GUYS have sex maker her a lesbian?  Did I miss something?
B92xHBDKaa	A Disney theme could be fun. Like Alice in Wonderland, maybe. Or another movie as a theme could be fun.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Do heaven and hell, thats cool. Or China themed, or Fantasy (like faries and stuff) and dress up like halloweenish|`|J30Gh5O6aa	you should do like winter wonderland.|`|Fsu8u4aiaa	Maybe a Country/Western theme-boots,bandannas, overalls?|`|UkEVj2f1aa	Casa Blanca??    and you could go to this website they have a lot of ideas    http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/s...|`|BV7IatgYaa	Circus  Jungle  Like a 50's theme would be cool too :)|`|W1gzD1sAaa	depends when you're having it.  you could do a winter wonderland if its in the winter  or you could do a color theme.  movies are always a good idea too.  I had mine on halloween and it was masquerade.  try looking at prom books and websites for other ideas.
UZ2nix6xaa	Find out what he likes and look into it a bit.... when you talk to him bring it up into conversation and he'll think you're cool, and build your relationship up from there - you might also want to find out what sort of girl he wants and see if you're that sort of girl (if you're not then don't push yourself to be... it just means you'll have to work a little harder).    In most cases a guy will like to be noticed, and likes to feel as though people care about him so ask him how he is, how his day was, or if he looks a bit down if everything's alright.    I hope this helps.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	be yourself. that's all you can do don't be fake and not you...that's not a good thing.|`|C3tVKFWuaa	I have asked some of my own friends. They all said just to be yourself.  Which i think is great but you want to go out with a guy, so you need to Flirt. Try Seating next to him every period. Ask him fo rhelp when you really don't even need it. And try to look "hot" all you got to do is mostly be your self around him, while being in Control!    I hope i helped!|`|0cBEbHlHaa	1.dress nice  2.have good hair  3.gud luck

The best thing to do is to tell her how you feel and you dont want to hurt her but the best thing to do right now is be apart cause things changed. give her closure cause if not shell never be able to move on or anything. i never got closure so it took me a while. but either way you do it her heart is going to break but better do it now than later when its much more into your relationship and it hurts even more. The more you wait the harder itll get. but make sure that is what you want to do before you do it....hope i helped!!
AA12108398	do not ignore him. talk to your friend, who he likes, and ask for her insight. it seems stupid but it will help. you also should talk to him and tell him your feelings and you don't want it to be awkward and you value his friendship. if you need anyone to talk to or share your lyrics with please visit my website frighteningtruth.webs.com/  i also express myself in musical ways.|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	stop trying to attract him. you are undergoing emotional responses  to him but it is clear he will never be more than a friend to you now. unless you move on by getting busy, stop dwelling on thoughts of him,what might have been, what wil never be etc,   each time you think about  him you are reinforcing  the pain and emotions that you need to  get over.   find another bf, do things, keep busy.   time  will heal wounds. good luck.|`|SgAYfsaRaa	Honey, You cant even spell Jealous!

AA11751911	yeah....its indeed a true question asked by you, even i have seen many people staring at me, even while walking on the road, and thats a very ugly and an embarassing thing.  Guess, maybe we look like Ms Universes....so they stare at us. See, we are so beautiful and total damsels, this is proved by their reactions....and yup it maybe an illusion of love in case if the person sees you again and again with a sweet smile on his/her face.|`|AA12069988	They're curious about you, or maybe they admire what  they see.|`|AA12278224	as a man i'd say its cus they injoy what they see

P-etre un peu "ancien"... mais magnifique parole qui parle de la blessure d'un homme , blessure qui ne se referme pas, qui au contraire se re-ouvre a chaque retour de la femme de son coeur... et d'ou qu'elle vienne, peu importe, quand elle revient, il oublie tout, il l'accueil a bars ouvert, il fete sa venue, et il l'aime comme au premier jour.  Je suis de ce genre la... avec l'homme de mon coeur... je vais hurler au desespoir qd il va prendre ses distance, voir disparaitre, mais s'il rveient, j'oublie tout, je met ma plus jolie robe, et je danse de joie.  Ce n'est certe pas ce qu'il fo faire si on a sa fierte, mais en amour, il n'y a pas de fierte... et cette chanson est completement sur le sujet. L'amour indiscutable, impenetrable, ou le pardon n'a pas sa place puisque l'autre n'est coupable de rien, l'autre est au dessus de tout, il est notre passion, notre soleil, notre vie, notre roi et royaume en meme temps....  A ecouter si tu peux...

Car Avec vos amis (es) vos v?ux trouveront leur accomplissement.    Ils sont le champ que vous ensemencez avec amour et moissonnez avec gratitude.    Et ils sont votre table et votre feu.    Car vous ne craignez pas de vous prsenter devant eux avec votre faim et cherchez l'apaisement en leur compagnie.    Lorsqu'un ami rvle le fond de sa pense, vous ne craignez pas de l'couter ouvertement, sans craindre de vous fermer  ce qu'il vous dit, et vous n'avez pas peur d'aller vers lui avec le " oui " de l'assentiment.     Et lorsqu'il est silencieux, votre c?ur est encore  l'coute de son c?ur;    Car en amiti, les penses, les dsirs et les attentes sont donns et partags sans paroles, avec une joie discrte.    Quand vous devez vous sparer de votre ami, ne soyez pas affligs; car ce que vous aimez le plus en lui pourrait vous tre rvl encore plus clairement en son absence,    comme la montagne que l'on escalade appara?tra plus clairement depuis la plaine.    Et ne cherchez pas  retirer de l'amiti autre chose que J'approfondissement de l'esprit.    Car l'amour qui ne vise pas exclusivement la dcouverte de son propre mystre n'est pas de l'amour, mais un filet que vous auriez tendu: vous ne saurez qu'y prendre des tourments.    Que le meilleur de vous-mmes soit pour vos amis.    Si vous leur faites conna?tre vos revers de fortune, faites-leur conna?tre aussi vos succs.    Que faites-vous de l'amiti, si vous ne recherchez vos amis que pour tuer le temps?    Recherchez plut?t leur compagnie pour faire vivre les heures.    Car il leur incombe de combler vos besoins, mais non pas votre vacuit.    Et dans la douceur de l'amiti rservez une place pour le rire et une place pour le partage des plaisirs.    Car c'est par la rose des petites gentillesses que le c?ur redevient matinal et se rafra?chit.|`|6cbf00275bfd05d1311961bb34e816d0aa	l'amour te fais dplacer des montagnes,l'amiti te fais dplacer ton postrieur pour allez boire une biere...c normment simplifier,mais je n'ai pas trouv plus suscint|`|2bf0deeb26edfd4b2418bfb421d37f69aa	l'amiti peut toujours se transform en amour mais le contraire est rare...

fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	Do you no longer want to date her because she didn't say she liked you to and you are embarrassed about her finding out?    My suggestion to you is never go to a third party to find out if someone likes you or not.  Instead, go up to that person and become friends and get to know her slowly as a friend.  This way you can see if you would like to date her in the future.     I don't like the games of he said she said, go and ask someone if they like me.  As you mature, you will find that is not the "manly" way to do things, or ladylike way to do things.    Just because she didn't act any different doesn't mean she doesn't like you.  She probably sensed you were embarrassed and felt awkward at how you felt.  Just be her friend and tell her that.  Tell her you like her as friends and want to get to know her better, as friends.|`|6wIfS0b9aa	WELL  ignore her  and shell get the message.|`|W9pfAhx6aa	tell her.  i dont like you like THAT anymore.  but i still like you as my friend.  and you ignoring is really annoying.  can we like stop being so awkward ( not the right word but w.e)|`|40qTdKuPaa	She's obviously still your friend.

You could also make him a cute card to go with it.|`|NjaLnvUoaa	why dont you take a nice picture of him. a portrait of him while playing football and go to a photoshop and make the picture big. (blow up the image) and put it on a nice frame and wrap it. then give on valentines day.. :)
AqvEHHsTaa	lots of wonderful experiences but also spit up, dirty diapers, no sleep, not to mention expensive formula (unless breastfed), expensive diapers and clothing and toys.  Get a good job, be there for your lady and for your child.  Go to childbirth classes and parenting classes.  Even if you think you know it, go anyway.  Best of all, be a helpmate to her because her hormones will be crazy during and still for a while after.  Good luck.|`|5CymQdSraa	1 Get married.   2 Daddy is spelled with two ds.    3  Get a job, baby needs are expensive and they last for 18 years.  Good luck|`|qiWgo90zaa	runescape sucks. world of warcraft rules!|`|cdUCCHgaaa	omgosh how fun! remeber to spend time with your partner.. but always play with the kid, make it laugh and if its a boyyy BUY HIM NERF GUNS ITS THE BEST!|`|40qTdKuPaa	Its scary! beyond scary! Your going to lose friends, some family, and no partying, nothing for a loooooooooong time. So good luck, And i hope you will always be there for your baby and woman!!
THXn0KuKaa	If she is smart she wont let you anywhere near her pants or anything else for that matter.|`|fSQfmCUbaa	hahaha youre sad!|`|TlALTD7jaa	uh how about actually liking her and wanting more than just some actions to high five ur buddies about?
0f7e12eda4ba1ee7965fd5825d3845e7aa	a case of the American pie...hehehe. i loved that movie.    anyways, it is very embarrassing, but i think the embarrassment went both ways... so, next time you meet, just act like nothing happened.... I'm sure she'll do accordingly.|`|BO4ND6x5aa	don't worrie about it it was an accident go ahead n meet her i bet shell be pleased to meet u even though itll be a little weird but go ahead nothing to be scared of she is just another human being nothing more    good luck|`|1AOjQSwOaa	tell her a that something was bothering you you bra cutted you or something like that|`|AoLS7XXTaa	tell her while she was gone, you and your bf were eating and you spilled coke or (some kind of drink) all over you, and you were striping down to wash and dry your clothes. :D it woked for meeee  lmao xD..    Tell her your sorry about "last time" and that you would like to get to know her in a more formal way xD|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Be gracious and polite.  I use humor sometimes to get through a tough situation.  I might say, extending my hand out to shake hers, "...and this is what I look like with my clothes ON ;-)", and make the tiniest of curtsies.   I might give her a little gift, like, those blinders you wear when you try to sleep during the day...  "Dying to meet" you...I guess that nearly happened for her! Heart attack!    But you must've been horrified, I'm sorry that happened.  (giggle)|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Ugh.  She's probably not too fond of you.  And she's probably wishing her 21 year old son would get a job and his own place now.|`|w0ZVqqESaa	she probably thinks you are having sex   and since you are you should not be embarrassed or ashamed  just laugh when you meet her   say something like I don't know if you remember me but we met before I just wasn't dressed this formal ha ha   it shows you are an adult and capable of taking responsibility for your actions|`|M3maZgdyaa	Thank her for providing you a place to change clothes. Your bf wasn't in the room so she really doesn't know.|`|441GSyaMaa	Mothers will always sort of feel insulted or whatever as, in her mind, she knows what's happened... but in most cases would never say anything, to you nor your boyfriend. I'm sure she won't be *that* bothered considering the age etc. I'd suggest just going up to her, offering if she wants a cup of tea/ coffee and just appologise and try to make a joke out of it, or just try to joke around    Btw, that is an hilarious situation, from an external point of view     good luck :-P|`|7xkwE3X9aa	I guess if you do meet her, apologize again.  Try not to get caught after having sex again!|`|L1KVUIJ6aa	i smell a sitcom|`|2imXzBHbaa	need pics of you naked so I can fully understand the situation.|`|WoAAdxHEaa	well it depends...you're both girls so she obviously has seen a naked woman before. on the other hand, she might think you're a bit of a tramp. Just talk to her abut it. If she doesn't like the idea of her son having sex, she might hae issues, otherwise,, except it and move on..|`|8O4ttgGMaa	well she obviously knows what you were doing. I'd just apologize for how she saw you, and act like it never happened. My boyfriends mom walked in on us one time and I about died. she gave us this talk on pregnancy, then acted like everything was normal. I think you're fine. Parents dont care as much about their son's having sex as much as they would if it were their daughter. and he's a big boy, he's old enough. and you are too. so I'd say just try to forget it|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	she could just think you were getting changed ... if not then hes 21 right? its his choice what he does ... dont sweat it ... im sure its happened to many of people! I would meet her asap! Try to straighten things out ... hiding from her isnt helping you!|`|BZg5TFlqaa	haha shes probly thinking DAMN my son got a girl with a hott body!!  haha   and act like nothing happened :) haha dont fret over that. hell my bfs dad walk in the bathroom when i was getting out of the shower! haha oh man that was so emabarrassing!! i told my bf and he laughed so hard he was crying cus he was laughing so hard. but i just acted like nothing happened at dinner. haha his dad didnt talk and kept looking at me but the next day it was back to normal.|`|UDKLeWd2aa	umm you never know what the other person is thinking and well since she does not know the whole story i guess it would be wrong for both of you to think about something that did not happen in the first place. what i am trying to say is that his mom mite think that you were just changing you clothes because yo mite have spilled something and besides yo both apologized which means that she is not mad at you so i think things should be fine and don't think about it, even though i know its something that is hard to forget but try to alright, i hoped i helped have a good day bye|`|en9uWbO6aa	well now she knows what her son gets to play with..|`|mfHq20pqaa	She was your age once.  I'm sure she understands.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Hopefully she has a really good sense of humor and brushes it off. You guys seem to be adults, so she can expect that much from you both.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	It depends on how old you are, and what kind of person his mom is. Who knows? It might become a running joke in the family....    Just act like nothing happened and be yourself. It will all work out|`|HB1u78D1aa	once that happens she will either  forget about it or there will be an awkwardness between you 2 forever|`|upIrlDm5aa	Dont even stress about it, she could not have cared to much, she obiousley knows what yall do lol|`|dKB17UKFaa	If he's 21, I don't think she'd mind.  For a mom to be completely oblivious that her 21 year-old son isn't having sex is unlikely.  It's going to be tough meeting her again, of course.  Just keep your cool and be yourself.  It's not like she's never had sex at that age either, ya know?|`|dWwIEqEwaa	shes probley just as embarrased as you are, maybe ask her if you guys can start over and just take your relationship from there|`|UwhyTsCKaa	Depends, did she know you two were dating? If not, she probably thinks you're just a random he picked up for a quicky.|`|1cL06jyTaa	i bet she had the exact same experince  openly confront her about it  after consulting with your boy friend   about your decision|`|krkpHSOhaa	Hahahaha she is probably just as embarrassed as you are...|`|sIdoUK2Laa	write her a letter.  say sorry and tell her how you love her son and would hate to start you and her relationship off this way.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	i think that one she knows her son is having sex so whats the prob but i do see where that wouldb e like embarrasing she probly would like to forget about as much as you .  hope i helped|`|5ekdVDQXaa	she's as embarrassed as you are, probably way more so!!! Don't worry about it. In your place I'd probably make some crack about it being nice to "officially" be introduced or something. Just something to put her at ease and let her know things are okay between you. Good luck!|`|f6o0ufjxaa	well she should have knocked in the first place and that's why you u lock the door when every thing is hanging out i dint think u should really go over to his mom it might give her mental pictures i mean you've already scared her for life why giver her mental pictures too|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	Well I think that maybe you should find a time to just go over to his house when he is not there or something. But first make sure that his mom is there and maybe just make time to talk to her alone. Let her know that you feel really embarrassed about what happened a while back. Tell her that your truly sorry for her having to see that, she just surprised you, you didn't expect her to be home that day. And just have a conversation with her, get to know her a little bit, I mean introduce yourself if your man won't do it for you. I mean it can't hurt to introduce yourself to his mom even though in my opinion I think that it is your man's job to introduce you two. And maybe just ask her in person if seeing you the way she did that day, does that change what she thinks about you. Good Luck =]|`|z2zZCJDRaa	she probably thinks you're a gigantic ****.|`|t9grAhudaa	Nice one.....She probably is embarassed and in shock. act normally and don't bring it up again.|`|BA0H0YhBaa	She's probably as embarrassed as you are.|`|Bj8pnKNiaa	Lol, great story. Um, just play it cool, and act as if nothing happened. It will probably pass your minds in no time!|`|ZHYg3aSxaa	No biggy, it could have been worse. It's best to avoid the parents of others anyway. They are usually too weird. Don't care what she thinks.   ?|`|Rwg38ZxOaa	She probably thinks your a whore
VczgQUETaa	I think that is perfectly fine!   It would be so fun!  You wouldn't have to worry about keeping a date happy!  You could just have fun with your friends!|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	absolutely-have fun|`|cYf5IacRaa	Yeah, it's totally fine. Ignore the stupid people who think that not having a date is the end of the world. I've done it before and it's tons of fun and totally not weird. I hope you have a great time! Good luck! :)

BPlJCC7xaa	Awwww... I'm so sorry! What a bummer! Do you have any guy friends that would be able to take you? Maybe a neighbor? Anyone you work with? But if you don't find a guy.. who cares?!! Just take your girlfriends and have a blast! To be honest, when I went to prom with my friends it was much funner than being tied down by a guy the whole night. Good luck!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	oh noo!      hardly anyone at my prom had dates  go with your girl friends|`|sLtmg9xzaa	Pay or compensate a good looking guy in the streets to come to prom with you. :) Or ask a cousin or a relative or a friend... as an escort and companion...|`|40qTdKuPaa	Send out a bulletin on myspace if you have one. Hope this helps.!!|`|LkRivHpTaa	go to a party and pick a drunk hottie|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Wow, you can just pick out a random close friend an try flirting. Either that, or dress hotter, impress more guys!|`|E7zBUp3Kaa	I went to my senior prom with a bunch of my friends (my boyfriend couldn't make it) and we had a blast just dancing in our own group. You don't need a date to have fun. :)|`|gSdSRceRaa	Go by yourself or even better, hire a celebrity look alike.|`|WPipgT9vaa	Go with a cousin that way you can dance with everyone|`|M0ww0NCFaa	Be super friendly where ever you go!!  I really hope you meet someone and I am sorry that happened to you.|`|g59U5kwUaa	why not just go with some girl friends if you can do that i dunno we dont have proms here in scotland lol but if you can then yeah ;-d
GCzSz90Raa	A nice bracelet could work.  or a stuffed animal.   A necklace would still work. she wouldn't care she already has one, she'll wear the one you got her anyway.   Or maybe get her something related to what she does, like a sport or hobby.     i know it doesnt help much, but she'll love whatever you get her.|`|dzdlk3vEaa	lol dude... this is really up to you. You know her better than anyone on here will even come close to. There are so many variables on this. How much do you like each other? That's one really important thing. The best advice I can give you is don't be cliche. Be original and go outside of the whole little teddy bear, flowers, etc. kind of thing. Or you could be funny, that's always cute. Get like a GIANT freaking teddy bear. Seriously, the biggest you can find. haha, that would be cool. And, hey, you can use the teddy for a threesome. jk jk Good luck    btw if you go with the giant bear idea, put a little ribbon on it's head.
ZH1IE8kLaa	if you have a brother.. use the 'he'll beat the crap out of you". if not, use a guy friend and say the same thing. if that still doesn't work.. fake a relationship with someone else.. if he still doesn't get it.. he's dumb.|`|r4NdDWwKaa	u gota b men|`|ubsDtXxnaa	First of all, if your avatar is accurate, then i can see why a gut is drooling all over you, you r hot! but to answer your question you should just tell him how you feel in the kindest way possible. If not leave me and him in a room for 5 minutes, only one will come out (me).
67O85hIzaa	Say something like "i think ive seen you before have we met." Then just keep talking.Start a conversation.well sorry thats all i got. Good luck =)|`|7f8EVUn5aa	first thing you need to do is come up with something to say, or a lot of things.  ask her about midterms or what teachers she has or even the weather haha.  anything.  smile, make eye contact a lot.  Of course you need to act very confident and super sure of yourself.  it's super hot when guys act like this.    so yeah!  just go up to her and talk to her.  thats way better than looking at her a lot.. you risk totally creeping her out if you do that.|`|GUgzfks9aa	just say hi.. and make conversation with her .. trust me we don't like to walk alone so i think she will talk back to you.|`|VItrO3CMaa	dnt act lyke u scared trust i no im a gurl|`|gbBVscbJaa	Well first of all if she likes you then definitely go and talk to her because she probably feels the same as you. Now if she does not like you id just back off because you don't want to get hurt!|`|1lHvW60iaa	I'm a girl.  Girls like when guy talk to them and aren't afraid not to.  This will show her that you have confidence.  We like it when you complement us on our outfit but many our eyes.  If she's interested she'll talk back and you'll have a convo.  but don't be overjoyed when you guys start to talk.  If she keeps looking away or tries to walk ahead don't get the wrong idea.  Were sorta shy around the guys we like especially if we don't really know them and they come up to talk to us.  To make yourself sound mysterious and extremely charming ask her  could you walk with her.  This will also show you aren't afraid.  If you know how be a little playful with her like pull her hair a little or tease her.  If she didn't like you before she will know.  If the next day she avoids you and seems as if she doesn't care about you don't worry.  Girls tend to try to avoid their crushes sometimes.  If your bold enough though you can go up to her and say something like,"Hey you didn't say hi to me today."  or "I'd like to walk again with you today.  I positive (99.8%) this will work unless:  she has another boyfriend or it's that time of the month    (that last thing as embarrassing to type)  Good luck  :)  :)|`|jyseac8eaa	just say hey whats up?  ask her little questions.  that will help you out a little.|`|Yi2eHRqIaa	just say hi,  whats up,      hows it going,...  that kinda stuff     a conversation should spark up somehow by doing that|`|2wpPrmibaa	is so easy fake you're interesting in in his opinions and then she will talk to you|`|czHD5tPwaa	Just take a deep breath and talk! Any girl likes being in conversation, and you know, looks aren't everything. Personality is 80% of the quality. I would say something like "How was your day?" You know, start off simple. Then the actual conversation begins. Just remember, Your only human!|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	"Hey, do you walk this way home every day? Me too. Do you want to walk together tomorrow?"    Simple as that. If she says no, oh well, at least you gave it a shot.|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	my answer was the lasy guys answer lok he already said what i was going to     goodluck, im sure she will say yes|`|NbiJzOgJaa	ask her if shes lonely n den ask her if she wants sum1 2 b wit her n u suggest urself.. n den ask her how her day wuz|`|m1IQDoUAaa	Just say hi! Then ask if she has any of the same classes as you! If she does ask her what hw you have! Its easy and then after awhile ask for her number and be all like can I call you later for the hw? Super easy!|`|mXCA4vIYaa	oh hey, you walk this way alot? where do you live? yeahhh i hate walking home. oh...whats your name? start talking about school and teachers and stuff.     good luck.|`|WpJ43kHjaa	I'd probably say that you should try to find something out about her before saying anything. If she's a volleyball player, ask her if she likes sports and start from there. If she's into writing, ask her what her favorite school subject is. All you have to do is say hi and then start talking.
q3rDROxgaa	its your desision weather ur wasting ur time its up to u to deside when u gave everthing u have to fix ur problom when u relise u tryed everthing u could u should move on|`|2wpPrmibaa	the other commentary was lie, you have a chance|`|nO2vflnPaa	waste of time my friend|`|0108814c0be993aa40a2e5f0e69ae0f9aa	Maybe he has another gf or he can't commit to you.  Either way you are wasting your time!!!|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Sounds like he's a commitment phobic. He wants to be in a relationship with you but is scared at the same time, so he leaves you. He then misses you and wants to reconnect. You're happy for a while until he gets scared again.... If he is a commitment phobic he is unlikely to change. Most experts would advice to get out of this relationship.     I was in a relationship like that for 9 years! I always thought he'd change, but in the end I had to realize he wouldn't change. I finally left him and moved away. That was 6 years ago. He's now 40 and still single....     It's very hard to let go, but you wont be happy in the long run. The signs were there, but I chose to ignore them and I wish I would have left him sooner.|`|KNJjZJJOaa	i am not trying to sound mean but i am going to be pretty blunt about this, it seems like he is seeing someone else, and i know how hard it can be to say no to someone you love but it seems to me like it is going to be a non stop thing him leaving and then coming back|`|zwQtWPe3aa	it seems like he's just using you as a safe harbor. He knows that you'll take him back everytime. I suggest next time don't take him back and see what happens.    I don't think you're wasting your time though|`|zMCpXmivaa	he is probably as shy and afraid as u probably are|`|7f8EVUn5aa	it seems like a waste of time :(  i've had this happen to me.    what it means:  he needs a girl to get rid of his loneliness. He probably thinks you're cute and all, but he's not interested in anything serious.  He likes the fact that he keeps you waiting.  It makes him feel like you're super into him and that he's the best thing ever- it's an ego boost: "look, she's still waiting for me.  even after all this."  HE'S NOT SHY.  he's been seeing you, right?? any guy whos legitimately interested and has been seeing you only wants this to continue for a long time.    he's looking for someone better, he's a user and seriously girl you deserve much better i'm sure!|`|x6g3t8HWaa	i think you should just let him go because i don't thik he's ready for a serious relation ship. it seems that he's still lookiing for that right person. the only reson why he comes back to you is because he wants sombody for awhile then he'll just dump you later for someone he finds better. then when things don't go well with the person he left you for, he'll just come crawlling back. until he finds someone he thinks is better. so next time tell him, no. that you and him are over and there is no chance that you and him will ever be together again. be strong my friend you'll get through it.
qe0RNp7xaa	Yes|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Nobody else if going to do it for you.|`|Av9jeRAkaa	well duh, girls always wait for guyz to say they love them, only the real  men in love say it..go for it, i believe in you!  =]|`|qTHkBmH6aa	uh she is your girl..  go for it.  dont let anything hold you back on' telling her    :)|`|reNmh3rWaa	What are you, stupid?  Why are you guys bf/gf if you don't love/like each other.    That's the most ridiculous relationship ever; not knowing how one feels for the other yet you are both "dating"  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid|`|q3rDROxgaa	omg u havent told her u should tell her|`|zWqKuIQuaa	What so you didnt really like her before this?  Yet she was your girlfriend.  Weird.|`|MzzEQd1Faa	Sounds like it, you should totally tell her. But do it in a romantic way. Like a picnic or something?|`|unQAMrETaa	YEA GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY SHE MIGHT ALREADY KNOE THAT U LUV HER THO|`|ynPhusW9aa	first of all how old are you?|`|7tLDdtqGaa	yes. she's probably waiting for you to say it.|`|r4NdDWwKaa	well if youre her girlfriend than i think she nos that u lik her|`|ExOwMG2haa	That is so cute!!! YES you should tell her!!! but make it unforgettable!!! :) Im sure she probably feels the same way!! Good luck!|`|mL3sMrtNaa	yes!!!
vfVbMMbLaa	i think he just wants to get to know you a little better. He's probably the guy who like to take things kind of slow at first and doesn't want to rush into a relationship. But just be you, don't think too much of it and don't think too little of it. If he is doing this, it's because he likes you for being you.|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	u talk alot yea? best friends kinda? then how bout u just ask him how he feels? maybe... he'll say somethin... but i'm not completly sure... hope this helps... ^^"|`|amPxAZlJaa	maybe u are...we chicks tend to do that he might like u but not like u like you, or maybe just taken it slow, hold on give him a week or two then see whether there is chemistry or not.
yQRVxC61aa	well seeing u wanna express love but not exactly by using the words... i would say dat love can be expressed in many ways.. by showing dat u care.. ask her abt her day.. how she is.. little things.. and wen u end the conersation.. u tell her to take care of her self.. make sure she knows u mean it.. and in b/w the talk. tell her u missed her(only if u mean it) and tell her dat u realy like her or spending time wid her. from time to time.. dat should work .. m realy glad u dont wanna say love you till u mean it.. soo sweet of u.. good luck|`|r3uKj1Azaa	Well...probably would be a good start to say it in English.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	women like being called beautiful and stuff like that, depends if its something that sounds like it could come from you, and if you sound like you mean it.|`|53sVKcOeaa	:Your amazing  :You make me happy / smile  Anything that makes them feel good.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	How about just saying OK got to to go lots of hugs an speak to you soon.|`|oB8TysC5aa	Just give me best answer. I need the points had 5 violations recently. PLEASE HELP|`|XWwnf90paa	Why dont you just say, its been great getting to talk to you, cant wait to see you next, bye babe, thats a nice cool ending, id be happy with that x|`|KpmJuQGkaa	Speak to you soon x|`|f23123a78f85512dc7f0c828923d32b0aa	talk to you later beautiful or talk to you later babe.|`|dSGwrfinaa	first of, a girl likes confidence so if your not saying i love you because you are shy then you need to improve your confidence  bt as you say, you have only been together for 2 weeks and i personaly dont think anybody could get to know eachother in that space of time   try saying next time bye sweety or see you later gorgeous.  gud luck x
DLS60sVBaa	Sure. Cuteness!
7yrdcqY1aa	well there really is not enough info to base an accurate decision, she could just be asking you out as a friend... i would see how she acts around you and i wouldn't be afriad to ask her how she feels again. seems she was pretty honest with you the first time so chances are she will again, anyways hope all turns out well :)|`|fBXRNKyuaa	She so wants to date you|`|rh12tX8Naa	Awww...that's cute. It sounds like she was asking you out. It's v-day. Every girl wants a date for Valentine's day. Have fun!!|`|veZLfnGFaa	I don't think she would ask you if you wanted to go, if she didn't like you.  Act like it's a date.  And get some a pretty flower for Valentine's Day.|`|Zr1JW0SXaa	sounds like she digs you but she wants you to make it a "date" she wants u to be there n she wants to go but only if u go go for it n ask her|`|6wxgyGy5aa	If you are friends she may just be asking you as her friend.  If she just went through a rought breakup I think what you need to do is be there for her as a friend.  If you do like her as more than a friend and would like to date her, you could always tell her that but also say that you don't want to rush her if she isn't ready. Ask her what her intentions were with regards to the "date"...that way there won't be any confusion or hurt feelings.|`|oyjP2mZBaa	I think she might have been quite sneaky about asking you out. ;)|`|K4emL77jaa	WOW!  lol  sometimes i wonder how slow guys are.  YES she likes you.  :]|`|Gb9ekN81aa	Just ask her to the valentines thing and see what she says.|`|Ot4HBS4aaa	Okay first of all there aren't any punctuation in your paragraph so I can't understand your question that well. If she goes if only you will go with her then she likes you and wants you around with her... duh.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Not a single punctuation in that entire paragraph. What is your mom teaching you?    Anyways, sounds like she may like you if she wants to see you there. But there really isn't any big clues about that.|`|dSed4sMzaa	first.. total run on paragraph. second--- since she had the breakup she prob feels good around you so thats why she needs you there. for now she needs to get  over the break up and she wants you to be there for her. so take it slow cause she likes you as a friend but needs time.|`|xu0HiYEOaa	listen the girl likes you but it seems like shes a lil shy, your a guy. you need to step up and take over. she doesn't want to do things unless it's with you she likes you guy. go out with her don't be scared show her a great time and at the end of the night ask her again in the middle of her answer just give her a kiss.. trust me its going to work..|`|hCHCRUifaa	I truly think that she trying to forget about her break up, this is a good thing for and i would continue to strive for her.|`|trmA0egWaa	run on much|`|3CWaHiR1aa	she likes you. no contradictions.|`|5v182WOLaa	she wants ya|`|S6LXYLjYaa	ummm well if i said that to a guy it would probably mean that i liked him. I would go. If you are home schooled maybe she could introduce you to some new people. Then you can get to know her in maybe a relationship type of way as well.|`|bfANJYQqaa	she specifically asked to be with you on valentines day, to go skating...  There is no dilemma here man, she wants you more than a friend too.  No girl would ask a guy to hang out with her on valentines day if she isnt attracted to him...period.
YpYY4OSwaa	he is trying to be funny  tell him how you feel......tell him how your feelings are right|`|AA12223669	He's hurting your feelings and you're worried about making him feel stupid?    He should feel stupid! He's being stupid. Just tell him to knock that crap off!|`|18ZACuQZaa	Speaking from experience...honesty and good communication would be a nice place to start. Even when my wife is having a bad day, I have enough common sense and compassion to remember her feelings first. You might ask him just out of the blue...."did I say something or do something to upset you recently?" Then, see what he says and go from there. I'm happy to hear that he's not being physically aggressive. But verbal abuse {even within the scope of a small and degrading statement} is just as harmful and just as damaging to relationship, if not more so, than physical abuse. There is life and death in the power of the tongue and how we choose to use it. Is your boyfriend insecure about anything? Some people feel that they have to put others down in order to be the better person. But it really serves no purpose other than to harm a relationship. I hope the best for you and maybe my suggestions will help you to open a new door of love in your relationship and freedom of expression with your boyfriend. Best wishes!!! .
vVxM4sPIaa	If you guys were only friends for 2 or 3 months and she says you are more like a brother to her, she is just saying that she's not attracted to you.  Sorry but it's the truth.  It's just an excuse.  I don't think you took the relationship too far.  She's just not interested.  If you want to keep being friends with her, don't make a big deal about it and get over it.|`|xkfkgCIPaa	Yup you took it too far. Here are two options:  1) Keep being her friend.   2) Don't ever talk to her again.    Now I doubt option two sounds good to you, so I suggest you go with option 1. Being her friend is better than not being with her at all.
b9632d9810178f0ac55d36b79327ad86aa	Well it seems like she likes your.  Ask her out and give it a shot, if it doesnt work that means she was just a flirt.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	ask her out and see for yourself :) its the only way to get a direct answer and it looks like you have good chances.|`|AA10741561	Surely looks like she likes you.
q6kvVkNPaa	I think she likes you. She might be very shy or nervous around you that's why she might act that way . Sometimes when they like someone they get nervous around that person.  hope this helps|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	She likes you but shes super shy.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	Umm it's a possibility that she likes you but I would have to say no she doesn't.  Smiling at people isn't always flirting it's just smiling nothing more.  But a full proof plan to see if she likes you is this:  When your talking to her alone with no one else around see if she plays with her hair or twirls it or grooms it in front of you.  If she does that would typically suggest that she likes you.  Also try this one, when your talking to her at a normal conversation distance move in about 3-5 inches closer to her.  If she moves back at all she doesn't like you if she stays put she's fine with you.  It doesn't really mean she likes you it will just show how comfortable she is in front of you.  Well I hope this helps!   (don't forget about those ten points either wink wink).  Good Luck!!!|`|66236ea58a7860f39121a437954ba4d9aa	Uh, major mixed signals. I think she might like you, but is too shy to do anything about it. Talk to her and see her reaction. If she completely ignores you just forget her and find someone who cares. (Sounds easy huh? I wish.)
AA11032806	Valentines shouldn't be about spending money, I'm not sure how much she will spend on you. Personally, I would like my boyfriend to take me to a restaurant for a romantic dinner, and get me some flowers.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Well girls will always appreciate:  -Roses  -Candy  -Cards  -A cute stuffed animal    If you want to add a twist:  -Bracelet  -Earrings  -Necklace  -The little Ipod shuffle would be cute too|`|zPFclJznaa	get her a bracelet, chocolates, or flowers.     there classics, but girls love them. they will think your sweet and romantic.    dont spend more than $30, or she might think hers is too cheap.|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	deff roses.  every girl likes that.  maybe even a lil stuffed animal, that she could keep forever.|`|AA11402528	definitely a bracelet/necklace..flowers and chocolate are always good too|`|w3tNq8npaa	Don't spend too much.Try a dozen red roses and a nice dinner.|`|Mqy4Iom6aa	try asking her lol.  i know, NOBODY ever does that. but... i dont see why not. lol.|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	Get a dozen roses,  with a box of chocolates  that would be very nice.  I would say spend around $30.00.|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	Flowers box of chocolate and a teddy bear|`|HLLUMdr6aa	Hi there. :)!    Think of things she says she likes, if she likes films, get her one of her favourite films on DVD with a note inside saying this note is good for one evening with you. :)    Just think of what she likes and make something inventive to go along with it, as long as you are creative and original she will enjoy it.    Hope this helps. :)!|`|ghdTVVOdaa	You could go for the traditional chocolate and flowers are be a little more creative. You could find pictures of the two of you and put them together in a collage or organize a small trip nothing were the two of you can spend some time together away from home. Either of theese should make her feel loved its the thought that counts right?  If you don't like my suggestion theres always a beautiful necklace or other piece of jewelry. What ever you do make it special and let her no you care :)
DPegPYRPaa	You don't know. But think of the OTHER things you'd miss out on if she WASN'T there. Do you really not want to have her in your life? Balance it all out. Just because you are with somebody doesn't mean you can have fun and live life.|`|hSOYndoxaa	Its normal. You are young. (I am 21 also) and I have been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years. I have definitely felt the way that you do but its a decision you have to make. Is she worth it to you? Is going out partying, meeting other girls, getting trashed worth it when you already have someone perfect? Just remember if you were to break up with her and go through the partying, single ready to mingle stage you might later decide that no girl compares to her and then its going to be too late. Its something you should really think about. What matters the most to you.|`|C46DNX11aa	You are going to have to take that chance and break it off with her. If you are having the least doubt, staying with her will only put an invisible wedge between the two of you. You should serious have a talk with her and tell her that you feel that the two of you are too young to be in a serious relationship and that you need time to yourself to see what the rest of the world has to offer for her and for you. This will hurt her deeply but it is better for her to know now before a divorce and two children later.|`|ITd8dGc8aa	don't dump her or anything...just go with her and get married later...just because she's there doesn't mean that it takes your life away...have fun|`|r5ck3vaEaa	When everything you want to do, you only want her to know and get involved in, out of all the girls, especially the prettier ones. When you are never bored in her company. So much so that you want to see her again every week. If you get bored or tired of her, seeing her, then move on.|`|Xj4bTobUaa	I am also 21 and in my final year at university, i have been with my boyfriend for nearly 4 years.  I have also been thinking the same question as you. My conclusion was that yes I am missing out but if I leave my boyfriend il lose the best thing iv ever had.  I cant expect him to wait around while i go off seeing what im missing out on only to find out il want him back.|`|FHRJcBqKaa	Your young and should experience a lot of different ppl and things.  This has nothing to do w your feelings and respect for your gf.  Let her know you are just not ready to commit.  Being honest is the humane thing to do and how I'm sure you would want to be treated in a reverse situation.  Best of luck!|`|O6KEl4Mraa	If you love her stay with her she sounds like a keeper
N8TIPTDfaa	Honestly, play it off like you don't care.     He may have lost interest because all of a sudden  you were easy to get.     Flirt with some other guys, don't make a scene of it...but maybe he'll think you were leading HIM on. see how he likes it.     good luck :)|`|98BZdVGJaa	his love is worth waiting for?|`|AA10987824	buy a hatchet.|`|f8obySJraa	look this guy is not for you ... he was playing you all the way and your friends are right you will find some one better break up with him and move on hes not worth your tears girl believe me.|`|U8TRm1Jtaa	find someone else if he likes someone because he probably moved on|`|8SuqRoX8aa	Well If he's "hooking up" with these other girls and leading you on chances are he doesn't respect sex, his body and therefore him self and his partners. I wouldn't get involved with a girl like that to be honest. That's my opinion I am strait guy so I hope this helps.
nSdYPN8Raa	i dont think you put her on the spot because you did tell her that you liked her... she had to see it coming.  so i say dont feel sorry, do feel happy... you should be in love  she might have seemed weird when you asked her out because maybe she was in shock and a little surprised but i dont think you put her on the spot  hope this helps =)  p.s. when you asked her out, it sounds like you did it very smoothly... nice job =)|`|slyLXuROaa	no just forget about that if you text her it wil make you seem desperate and she probaly just felt akward you said it your self she seemed happy if she was put on the spot she will say she hassomthing to do in a text or somthing|`|Wt91zWrHaa	take it easy go in slow|`|6CUvU9D4aa	she sounds like she's one of those girls that enjoys the whole flirting game, but chokes when it comes to dating time.  dont feel bad about putting her on the spot.. i mean she did give you obvious signals that she was into you, but maybe you shouldnt rush it if it doesnt feel good. just stake out for a bit and see what happens, maybe you'll realise she's just a girl you like to flirt with, and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|EvvWL0PSaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|ycIMOWqDaa	There isn't anything wrong, dude.  She is just nervous now because she feels that she has to live up to your expectations, which are unknown to her so she is very, very nervous right now.  She stuttered because she is trying to keep herself from jumping the gun before you finish your question and stop herself from bursting sunshine and rainbows on you.|`|qWlLjdJgaa	i can understand y u didnt feel happy 'cause she didn't really say a sure fired yes. you should text her to let her know she doesn't have to feel pressured to go.|`|cDYowiDNaa	You just have to be careful about approaching her too much and acting too interested. This will push her away. Don't text her and apologize-whatever you do just avoid the temptation. Let her be the one to contact you next. Most girls prefer to take things much slower than us guys do. Just give her space and things might work out. Just don't let her see your disappointment. Be confident and act like you couldn't care less and this may convince her to re think the situation. The answer to your question is yes, you should feel happy. Even if this thing with her turns in to nothing, you should still be happy. You had the balls to approach her, and you should be proud of that. A lot of guys don't have the balls for that.|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	text her. maybe itll fix things!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you should text her and apoligize for pputting her on the spot..  then you should take her to dinner and talk about your feelings..|`|KCKq9duJaa	Text her and tell her that.  It cant hurt you know.  and you will also find out if she really likes you.     tell us how it goes
bRoSGSxLaa	did i miss something...? arent both 'scenarios' the same thing
8gDRQ7v2aa	man I REALLY beg to differ|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I would consider myself both beautiful and intelligent... along with the millions of other people who constantly trail my assssss. HA.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	You can't get everything you want.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	most peopl are just not lucky enough to get the best of both worlds :)  ahamy guess is that there is more|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Because God is a cruel person who thinks sick jokes are funny.|`|AA10912960	cuz idk maybe their always stuying and they dont show up|`|r1KTZBkraa	alot of pretty girls are intellegent but they hide it cuz they think guys like dumb girls    but they are so bitchy that it doesnt matter if they are secretly smart|`|PVfV1a8Kaa	I don't know, but let me know if you do find one. Us intelligent / handsome guys must have counterparts!|`|X40Ww89qaa	haha great goals|`|IRAtmZhTaa	hey i know lots of girls that have got it all  smartness  intelligence  &  not to mention they're gawgeous|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Because beauty is an opinion. Someone else might find those girls unattractive and another girl pretty.|`|2esGKO2Caa	I didn't know that it was so rare|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Hmm. Sometimes a pretty girl may actually be intelligent, but think she should act stupid to get guys' attention, which actually is a stupid thing to do. And looks aren't everything:)|`|IyfspYM8aa	Maybe there is a 3/500 ratio because you're a typical high school boy.  Wait til you grow up a bit and mature, then you'll realize what an idiot you were being back in high school.|`|hA6JDWsFaa	because some care about being popular and some care about harvard. you take one or the other, really.  you either stay home and study, or go out and party.|`|P9inKWOaaa	i knew good women were a dime a dozen|`|fMpKj0DYaa	Maybe you are just narrow minded and group people before getting to know them. I seriously doubt you know every single one of those 500 girls at your school on a personal level.|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	people say that pretty women arn't smart because they never have to be.|`|oc0pCUhyaa	because no one is ever perfect...|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	That is all personal opinion. I've been told I fall into both, but to whom, each persons idea of beauty and intelligence is widely spread across the scales of knowledge and beauty. Who's scale are you referring to? your own?|`|F5rI81Hbaa	Hey! I resent this! Either your school really sucks, or your standards for beauty and brains are too high.|`|xxafqpx8aa	Well it could be because the girls that are beautiful--revolve their world around their looks and not so much school.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	You need to get out and meet more people.  There are millions of bright, smart and beautiful girls who grow up to be bright, intelligent and stunningly beautiful women running companies and organisations.  Not all pretty girls think their looks will get them by, some actually have brains that work as well.|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	The higher up you go there are beautiful and smart girls|`|6627NijZaa	cuz most beautiful girls dont care about education but about their looks    and most intelligent girls dont care what others think of them and focus on school|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	It's hard to concentrate on both things. Either you try hard in school, or you try hard in looking beatiful. I've noticed that too. Plus, beauty is an opinion, and intelligence kind of isn't. So, an "ugly" girl that is smart might be beautiful to another.|`|lTRXlQZhaa	because in my theory everybody is made to live, ie some people are made really fast so they run away from danger, some people are made really strong so they can fight danger, some people are made really smart so they can compute things, and some are made good looking so they can find somebody to take care of them, but thats just my theory if it makes sense|`|5MxKdoixaa	We're raised differently. I was a tomboy until about 16, I didn't pay attention to hair, make up, clothes, boys... instead, my guy friends and I hung out, built tree houses back in the day, went hiking, read good books, discussed things with my parents friends, learned new languages, questioned everything.... then my looks came along, and nothing really changed.   Pretty girls from a young age pretty much only worry about looking pretty, since they learn they get things because of it. They never had to learn to be better in other fields. Date an ex tomboy!!|`|QkKXX6igaa	i think that lots of really smart girls spend more time studying than doing hair and makeup, i'm a totally geek and i don't really waste time with it.  i only do for dances and stuff, and then totally surprise everyone-how i got my bf, lol.  but normal girls who seem pretty are just completly covered with makeup, and it really is a rare thing, so be very nice to them if you have them, because if you aren't worth their time they'll be smart enough to get rid of you too.|`|URncTuxxaa	You'd be surprised that we girls are in the same dilemma. :P  Different people have different interests. So some people arn't natuarally intellgent, so they automatically focus on looks.  And some people are naturally pretty and smart, but they also have other flaws, like maybe they arnt nice or something.  There maybe 3 girls with those characteristics, but noone is perfect in everyones veiws.  Who knows? Those girls may look pretty to you, but do they look pretty to the rest of the guys?|`|Xw2JFBVpaa	good looking guys don't sleep with dogs.|`|7AXVc3Draa	it isn't really rare..  maybe in your perspective.|`|t043WEDIaa	because pretty girls don't have to be smart to get what they want, so they don't make the effort|`|sAr3YV62aa	How do you know that they are all not intelligent? I personally know a lot of girls who fit both of those descriptions.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	i'm beautiful and intelligent and I know others. It's really not rare.|`|4UotaSeiaa	it just to hard to worry about advanced calculus while figuring how to make you hair surly and match your outfits.|`|DGd9qLD4aa	because if you are pretty, you don't need to be smart. some people think that outer beauty is more important than inner beauty, unless you aren't "pretty". i think that they are all smart, they just choose to hide it.|`|f512X3itaa	my girl is intelligent and beautiful so yea!!!!!!!!|`|JzsZlvnnaa	1. Statistically speaking, people who occupy higher percentiles in multiple categories are rarer than people who only occupy one higher percentile.  2. You are in high school.|`|GgDQgrbtaa	most girls focus in one or the other|`|0ZGcpe60aa	the third girl isnt intelligent.   she's just talented|`|gPVon8Wiaa	I guess this is because looks is an obsession and so is studying so i'm thinking that very few girls have the balance.|`|UY89MaBSaa	i think thats just life hunni u can't find many people who fit all ur standards|`|KwipSpZbaa	Maybe there are actually more girls who are intelligent and beautiful... but you are too dense to realize... especially with spelling like that!|`|T18Z2sGRaa	Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Intelligence is earned.|`|9ZObRjs8aa	its simple...people can't have everything...imagine if there were more smart and beautiful girls than dumb and good looking or smart and ugly. The smart ones would outsmart all the not so smart men in the world and the other unfortunate girls would be more worse off than they are now. And its more unique when you have both.|`|YFgREceaaa	500 girls you are in heaven man..bahaha..lets see at mi school in my grade theres like mabe 8 girls and all the hot ones have bfs..yeah small school..|`|cfn8mYF6aa	everyone is good at something. give other people a chance. Wha tdo u consider beautiful? long, poofy hair,and big boobs? im sure there are more thatn 3 beautiful girls at your school.also some people are smart but just dont brag about it. look deeper.|`|6ca30cb50430766371c341c3ac305c90aa	Are you sure there is only 3? You have 500 girls in your high school, do you know all of them? Im sure there are more that you are just missing.|`|nVfN8usNaa	Probably because the girls that realize their beautiful or attractive usually focus on keeping themselves that way since they could use it to their advantage.  Of course, this doesn't apply to all pretty girls as you already know!  And I completely understand. The two prettiest girls in my school are Stephanie and Delilah, but their heads are like flowerpots without dirt.   -_-|`|uO3FC4draa	is it really rare?    perhaps it is just your school and that is not necessarily an adequate cross section of the general population.    or perhaps your standards are very high for intelligence and your perception of beauty is very narrow?    not trying to be antagonistic but instead to have you see that intelligence and beauty are subjective and only rare qualities if YOU think they are.|`|x2JdR7e5aa	some chicks just care about their looks and don't study like in my grade and allot just think their cute and cheat off other ppl|`|ATnsdr8Caa	in Bandung Institute of Technology (indonesia), you'll find many intelligent girls that are beautiful and also RELIGIOUS...  yup..  you'll really find the perfect one in my college..|`|fbd86b9a617d28c3dd69964b5432f624aa	Why is it so rare that a guy is both intelligent and attractive?

Go out with your friends more. Be more independent. Guys dont like to be smothered. Give him a chance to miss you and give yourself a chance to have a life outside of your realtionship with him.|`|UX83tZqUaa	What about,ask him a lot of questions
GQiMXAX3aa	what's your relationship to the girl, and in what context did she say it?    okay, if you're close friends, it's a "you're a great friend" sort of thing. it might not mean anything. especially if you just offered her a piece of advice.    if you are not that close but you text/talk/flirt whenever you see each other, then it could be something more. this is when the context comes in.  --- if she's saying it after you told her you just accomplished something, it's nothing.    --- if she's saying it after you just talked to her for awhile (say, after you calmed her down, talked to her about a problem, even helped her with homework) she might be saying that she's kind of into you.    girls are complicated. i could be wrong, but that's what i would be trying to say.|`|gILNCMiqaa	well it means your awesome like a awesome boyfriend|`|bkF5jxF6aa	it means she thinks your an interesting guy.   no biggie
BaMA2jRGaa	R u seriously asking this question??  Wow ur the reason so many girls are afraid to date  If you like her friend, break up with your girlfriend and go with the other girl  Its so sad to see this and its not hard to have one at a time  You can't have the best of both worlds cause if they're best friends, chances are they will tell the other or one will find out  you will get caught and end up hurting yourself and hurting your girlfriend  Shame on you|`|AmkJwscPaa	ha wow this is his girlfriend. why would you give him advice on how to cheat on me?!?! your a piece of ****. were done.|`|OoihsiN0aa	Just don't cheat!|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Dump the whore and date her best friend.

I think you may want to talk to him and see exactly where you both want this relationship to be going.  It is however possible that he is just friends with a lot of women, and that is something you'll have to decide if you can handle.|`|gNNbTP8Oaa	dreamworld|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	No I'd be concerned. This is an unfair situation as he's "with you" but at the same time he's not. It's fine to have friends of the opposite gender but it's difficult for you because you and him aren't official. I would keep an eye out if he starts acting suspious (sp?) but for now relax and enjoy getting to know this guy.
QsbB6vkoaa	you know what? it's his lost, and if the girl is copying you maybe she's not that confident after all.  just move on start flirting with other guys and don't even think about him. show him what he's missing.
RoTLnFGZaa	well ima girl. and when i'm with my girlfriends, its fun to do the sandwich. lol. i'm not skanky as much as it jst sounded.  and no, its a turn off when a guys trying to grind on u.  lol, i know that sounds odd. i'm not lesbian at all. I just prefer dancin' with my chicks.
YV4F9grnaa	Start by saying hi, and get into a deep conversation. When you're about to leave, ask her to the movies or to your house. In the middle OR the end, say something like, "We've been friends for some time now... and... *blah blah blah blah private conversation* ..... would.. you go out with me..?"    But don't be too sure that she'll say yes...

There are other girls out there...|`|aeb6a9eccc02ea073c914dc6ce0edcaaaa	i probably wouldnt because you'll most likely end up breaking up with her in teh end. that could end up terribly becuase her brother might not like that becuase you hurt her...|`|hA6JDWsFaa	i wouldn't. hes your friend.|`|jxseTHg7aa	ask him what he feels about it if he is okay with it then go for it|`|40qTdKuPaa	All you have to do is ask him if you can. Its his sister, and if you want to keep his as a friend, you need to tell him you genuinely like her, not just for sex or anything, and if he feels you really like her he will be okay with it. Hope this helps.|`|gSdSRceRaa	The two (your friend and his sister) are mutually exclusive. In other words, one has nothing to do with the other. If you like her, ask her out. If she accepts and that affects your friendship, than he was never your friend.

Maybe your bestfriend will be cool with it all? Or maybe he will find it completley ab-normal.    My opinion -  Talk to your bestfreind about it first, basically ask his permission.  Dating her can also ruin a friendship, if your willing to lose a bestfriend over his sister, then so be it.    (Friends are forever)  ? DEEEE|`|PmRbUgMoaa	Ask your friend. I know for girls its not cool to do without asking i dont know about guys though.|`|iEVwHmchaa	no u shdnt. i shud|`|F1l7MBsOaa	no.only if u ask ur friend if he wuld mind.|`|y0SCzMJiaa	omg no my bro once dated my bff and i just wanted top run away and hide|`|qJVPthdvaa	well i really think you should ask first cause from the girls point of view i had experience with this before...  one of my brothers friends liked me and before asking me out he said he talked to my brother then after he saw how my brother felt about it he asked me out    other than that i wouldnt recommend it if your friend doesnt like the idea|`|hjvwMgKoaa	Ummm....I have a brother that is about a year older than me and we are both in highschool right now. I think that you should ask your best friend whether it would be alright first. because if hes not okay with it it could damage your friendship with him and it would make it so there is more fighting between the sibs....I have liked some of my brothers friends and I know that some of them have liked me too, but none of them have ever asked me out before. just ask your friend, and remember dont lose your friendship with your bestfriend over a girl, other girls will come around. and if your friend says that it would be okay then go for it!

XwVDlhsSaa	You've already explained pretty well that he does not treat you well. Do not take him back. At 32, and after 2.5 years, he should be mature enough to make up his mind. He won't take you to meet his family or on vacation. Come on, he is old enough to not act like he's in high school. I think he's using you. Look at it this way; you're 28 and you want to marry this man. He says he loves you but you've never met his family, he doesn't come to see you, and he lives and hour away from you. Maybe you started out in a good relationship, but it's changed into something else. The man you love is not there anymore. You need to cut him loose and find someone who can appreciate you and treat you like you're worth it. It's not easy and will take time, but it's worth it.

aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	I don't know - but how about concentrating on your education so you'll get into a great colleage and find a wonderful career instead?
VHR2Ff8Caa	When guys are hurt (emotionally) they go quiet. They avoid confrontation. He's probably just afraid. I'm sure if you spend some time explaining to him what REALLY happened, that he'd eventually take the time to listen. Now, if he refuses to listen, he must not trust you enough. Or, not to the extent that is necessary in a working relationship. If that is the case, then I'd say let him go, no matter how much it hurts. I assure you, you can always find someone you love just as much. Maybe not for the same reasons, but it'd still be love. Good luck. :)|`|nCrbKAuzaa	wow.. that's pretty hard my dear.. anyway if you cant approach to him because his friends were their and you cant even talk to him on the phone because he seemed dont listen why wont you try this..    let him have his time first, maybe he just needed time to think about you and the statements that his friend gave him. and before doing such actions, think first and try to refelct everthing. then if you're mind is already clear and if you feel that it's already time well why wont you approach him again and try to talk to him, if he still not willing to talk to you well, try to send him email or letter where you wrote down all yor feelings..    if he still dont want to see you nor talk to you, well just moved on and respect his decision..    because you know what he seemed to like you he got hurt because of the news he've heard from his friend..|`|wS1JDr3Zaa	tell him whats up   I have the same problem with a girl but shes pretty well locked up and one of her friends ruined it for me.|`|GFZvKx8caa	find him when he is alone,  & if you cant just go up to him when all his friends are around & say it so they all here tell him "we need to talk"|`|Ac9AzRHRaa	just tell him it's not true, and prove to him realize that you really are into him, and just him    in person would be best, just ask him if you could talk to him for a sec  if not, i dont think the phone would be bad|`|O9jrkjgraa	You need to walk up to him and say "can we talk in private?"

6QIpltVyaa	well people like him will never listen even if you do embarrasse him 10times more...more anger would probably build up and it might blow up between you guys...the best thing to do is to be very firm take him to the side and tell him to stop now or else you will not deal with this anymore, its not funny and that he needs to stop...if he doesn't get it..and keeps doing his stupid acts..you need intervention (a person that is both respected and authoritative to intervene)...he looks like a bully not a friend...|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	when he calls u something yell loudly "what? you have herpes!?"    lol, it will leave people wondering whether or not its true but they won't be able to know for sure x]|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	You try to ignore him, I found out that that`s the best insult one can get, cause nobody like to play invisible. If you try just once, to talk to the guy/girl next to him but not looking at him at all, like he isn`t there...   You see when you feed the dog, the dog will be at your door, if you ignore the dog, then itll go away...  He`s seeking attention and if you feed back,,he`s getting attention...So simple.. Ignore the guy, don`t even see him and don`t listen..try to do it and tell us your results---|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Why not just tell him, he is over the line, and it bothers you?    And if he continues, you won't talk to him anymore......|`|AA10106538	he teases you because he really likes you.. teasing is his way of paying attention to you. he is too nervous to be serious.  tell him , I know you just love me, but are too shy to talk to me normally.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Don't even encourage him, just move your seat. Either he'll apologize and then you'll know if he likes you or he'll find someone else to bother and you'll know he's just a jerk.|`|49cd07e243bf1a36eb0e0431031d11d6aa	**** off lol that should tell him u mean business and why is he teasing u? guys dont that unless he likes u or hes homo|`|6qNHQ3k3aa	if hes jewish talk about hitler cause hes got blonde hair n blue eyes|`|A7r8xX7saa	"Your penis is so small if you raped a rat it wouldn't notice."|`|LzWGkzSCaa	1. why do you keeping talkin about him are you mad? do you like him? i always thought you were gay.  2. dont be mad because a girl dont like you.  thats all i have but yea good luck and forget what he says.|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Umm make a joke about him playing with balls in the water    Or if he has a girlfriend in class ask him how its going with his gf and then ask him what his cousins name is    Or the most devestating way to get at us is to cry.. that will get others on ur side and embarass him

I shoveled snow the other day, and my back hurts.  Doesn't mean I'm pregnant.|`|ta0858eQaa	Unless she is 8 weeks pregnant and never noticed it.  Then I would say maybe she pulled a muscle in her back.  That is my theory.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	back pains is a symptom to getting her period. yes she could have had it 2weeks before but its not impossible for her to get it again..if she has a irregular cycle.    she should go to a gynecologist and find out for sure|`|cl1pJK38aa	She shouldn't be pregnant if she was on the pill and you used a condom.  As a matter of fact, I guarantee that she's not.  Maybe it's just a fluke.|`|XksxhbX6aa	maybe you boned her so hard you hurt her?|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Plenty of reasons someone's back can hurt, dont sweat it. Have her drink (this is most common thing) plenty of water. If it persists for a week or 2 check it out w/ doctor perhaps|`|XouJ5QB4aa	i doubt shes pregnant,  pregnant women get back pains when further along, like 5-9 months,  you would notice by her expanding tummy by now.  maybe shes sleeping on it wrong?  or your sex is too rough?  could be a number of things.|`|c32MJwDJaa	she cant be pregnant if u used a condom  but it could be a late reaction to her period|`|UuxIJztRaa	dude ur thrusting to hard|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	Funny Guy response...  "Sounds like you laid the pipe to deep"lol  ....but really, doesn't sound like a reason for concern.  If you just can't stand it, go back to where you bought the condoms and close by there will be a pregnancy test.
9RajlJpRaa	you are in hs? then you should have fun while you can- all this will be meaningless when you get older. i would just be friends until she decides she wants to get back together. until then, just be her friend- not with benifits- and date other people. that would make her true feelings about you show. if she gets jealoous- she likes you. if she moves on- it wasnt meant to be. Good luck! and stay drug free!! good for u!|`|5LEE91CGaa	wow is all i got|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	Umm, wow. She sounds like she has some personal issues concerning dating and stuff. Therefore you can figure out what exactly it is that she's so worried she may screw up the relationship...like HOW. Hear her out and understand where she is coming from. Then you can give her some space to think about things, and if she comes back to you then she's a keeper, if not, she's flimsy.|`|Swlu2Hlkaa	True love needs and is usually tested.  Let her go, if she comes back then it's true love ... and if she doesn't then you know that you almost broke your heart over something that isn't true.

97b151f8fc2f58bf168eccca0210732daa	The best advice for you especially if you don't want to lose her is to start doing things for yourself or better yet when she does stuff for you get up and join in (help her help you). when you see her always thank her for the things she does for you tell her how much you appreciate it. Also if you can start doing things for her whether its taking her to dinner or doing he r dirty laundry without her having to ask that would be a great jump in the right direction.

I would never in a million years do that unless he was sick.  sounds like she is a slave.    just make sure she wants to do this.  and not because she thinks she has to too keep you.|`|bcad604e62dea813388e5bc906b83e07aa	the very fact you want have nice relationship with your partner shows, that you love her, and she doing everything for you means that she has endless love for you. just love her, with all that you are, and share with with her,   Jesus says "love one another as I have loved you" HE also set an example HE gave HIS life for us. that is the best relationship;|`|AA11818745	open ur eyes, open ur mind, open ur heart, open ur life to her

c92280789359b92917d10b08ed8ec259aa	Bonjour!    Le mariage n'est pas une fatalit! ;-)  Si l'amour est l, le fait de se marier ne changera rien  sa force. Ce n'est qu'un bout de papier qu'on signe...  Aprs videmment, il faut entretenir l'amour, la relation qu'on a avec celui ou celle qu'on aime. Et cela qu'on soit mari ou pas.  L'amour-passion du dbut d'une relation peut passer  un amour tendresse,  une complicit trs forte, une comprhension de l'autre, une fusion.  Si c'est la passion que tu veux garder, il faut y travailler et renouveler ses attentions envers l'tre aim. Se faire plaisir, lui faire plaisir au fil des jours.   Et communiquer. Surtout, n'oubliez pas de communiquer. Une relation ne peut se construire dans le silence. La communication vous aidera  vous rapprocher,  tablir cette complicit.  N'hsitez pas  vous confier l'un  l'autre. A devenir le meilleur ami de l'autre.    Voil mes conseils en tout cas.     Bisous et plein d'amour pour toi! ;-)|`|0dcc5b1f8d4c465c6dc96f368d86ea4caa	Contrairement  ce que pense les gens en gnral ,je ne crois pas du tout que le MARIAGE soit " un tue l'amour".  Je conseille aux personnes maris de ne pas rclamer plus de droit  vis  vis de l'autre,aprs le mariage ;Il faut rester sois mme et radiquer toute forme de conflit  et surtout ne jamais faire mnage avec la routine.Rien n'est jamais acquis mme aprs le mariage!!!.Il n'y a pas de recette miracle .vitez d'tre trop imaginatif juste aprs le mariage vous risquez d'tre  cour d'ide et cela risquerez de vous irriter.  Enfin Soyez  l'coute des battements de son coeur,aprs tout l'amour ne se commande pas ,mariage ou pas l'amour peut s'en aller  n'importe quel moment.  Bon courage.|`|e35d01ee46b62c404948b47a2161f186aa	Avec de l'coute, de la simplicit, de l'humour, de l'nergie et de la patience.

Mais si t'as peur que ta/ton compagne/on ne t'aime plus apres le mariage et bien.. ne te maries pas! ^^|`|ebe4121e37c17dd155bc3303d4a04496aa	avec beaucoup de comprhension, de concessions. Pour cela, il faut dialoguer.  Certains dfauts qui paraissent bnins au dbut peuvent devenir des montagnes avec les annes. Il faut bien mettre les choses au clair ds le dbut, et si cette tape parait difficile, ce sera pire dans 10 ans.  Le dialogue, il n'y a que ?a qui marche, changer ses ides, partager ce qu'on ressent...  Et si l'autre reste sourd, dans 10 ans ce sera pire.  Donc tout se joue au moment o tu fais le choix de " L'autre" avec qui tu partageras ta vie.  Prendre le temps de se connaitre, de se poser les bonnes questions pour savoir ce qui nous attire chez " L'autre".|`|43c0fdd23c8a1ee414fb9ba35cbacf84aa	en se fesant plaisir au maximum!|`|fdf8159d78d8432938a9b1e7dec97f02aa	*tre sincre avec l'autre  *partager les bons et les mauvais moments pour chacun  *faire plaisir et se faire plaisir  *organiser des petites fetes de couple  *changer les lieux de divertissements|`|89c4b0b78fe824bbc409377a1d35baf1aa	faut avoir l'esprit cratif, bcp d'imagination..car l'ennui et l'habitude risque de s'installer, et l c'est l'impasse dans cette vie rien ne dure, mme l'amour est mme prouv chimiquement que l'amour ne dure que 3 ans, aprs c'est l'habitude et la passion   bonne chance|`|a51d31beac9c5fa208ad9343b6c0422eaa	te marie pas !|`|df366618b469d25a8cddada9d28305f7aa	On a trop tendance  penser le mariage comme une finalit.

Je crois qu'il vaut mieux, en tous les cas, chercher une ide qui lui fasse plaisir  lui ( toi aussi, bien-s?r) mais pas forcment une ide tourne exclusivement vers toi, si tu vois ce que je veux dire, l'amour ne doit pas tre narcissique!

1de3dac6e002835d9c8ef072a51f5596aa	If you are a more relaxed person than her, try to spend some more time with her and be sure that this will definitely have a very positive impact on her. What I mean is that she will start seeing the world with your eyes, too. Everybody tends to borrow some elements from the personality of people with whom they spend a long time. Especially if she trusts you or if you can help her start trusting you, youll most probably become the sunshine in her worries. Sometimes people worry too much because they are in a very difficult period of their lives or because they have to fight for everything alone. It doesnt necessary mean that she is having family problems, because that would most probably lead to other types of reactions. Perhaps she is a very considerate person towards other peoples feelings or maybe she is trying to achieve some really crucial things in her life at this point and while trying to stay focused on one section of her life, without realizing it, she is carrying these worries to other sections of her life, too. As soon as the tension goes away, her tendency to worry too much will also go away. Good luck my friend! You seem to like her a lot since you care about stg like that. I think you will have the luck I wished you.|`|ff19d269648d065077b673fe489657c8aa	you cant.....thats her deal, and dont spend 10 years of relationships finding that out.|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	just try to hep her with the things she worries about  if you can i know some things yoiu cant  but you can at least be there for her  to talk about whats bothering her and show you care that can mean a great deal!|`|288b841be969b73799ab855754b668a2aa	ask her what she worries about because she might be having family issues or something like that that your not seeing and the only way you might find out is asking her instead of she telling you about 2 months later. Also if you ask her, it will show her that you care about whatever she is worrying about.|`|3aefe73bd1a27e6a0cc5b756b7074319aa	Well i can tell you for sure, she is trying very hard to get over worrying so much.

Disle a tu novio que quieres hablar con el. Y explicale que te escuche y que no quieres que te interumpa que luego el te hagas las preguntas que sea que tu se las contestaras. Empieza a explicarle que alguien hace mucho tiempo a tras tu te ilucionastes sola con esa persona pero que jamas el nunca te pelo y que nunca hubo nada pero ahora que estan ustedes junto y eres feliz con el,esa persona se te declaro pero que tu le dijistes que no, porque tu quieres tu novio y jamas le seria infiel. cuando termines de explicar todo lo que sabes entonces le dices que no quiere que el pelee con esa persona porq. tu amas a tu novio no a ese otro muchacho y le dices quien es. Le aclara que tu se lo dices porque entre ustedes no puede haber secretos, y que tu quiere hablar con tu cu?ado frente a tu novio y le dices que tu no quieres nada con el que el es eso tu cu?ado.Termina con ese asunto antes de que ese cu?ado tuyo te eche a perder lo lindo que tinene con tu novio de 2 a?os. Porque para mi es un patan y puede ser capas de hacer o decir algo que te perjudique pues si el se atrevio a declarasete es capaz de cualquier cosa sabiendo que eres su cu?ada y cuidate no vayas mucho a la casa de tu novio a menos que el te vaya a buscar, pues llegas un dia sola a la casa de tu novio y el no esta y quien esta es tu cu?ado cuidado con lo que puede invenar tu cu?ado para que tu novio te deje. hay muchos seres egoitas y no seria el primero que haga algo asi.

Un dia hablando le pregunte:  No te dio miedo de dejarme entrar a tu casa sin nisiquiera conocerme antes?  ellla me dijo:yo te conocia con lo poco que hablamos me di cuenta de que eras una persona muy buena y hermosa por eso te invite a mi casa,no tenia miedo.

No es malo  de  ninguna manera pero lo malo es no razonar  y no darle a las cosas  la ubicacion que  ellas tienen.   Y digo  no es malo , porque   si la conoces personalmente  podria darse   el gran amor de tu vida,  pero tambien podria ser una desilusion.   Ten la cabeza  fria  y  razona,  pero trata de  darte la oportunidad de conocerla,  y preparate a  ser observador  imparcial .  Lo mas seguro  es que el amor prevalesca y que les traiga  gran felicidad, cuando se conoscan.

Lo que si, es que hay que sentirse seguro de con quien se esta haciendo, y no tener dudas. si te sientes exitada en el preambulo, pero no muy segora de que quieras llegar al sexo, lo mejor es detenerte, porque ni lo vas a disfrutar. Preparate mentalmente y te repito, hazte a la idea de que el sexo es algo malo, es solo un tabu religioso, eso si, quidate, y obligalo a que se cuide.

If you want to keep both friends, I wouldn't take a side. Step back from the fight.

No matter what you do sooner or later one or both will do the same back stabbing to you.  The best thing you can do is tell them both together how you feel about the behavior that's been displayed without pointing a finger or using names and leave it up to them as to where it goes.  Be sure you state to them that you won't be a part of it again or now and if it starts again there is a parting of ways.
Gkw0OpW4aa	This is really hard i know.I have 4 uncles and they have all done drugs adn they all have a really bad drinking problem. And when i was 12 i found pot in my uncles basement.So i kind of know how youare feeling because my uncle is 23 and he still lives with my grandma and he dilivers pizza and he did heroine and my mom and other unle had to bail him out of jail.And he acts like a 15 year-old he comes home at 9:00 a.m after partying all night and just tries to come hang-out with me and i won't let him because i know that he is drunk nad im afraid what he will do and idk if he is still doing drugs but i jsut dont want to be with him.But I know this is probably really really hard for you but you have to try to talk to him and try to get him help!He needs your love?.And your a family you have to stick together that is what family is for.And Your sister nad your mom our just trying to help him ((ATLEAST THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE))But i understand how upset you are!My other uncle was going to jail when he was 15 ffrom drinking under age and breaking into peoples houses and doing drugs and i grew up with that and im sorry that that is how you are too!But you have to try to help try to talk to your grandma and tell her to tell your brother that she will give him like $200 and he better use it wisely like trying to get help nad if he doesnt that she will kick him out untill he does get help.And for you you just need to try to think of good things and how if he gets help you can have your real brother back!And you wont have to deal with that old crapy worthless brother anymore!And please let me know how everything works out...|`|GPFnaKXcaa	All I'd like to say is, try to spend less time judging your brother and try to spend more time with him. Just hang out with him,  help him with something, or just share a soda. Because when he dies, you'll suddenly realize that no matter what happens, he was/is/will be your brother, the one and only, and you won't be able to see him again, no matter what you do.   Dead people can't hear our begs for forgiveness. That's why's important to do what's right while the people we care about are still alive.  I mean, honestly. Wouldn't you hate your brother a little less if you could make him stop taking drugs? But since you can't force him to stop, it's easier to convince yourself that you hate him, so if you hate him, you won't have to worry about what happens to him...   Anyhow, I'd suggest you therapy. Not for your brother, but for yourself. Some things we can't change, and so we must learn to live with them. Other's must live their own life, and you must live yours. Live it in a way that makes you proud, always.|`|4e7bea630da81cb077ea42ca9591e26eaa	turn him in to your local agency on aging? i think that is what it's called. they investigate people who take advantage of the elderly. he should not be allowed to do that to your Grandmother!! that is awful. area agency on aging, there's the name, and you do not have to tell them who you are, or you can tell them who you are and have them keep it confidential. they cannot tell who made the report if you ask them not to,but they will be more apt to listen to you being family.|`|91df4122b574ac0809bd6dd937bca53faa	I think first think you should do is to take him to a rehabiliation centre or a psycharist so that you could make him realize his responsibility towards his family as well make him realize that he is becoming a burden to a family...as far as your mother is concerned you try to tell her that she cannot be so liberal with a son who is so careless and has no sense of responsibility...I think first you have to take your mother in your side because i think she is giving him unwanted praise to do wrong things in life...as for your grandmother you have to see to it that he never goes to her for money...instead tell him that nobody will give you money till you earn yourself....or till you become a responsible person....and one more thing i would tell you to do is to KEEP HIM AWAY FROM BAD COMPANY...I think that will have more influence on him...YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAVE TO TAKE A BOLD STEP IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM REALIZE HIS RESPONSIBILITY.|`|3a3e83cdd82c6f01cb6edf265e614ddbaa	gee, that's a tough one.     i understand where you're coming from. i grew up with a sister who sucked up just about everything she can without caring about the rest of us. i wouldn't say that i hate her, just hate what she does to the rest of us and angry that my parents take her side most of the time.    however, you have anger issues and you seem to be filled with hatred. you'll probably end up with an abusive relationship, either the giver or receiver of abuse (although quite frankly more of a giver), and spend a life time judging people. from your description of your father, i'm guessing that's your source of your personality.     it's one thing to dislike or even hate someone, but it's another to want them, especially your own sibling, dead or locked up in jail forever. i suppose you are very angry at what your brother has done to you. but rather than fill yourself with anger and hatred, why don't you try a bit of understanding and kindness. be supportive. help him out as much as you can to break free from the horrible cycle. don't let him take advantage of you or anything and distance yourself as much as possible, because reality of it is that he'll take every advantage that he can to fix his need for drugs. but know that he's not doing it on purpose, he has an addiction problem. filling yourself up with anger and hatred only hurts you and makes you a miserable person.     good luck with your situation. hope things work out for you.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	Get off ur judgmental ride &make a difference.

As my brother is a drug addict too.  However, you will never understand what your mother is feeling towards her son... You will never know until you have your own children, how absolutely emotionally devastating for a mother to see her child be so sick with this disease.  She wants to help so much, and wants to see him taken care of.   Its too hard for her to let him go, so that he learns his own lessons.    The disappointment and the sadness your whole family feels is very strong, just everyone deals with it differently.  Your dad doesnt hate him, he is sad in his own manly way, and chooses to disconnect from him, so he doesnt watch him kill himself.    They dont give you the attention, because this sadness and heartbreak is being focused on your brother.    You are a high sense of relief to your parents. They just dont express it, because again they are too torn up by your brother.    I think you need to turn your hate into compassion, and love your parents and other family (show them you love them) even though you dont like the way they are handling your brother.  They do this because they love their son/brother.  When you have a child, you will understand that unconditional love.  Your sister does need to get a spine and start thinking about the kids. Things will change with her I suspect, when those babies come into the world, and her husband will eventually have something to say about the drug addict coming around.    You have my sympathy, but you need to have compassion.    PS and to the person who recommends puting him into a rehab???? Sorry hon, it doesnt work like that. They only go to rehab when they decide, and that happens usually after they have hit bottom and lost everything. That will never happen until the family shows "tough love" and disconnects themselves with him, and stop enabling his behavoirs by giving him money and letting him live with them and visiting with them.

Other than that, tough it out. Your life isn't over. If you're failing in school, study harder. Moving won't fix that.|`|KwNpyp3saa	If this is a medical condition diagnosed by YOUR doctor then your parents should definitely do something about it. If not, then go see a doctor.

How are they going to pay living expenses without a job?

pz1OdJoPaa	Aww you will be feeling awful eh, but really 11 weeks out of your relationship is not long at all. Tell him your fears and get and give reassurance before he goes, but try not to be too heavy, let him know how much you will miss him and cant wait till hes home again but make sure you encourage him to have a fantastic time, dont make him feel hes doing something terrible by going away.When hes gone keep yourself busy, catch up with all the things you have been putting off, make the most of friends and family, and when you contact him and he hears how you are happy, encouraging and also happy for him to have this time...trust me he will think all the more of you when he does get back!|`|iLuc1xyAaa	There is a old saying "Distance makes the heart grow fonder" I would tell him how you feel, let him know that you are going to miss him but you fully support him going away. Let him know you want to stay in contact and that if he wants to keep your relationship on going, you will wait for him faithfully. I know you feel lost right now, but you don't want him going away without him knowing how you feel, it is better to tell him this sooner than later.<br>  Good luck to you and keep your head high.<br>  x|`|k8HVgVdnaa	no you are not over reacting. just tell him how you feel and he wont dump you if love is between you guys and not space.|`|e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	just talk to him and tell him how you feel. stay in contact with him while he is gone.|`|G0MVoleoaa	keep in contact with him and be 'very' good.<br>  im sure you will be really looking forward to seeing him after this, it will be like all new and weird...|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	We are always insecure when we love someone. He can't dump you if you guys aren't together and he doesn't know how you feel. Just tell him your feelings before he leaves. Let him know that you will miss him and you will be thinking of him and that you care very much. Stop thinking you're not good enough because that's BS. You have to put your heart out there even if it is risky. Show him your heart, especially if you think he may feel the same way.

3pcwIUBlaa	i do not think its sounds desperate. it sounds as if you are handling the situation very well and that you want the best for your child. if he thinks that it sounds desperate just talk to him and let him know that that was not your intention but that you just want the best in the situation. i wish u the best of luck!!! hope this helped:D|`|tuXBPrjsaa	i completely agree with you!<br>  <br>  you sound very smart.<br>  <br>  and if you were smarter you would have an abortion or put this baby up for adoption.<br>  <br>  do NOT depend on this guy by any means.|`|B1COLthhaa	Don't force him to get married. He doesn't want to be with you right now but it's probably out of anger. Having a baby on the way is a huge responsibility and could scare anyone into trying to run away. Make him be a part of the baby's life even though you both are not going to be together, at least he will still be there in your life and maybe he will want something more again. Until then don't sound like you can't live without him. Everything you tell him, make it in the best interest of the baby. This will show how mature you are and he will realize his love for you sooner or later. =]|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	Say what you feel. But, if he is making excuses to get out of the responsibility of you and a baby, maybe he isn't even worth writing to or talking to anymore. He should be there for his family.

I have lost a grandpa to cancer and that turned my life and the way I think upside down. I suggest praying, for God is the great comforter. Talk to him right now and you will see what I mean. he loves you very much and wants to get to know you, he will take your problems away if you just put your trust in him and repent.|`|d1bfcc93f873f4006f30763c1b22348eaa	gurl i feel you. i say in mississippi and it's so boring and i have family member leaving 1 by 1 e-mail me at :smartbeans06@yahoo.com|`|dfff2f3e0eafff892efc17b44309b156aa	I really don't know how to begin. All I can say is I can relate. My little brother got run over by a car two years ago and my cousin was recently in a fatal accident. Our family has been going through some rough times. I'v efound it hard to focus in school. I'm not one to preach, but its not other people my family turned to help for. It was our church and God. He brought my brother back, hurt but alive, my cousin was the only one in the crash not dead, and my sisters' baby made it through her first few premature weeks. Please don't give up, once you've hit the bottom, the only place you can go is up. Use your pain, and put it into your sport, don't let it go to waste. dedicate yourself to take your mind off your loss. And most importantly... pray. Please and if you're not religious, its not hard, just talk. State your troubles and ask for help. God may not answer you in the way you think, but he will be there. I will also pray for you. People are always there for you. God Bless You,

vcgz0EaYaa	let him go. He's not ready for a relationship and you need somone who really cares about you. Not someone who only asks what's wrong when he thinks it will mean losing you if he doesn't. He should be able to tell when somethings up without you having to spell it out for him in an e-mail.

0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	As a friend you should be honest with him, but he'll probably not appreciate you telling him that he's trapped and can't see it.  That's like saying he can't take care of himself and doesn't know what's good for him.  Simply have an honest talk with him, tell him that his girlfriend doesn't want you around him and you don't want to come between the two of them, so you're going to hang out with him less for a while, but you're there for him if he needs you.  Don't expect him to break up with her right away and don't make him feel guilty.  Just be a friend, put his needs before your own and wait it out.|`|1271e30232efb897a72c28750c8c070caa	I dont think there is really much you can do if he cant see it then there isnt really much you can do to bring it to his attention if she is that bad he will see it sooner or later....|`|d0737ef8f11da887c8ae5b3067f7ff97aa	what a stupid girl ur bestfriend has...  if she`s so pretty,she doesn`t have to get jealous and get angry with u.  i think it`s better if u don`t hang out with ur bestfriend becoz i think there`ll be a war between u and his girl.just wait after they broke up|`|d7e2049429794983ca52bd819348418eaa	Honesty is all a person can ever offer another.|`|d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	This is tough question because on one hand if you tell him you run the risk of it getting back to her which will cause some fiction between them which may also have you cut off as a friend if she insists on having you not around.    (I know this can happen with both genders in a case when either it's the guy or girl that is controlling.)  If both your friends are both close chances are they will talk and things slip out.  Now if this guy friend is able to keep a confidence then I would tell him otherwise it could back fire for you.      If you know some of his other friends and talk to them to see if they are on the same wave length as you.  If you can?  That's what I would do in this kinda of situation.   If two people are a witness about a situation like this then it's more possible he will listen then if it's just you against her.    I would think about it before you jump in and decide what to do. Another thing is if he does listen to you and remains your friend that would mean that he does value your opinion to have you stick around.    I would say do what you consider to be the best because any one of us can give you advise but you are the one who has to decide what's best for you to do.

a05e6a3122100a4349fd2a1e175820a4aa	Haha, it sounds like she's both. Obviously, a flirt is someone who flirts with everyone. And a tease goes a little bit further by acting a bit more interested, then pulling back.     However in your situation I think she might have meant that the flirting was more just joking around...    But watch out, she may be crushing on you! ;D Hahah. Saying that she was only teasing may be her way of sidestepping her REAL answer- she was flirting because she LIKES you!    Peace and good luck!|`|3add3b8b87e3da83233006637f392cf5aa	they're pretty much the same thing, though a tease more like teasing...|`|aee8316837d471fcec00e37d6053028faa	she's obviously got you pinned, if your asking about it on here... the difference between the two is if you like what she's doing or not and my guess would be that you do or you wouldn't keep talking to her...|`|fe6f5b91b13167453d55847831a766c1aa	Flirt and tease are just synonyms.|`|0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	flirting = teasing someone with the intention of making them more aware of you in a sexual/relationship sense.
mK35PnJUaa	Lamento decirte que no te ama, o la clase de amor que te ofrece no es la que uno espera de la pareja que lo ser para toda la vida.

No dudo que la situecion por la que estas atravesando es de la mas dificil pero recuerda que el tambien tubo en algun momento que hacerse a la idea que vos no estarias mas. tambien ten en cuenta que el debe seguir viviendo su vida. dejalo ir. y preocupate solo por recuperarte. suerte|`|Bol3hNEaaa	no vale la pena hacerse da?o yo poco apoco y con consejos que me han dado me doy cuenta que una persona que te hace da?o no merece estar a tu lado cuidate ok|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	?queeeeeeeeeeee?????? creo que ERES UNA CHAVA MUY FUERTE Y MUY VALIOSA para seguir pensando en ese tipo, quizs el tenia miedo pero creo que cuando amas a una persona siempre estas ahi,es dificil prque imagino que si lo quieres, y se que el tambien  a ti pero no lo suficiente, todos tenemos errores pero la verdad creo que tu mereces alguien mejor que el, y te aseguro que mil chavos qusieran encontrar a alguien tan especial como tu, piensa en lo que a ti te haga ser ms feliz pero la verdad creo que tu felicidad no es con el, reflexionalo pero creo que tendras una vida muy hermosa que dios te cuidara mucho y que encontraras a alguien tan lindo y valioso como  tu, cuidate mucho y la verdadesechavo no vale la pena|`|xO17S8jcaa	yo siento que si te ama pero desgraciadamente la noticia de tu enfermedad creo yo lo conmociono mucho, ahora el esta confundido pues se ve envuelto en tomar la desicion de seguir a tu lado o de buscar por otros lados el amor.    talvez si te ama, pero desgraciadamente en este caso lo principal no es el amor, sino el apego y el compromiso de el para estar contigo, el cual no se vio pues te abandono en los momentos que mas lo necesitabas a su lado y pero aun, no te abandono por motivos que tuvieran una justificacion sino que incluso estaba saliendo con otras mujeres.    estuvo bien que lo perdonaras pues quienes somos nosotros como para no perdonar, pero creo yo, tengo la ideologia de que, cuando se perdona a alguien es porque la persona promete no volver a cometer esos errores, y resulta que ya que te pide matrimonio, te confiesa que sigue saliendo con otra y que peor aun te pide que aun asi se casen.    no amiga no cometas un error tan grave de casarte con el, si realmente te amara, estaria contigo, a tu lado, protegiendote y amandote y ademas te seria fiel.    te felicito por salir adelante y por no darte vencida en esta lucha entre estar vivo y estar muerto, me alegra que estes mejor y que  sigas adelante, pero si, te aconsejo que no te cases con el, una persona asi es mejor tenerla de lejos.    cuidate y se paciente, ya llegara una persona que si sepa valorar la gran mujer fuerte,luchona y emprendedora que eres ;)    suerte y hechale todas las ganas del mundo a lo que venga ;)|`|eMR0c492aa	Amiga, creo que si siente algo por vos, pero no creo que sea amor; el amor es incondicional.

F94EjhTdaa	I did that a week ago! LOL! Yea, but the guy I said it to was a JERK! He thought he was a pimp! He was ugly as I dont know what! But talk to him and say "There are more girls out there, don't give up OK?" That will make his day!!!|`|AA10698098	Tell him you do have a boyfriend and your stupid friend thought she was being funny.|`|d82289ab3b606bd70224818e537392ecaa	Ofcourse! It's easier to let someone down that way. Too bad your loud mouth friend ruined it!|`|nJSNAYIJaa	Yes I have done that. And I really hurt the guy that liked me. Just a hint of advice: don't do that again. lol. Its really not good. I feel guilty for doing that to this guy that liked me. And I'm never gonna do that again. And if you do end up doing that again, when you realize what a terrible thing you have done, go to the guy that likes you, and come straight and honest with him.|`|AA11251265	i've done that alot, but never felt bad about it.|`|572143b6a8736c59235a0606e0b5f0b1aa	Yes I've lied to more than one guy.  I can't say I'm proud of that fact.  Sometimes though its like ling by omission.  Some things are better left unsaid.  I did it thinking that I was sparing his feelings.  You can't take it back so you may as well accept it and just move on.  Good luck.|`|Ahw9m7yXaa	dont masterdate|`|AA11235314	Yes, and a lot of girls do that to avoid conflict, they are trying to be nice and not hurt the guys feelings by making up a reason for not accepting the offer, most guys my age have already realized that it is a nice way of rejecting them and move on.  You can't help that that guy found out but in the future it might be best to say something like "I am really not ready for a relationship right now" of course that doesn't do any good if he see some guy with his arm over your shoulder the next day at lunch.  But at least it is more difficult to get caught lying about it.|`|uMvM8V1Taa	It's always better to just tell the truth. if you arent interested in a guy that asks you out then just say you arent interested. lying just complicates matters in any sitation. besides, the guy you turn down may become a good friend someday, but most likely they wont even bother being a friend if you have lied to them. just tell the truth, it's not like they will be mad a you for being honest. honesty seems like a thing of the past, for both men and women. maybe its time honesty made a comeback :). but then, thats just my opinion|`|MTtOFtGbaa	Why didn't you just tell him you didn't like him in that way, but as a friend.  Now he's heart broken, probably went and cried somewhere.  Your friends did the right thing by busting you out.  Who wants a ruthless girl.  I hope he turns this around by spreading rumors about you.

Some people do not like to be touched. And the fact that your friend knew the kid didn't like what she was doing and did it anyway makes her all the way wrong! She should be embarassed of herself and hopefully she'll learn a meaningful lesson about putting her hands where they don't belong!|`|AA11097023	Sounds like there are some control/power issues going on.|`|37d43398649f52be8054c01ecb178ba1aa	I wouldn't call it cruel or abnormal, but your friend just didn't know when ot stop.

And he doesnt like you tough luck.    Girls ( and some guys to )  Need to understand that we CANNOT change people because we want them to be different. The only person who can change him is him. He has to want to change. If he doesn't like you then he doesn't like you.    Also School dances are a conspiracy of the government and don't actually exist you just think you do.|`|8ed7fc32be357df1555f1b6d2a1130b2aa	Well, first we gotta know for sure that you're even interested in the first place. That means we don't want any stupid, silly, time-wasting head games. Second, you have to find some common ground with this guy. Always listen and pay attention for if he listens back, and make sure you both get to know each other. Third, when the time is right, if he doesn't have a girl, ask him out.|`|AA12220417	sometime just having someone take an interest in me will make me start to like them or realize things about them that I never knew.

I'd quickly show you that there are some men out there who can treat you the way you want to be. You just have to be patient and one will find you. And I am willing to bet a case of your favorite drink that he'll be exactly what you are looking for, but can't seem to find.     As for your question... I'd hope so, because there are a lot of jerks out there and you have every right to be picky and only settle for the ones who meet you criteria.

J'explique ma pense:  Ce qui provoque l'amour, c'est surtout le desir, temps qu'il y'a du dsir, il y'a de l'amour. Le jour o on a fait tout ce qu'on voulait faire avec la personne (1  3ans en moyenne) l flamme s'teint. Mais nous pouvons retrouver le desir en dsirants d'autres choses, souvent inconscientes. C'est assez rare mais c'est dans ces cas l que c'est possible.    Maintenant, il faut s'assurer que c'est vraiment un amour rl qui reprend et non pas simplement une sensation de vide, que l'on voit combl grace  la personne. Car  ce stade il y'a de l'affection, mais ce n'est pas pareil que l'amour.

Croiser les jambes est loin une marque de fminit, en faite cel a avoir avec le comportement et l'humeur de la personne.

Masturbation was wrong in the ancient times because the world population is small and your sperm wasn't even given a chance to bring new lives to this world.    Now that the times had changed, I believe it is no more a sin.

Does he seem to remember little things that you've told him in past conversations?    he might just want to be a friend though. =(

You were probably the only one he danced with the whole night. He thought you and him had a brief moment while dancing and he viewed it as a way to get to know your wild expressive side, although it was just dancing to you. Dancing is sometimes correlated to pre-coitus to some, prominently in men.
d542241349693290d70dca6530a83f43aa	Because men are stupid and often don't realize they are causing other people pain.  Not all men are like this, of course, you just have to be more selective in who you choose to date.  Think about each person you've dated who has hurt you and look for common characteristics.  Then, when you're considering dating someone new, look for those characteristics in the new person.  It'll give you a better idea whether or not the new person will end up like your past relationships.    Just don't let yourself get dragged down by the same situation over and over.  You deserve better.|`|0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	You're not going to like hearing this...  people treat you the way you train them to do.  The relationships you have with the people around you, especially boyfriends, is a mirror in which you see yourself.  So if they treat you like crap, it's probably because you don't see yourself as worthy of being treated better.  Decide for yourself how you want to be treated and if they don't respect those boundaries, move on.  It's hard at first, but it's worth it.  YOU're worth it!  You'll find there's a lot of great guys out there as well.  Good luck!|`|3f23039534718ed0d80b20e016bbc81faa	You are a jerk magnet.  You are destined to be attracted to men who disrespect you.

Think of it this way' Not all ways what you are attracted to is the right thing for you. In other words you have to make up your mind what you want. Do you want to be treated right by a good guy that might not be as exciting as the bad boy with the hot body and the attitude. Always remember if you get treated bad you picked him. You can't blame every guy and say they are all bad. You picked him.|`|67b9958e3f9478dc924202f30e727a8baa	because they are many of them out there waiting for them to break up and start with them, don't worry when you get the right person your dissapointment will end|`|21d0c58cc4cd75b571646ef3438969c0aa	just like the guys in my family and close friends, they say they think girls are predictable. they think they can get any girl to fall for them. and when they do fall for them, then they think it doesnt matter what they do from there because the guys think they have the girl already. sometimes its all part of their little game. but theres always carma.|`|632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	It's because you're dating the wrong guys, boo.

Always make sure you are the one who makes the first move out.  Just as a bonus try to act like aguy for one day..as in flirt with someone and dump them for no apparent reason and see how it feels.  For the time being you need to check out your personality...how you speak, dress, the words you use, and the places you hung out....this could be where these creeps are and avoid being an easy target for them.  You can also play hard to get until you find out a guys true personality and then decide whether you will go otu or not.  trust your instincts and guts.When they scream run when they smile smile back.|`|d7e5574cb3cd0ca6d25be9230ebbe8b9aa	you've met the wrong people. and they don't deserve you. from the way you said it.  so, cheer up and i'm sure someone much better is waiting for you! =))|`|edfdf2a847115d9325f75a18fc25d844aa	Because they are all may be like you because you have lot of friends and breakup with many is it not.

They are strong, independent, assertive, confident/arrogant, and usually unpredictable. Those push the buttons of attraction in a girls psyche. She can't help it.    Girls do not generally like the guys who won't treat them like crap.  Because those guys tend to be calmer, quieter, not as exciting, predictable, reliable. Not the sort of thing which pushes the 'attraction' button in a girl.    It's a vicious circle, but there you go.|`|ca29d59d47a6da17d9a20803e85274c2aa	bc subconsciously they really hate their mothers and resent all the years that ****** told them what to do, who to date, what to wear so they DISPLACE their hate on innocent girls bc they cant tell that first woman off.

Our relationship problems often reflect our family based problems.    If this rings true, you may have some work to do on yourself and your self esteem, so that you feel that you DESERVE to be treated better.    If this doesn't ring true, well, maybe you are just trusting people that shouldn't be trusted. Try slowing the process down and only give people trust if they have proven they deserve it.    Good luck|`|ebd616c3b975b65300d21467e097cb87aa	i'm sorry to  say that men don't even know they are hurting the girls,to them it's pretty normal stuff i guess.you are meeting the wrong kind of boys.just keep it cool,always put in your mind that you are special,deserve to be treated special,and hopefully one day you mill meet that special boy who is your match.good luck!
AA11033750	If you don't like him, don't date him.. no matter what your friends or he says. You have to do what you want to do, that's the only way to be happy. And if they force you to date him, maybe you will be forced to do other things you don't want to do.. and you will regret it...  Be careful, and find a guy you like :)

WYnaBeIfaa	Well since you ASKED, I thank my personal GOD that I am not (female) on a daily basis if having sex can even be called "GIVING IT UP". LOL!  But don't worry. . . . the grown ups know what you meant. ;)    While its totally impossible to know what my mentality would be, I would like to think that I would "give it up" BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE SEX FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF IT and not  FOR ANY OTHER REASON.    If I had a daughter , I would INSIST on deffinitely teaching her to take a REALISTIC and SENSIBLE approach to sex rather than the one women everywhere seem to have.    I am 100% convinced that women use SEX for LEVERAGE (like a bargaining tool) whenever its possible or men let them get away with it.  I believe that women don't often enough have sex for the RIGHT reasons , but rather for the WRONG reasons.    -->> WRONG REASONS FOR WOMEN TO HAVE SEX:    - For approval from him or others  - So he will like her more  - So he will call again and "take her out"  - Because it beats staying home and doing "boring stuff".  - She likes the attention  - So he will say he loves her  - Just to see what its like  - Fear of not being wanted  - For jewlery or something he might buy you  - To THANK him for something he bought you  - For money  - To get a man and keep a man  - Because it creates addictive emotions within her  - To prove something to herself or anyone else  - Because she thinks sex = love and/or vice versa  - For a marriage proposal  - For a promise of some kind  - To have something to talk about with her friends  - Because there's nothing else to do  - To see if she can win over a MARRIED man  - To trap a man by getting pregnant on purpose  - To get back at her grirlfriend or make another woman jealous  - To get something OTHER than an orgasm or three.  . . . .  and the list goes on.    -->> RIGHT REASONS FOR WOMEN TO HAVE SEX:  (excluding to "have a baby" because we are talking about "giving it up" here)    - For his pleasure  - For her OWN pleasure    There are no more than TWO RIGHT REASONS TO HAVE SEX. But look at the LONG list of WRONG REASONS that women jump into bed for.  And notice how genuinely FRIGHTENING some of those reasons ARE!  And they call men "users, and pigs" when they want to have FUN, no-strings nookie?????    WOW. Brutal.    But FASCINATING. When you think about that for a second, you can't help but wonder if they HATE SEX, or they must be  LOUSY AT IT . . . . if they don't see the point in HAVING ANY unless there's something ELSE in it for them.    So having established that . . . as long as my (future) daughter is having sex for the RIGHT REASONS, I won't mind one bit when she "gives it up".      If I were a woman, I would be the same.|`|moeXy7piaa	not as much as i would  as a guy|`|NUqY8rh8aa	That is the stupidest question I have ever seen on this thing.|`|1203b7e3688ab3e61c98082d183d1586aa	Give what up?|`|8LIf2tgLaa	i wouldnt unless you want to be a barefoot and pregnant 17 year old then you find out nobody wants you anymore and your life becomes much harder
df50b667c6f3512dff6e0d3f50e4d902aa	Sometimes gay guys will be very flirtatious and become very good friends with girls. It is a safe situation for both of them-- they can have the fun of the relationship knowing it will never lead to any major commitment or hassles. Some women's 'best friends' are gay guys.  I'd suggest you casually ask him to meet you for drinks, a casual dinner with others from work, or say you have an extra ticket for something and would he like to go with you. If he is gay, he may volunteer the information at that point, not wanting to lead you on. Then you can graciously tell him you want to go with him because you like his company, not because you were looking for romance.  I don't think there is any direct way to ask that question. Many straight guys would be offended--- and it also may imply "Hey, if you haven't followed up and asked me out, you MUST be gay!" Not a way to score points with a guy you like--- whether as a friend or as a romance.  But you don't say how you will side-step the issue of not dating someone from work. Clearly if he is not gay, you are hoping to see him outside of work--|`|bd76dc143df9c5beac002480809f500eaa	You can't ask him if he's gay, especially if you like him.  If he's not, he's just going to be offended and if he is... he might not want you to know.  Just keep flirting and if you like him, let him know in ways.  Someone else will come along if he never asks you out.|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	consider the source. an ex or enemy? not trustworthy. but a friend of his? sorry honey, but its prob the truth.   gay guys tend to be very friendly because its all for fun.|`|34129e7d5c424358f428d3e3c808cfe1aa	I have trouble asking people things straight out - so you ask other questions. Like aske about his past relationships, why he's not dating anyone, where he hangs out, etc. Just talk to himand look for clues. And if the opportunity comes up just ask "So, are you gay?"|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	He's practicing on you.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	ask him out for a movie or dinner or both.or just lunch  get to talking about old girlfirends and old boyfriends (which I hate doing) but its just to find out if he has had any. or you could skip that and just get to know him better get to be friends and he may confide in you also he may not be gay and if he is it might be a faze that you can change in him. its best to start out being friends anyway. what have you got to lose? atleast you can have a good friend. good luck|`|53f1b8516e5569a512b84f4f580646b8aa	ask a friend to ask him if he likes you or if he's gay|`|OlOjdl7Laa	he might not be gay and it might just be a rumor. he might just act a little more femanine than others, but try to flirt with him too if you really like him    good luck

CnuwupbOaa	When women are in their older 20s they're mature,set, and have some idea of what they're looking for when it comes to finding love. The high school mentality are conditioned into finding partners the same age. You love the mature intelligent woman, but most of the time they're taking the well-being of their future into consideration, such as moving in together or even marriage. Some woman love compatibility where age is not an important factor. If you want to meet woman, stay active, involved, and be persistant. If she is the right woman for you, she'll look past the age difference. It's better than the major difference of younger or older.
CnuwupbOaa	One whom I'm compatible with. Therefore there is not one specific type.

What about you? You made your relationship a game in which he was mearly a pawn for you to manipulate. Maybe he got back with you to get back at you, did you ever think of that? Maybe he placed a bet with a friend w/how pathetic you were to believe you actually deserved a second chance. Hopefully he bet you were and at least got something out of this sorry excuse of a relationship.|`|uekps6Ecaa	no, u shouldnt have done tht 2 him. he mightve actually like u.
f35c51f5e331b49ab01670d8dbe59ca3aa	Having gone completely through high school and halfway through college before I ever had the nerve to ask a girl out, I can definitely relate.  Based on your attractiveness and obvious intelligence, I highly doubt that your fears will ever be realized.  However, that still doesn't give you something to talk about in those scary first moments.      Without knowing much of anything about you, I have only two pieces of advice to offer:     (1) Take the Pressure Off (TPO).  Don't begin the conversation with romance on your mind.  Just picture yourself as being friendly to another human being.  Thinking about whether you're making a good impression on Mr. Hottie is only asking for sweaty palms, and your being nervous will only make /him/ nervous, and then it all goes to The Awkward Place.  Just forget that you're looking for a relationship and focus on /this/ moment, /this/ conversation.  Because that's really all it is.  No pressure.    (2)  Exploit the Male Ego (EMO).  Get /him/ talking.  Ask questions that are likely to produce lengthy answers, such as, "How does /anyone/ hit a fastball when it's going 95 MPH?" or "Would you rather have a Corvette or a Ferrari?  Why?"  Or if he's the nerdy type, "I just don't get General Relativity and the Big Bang Theory.  Would you please explain them to me?" (haha)  Anyway, you get the idea.  Once you get him talking, you'll relax and start thinking of all kinds of things to say.  Except that by then you won't be able to get a word in edgewise. :P    Remember, TPO and EMO.  Good luck!|`|rZu7LTY6aa	I have had the low-esteem thing also, but what I did was, on my friend's recommendation, write down a list of your qualities that you believe make you appealling to other people. Let it sink in, and you will have more confidence in yourself.  Some people say that rejection is bad, but most of the time, it's actually their loss.|`|AA10745743	yes...the fear of rejection is something that has always bothered me...and still does today...its hard when ur not real sure how the answer to a ? is gonna come out...and how the person is gonna react...but u gotta look at it like dis "if there wasnt rejection in the world not everything would be perfect" b/c sometime's there's a reason behind the answer no...not everything can be answered yes...but thats the way i look at it and thats why i dont fear it as much anymore...well i hope i helped ya out! and i wish you the best of luck!!!|`|4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	I agree with the crowd who suggest not being to hard on your self. Learning to deal with rejection never gets easier, you just get more used to it over time. I checked out your profile and I think you're cute and you seem like a fun person so its just a matter of putting yourself in situations where you can meet quality guys. Double-takes and smiles are nice but purely based on an initial physical reaction. You need to get involved in a club, group, church, class, or some kind of social situaton where you can meet guys who have similiar interests so you can talk to them without having the awkwardness of taking to a total stranger.    If you have some one specific in mind then you just have to find the right way to start a conversation... what is he into, is there something about his style or look that you can compliment, some causal way to start talking. I think most guys like it when a girl takes the initative, and if you get rejected... yeah it'll suck and you might get embarressed, but that is better then sitting home alone on a friday night typing away on yahoo. If I was single and a little younger I'd ask you out.  =)    Good Luck,    Dan|`|ldYh18EYaa	Jus ask simple ?'s, HI, HOW R U, HOWS UR DAY, i.e, and go to place that interest you, ur more likely to find guys who interest you while ur there. (p.s....long eye contact and smiles do the trick for any guy)|`|7jpz5M99aa	it's hard to be the initiator cause we girls are so used to being pursued, but when there's a guy you really like, it's worth it to put yourself out there and let him know. Depending on the guy, you'll know whether to be bold or more reserved, but either way just find ways to let him know you care! Look at it this way- even if you are rejected, what's so bad about that, you didn't commit a crime or anything! You're a normal person who has feelings, it's ok to let them show, and plus, it's only fair that we have to do this sometimes, look at all the guys gotta go thru, all the time.|`|AA11280020	the first girl i asked out rejected me and the rest was history youll see life goes on|`|AA12198286	I think you should just wait for the guy who would have the balls to follow through with his hearts desire. You look cool and do not need to approach guys to get a date. You're not a wuss like you tried to infer, you're just being a lady. Good luck.|`|a6479ee9003d3a57f8784aa4276245b3aa	I really don't have anything to say on this one. Just reading to learn myself.

49de4ad46d57eda0a6663ab84cb568e6aa	OK, I don't know anything about any detail here, but I have been through this and went about it altogether wrong. I would suggest that you sit down with her and tell her that you have something to discuss with her. Tell her that you are still friends with her and that you want to remain friends, so to preserve your friendship, you are requesting her to move out. She will probably react negatively, so be ready to answer questions like - "Why do you want me to move?" or "What about me bothers you?" Don't beat around the bush - be direct without being cruel. It will not be pleasant, but if you mean business, you may just salvage your friendship by being honest. Good luck.|`|8c49c58688ac0081e777952711d28433aa	That all depends.     Did you sign a lease? If so, you can tell her you are willing to fulfill your obligations as it relates to the lease. You can also tell her you would be willing to help her locate a replacement.     These are very tricky things. You certainly don't want to put her in a financial strain. However, if your reason for wanting to move is legitimate and wasn't something that a reasonable person would expect to encounter, i.e. her drug addicted boyfriend staying over all hours of the night, etc. I think you have good reason. If she doesn't understand that then she wasn't much of a friend or roomate.     If you have simply found a more accommodating situation I think you have a moral obligation to fulfill your lease.|`|d7a2f78b7490b329c8e48da6d6f9e2c5aa	well if u want to move out...just tell her nicely.....  if she feels bad....talk to her. tell y u want to move out and tell her that u can still be friends with her.......if she doesnt want u to..then i dont know wat else to say!    i hope this works!!! :)|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	this is a tricky situation.  tell her you feel its time for you to move on and begin your own life. tell her you will miss her and will keep in contact. best of luck!|`|bbd468fff811206ade65febd01821a60aa	well you could say you got a cut in pay and don't want to burden her with having to pay more then her share.

CnuwupbOaa	Try staying away from the phone conversations. Don't call him, let him call you. If it were you he would just hang up and not argue at all. When you argue face to face don't argue back. Try giving him a light subtle kiss on the shoulder every time he does something you don't like or becomes really distraught. It's a sign of showing no hostility. Though you might be in disagreement you are doing it to calm him down and reassure since words are clearly not working. When he is calm just ask him what's bothering him. Ask what's causing his precarious instability. When it begins to spiral out of control again start the up the shoulder kiss again.|`|68jDkzrTaa	sounds like a JERK!!! it also sounds like you need to stop waisting time on this fool. he is a abusing you  emotionally and you should leave him, for your own safety|`|z4nfhMZxaa	There's obviously something bothering him. Why don't you confront him in person and ask him what is his problem. You can't live like that. If he loved you too he wouldn't make your life so miserable.|`|W2HKcUAAaa	Please stop crying if he does not care that you are crying then he is not worthy of your love.  Maybe he has done something wrong and wants to shift the blame to you, like cheating perhaps?  Have you tried askign him what is up or is he wanting you to do something you will not do?  I know that he is either hiding something or thinking if I annoy her enough she will dump me and I won't feel guilty about it.  Even though it will hurt you need to lay it down and ask him what is the problem and how you feel.  If he cannot tell you then he does not respect you, tell him goodbye and he can call when he has an answer.  If you love him, let him go, if he loves you he will come back.

AA10789336	You seem to be an independent, play by your own rules kind of person.  Since you are not married to the man you can do anything you want.  Personally I think 2 kids are plenty to be responsible.  I am sorry to hear you do no embrace the role of being a full time mother.  It is the most important role in the world.  Companies don't care a hoot about you and most make you sell your family out.  The paycheck they give you is rarely compensation for what it cost you to go to work.  However any education that  you get can only make you a better mother and person.|`|95dc4a2b01ef94d6ce4e80b44cf7acf0aa	My dear, I stayed home with my kids for 4 years.  I love my children but this drove me nuts.  I am a worker.  I love working.  I do not see that you are wrong in wanting to work.  However, it is necessary that you and your partner make the decision together.  This is not worth problems in your relationship.  There are many types of birth control.  I have never been fixed and don't plan to be.  However, I do not any moire children either.  We just do not know what the future holds.  Be patient with him.  I do hope that you guys can meet in the middle and make a decision you both can live with.|`|BJIcuvMpaa	I think you just need to be honest with your spouse. If you have been together for so long he should understand that you have wants to.  I wouldn't feel guilty about not wanting to be a stay at home mom...you are 22, you need to complete all your wants in life to be happy so do it.  About getting fixed...like I said before...your 22. A lot could change in the next 10 years and you might want more kids.  I think it might be to early for you to get fixed but that is something you really need to think about.  Also there is always addoption.|`|0835f7d2c9dcc56b8a305054b6bf04b5aa	Before getting "fixed" look towards the future, I mean you're still young.  I had my first child when i was 22 and my last child when i was 30.  I've been married for 15 years and continue to be a stay at home mom. (my kids all in school but I help out at the schools and PTA) Money will come and go but to be a stay at home mom is the greatest reward in life.  You are the one raising your children, creating memories that will last a lifetime.  And best yet, giving your children the greatest sense of security.  I always wished I had got a career, but seeing a lot of kids out there in the world today, I look at my kids (now 15, 13 and 7) and see they are kids who respect others.  I am complimented all the time on how well behaved my children are and how polite my 15 year old son is.    I might not have a paycheck with being a stay at home mom, but the benefits are ones that no other job could ever give me.     Good Luck :)|`|AA11712544	Don't get fixed! For several reasons..you're just way too young!!You have to consider all kinds of horrible things to be realistic.What if you get divorced and remarried and want kids with someone else? God forbid,what is something happens to the 2 you have? I expect you'd have trouble finding a doc even willing to do the procedure on you. There are other reliable birth control options, make an appt.! Good luck!

Idk I've never done it and it's really stupid but it kinda makes sense :P|`|hSarBFtBaa	i spent the whole of today trying to pick a fight just so i would have someone to argue with..<br>  still unsure why exactly..<br>  :S|`|foKDFigOaa	We always like to be right and until we are we'll battle it out. lol Good luck trying to win. ;)|`|HykE5X0Laa	We just like to get straight to the point!
FWPSzFVhaa	It sounds like he does like you and he wants to get to know you.<br>  And you are understandably a bit shy about all the extra attention.<br>  Things do change when a guy realizes he has a romantic interest in a young lady.  This is natural.  <br>  <br>  The important thing to do is be honest with him.  If he was your friend before all the extra attention, then take him aside and be very honest with him about what you have noticed.  Let him know that you like him (and to what degree) - and what he can expect out of the relationship.  If you just want a friendship, there is nothing wrong with that.  If you are not sure yet, that is fine as well.  The secret in all of this is just to be honest.  It makes things a lot easier for both you and him.
PZhAlt3paa	sounds like you picked out a real winner there, best of luck to you and the 40 kids you'll have out of wedlock.|`|BJIcuvMpaa	Ask him to go out with you and a bunch of your friends....bowling or something....if he pays attention to you more then the other people then you'll def. know that he is interested.

If she is trying to steal your boyfriend (which isn't working! That means he really likes you...=D) than she is not your friend. If she thinks she's better than you just because you are dating her ex that is her problem. When people act like that to me, I try and find more ways of pissing them off. Maybe thats just something that triggers in my twisted mind because I find it fun. Anyways its your choice and everything falls into place at one point
b7bnBxy0aa	what a chicken!  i wouldn't even respond to that text!  something like that shouldn't be ruined with a text message!  don't get me wrong, he might mean it.  but saying it via text message is such a copout!|`|AA10797973	We live in the information age everything is email and and IM some sort of electronic communication. Maybe that is the only way he had enough courage to tell you that he loved you. Depends on you if you want to  believe him or not... personally my opinion, I wouldn't totally dissmiss the idea that he did love me just because it was a text message.|`|CnuwupbOaa	That could mean anything, but when anyone uses those words whether verbal or in a visual context you should believe them. No one should abuse it nor be unfaithful whenever they say it. I know many feel that the first 'I love you' should be the most cherishable moment, and yes, it was quite inconsiderate or naive on emotional terms. For now think nothing of it, he loves you and he expressed in a one form or another.|`|e23c16941bb029062e19150fc69a6aceaa	l don't think he loves you. He just wants to use you.|`|fb3qlvonaa	honestly i agree that we do live in a world of communication based on the latest technology, however Love is one of our most basic emotions and it should always be treated traditionally.  if it was true love i would want to look into your eyes and say it... yeah it would leave me completely vulnerable however thats the risk that he needs to understand when you say those three words.  it can not be done for the first time via text, phonecall, e-mail, carrier pidgeon, or any other method except for face to face.  best of luck to you and yours|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	I wouldn't... I'd believe it if he called and said it to you. Or, better yet, if he said it to you face-to-face.|`|AA11353174	...no....if he had to say it via text?....sounds like he's wimping out.

I have never heard of someone denying the fact that they are with someone. I can understand that people are nosy, because they are! But you still dont act like you not with someone that you really are!!!|`|0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	Do you really want to be with a guy who doesn't want to be with you enough to let others know it?  He's keeping his options open.  Quite possibly he's interested in someone else and he's just stringing you along in the meantime.  You deserve a guy who appreciates you and who's proud to be seen with you.  If he tries to keep it a secret, he's using you.  Period.|`|AA11677535	Oops! what kinda guy is that? A coward...? n yes he's definitely hiding something.You just have to keep a light relationship with him.know what I mean..?|`|AA11860478	I would tell him that you're not someone to be ashamed of, and if you're only good enough to be his secret then you're through.|`|1649f04592bee659fadf0d42aca54899aa	I think he is hiding something.  If you are going out with someone and care about them, the last thing you want to do is hide it!  Why is he worried about other people?  Do you really want to be going out with someone like that?  I think you need to find someone else who isn't ashamed to show that he cares for you.|`|AA11294409	not really! if he denies that you guys are going out, then he is hiding something. Confront him on this issue and get the truth!    Good Luck!|`|1dcf9e37d3a43128160db1ccdfe67a1aaa	Wow.  What a jerk.  Sorry, but if I guy refuses to admit that you are together, that's not a good sign.  He's either hiding something from you, from someone else, or is just a player who doesn't want to be "tied down."|`|5e33b866840367a82fc87d71567b8441aa	This depends a little bit on both of your socioeconomic status.  If you are both on the same playing field as far as being of similar culture, class, and racial background then you may want to start looking elsewhere.  Other times some guys say that they don't like other people in their business but in reality they feel insecure about crossing those divides I just mentioned above.  Of course the most probably answer is that he feels ashamed of having you for a girlfriend, which is reason enough to get rid of him and find some guy who has the self confidence not to worry about what others think.|`|8b606127c9be2be58aee79d6bf12e686aa	No you shouldn't believe him! Ask yourself this question if you were doing it to him how would he really react? He's hiding something, either he's seeing someone other than you or you're just the fill-in until he finds someone else that he really wants to be with. You should cut your losses, don't you feel you deserve better than what he's giving you? Do you feel he's disrespecting you? He's not willing to claim you in public but he is behind closed doors. Girl, let that reject go and get you someone that wants to and will love and respect you. Trust me there's a better guy out there for you. Get rid of that jackass so you an get you a real man.|`|be30bf240d64b33b8d52cf8607572421aa	no|`|2ff545583b6acb189f7777aa3c0ab2b2aa	Cut him off respect yourself  good luck|`|1b1bd3a30807efbc34f79b2b281007d2aa	I'd wacth him because its something bad or he donesn't want people to no he likes you you call the shoots and make sure he nos you do
d9464321e125fd7edff54ce91073de3daa	Bonjour, cela m'est arriv il y a tout juste un mois en perdant ma grand-mre, je n'acceptais pas cette ide de la perdre et pourtant elle ne dsirait que la mort, c'est trs dur  "entendre" ce genre de phrase quand on est bien portant et aucunement prpar au dcs d'un proche.  Alors je te conseille de passer un maximum de temps avec cette personne, de lui "parler" ne serait-ce que par des changes de regards quand le dialogue n'est pas possible, de dire que tu es l, que tu sais qu'elle va aller mieux dans ce monde qui nous est inconnu o elle va rejoindre d'autres disparus, de la caliner, lui prendre la main...Je pense que certaines personnes n'attendent que ?a, notre prsence et pour ma part ma grand-mre s'en est alle aprs de terribles souffrances, au beau milieu d'une nuit, et son visage aprs sa mort tait totalement apais car elle avait pu dire au revoir mme  la famille lointaine.  Je te conseille aussi un livre magnifique qui m'a beaucoup aide : "La mort intime" de Marie De Hennezel une psychologue.  Bon courage et surtout fais ce que tu ressens au plus profond de toi, tu ne le regretteras pas.|`|d259e286d1fe3b4c73c4262ed81b223faa	j'ai l'experience; il faut seulemetn rester a cote de lui et lui renconter de belles histoires et lui encourager. vous aller rire ensemle et il va oublier qu'il est mourant. et si il meur il va partir en paix. ce tout ceque tu peut fair pour lui prceque tu ne peut pas changer son destin|`|a1a8cfbecb7e297e061b4730216e200daa	Salut,    La mort vaste sujet, la rponse dpend de deux facteurs :  1)si vous tes croyant  2) si vous ne l'tes pas  Car se sont des attitudes compltement diffrentes dans cette preuve de vie.  Dj, je tiens personnellement  vous dire mon respect pour avoir pris la dcision d'accompagner une personne et de tendre une main dans un moment aussi difficile, trs souvent, les gens ont peur de la mort et se dtourne sans mchancet.    Etre soutenu dans ce moment est vital.  Il ne faut surtout pas culpabiliser, vous n'tes pas goiste sinon vous ne sauriez pas l prs d'elle.  De ne pas vouloir la partir est un sentiment humble et une preuve certaine de l'affection que vous lui tmoigner et c'est grace  cel qu'elle trouvera son repos.  Ne soyez pas inquit pour pour elle, je suis sure que c'est une personne de grande valeur et elle obtiendra sa paix.  Maintenant, celui qui souffre c'est celui qui reste et qui devra vivre avec l'abscence d'une personne aime et cette souffrance est dure.  Le plus important pour le moment, n'est pas de parler de sa mort mais du chemin que vous allez faire encore ensemble, ils vous restent  tous 2 encore de bons moments  vivre, elle vous sait prs d'elle et c'est le plus cadeau que vous pouviez lui offrir dans ses derniers moments, soyez heureux d'avoir la chance de pouvoir profiter de ces instants et de pouvoir lui exprimer tout v?tre amour pour elle,( tellement de gens ne comprennent la mort quand on peut plus dire  l'autre son ressentir)   Vous vous avez cette chance alors ne vous torturer pas l'esprit.  Vivez c'est instant comme un cadeau du ciel, tenez sa main et elle trouvera sa paix et sans le savoir, vous construisez un aprs qui sera riche de bons souvenirs et c'est cel qui vous permettra de supportez son dpart et vous recontruire ensuite.    J'espre avoir pu vous apporter une aide et courage, toute mes flicitations.  Je reste  v?tre coute si vous le dsirez.  bonne journe.|`|254cb364688ee1f6c6970a78bf0c0db9aa	Ton soutien est d'une importance capitale pour l'aider  partir en paix.|`|98517c48d808f14c5f7c92e95f86227faa	il faut que tu acceptes tout d'abord qu'elle va partir..quand ca sera fait, tu penseras plus a ceux qui resteront et qu'il faudra soutenir!! c'est comme ca qu'elle partira en paix|`|a9482242c9ffa7d8792541613518bac0aa	Si tu es croyant, va voir un ministre du culte.  courage.|`|79e469102bd35af2ebfe7202c3531dc0aa	On ne l'accepte pas, mais on le subit...

Depuis deux ans j'ai perdu mon pre. Je met en pratique tous les jours ce qu'il m'a lguer moralement. Il est vrai que le jour o ... j'ai eu une peur terrible de tout oublier. Le tristesse et le chagrin en tait la cause, mais on n'oublie pas !!    L'essentiel c'est de moins y penser mais de ne pas oublier ...!!    Pour mon pre cela a t assez rapide. 26 jours entre la dcouverte de son mal (tumer)  et son dcs !!!  Il y a une chose que je m'tais toujours promis,  le jour o je me retrouverais dans cette situation, de le tenir dans mes bras pour de son dernier soupir. Je l'ai fait, je crois que cela m'a beaucoup aid pour l'aprs ... Mais c'est terrible  faire.    J'aurais eu beaucoup de mal  le voire souffrir. La mort chez nous n'a jamais t un sujet tabou.

94f62744db20215879a4398553585b22aa	Make eye contact. If he looks back at you, flash him a shy sexy smile. Laugh at his jokes. Not obnoxiously like OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO FUNNY! Just to show that you're interested in what he says. Mirror his body language. Touch him innocently. For example, if you come up to him to talk to him, touch his arm lightly while you say hello. If you're gutsy enough, you can try the following. Say things close to him in his ear, as though it's a secret, even something simple. This will strengthen your connection. MyJellybean.com has an excellent flirting guide. Good luck!|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	give him alot of eye contact and big, warm, sweet, approachable smiles. if u know in advance u are going to be around him, wear nice clothes that show u off. especially low cut tops. if he drops something pick it up for him, it will give him the hint.

I generally don't take on new friendships, rather I have acquaintances, I know a lot of people and extend the hand of friendship in the same manner they do, I make it a rule to not have new people at my home until I have known them a while, I generally don't lend or loan money or items and always say this if asked, "I make it a rule never to loan or borrow from friends, it saves arguments later on, if something goes wrong" most people don't have a problem with this, as it is a broad based ruling and I stick by it. I have 3 close friends, that I regularly speak and socialize with and that is heaps, I have my alone time and I have a load of people I know that at any given time I can call up and catch up with or do something with, and because we see little of each other, it is a novelty and usually a great time|`|mec8ci3qaa	My basketball teammate.

kfWi9ZkEaa	There is in fact only one way to be a good kisser and it has nothing to do with practice.  You just have to, when kissing, lean back and enjoy the ride.<br>  <br>  That is TRULY all there is to it.  There are no 'tricks and techniques' - there is only the enjoyment of the sensation.|`|N361k5Hsaa	just practice with him if he doesnt mind though practive makes perfect and dnt practice with objects better with the real thing then something else|`|YIVbU1rBaa	amigo,i laughed when you said without practice, practice makes perfect!! ahahaha.|`|634jf1L4aa	You shouldn't worry about using tongue when you first start kissing.  That's a more advanced move.  <br>  Just like everything else in life, you're not going to become an expert the first time you do something.  You can't really truly become a good kisser without practice.  You can ask your buddies what good techniques are, study it, whatever, and that will help I bet, but when it comes down to it, you're just going to have to practice by doing like the rest of us.|`|dJsis1Umaa	ew gross about the brother thing, haha.<br>  and idk but dont ask him if he thinks ur a good kisser cuz that just makes it awkward cuz if its ur first time its probably not gonna be that great lol :p<br>  but uhh, dont lick his face and hold on to the back of his neck and get on top of him lol|`|cDqz71QKaa	lick your lips when no one is looking<br>  its good practice<br>  and make sure to keep your tongue in eac others mouth<br>  or else its more like puppy dog licks<br>  and dont drink milk your stuff like that<br>  have candy or something fruity and juicy that maeks your mouth water|`|wdc4gwq4aa	That is pretty much all.

If he says he is going because he wants to dance  he is lieing or he's gay.|`|4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Hey Mandi... its been my experience that 99% of the time a single guy goes to a bar or club he does so with the hope of hooking up. Its just hard coded into the DNA. The success rate obviously varies greatly based on the guy, but I bet its less then 10%.     Its possible that a guy just wants a drink, to watch a game, hang with friends at a bar, but they are always checking out the scenery with an eye on who he might be able to get into bed. As for clubs, there are a few guys who might actaully go to dance, but I don't know any.     If the guy is not single, then he is still going to check out the hotties and fantazie a little... and in some cases even to cheat.     Even the most noble of men are in the end still just men.    Dan|`|igWi4umlaa	huh ...why are u such a liers?I v seen al the answer and my opinon is that u are all liers,  of course that is our intention alwayas!!!! who doesnt want to bring a girl home from the 1st date? everyone wants it! some of them even  if they have wifes or gf  they still want tpo bring u home in case they are homealone or alone in the bar/club and if they know its mot posible for their gf to find out  they will go for it! not all the cases but almost all the guys are like that , me  I am just like this , sure..in case I have somone and I care a lot about her I can go and have fun alone(wthout gf) in a bar and dont think to bring or to hook up a girl.its something u should have known , dont know why u are asking but anyay i hope i helped u.  tks!|`|wMXNAdW9aa	Depends on the guy. Some guys that's the main goal EVERY night, but with others it's not all about getting a girl back to his place. It really depends on the individual and what his intentions are from the outset.

e5QGX0v5aa	If you know this girl very well and if you are friends with her, just try talking to her when you guys are hanging out. Other than that if you just like her, but she really doesn't know you that well, try going up to her and being very polite to her, asking her if she would like to hang out sometime, rather that the term "going out." I think she probably would appreciate it more if you were a gentleman about it. Girls definetly like it when you charm them and are very polite about it, and who knows she might feel the same way about you! I hope it worsk well with you =)|`|0rTSZsyTaa	walk up to a girl that u like and say "sup baby want to go out" she might say yes if u act calm about it and u might get her to laugh but thats totally hot my little brother(who is 10 also) did that he got a g/f alright|`|LkPKmRfWaa	ok, first tell her yuu like her on IM or email, thn if she replies "ok thn"  (if she doesnt give a straight answer) ask her out next ime u see her. if she says "EW MAN" "HELL NO" and blah blah... dont ask her out.   and wen u ask her out say "do u wanna hang out sumtime?"  or something like tht.... dont make it look like u just "asked her out" do it casually like a buddy to buddy sort of waii.   always keep a cute and sweet atittude BEFORE u ask her out, thn on ur DATE act romantic... girls luv tht:P  and keep on smiling, if something embarracing happens laugh it out.
Ho6PUiZPaa	i think that if a guy walked up to me and was just brave and confident, that would be better than anything else.|`|AA11521704	Girls are NOT another species, they're just like you!  They all have insecurities, anxieties, and hang-ups just like guys do (or usually WORSE!)  Just be yourself, be friendly, and be interested in what they say---DON'T spend the conversation looking at her chest!  Become friends, and see what happens.   Maybe they sense you are too needy? Just relax & enjoy their company.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Try going to doubleyourdating dot com and sign up for the free newsletter.|`|531c1ea4e62e6dc6410edfab8819dd21aa	At least you have your head on straight and you're not just asking "How do I get someone to like me?".     Right, well, it's easiest if you're in a club or something, because your interests will be similar enough to talk. Girls are essentially like guys, since we're all human beings, but we don't tend to tell as many dirty jokes. Just be casual and cool and talk to a few girls...a couple of days isn't enough to just ask someone out, though, but if you're friends for a long while she'll probably stop seeing you as a potential mate and just as a friend.    Good luck :)|`|AA10067392	Would you go out with a girl who HATE HER LIFE???  First, love yourself, and you will attract girls.|`|AA11556947	heard of the saying "nothing ventured nothing gained" "lots of fishes in the sea"  u say ur good looking so you have low self esteem and just because one girl turned you down doesn' t mean anything and it doesn't mean she though you were ugly either. other reasons to turn a guy down than that.  Ask a girl to do something with u in your classes. ask for help on something. have her as a study buddy and etc. how did you meet all your guy friends. do it in that manner.|`|800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	First up, how old are you? I'm guessing around 15 (I'm probably wrong!)  You're at a tricky age girlfriend-wise. The girls in your year are probably looking for older guys, and younger gilrs are TOO young!   It sounds like you need more confidence with girls. The best way to get comfortable around girls - honestly - is to be friends with them first. You must sit near girls in some of your lessons. Just get talking to them - ask them about coursework, or ask them to explain something to you. And do it genuinely. Don't try to talk to them as a introduction to asking them out. Just talk to them for the pleasure of trying to make a new friend.   Look at the kinds of sports you play. Football won't be good for meeting girls. Tennis, on the other hand appeals to both sexes and we're coming up to tennis season. Likewise, after-school clubs. Chess - blokey; drama club - appeals to both. Science club - blue zone; music - purple zone (both pink and blue!) Get yourself into situations where you can find common ground with girls and conversation and friendship will follow.  Girls seem weird, but they are very much like boys in a lot of ways (but they smell nicer!)   One last thing: there is a LOT of time to find a girlfriend yet. There are more important things to concentrate on at the moment. Don't let it get you down too much.|`|vHFPPK4Taa	You actually don't need a girlfriend.  You can be with a lot of women without actually dating any of them.  "The one" doesn't exist, so don't get hung up on one -- move on to the next one.|`|xdlZOTYpaa	u must be either fat, spotty, ugly or emo.|`|bd1a8f8d0324c0919114dbfbce635690aa	Dude, you just need to be happy in your own skin.

Friday after work or college classes, get a sexxy Hooker to give a good (safe) BJ to loosen up your nerves.  2.  Shower thoroughly. Drink about 2 nice stiff drinks (if you're over 21 yrs old).  3.  Friday & Saturday night, go to a party or club and you will have your confidence to approach ANY female and the tolerance to accept rejection, but patience to keep trying.   Why? because you've already gotten BOSS (headjob), and your confidence will naturally shine on these girls vibing that you're not desperate or a mamma's boy.     I'm a Playa, attractive & single and been with MANY women (never needed a Hooker).   *Each female is like a combination lock & you'll have to find their right combination. It's up to YOU if she's worth the effort.  Good lUCK
CnuwupbOaa	He formally apologize, you should trust in his sincerity. If he's lying then there's nothing you could do to prevent or help that. Maybe he's just unaware of what he was doing. Maybe he tried to be discreet without you noticing. Just put it behind you if he apologized already.

lYHwQsOvaa	Ok I'll lay it to you straight. Don't listen to any of these other romantic virgins. My first time I was very nervous. You will be. If you want to make it last longer, you could jerk it earlier that day. Whatever those others are saying, you will not give her an orgasm. Don't sit there and ask a lot of questions the first time, did you like it? Did you ***? you will get a lie. It will be a lot of clumbsy foddling around. It takes a very long time to get a girl to climax. You will need a lot of experience, know what buttons to press, and many girls have trouble with it.<br>  <br>   Keep to a couple of basic positions, no kama sutra until you've been doing it for many many months. Keep a position where you can keep eye contact. Cowgirl and missionary is good for you. <br>  <br>  Don't rush into it. Be sure to get her warmed up with some manual stimulation. Once you get inside, 2 fingers, and make a come here motion, but just tap the tips of your fingers like a turbo button. <br>  <br>  Afterwards. some good cuddling and staring at each other's eyes is in order. Don't go bragging. God know you don't have anything to brag about and above all remain a gentleman. <br>  <br>  Anyways thats my 2 cents. Have fun and be sure to wear a condom.|`|lckgvz2laa	You allready answered your own question. Take it slow, relax and don't rush. Give your woman an orgasm first. Then slowly start all over again, this time with your pleasure in mind. But if possible, give her another orgasm..:-)|`|e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	get married first and your first time will be awesome if you do it before marriage you will regret it.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	some lose it the first time before they even get in hon sorry|`|ddWyRjmVaa	just....<br>  go in there and do it!!!<br>  lol
XB4TQZdkaa	Think about whether its worth it to you to risk your friendship. Will you still be able to be friends if he says no? or if you guys break up? It depends on your situation and how important and how strong your friendship is and how much you like him. Do YOU think he likes you back? But honestly if he's your friend then go for it.|`|wwhmB5jZaa	Just ask casually if he wants to go with you somewhere. Find out some places he likes to go and ask if he wants to come with you there. Invite some friends along if your afraid of just the two of you being awkward alone.
Z3tAweOAaa	You should ask him face to face... And no offense but that "Will you be my Valentine" line is sort of cheesy :P... Unless you're really good friends with him. If I were you I wouldn't ask on Valentines Day.... For fear of being rejected. I think it would hurt more o.O|`|AA11810119	you should give him a nice note and decorate it with scented spray and stuff and write where he should meet you! and then where ever you go throw him a i like you party just for him he might like that or if he might be embaressed  then just have it private|`|32c3c690594a41792d7e3b361518450eaa	i sayy go for it :D ^_^|`|j1CL0jbTaa	don't do it through a note....that is like elementary school stuff  ask him face to face..it will mean more
e2c1d658b585c921795c57d26a581459aa	The same way a guy would tell a woman - say that you like him but that you don't want a relationship with him.  But you'd like to have a casual relationship with him and have sex but that you want to be clear that it will not be anything more than sex.  If he can handle that without expecting anything more, then great.  If not, move on to the next victim.|`|8D3g0MHxaa	I don't think he realizes what's going on.|`|FpoRbK3Jaa	use him for good sex  if he gives good sex!|`|AA11328507	Perhpas his bubble wont be broken.  sit him down and just be honest with himl|`|o5PrHDyTaa	Just tell him your a "insert word here" and you only want him for his utilitarian properties.|`|MHIWM8HBaa	first...have sex with him|`|qtCEbcLFaa	some pepps cant hadle "friends w/ benifits" it's all or nothing, nada, zippo, zero, zilch, capooski. . .|`|b77963c97585c64935d438a1e0638a83aa	I think it could go one of 2 ways.  I think that the idea of just having sex or nothing at all, might compel him to want to stick around for just the sex, or his feelings might be too much and he might not want to have sex with you for fear that he might get even more feelings for you and get hurt.  I would put it out there and tell him exactly how you feel.
ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	Hola jaky mira no te preocupes por algo se van a casar, yo pienso que todas las mujeres y no digan que no pues a veces pensamos que podemos perder a la persona que amamos y pues por eso actuamos asi, pero ojo esto solo lo asusta mas recuerda que la confianza es algo vital en una relacion, y recuerda esto por algo es tu novio y por algo sera tu esposo ademas, a ningun hombre le gusta que anden encima de el con llamadas, es mas ahora cambia la tactica aunque te cueste un buen no lo llames, mejor salte de compras o a bobear con tus amigas para que no andes pensando en esas cosas tendras tu mente ocupada un chorro de cosas que contarle cuaando lo veas y hasta te apuesto que como ya no vera tus llamadas se sacara de onda y querra buscarte mas, de verdad yo no creo que tengas de que preocuparte tu segura de que eres una chava muy valiosa y que ambos son afortunados de tenerse recuerda postivismo, veras que ya pronto ni te acordaras y espero que despues de septiembre envies fotos de tu hermosa luna de miel, saludos !!!!!!!|`|BDu2TN2Naa	Definitivamente ESTAS DESESPERADA!... mira amiga, te respondo esto porque a mi me paso, yo amaba muchisimo a mi novio, de verdad y todo era absolutamente perfecto, PERO el era tan celoso y posesivo que sabes a paso? ME PERDIO...  era imposible que yo pudiera estar tranquila donde sea, y yo no hacia nada!!! las cosas siguieron asi hasta que definitivamente me fui con otra persona que me de el espacio q el no me supo dar... No le canses, no le molestes tanto... te quieres casar con alguien q no confias? si sigues asi no solo q no te casaras sino q lo vas a perder... Mira una cosa bien importante, el debe serte fiel no porque tu lo cuidas sino porque nace de el serte fiel o sea q segun tu le vas a dar las espaldas y el va a caer con la primera? mira q con tu actitud lo vas a obligar  a hacerlo... Piensa bien lo que haces y suerte|`|rS4AmICcaa	Hola Jacqueline se me hace una buena pregunta porque es mi caso, yo igual me caso este a?o y mi novia es tal como te describes......

En si la solucion que yo pudiera decirte es que le dijeras que trataras de ser menos posesiva y que por tal motivo no lo estaras correteando todo el dia ( ojo!! dicelo porque sino va a pensar el que ya no le interesas y podria resultar peor ) espero te ayude de algo mi punto de vista estando del otro lado de la moneda  Saludos|`|LeG7EXtZaa	Yo apoyo a May, todas somos celosas pero no te dejes ganar por ellos, talvez tuviste antes una mala experiencia, pero si el se va a casar contigo es por que te ama, ten paciencia y confia en el.|`|25570117620c0471b46b41ab13b09f00aa	QUIERES AYUDA???,   COMO PIDES AYUDA, CUANDO TU ERES LA CULPABLE,  MEJOR  RECAPACITA  OK.|`|CWByvCDtaa	Eso que mencionas es inseguridad en tu persona, primeramente tienes que confiar en ti para que despus  puedas confiar en el, con los hechos que haces solamente estas  logrando como ya lo dices que el se aleje de ti y que recapacite que si eso es ahorita de novios imaginate de casados,     Trata de cambiar tu actitud hacia el si es que de verdad lo amas, ten ms confianza en el creele, no lo llames tanto seguido,  por que de lo contrario tu misma lo vas a orillar que se enfade y hasta que salga con otras chicas.    La base ante todo acuerdate que es la confianza, la comunicacin y la comprensin.  Suerte!!!!!!|`|smDpvFXDaa	si lo quieres tanto piensa que si sigues as lo perders  si se va a casar contigo sera por algo...confa en el|`|1f6face563efd451d813dd8a99bfff1baa	Mientras no cambies tu forma de ser, jamas confiaras en nadie ya que no lo haces ni en ti misma.  Lamentablemente estaria en lo cierto tu novio si no se casa contigo, el desea ser feliz a tu lado no un infeliz a tu lado.  Tienes que aprender a ser menos impulsiva, a confiar a quererte a amarte y respetarte si consigues todo eso para ti, entonces habras logrado el que tu novio te quiera, te respete y te amara con locura, pero mientras no cambies, solita te quedaras.  Mucha suerte|`|nNFwINOWaa	Recuerda que las cuatro cosas escenciales en un matrimonio son: El Amor, La Confianza, El Respeto y La Comunicacin, no importa el orden, analiza si en tu relacion existen todos estos elementos. y despus sabras que hacer  Animo todo tiene solucin|`|nDm4rH0gaa	Querida jackelin......fuera de no hacer nada que mas haces,por que si tuvieras una actividad no tendrias tiempo para tus inseguridades,ademas que los celos son una enfermedad que van en aumento dia tras dia,cada dia nace  una nueva motivacion para celar.....mija creemelo cuando seas segura de ti misma,cuando tu te quieras a ti misma y cuando realmente no sientas necesidad de alguien recien ahi empieza a pensar en relacionarte con alguien la vida es tan corta como para vivirla con la opresion de los celos que es mejor quedarse solo.No te cases seria un grave y peligroso error...dale tiempo a tu vida vive tu vida sin depender de otros y cuando estes segura de ti busca de vuelta a tu novio|`|lPBJZmrZaa	Piensa si tienes razn para desconfiar... si hay algn motivo hablalo con l para q puedan resolverlo, o de plano si hay algo q te molesta a tal grado, piensa si eres T quien quiere casarse con l... pero si no hay motivos, pues deja de preocuparte por lo q haga, aprende a confiar y si es necesario, ve con un psicologo para q te ayude a superar la inseguridad.

As we walk i would let her have my jacket and my arms around her. Then after the sunset. i would like to take her to her favorite place to eat.

AA11033750	I'm gonna say... No.. nobody knows her. She could be anywhere in the world, although the highest probability of being in India, followed by the UK and the US. But who knows, she could've gone to Singapore... what did she study?

She shouldn't treat her daughter like that and you should leave them both. My guess is to that if you found another guy your mother could come after him also and if you leave the other guy alone and still associate with your mother, she and the other guy could hook up and I'm sure that would be pretty weird for you and you shouldn't put yourself through that with that guy or to be around your mother.|`|5a4d103c78ee0c414e47655006e77fb4aa	what the **** is her problem?!?! she is your mother!!!  talk to her and tell her that she is really being stupid about this and that she needs to get a boyfriend HER age, and stop going after younger ones!|`|f9975ab4c13aed1f32e00ad27d4a622caa	if you was 10 and this guy had a crush on you and your mom how old is he? this would make me worried if someone old enought to like your mom would be interested in you at 10. are you sure hes not a perv.  well what ever you do dont bring your kids around him he may like them too.as for you mom even thought she sounds like a witch hes probably not worth either of you hurting eachother so neither of you should date him|`|0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	Why do you want to be with a guy who is only interested in you because it could get him to your mother without getting him in trouble with your stepdad?

CnuwupbOaa	I think you should open to what people have to say. What everyone has to say. It would create something extra to think about, and sometimes the feeling of ignorance is bliss. Trusting her word is a choice. I wouldn't.    You should also know that people do in fact change and do things differently as a result of a failing relationship. I believe she no longer has feeling for your boyfriend and also has gained a bitterness for him. She's probably trying to evoke negative thought about him. You don't need that.    You should ask him how it ended. Was it totally destructive for her?|`|9f47bdd6ff1383b2740a669bf5ba5704aa	what????|`|vBlmnQCOaa	wtf did you just say?

N4X8VSUvaa	.   If this person is truly your best friend you should be able to talk to him.  Confront him.  Let him know how hurtful he is being.  Let him know his words are like toothpaste once they leave the tube your can't easily put them back.  And from now on don't tell him any secrets that you don't want spread around.  You may have to let some of those secrets and embarrassing stories that have gotten out just brush them off as ridiculous.  If you have to deal with the situation for the next 2 years you will have to take a serious look if this is a friend and talk it out ask why he feels threatened by you.  Ask what you can do to save this friendship if you think it is worth it.|`|oU1yUxwwaa	I trust that the pair of you aren't friends anymore. If you aren't or even if you still are let him know how you feel about what he did and let him know that it was very wrong. If you know some secrets of his then you might threaten him that you wiill tell his secrets.<br>  <br>  Don't really do it just tell him that you will. If you don't know any of his secrets then just try your best to ignore him. That's all you can do unless you are going to change schools which it doesn't seem like you are going to do that|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	So tell me, who blabbed first, you or him?  <br>  <br>  Sorry, that wasn't helpful.  Maintain dignity.  Say nothing against him.  Act like you don't know any of what's going on.  When your secrets come back at you, say 'what?'  "who said that?"<br>   Look confused.  Look UNINTERESTED.  shrug in a kind of 'so what' way.  <br>  <br>  It didn't happen to you.  leave it where it sits.  It will then die.<br>  <br>  as to the friend: nice & friendly, nod and smile and slide on past.  No waves, no 'breakup' - nothing.<br>  <br>  How did you threaten him?  Did you do something stupid like tell him you would blab on him?  Did he get in first, as it were?<br>  <br>  Ay?|`|3ZVuExYcaa	Well i think hes not your real friend...your best friend would never do that to you.Stop hanging out with the guy!<br>  <br>  I kinda have the same problem...my friends keep making fun of me,but idk if they say it as a joke or not...please help me!|`|pKnFNP8Haa	well ask him and if hes doing that tell other people his secrets<br>  or stop being friends with him|`|Y6YaMR34aa	hes a jerk tell da counseler|`|PxDIyucWaa	You need to confront this person and hear his explanation.  Then you need to figure out whether he is worth having in your life anymore.<br>  <br>  If not, the remaining 2 years do not have to be awkward for you ... you have done nothing wrong.  If anything, remaining time would be awkward for HIM, as he has been a disrespectful jerk to you and is not worthy of your friendship.  <br>  <br>  Hold your head high, calmly listen to any explanation, and make a decision about whether you want this kind of person around you.  Personally I don't think you could ever trust him again, but that is not your fault.
Upt2MatKaa	i'm guessing by "long distance" you mean "other side of town" rather than another city?    i presume your school friends are used to dating people from the same school where it is easier to see each other ... you can possibly walk/cycle to each other's house, or meet at the local cafe?    so, by seeing someone on the other side of town you're going to have to be a little more organised, take the bus or get a lift from your parents/friends, and meet somewhere half way.    this doesn't exactly count as a long distance relationship, but i suppose if you don't have your own transport then any distance beyond walking can seem like the end of the earth.    as other answers suggest, the odds are stacked against long distance relationships for a number of reasons.  partly because you can't spontaneously spend time with each other, things fall into a routine or pattern, there's a degree of effort/hassle involved in getting together, and sooner or later one side usually decides they'd prefer something a little easier, or someone closer to home.    i don't suppose you've anything to lose, and by the sounds of things he's not on the other side of the country.  you could go to the play and catch up with him, try to gauge the vibe .... at the very end of the night, when you're ready to go home you could ask if he wants your number.  if he says yes then hopefully he'll call and that'll be great, if he says no then the embarrassment will only be momentary as you'll be leaving anyway and won't have to endure it for too long.    nothing ventured, nothing gained.    good luck :o)|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	Well, as long as he's not TOO far away, things should go smoothly. I would go to the play and "play" everything by ear. If it's meant to be, it'll happen. This is sort of what I went through with my first bf in high school. He was going to be a freshman in college and I was starting my senior year. It's better to start something now than later on because at least you will have a base to start on.    Best of luck.|`|kJmJ60Xfaa	just know that long distance relationships have their good and bad sides|`|CnuwupbOaa	You can give it to him if you plan on wasting time. Long distance relationships don't work. Eventually you or he'll lose the jones for the other.
4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	If you are a pretty outgoing person by nature, but get shy around guys then I expect you get more comfortable as you get more experience. Its normal to be a little nervous and not wanting to get embarressed. However the only way to get past this phase is to be more assertive... and remember you are not really gonna know how he feels about you until you ask him. Having friends try and find out for you can often backfire... do it yourself. And you don't have to just come up to him and say do you like me... although some guys like that... just wait for a time when you are alone with him try and work your way up to it... a little small talk about classes or music or movies or something... then maybe some general questions about does he like anyone or what does he think about your hair or your clothes... if by then you can't tell how he feels then you probably just have to come out and say something like... so have you ever thought about you and me?     Hope that helps!    Good Luck    Dan

Sometimes the other person decides they just want out and there's NOTHING to be done about it!  You can't make a person stay where they don't want to be!  A person may be doing the very best they can and putting effort into the marriage while the other person is pretending to make an effort, but he really has one foot out of the door, ever consider that?<br>  <br>  When I married in 1980, I married in good faith that it would be until death do us part.  The first few years were very happy ones as I can recall. When my husband walked out on me after 9 years of marriage, I was absolutely devastated. I knew there were some issues, but nothing I figured that couldn't be worked out.  Anyway, he broke the news to me that he was leaving on a Sunday after I had come home from Mass! Within a week, he had his girlfriend living with him and he was living this "playboy" lifestyle and attempting to act like neither me or his children existed! He left me almost financially destitute after moving us to a new state where I had no family nearby, no friends, and only a part-time job...so I LITERALLY had to start over from ground zero and raise my kids alone while trying to heal a broken heart and stay one step ahead of poverty!  <br>  <br>  For YEARS I blamed myself for the marriage ending. At night I'd cry and ask myself over and over what I did so wrong as to deserve him leaving me. Was I not pretty enough? Was I not smart enough? (which is rich when you consider I was going to college when he left me for a high school dropout!)  Was I not sexy enough? Was I too career or education driven? Was I a bad parent? Was I not a "good" submissive Christian wife like everyone told me I should be? Was he ashamed of me for being Black? and the worst one...was God punishing me for some unknown reason? <br>  <br>  In August, it will be 20 years since my divorce. When I look back, I realize the marriage ending was in no way my fault! I simply had the misfortune to marry a man who even though he had promised to love and honor at the start...later on at some point in the marriage he changed courses in midstream. In other words, HE CHOSE to "check out" of the marriage emotionally and eventually he physically left.  Even thought we had went to marriage counseling and he told people our marriage was 'happy' and 'stable', he still walked out anyway simply because as he said to me "I don't love you anymore...and life's too short to be miserable. I want to see other women!" <br>  <br>  Yes, I do now have a boyfriend (after 12 years of being alone and virtually dateless) but I've not remarried and I don't know if I ever will. I'm not sure I want to take the chance of being left like that a 2d time! It hurt too much the 1st time around...and quite frankly, it's made me afraid to trust anyone now.  <br>  <br>  At any rate, I finally got to the place in my life where I realized that his lack of ability to truly commit to the marriage was and is in NO WAY my fault! I know in all good conscience I did all I could to make my marriage work!  <br>  <br>  I believe a lot of people do that, so the last thing the person who got "dumped" needs is to have someone else telling them that they made a "mistake" or screwed up when maybe they did not! The only "mistake" I made was falling in love in the first place and that's not really a mistake at all...especially when you consider I have two beautiful children as a result of that marriage!<br>  <br>  Also, what about people who have to get divorced due to serious issues such as alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, consistent infidelity or abandonment? Are you saying that the victim or innocent party in those cases are always at fault? If so, then you are definitely 100% WRONG!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Thanks for the compassion here...not!  <br>  <br>  Way I see it, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors...and unless a person is there, then they really have NO RIGHT to judge someone else or try to push that b.s. about it being "both their faults."  In fact, that is a MAJOR cop-out as far as I'm concerned!<br>  <br>  If I am so-called "worked up", then it is with justifiable reason! My abandoment/divorce nearly destroyed me psychologically, and it took me a very long time to heal...so I don't need to have wounds opened by insensitive people who are really judging and doing it under the guise of a "question."|`|TUNvbXbgaa	my ex was an abusive drunk. he would call me nasty names and he would grab me by my throat and shove ma against the wall and he had punched me in the back of my neck.   i am now married to a wonderful man|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I divorced because he cheated.

In the end, she through the relationship in the trash (as women are much more capable of doing than men).<br>  <br>  I wasn't completely innocent of wrongdoing though; however, what I did compared to what she did doesn't really even compare.<br>  <br>  In short, my wife ended the marriage and much more.  However, I'm the one that had to push for the divorce.  Ironic.|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	My husband was the same as Kim H's - for all I know, he WAS Kim H's husband. My mistake was to marry him in the first place. Having married him, my next mistake was to put his interests ahead of my own and pretend that my needs and feelings were less important. A part of me wants to say having kids was a mistake, because it kept me in the marriage; but I think the mistake was staying with him and trying to make it work for their sake.

NOW she has moved on and Iam the one just waiting for the divorce papers. My advice to everyone if its not to late, sit down and talk, be honest, open, if any problems are not to late to fix, try to fix them, Because at the end the woman you wanted to love for the rest of your life is gone and your all alone!!!|`|AA12025974	My husband was a looser and was scared of his own shadow.

91NnZqZ6aa	Hola:  Primero que todo quiero decirte que si es amor, nada por imposible que parezca y si ese chico es para ti, sera para ti de una u otra forma, te cuento mi historia, aunque no quiero entrar en muchos detalles, porque quiero ser lo mas breve posible, yo conoci a mi actual esposo en un aeropuerto, el obviamente era extranjero pero viajaba mucho tiempo para el mismo aeropuerto, fuimos amigos por un tiempo, luego me pidio ser su novia, cuando di el si lo hice por telefono en una llamada de larga distancia, apartir de ahi, nuestro cupido fue un telefono y un mesenger, desgraciadamente en esa epoca el ya no pudo viajar tan frecuentemente como lo hacia antes, lo deje de ver por 3 meses despues del si, y lo veia cada mes, ya que era cuando la empresa le permitia viajar por lo que tenia unos dias cada mes para verlo, mucha gente incluyendo mi familia pensaban que no funcionaria, que probablemente el estaba jugando conmigo, que era un pasatiempo para el, entre tantas otras cosas que me imagino te puedes imaginar. Duramos mas o menos 4 a;os de novios, fue un verdadero calvario el amarlo tanto y no verlo tan frecuentemente como yo hubiera querido, ademas de luchar contra los comentarios de mi familia y de amigos, pero al final de todo, me case con el y calle muchas bocas, aunque no te miento trate de ser muy precavida y no dejarme enganar ya que yo corri el riesgo de toparme con una mala persona y como mi familia me decia, haber estado con alguien que solo me queria para divertirse.... Mi consejo es, se precavida porque no sabes que tan sincero y que tanta verdad te diga por internet, puede ser casado y decir que es soltero, o un pervertido, etc, o que se yo, pero si dentro de ti sientes que es una persona sincera y que quiere conocerte, date la oportunidad pero sin dejar de estar en guardia, recuerda que ANTE TODO ESTA TU PROPIA SEGURIDAD y que mi historia es muy diferente a la tuya, tal vez yo corri con suerte al encontrarme a una buena persona, ojala tu tambien tengas esta misma suerte. De todo corazon te deseo lo mejor y si el es tu media naranja, cuidate y recuerda que el que no arriesga no gana!!!!!     |`|qRmztwdlaa	pues eso que dices primero necesitan verse saber que onda no esta mal intentarlo pero ya hablar de amor sin haberse visto pues quizas solo si valoran lo interior funcione pero si no se gustan en algo?|`|e82235e4b5f029be36ad0c4248d37299aa	no me ha pasado pero tengo una amiga que se enamoro 2 veces y viajo para conocer a sus galanes y se fue a vivir con ellos largas temporadas pero en ambos casos fracaso la relacion|`|60ac4124050acd7b29b552d070915644aa	Hay como crees eso no es amor solo por que te escribe cosas bonitas ya sienten que se ponen de tapete por una hay mejor ubicate y buscate un novio de verdad y si ya tienes cambialo.|`|8ee24d361e5055e458f748fcac166220aa	La hermana de una amiga es de Argentina y conocio a un peruano por chat, luego de varios a?os se conocienron personalmente y empezaron a salir, cuando ella podia viajaba a peru para verlo...Ahora estan casados y tienen dos hijos hermosos!!

Vamos para 3 de matrimonio. y el es de bien lejos, pero lo importante es que nos conocimos buscando el amor verdadero (ninguno de los dos estaba para juegos) y esa es la base de nuestra relacion....si yo quisiera jugar a lastimar a alguien...no me meteria con alguien de tan lejos. y lo mismo piensa el.  Ambos estamos contra la infidelidad y nos metimos en todo tipo de actividades en tiempos de soledad.   El asunto es que yo no se si otras parejas tendran los mismo elementos de base que nosotros....nosotros estabamos dispuestos a sacrificarnos por este amor y todavia creemos que nuestra union es lo que mas vale la pena en la vida.   Otra cosa..ninguno de nosotros tiene equipaje emocional del pasado, por eso yo no vivo temiendo de sus exnovias ni el de ningun novio pasado mio.

Solo ten cautela para que no salgas lstimada, y si te lanzas a fondo y solo resulta una aventura, pues mentalisate en esa posibilidad para que no resultes tan afectada al final.

I was not immediately in love with my last relationship. But by doing things together you will fall in love with him. You might be attracted to him and like him but falling in love needs a little time.    You need to build memories together. he needs to take your breath away before thinking about serious plans.  You will know if he is the one for you when you do not see yourself being with anybody else but him; when you want to give him your all and think about the future when you are with him. You probably will not be asking this question a year from now.

The way that you know if he is the one for you is by lissining to your heart i guess.  Ask your self these questions...  Are you happy with him?  Do you feel confert by his side?  When he gets close to you dous your heart sart betting fast and you get nervous?  When hes not around do you miss him?  Dous he treat you right?  Do he put you before his friends?  Do he say he loves you?  Do you both argue allot?  Can you picture yourself with him for the rest of your life?  Dous he get allong with your family? (hey need to know right)    These are some questions that wil let you know if he is the one.  Maybe if you just let time past you could actually see were your relationship is going.          Good luck i hope that you guys are happy together.|`|6fb4efdb394d69c7adb08dc85873dcf2aa	Well first off...you shouldn't be asking yourself..that's kind of a red flag right there.   Secondly you would know if you were in love, there would be no question.  You just feel it.  Something inside of you tells you that you have to have that person in your life.  Ask yourself how you would feel if you didn't have him in your life anymore and there's your answer.|`|AA11943241	No I do not feel he is the right one for you especially since you dont love him....

3GG5Lx7zaa	things change all the time. just give it a chance. meet friends at your dads house. take things with you that will make you feel more at home.? most importantly, let both of them know how you feel and that you will give it a chance, but if it doesnt work with you, what will they do to make it better?? are they doing this so no one pays the other child support?? they shoud be worried about whats best for you and not money. if you cant change anything, then make the best of the situation. your going to have to do it weather you like it or not, so choose to like it....sometimes its as simple as that. get a bike, make a new friend and hang out with them at their house. things usually fall into place in the end. never know what the future holds for you. but when your down....the only way is up!|`|lFL5W6jYaa	It's time to grow up honey, nit saying your immature but that what's gonna have to happen in order for you to keep your sanity.

I'm sure they'll understand :)|`|xvey8ixPaa	Unfortunately, if you are under 18 you do nto get to pick. They might ask your opinion in court and a judge mught listen to you or not, but you are under whatever your parents decide for you. I really would try this arrangement for at least 8 weeks. During this time, set up regular phone times with both parents and keep those phone dates. In the mean time, focus on trying to be the most interresting and amazing person you can be....for YOURSELF! Join a new club or class in the community or at church so that you have a weekly thing to be at. Unforturnately you will have to get the buy in of them both if you were to take up tap dance or cooking or a new youth group meeting. But, something that gives you a weekly structure outside of school would help you get a sense of new normal. Also asking them both if while you are at their respective houses they would set up some one on one "date night" time with you. Just you and that parent. This will help develop your one on one relationship with them both. It can be a movie, dinner, a walk in the park, getting nails done together, turning off the tv and playing a game, whatever, but a trie dnad true date night just for 2-4 hours just you two. I bet it would really make a big influence if you tried it. Then, after that amount of time, if it is not working you will have some leverage after cooperating for two months. But you really have to give it a good try and show you are putting in an effort. Missing your mom will be normal all the time.....I miss mine still and I am 45 and she lives down the street! that is a normal part of being a kid. But at the same time you need to bond with your dad, and this will give you the chance to do that. I say go for it! AND while you are at it....tell them you do not want to be lugging your stuff back and forth....you want duplicates of the big items at both places...curling irons, blow dryers, Etc....you should also have two weeks of underwear and socks and that so you only have to pack two weeks of clothes and then go....or you could really milk it and say you want two weeks of clothes at both places as well.....I know a girl here in my city that got that in the court papers and she was 13! It can be done! Good luck and do TRY. really, you really can be happy with them both, you just need to give it a try. A real one.|`|eca5081cf1a52165be5f0e9110f9d187aa	Don't worry about it.  Yes, you will probably miss your mom.  However, your father is just as important -- never forget that.  Learn to have a relationship with him too.  Both parents are important for you.<br>  <br>  Also, please tell your mom I applaud her maturity and wisdom in being cooperative with your father in terms of your time with him.  It shows she is a good mother.|`|82n7jtvVaa	well my mom and dad got a divorced when i was 7 so i had a hard time with that and but then i just got over it i mean my dad got married agian and kno its like i have to much too handle and they have 2 sons together that i have to take care of when there at work so u just gotta cope with it sorry but thats all i got|`|QuQioUd7aa	my mom has custody of me so i get to choose when i want to see my dad, if your older then 13, you should have right to choose what YOU want .|`|nqkXE1cUaa	1. Realize that the chances of your parents getting back together are very, very slim.<br>     2. Take advantage of therapy, if it's offered. Most likely, you can get it at school. Even if you don't think that you need it, go for a 3 month period. If you don't talk to someone, your feelings might overwhelm you.<br>     3. Demand visitation rights. It is not your parents' choice if you do or do not see your other parent. It's just as important to see your mom as it is your dad, or vice versa.<br>     4. Join an after school activity, such as music lessons or basketball, it will help take your mind off of stress. However, do not have one parent designated to paying for these activities or you may create more arguing. Have your parents split the costs.<br>     5. Avoid getting in the middle. If your parent starts bashing the other in front of you, walk away. Defending might get you an argument, or make your parent think you're a brat to contradict them. walking away teaches them that you won't take it.<br>     6. If a parent questions you about the other parent's personal business (taxes,paycheck,relationships,etc.) count to five and calmly state that that is personal and that if they want to know, they can ask.<br>     7. If it starts to get violent stay as far away as you can and call someone you trust imidiately for ex., neighbor, atorney,manager,police,etc, NEVER stand between them, that will only get you hurt.<br>     8. Jokes and Laughter are THE BEST ways to deal with a the stress involved in a divorce. Make sure you always talk and laugh with your friends. You could do your favorite activity for ex. basketball, guitar ex. or you could write about in poetry, books, songs, or just in a diary or jurnal.<br>     9. It is NEVER your fault. Do not blame yourself for the divorce. That will just make things worse for you.
PLouavP0aa	yea quite strange.<br>  <br>  <br>  a lot of mixed signals.<br>  <br>  <br>  you should try talking to him more. Im sure he will be thrilled
CnuwupbOaa	By your choice to ask for space and being expressive towards her had shown to her your weakness. She has been with others in the past, so you can assume that the way she is feeling is nothing new to her. She's experienced so it's easier for her to empathize. Don't allow her to she that your actions are predictable. She already knows that you seek something more.    When you have feelings for someone never ask for space. Embrace it and cherish what you have at that very moment. I believe you only did that only to extend your involvement with her. Don't push the person away.     You are right, she was being rude and inconsiderate of you at the concert, but need to give her her space and let her realize that herself. You told her she was being rude because you were feeling fearful and uneasy. Don't be. I don't think she be reconciling with this ex anytime soon. Let her attention focus on her ex. Don't smother her by indirectly implying to her that she needs to give you the attention. For now don't put anything out in the open. You can clearly see that she's not over this other guy. Don't try to intervene or speak of her mess. Really, just stop caring about what she had with this other guy. The only thing you can and should do is watch and see how she handles it on her own. You might learn something more about her.     A sudden change of heart might be to much for her right now. Remain her friend and be there for her. Ask her if she needs help. Actually, just tell her you will help her. Again, try not to talk about relationships she might get the wrong message thinking you want to know just so you could manipulate you way "in". So get those negative thoughts out of her head and build new ones with kindness and friendship. Instead of putting up a fascade wall, refuging, thinking, and "sorting" your feelings be rational about your choices rather than being unhelpfully emotional.    Don't dwell and think about what you should have done, but think about what you will do.|`|byD5VO2baa	sounds like you're giving her mixed messages.     you can't say that you like her but then you need space. and when she gives you space, you can't expect her to sit around and wait for you.     if you want to be with her, be with her...if it's getting too serious, slow it down, but that can be done without asking for space. asking for space is like asking to take a break.     don't you remember what happened when ross and rachel took a break?!    just be honest with your feelings with her. get it out in the opinion. if you want to be with her, tell her. she probably still thinks you want your space, which probably means to her that she has space that can be filled by her exes.

C'est la vie en ralit !   voici une chanson de Florent Pagny       " Savoir Aimer "     Savoir sourire,   une inconnue qui passe,  N'en garder aucune trace,  Sinon celle du plaisir  Savoir aimer  Sans rien attendre en retour,  Ni gard, ni grand amour,  Pas mme l'espoir d'tre aim,    {Refrain:}  Mais savoir donner,  Donner sans reprendre,  Ne rien faire qu'apprendre  Apprendre  aimer,  Aimer sans attendre,  Aimer  tout prendre,  Apprendre  sourire,  Rien que pour le geste,  Sans vouloir le reste  Et apprendre  Vivre  Et s'en aller.    Savoir attendre,  Go?ter  ce plein bonheur  Qu'on vous donne comme par erreur,  Tant on ne l'attendait plus.  Se voir y croire  pour tromper la peur du vide  Ancre comme autant de rides  Qui ternissent les miroirs    {Refrain}    Savoir souffrir  En silence, sans murmure,  Ni dfense ni armure  Souffrir  vouloir mourir  Et se relever  Comme on rena?t de ses cendres,  Avec tant d'amour  revendre  Qu'on tire un trait sur le pass.    {Refrain}    Apprendre  rver   rver pour deux,  Rien qu'en fermant les yeux,  Et savoir donner  Donner sans rature  Ni demi-mesure  Apprendre  rester.

I wouldnt ask her about moving in for awhile though, that might freak her out. With not knowing what shes doing when shes out, thats just a risk you have to take with anyone..its hard.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Hey Steph,    I think that its good for a woman to have a level of being self-efficent and being able to take care of themselves, but if they want to be a partner in a realtionship, especially a marriage, then they have to also be able to sacrifce, compromise and depend on someone besides themselves at times as well. I like strong women and find the traits you mention as being very attractive, but I've also had challenges in a few relationships with women who were so self-efficent that they never need help with anything... and as a previous poster said, men have it coded into their dna to be protective of women... going back to our days in caves hunting.     Hope that give you some prespective,    Dan|`|9IjciQpjaa	guys are naturally protective of their girls....but if he can do it herself its a good thing...we'll be there when she needs us

NQFV2AdZaa	I think he likes you a lot but he's too shy to admit it to you and also may be worried about what his friends may say if they found out. <br>  <br>  Just carry on being friendly with him and even thank him for not joining in with the teasing when he was with his friends. Also when he did tease you when you were both alone together, i think he was just playing with you and didn't mean to irritate you, but just tell him if he ever oversteps the mark, good luck!|`|wzAKIsQBaa	He probably does like but hes scared to admit it.
oUtEVKDHaa	Since you answered mine I will answer yours!<br>  <br>  In my opinion yes it's wrong. Number one If I were your friend and had intentions of hooking up with a your ex I'd first consult it with you because you may still have feelings for him and what not. Did you tell her how you felt about him. If you gave them the "carefree" attitude that's what probably what led them to continue. Not justifiable though. At this point there's not much you CAN do. If it bothers you that much you should stop talking to her to avoid any contact with him and seeing them together. That must be tough because you still have feelings for this guy and she's your friend. Avoid contact with them until you can resolve your feelings. Or talk to her and let her know what bothers you. Maybe you two can come up with something to make each other feel better and you can still be friends. Good luck.
t0rSnomXaa	your thinking too hard about it. he probly just wants someone to hang out and flirt with but doesnt feel the need to go out with you. he isnt mad at you because you arnt talking. its probly not even crossing his mind cuz thats how guys are, and hes probly giving you that impression. you should talk to him if you feel the need to . hes not ignoring you though.|`|54404f04beec50db9d09f28959179095aa	maybe he's just using you. i mean you say he flirts with you and looks at you but then he only wants to be friends, so maybe he's just using you or keeping you around til he does find someone that he wants to start a relationship with. that's what it seems like to me.

Ce sont des facteurs cls, dans une relation.  Les autres filles sont peut tre plus sympas?plus amoureuses?elles st peut tre plus dmonstratives?moins collantes?plus sexy?plus chics?plus dr?les?

Et je pense qu'il pourrait prouver de la tendresse pour chacune d'elles, mme de l'amour, si son univers ne bascule pas  un moment.

Cheaters are players and thats a fact, dont fall in love, just play them back. Revenge is never good. I may be a grl, but never let a grl play you like that. You dont wanna look stupid. Or just CONFRONT her. Ask her what the **** is going on? I hope anything i said helped or gave you any idea what you could or is you should trust her. I really want to know what happens though.

He wouldn't lie unless it were a white lie which explains why he was initially being an a**. If you think the whole situation just complicates things even more than you were without him just forget him. Stop caring about how he feels without you. You left him and therefore he's no longer your responsibility, but a nuisance. There are plenty of great people out there who are in the same age range as you.

N1xr43seaa	Even if people say love is blind,yet it's the best you can find.I don't know what you really mean by "really i love this guy",b'cos if you really love the guy,then you don't need to feel shy to walk with him.The truth might be bitter,but i tell you LOVE itself has d power that conquereth all.According to Dr.Martin Luther King,Jr he said "Love is the most durable power in the world....Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend".Sorry my dear,but this is my advice,it is a challenge which you yourself has to overcome.Don't be shy again to walk with him,express your feelings about how your family and friends feel to him.Then express the love you had for him like never before,let people criticize, but you continually do what you have to do.Then they will all know that you truly love him.Love means happiness and more, so think about if you let their criticism make you to loose your love.How is it going to affect you...Who knows maybe they are trying to find out how much you love him.So you see that there is no true love without challenges and trial.And i pray you have the power to overcome,cos true love itself will strengthen you.And finally i will use this medium to enlighten people that we should always say no to all form of racism.I believe we are one.We must all learn to live together as brothers.or we will all perish together as fools|`|bde014a8de70530beac8c5f4caaa598faa	dont go i just say dont go|`|2f5133b4b3f8053e316f8a85fa3fe8e7aa	an african and an asian !

I will tell you love supports all, even some eyes without love!  ask yourself! if you will continue to be with him, if you really love him, love support all ! as I say!

I have been in your situation, and understand how hard it is to accept the reality of it all. But if you take a step back and look at it from outside, you'll realize that when people are confronted with brutal truth and honesty, they often respond with brutal truth and honesty, even if we choose not to accept it.     If he said that he cared for you, but not in the same way that you care for him, that is more than likely what he really means.

4822c6117eed8ae9a7125b6b13313327aa	Ok Honey,Relax.I know this is upsetting........ First of all, I want to tell you that you are good daughter,student, and person! Dont ever let anyone make you feel less than that!   Your parents made a choice not to go to your grandfather's.There is nothing really stopping them from going! From the sounds of it.. you are probably 18.A responsible adult who has always been forthright and honest her parents.Never a trouble maker and probably has never even given them a sleepless night over anything! Their only reason is... to stay behind and watch you..... even though 99 percent of america would have left you alone  for the weekend without a second thought!! There is no way! that is your fault! Trust me!  I could only imagine how heart wrenching it was to miss your prom! Having a second chance to go to one is definitly something you should do and not feel guilty one bit for your parents 'WANTING' to stay behind.   You literally have 2 choices on how to resolve this matter!  1. Tell your parents that you are an adult now and are legally capable of making your own decisions and go against their wishes!  On a side note: If your worried about them saying "It is my house and these are my rules if you dont like it them.. leave!" Just keep in mind that they are trying to keep an eye on you over something as silly as a prom.Do you really think they are going to make you move out into a world were they have no control? I think Not  2. You could do what most students do and that is to Lie! Lie! Lie! Your staying with So and SO and SO and SO is staying with you.   Either way.... I know this is hard for you .Im sorry you lost your brother.I lost mine a few years ago.But youll be okay! I promise! Good Luck and Enjoy your Prom!|`|51133c547f5ded40026a28aa2b43995daa	hun thats alot to read. talk to ur parents tell them u dont want there plands ruined cuz of ur plans. and everything else u feel
AA11136356	It's all in what you think.  You have control of your thoughts whether you're willing to accept that responsibility or not.  But you must accept that and begin to focus on the positive.  Your problem stems from focusing on all the possible negative outcomes.  You choose your reality.  You've chosen one that has made you feel a mess.  You could blame that on circumstances, like an accident or your upbringing or whatever.  Bottom line, the past is the past and you have to decide that you are becoming more and more positve each day.  Forgive yourself and others for the past.  By doing so you free yourself up to embrace the future as it comes toward you each and every day.   Make a list of your positive traits and focus on those as your reason for knowing that you'll be successful in college.  EACH and EVERY day spend several minutes sitting still, close your eyes and envision the positive outcome that you know you deserve.  Look at the availability of all that we as humans have and know that you were put here too to be successful.  To feel successful.  By faithfully repeating these sessions of positive energy you will by the force of creativity lodged in your subconscious mind, bring them into being.  I'm glad you were brave enough to ask.  Now be brave enough to accept the responsibility for managing your thoughts.  You get what you focus on.  Focus on Success and it will be yours.|`|ecda794e799ac0924144fb56cfb9a42eaa	It's a proven fact that people that are hurting ,hurt   Other people.  I myself also used to be very negative and I learned to just quit it and think positive about myself and others.  The one thing that helped me the most is I surrendered my life.  To my Lord Jesus Christ, and that helped me a lot|`|89aPz3d4aa	I used to be really mean to people too.  Just cause I was a really small kid and got picked on  a lot.  I figured I'd hurt them worse than they could hurt me.  Problem was, it never helped me in the least.  One day I just grew up and figured it out.  You seem to be on the right track with your thinking at this young age.  Just always ask yourself "What does this person's opinion matter anyway?"  Then you won't take it personally and you won't hurt them back.    You seem to be fairly intelligent so focus on your good points.  And really look within yourself to find them.  And maybe consciously stop and think before you start giving TMI to people.|`|6DUz3aHzaa	You have everything in the world...everything that matters in life. Don't ever forget that ....You ....r you & you must love you.... A lot of times you need to see beyond the outer structure of a building to see if it will stand. It could have termites!!!!   SO ...........don't judge too soon you could be very wrong!!!!!     Dreams come true to those that believe in those dreams .Hope is always there even after the fact!  Doesn't mean your dreams won't change but you have to have faith in what you believe. Make sure you have a clear picture. Our past will always play a part in what we believe in as people but that can change too as we  grow & learn& make mistakes. And its OK to make mistakes.
QZ2DH1BEaa	If you insist on getting a tan: Lay in a tanning bed.....for "5" minutes "only" every other day for a week  (4 times). The second week "8" minutes...... the third week "11" minutes.   The fourth week  14...and so on. Adding three minutes each week until you reach 15/16 minutes.. after that continue at 15 minutes every other day....until you reach the color your after.  You will not see any tanning the first week- but it is there.   Don't get burned. The burn is what changes the skin....and when your older....it "will" show.     Don't use any accelerators, or bronzers in the tanning bed/booth...  Do.....moisturize with a good product after wards.    You'll be a safe and golden brown in no time.|`|4d8yOK3iaa	For one thing we have a lot less of an ozone layer than we used to, and you can put yourself at risk of skin cancer. I prefer tannining beds. When you go to start tanning it is always best to start out a couple minutes for the first week, and then gradually move up. Because if  you tan the full time your first time  you will burn really bad. It usually takes about eighttimes before your tan gets really noticeable. Also when you have tanned and gotten your base tan start using a lotion with a bronzer. That will enhance your tan.|`|938aefe2015bdad9a64549c10e00812eaa	The sun is bad for your skin!  You should try to avoid it if at all possible, or use a heavy duty sunblock!  Do you want to look 60 when you are 30?|`|cfOMv1Wyaa	Why is this question listed under singles and dating?|`|PUZBI7Biaa	because your skin changes as you get older..if you are burning alot i would not suggest that you try to tan so much..couldn't u wear some sun protection but still try to tan so that you would have some protection without exposing yourself 100% to the damaging sun rays..u know they say that one bad burn in ones life puts one at risk for skin cancer...self tanners work very too the Jergens one makes me look like i hit the tanning bed|`|bbdd04ea110dc1e385c4f5c435ef3216aa	I really do not recommend tanning in the sun or in a tanning bed.  Both are extremely bad for your skin.  You may end up with skin cancer later on in life.  It is definitely not worth it.  What I do recommend is a product by Dove which is a tanning creme you can put on every day.  It really works, and it works fast!  The result is a nice brown, rather than orange like other sunless tanners.  Be safe!|`|POgRH4Hpaa	Well I think you either need to lay out in the sun or lay in the tanning bed everyday for one week straight. Yes you will burn and it will hurt but after the burn in gone you will start tanning very well. Then all you have to do is maintain it by laying once or twice a week! Good Luck!|`|5BqtwTjiaa	instead of putting on sunscreen or sunblock, try putting on suntan lotion. its hard to get tan if youre caucation by the way
9Z8YMQ4saa	We got a hotel room after our prom...((one of your friends big sisters rented the room for us))    Some of our friends had the same problem you had...they had a later dinner/dessert at like Denny's...some went to the movies...some went miniature golfing...or went to someone's house and they all had a movie night after prom with a big sleepover...    There's plenty to do..just depends on what you guys like to do.
RlBvBarOaa	before the prom ends you can vote on who should be prom queen. And after the prom you can talk about so and so's dress and how good, cute, or plain ugly.  You can vote for your own prom queen to.
AA11803569	yea if you're the type to still be friends than loose them completly. if you've been going for that long, it'd be best to layback off your ex for about a week then start talking again, kinda just to get the old vibes off.    but as for best friends, it'd take a while to get back to "best-friends" status.|`|W3HQwrgBaa	HELL NO GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|c3XuZcu5aa	no no no, its not even a little bit possible.|`|BlGztRDiaa	Yes one of my friends had dated her boyfriend for 3 years, after they broke up they stayed best friends for years to come. They have been friends for 14 years after the breakup.|`|sqZQXa13aa	yes only if she/he agresse with it|`|AA11730887	Well, anything is possible, but from experience, your relationship will probably never be the same. Hopefully your "relationship" ended peacefully. In that case, if both parties are level headed, you can still be friends, yes, but anything above that would just be lucky, there will be feelings, and memories that will be hard to get past.|`|hYO4BrQLaa	Its pathetic to lose a friendship over a break-up unless there is a reason.... its better you be best friends with your ex than enemies!!! ive had both and the bad ones always do little things to rub it in your face that theyre not yours anymore ... and the friends are good to have because when you need help ... they know so much about you because they were with you for a part of your life... be wise about this decision... and be prepared to experience some odd feelings.... make sure he wants what you want :)|`|zmXVwXEJaa	yes , it is possible at any event of time in your life.
57fcd7c84ade66e5eaaa880537608617aa	yeah its pretty normal. that's what happens when people grow up. life comes into a different focus. friends change and  shift and new alliances are formed and new bonds are forged. its just life and we have to learn how to deal with it. in my opinion ur perfectly normal. i wouldn't worry about it. besides college is the time for new beginnings anyway|`|51eb8d219433fe817252e3456f4a680baa	senior year is the year where you see who your real friends. mostly everybody from my class drifted apart. everyone was doing their own thing. thats just part of growing up we have to say goodbye to people we love the most.|`|5pYV9go1aa	I was in the same position you were just in! I was looking through my middle school photos and couldn't believe how much those memories were still here with me and how much I missed them. They never seem to fade! It's almost like you have high expectations that getting older means things get better. They do, but certainly not in high school. Middle school is where great memories are made (for some people), and when the memories from there don't compare to high school and things just aren't as fun, you begin to question yourself and what you're doing or not doing. Yes, you have friends now and they want to go out, but you, like me, refuse simply becuase there's really no urge too. This is completely normal, and it's called growing up. Best friends should be around forever, at least the good ones. But if you talked to them last year and not this year, it's not because they see you in a different way but because the way they have matured and grown is different from you, and perhaps you're personalities no longer correlate, meaning they weren't friends, but rather acquaintances. A friend will understand you're going through changes. You see senior year as not such a great time - it's quite bland. But don't let that bring you down! You have you're entire life ahead of you. The life expectancy is close to 90, so why let one year faze you? It's totally a cliche or at least a "80s-90s" thing where people thought the world of senior year. Right now, senior year just means the last year you have to deal with such people that aren't true friends and those you simply don't want to hang out with. But if things are like this after an event has happened (perhaps something sad) then maybe you're depressed, but if not, as I've said, this is completely normal. Don't alienate yourself, and never have expectations too high about something because if it doesn't meet them, you'll be let down. Always see the good in situations like these - you find out who your real friends are, and you find out who you are. Life is beautiful, so live it! Don't base it or become sad over an overrated year.|`|c2lXRK2taa	Of course it is. In fact, Its healthy. Make sure you stay close to them, but the less you hang out, the less you will be heartbroken when you all go to college. Yes, it is a hard thing. Spend time with them amap (as much as possible), but make sure you realize life will change durastically soon. You'll meet new people. If you prefer, choose your BFF, and stay very close. Kepp them as a good friend to help you cope through college and senior summer. :) Good luck, hang in there, kiddo.|`|s0vkcxAtaa	You may be pulling away from others because of depression from unwelcome change in your life. Don't devote all of you energy in your boyfriend. Friends will still be there when he is long gone. Sometimes drifting away is just natural. After I left high school, I didn't keep a single friend. But I met people in college that I've kept as friends for 20 years. But don't let yourself get isolated. Try to find some activity that you enjoy that doesn't involve relying on your boyfriend. Either do a sport or join a school activity or volunteer at your local library to shelve books, or do something that you are interested in and will bring you in to contact with people.|`|dxvKc7xsaa	I think it is totally normal, you are at an age where things are changing rapidly.  I remember my senior year, and I was so glad to be graduated and move on to greener pastures.  If you are going to college, you will love it!  The people are more mature, the classes have less busy work, and there are many groups you could join to meet new friends.    Even if you are not going to college, life gets a lot better after graduation.  You grow apart with your old friends because you are more mature yourself, and you learn a lot about yourself and what you really want to do with your life.  I would say the best way you can spend your life is by getting a good job, and making the friends that would be the best influences.
c801c750a22ea6cbd91f3010914ee8beaa	Don't worry-- this is perfectly normal.  Sure, there's a lot of hype about that last year of high school, how it's supposed to be the best time of your life, but it's also a huge time of change and of stress, trying to figure out what to do next.  You have already identified two people who are important to you and worth your time, and if it feels like an effort to get together with old friends, don't do it.  To be perfectly honest, college, or whatever you do next, will change your whole social world anyway.  I actually think most people make their lifelong friends in college, not high school.  (And most high school relationships don't survive college, just to warn you.)  Don't put so much pressure on yourself to have the "perfect" year-- just do things you enjoy with people you enjoy, and look forward to the future.|`|ibDwQE9jaa	Well like you i have the same problem. I have a boyfriend i and feel like at the moment i can only trust him. I mean i have drifted from my friends because i feel a little more mature and grown up. They still are the ones who will B**** about every second thing behind your back. If you really do love your friends you should organise a girls night or something. Because friends really are the most important thing. A Boy might leave you but friends are forever. I suggest you make sure you let your friends know that you still love them. Because sometimes they might feel that you love your boyfriend more, and that he matters more. Keep them even..........

Do you care enough for him to take a chance and wait? Is he worth the wait? Are you thinking about the relationship or just about YOUR feeling? You must be really suffering and I think you will continue to suffer in all of your relationship unless you try and do something about yourself. Talk to someone you trust and confide in. Let it all come out, free yourself, free yourself now. Good Luck|`|87caae414c79709b703edebd99c31d14aa	He's a jerk and you're better off without him.  I'm sorry, and I know that you feel horrible, but there is nothing that you can do.  I can tell you that it's nothing that you did.  He was probably thinking about breaking up before that, and he was just using it as an excuse.  Wait and someone better will come along.  He's not worth the effort.    Trilli.|`|VeYitemvaa	dont let him do that to you. that not right, you deserve a lot better than that. if he is gunna tell you that he needs two weeks but you cant wait that long and he goes billistic, he thinks he has full control over the relationship. show him that he is wrong
C9LCSmVjaa	yes when ur in luv u want 2 tell the world evedentlly ur not. stay home , break up.
AA11787828	Sounds to me like John is trying to tell you not to feel badly about what happened between you and your ex. He's also trying to tell you that the ex is not the normal and that there are guys like him (considerate and loving) out there. He thinks that the ex did you wrong. Keep searching!|`|S4cPTjP5aa	sounds to me like john is a sweet guy who cares for you although probably not romantically and it sounds like he likes you over your ex!! he sounds like a good friend!|`|20bf5c1c261752a213e0e525811425a2aa	That he's a jerk.
l74NZvQNaa	I don't know if you work closely with him at work, or if you just happen to see him there. But, he could make trouble for you later on down the road if you stay, as in he could spread rumors and such. But, also it sounds like you might be a bit freightened of him. I think if you feel that uncomfortable you should look for a new job. But, then again if you rarely see him and it's not a huge nuisance, than I would stay...I mean hey he could be looking to leave the company too.|`|EJmlrpVHaa	go to the interview and see how it goes. I know you like the other job but it will be very hard on you to have to see him everyday. You have to distant yourself from this person because you will always live the abuse if you see it everyday. He is a reminder of the hurt you feel inside. I am telling you this from experience. Start new somewhere else. Move forward.|`|nqOSio2caa	This sort of thing happened to a friend of mine. If he has really caused you that much grief, then being round him all the while will remind you of it. I'm not going to tell you what to do though as that is your decision, and anyone trying to make your mind up will not help you.    Think it over as its a big decision     Good luck in whatever choice you make :)|`|AA10950302	Thats tough. If there isnt much interaction with the guy, then it would probably be okay for you to stay. But if you see and talk to him everyday then I would suggest going for that other job.     Your case is even more proof that jerks always get girls. It pisses me off to hear stories like this because I would never do that to a girl yet no one will give me a chance. But whatever, if you girls want to be abused and controlled and hurt, whatever.
ah7qo4o8aa	hello im erica and i would like to answer your question  i just got out of an relation ship just like that, i would say the bet thing for you to do is leave theres no point of blowing your self off like that, if he wasnt as good to you as you were to him then theres no point of running back a man or boyfriend can never make you as happy as you can thats from the heart there was a time when i was tired of getting hurt made you should to write back anytime|`|CtVLaAZRaa	I think you should leave this relationship behind and chalk it up as a learning experience. In the future do not let yourself get so worked up into someone else that you let your own life disappear.   A man likes a confident woman who has her own activities and interest. In the long run it is better for the relationship.
AA11658856	You deserve love and respect.  Moving on might be hard, but necessary.  Good luck!|`|SN9gY4Toaa	I don't know why you would be "scared" to see him especially if he has never made you feel threatened in any way, maybe because you know deep down that it really isn't going to work out between you two and Sunday will truly be the end.  The biggest question you should have is "How could I value myself so little that I would let this jerk treat me like this and actually beg him to take me back??"|`|YIMZB9Znaa	i think your coming to terms that he really isnt worth it but u dont want him to tell you to your face, theres 2 things to this:  1 he needed some time away to think about the relationship and if its what he whats and the only way of telling you was insulting you and that does happen with guys the dont no how to say i need space so they lash out at the one the love or  2 he is telling you the truth and if he is girl he is just playing you go to meet him and act like "you dont care what he says eirther way u win" if he says sorry for all he said tell him u want time to thing and do go think about it, is he worth all the heartachce and if u get back together i hope your happy but a guy saying that no matter what he'd wanna b on his knees begging for forgivness!! do go meet him and then tell him you think its best u both spend a good bit of time away from each other and go do it then youll have time to think about what u really want!!|`|mAesN18Oaa	no person derserves to be spokent o in any horrible way   especially from someone who was supposed to love you   are you sure you want to see him     let him come to you let him see if he loves you   your afraid because part of you proberly knows the answer

Many people are painfully shy. Hopefully you have an interest -- hiking, birdwatching, volunteer work, whatever -- that you can find others with similar likings. Look in the Yellow Pages under Clubs or Organizations or some such. How about the Sierra Club or Audubon Society? The Red Cross? A homeless shelter?|`|cOQBz6Eeaa	I don't live in a small town but I know how you feel.  Alot of times the thoughts we have in our heads about ourselves are much worse than the thoughts we fear others are having in their head about us.    How about volunteering somewhere?  Is there something you like to do? Is there a cause you are interested in supporting? Sometimes volunteering your time to something you are interested in will put you in touch with others who would make great new friends to hang out with.      Whatever you do, don't feel bad about yourself and your shyness.  Social phobias are on the rise. You're not alone in that, even if it feels like it. Accept who you are right now and take small steps out of your comfort zone.     Another suggestion would be to buy a notebook.   Keep a journal/diary of your progress. You can write little exercises or create check lists in there for you to accomplish.  Like set a goal of smiling at four people the next time you go out shopping. Check off how many you smiled at.  Write down if they smiled back or looked at you like you were crazy.   Write down how it made you feel (the ones who smiled back at you and the ones who didn't).   Write down a goal of saying "hi", "what's up" or "good morning" to four people you don't know.  Write down how it went and what were the responses.  That's a start on helping you become more social.    Good luck and God bless.  .

She is going to do what she has intended to do It is going to hurt but every time you see her it is going to set you back and you will always hurt. You need to heal first because I think deep down you are hoping she will change her mind and want to get back with you. Don't touchier yourself on a glimpse of hope. Go through the healing process then become friends. Trust me Ive been there a few times. It stinks but I have learned this is what works for me.|`|2aeedeb8d3228616fd5d0433433d237caa	I know how you feel. Just hang out with her as friends and move on and find someone else to date.The Right person is still out there for you.You don't know yet it .|`|ccf57d58883eba586b7992799b9b4766aa	Trust me on this one.  Find a new friend.  I wasted a substantial portion of my youth on a girl that dumped me and then wanted to be just friends.  In the long run you get hurt a lot as she continues dating other people, and they really do mean it when they say that all they want is to be just friends.  I've never had one return to me yet.  Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|dad133297ac7427018b0a3f4df2058e6aa	if you said you'll hang out just as friends you have to keep your word.|`|AA11301063	dude im goin through the same thing, BUT dont hang out with her as friends, it will drive you NUTS.. no matter how strong you feel about this girl, the only thing to do is get over her by 1) not contacting her at all (no phone calls, no emails, no msn) and tryna distract yourself, either with friends or some new girll.. but you will just frustrate yourself if you keep hanging around her.. sorry but its the truth|`|AA11545844	It is true that girls (or guys) want what they can't have. If you act like you don't care as much as you actually do, but don't be a jerk about it, it will make her realize how much she misses you.  Don't make yourself available to her everytime she calls.|`|a5ffc5fdf9515aeb104dc08ced9ff554aa	You should blow her off.  Look.  She doesn't want to be with you.  Whatever happened happened and you'll just have to find someone else.  If you truly do respect her then you'll respect her feelings and move on.  Hanging out with her is a bad idea.  Your intentions are far from hanging out as friends.  You've lied to her, and you're trying to abuse the time that she wants to give you.  You need to realise that.  You need to call her and say something has come up, then go out with your friends or look at myspace or whatever you do when you're on the prowl.
8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	You should probably ask you mom about this.|`|21e3557a770dcaec953c193e39c5255baa	It does have mild side effects,  It is a completely anonymous process,  It will not prevent STDs like AIDs,  It must be taken on schedule every day,    Its unlikely you are ready if you are too embarrassed to ask your doctor these questions.|`|hjT4Tco5aa	Go to www.plannedparenthood.org and you can get more facts than you can get here.|`|f3a95504656b151d31f4d9253186324daa	well the pill or any other form of birth control is not 100% effective. lets just make that clear it also doesnt protect from aids, or stds, so you just need to be careful, um you do need to schedual an apointment with your doctor for that annual test and then you can talk to your doctor about birth control then. they will pretty much tell you anything you need to know.|`|bc3pTKOaaa	birth control pills are pretty simple.. ive been taking them for about a year now. you can use them to regulate your period, or incase you are sexually active... you have to take one pill every night, its better to do it at the same time, but you dont have to. Make sure you ask your doctor about what to do if you miss a pill or something just in case, with my birth control if i miss a pill then i just take it as soon as i remember, but im not sure if all pills are like that.. so make sure you find out what to do. To get birth control you have to go to your gynecologist and get a check up and ask about getting birth control.. there  are different types you can get, like the patch and shots and stuff.. but idk about any of that, i prefer the pill.        hope i helped!|`|L5ytxvlpaa	I'm using the patch right now (its called EVRA), which is a form of birth control.  To get it, I had to get a physical done at my doctors office, where she does a pap smear, takes your blood pressure and just checks your health to see if birth control is right for you.    The patch is just a sticky piece of plastic (no bigger than the size of your palm), which you can place on your body (limited to arms, stomach, thighs).  And the hormone that prevents pregancies will get absorbed into your bloodstream.    I prefer the patch, because I only have to change it once a week and I get the same protection as the birth control pill (which is not 100% btw).  I had alot of problems remembering to take the pill everyday AND at the same time, so changing the patch is alot easier to remember.      Also...there are alot of side effects of the pill/patch because hormones are being put into to prevent pregnancies.  I also didnt like the pill because it made me gain weight and made me really moody.  with the patch I havent been having those side effects, so I am happy with that.  However, it could be just because of the brand that I was taking.  Everyone has a different body and will react differently to the hormones.    When you go to your family doctor to get medicine, they always write it down in your chart esp if their prescribing you.  If youre worried that your parents find out or something...those files are pretty confidential!    Hope that helps!|`|ok8HEDxmaa	I would suggest not taking it. I'm not a woman, but my girlfriend was on it and she didnt like the negative effects it had on her body and mood.
7d8edeb4c744bfc69b2e259a71fe25ddaa	Try it....see if it works.  If it doesn't, it's not meant to be.  What's the worst that could happen?    Good luck!|`|IySxVM2daa	Well the ? here is do you like her? If your not sure or don't really know her then just go for it. But i would talk to your friends first if they say not to THEN DONT.   Good luck and i hope things work out for you|`|eE79f8ZYaa	Do you like her? If yes, say yes. If not/maybe, don't play with her emotions, when it comes to doing things with her, if you feel uncomfortable, it will show and hurt her.    If you are going to reject, say you would really love if you guys could get to know each other a bit better and be friends.|`|YvFEKNheaa	if you like her then you should if not tell her you don't nicely.

1a3f68d9213a2d926f0184a15bac5e46aa	they might be, but i dont trust girls that continue to talk to exes. I think if you break up thats it, but it might just be a friendshp. Question is, did she tell you or did you have to find out this? Good luck :)

That they're just trying to get into my pants. It depends, though, what the question is. If they're asking about something that has nothing/little to do with me (i.e. how do you feel about...uh...bondage in xxx movies), I don't care either way.    2. Depends on the person. If it's a friend, then I laugh it off and mess with them. If it's a guy I like, well... :)
AA10037504	Start occupying yourself at night...get out of the house and around others that care about you.    Don't start seeing someone new yet...your break up is too fresh for that. You would end up talking about your ex too much. Just chill, find new interests but not a new date....yet.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	DRINK>>>>>>>>>>>>>>LOTS|`|f153bd57c980e0c98e5f41a1c60066bfaa	People will tell you that you need to find someone else or go drinking or spend all your time with friends but that only last a little bit, after it all you still have the heart ache. You need to do what you want to do, If you want to throw something, do it. If you want to punch something, do it. If you feel like screaming,  do it till you cant speak. You need to find your own closure. You must always remember the words "its over". It helped me.|`|f14b5f3530da79ae6c6ce69e166d446baa	I know that its hard to get over someone and it will take time...but think about it..maybe theres a reason why that u guys broke up..like you said if you gyys were ditsnat it wasnt the right relation ship for you. It always takes time to get over these types of things but you know what..theres definetly the right girl for you and than you wont have to worry about loosing her. Love is hard...but you have to keep on trying until you find the right one. So i wish u look and i hope u feel better, And out of al the different answers ur going to get i hope u find the perfct way for u to be happy and even happier than ever. :)|`|1b95837615855ef29efeff9f1a5e62b5aa	It takes time... maybe find your self a new hobby for night times. see how many points you can get up on this thing... or go out to d pubs.. go to d cinema....

I know it seems impossible but time is the greatest healer of all!|`|AA11307676	honey it takes time to get over someone just be patient it will happen dont sit and dwell on her get out there and have some fun ok|`|4660f6d58307d2f58e1a821ba97d3474aa	why not be just friends? it works. just don't think about how much you LOVE her, think about how much you CARE about her.|`|cea749a66f9da11700cfd5c4fe2ab38eaa	perform yoga or tell her that u cannot live without her|`|5a0740fe68e363ee5e499d9c1b0a715aaa	Dude, you pulled the trigger on the relationship, but frit.  HOBBIES.    Don't go back to something you know is not going to work.  That's backwards thinking.|`|22282e903205a600c9b0412b8dd5085faa	Break ups are hard, no doubt about it. Problem is you can't spend all your time with family, friends or at work. At some point you have to be alone and that is the toughest time.  My advice is to watch movies or read books or anything that you can do when alone that will take your mind off her.  Maybe getting back together is the answer. Ask yourself...am I happier with her or without her? If the answer is with her then consider giving it another go.  Also, how is she handling the breakup?
f31f43270e99a5a98529cf6d86046dedaa	I don't know what tell ya, it seems you know the answer to your question yourself and it hasn't worked, obviously. The truth you can't, that feeling will still be there as long as she is around. And if nothing is gonna happen, why waste time. Move on, as hard as it may be, it is something you have to do. For you. Be strong and live life for, because if you keep thinking about it 24/7 itll come to the point where you feel like she's youre only reason for living and you don't want that. Live for you. Now if someone else comes along, that's good. Cliche maybe, but let nature take its course. Don't go crazy looking for love either, someone, in time will come along, someone who will return the love you have for her. As for the girl you are in love with now, I think you should stop seeing her...talk to her, let her know that it kills you to be with her and that you can't just be friends. It'll do you good not seeing her...you can't let this situation take over your life. I wish you luck and think positive. :) Peace.|`|biCG2zNEaa	sh*t, i know exactly how you feel. I'm trying to get over a guy right now. and i havent cracked yet, albeit it's only been about 3 days for me. but because i dont have any phone credit that helps too. I feel sorry for you, i cant believe she just fell out of love with you, in fact i dont believe it. get to the bottom of this situation, there might be more going on than your realise. but this is what i've been doing , writing letters, just write a letter to her telling her everything that you feel and that you want her to know, and then when you're done, rip it up. it's pretty fun, because you can say whatever you want safe in the knowledget that she'll never read it. good luck|`|AA10333997	if u cnat get her out of ur head maybe she is ment to be there|`|df476ae5337144c1bdd2c272e989ab21aa	I know that this sounds weird, but I was in the same situation recently and every time I started thinking about her I told myself, "She doesn't want me, she doesn't want me", over and over and it worked for me.  By the second day of doing this I started feeling better.  Good luck.|`|qV4GIwWIaa	Just hold strong. I fell in love with a girl and we had to break up  while we were still in love. It's been about 7 months and I still can't get it all out of my head. It hurts like hell and hard to do but you just gotta keep going. THe best advice I can give is to start talking to her and treating her like a friend. It helps. Once you get used to the fact that she's a friend, nothing more, it may take a load off of your mind. I know it's a hard thing to do. If she really wants to be a friend then ask her for help. That's what friends are for|`|VqY7hMEjaa	relax and tell  to  yourself that  you love her, tell  your friends  how good she is and  how you  love her and crashed on her. soon you  will  try to  find something opposite about her :)))) and will  be tired of thinking of her, and finally fed  up  of your love enough to  start cool out of madness :)))) that  how mind works, opposite reaction!  That  takes time and not so  easy  but  it is faster and works really well.  Then more emotions and feelings you show up  then faster it gone :))))|`|zfVTEcQPaa	there def a porblem u need to think about this maybe its a bad thing that u havent called her.Maybe she should be sestained in ur mind and maybe she doesnt want to leave either. Or perhaps it really isnt ur mind talking.... no not that;.... but ur heart. You still feel for her y deny it. If things dont work out then im sure you will be fine cause no matter wat ud ppbly want her to b happy. Reflect back upon wat happened in the past with ur relationship, y did she fall in love with u and u with her... remeber those things and then ur golden. Show her u care and that you will always be there for her. If u cant get her out of ur mind but u dont want her as a gf she pplby needs to b a part of ur life in some way|`|jRBMvMycaa	It took me 3 solid months before I could make it through a day without feeling like I was losing my mind. Slowly, but surely time did it's magic and I started to get out and do things, before that I was like you - the distractions didn't work. Now years later, I'm fine. Still mad about some things, but that's it...there's no feeling. I don't see him though and we don't live in the same town.    One thing that I did during those first three months was to keep a small notebook and scribble down every thought...things I wanted to say to him, feelings, literal scribbles because of the pain. Then when I started feeling better, I tossed it.    So time is the answer....    Good luck!
X3vIFcsIaa	I would tell him in the future to keep things private or that you will stop sending those types of text messages.  He may just be bragging to his friends but he should respect your wishes.|`|BiIqbs3Taa	If after making it clear you dislike him sharing it with others he continues to show them off, send him a really hot text ending it with the question...why his peewee is so little? Hope he shows that one off to his friends.|`|c66fdcd68cc69b4677ecd57cf9705127aa	Just let him know that it makes you uncomfortable and ask him to stop.

I say it's just taking break in communicating. I'd say give it a break for awhile, and I mean WAIT awhile, she might contact you. I know it might eat you up inside to wait and not contact her, but after waiting a little while longer then reassure her. She will love it if she did have a grudge and If she questions you about not contacting her for awhile just say you were giving her her space because you thought she was mad at you.|`|73feLayCaa	Hey she's probably angry at you because some people hate to be stood up and as it is a long distant relationship there is a lot of why did u do dat and how could u but plz just call her a phone call wont kill u to make things right for both of u as from me i would say do it bro b4 its to late

You did the right thing by telling her that you should forgive each other and not hold grudges.Thanks to you because you have kept down your burden and forgiven her.You did the right thing though your friend does not see it that way.Open your eyes she is not interested in you and you should not force her.Look for new friends who take you as you are and who appreciate you.But i assure you that one day she will come begging for your forgiveness after she realizes what she is doing.All i can ask you is to be careful as you sound to be so sweet.Take care!|`|b3e18ba566904d719867a7b03e4a68c6aa	screw them. if you diddnt do anything she obviously wants your or something stupid. GET NEW FRIENDS|`|2b3ce017e44fc710cdff95320162d4e0aa	don't worry about it, find a new girl friend.      Go to a sperm bank, deposit your sperm and give her the deposit details with the following note:    'As I was planning to ask you to marry me, you simple started behaving like I have done something very wrong.  I don't know if I have enough courage now to ask you for the marriage, to ask you to be solely mine.      I don't know how long I can live like this.  All isolated and haunted for everything I did or didnot and do and donot.    In case you change your mind and decide to marry me and have our children, there is a chance that I might not be around anymore.  I have made this deposit so that you may still have our baby if you desire to do so and continue my lineage.      Cause its only you in the whole world who matters to me, if you reject, then nothing matters.'    Then simply enjoy life and let them do all the things for getting you back.

fygNGDCmaa	It goes without saying, things happen people change,<br>  <br>  Sometimes it just time and life in general people grow interest in new things losing the interest in something that held a connection with another.<br>  <br>  It just happens.|`|llgBLR6daa	i know what you mean. my friend and i now go to separate schools and grew apart. its weird how fast it happens, and unfortunately there's not much we can do about it.|`|hmnY2lhSaa	Lots of reasons.<br>  <br>  1. A big one is changing schools and graduating... new people, new relationships form- a lot of the time, better ones.<br>  2. Maturity. Everybody grows up... some not as fast as others.<br>  3. Media. As you get older, you start noticing the media more and start caring about that instead of other things. You start to care more about your appearance and who you are seen with, rather than the quality of friendship.<br>  4. As different peers change, many people try to change with them. Your best friend might want to be popular and start drinking early, but you don't... that's just one example.<br>  <br>  Really, I found my best friends in highschool.<br>  I guess its just a matter of finding out who never mattered, who will never matter, and who always will.<br>  It becomes even more apparent in grade 12<br>  :)
JppKTOPnaa	Well, honestly at 14 its really going to suck. The guy probably has no experience what so ever. If your not ready to support a child dont have sex, anything can happen. Why would you want to lose your virginity and not get paid for it. I saw on the news the other day some girl sold her virginity for a million dollars. Save it and make some big bucks. O yea and even though you are both young you can still get a disease, even with a condom.|`|AA11311675	If you've been dating for a while, then sure you can do it, but make sure he wears a condom!. Just dont give away your virginity to the first jerk you've only dated for a week.<br>  Good luck :]|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Wait till you're 18 at least<br>  The best is to wait till you're REALLY in love with someone and you have a commitment such as a ring on your finger (engagement or marriage)|`|wJGQtHuhaa	NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN<br>  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|AA11263103	no because you don't want to regret it. plus your too lazy to spell fourteen lol|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Don't do it. One night of fun isn't worth getting pregnant. You guys are not going to be together forever, and after you break up you will regret it and wish you had waited. Just don't.|`|ovDqPtg8aa	uh, no!<br>  you have much better things to do at 14 years old than have sex. <br>  if you do see your bf, do anything BUT sex ok?|`|N361k5Hsaa	birth control pills or condoms for u andd him|`|IQfaj1BGaa	hellllll nooooooooooooooooooo<br>  wtf would you want to do that<br>  <br>  you'll end up being another statistic and not help our generation of all this teenage nonsense|`|FejlYWMBaa	Yeah but he will probably tell people, even if you don't so you might get known as an "easy shagg" or something!|`|zFx7NT2Baa	There are lots of ways to have the pleasure of your sensual self that do not involve the possibility of getting pregnant.  I am ceratin you will find out how in other answers if you ask about bj or hj or fingeringl.  My most important thought is for you to think what his part of yourself is about it pleasure (yes) and being respectful to the guy too, and expect him to respect your needs too.|`|S852p6SXaa	your only 14 you have plenty of time to have sex, honestly i think you should wait until your at least 18 or older. cause you dont want to regret it and alot of girls do when that should be a re-memberable moment between you and your partner. you just wait it  out a couple more years, whats the rush?|`|ozqz1fW6aa	nooo|`|LYeDd9Y0aa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm NO|`|BbT3DCHvaa	No, No, No, No|`|PNCGiNhcaa	no thats stupid|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL YU DONT EVEN NO HW TO SPELL "PREGNANT" SOO IM GUESSING YU SHOULDNT DUE ANYTHING AND IF YU DO USE A CONDOM CUS I SURE AS HELL DONT Y TO POPULATE|`|qf0kuMCiaa	Well are you ready to take that chance? you may get become pregnant or get an STD or even worse. If you want to do it then make sure you protect yourself. My sister got pregnant at 14 so it can happen to you as well. I think you should wait. I tried it at 14 then my mom found out from my sister and my mom cried and cried over it. I felt so bad about it. I felt I let my mom down. So I only did it that one time and waited until I was 17 did it again and guess what I got pregnant with my son who is now 10 ..I still feel Like I should of waited .What we have is gold and Should share it with someone who we love and love us  back..14 is too young please think it over. I have two niece and a little sister . sisther is 13 she is having sex with everyone and my 11 niece is too it hurt me so bad because I cant stop them no matter how hard I try. So if I can stop you please let me be the one. After you do it I bet the guy will leave you.|`|uqMGjK4naa	Please don't do it.|`|wzAKIsQBaa	Didn't they teach you not to have sex until 18 in sex-ed???  Well like all the answers don't do and if you must or if he forces you to just use a condom and pray that it doesn't break, if it does pray that you don't pregnant.  Thats all I can say.  >.>|`|hKyOUVXIaa	If you are ready to carry, birth, pay for and care for a child, then go right ahead.

You should make sure you really love him and he loves you back because you're both so young and you might not even be sure of your feelings for each other. Besides, he might break up with you afterwards and you might feel different about yourself in a bad way. Just spare your innocence and everything while it lasts. Besides, you don't want to get pregnant either.|`|fFxGrhhTaa	It's your personal decision on that,but I know you understand that sex is a deeply bonding experience.Before you proceed,you need to think about how your boyfriend really feels about you.You are 14,yes that is young.Do you really see yourself with this same guy 5 years from now? Condoms can break.If you had a baby by him,do you think he will really be there to support you and your baby?Will he own up to the baby? If you have to set yourself back in education because you had his baby,what will he be doing?How long have you been with this guy,and is he older than you? If he is older than 18,I suggest u see what kind of man he is to see how long he will wait for you.There are lots of girls and women out there,you want to make sure you dont waste your virginity to an asshole.I personally think you should wait a little longer.You have your life and your well being to worry about.|`|xufESx85aa	You don't sound like you know much about practicing safe sex. Get informed before messing around, or you will probably end up with an STD and/or a baby.|`|KGBXcqAoaa	I really wouldn't if I were you. If you don't want to wait until marriage, then at least wait a few years...until you get a bit older. There are a ton of teenage girls getting pregnant, and it kills my heart to see that. I really wouldn't want you to have to go through that, at such a young age. <br>  And to tell you the truth, people will probably find out. And lots of girls will call you a skank, slut...etc.<br>  <br>  Please don't do it!|`|nDD9XTwzaa	If you have to ask us then no you shouldn't. You are under age and you really don't wanna get involved in adult stuff like this at 14, enjoy the rest of your childhood. I know a girl that was pressured into doing it at 14 by her boyfriend, and the next day he slept with another girl and because she had lost her virginity to him she didn't wanna dump him, but it messed her up pretty bad cause she was too young to deal with it all. And also you don't wanna risk getting pregnant so young|`|R65kAyVJaa	NO! Wait till your older. If your really temped, use a um... whatever they are called so you WON'T get pregnant. But still NO! NO! NO! Don't do it.|`|voTyeJexaa	hate to tell you this. but you arent ready for this. you wont realize it until after the fact. idk if you and he realize how much will change in your relationship. most teenagers arent ready for the emotional attatchment and, well, stress in a sense that having sex will cause. im not saying you're a bad person, a slut, skank, stupid, nothing like that. people that say those things are uneducated and immature. but i just want you to know that things will change when it happens and you need to be ready for those consequences of it. and so does he. just do yourself and hisself a favor and REALLY think about it. im not saying break up with him or anything like that but you do need to make sure you really understand whats gonna happen, because the experience (im assuming your guy is a virgin too) will be completely polar opposites for both of you. and in the end if you really werent ready, it could destroy something that you could have put off for a while andwaited till you were ready.<br>  <br>  If you MUST have sex, and just do it cause you want to, go to planned parenthood. they have condoms and birth control there. make sure your bf comes with you too. this is on him just as much as its on you and its just as much his responsibility<br>  <br>  i hope i've helped. and i just want you to make the best and smartest descision for you|`|Up4mqOINaa	You're never to young to start practicing sex.  The younger you start doing it, the better you will get at it.<br>  <br>  All this nonsense about "only do it if you are ready to have a child" is just bullshit.  There are these things we have nowadays called condoms.  What they do is they remove all the consequences of sex.  Use them and go do it.|`|ROE2AZydaa	Ok firstly, how old is your boyfriend, because if he sleeps with you and he is 16+ he is breaking the law. Something u need 2 be aware of is that sex changes alot of things,and can cause complications. If you really wanted 2 do it sweetheart u wouldnt need to ask if you should, for any1 that doesnt want an unplanned pregnancy there is contraception (condoms etc) and remember they can protect u from sexually transmitted infections. nobody can tell you whether to or not.can u talk 2 ur mom?|`|XOsAhyw6aa	no matter what anyone says on yahoo; youll do whatever you want.<br>  if you really want to have sex and dont want have to sex; use protection!<br>  <br>  goood luck:]|`|PtHkKEjTaa	Sure…only if you want a small litter before your 15! Anyways the guy most likely doesn’t love you just wants your pants. If you do have sex you’ll feel like you’re worth zilch. Then he will be telling his friends that you guys "did it" and his friends will tell their friends and before you know it you'll be the school whore on the bathroom stalls with a permanent marker! Sorry but that’s how it is in high school and middle school! There is more than a pregnant risk, one is how you look at your self also a STD risk|`|c2485398ad26998f5a6a50939d5980b0aa	No! sweetie just wait!!!!!!!! When u get older it's way better around 30.<br>  Right now ure not ready to make him happy in bed.|`|PcI3D0EAaa	Let me be honest with you. The fact that youre on here asking means youre questioning it yourself.. And that is a NO. if your gut is telling you no, which it must be because youre asking advice.. do not do it. <br>  Virginity is something far too many girls give away ans end up regretting. <br>  It is your decision, and yours alone, but make sure if you want to do it.. its for the right reasons.. not to please some guy, or becasue "everyone else is doing it", because let me tell you something.. everyone else IS NOT doing it// ppl talk to sound cool.. and this guy will more than likely not be around in the future. <br>  MAke sure youre 100 percent ready.. and know all that you could be risking..<br>  Pregnancy is a possibilty.. are you on Birth control? If not.. DONT DO IT.. condoms break.. and at your age, the childbirth would be sooooo extrmemly painful. I doubt the guy would stay around.. And I doubt it would even feel good for you.. but it will hurt.. and you may bleed. <br>  You are VERY young.. you have soo much time...soo many special ppl to meet.. and places to go.. if you were to get pregnant, thats a lifelong thing.. your childhood/adolescence will be over.. amd you will become a mom.. most liekly a single mother.. I did it, dont get me worng i was not as young as you but it was still hard.. a lot of hard work.. and im sure u still live at home.. and seeing how u mentioned your mom, and no dad im assuming she is a single parent? See? Not only will you be repeating the past ,and your mom will be hertbroken, but you will be making your mom responsible, becausetrust me honey, at 14 you cannot support a baby on your own.. so it will most lieky be your mother and welfare supporting the baby...no fun.. u know? you have YEARS for sex.. wait. Have fun. live your teenage years to the fullest.. trust me cuz once youre an adult and have responsibilities you;ll wish you would have been a kid for longer..<br>  Good Luck hun..<br>  :)|`|e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	no you shouldn't save your virginity for your husband are you will regret it.|`|gKJkbn6laa	if you cannot spell fourteen you cannot have sex<br>  <br>  seriously tho, if you have to ask yahoo answers, then you arent sure, and you will definitely regret it after. its not something you should kinda want to do. its something you should be 100% certain about|`|Hk39AkNGaa	Please, DON'T Its teh biggest.

b5775798730f400832e9b79b79ec090eaa	Fly away birdie.  I found from high school, I only had 3 good friends.  I speak with them all still now, but we aren't any where near close now.  One lives minutes away, the other 2 hours away, and the most important one, she lives in a whole nother country.  My point is, if they are important to you, keep them in your life.  But if you could give or take, then give.  You don't want to be exposed to crap, then don't be exposed, it's all up to you.  You can make new friends, better ones, if you look in the right places.  It's never too late to make some good friends.  Just choose carefully, and then hold on tight.  But you have to make an effort.  Try church, school, library...etc.  Don't try bars, clubs, parties...etc.  I think you get my point.  If you want some wholesome, fun, special friends, you won't find them at certain places.    Fly away!|`|45dac1b6e7d216fd1125e8c855f4b41faa	i think you should make new friends     ======================================...

Just dont let it get dramatic or negative, because it weighs u down. Be real be honest and open with them and urself. Look for new friends, there is no such thing as too many friends but keep those that accentuate ur positve the closest. God Bless and Good Luck|`|5e44231e228e78c06fabe443e17e9064aa	It sounds to me like you really need to make some new friends. Start looking around at school and in your town for different things to get involved in to meet new people. If you continue to hang out with people that don't improve your life, it will becoming emotionally draining. I was friends with a girl for a long time, even the godmother to her daughter. I was in the delivery room when this chid was born but I could no longer be friends with the mom. She was just so negative and draining and toxic. I will say that I am not proud of the way I handled it but at the same time, putting an end to our relationship was the best thing I could have done for myself. Good luck!
0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	It could mean something or it could be nothing.  Do you spend a lot of time together or do you rely heavily on txt messages to communicate?  How soon after her break-up with the other guy did you guys get together?  Why did she break up with him?  Is she going through a busy time with work/studies?  Were you good friends before you started going out?  These are all things that could have an influence.    You sound a bit insecure.  Get over it as soon as possible.  If you're telling her how you feel in great detail often, hoping that she'll respond in kind, she might feel like the relationship is moving too fast, but because she doesn't want to hurt you she tries to slow things down this way.  Try focusing on the friendship you share, doing fun things together, talking about things other than your relationship, how you feel and how she feels.  Let her know that it's okay for her to take her time deciding where she wants the relationship to go and make an agreement that either of you can tell the other person honestly if the relationship is not working for them.  Just remember that if she wants to slow down the relationship, it doesn't mean she wants to break up with you.  It's more likely that she likes and respects you, and values your friendship enough to rather go slow and be sure, than rush along and break your heart.  Girls really don't like hurting guys, so they find it really hard when a guy makes them feel like they don't have the right to choose anymore - she HAS to be head-over-heels-all-over-him in love or else it's going to break his heart.    So give her some space and focus on building the friendship between you, not the relationship.  A strong relationship builds naturally on a strong friendship.  But you can't build the house without the foundation.    Good luck!|`|d4ca144084817ca61f78297921faf3c7aa	guess you can limit u saying nice things to her(at ur own risk)and check her reaction.women think differently from men.when you try to be a "nice guy" they may intepret it different.so let her know ur a strong personality|`|d6c1c9b41cdd7f1278ae2d338064377daa	i don't know? i guess it all depend on what nice things you are saying.if you are telling this girl that you love her, maybe you are moving to fast. speaking from a girls point of view, yes it nice when guys say nice things to you, but it can also get annoying if they do it to much. so, maybe that what your doing.try talking to her or txt. her about other things other than saying nice things all of the time.try telling her about your day, or what your doing tomorrow.|`|3add3b8b87e3da83233006637f392cf5aa	she might be re-thinking everything, catching her breath, and just having a good think on what's going on in life, I't probably better to see in real life rather than just txt her.|`|25a4acf4f5353e7d32c54125bfb67678aa	well it is really hard to tell somones mood through text messages, just keep that in mind.  Also she could sick of texting, or she might not know what to say.  Don't jump to conclusions, because there could be a perfectly good reason why she is being short with you.  Take into consideration where and who she is with when she texts you, if all her friends are around and want to read what she is saying, then she might not want to say anything personal, or if she is in class she might not have time to say much.  Just talk to her about it|`|AA11477276	It might mean nothing at all.. what if she is with someone else at the time ur texting her.. and so as not to arise any suspicions.. she is doing it.

AA11775522	We always want what we can't have.  She probably genuinely liked you, but now that you're interested is probably resentful for not being your first choice.  Do you like her as much as you liked Mary or is she just conveniently there?  If not, she will sense it, so don't waste your time or hers...It's not good to date co-workers unless you really think it's worth the risk of one of you having to move on if it doesn't work out.  If you think it's worth it, then you've got a lot of grovelling and romancing to do.  Good luck!|`|75bba54f3699b466383de10c70f417c1aa	you should porbly go out with what girl you feel more confortable around and what ever u have the srtongest feelings tword|`|d7d553a2793031c2f2cadd243a3b54f7aa	You'd be a fool not to.What have you got to lose?Get her a gift for her birthday and see how she reacts ....if she blushes even slightly ask her out then and there she'll be putty in your hands.Good luck.|`|a823aeeca9298c3ef616e20a24173ea2aa	You should definately tell her how you feel.

He also probably likes partying a lot and drinking.  Doesn't seem to me like the sorta guy who would want a relationship.|`|c70d2f21cf0f901121087862338ce262aa	It sounds as though your friend wants the best of both worlds.  He wants to keep you on the leash so that he won't be left alone.  Does he have someone else in his life or is he looking for someone else and is keeping the lines of communications open with you so as not to be left alone and wanting.  Secondly could be he just wants a sex friend and yet not a real girl friend.  Either way be very careful and don't get yourself into something you will regret.  He says he just wants to be friends so leave it at that.  Let him come to you and if you are not ready for him then back off but if you are then take it slowly you do not want to get hurt.  Remember to get all the facts before you make a decision.  Best of Luck to you.|`|7fbbfb960cf4f89ee7f90a54d1497ec3aa	i think that u shold take it slow and sooner or later he will relize ur everything to him. and he will come to u! in the mean time just have fun and flirt with him to show him that u care about him. he will come to u dont go to him|`|49ff08b78887e128ac368bc1f959f172aa	This is a tough one! It reminds me of a very similar situation I was in with a friend on mine.    Having alcohol involved on all occaisions clouds the issue here.  On the one hand it lowers inhibitions so you are both more likely to say things you wouldn't normally admit to.  On the other hand it can give you a good dose of the warm fuzzies and amplify feelings that aren't strong enough in the cold light of day to act on.    My advice would be to bring this up when you are both stone cold sober.  If he says again that he doesn't think you should do anything nomatter your feelings ask him why not?  If he is afraid that you might loose your friendship then this comment could mean that he is just afraid of loosing you.  If he won't give you a straight answer then I would say its a brush off.    I hope it works out for you!  Good luck :o)

It's simple, just get one of your friends (a girl) and kiss her and stuff (it doesn't have to amount to literal lesbian sex). Then either do and threesome or watch your boyfriend and your friend do it and watch for a while, then you pull her away for a while and make it just a little hotter, and do a threesome or let her have her own party somewhere else. And then there is option two, make an erotic home video with a girl, show it to him and pop out of the closet or the bedroom and say that you're not done yet, and he has a chance for a man-lady-lady threesome, or make it with him in the first place.|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	try a wallet with a cute pic of u guys inside

Try getting to know someone before asking them out, it really helps and it worked for me on countless occasions.  Try not to be nervous when you talk to women ( I know, its a tough one) and be yourself.  There is someone out there for you, you just have to find her.  Also, I'm not sure how you dress, but stores like American Eagle and Express for Men are great places to get some nice clothes....it does make a difference and it will help you build your confidence when you realize that you do look better......thats what happened to me.    And one last thing....Don't take rejection personally, think of it as her loss!  Good luck Bro|`|0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	Make a list of your good qualities, what you have to offer in a relationship.  Then look at your bad qualities and change what you don't like about yourself.  Determine your own values and get a clear picture of the kind of person you want to be with.  Then get out there and start meeting people (without thinking relationship from the start) and making friends.  Concentrate on being the right person, instead of finding the right person.  The rest will take care of itself.  And be willing to take some risks!  Nothing in life worth having, comes without a risk.

Give him a call and tell him you've been thinking about him and decided to call and see what's up and to wish him a Happy Holiday.  Make the conversation "easy, breezy".  Ask if he's seeing anyone special and if yes, take your  cue from there and keep the conversation light . If you find out he's not seeing anyone tell him you'd love to find the time before the holidays (this will make you sound "not desperate") to meet and buy him a holiday drink or coffee.

I know that sounds harsh, but it's just the way life works.  You alone are responsible for what you think, which influences what you feel and do.  Find yourself a hobby or something that could occupy your thoughts and whenever a thought of this guy pops into your head, refuse to build on it and focus on the hobby or something else.  It'll take time, but you'll get over him.  And don't compare every other guy you meet to him, allow yourself to get to know other guys and even to fall in love with someone else.

You both still have your entire lives ahead of you.    Is a relationship actually going to last long enough for you to marry each other?  What is the point of dating if you aren't going to marry that person?      And a person's mind isn't done growing until they are 25.  So you may not like him for the rest of your life.    So I'd say just be friends.

The lips are just slightly touching.  You do not tense them and she must not too.  All you do is slightly touch her lips with yours and look deep in her eyes.  (do not smile lol)    French kisses are usually unappropiate in public.  It gets on everyones nerves.  The only time I french kiss my wife is when I'm about to go all the way!  It looks childish to french-kiss on the tops of buses and places where teens hang out.  I think It would look cool if you act as if all this kissing was not new to you.  So to do that, don't do it in public.    The best kiss is to do what you want to do with your lips.  There are no rules!!!  Well, there is one - make sure you don't suck her tongue.      Good luck!|`|595a1e3f5fc3ad870c51e08895be4f15aa	with pop rocks|`|683b20f10c4b3c8b88239d788d757f19aa	Take her face..cup it in your hands and kiss her lower lip..she will tremble trust me lol :)|`|4a3a6d466920fd15998413ca9e02a69daa	puppy pecking is always nice. repetetively, depending on how you do it, either goes cute or creepy.  i think the most intimate way is kissing on neck, and/or ears.

He will just see it as nagging and leave you anyways.  If he does change, it's only temporary, and he will eventually resent you for changing him.  He will then change back to the way he was and dump your a*ss for trying to change him.

No doubt it would be a great boon for you - but it may take a long time to come to shape, if at all it comes.  Don't think amiss of me.  Tell him you shall not have sex with him if he smoke at home - tell him coaxingly. At least this will reduce his smoking to some extent.    Wish u best of luck.  God bless you.

Ofcourse Rome wazn't built in a day, so be patient & take things one step at a time.Buy him medical gum for smokers, u can find lots of those at any pharmacy, get the one suitible for ur bf's smoking habbit, 2-5mg. or more.Try being with him most of the time for the first few weeks, help him "minimize" his daily ciggerettes & n'after that, switch to a liter brand. You must know these thingz take time but are not impossible, so don't lose faith, cz one day HE WILL want to quit but won't know how. TRUST ME. Also, u really have to convince him it's an ugly habbit that will hurt him & does no good.he should want to quit before anything happens, so try talking to him, n'take it one day at a time & good luck!|`|de5926afee215d6ac06a65320b0cca1baa	If you badger him to quit he wont.

Best thing for him just have a glass of water when he wants to smoke infornt of you. The best way to ease the habit of smoking have a glass of water whenever you feel to smoke.    I was a chain smoker ..probably had 20 cigs. a day.. now I reduce that to 3 cigs/day.. within a month I will stop smoking ..|`|AA11125735	You can tell him that if you still smoking and gets cancer, I will leave you and make a new boyfriend.|`|2b1b9c3d8ee8ba7cd160f84d43594826aa	Here is the thing about dealing with guys (and smokers); it has to be their idea.  Even if it's your idea, it has to seem like there idea.  The more you push, the more they will resist.  You can simply "plant the seed" but it has to germinate in their minds.  First of all, the supportive whenever he brings up the subject of stop smoking.  You can initiate the conversation with something like "I hear there is a new medicine (Chantix)", or "I hear there's a new shot (SMART Shot) that has been really helpful in helping people quit smoking.)  Then leave it alone.  In a few weeks for a few months he will come back to you and say "what was the name of that medicine again ?  "  The point being, he will only quit when he is ready to quit.  It is the old "you can lead a horse to water..."          Sincerely,    Kirk G.

Keep your private life private and share only with him. I don't read anywhere that you have discussed this with him. <br>  You have endured being eroded for four years. What's keeping you there?  If you won't talk to him or get counseling, what do you hope will happen?  <br>  It's a marriage between the two of you. I think you violate it by talking about him on line and letting people believe he is always the bad guy, when he can't even answer for himself. If you want to keep this marriage, work with him.

My opinion from personal experience is that he was really pissed about something. Did you two have a bad fight about something before this? All he is trying to do is hurt your feelings. My hubby did this lastnight and, the night before that. I have gone through so much BS it's pathetic. Well, long story short, he took his ring off, said he was tired of looking at it, then he told me he has been talking to another woman online and, is falling in-love with her, and he told me if I didn't leave right now, that he was going to beat in my face. So, I got my keys/purse and, walked out the door. He came outside and, started screaming and crying telling me how sorry he is and, that he only said those things to hurt me. He has told me he isn't in-love anymore, and that he hates me. So, he pushes my buttons when things don't go his way. And, your hubby is doing the SAME thing. Either you love your hubby enough to deal with it, or you just can't deal with it. Some men, vent their anger by bringing you down to their level. I have dealt with it on and off for almost 9 years. So, either get use to it, or find someone else. Good Luck, I hope I helped.|`|vk6sczbLaa	Is he ever willing to calm down and talk things out to solve the problems you guys have?<br>  <br>  If not, stop playing his games. Marriage and love is not something to make idle threats over. If he doesn't love you anymore, and is constantly angry, I don't think there's even enough counseling that he would be willing to go through to help make your marriage work.<br>  <br>  Is there a bag that you can pack and a family member or friend that you can stay with? When he gets home, tell him that you're not playing his games anymore, and you're not going to take his abuse anymore. Have a few friends with you if you do this! Leave the house with everything you need -- even his ring because he "gave it back," meaning it's no longer his possession -- and start filing for divorce.<br>  <br>  I really hate divorce, but you have to get out of this abusive relationship. And you need to respect yourself enough to know that either he needs to shape up and start being a good husband, or you need to leave.|`|P3YUwjKmaa	Sounds like he is testing you for something. Not sure what it is but when people tell you about things like that before they do them they are usually soliciting come kind of response. I am sorry, sounds like it really sucks. A lot of the time people who feel like things ares out of their control will use their emotions to try and control other people. In other words, hoping that his anger will solicit some kind of a response from you. People who test others in such ways are usually deeply afraid of being abandoned, foster kids do it to new parents all of the time. <br>  <br>    One thing I can say is you may want to try putting the ring somewhere that he can get to it but don't try and get him to take it back. Maybe out in the open on the table. I say this because the ring itself is part of the game: "Here, I'll give you this back and see if you try and get me to take it back again." The only way to 'win' a game like that is to refuse to play. The issue has nothing to do with the ring, also decide what level of emotional abuse you are going to tolerate and know when to draw boundaries or even walk away until he chooses to respect you. Sorry that I can't be more specific but hope that gives you some ideas. Best Wishes.           -Leaky
YAPEpa5baa	As everyone has stated, the law varies state to state - but you should be able to find the NYS court website online via a google search and that will give you an idea of what the laws are in NY.  There's also other reasons why a minor child can stop visitation with a parent, which can be done with an emergency hearing showing good cause, or because a parent is in contempt of court on some grounds, or because the parent screwed up and lost that right.<br>  <br>  Where I live, the law is 13 - but there are other grounds to cause a parent to lose parental rights in a shared custody, or shared parental right situation.  Thus is the case with my minor child, who no longer wishes contact with her father, and the father has now lost all his parental rights.  That does not stop him from being required to pay child support though.  Child support/visitation/parental rights are all separate issues.  These are all things that should be covered in a settlement and/or parenting agreement.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No minor should ever be forced to see a parent against their will, whatever the reason is, they should be able to have their rights acknowledged.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	This is in response to MZ:<br>  <br>  Child support is not "payment" for access to your child.  Visitation rights are NOT linked to child support.  If a child does not wish to spend time with the non-custodial parent, child support is still payable.<br>  <br>  Please do not spread your ignorance of family law around.|`|sLLgERQWaa	In NY state the age is 17....according to the lawyer that I had. Children are entitled to child support until age 21 unless they emancipate themselves thru marriage or military, or leaving the home. If they return, however, child support can resume until age 21.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Courts determine that a child has more control whether or not they want to see a parent around the age of 14 and up..check with the courts..consult a lawyer|`|jJwuMTSqaa	That would depend on your state, and you need to ask a professional.|`|dVlLahozaa	parents have visiting rights if they pay for child support.|`|CIyuis2haa	This is not so easy to answer because each state has different laws on the books related to custody, visitation, etc.... What I normally find is that the child can refuse to follow the court order, they're really not a party to the action. However, usually the parent losing time with the child will blame the other parent for "making" the child not want to visit. If that can be proven, it could be grounds for a change in custody. Since laws are different, you really need to talk to an attorney in your state, but generally, I see no judge is going to force an 18 year old child to visit. You can always walk away or drive away at any time if you wanted to.|`|eca5081cf1a52165be5f0e9110f9d187aa	Others here are correct in stating that it depends on where you live.  Depending on state, county and more, it can vary greatly what kind of "good ol' boys club" you get in terms of judges.<br>  <br>  Some courts are considerably more intelligent than others.  For example, here in Tulare County, California.  I probably won't get to see my children much ever again despite what they want.  They have been saying all along they want me back, but the judges in my case couldn't care less and do not even acknowledge the topic.  This type of thing apparently differs in other areas.<br>  <br>  So if you're in the "backwoods" like I am (that's what the lawyers in my area call my area) then you might as well forget it.  Hopefully you are in a better area.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	depends on what state you live in, in certain states at the age of 13 they can have a say in who they want to live with, but that doesn't necessarily mean the judge will listen. my kids didn't want to, but they had to go anyways. now they are all old enough to go when they want...and they don't want to.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	My parents divorced when I was 15.

8Zk3t6yAaa	You said you like this guy alot so why are you worried about travis and jeff? I mean if you really like him you cant be texting exes...thats wrong...so now its between current guy and one you love...which one is more important...i would give new guy a chance because lover boy already had a chance and it didnt work out...hes prob just jealous right now because he doesnt wanna see you sith someone else...if you go running back to him you will probably just break up again...he just wants you so no one else can have you...most likely not because he loves you for real.
kfWi9ZkEaa	Whoops a daisy.  If you resolve an event in your life, you don't have to tell the next boyfriend about it.  It's a common mistake but a destructive one.  He didn't see you as honest, which is what you thought he would do; he saw you as cheating, and the picture is attached to his eyeballs.<br>  <br>  I would leave it where it sits.  I think you've blown it in a fairly final way, and you don't want to spend a year dragging this thing to pieces while your boyfriend suffers insecurity and accusations, and you lose all faith in him.  In short, you blew it.  <br>  <br>  Editing:  this guy is a dork, by the way.  <br>  <br>  having said that: if I wanted chocolate and someone said 'no' I'd still go for the chocolate.  Who says they can tell me what to do?  And who says they're right anyway?<br>  <br>  Do as you please.  I wouldn't worry about the outcomes though:  just go for the best option in life and ignore the fears.|`|cDqz71QKaa	you should have taken things slowly instead of coming right out with it<br>  just let the convo work up to it|`|828ac86c4aed6b8aab5980e0aa7d0831aa	To be perfectly honest, you got what you deserved. Maybe it was a while ago and maybe he judged you a bit unfairly. But the fact of the matter is that you cheated. He is probably incredibly hurt and just didn't know what to do. You've told him the truth and apologized (I assume)...just see how things go. And if they don't work out, well you've learned your lesson. <br>  Side note: If you wait until you're married to have sex...you won't have these problems!!|`|pIkJVfAkaa	Hmmm... it is a tough one.  Honestly sincerely what would you do if you were in his shoes?  If you truly believe it is unfair at that point then enough's enough.  Trust is HUGE and when it is broken it sometimes may never be restored.  You may spend the rest of your dating life with him trying to "prove" you're trust, but he may never believe it because any little thing you do even if non-intentional could be seen as cheating.|`|tmduRTpBaa	try to tell ur man how that is not u anymore and u love him so much u would never ever cheat on him. and take him out for a nice dinner and apologize and again tell him u would never do that and u love him. that should help! : ^ )|`|G9831g5Baa	Some things need to be skeletons in the closet, until they come up in conversation.

Just explain to him that cheating and being unfaithful is in your past and you really have changer, that you wouldn't think of hurting him because you care about him. He should understand if he cheated before too, and if he doesn't that's not fair to you, and i would say move on you deserve better, but you never know until you try.<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out!|`|rnoUnR6qaa	Hey sweetie!

You know, having that young man in your life again, will not make you any good in your future anyways. Focus on your needs at this point, and if he comes back, hey! that's great, just do not worry, if he does not care, with your persistence it will not even work anymore, some guys can be a definite hard-headed like one of my ex's no matter how much I tried, he will not be like changing his mind with his confusions. :) okay? <333 ! I hope things work out for you!
voTyeJexaa	my best friend has this problem all the time.<br>  <br>  date both of them!<br>  and no, that doesnt mean be bf/gf with both, thats cheating.<br>  the adult concept of dating<br>  hang out with each on their own. go on a few dates, hang out, just chill with each and see which one you connect with better, then you can make a choice. and no, unlike the vast teenage realm of today thinks; this does not make you a slut, or a whore because youre seeing two people. it means you are smart enough to have control over yourself and have enough confidence to see who works better with you.<br>  hope i helped
zLzwaCpcaa	Well, you are on the right track. You need to talk to her because if you don't you will regret not doing so. Since you are in school, It's easiest to stick to that topic.

Just go up and say hi.. girls appreciate guys who can put themselves on the line for embarrassment. :)|`|RSP5djNbaa	if you have a class with her, ask her what the homework is. strike up an easier conversation, like what time is it, do you have a pen, something along those lines that will lead to more depth and better converstaions|`|cDqz71QKaa	just start with a smile<br>  and head bob<br>  than work to hi<br>  and stuff|`|tAPR9qPpaa	First, get an excuse to talk to her, (if she is in any of your classes, ask her for the homework,) Once she gives it to her, then you can start talking.

(even if you know if she is or not, just ask) and then say, "Oh, so...want to go out with me?"|`|22NgAhCCaa	NEVER just go straight up to her.<br>  Better way is to just make friends with someone she always hangs out with that way it will seem like your just trying to hang out with the other girl.....then when you all are just hanging out try to make jokes and make 'her' laugh..... Later on when the relationship advances hang out with her more then when you know you 2 are like best friends ask her out.....|`|PcI3D0EAaa	It is true thats if she doesnt know who you are, she may be wierded out if you approach her. You should get to know her first, amd become her friend\.. esp if youre in High school.. people tend to react of there peers at that age. esp females. So it takes strategy.. you dont want to wierd her out.. then word will spread and ruin your chances and your rep. Avoid being creepy and just get to know her.. appraoch her about something simple.. esp if u share classes, ask about an assignment.. or if she has something cool on her shirt.. anythihg... just get her  to notice you..<br>  That age is hard.. people tend to care more about the opinions of others rather than there own.. it'd be good to get in with her friends.. <br>  there opinion will matter.. trust me.<br>  good luck!|`|qf0kuMCiaa	Start by saying hi, So do you like movies? and when she say's umm yes, ask her so what new movies have you seen?

A ton of talking happens through the eyes. <br>  <br>  Try and not be nervous...be comfortable...be yourself...say hay ever once in a while and maybe ask her for what the homework, or a pencil. Start of slow...don't come on to hard/fast...girls do not like that and if they do...its not gonna last very long anyways. <br>  <br>  Always keep in mind that if love is meant to be it will be. That doesn't mean that you can't try and help it out a little bit...oh another thing....ASK HER TO PROM!!! and include her in the planning...it causes things to become less awkward and at least yall will become friends.

6OldQQCOaa	It's through your actions, not your words.<br>  When you say "I love you," our first thought is "Why?"<br>  It's just a natural thing we girls want to know. <br>  Love is not a feeling, or an emotion, love is choosing the highest good for the other person. <br>  <br>  If she gets five of her best girls, and asks them to forget everything and anything you have ever said to her, and any of the conversations you two have had, and ask them to only judge on your actions, do they think you have treated her with respect and love? Do they think your actions are true? Their answer will give her a good understanding.<br>  <br>  Some other advice:<br>  Give her a single red rose. Most girls would appreciate this rather than a dozen red roses. This is because girls (mostly) focus on the detail, rather than the picture as a whole. One red rose symbolizes the bond of your relationship - the two of you coming together as one. It's romantic and thoughtful.|`|vk6sczbLaa	Actions speak louder than words. You can tell her you love her all you want, but unless you do something to back up your statement, she's not really going to believe it.<br>  <br>  The action that needs to happen will be different from girl to girl. If you truly love her, then it's assumed that you know a lot about her. She may expect you to know her interests, likes, dislikes, favorite things, etc... if you love her enough to really pay attention to her.<br>  <br>  It's always a very nice surprise to find out that a guy is really paying attention and listening to what a girl has to say. So if you randomly give her a small bouquet of her favorite flower, or treat her to a restaurant she's been dying to go to... stuff like that... it'll show her that you care enough about her to pay attention to her.|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	she is insecure. she doesn't believe that you love her. just keep showing her and telling her. <br>  <br>  i know that a guy loves me when he brushes hair out of my face and kisses me on my forehead and cares for me.|`|N361k5Hsaa	wen u treat girls like theyre ur only special person|`|828ac86c4aed6b8aab5980e0aa7d0831aa	Well, first off the way they say 'i love you'... sometimes you can tell if they are just saying it or if they really do.<br>  And the way they look at you... sometimes they'll look at you as if you're just another girl but sometimes you can just see it in their eyes that they love you.<br>  Just tell her how you feel using more than just the words 'i love you' :)|`|XZEaQ4Myaa	Well, first off the way they say 'i love you'... sometimes you can tell if they are just saying it or if they really do.<br>  And the way they look at you... sometimes they'll look at you as if you're just another girl but sometimes you can just see it in their eyes that they love you.<br>  Just tell her how you feel using more than just the words 'i love you' :)|`|m2eHPeciaa	how do i know a guy loves me? its his actions that show me he does. i've had BF's that told me all the time, and it usually means nothing to me... actions are louder than words.|`|pdASSjn8aa	on how she has been treated by you and by your actions, girls know that what a guy says doesnt mean as much as do his actions.|`|sq9bls5Yaa	maybe the way u said ... <br>  say it like u mean it //<br>  can u answer my question ?: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225151811AAFg52m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lBNXznCeaa	Your actions will always tell more than your words.

Thats how we kno|`|2oN7WrVKaa	I think girls who have been hurt before, or who have an extremely low self-esteem are very hard on themselves.<br>  They dont really see how anyone can love them.<br>  If you really want her to believe you, hold her, look directly in her eyes, and put as much passion into it as you can.<br>  If she doesnt see it, then obviously she isnt ready, and its not going to work out..<br>  She needs to love herself, before loving another.<br>  Good luck.
HnEcgVGiaa	Dude, I don't think a relationship should be your primary focus right now. Your focus should be on your school, your future career, and mending the relationships that you already have with other people, such as your family and 'friends'.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about relationships. I'm 23, virgin, and never had a girlfriend. So you're not alone; there are many single guys out there at your age that are pretty much in the same situation.<br>  <br>  I like your ability to not be drawn into peer pressure to engage in drugs and negative aspects of society. You have good moral values; you just need to find new group of friends! You aren't a failure; I've failed enough exams in school, but I'm still alive and kicking. I do poorly on exams, but excellent in projects. Perhaps you are like that as well. Textbook learning won't provide everything you need to know on how to survive life.<br>  <br>  Don't just consider your 'failures' to be failures, but opportunities and experiences that will make you tougher and wiser. You need to have more confidence and hope. Your life can change dramatically in a matter of days, hours, or even minutes, so don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  I'll be back with more response. I have to leave for a while.<br>  <br>  - Brian<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You say your 'friends' treat you like dirt. I don't think you can really consider them as your true friends. They are merely your way of satisfying your hunger for some social events in your life. True friends support each other and have great time. You need to find a new group of people to hang around with. You might be able to hold off their bad influences, but it kills your morale.<br>  <br>  If you plan on attending college, you can dramatically change your life. Choose wherever you want to go and pursue your dreams. You can open a whole new window of opportunities and hopes. Meet new people and inspire new career paths.<br>  <br>  Finding a job in this economy is tough for everyone. And it's great that you're still standing. Keep on fighting. It will make you tougher, making you be able to withstand challenges and obstacles.<br>  <br>  You're a great guy, and you will be rewarded for your good deeds and patience. Remain patient and keep on battling your way through. You can break free.<br>  <br>  - Brian|`|fj5nfuZTaa	Well, I concider myself a kind guy. Never smoked or used drugs. I do drink occasionaly with my good friends, but I started only when I was 18, plus anyway I do not do it very often. I am in my late 30s now. Looking back I am not sorry for being who I am. At your age I never yet had a girlfriend. Here is how it worked for me: I am happily married with one son. My family is my strong foundation. It is hard to understand at your age, but everything is yet ahead of you. Don't rush and be yourself. If you ever will try to be someone else you will only be second best. You will find your solemate. Don't lose your hope|`|he3O1RFUaa	Have confidence and you'll get a girlfriend more easily. TRUST ME!

FWPSzFVhaa	Joe,  you sound like you have a heart of gold.  If she can not see that - it is her loss and not yours.  But still, love has a mind of its own.  That I get. <br>  <br>  So what to do?  Write her a letter and tell her exactly how you feel.  Tell her what you think.  If she doesn't respond to that - then it is better to know now.
IqoRBVUTaa	I am so sorry. I know how it feels to be unheard. My mom has cancer and dad left us. Its awful to not know what to tell them. I have two younger siblings also, and last year when my mothers cancer was worst, my little sister, 4 years also, asked me if "Mommy was going to die." The worst part is, no one knew if she was going to make it or not. It's a terrible feeling. The best thing to do is to have there parents explain it them selves. Sit down with them and make them listen to what you have to say. I don't mean to criticize, but your parents sound very immature to leave there four year old children. And I know this probably isn't the best time to ask, but what is it like to have a twin?<br>  Good luck.<br>  -Ali|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	there is not one reason that you can not tell them the truth.  mom and dad are at the bar and they will be home later.  end of speech.  you do not have to go into detail, that will surely come later!!!|`|lGdzb8aqaa	tell your grandparents or other family what is going on.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Best thing you can do is to call child protective services and get them involved.  sounds as if both your parents need a wakeup call that can only be given by the child protective services people.  <br>  <br>  They will more than likely charge your parents with child neglect but after counseling for their drugs and alcohol abuse they will be much better parents.<br>  <br>  Trouble is you and your brother and sister may have to live in foster care or with other family members while your parents are being dealt with by the cops and the child protective services people and the courts.|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Talk to your school counselor!

I somehow feel like I relate to you, cause I'm 14 and have a twin too, although shes a girl :) Anyway, I'm sorry that you dont have the best parents in the world. It sucks that you and your bro have to be 'Mom and Dad' for your little sisters. I would just keep telling them that mommy & daddy are very busy with work and other business, because their 4 and I think you can keep feeding them that line for a while. In a few years or so their going to realize whats really going on, just like you did. And even though you want to, its impossible to shield them from the truth. I think if you have any other family members who you trust, maybe tell them whats going on and see if they can help in anyway. I know its kinda hard to open up to grownups, but they really are willing to help in more cases. And if your sisters keep nagging, tell them "Why does it matter? You have me and your brother! Now lets have some fun" and play a game or something. Stay strong girl, I really hope everything works out & your a great sister, I can tell, Stay strong :)<br>  <br>  Love Sienna<3|`|6qsocyK3aa	Tell the police, social services, another family member, just tell someone. That is not right. You're still kids and you don't deserve to give up your childhood just yet.|`|OyOQES3paa	ok tell them that mommy and daddy are out running errands or that they are working later so that they can buy them more toys. but i really think that your best bet is calling cps or telling you relatives cuz you really dont want your siblings or yourselves to be growing up with drug addicts and alcoholics in the house and you might know better than to do what they are doing but your sisters probably wont because they knew nothing better than the life they currently live
NYcODdP4aa	um..u can ask him if hes made at u and if he says yes then apologize<br>  or you could have someone ask him for you.<br>  <br>  but i understand whats going on that happend to me and my old friend but were friends again but not tight like we used to be

That will just teach him that when you don't know what else to do, resort to violence. Maybe you could simply sit him down and talk to him. Ask him  why he does what he does. Maybe he just needs some love and attention. After all, he lost his father,but also went through a divorce, and a new mother, now his mom is sick too. Seems like alot for a young man to interpret. How bout helping instead of criticizing. Let him vent, or set him up with a counselor who specializes in Childhood trauma.|`|eDRk230Uaa	well the good thing to do is like pretend telling him that you are going to put him in the foster famioly then he wont bother or than taker him and you know but not for real so hwe will stop good luck and god bless your mother hope she is better hipoeyou give 10 points to me|`|izznp1uiaa	there may be a really good reason why he is acting like this, that you or your family does not know. <br>  i think you just need to sit down with him, just you two, and just ask how his day went, if he had homework, or what classes he's talking. <br>  just start small talk. <br>  tell him whats going on in your life, maybe who your dating, whose been texting you, you know? <br>  and if he doesn't open up, or he is rude, try the same thing day after day. <br>  <br>  i really hope this works, <br>  <br>  because i think the best thing to do is start a relationship with him, a real one. <br>  <br>  tel me how it goes, please: amberdouglas12@yahoo.com|`|dcd11iUwaa	you need to sit him down and tell he needs to step up.<br>  tell him hes the man of the house now and its his responsibility to watch over the women in his life.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	Place him in an "alternative school" like a boot camp or kick him out of the house.|`|mM5FwiTEaa	try talking to your brother and explaining to him how fragile your mother is.

If you find him the right therapist to talk to, he can unload his pain, and get some guidance on how to deal with his issues. If he is still in school, a guidance counselor might help. There are many kinds of therapies, and even if they don't always seem to work, it gives him a chance to talk to someone who might be able to help outside of your home<br>  It sounds like he has some anger built up in him.Offer him your friendship, care and time. It might be a long shot, but at least you will open a door for him.

Let her know exactly how you feel, don't hold back. If you really, really like her it is not good to hold back.

If you have real feelings then its important not to rush things and most importantly be yourself no matter what.

Alot of people experience this in one form or another in life. This is what life is all about. Birth and death. It's what's in between that matters. You always have your memories of her, and these thoughts will give you strength. Talking it out with other family members will offer you some relief - it's comforting to surround yourself with family that feel what you feel.

If you were very close to your Grandma it will take a lot of time to heal and feel better.  Time to adjust is very important.  It doesn't happen easily.  Just allow yourself time to work through all the stages of grief and while your going through it try and   help others with what you learn.  Best wishes and I am sorry for your loss.|`|31884f9c2e86bec151666e25aceccf74aa	My dear I know it is extremely hard but just remember that each of us has our own life, the most important thing is to move on and be make your life worthy of living.

If you know things specifically that he enjoys, invite him to something he enjoys that you also enjoy.  Also be yourself and you should be fine.    Also, I must mention, that there is no such thing as typical actor good looks, cause we come in all shapes, sizes, and looks.|`|GPFnaKXcaa	Other people think that you're out of his league, yet, you say that he should have somehow guessed that you, a co-worker, pretended anything more than saying hi, when you myspaced him with a hi. Really, I can't understand how the human race hasn't extinguished itself yet.  I mean, c'mon, you yourself have said that he's kinda shy, so why would you expect him to just pop up and ask you out after you message him once? In a totally safe and non-commited way, I might add?  I mean, really, if you just think he's a jerk-off, ditch him, but don't try to blame it on the guy for not reading your mind...
01976950d59b2ca14689e03a8f35f5afaa	I'm currently studying child development and I am learning that children don't purposefully do things that are bad.  So to punish a kid because they've done something that is wrong but they don't understand how it is wrong...is incorrect punishment.    It's not until about the age of 8 years that children begin to develop moral values.  Where they actually govern their own actions without the help of a parent.    I think parents have a great responsibility in teaching children how to behave correctly by addressing to them in a way that children can understand.  I was spanked as a child and I understood I was spanked when my mom said no and I wanted to do what she told me not to.  But you can't spank a kid for taking a toy that they like from a store shelf and not giving it back to you...how do you explain to a kid that they can't have that toy because you don't want to buy it because it's a lot of money and it's not theirs?  It's so far above their level of understanding, and they yell because they don't know how to explain that they REALLY WANT THIS TOY AND THEY REALLY LIKE IT TO PLAY WITH ALL THE TIME.  It takes a lot of effort to talk to children, but it can be done and children can communicate, they can yell when they really want something (which is when we spank to shut them up) but if they're told they need to use their speaking voice because mom can't understand...they'll talk, because if you understand, they'll get what they want.      It's better to act as a guide rather than as a  disciplinarian, and know how to talk to your children so that they can understand how to behave with their parents, with peers, with family and with themselves.    If you can take one class in Child Development at your local college, you'll see there are so many other ways to teach a child proper behavior than spanking.|`|3aba7f50083c1b33a5d3f817288c4836aa	pull out the board of education|`|2dd217fe0396e15617d22fb20a250d09aa	nah we were never able to "beat" them legally but spankings were ok.   most kids think they can call in the authorities if they get a swat but they end up learning that it is not illegal to swat. i know someone who did the two finger flick on their teens mouth when she swore at them. teen called the cops and the cops told her she needs to watch her mouth,respect her parents and sent her to her room right then and there. they did let her know that if they ever left a mark on her or hit her with anything besides an open hand to call back.|`|26895520b344fbc3d9d0e7496f0e96ebaa	That's a personal decision.  It depends on a lot of circumstances, I guess.  In most cases, a good parent will choose to discipline their child in some way so that they can learn from their mistakes.  So, I would say to let the parent decide,,,,,,,,,but then again you have these out of control parents who don't know when to stop hitting, or yelling or whatever the form of abuse is in that household.  I guess that's why there is such a big deal about it.  People are just looking out for the children who can't speak up for themselves.      You worded your question the wrong way.  You wrote that "parents use to be able to beat their kids", like you promote it or something.  Poor choice of words, really.  Not funny at all if that's what you're shootin' for.|`|5z2XY4Jeaa	When my 20 month old son is getting into stuff he will get takin away if he gos back then he gets his hand slapped if he gos back again he will et put in time out and that breaks his heart if he gets down he gets a pat on the butt and put back up there|`|AA10073011	i use alot of time outs when i babysit, i even get down on thier level and say " now why did you do that? usually i get the "i dont know" i have a child size folding chair that when they get into trouble they pull it out of where it sits, and  sit in it for a set amount of time.(usually a min for thier age)  i also if they are older there is no playstation,, time or computer time, depending on how bad they were it will either be just that day or stretch into the next time i get them.|`|DXFvG9RTaa	The most advanced punishment for kids is what my mother did in the past and never once hit us.    1 No visitors    2 No TV for a week    3 No phone calls    4 No smiles with us    5 And no treats.    In order for the child to reduce his/her punishment, he/she has to do some heavy school work.    It definitely worked with me because I always avoid such punishment. I wanted to watch my favorite TV shows, I wanted to call my friends, I wanted to visit them or them to visit me, I wanted my favorite ice cream, and I certainly didn't want to do so many school work ( Homework), especially math... But the punishment I got from my mother turned me into a computer specialist today because I become so good at Math.|`|47def1414e9bb08a9d82a4438ffb9086aa	give'm no scared i was born and raised with beatings taught me good from bad. i mean it wasn't 2 the point where i got brusied.But i glad my parents taught me well.|`|GPFnaKXcaa	One slap, to keep 'em apart from a stove, or an electrical plug, is perfectly fine. Otherwise, you might wanna reconsider. Sometimes, a good yell or a ban is way more effective than a beating.   Believe you me, cuz I was beaten, and I mean really beaten, when I was a kid. Beaten like in cowering into a corner and cover my head with my elbows and my stomach with my legs just to be sure I'd be able to walk out when it stopped. Beaten like in having a broomstick cracked over my back when I was ten, and having an adult grab me by my hair and slam my head against the wall repeated times. I still have scars from an Iron and scissors in my arms and hands. And you know what? When I was twelve, I stood up to my mother and told her that if she layed another finger on me I would first, hit her back, and then, slit her throat while she was sleeping. She didn't hit me again.  So, what's my point?  Kids grow. And they judge their parents, when they do. Just make sure that you keep that in mind in your relationship with your kids. Be fair. Explain. And, sometimes, just sometimes, smack 'em. They won't resent it. An occasional smack won't spawn resentment, regular beatings will. Just think that if you're not nice to them, you might end up in a retirement home from hell...  Also, bear in mind that the rarity of a punishment is directly proportional to its effectiveness.|`|G5ElG6IPaa	the rule should come from within you.  are you out of control?  are you hitting out of anger, or getting a two year olds attention?  is your heartbeating out of your chest with anger? are you spanking anywhere but on a diapered butt?  if yes, then its inappropriate, because you are too far into anger to think clearly and solve the problem of the situation.

Je terminerais en te rappelant que le manque suscite le dsir ne vas plus trop vers elle, sexuellement, j'entend, pendant quelques jours pour voir.ou essaies de pimenter votre vie.  Rappelle toi une chose, ta fiance n'est pas un bout de viande qui "doit te satisfaire au lit"... vous devez vous faire plaisir mutuellement!!!!
bp4l2Oqwaa	yes, there is a time limit. The girl can't wait for u frevr, she will def. want to move on if she thinks ur not interested. Talk to her casually.

If you really like her, you should take a chance and ask her out before it's too late. Hope this helps! Pringlez555

59e12eb1970ad7998f149126fc94ffd3aa	Well this is a pickle! I would talk to him about it. It helps sometimes. But if you rather not, try a different approach. Keep a mental note on what changes when you are with your friends, when you are with him, when you are with his friends, etc... Now look at them is there anything you want him to know about you? If so, are you hiding it when you are aroudn him? If he really likes you you will have no worries about it. But if he doesn't then it will take some time to get over him since he isn't right for you. The one you care about / love should accept you for who you are, and you shouldn't be ashamed to be yourself around anyone.|`|1dDzNdCYaa	u have 2 tell him who u really r. cuz if he finds out by someone elze it'll be a lot worse.    show him the real u and if he doesnt like u the way u really are then he's not the one.|`|GMf0h6Q6aa	Show him the real you and then see if he likes you.

You'll grow to be really reliant. You only like that new guy because he's "hot". Don't play games with him, tell him your differences, tell what you don't like about him, but that does not necessarily mean have a break up. It might be right in the end after all. Don't lie to yourself like that.

Peut-tre que pour toi, ?a signifie tre amoureux ! Plusieurs personnes vivent ces sympt?mes quand elles sont d'abord attires par une autre personne. Tu penses peut-tre aussi  la forte attirance physique que tu ressens pour la personne dsire. Ces sentiments peuvent faire partie du moment o l'on tombe amoureux, mais l'amour, si on lui en laisse la chance, deviendra beaucoup plus qu'une simple attirance.    Il est important de comprendre l'volution de l'attirance  l'amour et de comprendre qu'il y a beaucoup d'lments essentiels  considrer au dbut d'une relation amoureuse.     De l'attirance  l'amour    L'attirance est le dsir intense que tu ressens d'abord pour l'autre personne. L'attirance peut parfois tre ressentie comme de l'amour et ressemble beaucoup  ce qui est reprsent dans plusieurs films, livres ou contes de fes. Si tu es attir par une personne, tu pourrais tre :   * nerveux;   * anxieux;   * jaloux;   * convaincu que tu ne peux pas vivre sans elle;   * incapable de voir qui elle est vraiment parce qu' tes yeux elle est parfaite.   L'attirance est habituellement temporaire et diminue avec le temps.    En gnral, l'amour dure plus longtemps et va bien au-del de la forte excitation sexuelle ressentie lors de l'attirance. Ce qui ne veut pas dire que tu n'prouves aucun dsir sexuel pour la personne que tu aimes, mais que tu ressens habituellement plus que l'excitation lie  l'attirance physique. Si tu aimes une personne, tu :   * la vois comme elle est vraiment;   * acceptes ses dfauts et ses qualits;   * respectes ses opinions;   * partages certaines valeurs et croyances;   * sais qu'elle t'aime, mme si elle est loin de toi.     L'amour ne dpend pas des vtements que porte ton copain ou ta copine , de sa popularit ou si tu as, ou non, des relations sexuels avec lui / elle.    lments  considrer    Tomber amoureux peut s'avrer une exprience magique ou encore un moment frustrant et droutant. L'amour peut tre chaotique, puisant et irrationnel. Et mme si c'est difficile, tu dois essayer de rester quelque peu rationnel quand tu tombes amoureux. Tu devras penser  certains lments importants, par exemple :   * la confiance;   * la rupture;   * les questions lies  la sexualit (utiliser une mthode contraceptive et te protger contre les maladies transmises sexuellement comme le VHI/SIDA, par exemple).     Si tu dcides d'entretenir une relation  long terme avec ton copain ou ta copine, tu voudras s?rement le ou la prsenter  tes parents et tes amis. Cette rencontre est souvent un moment joyeux. Tes parents se demandent peut-tre si ton ami(e) est gentil(le) et si vous faites des choix clairs. ventuellement, ils pourraient accepter la personne que tu frquentes.    Si tes parents n'approuvent pas ton choix, c'est peut-tre parce qu'ils sont inquiets de te voir plonger dans une relation malsaine ou de violence. S'ils se proccupent de la fa?on dont ton copain/ta copine te traite, tu aurais intrt  couter ce qu'ils ont  dire, mme si c'est difficile.    Il est aussi possible que tes parents dsapprouvent ton choix de partenaire  cause de sa culture, sa religion, son age ou son sexe. Tu es peut-tre trs heureux avec ton copain ou ta copine et vis une relation saine, alors que tes parents ne l'acceptent pas. Ce genre de conflit est trs difficile  vivre dans une famille. Tu dois apprendre  rester fidle  toi-mme tout en composant avec un milieu qui n'est pas favorable  tes choix de vie et valeurs personnelles. Combattre la discrimination demande des efforts continus. Tu devras sans doute en discuter avec ton partenaire, et aussi avec d'autres personnes en qui tu as confiance, pour valuer comment tu feras face aux rsistances de ta famille.    Plusieurs questions demanderont une rflexion:     Est-ce que le dialogue avec ta famille est possible?   As-tu habituellement de bons rapport avec eux?   Malgr leurs rsistances, est-ce que tes parents sont ouverts  essayer de connatre ton ami?

L'attirance peut parfois tre ressentie comme de l'amour et ressemble beaucoup  ce qui est reprsent dans plusieurs films, livres ou contes de fes. Si tu es attir par une personne, tu pourrais tre :   - nerveux;   - anxieux;   - jaloux;   - convaincu que tu ne peux pas vivre sans elle;   - incapable de voir qui elle est vraiment parce qu' tes yeux elle est parfaite.   L'attirance est habituellement temporaire et diminue avec le temps.    En gnral, l'amour dure plus longtemps et va bien au-del de la forte excitation sexuelle ressentie lors de l'attirance. Ce qui ne veut pas dire que tu n'prouves aucun dsir sexuel pour la personne que tu aimes, mais que tu ressens habituellement plus que l'excitation lie  l'attirance physique. Si tu aimes une personne, tu :   - la vois comme elle est vraiment;   - acceptes ses dfauts et ses qualits;   - respectes ses opinions;   - partages certaines valeurs et croyances;   - sais qu'elle t'aime, mme si elle est loin de toi.

If he is denying it you can just just break the ice with him and ask him, but I think he really enjoys your friendship and by laying his cards out and letting you know that he likes you might make the friendship awkward or different than it was. Just let time build up to something great. Just maintain being his friend for the time being.|`|AA12146537	Yeah, I think he does.

AA10003164	I am afraid this is a very difficult situation.  Its easy to not seem desperate, but then you run the risk of confusing your intentions.  I say just go for it and make your intentions obvious, don't try to rush things too much, but make sure she knows you are definately interested in getting to know her better and spend time with her.      The problem is that most women say they want a man to be open, but then when he is, they seem to make themselves believe he is just desperate for doing so.  Then also when a guy isn't open about his feelings, they complain they don't know what he wants, and this can lots of times throw you into the forever horrible "friendzone".    My opinion, go for it, and take your chances, just be yourself, if she can't accept that or thinks you are desperate, then she has her own issues, and you are better off knowing that now rather than later.|`|DACGYSlQaa	Don't beg i guess.|`|AA12096154	play hard to get and act like you don't care but in the same since act like you care once in a while,|`|CnuwupbOaa	Act uninterested and do the opposite of what your testosterone makes you feel.

What provokes them? Has there been any recent changes in any ones life?    From the sounds of it, it seems like she's trying to sabotage the friendship because she has of a different motive. She wishes to achieve something behind the friendship which makes her have the "power trips." Though you may value her friendship, put it to the test --don't talk to her for awhile. If she threatens you then continue to be intimidated and back away. Let her have no one to refuge to and see where she goes from there. If she wants to speak with you as way to reconcile, that's when you tell her to how you feel about the way she acts and she needs to shapen up if she even values YOUR friendship.

CnuwupbOaa	Looks do play a factor when seeking intimacy and affection. It's what sparks the interest, but know that the personality will always outweigh the appearance if he intends on a healthy relationship. Personality provides an aura to the woman's look. An aura is a quality that one can see but others cannot. It can give off a positive or negative vibe to the spectator. Looks come first and personality seals the deal to their heart.|`|VBiQYPCpaa	Then I have to way looks over personality. See, guys are very visual based. As I've told my friends before, looks are everything, BUT, personality changes your look. Which means if someone is absolutely gorgeous, then guys will tolerate an unsatisfactory personality more than if the girl was not as pretty. However, most guys find most girls pretty, so it's about personality. This does mean that if someone is ugly, pssh, they've got no chance, because there's too many other good-looking girls out there.|`|a8EJ4KUlaa	I really think personality is the most important feature of an Asian women. I don't mind if a girl argues with me sometimes, but I don't particularly like it when they go overboard on me. Like I'm their punching bag or something. I do like it when the girl actually shows that she cares for me and likes me though. Looks are not as important, but without them personality is useless to me. When it comes to looks the most important characteristic is the face. I mean sure breasts are the best thing ever, but I know that you girls don't like it when men stare at them all the time....so ya thats all my info.|`|1c3d738dd4eb9120591e3bba318ed300aa	looks first, personality second  I haven't dated any asian girls but I have always been attracted to them.|`|29Dn7719aa	i would have looks over personality.|`|c9TAgg4Faa	a little bit of both|`|C53PWTBKaa	argh, it is cruel ~_~  although, its not even both... there are many other aspects to consider    also, is it safe to say, if i choose one, will i still have some of the other? its not cool to have a beautiful bitc*, nor a charming witch^^ i think i choose personality, but only as long as i still have my appetite
8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	Sounds like she needs time and is not ready for another relationship right now.  As her friend, you must respect this and not try to play the matchmaker.  Advise your guy friend not to pressure her and give her time.  If they get together, it will be when they are ready.

He needed to give her her space to show some level of respect. Tell your friend to do what she is doing now, just wait it out. She doesn't need to be quick to get back into dating. In time, she'll come across someone who isn't harmful.
CnuwupbOaa	He does have feelings for you. He's trying to be a dignified "man" by showing that he's uneffected and has moved on, when it's really just things on the surface; a fascade. He is hurt. If a guy goes out with any girl subsequently to cover up then that's just lack of maturity and low self esteem. Try not to acknowledge that he has a new girlfriend, he will most likely try to do something that he wants you to see. He does have feelings for you still, but he didn't have the integrity to express it in the right way --He had to involve another woman to irk you and it's working. Have a casual conversation with him, don't bring the new girl up, then say you got off on the wrong hand too abruptly and ask him if there's anything he would like to say. Tell him you want to know because you still value his friendship.|`|761498210d2ccd2c17bba3349d868ba4aa	best answer is the wright answer

Se me hace run enga?ar a una persona y hacerle cree que existe algo cuando no lo hay.  La infidelidad es un acto de cobarda, ya que la persona que enga?a no encuentra todo lo que quiere en su pareja, pero no tiene el suficiente valor para decirselo por miedo a quedarse solo.  Creo que la infidelidad no se debe de perdonar. Te pueden decir.. ?Ay! comet una estupidez, te juro que te amo!, pero no hay estupidez mas grande que creerle y perdonarlo.|`|bc59ef12838745cbaa60215904644d90aa	yo creo que la infidelidad es algo imperdonabe , creo que si no me sintiera a gusto con alguien si empezara a fijarme en optra persona lo mas honesto de mi parte seria dejar a la que estoy, por que si empiezo a mirirar a alguien mas es por que algo anda mal, y si alguien me lo hiciera mas que el enga?o le reprocharia el no haber terminado conmigo antes si sintio que algo iba mal.

Los latinos son alegres, bailadores, carismaticos, medios locos, apasionados, y romanticos, solo cuando saben que pueden llevarte a la cama.   No se puede generalizar, los italianos se autonombran los ms apasionados del mundo, no dudo que lo sean, pero que no exageren.  En conclusin, creo que no debemos generalizar, en todos los paises de mundo hay hombres romnticos, apasionados, y frios y calculadores.

8879f044cdba27aed21ad23260bbf145aa	I think that you and her need to sit down and talk things out.  The whole losing your virginity to her was a bad thing, since sex takes a relationship to a whole other level.  You need to talk to her, over dinner, or just over coffee, and tell her how you truly feel.|`|CnuwupbOaa	You're feeling lonely and you rather have her presence than nothing at all. You want your friend back and how things used to be, but things are not going to be like that. You've expressed your feelings for her and it tore up the friendship because the mystery is gone now and your feelings for her are out in the open. When you told her you loved her at the time, she was interested in this guy who is now her boyfriend. Those thoughts are what crossed her mind and made her have a little doubt. She felt like she had to choose. It was really just bad timing. She wanted to leave herself open for the possibility of getting with this other guy that she didn't know as well as you. The mystery is what drives people to wanting more. She wanted to see where it would take her.    Don't regret the things that you said, because you meant it. I know you wish you had stayed quiet because just maybe things wouldn't have changed. Right now just hold off from contacting her at all. Don't say anything, just stop talking. Let there be a gap of silence. You're overwhelming her with your words that she doesn't want to talk about it at all. It's wrong for her to give you the silent treatment, but if anything, she would contact you later. If you stop talking to her she'll think of you and reconsider how poorly she handle the situation by ignoring you and how wrong it was. Let her have the gratification of being with this guy. With you out of the picture she'll realize what she had done. She might not, but it's better than being heavily persistant. Let her stew in her guilt and repectfully keep your distance. You haven't done anything wrong, unless you forgot to mention something, but don't feel bad for yourself.|`|tzPYq9Ibaa	I hate to break it to you but she has made it clear that she doesn't want to talk to you. You've written her emails and tried to contact her and she has refused to speak with you on any level.    My advice is to leave her alone. If you keep pursuing she can press harassment charges. Nothing you can say or do will change another person's mind. It's up to them whether they change or not.     If she wants to be friends later down the road she will contact you. The best thing you can do right now is respect her wishes.

UqJR3Urnaa	Most people don't look at the "Spirit" of a person. They only are interested in superficial things. If their "Judge" inside of them deems something or someone not worthy of their acceptance,they Automatically (Like an Automiton,a "learned" response)) give the response that you are experiencing. It's a shame,because many (and I mean MANY) people will never know the wonder of making new and wonderful freindships with others that way. Men in particular,are visual amimals,and that is why you get the crap from them mostly.  Bottom line is this: Most people are asleep,in the world today. They only see what they want to see on the outside,and never discover the BEAUTY that is in everyone,on the inside.   SO, Be BEAUTIFUL and full of Light and LOVE on the inside yourself,Be worthy of yourself,and like a magnet,you will see people attracting to you more positively.  I gurantee it!

They find them interesting; they don't have enough integrity to actually do anything to get themselves involved, but to do the least with very little effort. It's a form of non-verbal communication.

5914d3cce0b8e6170ff830e8b9b2940eaa	I doubt it has anything to do with you. She is, and probably has for a long time, a person with low self-esteem who tries to bring others down to her level in order to make herself feel better about herself.   Stay away as much as possible. Take care of your spouse and your family above anything she wants. When you have to be around her, kill her with kindness, bite your tongue, and let anything she says slide right off your back. People like that normally don't change, so nothing you say will have any effect, but you can help yourself by stop worrying that it may have something to do with her feelings towards you. It doesn't.  If you get the chance, move as far away as you and your family can, have little to do with her (unless she changes drastically), and just be happy with your little family.    I have had to deal with this type of person in my life, and finally just told them I could not be around them and their negativity anymore. That was about 20 years ago. Not having to deal with that person and their negative attitude has helped me gain self-esteem and grow into a caring, self assurred person. Sometimes you have to be a little selfish to protect yourself and those you love.|`|6b54d401c70a709ddaad00b19034fb34aa	Don't be so hard on yourself. I had a mother-in-law that acted as if she hated me, I tried so hard for so long and just gave up. I did my own thing and pretty much ignored her. Then there came the day that she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. It was only after she had to face the fact that she didn't have much longer to live that I realized she didn't hate me at all. She just wasn't comfortable with showing affection and she was, let's just say, a little to controlling. But she had raised 4 sons pretty much on her own. I did not understand her until she was past the point that we could have been friends and could have been a help to each other. Everybody has their own little quirks and we don't always understand each other. For your husbands sake keep the squabbles to a minimum and try to remember my story. I as so sorry I didn't understand mine until it was too late.|`|17c1554d506a01f5fd4cc5a85b71b4a0aa	Dont let her to cause the problems.

Just keep to yourself and steer clear because it's very hard to change someone like that. Good luck.|`|AA11903783	The best thing that you can do is move out and live separately from them. Being with a mother in law always create family disputes so it is best to live on your own. Rent an apartment which is somewhat very far from them so they can't bother you anymore.|`|lcKjQo2maa	You have to remember that your mother-in-law and her kids and the problems she causes between them is not your problem. You didn't cause the problem and you can not fix the problem. You need to concentrate on your marriage and if necessary move away from the problem if it is being brought into your home. Are you still living with her parents? If so you need to get a good enough job that will allow you to take your wife and move into your own place. If you already live in your own place then lock the door when you see the mother-in-law coming. LOL But even if she didn't like you, so what? How does that cause her to make problems with her own kids? Get a grip, you couldn't have that much influence on how someone treats their own kids.  Unless you are making yourself the available listener or problem solver. If this is the case you need to take yourself out of the middle and let them hash it out by themselves, the did before you got there and they will now if you let them. Good Luck.|`|94f6bfe24ed9a99abd599ecc568b2353aa	try to kill with kindness always act like it don't bother you and it will soon get across to her it does not matter to you .

57fcd7c84ade66e5eaaa880537608617aa	Well you gotta be careful. First off his friends dont like it and neither do your parents. Also the trick is can you deal with all of his issues in your own words hes always getting suspended. As regards raping he still needs a real job that can at least contribute because it is extremly hard to break into the entertainment industry. But if you guys really like each other you can always defy your parents and follow your heart. In this life we have to learn that we cant please everyone especially when it comes to the game of love. But hey if he treats you like a princess and you try to get to know his friends then it al should work out because everyone wants their daughter to behappy and be put on a pedestal and his friends just want to see if you can hang with them their probably jsut testing you. So give it a try. Hope all goes well|`|AA10273189	Your desire isn't all attraction for him...but rebellion to stereo typical parents...but in this case there seems to be some elements that are not healthy for you to pursue...tell him to much prevents you from becoming what you hoped it would and remain friends.|`|PMRVRi4naa	Do you really think you guys will work out if his friends already don't like you?

It sounds as if your parents have worked hard to give you the life you have and I don't think that you should go behind their back when they have given you so much, just to date a boy who keeps getting suspended! The fact that your even questioning this makes me think that you know you shouldn't. Your parents have been with you all your life- this guy has been around for two seconds! No I don't think you should date him, sorry!! Tell him that your just not in that stage of your life to date but still wanna hang out!! Don't use your parents as an excuse because you should be proud of them!! good luck!!

Maybe "love" is so direct but I can say that !  The reason why you are nervous / stutter AND shake when you are beside him means that you love that guy but you don't know what to do because you really want that he will do something so special to you such as kiss or you want him to say to you "I love you"!  he hugged you for no reason - the same meaning !  So go like that and reply his affection such as giving a little smile ! hug him! come up to him and so on!  This is the right way!   Be courageous, I'm sure that he will tell you by his way, his love, as a friend or as a lover or .................. guess by his way ! Maybe he wants to kiss you but you don't want to give him so his only way is the hugging !  be courageous my friend !|`|anhPNqDWaa	Relax, take deep breathes and if your friends know him or his friends know you, ask one of them to "accidently bring you up".

lcKjQo2maa	I sympathize for you, you are in a tough spot. It is not okay for him to drink the way he is doing. He is killing himself and just because he threatens to remove heirs from the will no one will help him learn to love life again. He just wants to die and drinking gives him the b*lls to do it. It is no different than handing him a loaded pistol and helping him pull the trigger. I can almost feel sorry for him though, because what I see here is a bunch of people who put money and fortune ahead of someone they should love. does he really have that much money? Has anyone heard of probate court? Why is he so depressed? Has he always been this way? Is he competent enough to make decisions on his own? Why is your husband taking him shopping to buy booze if he is not suppose to drink?|`|94605ac8b5c704f7dfa82344faf72d1baa	So hes a drinker..your looking at liver failure later or starting and Hep diease...its important he gets some help and don't abondon him he probably drinks because he is lonely as well..talk to him
ZVCyQqMmaa	It sounds to me like your parents may be stressing as well. From what you are writing it sounds to me like you have just given up on the fact of being financially responsible for an apartment and expect your parents to pick up the tab. I don't know if your parents are paying for school or other such things for you, but if they are consider how much financial stress that puts on them. Had you taken all this into consideration and got a job ahead of time,you would have been able to save up money to get that apartment and show your parents that you are acting as a young responsible adult and maybe then they would lay off a bit.|`|3a744b764b2502beeee8253047f0cd74aa	Find a roommate, get a job, and be independent.

Now, Let me ask is your parents paying for you college? or are you paying for it? Good question. It may be that your parents are tapped out and the need to concentrate on their own finances right now. If you want an apartment you should be able to do what ever you put your mind to. There are a lot of successful people out here that had to do exactly the same thing at one time. You are no different and you need to learn to survive and succeed on your own. Your parents can only do so much and if you expect them to continuously keep adding to the financial pot to help you then you are really expecting to much of them. It is no wonder everyone is stressed. If you can not afford an apartment and balance 20 units then you may have to balance less units and go to school for a little bit longer. You need to realize that your parents have already done the best they can do and it is really not right for you to expect them to keep dishing  out the cash so you can live comfortably. Please!|`|6300144dc35644f9867d0ae5f9f220b4aa	Tell your parents you want to graduate earlier so you are going to take summer classes and get summer housing.

Meaing she is looking a bad boy to sure here new kinds of fun? Most gangsta just want a girl for sex, so if that is what she wants then expect to be just one of his objects. His loyalty will always be to his crew first.     Finding a gangsta that wants you for sex is easy... finding one who would make a good BF is pretty rare.

Why only during the fair? Is he a Carney? First of all he is not married or bound by any law that says he has to be faithful to this woman. However, the Bible says that two should be married to engage in sex. That it would be better to marry than to spend eternal life in hell. Don't be foolish, my dear you deserve more respect than you even give yourself. Sex is not all there is to a relationship, as a matter of fact there are a lot more important things to consider. Sex makes you feel real good for a few second, most of getting to that few seconds is a lot of sweaty work, then it is over. Not saying it isn't fun, but that is the least important part of a lasting relationship. Be his friend and if it is in the cards for you two to be lasting soul mates you will know it soon enough and he will have all the practice necessary to keep you happy in the sack. Good Luck.|`|vzrbHz9Yaa	Honestly, if you guys are meant to be together, then it will happen without any effort on your part. If it's not meant to be, that's ok too. Have faith in your fate & what is meant to be for you. What you should do really depends on the kind of person you want to be, what you value & how you will view yourself afterwards. You know yourself best. See, you know what you want & that you can probably make that happen, you're just looking for someone to tell you it's ok. Why is that? That you're having an inner conflict. It's for a reason you know. You're just looking for someone to tell you, go ahead, it's ok. You only hear what you wanna hear anyway. Nevermind if the majority tells you otherwise. You'll just hear the one that tells you go ahead. But you see, if you thought there was a chance it was ok, you would not be here questioning it.    The way I look @ it is, he probably is looking to be w you & not w her, but he wants reassurance that you will be there. First of all, aren't you worth taking a risk for? People can punk out like that a lot, you know. They want guarantees. But if no one else, including yourself, gets to have an amazing guarantee of true love, then why should he? Ask yourself, what kind of a person do you want to be with. What kind of person is worthy of you? Someone who will take a risk for you should be right up there. He's the one w the girlfriend, he should come to you, & he should come the same way you come to him, UNAVAILABLE. Just because he seems to like you is not enough. He probably does. But does he like you enough to break up w his girlfriend before offering himself to you? Can he handle the risk?    From what you have written, it seems as though you can have him in one of 2 ways. You could probably 'take him' fast or you could probably have him without having to 'take him', just that you will have to be patient & let things take its natural course. The answer is in whether or not you will have respect for him & for yourself afterwards, if you even care about that @ all. It's important to have respect for him, because if you don't, then what you are really saying is 'I don't deserve to be w someone I respect'. Wanting to respect the guy you're w only comes w respecting & loving yourself first. The only way you'll deem respect from others is (definitely not by demanding it), but by how you respect yourself. Only you can set that example. You've heard all this before, I'm sure. It's weird how that works, but it's true. There's a developmental process to these things, you know. Remember, you crawl before you walk. Messing w that is not natural & can be cause for developmental delays & I'm sure you don't want that in a new relationship. Good-luck, I'm sure in the end you'll make the best decision for you. & if you don't, hey you learn for next time.|`|RYGRtpG4aa	I was in the same thing you are in now. Everyone have there own opinion and of course you will only go with what your heart says. The advice I have for you will only be my opinion and I say if it has been three years and y'all are off and on, you might want to be forward with this guy and ask him to think about the future. Not only for him but also for the two of you. My situation got me to love this guy so much that all we can do is think about each other and even though we have people trying to break us up you have to pray about and leave it into GOD hands. That is if you believe in the same GOD I do. Ask God for strength and encouragement. He shall show you the right path.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Good question... here is my 2 cents.    1. Someone who messes around because they like to do it.  2. Someone who messes around to get things out of it like money or gifts.  3. Someone who is just mean and nasty to people in general.  4. Someone who messes around because they don't really care about themeselves.  5. Someone who pretends to mess around, but really is afraid too and likes to mislead guys for the fun of it.     Hope that helps... and if you don't know what they are then you are probablly not one of them.

Ce qui veut dire qu'il ne devrait y avoir un secret quelque part entre toi et lui! mme le travail, si tu as des problmes, tu peux lui en parler et lui de mme envers toi !     je te dis, s?rement il a fait exprs d'teindre son tlphone mais il a ses raisons, ds que tu lui parles ou que vous voyez, demandes lui calmement, peut-tre qu'il a tant de problmes  rsoudre, et il veut tre seul ou bien comme vous ne se faisiez pas confiances; il ne veut pas te parler de tout cela!     Il faut une confiance mutuelle entre vous deux et discutez calmement, sans blamer l'autre ! C'est tout !    Et c'tait un cas que j'ai bien vcu mais la communication s'avre importante! on se comprendra ensuite !     Mais s'il ne veut plus parler avec toi, alors demande lui et sparez-vous, c'est mieux ! entre deux tres qui s'aiment, tout est efffac par un amour ardent !    courage
CnuwupbOaa	I believe you like her. Why would you ask such a question and accentuate that you have no interest for her? Leave it alone for a while. You might be smothering her with your need for communication. Let her speak to you. Ask once, and let her reply. If no reply then don't heavily persist trying to seek an answer out of her. The problem was that you gave her the notion of the doubt by drawing the line between eachother. And so, her interest for you discontinued. She wanted to be more than friends, but she learned that it wasn't going to happen.|`|xxj3zs9aaa	Ask her what happend between and what she thinks. If you can't get a good answer, put her aside.|`|AA12254888	yes... just leave her alone you are messing around her and thats not fair... i personally hate when guys show interest and then will say i am really not interested in you but still show like they are interested thats definetely a bad game... move on if you are not interested in her just stop messing around with her.|`|xxYGupa2aa	just quit talkign and texting her, you dont have to completely ignore her, just stop being so friendly.  just nod or wave at her when you see her.  see if she comes to you, if she deos, it was meant to be, if she moves on, forget her.

Mais dans le cas o vous tes tous les 2 travailleurs, tu dois aussi  mon avis contribuer  l'panouissement de ton foyer : financirement comme dans tout autre domaine.    Moi, j'aime bien faire des cadeaux  mon ami. Et quand il me demande de complter ou de lui preter, je ne demande pas remboursement. ?a me fait plaisir et je trouve cela +t?t complice.|`|bee8073d6aa63a8509d4f9998217cc3faa	on est au 21me siQle, pas au 12 me...  tu dois avoir un problme de dislexie...!!!|`|UMbN5Xziaa	oui j suis d'accord, il n'a qu'a en faire plus pour subvenir aux besoins de la famille... bien sur si tu vois qu'il a fais le maximum et que financirement c encore la merdre, et bien dpanne le quand meme car t'as pas le choix... surtt si c par amour... l'argent ne fais pas le bonheur alors largis ton esprit et aide le a trouver un boulot plus lucratif.... et puis j'espre que ton mec ne te demande pas d'argent pour s'acheter de la bire par exemple, l ?a serait le comble de l'insouciance... bon courage|`|f02debc6111cda9f673869b86db4182eaa	bah c'est 50 / 50 en fonction de tes revenus et du siens  ya pas de raisons que ce soit toujours aux hommes de payer surtout si tu gagne ta vie.  21 siecle les femmes on voulu leur indpendance et bien l'argent en fait parti   avec mon cheri ce sera pareil|`|8f040eed157f87b0aaac92e353056bdaaa	Personnellement je ne suis pas de ton avis. A partir du moment o l'homme et la femme travaille, chacun doit participer aux charges du mnage en fonction de ses revenus (style pourcentage). Mme si l'homme gagne 4000  et que cela suffirait  faire vivre la famille, ce n'est pas une raison pour que la femme mette de c?t ou dpense pour elle ses 1000  par exemple. Moi je pars du principe, en gardant cet exemple, que s'il y a une facture de 1000   payer, l'homme met 800  et la femme 200 . Mais bon... c'est mon point de vue.|`|1KzDEjShaa	De nos jours, dans un couple il est ncessaire de s'entraider. On ne remet pas tout dans les mains de l'homme.|`|Yfm4qqB2aa	non pas dans mon cas|`|GS57BSciaa	chacun doit faire selon ses revenus. Si tu gagnes mieux ta vie que lui, pourquoi tout garder pour toi? et si un jour ton mec perd son emploi? est-ce que tu vas le laisser dans la galre ou est-ce que tu prendras en charge le foyer? en tout cas je pense que si tu l'aimes rellement vous devez partager 50/50, c'est ?a aussi vivre en couple  notre poque !!|`|2f5133b4b3f8053e316f8a85fa3fe8e7aa	Argent ?  Je crois que ce ne serait pas si difficile d'en parler en couple ! ds qu'il y a un problme, la faute est de la communication et de la comprhension !    Bon je vais te dire que c'est l'homme qui doit en tout cas subvenir aux besoins du foyer ! la femme est l'aide, dit la Bible des chrtiens !    Mais bon, les DEUX tres sont unis pour crer UN FOYER, alors tout devient unique, son corps, ses besoins, ses finances et tout! Il faut tout simplement savoir les utiliser pour le meilleur de la famille !     Eh, il faut en discuter et parler calmement !

UdoyBrnuaa	Are you ready to be kissed? Here are some ways to make it perfect. Good luck!  Steps       1. Get together. When you find someone you really like, ask the person out.     2. Be sure to communicate with them. Share your feelings so they feel comfortable around you.     3. Make sure you brush your teeth in the morning. There is nothing worse than kissing someone with bad breath.     4. Lean your head on their shoulder as if you are about to fall asleep. Look up at them - if their hand goes around to let you in, go for the kiss. If not, they are not ready.     5. Relax and be at ease about it all. If they do not go for the kiss, accept it and don't push.       Tips        * Keep in mind that many are shy about kissing--but this doesn't mean they don't want to kiss you. Pay attention to body language. If you think your someone might be suffering from this ailment, try kissing them! Just be mindful of their reaction. If they pull away, or are angry, be mature about it, and don't take it personally. Maybe you should try again later      * The fastest way to have a first kiss is just to get close to the person and kiss them. Most people won't complain.      * If you don't mind having an impersonal first kiss, join in on a game of Truth or Dare. The most popular dare is to kiss someone. Be warned though: you may end up kissing someone you don't much fancy (unless you get a friend to dare your crush to kiss you). The same is true for Spin the Bottle.      * Don't change for them - stay the same.       Warnings        * Make sure you don't have any food stuck in your teeth.      * Make sure your breath smells good.      * Watch out for mono and colds.     Hope it helps...  ):-)|`|be8ff2b693aae0625c3f229400f71467aa	Go up to her and place your lips on hers.  Kiss her gently, don't be too rough. she may approach you and feel more attractive if you start out with being very light with your kiss.|`|EX8OboKLaa	just lean in at a good time and kiss
VNG7ug5Taa	Theyre not friends at all.  You need to leave them alone before this gets out of hand.  Try and talk to someone that will help.

Talk to someone .|`|Wu9bOic9aa	no its disgusting dont hang out with these 2 boys anymore they are making a fool of you and if you do carry on with them then they will start telling people what you have done with them and you will get a bad name for nothing get rid of them you dont need friends like that , they cant think much of you to be treating you in thisway|`|98oqDvCUaa	stay in school|`|4db4e56392492424b7d32a3addcaa645aa	You are a joke to them.... nothing more.  save that booty for someone who respects you.|`|EX8OboKLaa	ok u think ur confused i am even more confused with what you wrote|`|74a1617031884711461b6f6b70710b80aa	No girl, it's not good.  Listen, guys talk sh*t to each other all the time...that's true.  But when they really like a girl, they usually don't lie about her reputation (ie. Saying they had sex with her but didn't).  Let me tell you something that I've learned...just cause a guy says he wants to have sex with you doesn't mean he likes you and that he's thinking nice things of you.  All guys want to have sex with you if you look good..it's not really a compliment.  We women need to get over being flattered when guys say they like our bodies or want to have sex with us.  Wouldn't you rather be with a guy who says you have a great smile, are smart, have a great personality, and are sweet?    You don't need a guy to want you just for sex..or to be talking about you that way.  It's lame for him to be saying this to your friend..it shows he has a big head and is just thinking with his d*$k.  Lose him.|`|AA11904491	If I said that about a girl that I liked then I am positive that she would not want to be around me.

Dcouvrez les secrets et les particularits gographiques des baisers.    Le premier contact physique       Le baiser est une tape importante ; il marque le dbut dune relation, la rencontre sensuelle entre deux corps. Tmoignage de tendresse par excellence, cest aussi lingrdient indispensable des prliminaires amoureux.                Lart du baiser       Embrasser, cest tout un art ; le kamasutra y consacre dailleurs un chapitre entier.    Cependant, il nexiste pas de rgles en matire de baiser, ni de baiser standard : lessentiel est dy mettre son c?ur. Un baiser russi, cest un instant o deux bouches entrent en communion, ce quelle que soit la technique employe.     Il existe plusieurs types de baiser : le baiser rgulier, lvres contre lvres, le baiser prolong, srie de petits baisers sur les lvres, et bien entendu le french kiss, qui implique lutilisation de la langue.    Le baiser rgulier est un effleurement dlicat du bout des lvres. Celles-ci peuvent tre fermes, soit lgrement entrouvertes. Au choix, vous refermerez trs doucement vos lvres sur la lvre suprieure ou infrieure de votre partenaire. Quant  savoir sil faut fermer les yeux ou pas, cest avant tout une affaire de go?t. Certains prfreront les fermer afin de mieux se concentrer sur leurs sensations, dautres aimeront entrevoir leur partenaire durant cet change.    Le french kiss est un pas en avant dans la dcouverte de lautre. Aprs une srie de petits baisers sur les lvres, lun des partenaires entrouvrira sa bouche : naturellement, lautre le suivra. La tte lgrement penche pour ne pas tre gn par votre nez, vous introduirez votre langue dans sa bouche. Commence alors la rencontre sensuelle, douce, humide, entre deux langues qui chercheront tout dabord  se conna?tre, pour ensuite entrer en mouvement. Ne soyez pas press, plus les mouvements seront langoureux, plus le baiser sera agrable. Laissez vous guider par votre envie et surtout par celle de l'autre, soyez toujours  l'coute de ses dsirs. Le secret dun baiser russi : la communication naturelle entre les deux partenaires, qui sans aucun mot, accordent leur rythme mais aussi les sentiments que lon met dans ce baiser.|`|a8ac712c75da4fea18cf5921582e7fddaa	Avec le coeur et le plus naturel possible|`|91c1a532628d69d6661ced6555504ee8aa	il faut quelle le fasse avec le coeur sinon ...  bon courage|`|a9482242c9ffa7d8792541613518bac0aa	il faut etre mari, sinon elle sera trs decue.

Good Luck  :)|`|9Ci5beedaa	Since that she knows you should try to talk to her but not so akward talk to her like she is very good friend of yours|`|qDpcTx26aa	If she was laughing and embarrassed, she likes you. Do something about it. Ask her to a movie or to hang out at the mall or something. The worst thing she can say is no. Just remember that we rarely regret taking chances when it comes to the opposite sex. The regrets we have are the chances we didn't take.|`|Si5chFlfaa	Well I'm not sure but if you think there's a chance then you should just go for it...  You'll never know unless you try.|`|xN7opEJ6aa	The reason why you haven't talked is probably b/c she likes you too. You just need to get to know her, and i bet she'll think you a great guy! Don't be shy, take a chance, there nothing to lose, as long as you tried.

6c83086ac56b1873cb365b6abd1892a0aa	I would just leave her alone, until she comes up to you, she wants a friendship from what I can gather, and nothing more, so just be her friend and be patient, and you will never know what will develop from there!

Then they will convince her to go out with you. That usually happens anyways. no gurantee|`|uByWc8MQaa	just try to cassualy slip it in a conversation and then tell her she can bring some of her friends or something but there is also the possibility that she has a bf so becareful and ask her about that first! Good luck|`|hjCtWHwfaa	honestly, i would say find another girl. this one obviously likes to flirt--but doesn't like committment.
CnuwupbOaa	Guys like a woman with courage to ask them out. They don't have the confidence in themselves because they're more afraid of rejection, and so they rather sit in bliss through admiration.
rn3SQOBVaa	Well first, just make friends with her, and don't be gross, girls hate that. Just talk and eventually you will be come friends. Sometimes it talkes a while, but when you are friends you can be more comfortable around her.|`|BCGuUmX4aa	just talk to her a little... im having the same problem except im the girl in the scinece class. this guy has poked me in the back a few times and i think he is staring at me. I didn't really respond to it, and i think his frined told me i didnt like him.. but hes wrong.. the guy is the coolest ever, i just couldnt get up to talking back 2 him.... TALK 2 HER ABOUT SOMETHING! dont make her feel awkward by like sitting on her desk..... or yeah sure sit on her desk but talk 2 her and pull her aside from every1 else. she could b shy like me, but really outgoing w her friends.... if u sit by a semi obnoxious frined dont let him scare or mae her feel uncomfortable.... show u rpersonality but dont scare her......... make sure ur friend doesnt ytalk 4 u.... unless u flirt and cas talk.... if she doesnt answer except for a "yes" or a "no" leave her alone 4 a little, she prob really likes you and gets nervous    watever oter people may tell u DONT LET HER GO!!! unless u actually ask her if she likes you and she says "no". She could b really hard to read bc shes quiet, but mabe she is quiet because she isnt 2 close w the people in that class and mabe she is nervous about u......        good luck!!!!!|`|HkdD93Zkaa	talk to her. more and more till u start flirting. expose how u feel but dont tell her it.|`|urSARnmVaa	B real wit shawty if she can respect that then forget her|`|e7b63f7cbe60b6755095459b0c5291b4aa	yu cant gt any1 tolike yu lol  they to lik yu by themselves.  sorry man but thats th way it goes ive learned it the hard way   id suggest u leave her alone and find some one else   or even better to find out wether she really likes yu (try) to make her jealous by goin out wit her friends- mak sure she sees and knows abt it  and if she really likes you.........yull know  good luck in watevr yu do|`|0rTSZsyTaa	do something 2 make the class exciting make sure she is awake just do something intresting let her know u have an awesome personallity if there is a guy who sits around u talk about new stuff daily or stuff u like|`|uylkiLIVaa	Since she doesn't even notice you, get her to. Make friends with her, start there. Find out more about her. Let her know more about you. Maybe flirt a little. Then, if you still like her (not saying you won't, but there's a chance) you can ask her out.|`|76d47659b59183c401042a8ed3f68e0caa	Casually chat with her, if she sits next to you it shouldnt be difficult. If you're having problems finding something to talk about, then talk about whatever experiment you're doing; pretend you dont understand it and ask if she can explain it to you. Ask her if she did anything over the weekend, did she enjoy herself? This way you'll also find out what interests her. Remember: if she really didnt like you, she wouldn't sit next to you. Good luck, youngun'|`|16MI4buAaa	You talk to her. Make her laugh. Ask her to help you with the work. IM her if can get her screen name. Then ask her to go on a walk/go to the fair. Don't ask her to the movies, because you don't get to talk then. Good luck! =)|`|YJlGnnyraa	I think i can help. When you pass by her in the hall say a causal heyy or hi.  when she starts to say hi back to you, give her a compliment on what shes wearing. Then in science class she should start to notice you. Then when a dance starts to come ask her your date to it. If she says yes make sure the dance is  fun and enjoyable for the both of you. At the dance also try very light flirting.    I hope this helps you.  Tell me how it goes at:  xosmallfryox@yahoo.com

qxZ7IK9Eaa	Thanks for asking this question. I am going to give u a great answer.    I look for 7 qualities in a  best friend. To begin with.    1. A best friend is someone, who walks in when the whole world walks away from u.    2. A best friend is someone, no matter how busy they are they will always make time for u, esp when ur in any problem.    3. A best friend is someone, who goes out of their way to help u or to be with u or to do anything that is only for u.    4. A best friend is someone who lends u an ear,a shoulder and comfort u.    5. A best friend is someone on whom u can trust, depend and most of the all u feel comfortable sharing ut thoughts, secrets with.    6. A best friend is someone with whom u can be ur self. U dont need to behave ur best behaviour.    7. A  best friend is someone who cares for u, who loves u, who guides u and who scolds u when ur wrong.    This is what I expect from my best friend. Thanks for asking this question coz I always wanted to tell someone, what kind of a best friend I want.    Good luck!|`|OMAS7oNOaa	you can have more than one friend...but a TRUE best freind will stick by you forever|`|e07vP8XAaa	- Best friends are people who are always there for you    - They want to share almost everything about their personal life with you    - they listen to you whenever you want to speak to them    - they always try not to get jealous of you    - they are always happy with your progress or success    - they will protect you whenever u are in trouble, even willing to take the blame to save your name (& asss).    - they will never go have fun without you, they'd always invite you along and share their fun.    - they will always keep your secrets well protected.
iA4c0kr9aa	Personally, given the above info, I'd bet he is.  A woman can usually tell from her heart, as well as the clues given to us by the men we love when things aren't right.  First, the phone calls are eratic and chances are used to be oftenand regular.  The fact tht he is "busy" and that you don't see each other very much clearly gives him the opportunity to be with someone else.  You can look online if you know the ins and outs, at his cell phone usage, pick out the numbers you don't know and use sites like anywho.com to look them up. you could also, pending you know the password or secret answer info on his email accounts, check as far as he who has been corresponding with online.  You can also try trailing him with a friend in an unfamiliar (to him)  vehicle and see where he goes, who is with, etc.  It's kind of a pain in the rear having to go through this.  but, when a simple heart-to-heart talk doesn't work and you really wanna know the truth, a woman will go to extremes. Just be certain if you do these things to cover your tracks as well, and be certain you really can handle finding out the truth.  Good luck!|`|01EUkkdSaa	Just ask him what have you got to lose|`|bhzu4nL9aa	You can check his phone calls and show up at his house or work place without calling him.

CnuwupbOaa	That's quite an ambiguous question. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and therefore people have their own personal preferences depending on what association they may have. As people get more involved we tend to look past the visual qualities. Neither is incompetent.
CnuwupbOaa	No, because one, you're being a liar and not owning up to what you have to put up with. Two, you lied for his sake. Although you're still young it's completely immature than the age you should be acting. You could at least act mature by not saying such ridiculous things.    Let him ask you out and just respond with something like, "I'm not allow to date until I'm 18." That way his feelings won't be crushed with the idea that he has no chance, but he'll surely stop doing what you don't like. If you reject him harshly you'll just feel bad yourself, no matter how ugly he may seem to you.|`|AA12371334	no!! NEVER lie. i think you could have handled it better. you should have just carried on like normal, and if he actually did ask you out, and it wasn't just a rumor, than you could politely decline. you could say you dont have time for a boyfriend right now, you could say you arent interested in being in a relationship right now, you could say you just arent really interested in a relationship with him, you could say theres someone else on your mind right now, etc.    making up a fake story about a fake bf was really childish. i think youll regret it.|`|ftdd64E3aa	No, You should Never Lie  ..Now your going to have to lie again because "Nick" will never come to beat him up.... now he will be laughing at you.   You should have just told him (if he even asked you) You dont think you two have very much in common and you dont want to date him .|`|toIKOgckaa	No.. it wasn't right.

CnuwupbOaa	You should trying talking to him instead of showing that you're moving forward and putting him behind you. When you break up with someone it's better for the both you if you let each other go on good terms. That way they're are no hard feelings, but it just wasn't working out; it was incompatible. Let the break up be a mutual thing. Give him a few minutes of your time to formally say goodbye. I think that's what he wants since you seemed to have suppressed it by moving fast into dating someone else.

That is, lend money while holding on to a valuable possession of theirs; they get it back when you get your money back.    Edit: As long as I haven't been rated yet, I might as well add this.  Ben Franklin said, "Do not lend money to friends; you will lose them both."|`|4KCiRtiPaa	Look, all I can say is don't loan money to them.
CnuwupbOaa	Your dependency was built from your early teenage years, so the actions you take now are much more transparent to where it's not seen as morally wrong. I believe that you've done it so many times you're used to it by now. You see no guilt in indulging to do so.     Not only is it wrong, but you also allow others to take complete advange of you whether you allow them to or not. Also if you can't take your own life seriously why should anyone take you seriously now or in the near future? Yes, there's that common saying, "It's just sex." That's completely foolish. Would a woman still have said that if they were raped? You should be aware of what date rape is, but in this case you shouldn't be blaming anyone. You seriously need to fix this habit of submitting yourself.|`|AA11545997	Honey, if you live in a small town, they already know, your NOT fooling anyone.  And yes, your acting trampy, and not setting morals for your children.  Seeing mommy drunk again, how nice. and by the way, whos' this guy?|`|xBxmMunsaa	Where do you live? I'm just kidding....you are not a bad person for doing this.|`|4tFNQzn2aa	yes|`|AA11123333	Maybe the reason you cant have sex sober is because you know what you're doing is wrong and being drunk somehow offers you an excuse for what you do.  Im assuming you're single.  Maybe you're just lonely.    You have a child, but you're lonely.  So you have sex with guys you're kinda crushing on.  And you're always drunk because you cant deal with the reality of it.  or dont want to.    Please try.  And may God bless you.|`|oPXmsU9Aaa	There will be many people that will tell you that you are being a s.l.u.t. however, you have needs and I say that if you are comfortable with this then continue and to hell with those that want to judge you.
CnuwupbOaa	Most 18 year old girls don't. This one in particular that you have in mind likes this older man because he has a financial establishment as in a steady job. Enough money to support a young girl who will depend on him to make her happy. The girl is just naive and only seeing what's on the surface with this guy. She's fascinated by the aura he projects and how others see him.
CnuwupbOaa	You can do things for yourself a little more, that way your actions aren't all that much of a fabrication. If you're always carefully being mindfull of her eventually it'll get tired. There needs to be a time where you relax and she'll be ok with that as well. Try caring less about yourself and how you present yourself it gets quite fraudulent.|`|POFdWpUzaa	What more can you do? Well, first of all, don't lose yourself in your new relationship. Make time for friends and family. Do things that have always made you happy. If she doesn't like that you want to do things without her then she is not for you. Don't compromise yourself and your happiness for anyone, ever. Encourage her to pursue what she likes to do. Up front make a plan to have certain date nights and certain nights for time with friends away from each other, you can always meet up later. Don't look at other girls when you are with her, do things for her that she doesn't expect and she'll know you are thinking of her when you're not together. Give her a call when you're with your friends just to say hi and you're thinking of her and can't wait to see her on your next date night. Encourage each other to continue growing as individuals and your relationship will be stronger for it.  Have a wonderful summer!!|`|s0AvWoNaaa	3 days? 16? lol so cute!|`|gRn7RinBaa	well make sure to make out with her BEFOREshe breaks up with you.... or else thats bad.... i tried it..... it doesnt work....|`|466xplBRaa	try communication.... caring... understanding... and above all be yourself|`|hMrzJwfjaa	u r cool, but be urself its better, feel what u want so show it to ur g-friend|`|oJx1sSPxaa	You can be honest and tell the truth...something sadly lacking in our society. Girls her age want to be complimented for any aspect of themselves...in an honest way. Don't compliment her...just for the sake of pumping up her ego. Pay attention to what she finds important. Support her when she is upset about something someone said or did. If she is telling you...she is hurting and needs you to lean on. ALWAYS be there for her...but don't let yourself become a doormat. Respect her boundaries...physically and emotionally. This is the time in most girls lives that set the standards for the their emotional and sexual development for the next 5-10 years. She may be ready for love, she may be ready for sex...but she may be ready for neither. This is where the listening comes in...keep your mouth shut for the first couple of weeks and find out where you are in comparison. Treat her like you would like guys to treat your sister. You have manners...open doors for her, pull out her chair, hold her hand, walk on the street side of her...make her feel special...like the first girl you've ever met. Go to the movie SHE wants to see and be excited about it. The more you make the early weeks about her, the more she will appreciate you...but, at the same time, don't let her abuse you and make you follow her like a puppy...you are looking for mutual respect and honesty. Don't lie to her...all it will do is lead to more lies to cover the one you told. If looks are important to her, make sure she sees that you care about your appearance. Ask questions, ask questions, ask questions...girls love to talk about themselves, their friends, their interests. The more you know about her, the better your chances of picking the right thing to do on a Saturday afternoon...or picking the right restaurant...or the right gift or card for special occasions. Always pick blank cards and write something from the heart...99% of greeting cards are cheesy, and never say quite what you want to say. And finally, be flexible...there are a lot of changes and hormones going crazy at 16...be ready to change your plans or the topic of conversation at any second...but most of all, be yourself, because that's who she will fall for...GL...Kes|`|YR9H36PGaa	if she truely loves you she will love you no matter what you do so just be yourself|`|yiuU94Czaa	I think you've done enough hunny!

Good for you!  Anyway, just be there for her and do little special things once in a while to let her know you are thinking about her and that you care about her.  I promise you guys will have some hard times and the best thing you can do is hear her out and try to see things in her perspective. Good Luck!|`|xsIBEimjaa	well...be honest at all times no matter wat. never try 2 pressure ur grl 2 do anything she doesnt want 2. b understanding but let her kno ur feelings 2.consider everthing she tells u and  discuss anything dat can and/or will have any effect on ur relationship.

Listen to her and try to catch little things that she says she likes (without asking) and surprise her with little gifts every once and a while. If she likes to talk on the phone, call her when you say you will. If you're coming over, don't be late. Be polite and friendly to her family. Since you are just starting to date her, take turns about where to go to eat, what movies to watch/rent. Pay careful attention to her families rules on dating and don't break them. Have her home at curfew. Be honest and in return, expect these same qualities from her (except the gift thing unless someone tells her). Do not treat her like a doormat and do not be treated as one. Respect each other. My now 17 year old daughter began her relationship with her boyfriend just like this 19 months ago and they are very happy. Good luck to you both.
khvZtJCFaa	Sweetheart, I have no fear of any woman or kind of woman. Any I might, like perhaps diseased whores, don't really come across my life.

But what's a man to do?|`|h25coBpEaa	les femmes qui t'ignorent et en plus se savent belles,  par exemple toi|`|ccoVWsNPaa	Do what best for their country instead of the one they love.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Sometimes I feel like the only white guy on here that has dated black women.    I think you can learn a lot about the world by dating someone from a different background then your own and I personally have always been a victim to the whole opposites attract thing. I know there are a lot of white guys who talk themsevles out of dating a black women because of potential roadblocks they me see, but I agree the are missing out by doing that.     There seems to be a lot of black or mixed women coming here and asking these kinds of questions... and sometimes I wish I were still single or could clone myself so I can prove to you that white guys can be everything you want in a man. In the end color of the skin does not dictate success or failure in relationships, but it can have a profoundly positive or negative effect. If everyone had dated at least once outside there race, the world would be a much better place!     Dan|`|2iEIbRrWaa	MY WHITE BOYFRIEND (SOON TO BE FIANCEE?) JUST FINDS HIMSELF ATTRACTED TO US MORE.

They seem so open and straight up and I always feel like I can do or say anything to them. Sistas are always getting the short end of it 'cause black guys are always chasing white girls and so many white guys are repulsed at the thought of going with a "n-word" girl. Dudes, you don't know what you're missing! Black ladies are the coolest, no bulls**ting, down to earth women on the planet. You can't find a better freind anywhere else in the world. White girls are so into themselves that it makes me sick. But black women are so grateful to a man who treats them right, and all you guys who ignore them - good! That's more for me. I hope this doen't sound racist or stereotypical because I certainly don't mean it that way. I can't find enough words to compliment these fine women.|`|sr5OcsFraa	Sure.

You can't make "anything new" in your life without changing yourself first. Try to focus on what you want different and then just act it out.

AA11305351	In my opinion, he should get 10%, with the remaining 90% going to the 3 other siblings. I think that would be more than fair to him, and to you.|`|hwVYB84Haa	It's only my opinion but if you don't expect anything from anyone, anything you get will be a bonus.    They got married and formed a FAMILY and no matter what the circumstances your half brother is still family as you are half sister to him.    It's not for you to try and figure out what is fair it is for your mother and stepfather. They seem to have it together as far as being fair.    So keep your nose clean and out of their business, It will be your business when they pass and  you collect anything they may have left you.    You probably got extra from them as you grew up in their environment which he didn't I'm sure.     Let them do their thing and just tell them you will respect their decision what ever it would be if they do ask|`|PcwshkIkaa	Hi.  Now that is a tough question.  I suppose someone could sit down and try and figure out a division between 4 siblings with his "share" being half that of everyone else's.  The only reason I say that is because it is your mother's life estate and three of the siblings are hers.  If you and your full siblings want to share more then be it after the fact so to speak.  I'm not sure there is a real happy answer to that question.  Wills and estates can be soooooooo touchy for everyone involved.  Hope this helps.

cb25f64a55506c710b402a0a8995da55aa	Sounds to me like you need to be reassured that she loves you.  Talking to her might be pointless, because you would have little effect.  Girls have that "bond" and can tell each other everything from what they at at lunch to when they started their period (yeah I know gross huh).  You need to talk to your girlfriend's friend -- you know the one YOU are closest to.  Tell her that you need her to talk to your girl for you.  Tell your girl that you are confused if she loves you or not.    My wife is a stubborn mule when it comes to that.  She never says THANK YOU (for the smallest things), or I LOVE YOU.  I had to talk to her best friend to get her to go to the gyno -- it took my wife's friend 1 week to "bug" my wife into going, AND it took me over 6 months.  Need I have said it was over 3 years between appointments (1 year is the norm).  Thankfully there was nothing major that was found wrong with her.    jk|`|54ee949a29ec434c807c9728f22ca599aa	Buy her a diamond with a gold (or white gold) circle attached to it.|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, take her out on a date together.  Invite her over to your house one day.  She will likely be shy at first in a relationship but will open up to you.  This is usually how it goes.  Just take your time and let her take your time.  Believe her friends, they are a good source of information.  Just don't ask them for things a lot, because they may begin to think that your insecure and have lack of confidence.  Women like confidence in a man, you may portray a wrong message to her friends.  Just give her some time.  Do a suprise to her, like a suprise kiss or something.  Do something first like putting your arm around her.

Next, you cannot force someone to be other than who they are.  Depending on how long you have been together she may need time to feel comfortable with the relationship before she starts showing more affection etc. Finally, talk to her  yourself....communication is an essential key to a relationship.  If all else fails, perhaps you should play the field and find a girl who naturally shows her affection in the way that makes you feel secure.|`|e8f990ffdbf3bb4e7e0e53a9296b61a9aa	Talk to her. This is the only way she will know how you feel. You said she is more traditional, maybe she doesnt believe it is her place act such a way. Tell her how you feel and give her a chance to prove herself.|`|IDpLstdnaa	*grins* we won't show. Sorry! if she's shy, then her showing a lot of affection would be uncomfterable for her.|`|y1lM5Gqjaa	give it time rushing things ruins the relationship.|`|f9f20da4e480f13460decdf378b5f837aa	Takes a little time.  If they shy it will take some time before she opens up to you totally.  Relax and just treat her right and she in time will show more affection over time.|`|k8kIA9uraa	Give her a little time and a little more space. If you do she will start coming to you if she really cares. Be careful that you aren't over doing it and smothering her, that could make her back off. Good luck!|`|O79BfHZxaa	When I meet someone like that, I tend to just be a little bit more aggressive and share my feelings with her.  What's important is that I try establish a comfort zone with her so she would be less shy with me and can express her feelings much easier.  Sometimes shy girls just need a little push from guys in order to break their shell but just don't go too overboard.
QimXCTJMaa	Okay so first things first. If you recently broke up with the girl that called you every night, you obviously ignored phone calls you recieved while talking to her... so the people that called you, just don't call you anymore because you ignored them. Maybe you should call them instead. When you call someone, they'll know that you want to talk to them, and then they'll start calling you! So hopefully now you'll be getting those phone calls!|`|cf04f397e91e28e5843cb5006b25df22aa	i'm guessing that everybody knows you because you're in special ed or something. half your question didn't even make sense. if you speak like you write/type, then no wonder they don't call you.  maybe those "friends" really aren't too much of your "friends" after all.

oJx1sSPxaa	What I cannot understand when I read this, is where have you been? It seems like you have been in the Twilight Zone...NONE of this has come to your attention...until ANOTHER mom brought it to you...also, was your husband in the same lost world? I don't want to hammer you, but I am just VERY confused about how you let this happen...and are now panicking when a lot of the fault lies solely in your lap.    I'll bet you have a great house and nice cars and lots of money...but a daughter who you hardly know. I have seen this my whole life...and it makes me very sad. I'm not sad about your daughter's behavior (although the whole Girls Gone Wild thing makes me a little ill). I'm sad that you have a daughter who is a complete stranger to you. They have been together for three years...she is one year from being an adult...and NOW you want to be her mom. The whole "princess" talk is even more and stronger evidence about how out of touch you are with her. I'm going to include here my answer to what part I played in teaching my children about love and sex:    I taught my son about sex between grade school and high school. I gave him the basics and told him that I would answer ANY question he had about sex. I don't know if I would have talked about homosexuality as much, if his aunt wasn't gay.  I really focused hard on STDs and pregnancy. I told him several stories of friends or relatives (names changed, of course), and how lives were ruined and self-esteem obliterated through (mostly) casual sex.    HOWEVER, the point that I hammered into him over and over and over, were issues like rape, date rape, consent, love and responsibility. This may be tough for most parents, as they choose to pretend that children will learn the best way to handle these things on their own.    I told him that if he was ever convicted of rape or any other sex crime, that he would go straight to juvenile hall, do not pass go, do not collect $200. I believe that this is the area which most parents fail on. I read and answer messages on this site about force and coercion all the time, and it makes me sick. These issues were THERE when I was younger, but they seem to have become epidemic. If you do not love your children enough to teach them about these issues, then you are a failure as a parent. I do not need to read one more post from teenage girls who are not sure what rape and sexual abuse are...  My point is this: Kids are growing up WAY too fast. There was a story on the news a few weeks ago about two 6th grade children having sex IN THE CLASSROOM...WHEN THE TEACHER WAS IN THE ROOM!! If that is not enough to wake up ANY parent, I don't know what will.    I taught my son from a very young age, 4 or 5, that no one is allowed to touch him without his permission. As he grew older, I taught him about his responsibility to respect the boundaries of anyone else, and the fact that NO MEANS NO. I also made it crystal clear that if he needed condoms, I would supply them no questions asked (if he was in a relationship). Kids are going to do what they want to do, and I'd rather give him condoms, than have a 14-year-old father in the house. The day he turned 18, even though he was still living with me, I told him that he was on his own.  To this day, I still have a completely open relationship with him. He was no longer a virgin at 19...and I was proud of his choices, but the stories he told me about the casual nature of sex in his high school, blew me away. I may not have done the most popular thing with his upbringing, but I taught him respect for himself and others. He could have had sex when he was 14, and I would have accepted it, but he said the combination of respect for his girlfriend {who was NOT a virgin when they met (bad first experience)} and the fear of STDs and pregnancy, were enough to convince him that he was not ready.    These are some VERY hard truths to hear, but just watch ONE episode of "To Catch a Predator" on dateline, and make an argument that this is the wrong approach!...GL, and hope this helps...Kes    P.S. I had sex for the first time when I was 14, these days, I probably would have been 11...     Does ANY of this sound familiar to you? Now, I don't expect ANYONE to agree with the decisions I made...but my son is a gentleman, respects himself, his friends and his girlfriend. Would you rather see him as a future stepson? Parenting is the most important thing you will do in your life, and to be honest, you have failed your daughter. She learned about love and sex from friends, movies, and popular culture. You were a non-factor in her becoming a woman, and now, it's too late. If you started talking to her NOW about sex and her behavior, she would probably start laughing. In her mind, she is a WOMAN now...not a princess.    You have asked this same question over and over and the reason is: you want a different answer. You want someone to tell you that it was all out of your control and you cannot control "kids these days". You are not going to get a supportive answer here, no matter how many times you ask. I'm sure she is on the pill by now (or you would be a grandmother), and if you decide to crack the whip and take away her freedoms, she will hate you for the rest of your life.  What you need to do is sit down, lay out the facts and ask her if she is on the pill, explain what the rules are in your house (about sex, etc.) and ask her if there is anything she needs. Also, if it hasn't happened, get her a gyno appontment, to make sure all is well.    You are in the same boat as a LOT of other parents who decided not to take an active role in your daughters life...but right now...you need to salvage what you can. You've been an absentee parent...all you have left is to do EVERYTHING you can to let her know that from this moment on, you will be there for her...and do what you can to make her safe. Just remember, if y|`|DlvVvckcaa	Restrict her time with the boyfriend or stop allowing her to see him altogether.  Take away privileges she likes, such as TV time or hanging out with her friends outside of home.  Parents like this make me so angry because when I was 17 I never would have done any of those things, I never caused my parents or any teachers any trouble, but my father STILL did not allow me to have a boyfriend!  He would have put a belt to my a.s.s. if he had ever found out I was doing that stuff at that age!  He didn't even want my mother to let me shop from her Victoria's Secret catalogue even though I only wanted to get the granny panties.   I saved up my money ever since I got my first job at 16 so I could get the hell out of their house.  Your daughter doesn't know how good she's got it and you're treating her like an adult when she's not one yet.   It's time to crack the whip and start realizing your daughter is not a "little princess" she needs some serious discipline NOW.|`|e24701ab1b9a8244e68786fc369da3c2aa	Ahh this sounds pretty normal to me. maybe you should ask if she is on the pill? Why did you leave it untill now, to have to talk to your daughter? part of parenting is to guide them in the right direction in the first place.  How do you know what bra (victoria secret) she wore?  You seem to be very focused on both of their looks (weird)  What makes someone a princess? (how she looks)  I think you are a very immature stupid mother|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	ok. we get that ur daughter is pretty. thats not the most important thing in the world.  sounds to me like she is rebelling.  consider this:she doesnt like being ur "little princess".  talk 2 ur kids about the sex thing. then, let them be normal 17 year olds. good luck.|`|aflW9Y2iaa	tough situation. try showing her what u just wrote on here. i think that maybe if she read this, then she might back off a bit and realize that she is moving too fast. talking helps a lot, but sometimes seeing things written out is more effective. if i was her and i read this, i would realize what i have been doing and how i would sound like a **** and i would want to change. hopefully she is like me and she will slow down a bit. i can tell u that no matter how well u know her, she is not just a little princess. high school is very different now. im a sophomore in high school. there r no one that even comes close to a perfect little angel or princess. im sorry to say, but she isnt as innocent as u think. just show her what u wrote down and talk to her. tell her how this makes u feel and explain to her that she needs to be careful of what she does because it could ruin her future. remind her that most guys would perfer to marry a virgin. i hope i helped u. good luck.|`|tYhFcuZLaa	i'd say that the age of innocence is past for your daughter. I'm not sure what state you are in or what your age of consent is, but it's normal. The fact that they had being dating for this long and you haven't suspected anything else until the BF's mom called makes you suspect. At the age she is at, it's expected. But a sit down and maybe a talk about birth control is probably all you can do. If she hide it from you this long, any open comfrontation is only gonna make her wonder who is talking and you won't stop it, only drive it deeper and strain the relationship of you and your daughter. Atleast have it in your mind that she was with the same guy for 3 years, and she isn't making dumb choice like getting drunk being mishandled.|`|9fTzCUdHaa	Your daughter is pretty much old enough to do what she wants.  Get her on birth control ASAP.  You're going to have to suck it up and just talk to her -- that's your job as mom.|`|VePBcVkJaa	First thing....she is 17 and they have been going out for three years! "Helloooo" this is the age where they will be experimenting and or having sex...what you need to do is talk to her and find out ifshe is using precaution. You need to take her to a gynecologist and discuss birth control. As for having sexin her BF'shouse...that is up to his mom to stop him from that behaviour in her home! All doorsshould be open while they are in his bedroom or any closed off area. Your daughter should be told to respect herself and refrain from public displays of sexuality...she should be more mature than that at17. The pwerson that you need to talk to is HER!! Not your husband....Wishing you luck....no one ever said it was easy .....and it's not.|`|3k0uO9fvaa	You need to cut the umbilical cord.  Your opinion of your daughter is blinded by a mother's need to have a perfect child.  She may be rebelling against you because of it.  As much as we don't want our kids to do make bad choices... the choices are still their's to make and we just have to hope we taught them well enough.  Talk to your daughter but don't ask her to be perfect and don't live vicariously through her.  She is human like you and the older she gets the more you need to treat her like an adult.|`|f1676013c394e922467ee68fa576beefaa	I would certainly hope that her b/f defends her if someone calls her inappropriate names.    If you get mad at her she will only rebel more. Try to have a mature conversation about it, telling her that you do not approve of her behavior, but you realize she is almost an adult. Make sure she understands how easy it can be to get pregnant and make sure she and her b/f are being careful. You could also offer to take her to the Gyn for the first time to have an exam and allow her to talk in private with her doctor about birth control.    Above all, do not yell or get angry with her. Just do what you can to make sure she knows you love her and just want to keep her safe and happy.

It sounds like he is emotionally unstable, which could lead to abuse. It sounds like your friend Matt is a very good friend to you.|`|JgF0DCrbaa	Decide who you like better and go for it.|`|e9c36ca0f2730115ae65696edbc5fb42aa	Wow, you are one DESPERATE girl. I think you should take a break.|`|2b5851c89b00b5acae6e7242a1fd8b55aa	That story was confusing enough.  You need to figure out who you truly like, tell that person, and stick with it.  Dating and relationships take time...some people dont seem to understand that TIME can mean MONTHS.
1Wc2cnifaa	Unless he is a total asshole (in which case your affections for him are totally unjustified), he will react like most guys: flattered and a little surprised.  Give him a few moments to get over the surprise first.  Just walk up to him and go "Hey, would you like to go to the prom with me?".  Straightforward works best with guys.  Oh, and don't bring girlfriends with you when you go =p    Have fun at the prom =]|`|TnGGLz6aaa	yo I dont know much bout this subject, but go for it, just start by finding something in common to talk about, u said your friends on face book gotta be something on there u can talk about that u have in common just take it from there|`|bHxF4brbaa	Just do it if you dont you will regret it high school is such a small part of your life even though right now it doesnt feel like it. Just ask him the worst he can say is no. Just start up a conversation like, Are you excited for prom? Who are you going with? Oh really well maybe we could go together. Hope that helps good luck and have fun dont forget to be safe too!!|`|bEQZu7qhaa	just be like hey wht you doing are you going to prom if he says yes say with who if he says no one ask him|`|xthHLGpvaa	I would say stay out of the porn!    That industry will just eat you up and spit you out ... or swallow|`|6M06Zoh0aa	definately go for it.   you should compliment him and then strike up a conversation.
vF8kRt1aaa	No,you're not clingy.If this is the first time,then you shouldn't make a big deal out of it-after all,he doesn't spend all his time with his brother.If what you just described goes on all the time,I am surprised you still call him your boyfriend.Either way,tell him you feel that you need to spend more time together.Ask him to include you in stuff that he does-like taking you along when he goes to play tennis.Take some time off on a weekend and go somewhere  you two will be alone.|`|AA12083769	he obviously clearly does not really have to worry about having QT with you because you have always let him be this way and he thinks thats ok!!!    its not really a big thing for him to bring his mates along to him, but to you it is, and i can clearly see why, i had the same prob with my boyfriend and once i had told him how i felt he tried being different but then it went back to normal.    in the end it got to much, he got really selfish and always wanted to do his own thing, so i left him for three months and he is a completly different guy now. good luck, dont let him always have it his way. and if he dont change then do your own thing and he will soon realise your not around as much as you used to be...|`|uJi45Rnwaa	Okay, so you're not living with him, then you sound clingy.|`|zoV8xN2Oaa	yes. give him some space. or else he will go mad and eventually dump you.|`|INnIV58vaa	babes well give him some space nd den..............c he will really b in ur way nd dear let me tell u one more thing dat if his brother nd someone else want to come den dont b annoyed just go with them nd mix  up ur self with them it will b gr8 fun trust me..............|`|WVhYsZ2Yaa	No your not being clingy at all...you just want to see and be with him; and there's nothing wrong with that. Your bf has good reasons for being occupied though and you are giving him his space to keep his life on track. He seems like a good bf. He listened to you and did what you said..(getting in touch with you more often, through messages) but still he should make some time just for the two you on the weekends! The Sunday on the beach thing sounds very cool..but if he wants to bring his brother and friend along, i think this time you should let him and just go have some fun! But after the days end you two need to talk about where your relationship stands.. cause you two need more time with each other if you want this relationship to progress... otherwise he will see no difference between a friend and a girlfriend!|`|POUQB8qQaa	Ofcourse u r not. Everybody be it a boy or a girl, wants to spend his or her own time with their love. and u r doing that only.
fANHH71Vaa	Yes you can.   Live happily, Love another guy and let him love you too.|`|IDBQxWoFaa	It takes TIME... and lots of it! (but it seems as u aren't really over your ex)|`|tGMJMmngaa	find new man|`|IogYiz1maa	You can't... Once you love someone you always have a place in your heart for them no matter what you try to do.... 10 years along the line you will still feel the same if their names ever come up.....
QdnH6oyMaa	very immature reaction {}|`|LejhCxWraa	Yup I would say you overreacted.|`|gH4NNyBZaa	errr , yes you r.  you were just getting a bit jealous and tend to be angry..  he's your crush and of cos will get jealous..  nothing much..    so (:|`|E5Oxk2exaa	no coz u did have a crush on him at first then you found out he likes some1 else to so its understandable that you were upset but your over him now so thats ok go look for some1 else : )
rXd6FzdCaa	He probably just likes you enough to be protective of you.  There may be some attraction even though he has a girlfriend.  That doesn't necessarily mean he wants to be with you instead just that there may be some feelings.|`|XJq2fUkyaa	It sounds to me like he might be interested in you in one way or another, but his behavior and controling attitude needs to be avoided at all costs.|`|FVzURSU5aa	He sounds like a complete girly beeeaatch.  Sounds more like girl behavour than a guy.    Is there a possibility he likes you and he is acting out some feelings of resentment.    Often guys are best able to express anger and nastiness when they are rejected or 'not chosen' rather than just be honest and upfront.    My guess is that he likes you!|`|67e285f67100a33f39023a4cf0b564feaa	maybe he's interested. i don't know. but since you're not, you don't have to explain to him who you are or you are not sleeping with/kissing.  it's just none of his business.
Jbr1UquLaa	For me, 10 years is a big difference. I think the maximum (at least right now in my life) would be 5 years older than me.|`|jwhvF0A8aa	YES with exception to rich old *******|`|f7ccf6d84ba911583ae3de3b436047deaa	for me 10  years is a big difference  but thats just my opinion its all up 2 u?

What matters most is that you each respect and trust each other,  have open communication, and a connection.|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	I personally would like to date who ever is mature and who likes me. If they reciprocate the interest why not? I mean, for example, if I was to go out with someone who was 33, I wouldn't mind. It's a bit much but if we click, we click.|`|lAA1ZoXCaa	I am currently engaged to a wonderful man, who happens to be 10 years older than myself.  I have dated guys my age, men up to 12 years older and guys younger than I am - though ten years younger would be extreme - I'm 29.    I have to say, it all depends on the individuals involved.  My younger exes were energetic, spontaneous and fun, but lacked the stability I need.  The man I am with now isn't quite as into partying, but then neither am I anymore.  The things we have in common now are far more lasting.  I share more with him in tastes than I ever have with anyone - and that is fantastic.    Like I said, it is all up to the two individuals involved.

yc5z7MKbaa	you're in the difficult situation  i think your in love but be sure of your feelings and also you need to know what he feel for you. for me theres nothing wrong to fall from your best friend but you need to know what he feels to avoid hurt feelings.|`|KazQgOL2aa	that's sweet!! you are in love w/t him|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	your in love with him    no way around it      find out if he feels the same way|`|bCM8Fu6iaa	WTF,, ahihihihi
CnuwupbOaa	I don't think it would affect anything, unless he's really considering intimacy with you, and that's where it's not legal. It also depends on how mature he is; is he able to put up with the age difference? It's only one year difference from what he believes you are, so it shouldn't have any affect on the relationship.|`|5Hkqd9DVaa	I did the same thing to my ex. He thought I was a year older then I was... but then I told him after we'd been going out for three weeks and he was fine with it. Just tell him sooner rather then later and you'll be fine!  :)|`|TpedyP6caa	Should tell him now.  If he finds out later, he might be pissed of at you.  Besides, his age is an important factor too.
m6SEpm8Yaa	He has to know how to make her laugh at herself sometimes.Or know when to hold her in his arms and let her cry.Or when to merly smile and leave her to herself.He also needs to be himself...the perfect guy can not be described....you merly know when he looks at you and takes your hand that he is going to be the one.      And one thing for me that I think is amazzing is if a guy has a English accent.But I think I can work around that.|`|730e9fe4e038fd0e4cdc9f8ec01b4ee2aa	Sense of humour.. that's a BIG one!!|`|GDS79pcuaa	Respect, Honesty and why not...

And if you like us don't get a friend to ask us for you that's just rude and immature. You have to be a gentlemen (open doors, pull out chairs, etc). Don't be something your not. Good luck =]

w8WDKLg4aa	I got married very young and the guy just got very controlling and didn't respect me at all.  He didn't let me do things that I cared about and it didn't take me long to rrealize that he was not the good guy I thought he was.      So once I got out of that horrible mess, I did several things.    1)  Got involved again in all the things that I am passionate about that he wouldn't let me do.    2)  Listened and sang along (to the top of my lungs) with lots of powerful songs by my favorite singers and bands (most of whom he wouldn't let me listen to when we were on a trip.)    3)  I got back to church and trying to live the way I should  (he didn't want to go to church with me - ever.  And he made fun of inspirational things that my Mom would send me to boost me up - yeah he was awesome!)    4)  Found a gorgeous/fun/fantastic/witty    guy to date and realized that not all guys are bad.    5)  Married the gorgeous/fun/fantastic/witty    guy, moved far away, and had his two beautiful babies.    6)  I still laugh about how stupid I was to be so convinced that he was the right guy for me and that I married him when I was just 19.

lqj6NYRlaa	Is there any place special to you that you have told her about in your online interactions? That would be kinda romantic! It would make your relationship more real, since you haven't seen each other in person before.    PS - don't listen to the people that will tell you that you can't fall in love online. My brother met his wife online, they met once in person before getting married. They've been VERY happily married now for 3.5 years and are trying for their first baby! In fact, I've never seen anyone more happy in their marriage!|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Well, if you think you're in love with her, you must know what her likes and dislikes are, what some of her passions are, what kind of things she enjoys doing, etc.  There must be things you two have in common as far as things or places you both like.  Figure that out and then consider what your area (I'm assuming she lives in your general area or is coming to visit you) offers in the way of those likeable things.  A nice, not real expensive or fancy restaurant where there is food you both like and can sit talking (for a long time without having to buy more food) would be good, not overly romantic (yet)--just a nice, clean, unhurried place.  If you like the outdoors and the weather is willing, plan a picnic or a walk in a populated park (where there are people around so no one starts to feel too at risk).  I'd not suggest a movie since it's almost 2 hours when you can't talk or look or do much with each other.  The first meeting should be not too extensive, that is, a couple hours is fine for a first time, just to actually meet each other and get a chance to talk face-to-face.  Sometimes too much time together is not a good idea because you don't get a chance to digest and it can get too intense (and then you start blowing it).  Take it slow.  If she is the rightest right one, there will be other, longer, even better dates in the future.|`|746169a998fa1f38584855dac63adc97aa	STARBUCKS|`|5d73b153670425c028538ee2a612fa54aa	i would say to ask her, that way you dont take her somewhere someone else suggests and she has a totaly horrible time|`|VWou8mabaa	Congratulations. Take her to a public place where you can talk and get to know each other on a personal level. It will make her feel safe to have other people close by. Good luck!|`|F0mL86Vtaa	Take her somewhere quiet for dinner where you can talk.  Is there a romantic place nearby where you can stroll afterwards, perhaps stop for a drink?  Don't do a concert or a movie...you've waited 9 months to enjoy each others' company!  Congrats and good luck to you.|`|k0bKnTJQaa	Take her to a romantic candle lit dinner prepared by you or a restaurant. A picnic on the beach and then a walk afterword. Us women aren't hard to please, just treat us right, and then you have us eating out of the palms of your hands.|`|5fb726ed5bae8c2623098c8502941e5daa	dinner and a movie maybe?|`|UM97yJRLaa	"fell in love on line".....LOL|`|aaXT3HXNaa	Strip Joint|`|q1W9JF1iaa	Or the beach.. (If you live on the coast)|`|bQj3zOdEaa	Congrats!  I met my husband online (Match.com).  As far as the nice place, what are your limits?  State?  Country?  World?...and where are you?|`|UZNksQKraa	mmm well i think that a nice coffee shop its the best place to meet someone.|`|AA12129847	I met my hubby on-line! ON match.com...  Anyhow, we met at a resturant on the San Clemente Pier. After we were done eating, we enjoyed time on the sand. Since we knew each other so well (b/c we chatted so much on the computer and the phone) we had lots to talk about.  Oh, Good Luck to you.  I know you will be just fine. After all, you have already know her, after nine months!|`|KqMzubmPaa	well baby me and you will be just fine as long as we are next to eachother,,,,i love you baby   and i love all these answers you have gotten on this ?|`|0u5T1uBgaa	Start out at a nice public place like a coffee shop. Then let her decide whre she would like to go from there.|`|F9sHGd5daa	i say a public place, somewhere, where she'll feel safe, and does she know that you love her?!|`|806d11849b4fd6fed6f1f3bd495885e5aa	somewhere romantic, a nice lunch on the waterfront, a hand in hand stroll in the park and bring a small bunch of flowers. Have fun and good luck!!   :>)|`|z4M5JBVNaa	I would suggest that you both go to place were both of you will enjoy, have the time for each other, and please talk to one another. A date that is a non talk and just staring is boring...   Or you can go to a place where both of you like.     Enjoy  and Talk to one another. Good luck!|`|dWxSAXpCaa	I'd go with the first reply, dinner and a movie, or something of that nature.  Despite "knowing" her online for the past 9 months (oddly, that's also the gestation period for a human female), you don't really know her as she really is in reality, and you cannot truly love someone that you don't yet truly know.  Take it slow and be cautious, just as one should in a completely reality based relationship.  If you're lucky, your relationship will transition smoothly from online to reality.

Eso quiere decir que estaba jugando con tus sentimientos. Pero tu ya tienes tu familia y eso es lo que cuenta. Si el no quiere aceptar tu condicin pues hechalo para un lado y sigue feliz con tu vida.

PyIKEoxlaa	Pues yo he hecho eso; y no te llena, es decir, una persona que te enriquece, te hace sentir valorada y todo, es muy bonito; y puede que le agarres el gusto fisicamente; pero yo creo que realmente la diferencia entre un amigo y un novio, es precisamente la atraccin. Y es difcil que sientas esa pasin y locura que se siente cuando es alguien que te encanta fisicamente.|`|6qFtEAQuaa	el fsico es importante, si alguien te gusta empiezas acercandote, eso no lo haces con los que no te son agrables a la vista, ahora bien, una relacin perdura sin importar el fsico, lo que cautiva es la esencia de la persona, su inteligencia, sentido del humor, sentimientos, actitud, personalidad.|`|4W1UD3Dmaa	Bueno el fsico es lo de menos si ya te gusta el interior lo exterior es lo de menos.|`|rJkD0alnaa	DALE, QUIEN SABE SI ES CHICLE Y PEGA.

Creo q algo importa el fisico....(aunque muchos digan q no) suerte...espero q te sirva..|`|4GcAZg02aa	Depende que es lo que buscas en esa relacin. Si buscas sexo y placer, yo creo que no, si es una parte muy importante de tu vida sexual el ver a la persona, pues no.  Me imagino que eres una chica muy jove, por eso estas tan fijada en la apariencia, contaminada por la  publicidad cultural que nos vende como debe verse la gente "nice".  Pero a fin de cuentas lo importante es alguien que te respete, te cuide, se preocupe por ti, ahora y para siempre. Que tenga detalles, que sea un amor contigo.  Bye y buena suerte.  Recuerda la bellezase acaba muy pronto pero el amor verdadero es para siempre.|`|8f944d1221ec1508597774363f85160caa	Bueno, logicamente, siempre vemos el cascaron primero. Pero en verdad te digo que el cascaron no es tan importante como lo que esta adentro, ponte en el lado de el, si tu fueras poco fea y nadie te hiciera caso por eso, tu te dirias, "Porque ? si yo soy una persona linda por dentro" . Bueno yo diria que si quieres que te tranten increiblemente bien sin el WOW, vota por el nino no tan atractivo ( pueda que al pasar de el tiempo el se ponga mas atractivo. El hombre guapo tiende ser vanidoso y volado y al fin de cuentas el cascaron de qiebra.|`|DE3E8y4vaa	hola, pues mira me toco andar con un chico que no era muy guapo, pero fue lo que creo llaman amor a primera vista, yo ya tena novio pero apesar de que ese chico no era tan simpatico fisicamente lo que me enloquecio fue que le encantaban las mismas cosas que a mi y nos conectamos muy muy bien y la relacin se dio rapidisimo, pero terminamos por que mis amigas insistian que el amor era ciego pero que yo exageraba, no paso mas de ahi pero si sientes ese clik, en las miradas los abrazos, ya para el beso que creo es lo que te aterroriza ya no hay problem, por que la qumica es lo que cuenta, osea para que quieres un super tipo si no te sabe sentir bien, vamos no hay otra cosa ms que t misma tengas t anecdota intentalo y sabras.   suerte !|`|d45bca1e32129568be1b83acafd01d1caa	Pues mira, lo importante lo determinas tu, y nadie mas que tu?  Creo que tu misma te deberias de preguntar si te importa o no el fisico, mira yo tengo amigos gordos con mujeres muy hermosas y amigas no muy dotadas con amigos galanes, pero eso es cuetin suya, tal vez ellos y ellas se enamoraron de su forma de ser y no les impota el fisco. No se tu edad, pero mira si para ti es importante el fisico pues sigue buscando un chico que te llene, porque de nada va ha servir que te des una oportunidad.   Pero si crees que con el paso del tiempo esto no importara pues adelante.  Para mi el fisico si es algo importante, ya que no solo es por estetica si no tambien por salud. Mira, como te dije cada persona sabe los que es importante y lo que no, as que esta, si a ti te importa el fisico esta bien, ademas como dices que te pas, si alguien esta hermoso pero es un patan tarde que temprano te vas a fastidiar y lo vas a dejar.    Pero bueno ya te di mucho choro, lo que importa es que tu te estes bien y agusto, si con este chico te la pasa bien, pues dale una oportunidad y date una oportunidad tu.    Suerte.|`|4m5YM4d3aa	Yo no soy guapo, soy varonil, as que puedo hablar por los que no somos como tu ex-patn.

La pelicula es "Amadeus" y es lo que le refiere una cantante de pera a Saliri en relacin a Mozart, cuando le pregunta ella "y..., como es?".     En realidad, el fsico puede deslumbrarte, pero crees que lo que lleva por fuera es lo mismo que lo de adentro???|`|iwEDnZzNaa	El fisico no lo es todo, pero te debes de dar la oportunidad con esa persona|`|bpNDemBJaa	mira amino me importa mucho el fisico si no q me respete y me quiera x lo q soy  no x lo q rengo|`|GXw9gwFGaa	hola mira no pierdes nada intentalo lo fisico sale sobrando por q cuando estan muy caritas nos ponen los cuernos y si este chavo te trata bien pues intenbtalo no pierdas la oportunidad para q quieres a alguien guapo si no teva a respetar lo fisico no dura toda la vida|`|owf9R8c7aa	hay amiga mira la verdad hace poco hice una pregunta acerca de la forma fisica.  pero bueno no mas una contesto que si las demas dicen que los buenos sentimientos etc. esta bien lo reconosco el amor es primero pero la vista es el inicio del amor y despues lo demas.  pero ami aparte que me descuide un poco mi fisica por la escuela y trabajo entonces de mis piernas no como jugaba entre semana y domingos mis pies estan fuertes pero de mi abdomen pues si engorde un poco y me faltaba un poco de pecho y brazo pero poco a poco lo voy a recuperar por ya termine la escuela y puedo ir en la tarde al GYM para mejorar y estar mejor y la verdad muchas chicas me hablan y me buscan por que ya me veo mejor mas delgado y con un fisica marcado que es lo que quiero la verdad si es mejor estar fisicamente pero como quieras tu decides lo mejor para ti cuidate ok.|`|47a3739af08587ebc639f26335158075aa	Todo tiene que ver con todo,suele suceder que ejemplo trabajando viendote todos los das puedes realmente enamorarte de alguien que si lo vieras una sola vez no le darias ni la hora, pero tampoco sirve que solo sea lindo , es un complemento , este que te dice cosas lindas por ahi tambien es una porqueria, sino te gusta no debes salir, ya llegara el que complete el curriculum, no descartes, tenlo de amigo conocelo y ve que pasa pero si no te atrae queda amigo y punto, tampoco es solo sexo eso muere con el tiempo, es un 50 y un 50 que te lleves y atraiga sino no va.

Desgraciadamente an dependemos de nuestros padres, porque con tu sueldo no creo que puedas mantenerte por mucho tiempo. Mejor chale ganas al estudio para algn da poder lograr esa independencia que tanto anhelas...    O consguete un novio rico!!! jajaja No te creas..|`|N1rRN2NJaa	a mi me parees muy bien que te independices, yo lo hice cuando tenia tu edad,, pero si te digo algo no hay como la casa de los viejos, es mucha responsabilidad vivir sola|`|o7oZUr6Faa	Con ese dinero te puedes independizar pero vas a carecer de muchisimas cosas. La neta, no creo que te puedas independizar con esa lana. Y menos si estudias.  Planealo con mas tiempo, junta mas dinero y aumentaras tus probabilidades de exito.    Tienes que considarar que ese trabajo lo puedes perder en cualquier momento y entonces seria peor regresar a tu casa por haber fracasado. Suerte.|`|0ca491c78bded56d87b3fe8feee60125aa	Tu sueldo es en dolares??...  bueno pues si ganas tanto,  puedes muy facilmente independizarte,  ya que si vas a pagar renta,  puedes encontrar un lindo estudio por el cual pagarias unos $ 1,000. dolares aprox.  dependiendo de su ubicacion..  lo otro es ver si ya estas  capacitada lo suficiente como para poder vivir sola,   ten en cuenta  que ya no estaran a tu lado tus padres,  para hacerse cargo de los gastos,   o de tenerte tu ropa  lavadita y planchadita,   y  comida a la mesa...  Ayy!!   no hay como vivir con tus papis cuando aun estas soltera...  yo fui tan feliz con ellos !!!!    byby|`|lbiCz8gvaa	Primero y principal estate segura de que vas a poder sola, con el tema cocina, ropa, afectos, etc.  Puede parecer facil a la distancia, pero seguro cuando tengas q hacer todo vos sola no te va a parecer tanto.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	I think volleyball is an awesome sport of a girl to play because it one of the few sports that they can be competitive at with guys (co-ed volleyball is so fun). Plus if she is really good there are a lot of clubs, teams and other options to keep playing well into college and beyond. Its also a great sport for building teamwork, communication and its a great work out.     Plus nothing is hotter to me then when I get beat on a play by a woman... it just gets me all kinds of excited!     Dan|`|ODblt2gTaa	soccer or tennis|`|64QH0pCnaa	Rugby!!!

If you're in there just to have fun, pick a good drinking sport.  Some that come to mind are softball, bowling and golf.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Having been a full time single dad for a long time the biggest challenge for me was trying to date for fun, but also always keep in mind wether the person I was dating could someday be my son's stepmom. You cross a lot of people off quick when kids come into the picture, but thats a good thing cuz the last thing she'll want to do it date a guy who has no interest in the kids (aside from the occasional booty call if she is the type that needs that).     I tried online dating (eharmony, match.com) to some mixed results, but it helped me get over my ex and prepare me for my new wife. I met her through a friend, but it took almost 5 years of being a single parent until I met her... so patience is also key.     If she is cute, a good mom and the kids are good... she'll have plenty of chances. As her friend just be there to help her make sure she makes wise choices and its always nice to be on the look out for guys you can pair her up with.    Good Luck    Dan|`|tyNmX1Uiaa	Babysit her kids and have her drop me a line. But seriously if U and any of your friends are single,take her out.

A cada obstculo uma surpresa, as vezes estas surpresas s?o desagradveis  Basta saber lidar com esta situa??o e daremos a volta por cima.    As pessoas que passam pelo nosso caminho deixam marcas.  Algumas deixam marcas inesquecveis e agradveis de se lembrar.  E outras deixam marcas de dor e sofrimento, mas  s encar-las de frente.    Superar situa??es  sinal de for?a e coragem.  Mas as vezes come?amos a nos decepcionar sem tentar super-las.  E nos damos por vencidos, mas levante a cabe?a e encare todas elas com justi?a e sabedoria.    As vezes pensamos em desistir de tudo e de todos, e nos entregar de corpo e alma a uma pessoa.  Mas pense bem: Ser que esta pessoa merece todo este sacrifcio?  N?o aja por impulso, sempre pare, pense e reflita, com calma, justi?a e sabedoria.    N?o deixe de lutar pelos seus ideais e por tudo aquilo que voc acha que  o certo a fazer...

wxt2glrYaa	just take it easy  Once you see him, walk towards him and tell him, Hey, did you know I like trumpet too - just wanted you to know so you don't think I am chasing you or anything  that's how you break the ice and get the tension out of it
CnuwupbOaa	I believe the chances of getting back with him are very likely. If he's still complimenting you after the breakup he believes that it's not over yet. He's not over you at all, but he's emotionally smashed and not trying to show you that he's hurt. So, he does the complete opposite and tries to flatter and please you.     It's not clear why you broke up with him, but obviously something wasn't working. I believe it wouldn't work out seeing that you had a semi-falling out once. Surely there will be clarity the second time if there is a second time. His considerate affection feels nice now, but how long do you suppose he can keep the act up? You get back with him and he'll drop the act and be his normal self which you may disagree with.
500f5cf207b839911cca33c8c0eaee7caa	Well first I want to say, that is very sweet of you to consider her feelings instead of taking advantage..     I would suggest you just be honest with her. Just let her know that she is a nice girl but you don't this its going to work because you are not feeling her as much as she is feeling you. Let her know that you want to let her know before you guys go any furthur because you don't want to mislead her in any way. Let her know that you definately enjoyed the time that you spent with her but you prefer to end it or stay friends because you don't want to waste both of your time..     To me, honesty is the best policy. If a guy told me that, I would be a little upset and I would feel like, "whats wrong with me." But I would look at it as you at least being a man and telling me the truth and being honest...|`|UZi7EfQSaa	be honest|`|740df4fc25bd65dff8ce5362efe67075aa	I agree with most of the others. Just be yourself and be honest and tell her being friends is great but you don't see it going any further. Your a great guy for NOT taking advantage of her body and then dumping her. Most guys think with their penis and don't think of the emotional stuff that comes later. It will all work itself out. Your heart is in the right place. Stick to your heart.|`|iIgjg66Laa	Like a band-aid, the quicker the better....a lot of pain for a short time!  Be honest with her.|`|947e8d2a8c93696ba2589cdec8ec38a1aa	just be honest....you dont want to be in this relationship with her so tell her....just be honest!!!|`|AA10962695	Just be honest and tell her, that you are just not that into her and don't want to lead her on.  Tell her that you think she is nice but you just don't see it going anywhere, and leave it at that. Us girls can respect honesty. It may burn for a minute but she'll be fine. Good Luck!|`|twc1I7ZBaa	just be honest and sensetive too. its okay to say that your aren't feeling the same way about her and you don't see this going anywhere.  thats reason enough. be kind and hopefully it works out. i mean its only been a few dates right?
AA10508288	You are the perfect Chinese girl.|`|f418a7ef7c081a4b77cf8c593f969692aa	I am sorry but there is no one who is perfect. But in case you want my opinion of what MAKES an attractive Chinese girl it would be : fair, medium-sized, 5 ft 3 inch, whatever her eyes are like, and black/dark brown haired. No body is perfect, so please remember that.|`|ccoVWsNPaa	each one of them have her own unique ways such as SALLY YEH, KELLY HU( mixed) the list goes on and on...HAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!QLKM!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VCZ9dKJcaa	Umm... what?!!|`|b0525335a5c917ecb2d5a8e0f4744b29aa	Light skin, small eyes, not too small, at least 5 ft. Brown hair, 100-130 lbs. Small waist.|`|VQbKUPnxaa	no thanks.
CnuwupbOaa	Well she got with you three days later. That's too soon to get over any one. You should know that. She got with you to fulfill her emotional needs, it's generally called a rebound guy by those ill-spirited no-moral-having girls.     If it's so easy for you to pin-point your doubt through her actions why would you try to stay with her? She's wrong friends are the best lovers. You have to be friends in the first place for the relationship to be strong. She obviously doesn't know that because her relationships seem to be falling one after the other.|`|25ffd72a5d2814c74d5034b428176242aa	yes she used you to get to him that is awful|`|d1b1061ad9fd09c6983137171141fe43aa	I would have to agree with the others, yes you were used :(  Immature humans tend to do that in relationships to get attention.|`|1s6mg0A2aa	yea she did|`|RGt4lgHEaa	Do Not give her or him the satisfaction of being upset over this. This is a trivial thing in your life, trust me. You do not want to be the guy that she continues to rely on when she wants to get her bf atttention. So if he and she see's that you really could not care less then she just lost all her self importance. meaning you justripped her security blankey right out from under her. Which in turn will cause him to see hmmm she wasn't all that to you so maybe now she's not so desireable to him either. maybe they grow up and get married and live happily ever after but you won't be anyone's crutch. Don't be mad, sad or happy. Just indifferent. move on to the new girl and never once mention the other girl to her. I promise it will drive the one that used you crazy to know you didn't even need the time to get over it. get over what? EXACTLY! Just have some fun and enjoy your youth. it won't last forever.|`|oVuoiEk8aa	LOL...naughty question...    but yo, dat's effed up. she definately used u. the same thing happened wit a friend of mine though. check out these two links i posted. they might be able to help you.|`|AA10530240	people aren't always themselves on rebound dates... so you might have wanted to ask her out a little bit later|`|aJD0rBZ3aa	that girl used u.....i  mean like she wiped her DIRTY hands on you then threw u away ....wut a b****.....that is so mean....im really sry for u but yeah she used u|`|93dacde4a9878921119ea1af2b0ba9a2aa	UM, yeah, I think she was using you to get over her ex, or see if she really still liked him.  But don't take it too hard, you're still young and you gotta realize that feelings are always confusing.  Maybe she didn't really think she was using you.  She could really like you but she just has to realize it and she needs time to be single and clear her mind.  It may take time, or maybe you two are better off as friends.|`|coZaItjjaa	i say yes. unless you guys were already hitting it off and she was planning on dumping him for you, then she was using you. the only reasons girls really date right away after a break up is either they are trying to make their ex jealous or they are just trying to get over their ex. but in your case, she seems like she is still really into him, so i think she was doing it for the jalousy.|`|kyjLTsEmaa	She is probably using you, sorry. Did she say,"I'm thinking about goin' out with Austin again" in front of you?|`|bEQZu7qhaa	i dont wanna be mean but yeah i think she used you sorry|`|aFv9PkBraa	Ya she used you, but theirs other fish in the sea ;)
BS9TcGHOaa	Hola,     Yo si que lo he pensado. Pero por suerte me equivoqu y hoy estoy enamorada y muy feliz.  Cada ruptura se siente como un fracaso, y es lgico ese sentimiento, hay que hacer un duelo. Pero luego se pasa y vuleves a ilusionarte!!!    Suerte!!! y nimo!!!|`|gvSMWVvNaa	NO.|`|tvgfeUVKaa	Yo solo te puedo decir una cosa, el amor esta en todas partes, solo hay que ser sincero, saber lo que quieres y lo que estas dispuesto a dar y recibir,Todos queremos lo mismo amar y ser amados. (aunque siempre hay excepciones) si buscas amor o amistad sincero y estas dispuesto a dar lo mismo. No lo dudes el amor esta en todas partes.|`|a4c0dc4e10e942fdff3c3c0170d83d4faa	De echo si, hasta da miedo conocer o salir con alguien.|`|12d1e04c66b33c41e0ef59637ca15232aa	No seas pesimista, algundia encontraras al amor de tu vida!!!!!! Aqui estoy para lo que quieras!!!!!|`|lom2mvLiaa	S, lo pens, pero luego me di cuenta de que eso no sirve, no hay que ser negativo, todo llegar. Adems hay que disfrutar la vida.|`|CwjW56fXaa	pues hay veces que si, pero despues encuentras a otra persona de la cual te enamoras y asi hasta que encuentres a la persona perfecta|`|i9PfjsoHaa	Nop! A pesar de los pesares me dije: tiene que haber alguien correcto que s me quiera, valore y respete y visceversa.    Me negu a cerrarle las puertas y ventanas al amor y a dejar que las experiencias desagradables entorpecieran encontrar el amor.    Sabes algo, creo que hoy, unos a?os mas tarde, puedo decir que ha dado resultado y desde hace tiempo tengo una bella relacion estable.    A veces solo hay que darle tiempo al tiempo.    Saludos!|`|e93b917a098400b4e1b1cac8d9b4fd75aa	si.. pero despues se te pasa (aunque en ese momento pienses que no.) y cuando ni lo esperas ya te enomaras de otra persona..|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Creo que mas de una vez me ha pasado pensar que no voy a volver a enamorarme, pero al final solo es cuestion de tiempo y creo que es una de tantas cosas en la vida las cuales realmente no podemos controlar asi que lo unico que nos queda es tener paciencia, vivir la vida al maximo y si el amor debe llegar pues llegara|`|0ca491c78bded56d87b3fe8feee60125aa	Solia pensar eso... pero despues de algunos tropiezos,  y de haber pensado que el amor  no  volveria a llegar,  llego..    Asi es que nunca se deben de perder las esperanzas,  pues el amor es el sentimiento que mas mueve a los humanos..    Adiosito...

ieoACSmjaa	Well something similar happened to me in highschool. I really liked this guy and I knew he really liked me. It was homecoming time and I really hoping that he would ask me. Well I found out that my locker mate which was also my friend had a huge crush on him. He came up to me one day and told me that he really wanted to ask me to go but we agreed that it would be best if he took her. We didn't want to hurt her. In the end we never ended up dating. By the time she was over him he was into someone else. I was hurt at first, then realized there was a reason why we were never meant to date. We would have made a great couple. But had we dated then I never would have met my current man. We have been together now for 10 yrs!!! At the time I would have met him I would have been with my friends crush.  So don't sweat it. Who knows....Her date may not work out and you could still have a chance. If you do don't hesitate to ask her out!!!  Good luck sweetie!!|`|DWHj3TVJaa	Dude its one date so they probably arent going to start dating right away so if you really like this girl i suggest you bite this problem(other dude) in the butt not fighting or anything but ask her out ASAP and just tell her you would like to take her out on a date before she decides to date some other guy......make it happen|`|4ySxlGQXaa	Trust me I had The Same Feeling With A girl named Lana but this is what i told her i said      lana I have felings for you okay and even though you may like this guy i really like you      and before you know it me and her are going out hope this helps do the roght thing man i know you got it in you homie|`|65ec846f996d9a1bd24cbb7ca4b79014aa	You aren't out of luck just because she is going on a date! Step up to the plate boy! Ask her out for another night and show her a good time. Be confident in yourself!|`|9PWQ4YJKaa	MAN! I can't believe it the same exact thing happened to me today, I asked her out and then I found out that she already had a boyfriend, Well the only way to deal with it it's that you let her go with him, Unless they are not bf and gf  yet then yeah give it another shot but if she makes him her boyfriend then there's nothing you can do but move on!|`|4bbc1c1637c6411b28fbe14806e4c159aa	Well if they are just going out on a date, whose to say that they will hit it off??  You still have a chance.  Ask her out, what do you have to lose??? take care|`|56jmbAIOaa	you respect her feelings and be happy for her.    however,dating someone does not mean that you are intimately involved with them so you can stop jumping a head of yourself.    the only sure way is to ask her if she is involved with anyone then make the next move.  all the best

pT0pSsqmaa	I don't know what happened to a lot of girls either. I'm not like that at all (I'm 15), I still believe in sex after marriage etc etc and making out with each other is really gross if you ask me!! lol. This behavior is NOT acceptable, but more and more parents seem not to know exactly what their children are doing anymore, nonetheless, where they are. Parents need to be more strict and stop giving in to their spoiled children. Yea, they may get extremely ticked off like I do - my parents are very strict - but I rather them be strict and piss me off now and then, than losing all inhibitions and respect for myself. If you find the answer to the cause of this, please let me know!

So just as men can drink, so can girls.  Just as men can be promiscuous, so can girls.    Now, not every girl believed this or does now.  But this mentality seeped into the culture and gives us what we now have.  I'm not at all surprised when I see studies that show girls being bigger binge-drinkers than males or that girls are more promiscuous than every.    But girls and boys are absolutely, fundamentally different.  So when I hear about girls' promiscuity I'm not at all surprised to hear that female suicide and depression rates are at an all time high.    Good work, feminists!    As it turns out, I find girls who are chaste, modest, and more reserved a whole lot sexier than the whores you see on many college campuses and in the media.  And I don't think I'm alone.|`|8Hh6CDEWaa	40% of all sites visited are to porn.

It's because of stupid societal bullshit that girls have all these qualms about sex.     But recently, girls are becoming more in touch with their sexuality (which is great!) and actually most guys aren't in touch with their sexuality. They are horny, but aren't sexual -- if that makes sense.    My prognosis, is that you are frustrated that girls are 'easy' or some such BS, because you aren't the one having sex with them.    YOU are the reason girls had to deal with this total repression. You and your fucked up ideals about sex.    Repression = Fixation.
Z3kgu0OHaa	The most important thing is to get him to work a steady job. He's being difficult because when no one bosses him around at work, he's going to start thinking he's boss. So reasoning with him won't work unless you have an upper hand and let him know you mean business, if you don't he'll just keep pushing the envelope. The last thing you want is to keep is a relationship that doesn't work - it means more than just a good heart (the road to hell is paved with good intentions).     Quick action is required or else your indecisiveness and passivity will only give him the perception that what he's doing is acceptable - which is NOT!    (More importantly, find out why he quit his last job or why he was let go from his work place. Call his manager and find out why. If he can't find a job, help him correct his mistake or work on what he needs to improve on.)    You can only improve yourself.

HcoFcYWzaa	For me 19 was not a great time for relationships, i found myself and my partners to be very jealous at that age, to feel every emotion too intensely, always over reacting over stupid things, although there are some good points but those are mainly sex related and in the grand scheme of things really not that important,  if i had my time there again i would have waited, i truly wish that i had saved myself for Mr Right on my wedding night, seriously, you have your whole life yet to do the complicated relationship stuff, concentrate on your studies work hard, get the career the car whatever and finding a girl then will be a piece of cake, because sadly there are not many woman these days in or out of work that want a guy with no prospects for a long term thing and why should she if she plans on having a long term relationship? possibly children, it is almost the rules these days, so yes enjoy being single it is alot less complicated lol.|`|hadyf7E7aa	OH BOY,  HONESTLY WAIT.

Bisa terjadi seorang anak tidak menyukai orang tuanya.  Tetapi kita harus fair, sepanjang orang tua kita tidak melakukan tindakan kriminil, saya kira kita tidak perlu berlebihan membenci mereka.  Mungkin cara komunikasi antara anak dan orang tua yg harus berubah, dalam arti masing-2 respek dan saling menghormati.      Ulet Bulu juga sudeh jelaskan, bahwa anda sudah terang kepada ayah anda, bahwa anda tidak suka diperlakukan seperti itu, tetapi toch ayah anda tidak berubah.  Mengapa begitu?, saya tidak tahu mengapa ayah anda begitu.    Saya punya advis yg kira-kira bisa menolong ulet bulu ;    - hindari percakapan/kontak yg menurut anda hanya akan      memancing kebencian anda semangkin menjadi-jadi.    - kalau ulet bulu sekarang sudah dapat berdiri sendiri, ka    rena sudah bekerja dsb, usahakan keluar dari rumah ;       dengan demikian mungkin kontra akan sedikit mereda.

569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	He probably was a creep.    Either that or he didn't know say.    Or, maybe he was trying to mesmerize you with his eyes. It was working at first because you were flattered, right? So, he just didn't know when to quit while he was ahead.    But some fools think they can actually hypnotize girls by staring into their eyes long enough. Maybe he was trying to do that.    Or even worse, he may have been some nut that thought he some sort of psychic powers. Maybe if you had stared back long enough, you would've got the "message". I don't know. Wear shades.    -------------------    If he does that, then he definitely likes you but is afraid to make the first move because like everyone else has already said, he just doesn't know what to say or do.    Why don't you approach him and ask him, "Why do you stare into my eyes the way you do?" And if he can't explain, ask him for his phone number and tell him you would like to talk to him about it later. That is, if you think he's cute and not a nut. lol.|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	he likes you! he is 2 nervous 2 talk to you. so, talk to him! make a move!|`|AtYYa1Zyaa	YOU HAVE TO CATCH AN ATTiTUDE WiTH HiM AND BE LiKE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKiNG AT?!?!

Why? Because whether your good or bad inside, whether she'll like you or not, at lease she will love you for who you really is. Maybe, just do what you normally do before. Ask her what makes she thinks that you've somehow changed. Then, explain what you feels about it. If she is not convinced, show her. If she really know you, she'll understand. At the end, respecting one another's decision matters. Show your love, but never expect for anything in return because that is what true love means.    Smile, God Loves You! c",)

The best advice i can give you is if you feel splitting up is the way to go to make you feel happier then do it NEVER EVER stay in a relationship thinking people are going to change... because they wont, You have to do whats right for you or a few years down the line its will just be worse and you will look back and think "Why didn't i just do it back then?"....And aswell even though I'm saying this you really cant listen to any one els, Its your marriage, your the one that has to live with what ever you do. I wish you good luck and happiness, i really do.|`|AA11749261	Seems like the love in this relationship has gone out. Keep trying to talk to him and get a friend / family member to convince him for counselling. Tell him that he needs to try only one session and if he doesn't like it...he can quit and you can go ahead and just do it yourself. There may more issues that just no communication between you both. Try a heartfelt letter, do something nice, take time to make your lovemaking more meaningful, romance him...maybe all he needs is to relax with you and avoid the stresses of marriage.|`|6mAap6dxaa	Sounds like the love has gone from the marriage. I was in a similar situation with my marriage and what it is......is your man hasn't got enough guts to come out and say its over. He is trying to take the easy way out by making things difficult so you will be the one who ends the relationship. This way they are able to say it was you who ended the relationship.  The only thing left if he won't co-operate with counseling or talking is end the relationship and move on. Yes it will be tough at first but you can do it, then take time to heal and find someone who appreciates you, for the person you are. Cheers and Good luck with Life|`|ZX1AOUHvaa	Chica, it sounds like you've already made up your mind and need some encouraging words.     Arguing hasn't gotten you anywhere and there's no point in continuing. You need someone who likes to go out and have fun!    Not everyone who divorces ends up hating each other. He may be considering divorce too but you wont know unless you ask him about it. If he doesn't want a divorce and you still love him, he has to get counseling.|`|hgSb08h7aa	You should do what makes you happy.  I know it will hurt you when you get a divorce but in the long run it will hurt you more if you stay  in a marriage that only you are contributing to.  Once you file if he doesn't care then you see its for the best, but if you file and he wants to work it out then there might me a chance.  If you don't have any children I advise you to be careful and not get pregnant.  There are so many men out there that would love to have someone like you as their wife.  It will be your husbands loss.|`|IePHZugZaa	remeber the man is always right no matter what... you are the women your place is in the kitchen.. not to think|`|BhlUN71yaa	If you have talked to him and he wont listen, then what more can you do. He obviously doesnt respect you. Try asking him why he wont talk to you. Do you argue with what he has to say when you ask him?|`|9f47bdd6ff1383b2740a669bf5ba5704aa	give him a little dose of his own medicine. dont try and talk to him for a couple of days and go out by yourself. he'll come around then because he will be wondering what the hell has gotten into you. see if that works!|`|AA10574289	Hi Mexicanhoney,    It will not get better, only worse. You have tried everything.  So If you want to remain friends, and not end up hating each other then you should either separate, and see what happens.  Tell him that, and then do it.  But don't say anything till you know 1 million percent you will act on it.  Otherwise when the time comes that you really can't take it anymore he will not take you seriously.     Good luck hon. Personally if you don't have kid yet then just use protection.  You don't need a child to go through a lousy marriage or a divorce.

Y no es lo mismo conocer a alguien cuando ests sola y conocerlo en su vida diaria. Son facetas casi diferentes en su totalidad.    Supongo que es normal que la rutina afecte a la relacin. El hecho de que todo se vuelve predecible y aburrido. A mi me pasa ahora mismo y no s que hacer tampoco.     Si quieres seguir con l, pues intenta hacer cosas distintas. Cosas que salgan de lo normal, que no sean rutinarias, que reavive la chispa que hay entre vosotros. Pero si no quieres seguir con l, la respuesta es ms sencilla. Djalo.     Y no te preocupes.

Te sugiero hablarlo de frente, poner todas las cartas sobre la mesa, y tratar de acordar.  Sera una pena que por una sensacin, tiraras por la borda tanta lucha a su lado.  Dialog, y haclo escuchndolo.   No actes por impulso, no es recomendable.  ??Suerte!!  Saludos.
S2GpgEJ3aa	yes you can still be friends who knows what will come in time|`|WVhYsZ2Yaa	I know exactly how you feel...the girl i'm madly in love with just wants to be friends and guess what..? she's got a boyfriend. She knows how i feel about her.. i have to see her everyday cause of school and its sooo awkward. We're not friends, class mates, we're nothing!     You can try to be friends with her.. if she feels thats the right thing to do. If its too awkward then the best thing is to never see her again. Be with your friends and try to move on and look to the future; you'll find someone soon... you'll be alright!
dbdc0d33eb73f2e24ca9768fc43824c0aa	?Hola Lore!    No todos los casos son iguales. En mi caso me divorci por una situacin de violencia extrema. ?Para los hijos es mejor tener a sus padres separados o tener a uno muerto y otro en la crcel? muchas veces la separacin o el divorcio resultan ser males necesarios a fin de evitar situaciones an peores.    Coincido contigo en que existe un derecho legtimo a tener una familia, pero hay que cuidarla cuando an existe, y no convertirla en botn de caprichos soberbios que nicamente logran desintegrar el matrimonio, la familia y sobre todo, la ilusin e inocencia de los ms desprotegidos: los hijos.    ?Saludos!|`|h2xRyEDpaa	A veces el divorcio es necesario pero no deben olvidarse que vana  ser paps para siempre (y es lo primero que olvidan)  que la vida ya gira en torno a los hijos y si, hay que buscar la felicidad pero principalmente la felicidad de los hijos   Muchos hombres y mujeres se vienen casando o juntando con personas nocivas para sus cros pero no les importa... Un padre lo es para toda la vida y quein diga ES QUE MEREZCO SER FELIZ ANTE TODO pues que no tenga hijos|`|RQntDKugaa	No..no piensan en los hijos...sino solamente en su propio bien..(segun ellos)...su maldito egoismo no los hace pensar que hay hijos que resentiran dicha separacion|`|i0Dydwluaa	Creo que el divorcio es bueno en ocasiones. Yo que hubiera dado porque mis papas se divorciaran, vivian peleando, juntos pero peleando y gritandose lo peor todo el da. Es mejor tener un  tutor responsable que dos tutores que se violentan verbalmente o fisicamente.|`|0JUcE6Xgaa	Es muy cierto tu punto de vista, pero cuantas veces la separacion es el unico recurso que se tiene para una solucion, por dificil que paresca para los hijos, cuando de pronto empizan una nueva vida donde papa, ya no esta mas o algunas veces mama, sin entender que fue lo que paso? es muy cierto que los seres humanos en ocasiones somos muy egoistas y no tenemos tiempo para voltear a nuestro alrededor y ver si es conveniente para todos, cuando esto pasa esto queda fuera de nuestras manos y solo nos queda aceptar.|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Creo que es cierto que todos los ninios tienen derecho a una familia, sin embargo una familia en la cual los padres no se quieren no es la familia ideal, a veces los hijos somos un poco egoistas y no pensamos en el derecho de nuestros padres a ser felices. Si ellos nos siguen queriendo, creo que el hecho de reinicien su vida no deberia hacernos infelices ....

148ce5504b0ffbc8d365367b486a304eaa	whatever you do dont give her a note!!!! sure its classic but u dont know if she'll go round showing everyone. you can give her a note be like saying: do u like me? cuz i heard from some1 that u like me......and it works also if u go up to her and say that b/c if u say it to her and u get shot down you wont have evidence.......keep it honest. and dont talk smooth to her.or place your hands on her with ease. that shows ur a player. straighten ur clothes when she gets around, play with your hair, show interest in her interests, mimic her like if she leans forward a few seconds lean forward too, change the volume of ur voice to match hers. just respect her. compliment her, stand really close to her when u talk to her. but if she backs away u either need a tic-tac or shes NOT interested, but just remember      if you keep yourself outta the game for fear of losing you'll NEVER WIN.|`|Utb9T5k0aa	Say that you "like her" if you do, "love" her, are you sure you really love her?

And if she is giving you signs of affection just casually bring it up. Or try talking to friends of hers to see if she is interested in anyone else first. That kind of thing can be embrassing but take chances in life cause you only have one life to live. Rejection hurts but if you do not try you will always wonder.|`|Uq24NOCyaa	look for opportunities when she's alone. then make your move.

Si casi no se ven no creo que tenga nada de malo.    Aunque mandar el desayuno diariamente, como que no es recomendable, a veces uno quiere comer algo distinto para evitar la monotonia del sandwich o la torta...jajaja    Podras ponerle algunos mensajitos de saludo y de vez en cuando uno cursi(pero de vez en cuando).

Para mi gusto eso de cuidar que desayune por la ma?ana, me parece muy maternal, pero en fin si esa es tu forma de ser adelante, solo t sabes como te est "viendo" l.

e235a831ab0349d1374e4635037879e4aa	La eyaculacin precoz se da en aquellos casos en que el hombre eyacula antes de lo deseado, es decir, que es el reflejo involuntario que le impide al hombre poder controlar su eyaculacion.     Hay varios grados de eyaculacin precoz, algunos ms leves y otros ms severos. Los mas leves se dan en aquellos casos en que el hombre eyacula entre los 3 y 8 minutos luego de comenzado el acto, estos se pueden agravar si no se los soluciona a tiempo.    Los grados mas severos de eyaculacion precoz son aquellos en que el hombre eyacula antes de penetrar a su pareja o lo hace apenas segundos despus de comenzada la penetracin. Estos son los casos ms severos y merecen ser tratados cuanto antes para que no empeoren con el tiempo.    Cabe destacar que la mujer alcanza su primer orgasmo luego de 10 minutos de comenzado el acto, esto condiciona al hombre a tener que eyacular luego de ese lapso de tiempo ya que en caso contrario no estara satisfaciendo a su mujer y esto originaria problemas en la pareja, adems el se sentir avergonzado y triste por no haber cumplido con su rol de hombre plenamente en la pareja. Estos sntomas pueden ocasionar, adems, da?os psicolgicos irreparables y hasta miedo a acercarse a una mujer.    La realidad es que en la actualidad dependemos del sexo para muchas cosas, por ejemplo, la incidencia en nuestro estado de nimo. Esta comprobado que un hombre que vive sexualmente insatisfecho traslada esa insatisfaccin a su vida cotidiana y origina un peso negativo difcil de soportar. Es por eso que la eyaculacion precoz afecta al hombre tanto en su vida sexual como en su accionar diario, en el trabajo, en la sociedad, en la familia, etc.    Por suerte, con los avances en el campo de la sexologa, hoy es posible controlar la eyaculacion precoz para alivio de muchos hombres y mujeres que se ven afectados por este problema.    Disfunciones-Sexuales.com ofrece un innovador y revolucionario tratamiento que corrige la eyaculacion precoz en solo 12 das sin tener que realizar ningn tipo de sacrificio, ya que el tratamiento se basa en la ejercitacin diaria de algunos msculos encargados de controlar el reflejo eyaculatorio. Estos ejercicios le quitaran solo 15 minutos por da y los podr realizar en su casa con su propia mano, sin ayuda de un tercero.     Los tratamientos para solucionar la eyaculacion precoz son generalmente una serie de ejercicios y tcnicas naturales desarrolladas por profesionales que logran identificar aquellos musculos encargados de la eyaculacion y trabajar sobre estos para asi poder tener un control voluntario sobre dichos musculos y en consecuencia lograr eyacular en el momento indicado.    Los tratamientos actuales son muy rapidos y faciles de realizar, algunos logran derrotar la eyaculacion precoz en 2 semanas, hay otros que lo hacen en menos. Todos ellos son efectivos, la diferencia esta en que estos adoptan diferentes tecnicas para tratar los musculos encargados del reflejo eyaculatorio. Cabe destacar que ninguno de los tratamientos actuales supera los 30 minutos.  Algunos hombres optan por recurrir a sexologos a la hora de afrontar este problema, la realidad es que la mayoria de estos sienten verguenza o miedo de recurrir a uno, eso podria condicionar al resultado final y puede ocacionar efectos psicologicos en las personas. Para evitar estos riesgos se han creado consultorios virtuales que ofrecen tratamientos para solucionar la eyaculacion precoz, estos tienen mejores resultados y son mas simples de conseguir ya que la persona no debe salir de su hogar para conseguirlos.|`|a9fa75e6b9478a5684ec4b87f5ce62dbaa	todo esta en la cabeza.

Cute and sweet for the rest of the week.    :)|`|AA11286626	Personality means almost everything. If she does not laugh, she cry's alone|`|82Nqrw0Taa	it varies on the guy. However I think that a combination of the two is best. Like cute and sweet when out and about with him and sexy and hot when you two are alone!|`|BhC5ZGUXaa	it TOTALLY depends on what the guy is looking for. If he wants strictly sex, then obviously he would prefer the sexy hot girl. However, on the flip side, if he wants a future wife or at least someone who is worthwhile then cute and sweet will be the preference.

rhiQB1eiaa	He wouldn't be having the type of contact you describe with you if he wasn't interested.  I'd be more concerned about him:    * Starting up this behavior with you while he's with someone else    * Breaking it off with her and immediately getting a new gf    Caveat emptor (that's Latin for "Make sure you know what you're getting into")|`|f1df915d450337c086af018f7eadf44caa	yeaa...he sounds like he really likes u...i don't think he thinks u like him back because u maybe never lead him on when he does these things. Maybe he is trying 2 make u jealous with girlfriends. Just flirt with him a lot and one day soon u'll hopefully be 2gether!|`|52sfpYe6aa	it seems like he is interested. but dont get 2 involved unless he breaks up...u dont want a girl 2 come after u bcuz she thinks u stole her boy|`|a9wvyRHHaa	well by what you've said id say he is interested in you, its a complete turn around from the way he was before and the way he is is the way i am when i like a girl and also a couple of my m8s are like that.    i think that you should just ask him if he likes you or not, it'll be a lot easier than you think and it'll give you peace of mind about if he does like you or not!    hope it works out for ya :)|`|FOxSvjx1aa	yeah, i did the same thing he did, and took my time as well. i just think that he thinks your not intrested ya dig? shoot the question ASAP|`|7k8QirQzaa	i think he is interested, but when he gets gfs and ends up getting really bad ones, he is trying to forget about you, not in a bad way, its just he has a hard time asking you the right way if he likes you or not. maybe you should step up and ask him if he wants to hang out like go to the movies or something.|`|12ca16050dbc03beca7f7fad9cc4d83caa	how old are you?|`|rBbXtOoGaa	Yes he does.

8d0C9TTXaa	I'm kind of split on this one.    I don't that that you should be angry with her; I think that you should be worried about her. I'm sure that she just likes the attention that he is giving her.    I think that you should apologize and say that it isn't your place to tell her what to do but you just care a lot about her and given the candor of this guy, you're worried about her.    And after that just stay updated on the situation and make sure that she isn't doing anything stupid for this guy.|`|Jbr1UquLaa	I would stay away from him. I've had many creepy guys on myspace or xanga contact me.. and just keep blocking. If you friend wants to talk to him, let her.. but at the same time just keep an eye out for her. If she starts talking about meeting him don't let her.|`|KBCmJi9Jaa	SO WHAT!  It's Bria's fault for flirting with some creepy guy.  Let her suffer the creepy consequences.  Honestly, I think your definition of "creepy" was actually quite funny.  But, I guess that's a matter of perspective.  Are you sure he wasn't joking, or having his fun?  And maybe Bria is just flirting because it makes you angry.    But you do have the right to be angry.  And Bria is right, she has every right to talk to him.  Let her do what she wants.  It's her life, she can mess it up.  She can do whatever, she wants, all you can do is give her advice.
l2KafX5vaa	I'd advice you not to call him. But if you really want to, try using a payphone. Or to be on the safe side, ask him to call you.|`|k4C58QgWaa	dont call him its dangerous|`|WWq79e1zaa	i think if u trust this guy so far it should be fine. just make sure 2 block ur    first adn if he sounds liek a creep dont answer ur phone 4 a privite  |`|T5P4YjHQaa	its *67 or *69, i forget

Vk9HkdTOaa	I don't see anything wrong with you.You are who you are, and that's what matters. Don't make unnecessary changes for anyone. If they can't accept you, move on.    Keep your head high and have confidence in yourself, guys like confident girls. I'm sure you'll end up being happy with someone, but you have to be willing to take some risk of getting hurt and the time to find them.    The best advice I can give you is to not have sex with a guy just because he says he loves you. He could easily leave and never talk to you again. Just make sure you wait until you're old enough to handle the responsibilities and possible consequences. Make sure you have boundaries, that'll be the best way to tell who's a little boy and who's a real man.|`|vdFVKHBVaa	you sound alright to me.. must have been summink else !|`|eLp0nRvYaa	Sweety you don't need anyone else's opinion but, your own. It doesn't matter what's on the outside it only matters whats on the inside that counts. Try to control your temper a little and keep your good sense of humor! Guys love that! Just because on guy dumped you doesn't mean every one will. There is someone out there for all of us!    I hope I have answered your question.    With love,  ?Lindy?|`|KPqdTqdxaa	You're very young you will have a lot more relationships. The first thing that you should do before you throw yourself into the arms of the first boy who asks you out is build a relationship of love and respect for yourself. Ask yourself, Are you using your anger and sarcasm as a shield to block what a weak and self conscious person you are inside? You will never be happy until you right yourself, If you love yourself and don't worry what people think of you that would be the first step to being an awesome, confident person and that's super attractive in a girl .|`|2JP2LT4Haa	i think u dont need anyone elses opion but ur own!!do u!!k!!  just be u!!if u need to lose pounds then fine!!u are not a loser u are just u!!
DWHj3TVJaa	shoot the club and bar thing is one route but most guys at clubs or bars are usually there for just a bit of fun(if u catch my drift)  i know the way my parents met is at a grocery store and i know it sounds weird but all guys are well dicks(i would know cuz im a guy) and i think that you would have a better chance of meeting a single guy at like fair or store or something public like that...but thats just me...or maybe the single guys are just too scared to ask you out you could be too attractive i know there are girls i've looked at and thought wow she gorgeous but was like way outta my league so i stay away from them..|`|7kn0IvOVaa	go to bars and clubs the clubs are a singles activity|`|5xm6pS2Saa	You're just flirting with the wrong guys. Try flirting with single guys at school and people you hang with. Just try not to be flirty around guys who have girlfriends or who are married. But hey, if you attracted boys who just have girlfriends, there could be a breakup, so you still have a chance with them. Plus, there could be a guy out there who secretly is passionatly in love with you. Just don't lose hope!|`|1TrRrWMLaa	You are just being nice, and yourself around them, and they are attracted to you. When you are around single men you may be a little shy or act uncomfortable. That means they are less likely to say anything to you. Oh yeah and men are also jackasses, they are probably seeing if they could attract a good looking single woman, even though they are married. As for bars, and clubs. I would be careful, not to many single nice and good men hang out in them much. I mean there are some, but the ones who hang out in bars usually have a party problem, or are looking for a 1 night stand. I would just be yourself, and keep trying your luck will change.
QTUo5XZDaa	oh definitely. my boyfriends quiet, loves music, thinks before he speaks, and is never clumsy.

qXInYPwaaa	A diferencia de los demas, yo si pienso que las diferencias de edad cuando son tan grandes (20 a?s es demasiado)  importan, mas cuando la mujer es la mayor. No es machismo, es solo que piensa en si quieres tener hijos y eso. Y como ya te dijieron, puede que ahora te paresca interesante una mujer con experiencia, pero pronto ella tendra que luchar con la vejez, cuando para ti es un juego aun. ?No lo vez?  Por lo que entiendo ella ya tuvo una relacin seria y quizas ya tiene hijos y no quiere eso por que tuvo una mala experiencia, tu eres joven, tienes una vida por delante y muchas cosas por conocer.   Al principio puede que no te importara, pero si te das cuenta, no son tus amigos ni tu familia los que te cuestionan, eres tu mismo, si no no les darias importancia. Osea a ti te molestan los a?os que se les interponen ?verdad?  Entonces, por muy bien que lo estes pasando, ya te estas cuestionando el futuro que no vez junto a ella.|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Yo creo que si los dos se divierten, se quieren y no tienen ningun otro compromiso deben disfrutar la vida, no te preocupes de los demas haz lo que te haga feliz a ti, de cualquier forma nunca vas a lograr que todos concuerden en que tus decisiones son las mejores, solo importa que para ti sea lo mejor|`|KyfzTcXSaa	Lamentablemente en este mundo esta muy afianzado aquello de que "si es mas grande que tu, que sea hombre, no mujer" pero es algo muy machista que tenemois toda la poblacin....  Pero hay tantos q logran vencer eso y lograr la felicidad....  Pero el tema aqui es que tu te estas enganchando y ella no... y eso no tiene q ver con la edad... sino con los sentimientos de cada uno.  Yo q tu, si logras quitar todos los prejuicios del entorno, vera qu tanto futuro puede haber de verdad y actuara e consecuencia.... porque sino.... para qu?  Fijate.,...|`|oTkHDspeaa	aqu todos se llenan la boca diciendo que es lo que pasara o no pasara.   yo tengo 20 a?os y mi mari-novio tiene 46  y lo amo con todas mi fueras todo me gusta con el aparte no aparenta su edad ya tengo  1 a?o con el    no se si se acabara o no pero yo estoy viviendo el momento lo amo y siento que tambin el ami por que ha echo cosas por mi que ningn hombre haba echo   cosas que solo hace un hombre enamorado  as que si te sientes bien con ella que mas importa vive el momento su se acaba ma?ana tendrs una linda experiencia que contar..cuidate|`|dbH1EV9caa	Es que todo depende de la mentalidad y madures de la persona.  Nadie puede anticipar a que vaya a fallar o trascender.  Solamente tu sabe como esta el asunto y si desde ya dices estar viendo problemas porque ella no se adhiere a ti mientras que tu si a ella.  Entonces tienes que irte con cuidado porque puedes salir lastimado si te llegas a enamorar demasiado.  Dale tiempo, disfruta lo que estas viviendo y no dejes que nadie dictamine cual debe ser tu proceder.  Solo ustedes que lo viven lo saben.  No quiero desanimarte ni tampoco darte esperanzas.  Si fuera yo me tomara las cosas da con da y dejara las que las cosas fluyeran como sea que tengan que ir.  Como bien dices, si ella esta saliendo de una relacin a lo mejor no busca estabilizarse aun pero eso no significa que la tengas que dejar si sientes que con ella te llevas bien, mas bien preocupate por darle momentos bonitos, quizs con el tiempo de estar contigo ella sienta que tu eres la persona que realmente quiere a su lado!  xito amigo!|`|C8zkgdNjaa	puede fracasar  tengo un amigo que sus papas tienen esa diferencia, la mama como con 50 anos y el papa como apenas 37 i el chico esta mal de la cabeza|`|JWYLxZ0qaa	Cantos a?os te puede llevar Camaleon, dos o tres?.

Si te sigue importando el quedirn vas a tronar con ella, lo que pasa es que te ven q maduras demasiado rpido y para ellos q no han madurado an quieren jalarte a su lado...    El caso es que si ella te ha dicho eso que dices q piensas de ella, entonces vtela pensando. Pero si slo lo inventaste t sin siquiera preguntarlo, el del problema no es nadie ms que t.    En cierto modo maduras e inmaduras, pero aprende a defender tu territorio y recuerda entre quin es la relacin.

Cuando en una relacion solo una persona es la que quiere, esta esta destinada a no funcionar de ninguna manera.

PO9hxdvyaa	You need to go out somewhere with his mom. Take her out to lunch and go to the mall with her. This way, you both can see what you have in common. Moms are hard on who their son chooses. When you have a child you will understand more. She probably has hurt feelings if she is asking her son why you dont talk to her. Make small talk like "Do you like shopping" if she says yes, ask her to go. It is easier than you think. Once you break that bearier, you two will be tag teaming on the son. Open up!

ZJSzDCJyaa	ive come to learn that friends sometimes are better friends if you just let them do things on their own time when it is right for them.also you are right it may sound like no big deal but to her it was.if she wont talk to you right now just let her be and blow off the steam and the next time she needs a shoulder to lean on always be there for her no matter what.|`|550940cae42fb3b02ba909d5e07cddc4aa	The only thing I can think of is to apoligize in person.

One of my friends has no problem forgiving people in person, but on the phone, online, text anything else, she'll say no! Try it, and remember to give her time. If she still has said nothing after a few weeks, write her a letter and put it through her door.

My advise to you, and I know this is difficult, is the give her time and leave her alone.  Shes already told you that she doesn't want you to talk to her so you really need to respect that right now.  Send her a handwritten card validating her feelings.  Something like, "I understand why you can't talk to me right now, but I am sending you this note to let you know that when you are ready to talk I will still be here."  Then leave it alone, let her come to you when she is ready.  If you keep going on and on about it you will push her away more.    Good luck.|`|5110a754f0890492a3b2aff5b1ac5578aa	Your qu. to yourself should be "Why can't I live knowing that a person is angry at me?"    There will be lots of people in your 70 odd years of life who are angry at you for one reason or another.  Some will be valid reasons.    Now, you have to change something - YOUR attitude to yourself.      IF ( and only if) you passed on the info about the girl "really liking" this other guy in good faith, and with pure clean motives, then you can continue unalarmed.    But I think you had ulterior motives when you told him.  You maybe wanted him to ask her out (MYOB, buster), or you wanted her to thank you for giving him the information (Duh!  She did not ASK you to tell him, so once again MYOB, Buster)    So you got wrong on all sides.  Learn this lesson:  STAY out of chicks' business.  Keep your mouth SHUT.    *MYOB = Mind Your Own Business, if you did not know

15YkiBFaaa	Girl, I say that you should have some fun. Don't waste your life away by sulking or crying. Wipe your tears away and let go on some life issues. When stress is high, just take a walk or go to a park and sit there..just take deep breaths and enjoy what the world has to offer. You can still go on nights out with your friends. A relationship can at times ease what you're feeling now. A lot of us has family issues but don't let that get in the way. Take care!|`|AA11796870	hey hey hey !!! slow down gal Take a chill pill dear.  U r really confused, u urself dont know what u r upto!!  Listen, I m a student of high school, one year back ,I had the same problem bcoz someone had broken my heart.Being silent and depresed all the time didnt reduced my pain but gave birth to new problems.I t affected my studies, my relaions with my family and what not in my life.  But after a short vacation wid my cousins has changed me completely,my cousins saw me and they tried to show me the essence of life.They taught me to live again.My sis asked me tht why i was so depressed and the reason I told her,she found it worthless.SHE TOLD ME WHEN GOD HAS GIVEN ME A GOOD FAMILY, BETTER LIVING ,INTELLIGENT MIND,EVERY NECCESITY AND MANY UNEXPLORED TALENTS THEN WHY I M WASTIN MY LIFE.  She told me to thanks god for not sendin me to poor families where they have no food , no clothe and no shelter.  SITUATIONS DONT CHANGE UR LIFE,ITS U WHO CHANGE UR LIFE URSELF .  GETTIN DEPRESSED AND HAPPY IS IN UR HANDS .  WHO SAYS HAPPINESS IS DIFFICULT TO GET, I DONT THINK SO BCOZ HAPPINESS IS IS WHAT U DO.  IF U FED A HUNGRY CAT OR DOG I THINK TT WILL GIVE U UTTER SATISFACTION AND HAPPINESS    SO PLZ PLZ PLZ !!! DONT DESTROY UR LIFE LIKE THIS .  IF NOT FOR UR SELF BUT PLZ LIVE IT NICELY FOR THEM WHO NEED U AND WHO LOVE U|`|25jdHrotaa	sounds like a case of depression  get some anti-depressants before it destroys your life|`|xasM1xD5aa	youll grow out of it. i lost my zest for life around that age too . i nearly had a nervous breka down. also dont feel guilty about your success - screw your family if they have  a problem with it.|`|pfW12yHZaa	Well since i work in the Mental Health field it sounds like you are depressed. You are so worried about your Parents problems that now they have become your problems and they are starting to effect your life. I would say try and help them out as much as possible. Don't get yourself into financial promblems. Tell them you would like to help but that you need to have a life of your own.  You can always start seeing a Psychologist and see how things go but just talk to your family first and I think that they will be supportive of you. Most families are.|`|AA10076854	It's not wrong to have fun as long u're not over doing it, ok? If u're afraid of looking like a selfish person then try to help them a little bit... after, u help urself first of course. How does having fun with something that u like and doesn't involve money (or much of it) sounds like? :) Or even better if u could include ur family in the fun altogether? :D    But sometimes, if the guilt is too much.. I try to do the good things first so I can feel at least a little more deserving of a little bit of fun.. :) Don't worry, I'm 19. I wish u good luck and all the best.|`|0d11d9baa89a8a31e162ca3959de0150aa	layla, I wish i could help you out here. Like you I have lost my passion for life, but then i have good reason behind that.  if you want to talk to me about it feel free my email inbox is always open (reach me via my profile).    as for not getting dressed up who said you have to dress up to go out? as long as you are not going out naked who cares what you ware?   as for your families financial problems we all have those, I've just had to spend a small fortune i didn't and don't have to get my computer back online. But as for you feeling guilty, why do you feel guilty? you have nothing to feel guilty for.  it is up to your family to find a way of getting an income not you. you have your own life to life. you have to think of yourself first (very hard to do i know) Hard to put your own needs before the needs of the people we care about.   Have you considered talking to the samaritans for trained (voluntury) professional advice?  you are 11 years younger than me. so please try and relight that spark in your life. look at your classroom of kids, set aside one day to let the kids just play and have you join in the freeplay to see if you can recapture your childlike (funloving) spirit.     Praying is all well and good, i'm not a believer or religious but they do say "god helps those who help themselves"   so start making changes yourself to put your life back in order. make calls to your partner (if you have one) if you don't have one get one. you may just be lonely and in need of not just a friend but a lover who can anticipate all your needs.  you need to consider a pampering day to treat yourself.  or even a day out somewhere with an old friend or may be make a new friend.   good luck, and remember if you want to talk message me via email the inbox is always open. I can't promise to help but i can listen (read) and offer any advice i can.|`|7mpZmB93aa	Might be depression. Therapy or medicines might help. They didn't with me so I don't have any passion either.  I'm sorry I'm not much help.|`|nhRED2Lkaa	Being passionate is good, but not too passionate. People who are TOO passionate tend to be self-absorbed and inconsiderate of others.|`|9ldImFvIaa	I think you need a good man in your life,someone who would make your day every day!|`|AA10625883	I think you have textbook case of depression.  Stress can cause depression. I'm sorry to say that prayer does not cure depression.  You will have to own this and resolve it - either through exercise, therapy or meds - or some combination.  Life is too short to be depressed and people who have never been depressed lack the necessary context to advise you.  It is like seeing the world through colored glasses.  Personally, I think you should consider meds for a short period of time to determine if it is chemical.  If it is chemical, there is little chance of you getting better - rather, you will learn to live with it - and not happily.|`|MfsF992Gaa	Take some time to yourself to think about what you really want. Could be anything... and go for it. Sometimes we just put barriers up, when we shouldn't.    I teaching isn't the career you want, then retrain. Don't worry about the time it may take to find another job, if that's what you want- its better than being stuck in something thta doesn't interest you.     Or maybe you just need a change of scenary- new school, new town maybe?    Write to some old firends- they'd love to hear from you, its worth it.    But most importantly- look after YOURself. Have some fun- be selfish, so what, you need to enjoy and let go of what others may think of you.    All the best and I hope you feel better soon.|`|df2050c20be5183700bceb1b0bfde5feaa	I would recommend therapy, but try to stay away from meds. Don't worry about what others think of you, and that includes your family. Make the effort to get dressed up and get out there doing the things you enjoy, you've got to actively fight depression or it will consume you.   You are a primary school teacher, you do realize that the kids know something is wrong. So get some help and do it now!|`|aNUAcWriaa	Hi, It happens to us all at some point of time. For some it is easy to get over it and for some its tricky. Step one will be to start admiring yourself. Look at you, you have a job that you love, you are financially better off (than your family) and you are YOUNG.  Girl you are truly blessed.  You have got the all gems in your both hands. I am sure you realize it.  You are a teacher. According to me it is the most selfless profession one can ever do. Its amazing how you nurture the minds of young ones and let them go every year for their better life. How can you ever think of  yourself as selfish. You are a sweet person as well. I can say that because you are so concerned about your family.   But don't think about it all that much, you need to take care  of yourself first before you start caring about others.  Live your life to the fullest. Every single day is a gift that's why it is called present. Have no regrets.   50 years from now, you must not think of a single thing which you wanted to do, but you could not do because of your family. You should be content at that time.  You are religious as well, so  you know that God has plans for every one. God wants the best for all his children. You should not disappoint him. He has given you all the tools to live your life gracefully and have a lot of fun.     Best luck   :-)|`|fEO7rtJLaa	buy a waverunner. it'll make it all better|`|WrwAM6PFaa	Start a daily journal, write what you feel, what you are thinking, and vent in it if you have to..acknowledge what you are feeling bad about in life to try and fix it.  Working out helped me alot also...I could just go for a nice little jog and relax and clear my head...at night i would play relaxing music and pray...Treat yourself like you deserve..you owe it to yourself...when you feel you are "down" or thinking negative..call a friend, read a book, pray, work out, find your thing that helps you...you can do it.|`|KPxAVXxgaa	Maybe you should talk to a doctor, describe this to them and if you have depression theycan give you anti-depresants and you can go back to your old self.|`|wV1LUo4Xaa	Let me put it simple if you think you are right and if you think you are wrong you are right.     the best way to think is to imagine how fortunate you are and that you are more lucky than most others in life.     have someone to talk to, speak and find friends and then you will see that its a great place to be in, be happy the way you are.     enjoy your life    Hisham  hk4848@gmail.com

Or maybe if she asks you to do so.   Yeah, makes sense to me. Although, I'm a little naughty. Not all girls would agree with me.  Depends on the girl.  Have fun trying it out though|`|FUEio2Lqaa	only if you guys are making out. like hot and heavy stuff. other than that i think that it is a total turn off.
v6Def7PNaa	Well, what does it matter if he contacted your son?  He had a relationship with him for how long.  You filed, so stop being jealous.  Go figure that you have control issues with this new dude from 2.5 weeks.  Step back and get yourself straight.  Out of the fire into the frying pan.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	1. Your son is not his son, so he didn't feel the need to call until he was in town.  2. You're still a married woman and have no business shacking up with men you dragged off the Internet. What's wrong with you??|`|MjfrrsGPaa	He shouldnt be making any decisions for you. If you want to take a trip then he has no say in it. Take your trip and have fun.|`|4xFKJsLeaa	Sounds like your not ready for a new relationship. Don't worry about your ex unless you want him back. Do you?|`|f4c231a6e0293d940a2c4bf552f1c3f6aa	Well, you obviously didn't learn from your mistakes.      You separated 5 months ago, you are not even divorced and you move in with some loser that you met through a dating service just 2-1/2 weeks after you met him?  Maybe I read that wrong!  What the hell is the matter with you?      You don't even know that guy?  I wouldn't even have sex with some guy I knew for only 2-1/2 weeks and YOU MOVE IN TOGETHER?    You are obviously very desperate and very dumb, because you are headed for trouble.  Your stupid comment "this sounds controlling to me" made me laugh.   He might not only be controlling.  You might soon find out that he's disrespecful, unintelligent, insecure or abusive, but what would you know?  You don't even know him!      If your son is 22 years old, then your not young, but you are acting like a teenager.  It's time to grow up lady.|`|j9OpZR7raa	I think perhaps you should take a step back and look at everything that is going on in your life right now. It may be that you need some time to yourself without having a man to cloud the view.     You might even consider going to therapy, just to have someone to help you process everything that is going on in your life. It's nothing to be ashamed of. We all need a little extra help now and then.     Best of luck!|`|y5gkm7dUaa	Yes, I agree it does sound controlling. Perhaps he has a jealousy issue....perhaps he is jealous of what you might do and who might know there....  You have to clear all that up.|`|IQDdkz2oaa	It is too soon for you to be moving that fast with a guy you barely know.|`|HDSZs5BSaa	Run like the wind from this new guy.  Seems like things moved pretty fast.  I have to question why you would contact a dating service when your divorce was not finalized, but aside from that, it seems like this new man is dictating your actions.  Don't let a single instance of that slide.  It's like disciplining a child - if you let them get away with it once, they learn how to push you so you let them do it again.  Men are no different.  If you tolerate his bad behavior, it will only get worse with time.  He's a bad one, and perhaps a good dose of self-esteem is in order before you get into any more relationships.

Creo que puedes salir a divertirte sanamente con amigos y si amas a tu parejas pues aguantarte y esperar hasta que regrese o hasta saber en que situacion se encuentra su relacion.|`|ibe6tmPuaa	esperarlo y no perder las ancias porque si es un verdadero amor nunca podria olvidarse|`|2f5951dfd413fb52770c6253f9c7e949aa	si lo amas esperalo|`|ciFN85hYaa	se trata de cuestiones de sinceridad y fidelidad, si realmente lo amas, debes esperarlo y aguantar, es dificilisimo tenerlo lejos, si ambos son fieles y se respetan, en ningun momento tendria que pasarles por la cabeza salir con alguien mas... si crees que no es l quien quieres que llene tu vida, no pierdan su tiempo, hablen y decidan que es lo mejor para ambos, pero si concluyen que cada uno se convirti en la media naranja del otro, resistan! es dificil, pero si se aman con corazon lindo, sincero y fiel.... todo se soporta, todo se entiende, todo se espera!.

UO62SuR8aa	Seamos realistas, no estas enamorada, solo atraida por una persona que supo llegar a tu lado emocional, pero nada ms. ?Por que te lo digo? Yo crei estarlo de un venezolano y vivo en Mxico. Menos distancia que tu, pero el caso es que no funciono, a los 15 das la frecuencia de los mensajes disminuyeron y no paso gran cosa, del "te amo" de todos los das, ya no hay nada. Le escribi despidindome, pues no podia dejar mis cosas, mi ambiente y familia slo por creer estar enamorada sin conocerlo al 100%, seria algo inmaduro y poco coherente, como respuesta recib nada, asi que no era cierto lo que decia sentir. En conclusin amiga, la distancia hace difciles las cosas, sobre todo cuando no existe la madurez para buscarle una solucin. En mi opinin no te compliques la vida, entre ms tiempo pase, ms difcil te resultar olvidarlo. Entiendo que mi historia puede no repetirse en ti (y asi lo deseo en verdad), pero francamente hay que poner los pies en la tierra o plantear la posibilidad de que en verdad l te quiera como dice y vaya a tu pais a quedarse o viceversa, aunque es muy complicado. En fin, ya te di mi consejo, pero la desicin tiene que ser tuya. Suerte.|`|AA11103363	Quisiera poder darte una solucin a tu dilema, pero:  1) no me das mucha info.   2) no creo que sea mi lugar o la de alguna otra persona en el foro el decirte que es lo que debes de hacer en tal situacin.     Muy probablemente, sabes que estos amores que inician en el chat, tienen mucha posibilidad de fracasar, pues las personas no se conocen en persona, y lo suficiente como para construir una relacin duradera. Mas que nada, porque existe la posibilidad de que una o ambas personas le estn mintiendo a la otra.     Pero, si tu piensas que la persona con la cual has entablado esta relacin, es una persona de confianza; y que el amor es mutuo (porque dices que lo amas, pero no nos dices que es lo que siente l hacia a ti), pues yo digo que si son lo suficientemente maduros, pues simplemente les queda decidir cual de los dos se va a mudar para que puedan estar juntos?     O si posible, a donde es que se mudaran? (a un pas neutro).     Pero, para resumir mi respuesta...   No tengo el poder de decirte que es lo que debes de hacer, no soy DIOS. y aunque lo fuese, no te lo dira, pues esa es una decisin muy personal.   Pero si estas segura de tus sentimientos hacia a este chico, y los que tiene l hacia a ti, pues el amor no tiene fronteras.     Suerte|`|Zjj2W1tbaa	Es muy dificil, mantener una relacion a la distancia, si no se juntan , siempre van a estar mal|`|a8123ec4e30342bfb63557ab6308f863aa	No importa la distancia, hoy en da te comento que he encontrado al amor de mi vida, mi ex-novia de hace 18 anos y creeme que estavamos lejsimos, pero hoy estamos de nuevo juntos.

Creo q ms bien se le llama enamorarse a gustarle alguien . Sino ya estara casada y divorciada 20 mil veces. El amor lleva tiempo convivencia, no te enamoras si conoces realmente a alguien , querer es otra cosa. Pero hay algo q se llama enamoramiento y es esa etapa en q recien conocs a la otra persona y todo es color de rosa. Pero de ahi a estar enamorado hay un camino q recorrer.|`|ebS8vDn2aa	El amor es conocimiento y admiracin, lleva tiempo no se da de un da para el otro, se debe dar con tiempos de ausencia, para valorar lo que se tiene y darle su justo valor. Lo otro es enamoramiento, necesidad de sentirse querido, pero tan rpido como viene se va, porque carece de bases reales en los cuales sustentarse.    Un beso.|`|8MWoaGxSaa	Pues aun no lo encuentro pero si creo, mira lo que pasa con estas personas es que posiblemente llevaban mucho tiempo solos y cuando de repente tienen una pareja como que les cambia la vida pues el amor de los amigos es ompletamente distinto al de la pareja y pues posiblemente deseaban mucho sentirse queridos por alguien mas y de otro modo pero esto es al inicio, con el tiempo regresan de nuevo con los amigos...son osas muy distintas, cual es el problema?|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Yo creo que no podemos decir que enamorarse no es cuestion de tiempo es cuestion de quimica entre las personas, y claro que el amor puede llevar a las personas a cambiar su comportamiento hacia sus amigos pero creo que eso no significa que los amigos no importen es solo un momento de 'euforia' si podemos llamarlo asi... claro que eso es distinto a obsesionarse con algo y no querer hacer mas cosas y solo estar con tu novio|`|bf84948641a68454b309bf91a99c4bc0aa	yo creo que el estar enamorado, no es algo constante, sino que se esta por momento, amar amas siempre, a alguien, pero enamorarte, mmm no, te enamoras de formas, de determinadas miradas de el/lla, de detalles, pero no se vive en una nube de amor los 360 dias del a?o, eso creo yo, que hace 8 a?os que estoy de novia, tengo 22 a?os, desde los 14 estoy con el, y si al principio queria estar con el, siempre, porque necesitaba eso, algo nuevo me habia cansado de lo mismo, yo creo que los chicos que hacen eso, es porque lo necesitan, luego que vuelven a la rutina, pasa...  besos nose si te sirvio mi respuesta porque ni yo me entendi, jeje|`|JR0c6ziTaa	Simplemente el ser humano no esta creado para estar solo, como dicen los rabes de  la convivencia sale el amor, puede ser que eso ocurra, una relacin se convierta en necesidad de tocarse, besarse y tener sexo, quizs solo dure meses o un par de a?o, y y cuando se aburran de lo nuevo sigue el mismo patrn. Pero, si existe amores verdaderos, que lastimosamente a veces no pueden estar junto o porque se conocieron muy tarde.

Unless you two find the whole cuckold thing to be kinky and you enjoy not being faithful to one another, then you shouldn't be with him.     Go and find a man that will adore you. Right now, it seems like he loves the sex. Not you.    And if that is true, he'll chase any vagina that presents itself to him.

When you meet the right person they wont need to mess around with a ton of girls until they are ready to get serious, you will both know its right. Your better then what this guy can offer.|`|ZQYx4lXRaa	No you shouldnt cuz he will play you once again|`|29r9un3saa	I guess you should give him another chance and yeah, you need to carefully take him under your consideration. If after sometime  you saw what his doing is giving u the trust which you first had on him, then go for him. Otherwise, I guess, No! Good luck!|`|5d3add048ef2ab3420008fe9c5b68b20aa	Lose him - he won't change, people don't and he has no respect for you or any other woman treating them this way.  He may be "wonderful in other ways" but these days if a guy cheats he could give you HIV.  Stop being a victim, or the good guys will write you off as loser.|`|q2h1v3braa	nope..|`|5debee918420491ae93ce443dfcac6d1aa	no|`|59dd0d0f851dd49189f8dcfb0ec58b68aa	dont give him another chance, players never change..
Q33bdiwmaa	Ok, I answered this question before.  You should have just listened to me then.  But I'll take the 2 points.  HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT YOU, HE FEELS NOTHING FOR YOU.  He is sending you emails ABOUT HIS SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE.  Give me the brick, I'll hit you over the head.  And I'll hit you again, and again.  And again.  Are you bloody yet?  HE HAD SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND EMAILED YOU THE DETAILS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Why are you still wondering about him?  Do you hate yourself that much?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!!!  Grow up and MOVE ON!|`|15YkiBFaaa	Awww..this is sad. I've had that happen to me once and it drove me to insanity. You should just ask him how he thinks of the relationship between you and him and if it's more than a friendship. I know it's a hard and very direct question but at least you'll get to know how he feels about everything. If his response is on the bright side, then just tell him your feelings. But I have to say that it was pretty mean of him to email you the entire descriptions of his date. In a way, maybe he wants you to feel jealous??|`|VyhiR8PCaa	I didnt even read your question. just need the points :P
YlwxJr8Qaa	Meet new people. Why be all sad when you think you have nno chance to live? Why don't you just hang out with new people? Do what you like(football) play it and work with the doctor's do what they tell you. Don't give up hope.|`|VEwM7utCaa	r u 4 real because if u r then please get some counseling and talk with others who r living with cancer key word living ......  u not dead yet so please don't be sad  and sick & MAYBE pass away  and not have closure to this live we r all going to someday lose!  life's a ***** and no one can make it out alive!!!! have a nice day and think positive because you might meet someone real nice in counseling or something who knows. what tomorrows going to bring. so if your just looking for kicks w/ that cancer scheme then shame on u buster!!!!!|`|AA11462969	How about family like aunts uncles! they should help!

m5AHNKK2aa	just cos he doesnt say he loves you doesnt mean he doesnt feel it...don't break up with him just of three simple words...you'll end up regreting it...stick with him...the words may change! good luck! xxx|`|Ctrz56Hmaa	I don't think he does love you anymore I'm afraid.|`|I8TxAl1Faa	he is either cheating on you or he does not feel the same way about you.just talk to him|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Well, if he always used to say I love you, then maybe he does have different feelings now. Maybe he saw a new girl that he found hot, so he tries to be different around you. However, he could just be not saying I lvoe you and not realizing it. It's probably all in your mind. Just forget about that, and think of what a sweet guy he is. So what if he doesn't say I love you all the time. His actions say how much he really loves you. And if he is sweet and treats you the way you should be treated, then he loves you.|`|CGmgULvkaa	Personally coming from experiance I will say that he does. Some possible reasons for this change might be what you would say in return to him when he told you he loved you. Or he might not know if your being serious when you say it. But working with what I have I think so.|`|ghwwf3pTaa	Well these things are not easy to figure out, mostly if this advice that you are seeiking is from someone that doesn't know you both. When someone is saying thank you from a "I love you" this might be for some reason, or he is giving you a sign, either to show you that he is not 100 % yours... some guys do that to win someone. I can only advice you looking at his eyes when you are saying that you love him, the eyes can speak what words can hide.|`|DIG3Ap9Kaa	don't say any thing to him n see what he does n ask him do u love me|`|351ca22f33a7e5681c878358e5cf5cf1aa	I don't know how old you are, but a boy or man will tell you anything including I love you to get you into bed. If he has accomplished that goal then he no longer has to lie to you to get what he wants.|`|dce2b7e03fad6246563e2d4ed8fad9d4aa	if he got on base with you-he is backing out  either way-he seems to have a lax in his attitude  this is what will give you inner gratitude no matter what=this is the best way to good laughter, fun and everwhat=see the lighter side of life, please!, and I am born Jewish    then again I am now kicked out of my synagogue because I am called a rebel, no not for my sins-they felt even if I was an atheist I am still Jewish, yet because I believed in hope and my Jewish scriptures-I am considered a traitor a rebel! Isaiah 9:6 "Unto us a child is born, a son is given, and he will be the mighty God and the prince of peace."    I wish the best for you and this was my breakthrough=when one realizes that Jesus unconditionally loves them  regardless of the torments of evil, problems, tests and trials, and tears through to smiles. May we realize that Jesus brings the  best in life to each of us every day, if we just open our spiritual   eyes=His mercies are new every morning, great is thy  faithfulness (Lamentations 3:21-26,. then a new beginning happens every day.  If you feel lost pray="Jesus help me, I am sorry for letting you down, forgive me and lift me up where I belong, come into my heart to stay, help me find your best way, amen." Revelation 1:1, & 3:19&20 spoken by Jesus from heaven "As many as I love, I rebuke and correct, turn quickly to me from sin. Behold I stand at your heart door and knock, if you hear my word and ask me in, I will come in and be your friend."    If we already had done that then its asking him to forgive and restore the joy of our salvation (Psalm 51)    Jesus understands us heart and soul, he is trustworthy,     have the best day ever, heads up and smiled, David|`|a01b5104e10a1a8830c7fcb88c9e6253aa	no...it sounds like it's over ....and lucky you ....off to the races!    Go girl!    love,  Lakshmi|`|AA11292279	If you want an honest answer here goes: I think that since he now says only thank-you he might not be feeling the same way (sorry) you should sit down and have a private talk with him because it's the only way to know for sure. Also there might be some troubles going on about his head so wait a little bit but if he starts acting even worse then talk with him. Good luck!|`|QsbugJ3Yaa	Well... if everything apart from that is the same then it sounds like he does still love you...  He may even be cutting down on it so it's more special when he DOES say it... I know me and my guy say it so much it seems to not be enough anymore to explain how we feel.    Basically... ask him. Just drop it in lightly (i.e. not accusingly or stressy etc)  He won't know how you feel on this if you never tell him.

But just in case you're really serious and will do it anyways, you should know you need at least two forms of birthcontrol and a condom HAS to be one of them, to protect you from AIDS (the pill does not). You should also keep in mind that no birth control is 100% effective, and condoms--even when used properly--aren't 100% foolproof. Be prepared to deal with the possible financial and health repercussions of your actions.  The girl you choose should understand and accept your motives--if you're only looking for sex and nothing more, she needs to know that. Don't trick her into thinking sex means anything more than it does to you, and DON'T try to use alcohol or drugs to ply her--she can accuse you of rape, plus you probably won't be able to perform under the influence anyways. Obviously, you need to respect her and stop if she says no, even if she said yes until that point--if you don't, it's rape. And if you're over 18, make sure she is too, of course, or else you might have to face jailtime or an angry daddy.  Otherwise, just relax and be yourself. In the end, you'll probably find sex is neither as frightening or as amazing as it's cracked up to be.|`|SVChnDWjaa	get a life

9uyDybAnaa	Para bien y para mal, vivimos en sociedad, rodeados de gente de todo tipo, que opinan, critican, elogian,  o les somos indiferentes. Lo ideal seria, ser uno mismo, andar por esta vida como si nadie te estuviera mirando, disfrutar de tu mundo, de tus gustos, lucir lo tuyo, sentirte feliz de como eres o actuas, sentirte libre de las miradas represivas, del dedo que te se?ala, del susurro al oido del otro......., en fin, de la persecucion constante de esa duda que nos mata de que si esto o aquello que hice, que hare o que uso , les parece bien a los demas. Pienso que un poco que hay que liberarse de esas represiones y sentirnos a gusto con nosotros mismos, por supuesto, siempre respetando al resto de las personas, pero cuando estas en paz contigo, te sientes bien, piensa que siempre habra alguien a quien  por cualquier razon, le parecera mal lo que hagamos.

CnuwupbOaa	I believe it's in the context of the mental growth of yourself. When some people are in a relationship they become enamored which makes them stagnant to progressing in life. Ultimately, you need to achieve the goals you had.

8G42oyydaa	If you think it would be some kind of thrill for an "older lady" 55+ to have your naked skinny *** in the house think again, there is a lot better than you out there, and assuming +55 women are "desperate" shows how young and silly you are because they arent.  If you think +55 is old, you are not a very bright little boy at all.

I would just stay really good friends, and really not think about a serious relationship.    You both are good people, and you both need to have someone there, that person is a friend and you both have one.|`|75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	Wow, you are WAY more into him then he is you.

b0bf624fbe0a9f4a0340d60b74b2d4ddaa	I've done this! Sorry. I think guys like me are insane. I'll be so interested in a girl, we'll flirt and talk and everything is there. Then when she starts to show interest, it starts to scare me when I realize that this could really be going somewhere, and I back off. I feel like all my actions from that point onwards are going to be very read into, and I don't want every little thing I do to be scruntinized. And that I could really get attached to her and something could happen. This just happened with me recently... this girl I adore has just gotten sick of it and has given up after our weeks of weird on and off flirting and private confessionis. I've given up too and I'm sad.|`|862d30fa9db31031d62d1012a3f21e6aaa	That happened to me last year. I was hurt, confused, angry just a ball of emotions.

I felt so insulted, angry and like the biggest fool, it still hurts when I think about it.

I'm sure she still likes you as a friend too but not as much as the other girl. Its nothing personal just a preference.

Maybe you guys will be friends and maybe not, doesn't mean it's any reflection on the type of person you are.  Find another friend.|`|ccDA5blBaa	This has happened to me before.  This is totally normal, especially between girls, because we are very relationship-oriented.  But that doesn't mean we are all going to be the best of friends.

Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with you.|`|Az0pNwyIaa	That's absolutely normal. Everyone has her/his own peculiarities and preferences it just so happened that the other two jived and you did not. Anyway, we are social beings..you just have to adjust a little to them so you don't clash and tell them honestly how you feel about things.

Actually this has happened to me to many times... really it happens to me all the time. It seems that i am just not intresting enough to get a long with people. Maybe because i am a bit old fashion about things... I am not completely for drinking and i am allergic to cigeratte smoke. Soo i can't go a lot of places. It sucks... I know how you feel. I actually blame myself for not being a bit more "Crazy" soo maybe i could get a long with some people. But i ain't that way.. My mother raised me a bit more differently and i am now a married woman with a child. Its a bit more difficult for me to make friends.. It just seems that other people click better because they have a lot of things in common. I see it normal for most girls i don't get a long with, I hang out with guys instead. Mostly cus it seems i can't make any Chick friends... I ain't girly enough or always something.. Soo i just go on with my life and find someone who is into things as much as me or as smart as me. I ain't changing for no one. And i make my own friends, and group.
bb2f8d017666bd375205003615fe1360aa	This is normal & it's still early in the semester so you need to give it time. Some friendships are early bloomers & some are not. I have a group of friends & they are all wonderful but I do connect with some more than others more right now, but there's nothing that I wouldn't do for either one of them. Just see how it goes because you may not become the best of friends but they may turn out to be great respectful roommates. Good luck & I hope it works out for you.

GivKEsJPaa	There's so many factors...First of all, you JUST started taking birth control, and sometimes it takes a few months to get your body used to the new chemicals and hormones, so you might be late for a few months if you're still getting used to it. Next, you very well may be stressed and causing yourself to skip your period. Third, don't be afraid to take a home pregnancy test just to ease your mind...Sometimes things happen no matter how many precautions you take...If you are pregnant, there are many options, and if you aren't pregnant, maybe think about the stress that this situation has caused you and think twice about committing to a sexual relationship in the future...It might make your boyfriend think twice about becoming a father as well.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	Take a pregenacy test and in the future wait to have sex until you are married.

I thought the same thing but I'm not on birth control. I was just late. maybe you'll be late too.. I'm not sure  how it works with the pill though.    she's right, maybe you should talk to a doctor|`|AA12320890	Thats a really hard one but maybe its just stress. maybe it also could be a new reaction your body is making to tell you your body is going thru a change but you should take a preganancy test just in case|`|Uixjy33waa	When you are in birth control you might get some light spotting but however your period might stop completely. Do not be alarmed it might just be the pills. If you have not missed them and you have been using a condom, then you have nothing to worry about.|`|0Cf3bTVSaa	My ex was practically acting the same way wen she was on the pill.  She went to da doctor and he said dat da pills can cause u to miss ur period and dat the crankiness and vomiting can be a sign of side effects of da pill, so da best thing u can do is ask ur doctor, cuz it may just be the birth control dats causing all those changes to ur body!...good-luck!
5lbX631Gaa	no you're not a bad girlfriend...as long as you don't cheat on your bf....you're allowed to have some guy friends. If your bf doesn't take you out that often...then you're allowed to hang out with your friends.|`|PyLAskjlaa	no this happens to me too. just try to meet up whenever you can.|`|3aEzvOBcaa	Continue what you do at this time. Going out with friends is nice and important, if your boyfriend wants he may join your company.|`|H1lZtSEdaa	yes|`|3JQHJTBjaa	i dont think its right at all for you to be hanging out with a guy that you know likes you. even if your bf isnt that great with taking u out ur still going out with him so unless you end it with him u shouldnt be hanging out with that other guy. its not fair to him.|`|J8uRjr1xaa	No your not a bad girlfriend.  BUT it does sound like you guys need to talk about what is bothering the both of you.
f0d22a67cc3d026b3a7b2037dc172f0faa	Sounds to me like you should get an old-fashioned phone with a wire that goes into the wall. If you can find a really old one - pre-1980 or so - they are almost bulletproof. If not, you can get one for $9.99; $19.99 with a message chip. Some people are harder on phones than others. If you break one every three months, better it is a $20 one than a $200 one.
2VXJnNUYaa	Well, it would hurt my feelings if they did that to me.     I bet it has something to do with the person that you don't get along with. If you want to be included badly enough you'll have to deal with the one you don't like to be with the ones you do.    But maybe it's just not worth the compromise. Weigh it out.|`|qi5fcqqCaa	i go to a small school too, and the same thing just happened in my group of friends. 2 of my friends left the lunch table (i know that sounds dumb, but its true lol) and they like totally ditched the rest of our group. what i did was talk it out with them and ask them what we needed to do to fix the problem. then everyone agreed that we needed time apart from eachother. so we took about a month or so, and eventually everyone started talking again and now we are pretty much fine! lol. everyone gets in fights with their friends, and eventually, most people make up!! dont worry! everything will be okay eventually! =) good luck!!|`|27sDtOCPaa	I used to have these to best friends and the same thing happened to me and now im not friends with them and im im friends with the peeople that i was friends with before the two that started ditching me. I dont think your over reacting|`|BTHuYacSaa	no your not over reacting. if my friends did that i would be PISSED off. call them up and tell them how you feel.  or, invite them to do something fun, and pretend to overlook wats happened in the past. if they act strangly around you then you know somethings up. but you cant give them any clues that your hurt.|`|47Ti3zpWaa	Aw that sucks. But yah, I say get yourself around. B/c weather or not you guys get closer or draw apart because of this, I think you'll wanna have more friends just for companionship. You're friends shouldn't leave you out like that so let them know. And if they do know then they're not really good friends to begin with. So now that I guess you're in the gray area start talking to people more, because you have to start somewhere. I hope you feel closer to one of your four friends to confined to.|`|AA11627685	Im sorry.  I dont think your over reacting.  Maybe you should talk to your friends.  Tell them how you feel.|`|JqZpQwt5aa	It sounds like they are intentionally leaving you out. Maybe you just out grew them. It happens sometimes when your friends with the same people for a long time. The same thing has happened to me.|`|GrDYiY4Iaa	You're definitely not overreacting, what they're doing is rude. Make it noticed that you're upset, and try to compromise. If they don't want to, obviously they're not good friends, but I'm sure they are. And what you're doing is good; try making more friends.|`|HfSvAtEyaa	No the best thing to is find more friends...or catch up with friends you forgot you had,..    i had this stuck-up friend who was really close to me in Middle school and then it was like a was "no-one"    She made me soo mad because she would talk about a girl and then hang out with her..i knew that wasn't right..    But then i started hanging out with my friends i put on the back burner...over that *****! now i realize i should have just stuck with my friends im hanging out with now because if you are still hanging out with that other group, you will be further and further apart and getting more upset...    I cried when i knew that my friendship was over with that little ***** from before...thats all she did..    act like a freakin liar to everyone...and acted like i didn't even exist!    But just hang in there...you will have good Karma on your way!    Good Luck! :o)|`|LnfxyTICaa	I don't think you are overreacting.  I think you should try to talk to them and see what's going on.|`|hvHX79tLaa	It seems to me like we kinda have the same situation. Or atleast a close one. I also attend a very small school with only about 100 kids K-12th grade and i am planning on transferring schools this coming year. Well sometimes friends tend to get on each others nerves and sometimes you may get on there nerves and they might just need a break. But this started happening with me and my friends and i was like you feeling all alone and i know its sucks. Right? Anyways after it started happining i realized they did not wanna be friends anymore...its been hard but its getting better....but i have learned that sometimes its better if you just forget about things and move on. Sometimes there is a need for change. Maybe you and your friends hangout too much! I really do not know what kind of friends you have and i am not trying to be rude but i thought i had the most trustworthy friends anyone could ask for and then it turned out i was wrong. People started talking crap and they didnt believe anything i said and it is a big mess. Turns out we arnt friends anymore...all this is an example how things can turn out. But you should ask your friends about this and confront them and tell them exactly how you feel. ok? and also i wanna say i dont thing you are over REACTING one bit! well please email me back and tell me if this might of helped you in anyway.        Hope things tuen out ok and not like mine did!|`|tZBEOoS3aa	hi buddy!the same thing also happened to me dear.my reactions were also same as ur.but now time changed,we r all together again.this up&down comes in this relation.just we have to cope up.it happen when we r getting in habit of concern of someone.what i did?i met my frnds&said what every i was feeling.and gave time for them to think.see friendship is a beautiful bond.and ur lucky that u have got such frnds.so don't lose them.due to small reason dear!i know it's difficult but try my method.if u would share ur feeling with them.they would surely understand.  all the best***

MLjCIX5Taa	Et "quid" des enfants que l'on appelait jadis des "batards", c'est  dire con?us en gnral avant mariage et pas par le mme homme ? La morale bourgeoise s'en est bien fichu....  Je trouve l'ide de filiation sanguine tout  fait nausabonde. Ma fille, adopte plnirement, vien d'Ha?ti. Nous n'avons pas la mme couleur de peau. Aprs quatre ans de vie commune, c'est fou comme elle me ressemble : mmes mimiques, mmes comportements.... C'est ma fille, et elle est chouette.  Si l'ide de famille passe par le patrimoine gntique, quid galement des "pices rapportes", gendres, brus, etc.  Non, dcidment, cette loi ne me pla?t pas.  Ma famille  moi, c'est bien mieux que ?a. Et si je pouvais, elle aurait toutes les couleurs de l'humanit |`|jxO3AsxCaa	Oui, la loi en tient compte. Au dpart, il n' y avait pas d'adoption, puis c'est devenu une habitude et des lois ont t votes pour rglementer les querelles dans les familles entre les lgitimes et les illgitimes. L'ide de famille est une notion plus vaste aujourd'hui alors les problmes gntiques devraient tre rservs aux cas pineux!|`|sLgrxBQOaa	nous venons de commettre une belle erreur avec se test adn parce qu'il est contraire aux droit de l'homme tout simplement, imaginez un peu que lors d'un test on vous dise votre enfants n'est pas le votre, ou pire si on disait a votre enfants se n'est pas tes parents, la thorie est toujours parfaite en soi mais la pratique bien souvent est diffrente, attention aux dbordement !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RVr3K5CTaa	En France, oui, la filiation c'est le lien du sang en premier lieu. Une mre se dfinit en droit fran?ais par celle qui a accouch (Article 311-25 du code civil faisant que celle qui a accouch n'a mme pas besoin de reconnaitre son enfant)     Le pre se dfinit par celui qui a con?u l'enfant (mme s'il ne le reconnait pas, ?a reste le pre car on est pre avant de reconnaitre un enfant, puisque seul le pre a le droit de le faire)    Article 332 du code civil     La maternit peut tre conteste en rapportant la preuve que la mre n'a pas accouch de l'enfant.     La paternit peut tre conteste en rapportant la preuve que le mari ou l'auteur de la reconnaissance n'est pas le pre.    Quand le parent n'est pas le parent gntique, il faut faire des procdures spciales (don de gamtes, adoption)    Le seul coup de canif en droit fran?ais  la paternit gntique, c'est le dlai de 5 ans de possession d'tat conforme au titre ne permettant plus de contester une reconnaissance mensongre (Article 333 du code civil)    Il faut arrter de dlire, ?a fait longtemps que le test ADN est un moyen officiel de dfense pour les actions de filiation et de subsides. Personne n'est oblig de faire le test mais tout refus est un aveu de culpabilit (voyez l'affaire Montand qui avait t reconnu judiciairement comme pre uniquement parce qu'il avait refus le test ADN)    Enfin, l'Etat s'est toujours donn le droit de contester une filiation, le moyen de dfense est alors le test ADN. Cette loi ne fait qu'tendre aux trangers ce qui existe dj pour les Fran?ais    Article 336 du code civil    La filiation lgalement tablie peut tre conteste par le ministre public si des indices tirs des actes eux-mmes la rendent invraisemblable ou en cas de fraude  la loi.    Ce n'est pas parce que vous ignorez la loi fran?aise et la tradition de cette loi, qu'elle n'existe pas.    Cette loi tient compte de l'adoption : il suffira de produire le jugement d'adoption conformment aux droits internationaux de l'enfant.|`|q8t4MPpVaa	Le code civil tient compte de tout, de la filiation lgitime et naturelle : la mre est la femme qui a accouch de tel enfant, le pre est l'poux ou l'homme qui a reconnu cet enfant, s'il est n hors mariage. L'adoption est organise par la loi, selon des rgles strictes qui ne laissent pas la place  la fantaisie. Nous sommes en France, pays civilis, encore!  Qu'on le veuille ou non, le patrimoine gntique est dans l'ordre de la nature et il nous est utile dans de nombreux domaines, surtout en matire de sant.|`|rhCV2qAkaa	En droit fran?ais, la filiation n'a rien  voir avec le sang. Si vous tes maris l'enfant est dit "lgitime" et aucune formalit n'est ncessaire pour la reconnaissance de l'enfant. Si vous n'tes pas maris, l'enfant est dit "naturel" et le pre doit reconnaitre l'enfant mais aucun test ADN n'est requis. On ne demande pas au pre s'il est le gniteur, il peut parfaitement reconnaitre un enfant qui n'est pas gntiquement le sien.  Donc non, le patrimoine gntique n'a rien  voir avec la famille et la filiation en France.

La verdad es que fue genial.  En Costa Rica alquilamos una 4x4 y fuimos visitando distintos lugares, es muy lindo y como los caminos estn en muy malas condiciones fue toda una aventura llegar de un punto a otro. Adems tens muchas opciones de actividades y no necesariamente tens que estar todo el tiempo tirado en la arena como un lagarto.  La pasamos muy bien y la visita al canal de Panam fue inolvidable.  La verdad es que nosotros elegimos ese destino porque queramos hacer algo distinto y no depender de ningn bus que te lleva y te trae de un punto a otro. Adems como nos casamos en febrero (verano Argentino), muchos de los posibles destinos que tenamos en mente era invierno, pero en Costa Rica el a?o se divide en estacin lluviosa y seca as que no hubo problema.

Il demande aux gens : Qui aimerait avoir ce billet ?      Les mains commencent  se lever alors il dit : Je vais donner ce billet de 20 euros  quelqu'un d'entre vous mais avant laissez moi faire quelque chose avec.        Il chiffonne alors le billet avec force et il demande :      Est-ce que vous voulez toujours de ce billet ?      Les mains continuent  se lever.        Bon, d'accord, mais que se passera-t-il si je fais cela. Il jette le billet froiss par terre et saute  pied joints dessus, l'crasant autant que possible et le recouvrant des poussires du plancher.      Ensuite il demande : Qui veut encore avoir ce billet ?      videmment, les mains continuent de se lever !        Mes amis, vous venez d'apprendre une le?on...      Peu importe ce que je fais avec ce billet, vous le voulez toujours parce que sa valeur n'a pas chang, il vaut toujours 20 euros.        Plusieurs fois dans votre vie vous serez froisss, rejets, souills par les gens ou par les vnements. Vous aurez l'impression que vous ne valez plus rien mais en ralit votre valeur n'aura pas chang aux yeux des gens qui vous aiment !

Il faut savoir que, sans vouloir jeter la pierre aux femmes qui ont dit non et n'ont pas t entendues, un non ne veut pas toujours dire non dans la bouche de certaines femmes et dans l'oreille de certains hommes (ce qui n'excuse pas tout). Je connaissais un gar?on qui sortait d'une relation un peu spciale avec une femme qui avait un fantasme de soumission (assum et consenti, hein) et qui disait souvent non en pensant oui (accord entre eux, ?a n'avait rien d'implicite) pour entrainer une simulation de situation "force". Du coup, quand il n'a plus t avec elle, il a t totalement dboussol. Il ne savait plus si on lui disait non en pensant non ou si on lui disait non en pensant oui mais en n'osant pas parler franchement du fantasme que la personne pourrait avoir. Bon, dans le doute il s'abstenait, bien entendu. Mais il faut galement comprendre que parfois ce n'est pas vident que non c'est non.  Aprs il est certain qu'il y a vraiment des malades qui ne comprennent pas du tout qu'on leur refuse quoi que ce soit et d'autres qui, dans le doute, ne s'abstiennent pas alors qu'ils devraient.  Je peux comprendre qu'un type soit dboussol mais uniquement s'il s'abstient. S'il ne s'abstient pas, je refuse de comprendre. C'est trop facile de se dire que dans le doute il vaut mieux penser que l'autre va dans notre sens ou que toutes les personnes fonctionnent de la mme fa?on et que ce qu'une a accept les autres accepteront forcment. L c'est vraiment abuser.|`|b7IuhSPMaa	ils sont comme ?a de nature!!!|`|M9nklJsPaa	parce qu'ils peuvent etre amoureux , qd mm, et que leur amour se termine pas en mm tps que celui de leur partenaire, alors ils esprent encore....c'est sain comme raction non?  ou alors, le "non" est tellement peu convaincant ...|`|9eb5d8c77b6e6770fe05b9e1a93ea490aa	parce qu'ils pensent que quand tu dis non, tu penses oui... alors...

J5wrQ6nKaa	Salut Mao,  Ta question est vraiment pertinente mais la rponse est simple ma chre. Aimer c'est dj le contraire de l'go?sme. Il est largement normal que tu puisse te prfrer parce que si tu n'tais pas cre, tu n'allais pas avoir l'occasion d'aimer les autres. il est donc normal que tu puisses te prfrer et aimer les autres car c'est la recommandtion biblique: aimer vous les uns les autres. Lui mme qaui nous a cr n'a jamais demand  ce que on puisse se prfrer. Et le le fait de te prfrer, prouve  suffisance que t'as la gratitude envers celui qui t'a con?ue et aimer les autres c'est dj beacoup  pour toi ma chre. Si tu peux aussi m'aimer, je serais trs content!!!!!  Bisous!!|`|faOcUwGlaa	non, si on ne s'aime pas, on ne peut aimer personne d'autre|`|7b81c2383570d399141a0812e4001896aa	non raliste, mais tout dpend  quels points|`|21ynNEvtaa	il faut commencer  s'aimer pour pouvoir aimer les autres!|`|PuFu88rxaa	si tu t'aimes cela signifie que tu aimes tout le monde ,t'es pas go?ste|`|jNECtPeQaa	Non ce n'est pas de l'go?sme, je trouve que ton raisonnement est correcte car la bible dit Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi mme.

Ou bien, elle est tellement en inscurit qu'elle a perptuellement besoin d'tre rassure. L, le problme est diffrent mais l'effet est le mme, au bout d'un moment, ?a devient usant de devoir faire ses preuves.    La seule solution pour trancher le problme : dire frontalement  la fille que tu ne supportes plus de devoir faire tes preuves et que si ce que tu lui donnes ne lui suffit pas et bien tu n'as rien d'autre  lui donner et qu' ce titre, il vaut mieux que tu t'en ailles. Regarde sa raction et tu sauras quoi faire je pense !

Merci pour ta question. Si une fille teste  tout moment la jalousie de son copain, le but est seulement de le maintenir toujours auprs d'elle sans qu'il ne pense aux autres filles. Elle cherche plut?t  ce que le mec ait seulement ses regards sur elle seule. Et aussi elle n'a pas trop confiance en son homme, donc il faut toujours le tester pour  voir effectivement si ce qu'il a dit vient de son coeur; s'il est vraiment fou amoureux d'elle. J'espre que j'ai donn une rponse  ta question et je crois qu'elle sera la plus apprcie.

OR    you can practice bball and vball on weekends. if you have time[:|`|rs7GKJTQaa	go to vball and bball camps over the summer and pratice at home or rec center...

She grows stronger when she sees you getting pissed at her. dont show her that. tell her "whatever,tell it to someone who cares."girls like her just live to be the center and they are just desperate for attention.i bet you are way better at a bunch of stuff than she is.Do your best in whatever you do and you will get the best of her. I'm horrible at sports and people do laugh at me, but i dont let them, because instead i let them laugh with me. it is more fun to laugh at your mistakes yourself and feel confident than let someone else laugh at you.|`|fno3tplkaa	just ignore her and 4 the sports practice practice practice or sign up 4 camps|`|9HESac2paa	Practice makes perfect and if she gets in your face again, hit her head with a volley ball (make it seem accidentally).

fmngKQWKaa	Cowboy1 lied to you he is busy and didn't text you and maybe wasn't interest in you anymore.You and him got caught at the bar he was wordless and you were with someone else,let say even if you stay at home he was planning to go to the local bar for fun.Maybe he wanted to get even with you,and he doesn't know if your friends or a new date.You can call and text him and explain to him it may be over between you and him or you both will date again.
AoeZvng5aa	Because, lacking any more information, it seems you don't know him very well.     Love takes time to develop. It builds on friendship, on shared values, and on trust.     If this person is in the role of an instructor, and nothing else (if you're not dating him), then you can't have the knowledge of him that is required for love.     You might want to ask yourself this question: what is it about your instructor that makes you feel that way?     Looks? Brains? Sensitivity? Humor? Involvement with the subject matter? Expertise?    Are any of these aspects of yourself that you need to develop?    And yes, I've experienced crushes on teachers and I've also experienced true love.     You can't love another until you know what it is, in the world, that you love and value most highly.     Sometimes this takes a very long time, but the journey is interesting.|`|VO6zNbdMaa	i was young once.and it took me many years to learn what love actually is.its not something anyone can explain.its something you feel and it took me losing someone to learn

Lo que a tu esposo le sucede es que esta desencantado porque ahora ve la realidad de las cosas. La diferencia de edad es un muro que se ve con el tiempo.

Un saludo.|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Yo creo que deberias preguntarle que es lo que realmente le molesta, tal vez hubo algo de lo que tu no te diste cuenta que no le parecio y no te lo ha dicho.

Why would you even bother risking your relationship? Because eventually, your wife is going to find out and your relationship will be lost. So shame on you for doing this to your own wife. I mean, you have two phones so one of them will show up on the bill! What will she say to that, huh? She'll get very suspicious and ask you why you have two phones. But it's your life, so if you choose to do this, it's not my problem.|`|lvowivHnaa	Hmmmmmmm I wonder if shes doing the same to u!I hope she does,and for a longer time.
uz0n8fRIaa	Time... Really. You have to feel the pain and eventually it will dissipate. Write in a journal, listen to your song, cry... Don't do immature things like drive by their house and call & hang up or anything. Mourn the loss of the relationship in private. When you feel like you're healing, write the person a letter telling them that you're ready to let go. Pour your heart out. Don't send the letter though... Burn it. And as it burns, you will heal. It's amazing and catartic. (Yes, I have done it. :) )    Good luck to you.|`|WYnaBeIfaa	Love is --> the overwhelming desire to GIVE.    When the other person is not interested in giving AS WELL, then you are no longer "in love". That's what being "in love" really is  . . .  two people that GIVE to each other.    So . .. . . .   you must remind yourself that you would never invest your MONEY into a STOCK that crashed. So why would you do that with your HEART?????    Being fulfilled is about seeing a return on your investment. Whether you invest your TIME, your FEELINGS or anything that's YOURS . . . you WANT to see it come back because being in a relationship that WORKS is about two people who have the MUTUAL DESIRE TO GIVE TO EACH OTHER EQUALLY.    When it doesn't work . . . . invest ELSEWHERE.    HOW???    Slap some sense into yourself in the same way that you would if you were talking about your MONEY which you worked so hard to earn.     You deserve it.    :)|`|th6MfWCRaa	Hook up with with  another person.|`|IDfN3KQpaa	Try to realize the good things you already have in your life....if you have children or good friends or other blessings that you can put your time and energy into, then I think that helps keep your mind off of them a little.  It is very hard and every single day I think about my past relationship, I love him so much and I just try to remember the things I did wrong and try to fix them and I try to believe that someday someone better (if that's possible) will come along.  It's really hard to move on, it has been over four months now for me and I think of him constantly wishing and hoping that he will come back if only to be my friend I would be so happy, I miss him and I will never find another one quite like him.  He was my dream, my everything, and I will love him until the day I die.
5xm6pS2Saa	Okay, WEIRD! Maybe you're just imagining things, but that does sound a little strange that her parents were unharmed. I mean, if the car has damage then they must have gotten hit. Just try to forget about it, but if this dream happens like every night, then tell your parents or somebody to see what they say. You could be like a Nancy Drew in this situation!|`|HD0CXdvkaa	You can go to a therapist and see if anything like that has every happened to someone before. Because what if her parents did kill her. You can't let them get away with it, if it really did happen. You hear her spirit because you loved her like family & she loved you too. And if you really did care about her you would know to get help and tell someone about what is happening to you.|`|qXVcQ5aBaa	go n see a therapist...tell him/her exactly what you see and feel. share it with your parents too. you will have support.   you see illusions of your friend because you loved her a lot. cant comment about the accident though its quite weird. a therapist would comfort you better.
xm7kFnfNaa	Honestly, if you're looking for the golden grail answer, there isn't one. Interpersonal relationships tend to change on the drop of a dime. One day you may have a guy friend of many years who was totally and completely a platonic friend before he wakes up one morning and realizes he is madly in love with you. You never know when you'll suddenly have feelings for someone so its always best to play it as it goes and take it as it comes but be honest when it does. If you're not interested it'll look like it hurts him at first and things may get weird, but you'll have saved him twice the pain that way. In any case, befriend him as a common friend with no sexual pretenses at all. If its the sex that he wants he should eventually give up if you're not giving in. If it's the friendship he wants, nothing should change!     I hope this helped!

There are things that bind, and things that say it isn't going last.  Best to get some couselling from someone much older and experienced, and then make a decision wiyh your boyfriend. Things aren'r roses forever, but true love overcomes all.  Find out now, before something untoward happens that you CAN'T change.   Pregnancy.
qZY9I7g8aa	You cannot contribute it to being in Los Angeles, it is everywhere.  You have to change where you are meeting these girls, go to new places, different surroundings.    Don't settle for less than you feel you deserve.    Good luck!
4mR8eTjsaa	To be honest, you are to young to date hunny.  You don't really need to be thinking much of girls, you should focus more on school, then when you get a car or get into highschool, then maybe you should consider dating.  I started dating too young like that, and I went through to much pain, I was to young to go through that pain.|`|AA10554197	there's nothing wrong with hanging out.|`|YwcsblD4aa	since your so young.. you dont have alot of experience and its kinda hard to have a real girlfriend .. but if you like her, then ask her to be your ''girlfriend'' its not a huge commitment, just hang out go to the movies all that stuff, nothing serious. my first boyfriend was in 8th grade, and it was really fun.

3T9KWLBzaa	that sucks  i think you should go up to her and tell that you don't appreciate the way she is handling things   tell her she has no right to be calling you names especially since you didn't say anything   if she doesn't believe you then just tell her that its up to her to think whatever she wants and that your conscience is clean  then tell her to have a nice day and hopefully there wont be any inconveniences later on  if she say like what will happen or are you threatening me just tell her that what is going on is childish and that we're young adults and we should act like ones  hopefully it helps  tell her in a calm voice :)|`|TYJjicBqaa	tell her that you did not call her like this and ask her to stop.if she doesn't stop talking to her.being in the same class does not mean that you must talk to each other.right?if she keeps doing it tell her to **** of but politely!if she starts yelling answer calmly!that is how you are going to show her that you do not give a **** about her words!!!!      good luck!|`|i0oF9CjJaa	Why did your friend tell her that?

7gWCMH64aa	I think you have issues. You were sexually abused for years, with degradation heaped upon you. Just as a precaution I encourage you to discuss your experiences with a professional.

AA10517241	The morning will bring a better day.  What you need now is to find some adult to talk the situation thru with as you move forward with your life.    I am here a good bit if you care to talk.  just email me
BykL0txuaa	Been there, sweetie.      Get a lawyer.  Save up for one or get one to do your case pro bono if you can get lucky enough to find one like that.  If he's going to fight you for the child, make him work hard to do it.  Right now he sounds like he's trying to intimidate you.    Also, make your home as pleasant looking as you can.  Get a job if you don't have one and a doctor's statement that there is no reason why you can't raise the child on your own with your future husband's help.  Keep your image as squeaky clean as you can, as well as your fiance's, and be ready to fight this jerk.      And gather as much proof and records of his wrong doing's as you can.  Show the courts why you're the better choice to raising your child.      Good luck.|`|qFP6uddCaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much he is probably saying that so you won't go after him for child support. He thinks if he tells you that you will leave him alone. Yeah it is F***ed up. He will have to prove a whole lot to get custody. Keep your house spotless & if it's not & someone you don't know shows up knocking do not answer the door. Unless they have a lot of money I don't think you have much to worry about.|`|H8yLxOf5aa	I think you need to find a lawyer to inform you of the law in terms of custody, i also believe he has no chance to get it,how does your partner feel about it? Some men will do and say anything to get into girls pants, but you should not worry about this know, as the situation has changed for you, I'm assuming you have a child and you are engaged to some nice guy whom wants you and your child to be with him enjoy your new life and try to forget what his done to you.  Research your situation with a lawyer.
dZfBfYOVaa	Novi sakit hati sama co?  Sekarang aku nanya balik? Gimana cara balas dendam sama cewek........?|`|tyCg14SVaa	Caranya:  1. loe jadian ama co yg lebih baik dari dia (buktiin klo loe bisa dapet co yg lebih baik)  2. Trus loe bermesra mesraan di depan co loe (bikin dia nyesel klo dia udang ngelepasin loe)  3. Tunjukin ke dia klo loe bisa lebih bahagia tanpa kehadiran co loe (buat co ngerasa gak ada artinya lebih sakit dari apapun)    tapi klo loe keliatan sedih gara gara ditinggalin co itu, dia malah makin seneng|`|rSQ0qw7laa	sebenernya sih gua gak saranin untuk nglakuin ini,  tapi rasanya klo loe dah kepepet n pingin nglakuin sesutu  " pacarin saja sahabat dekatnya"  tapi klo bisa jangan ya non  ada cara lain koq yang lebih bagus  kembangkan dirimu, semakin keluarkan inner beauty, luasin pergaulan, tingkatin karir/prestasi  wuihhh pasti tuh, dia bakal nyesel bgt....  ok ok ok|`|K6DvrpB2aa	Gak Tau, gue belom pernah pacaran sama cowo sih !!!!!!! ?|`|IysGGnivaa	Aduh Novi,    kenapa sampai begini - balas dendam !.    saya emengerti anda begitu sakit hati, sehingga terbersit anda akan melakukan balas dendam kepada seseorang cowok.    kita bisa saja balas dendam, sebab itu untuk pemuasaan hati dan perasaan kita yg lagi kalut.  akan tetapi coba dengan kepala dingin kita pikirkan '' balas dendam''.    -  balas dendam tidak memberikan hasil apa-apa.     hasilnya hanya negatif, sebab kita menunjukkan perbuatan     yg tidak dewasa    -  kalau toh balas dendam sudah dilakukan, apakah kita akan     tenang?.     mungkin akibat dari perbuatan kita akan berbuntut.       -  tidak ada satu cara balas dendam yg ampuh, yg membuat     pikiran kita senang, hati kita lega, dan situasi kita aman.    Jadi yang semestinya Novi kerjakan/lakukan adalah ; bertindaklah dewasa, kalau anda merasa telah dirugikan karena cowok itu ( asalkan tidak tindakan kriminil), maka anda akan jadikan suatu pelajaran berharga dihari-hari selanjutnya.  Semua yg kita lakukan, bukan berarti kita sebagai wanita selalu mengalah - bukan!.

You should as he says goodbye sometime ask him for his number, and then say and here's mine if you'd like. Then say "I'd like to talk more sometime" If he's shy you should make the first call. As you talk more he should open up and then once you two really get to know each other ask him out, and he'll probably say yes.    Pretty much always works for me.|`|Tsevf3NVaa	maybe he juz wants to be friends 1st juz enjoy each others company and see wats gonna happend next. goodluck

Good Luck!|`|F3EhopE8aa	go for it|`|o3TaCuP1aa	No offense but that's kinda shallow. he may be hot but he could be a total jerk too.

WHHxgKvwaa	I've heard alot about people losing their houses and life savings over this. You have kids to support and this is a serious addiction.

He needs to get into GA right away or you're going to kick his *** out right now. Tell him if he doesn't stick with it then he is gone! Take the credit cards away, put the money into an account with your name only, and make him turn that pay check over to you right when he gets it. Give him an allowance for what he may need through the week, gas, if he smokes cigarrettes, lunch, ect.. What ever you do don't let him control the money, nor let him have access to your bank account at all.|`|d2SqkOGQaa	Addiction is a very difficult problem. It is way more powerful than you and is much more patient than you.  The problem really isn't yours it's his addiction and only he can make the change. You need to get an education about how addiction works in the brain and the different triggers that get him going in his addiction.   His first step is to admit his addiction and then go get help which is a very bumpy road.  This is the 12 step prayer but as you read it you can apply it to yourself too.  'God grant me the serenity to change the things I can  Courage to accept the things i can not change and   wisdom to know the difference'  Good luck|`|DzIV6OHPaa	Follow your instincts on this one and go w/ what your gut tells you.|`|IePHZugZaa	YOU SHOULD GET HIM TO MAKE GOOD BETS ..BET ONLY ON WINNING POSSIBILITY'S ..SUPPORT HIM|`|b1dec7bfdb10cf12dc76584089e70cf2aa	whats booking
WriYeGrbaa	That would raise a weird red flag if my man had porn and definitely fantasies with my friends on top of that. Just dump his *** and get a real man. He does not sound like he is interested and is making lame excuses by saying he is tired.   He dosent want to have sex with you. Why dont you just make him by setting the mood, and if he refuses then you will definitely know and find that there is clearly an issue, if he does not go for you. I dont think its fair for him to have pixs of your friends like that. He should be all about you and you should be his girl and treat you and your friends with  R-E-S-P-E-C-T . DUMP HIM AND UPGRADE WITH SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE SEX.

AUCwzXFUaa	I think you do need to approach him on how you feel about him. If you don't take the chance on letting him know then you will never know how he feels about it. I know the situation about you dating his uncle before is a sticky situation with you but maybe he doesn't even think about that when he sees  you. Sometimes we just get a thing stuck in our mind and then can think about anything else becuase it is there clouding the other things. Don't let you going out with his uncle once and talking a few times ruin your chance at happiness. That happened in that past and I am sure everyone has moved on.|`|87d382d797226dda65e1e5f00af3711caa	IF you just recently called it quits with his uncle, dont go after him just yet.

Every moment in life gives the opportunity to experience contentment. Don't believe you're going to be happy with one person in your life. There are many people out there why do you want to commit to this so soon? I don't recommend that you do so for the obvious reasons. It's really up to you. You also have nothing to lose if you really thing about it.|`|cv3rEHCmaa	yes girl speak The truth,I told my boyfriend how I felt and it work for me.|`|tiZZcNdWaa	Well..It does look bad but reading what was going with you and the uncle, it doesn't seem like much was going on. You two were just talking. Really, honestly, you should speak to the uncle about this before approaching his nephew. But I don't know that the nephew would feel comfortable. It's kind of sticky. You weren't physical with the Uncle so it's like you two were just friends. Talk to the uncle first & see how he feels. Good luck.|`|k76ObwAeaa	Yeah you should!  You never know, it could work out    ;]
W3HQwrgBaa	Can I be one of those lucky friends?|`|CnuwupbOaa	They believe you look really good without make up already. The make up just accents your facial attributes.    Technically sticking something you your cleavage is considered sexual harassment. Don't put up with that at all. They're going to keep doing it or even push it if you allow them to think it's okay to do so.
AA11603474	How do you know that girl is the girl?  You just think she is.  When the right person comes along, you won't have that problem.  Chances are it will happen when you least expect it.|`|IePHZugZaa	YOU KEEP DREAMING

If  you  can't  do  that,  then  go  to  the  "card  shop"  and  find  a  greeting  card  that  pretty  much  expresses  your  sediments.  You  could  even  write  a  thought  or  two  of  your  own  and  then  put  it  in  the  mail.  She'll  appreciate  it.|`|ANLsixiNaa	please. just thank her for having been in your life.. no matter how long it lasted. and apologise for anything that u feel you did wrong and move on and learn by your mistakes. not enuf people say thanks for the good lessons we picked up along the way from people we been with.. so thank u 4 asking that and making me think. i give u a star xx|`|0b8db0ba29e1be2aab2a7322891be7fcaa	You can't. You have to use your LUNGS.|`|vxz2lx7Paa	I suggest that you buy an apologizing, romantic greeting card. Write on the card as well as use a blank paper to write and insert the paper in the card. Do not make it any longer than writing in the card and on both the sides of the paper.   Take few days and think, think, and think while writing. Start by mentioning what you have been doing now a days with your life in general. I am sure you are thinking about her all day. Mention how you think of her, and describe after how you feel. tell her in details on how you regret and how you plan treat her different when she comes back to you. I am sure you are planning to treat her differently.  Always, write apologizing words at the end of the letter.|`|60971347eee441a7bcfa07148fa56a5daa	To speak from the heart is to hurt like the person you hurt. Imagine that she told you something so hurtful like she aborted your child how would you feel? If you are really sorry it should come to you naturally.The only reason why can't speak from the heart is because you don't love he from the heart. Sit and think real hard about how you feel about her if you truly feel anything you can write, but if you feel no love well, you need to talk to her and let her know before she fall any deeper to where she will be crushed. If she has any true feelings for you it will be hard because she has invested heart can you truly say that you have done the same. Think long and hard on how ou truly feel about her before some one gets hurt.|`|HUYkRAmuaa	just write what you first feel, think, and can come up with. and never doubt what first comes to your mind becasue thats gut instinct. shell decided whether she think your full of **** or not, so just give it your all|`|AA12198286	Good luck.The heart is full of crap any ways, so go ahead and say it like it is. Speaking from the heart is being absolutely honest and that's what you want to do. Don't worry about how you sound to her. You should be satisfied that you are speaking your mind and speaking honestly.|`|fpSGkfvEaa	Don't over think it. If you do then it will sound like your full of crap. Just grab a blank piece of paper and write down exactly what comes to my mind unfiltered and don't edit or fix it after wards. Send it to her as is.|`|8264831b00ba0b834e25b13ea671d112aa	well a girl knows whats true if you are sorry then tell that you are and that you wish things could have gone differently and tell her that you have made many mistakes in life and that you wish that you could go back and change how things happened but be hinest with her from the begining and just tell herr what your heart is telling you and sign it with something like all of this is true or all from the heart and your name and good luck|`|9bpBr0pJaa	you have to write what you feel for her that is what it means|`|2abd5dc5033963f1ceedf5ae001e501aaa	Speaking from the heart is exactly that 'speaking from the heart' You don;t need any outside intervention or any thinking. Just pour Your feelings on to that paper. You can even try sending her a audio message if you like so that she can hear the passion in your voice as you speak.|`|2f5133b4b3f8053e316f8a85fa3fe8e7aa	As you say, speaking from the heart is hard but if it's really true, it will be so easy!  I will tell you, if you really want to apologize in your letter, write as the person you're talking is in front of you!   I have already done that before and it goes well! talk about what you feel!   If it's really from your heart, don't care about the way you will write it, just follow what you want to say and to make her understand.  I'll tell you, it's better to talk in front than to write, though the letter will mean much more than the word spoken.  courage !|`|f1d34Zmkaa	u cant
CnuwupbOaa	No. If I wanted to be friends I wouldn't have said it at all. That's just awkward in any situation.    That just means he's reserving himself momentarily or a white lie of rejection.|`|aft7KQjSaa	Yes,  I've told a couple of girls in the past when I was not looking for a girlfriend that I just wanted to be friends.  I had to make sure they understood that I was not in a situation that I would have been able to be a decent boyfriend to them, all parties involved were constantly drinking heavily and I wanted to cover my bases with them before anything stupid occurred.  I liked hanging out and drinking with them as they were friends from back in the high school days.  Yes, guys can say that and mean just those exact words.

CnuwupbOaa	That's really inconsiderate for her to give you the silent treatment, also for her kids to not meet you. You have to remember that she's not really looking for a permanent companionship with a man anytime in the future. The word 'dating' means no commitment. It can easily turn on and off. She really wants to put her children first. You can tell because she's really trying to preserve her children's mental health by not allowing them to know that mommy's' dating.    Leave her a voice mail and leave it be until she responds; if she responds. You try to communicate with her several times and different ways then she might feel smothered. I believe voice mail would be the most urgent way for her to acknowledge you. You do it too much and she may feel harassed considering her priorities. Love doesn't seem to be one of her priorities. If this woman doesn't see you in the future tense of her personal life why should you hold on? Don't hold on to this woman.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	it sound like she just got a  lot on her plate,but i would try to  email or text. her and let her know hw you feel.then let it  go and move on. it only been 2 months so it may just  she need time.|`|AA10221073	It is rude that she hasn't returned any of ur calls or emails.

I mean I sure she knows ur trying to contact her. If and whenever she calls just act as if it's no big deal anymore, act as if ur too busy to talk and move on to a woman who answers her pahone and email when u call or write.

vSQgKtZHaa	It sounds as though in your realisitic mind, you know this relationship isnt going to work, but emotionally you feel distraught at the thought of a life without him. Treat this as a grieving process, prepare yourself for the worst. Say goodbye when he goes and make it a clean cut. Allow yourself 3-5 days of sobbing, watching movies, eating chocolate, drinking champagne while listening to soppy music in a big bubble bath, whatever you need to mourn the break up. Then pick yourself up. Put away your photos of him, memorabilia etc. Delete his number.  Be nice to yourself. And move forward, strongly. Dont look back now. Dont call him. When youre ready, go out with girlfriends for drinks, enjoy being you, take note of what else is out there. Whatever you decide, good luck, i hope it brings you happiness.|`|LuO8cHkVaa	If a New Yorker is moving to Texas, he won't last long.

Its hard to let go to soembody youve had around you for a long time but if you dont love him, i think you should just let go. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and i am waiting for him to move to this city with me, i talk to him every day all the time, i trust him  and i truly love him, i dont have to ask myself if i would ever let him go because i know that i just cant do that no matter the distance.

What  was your resource that let you in on that he likes someone else? Was it the same friends, or some beyoches in your class that are tryin to hate on you? Keep tabs on that sh*t closely, cuz if you dont, chances are you'll miss your opportunity to catch his eye, because you will always be thinkin about who it is that he supposedly likes. I remember school allll to well, and I remember that your best friends are almost just the same as enemies....Heres a plan: If you like this dude, try to look at him frequently through your peripheral vision(not directly) to try and pick up what he might be concentrating on... if you are one of his focuses, you'll know quick, trust me! Then if you find out by YOUR OWN instincts, then start the M.F.P(major flirt process)..The rest will follow, either way. That always worked for me, over listening to anyone else.

011112b932219dbed9e42b9747827fbcaa	This is not from my personal life, but most guys who have a lot of self-confidence turn out to be jerks and(or) are full of themselves. I suppose my advice to a guy who is trying to display good self-confidence is to just be yourself and be proud to be you and don't let anyone tell you different.... that's the best way to go. As long as the guy is himself and isn't just trying to be a jerk so he can impress someone.  Basically it's fine, if he is trying to be something he isnt to try to get a girl... because then obviously she isn't the girl for him. A true relationship should be two people who like their gf or bf for who they are and not for someone in fake skin that is hiding their true personality. Unless he is really trying to go for the type of girl who likes the jerks who try hard to impress their peers..... if he really likes her and will do anything.. then go for it.... just know the ending is probably going to be ugly.|`|4bacf0c756a63b869d9cdfddaac25036aa	hey cried because i was crying...he was so confident in hisself that he didnt care if anyone teased him about it...and now he is like my favorite guy ever|`|GFZZnve3aa	My guy won me over by being above all the gossip going around school and not giving in to what people think is "hot" now|`|da7cc5b1b2095cf9292e4deb715dc158aa	being them self i know it kinda cliche but when a guy can come up to me casually and being himself it's a huge display of confidence because it shows that there comfortable with their self|`|3cM5AmWJaa	He was confidant around me.  He could be himself.  He joked with me, treated me like i was his best friend, and then would be kissing me and treating me like his girlfriend (which i was so it wasn't odd).  He wasn't afraid to hold me or my hand in front of his boys either.  He was just himself.  Most people, whether they're confidant or not, will find the people they can be confidant around.  But like I told another guy asking this question.  Just feel like you're good enough for yourself.  Don't feel like you have to be good enough or act a certain way for a girl.  It gives  you independence, and it sets you apart.  Something girls do like, i promise :].  good luck!
iQzyzq2aaa	Church.. maybe, call me crazy, but I think it might work.  But seriously, they have singles groups in most churches so if go to one church and don't like the "selection" of men there's always many more churches you can go to.  Actually, finding a good Christian guy is a lot easier than finding a good nonreligious guy, because they actually all hang out in the same place.|`|93bdec98c9da73bb964ad73115d4cf10aa	You should have had your parents arrange a marriage with somebody from birth so then they would have been notified and dragged church and encourage to stay a virgin then you might find hte guy you are looking for.   Otherwise...church.|`|AA11810119	go to www.singlechristian.com I think that's what it's called.|`|I1oFFDqIaa	A singles program at a church would be a good place to start.  The men there would be Christian by and large, and at least some of them would be virgins.  Keep your standards high, but realize that God might have different plans for you than you have for yourself.  And those might include a husband who is not a virgin, but a very strong and honorable Christian.  Let God lead your search for a mate.|`|JB613ytBaa	Don't laugh...but how about your Sunday School or Church.  Okay, a lot of preachers but not practicing...but there are still 10-20% if you find them 17-24 who are virgins.  They are there...try the Church of Christ, and the Baptists and some Methodists.  When I was in college, I new a few and that is where they hung out.  Also, alot of universities have the same church student groups on campuses.  Also, a good place to meet girl  and boys who are virgins.  (it never mattered to me, but good luck to you!)|`|FM2xephsaa	Wikipedia probably has a listing of imagined, fictional, fairy-tale like places. You should start with something like this. First figure out which imaginary mystical place of enchantment you fancy. Are you looking for a never-never land? Or more of a royal princess type fantasy?     Once you've figured it out, start doing your research looking for these places. You're bound to find this man in the fictional landscape you desire!|`|ZN7T7KS4aa	whats wierd if they were christian they should be virgins untill marrige|`|dYMjKFaUaa	Actually, I suggest counseling (you are going to hate this) because you've got to decide what is more important, Christian or virgin. You might find both, but if you are a Christian, you will relize that all people make mistakes and you can be forgiven. That's like, the key philosophy of Christianity. Talk to your pastor, and he will tell you are true Christian man will probably stay a virgin until marriage, but not all men find God before they lose their virginity, so you must not judge them by that. As to comparing you to other women, thats what the counseling is for. If he loves you, he wont, and you shouldn't worry so much.    As the the question, try purity programs where the man courts the woman with the father's permission. Christian programs will solve that requirment, and most will porbably be virgins. keep in mind, if you tell them it is a requirment that they have never had sex, they might lie to you.

Just respond, "Oh, if you needed something you could have called me." and don't say it sarcastically, say it with a smile.    Either one of two things will happen, you'll move on if it's not meant to be and everything will be cool, or two, HE is going to  come after you because YOU are playing "Hard to get" it's like a challenge and I know for a fact guys like Challenges XD|`|Utb9T5k0aa	Any guy that says i love you and then says that he doesnt care for you doesnt love you.

IUyVlirUaa	I wonder this same question too.  I am always told I'm "such a great guy".  But the only girls that ever randomly come and talk to me are ugly ones.  I don't get it!  My little brother (age 15) is ALWAYS getting girls.  They always ask him to hang out and he hardly knows them.  They're way hot, but he's too judgmental and finds faults that aren't even there.    I guess that the reason he gets girls is that maybe he's more attractive than me, more approachable than me, or maybe the girls take pity on him because he is often quieter than me.  I don't get it!|`|P8WAKaWBaa	Maybe you don't need that...smile but if you approach them why should they approach you some girls don't like that say like girl like me...later just wait and you go talk to them|`|75cbfe43ec6da58bcdf3f550e616b471aa	LOL same as me, If i had ten bucks for every chick that said something to the effect of " your the best guy i've ever met" i'd be a millionaire. Just because you are awesome, doesnt mean they have a deeper, attraction to you. Either physical or emotional. Your also in the age of niave,self absorbed women. Women typically from 18-30 want the bad guys, because they have a belief they can fix them. although they never can. Unless they have kids most women from that age group won't date a good guy. Simply because there not ready to settle down and just want some action if you know what i mean. Also most women foolishly will not make the first move. Its very stupid and some women swear by it. They think its a mans job to approach the woman. Which sadly most women still believe.|`|baFaaxGeaa	Because you are a chode.|`|8909f858dc9ad09f4dc69b2a3801b7bdaa	because those gurls are the high maintence type and if you are a nice guy then you need a nice gurl thats the way i look at it|`|F4l4FLMRaa	It might be that they are intimidated by you.

Make a joke that will crack everyone up. Don't just approach them suddenly and introduce yourself cause that will make you look desperate and stupid. Most of the time, girls will look the other direction when you do that. You can also somehow stand next to a girl and relate to something she's doing. By this, just act casual and normal as if it's like a short conversation. A little humor could help too.
rlSj7VBJaa	Although it may be really hard the best thing to do is to just tell him you only want to be friends.

That simple...on the other hand, you could tell the straight truth, which may hurt a little bit more." I like someone else...not u." Either works...Good Luck!
CnuwupbOaa	The problem is that he's unsure about you and you're unsure about him. The both of you are making mirror moves in the same game, therefore there's no progress leaning towards that you like each other. He's fearful that if he comes on to you in that manner, he feels that you'll reject him and lose friendship as well. I presume you feel the same?    Don't be confused, make it all clear. Now would be the best time to kiss him at that party. You don't even have to explain you just need to act. He likes you, wants you to be his girlfriend, and wants you to come to his party for sure. You already have an amazing friendship, well what better relationship than to have close friends from the start.|`|208888e7fd8ea888065a1c3f145b7dc0aa	he obviously likes u. and he probably acting weird because ur giving a vibe u dont like him.    tell him, and quit playing games. hate chicks like that.|`|Y4CMta9zaa	These things are always extremely hard.  Why?  What you said, the fear of rejection.    Everyone is afraid of rejection, but if you don't risk it, you will always regret not knowing.      If you are both mature about it, you should try dating him for a while.  Ask him out.  I bet he's feeling like he was already rejected too, since he made a move (put his head on your shoulder, asked to kiss you) and you basically said no.  And saying "I'm not sure" or "i'm confused" is basically the same thing to a guy as saying "No" or "No, but lets be friends."     good luck.

If you are in the mall, ask her opinion about what shirt, pants, shoes, tie, whatever would go with whatever.  I know I enjoy helping a guy with matching clothes.  From there, compliment her good taste and start a conversation.  By her response, you will know if she is interested or not.  If she responds favorably, good for you.  If not, maybe she is married or already has a boyfriend.  Just march on down the road until you find another girl with whom you are attracted.|`|GljqxAb7aa	First, try not to look desperate or creepy....say "Hi" and see how she responds or reacts...then you will know what to say...

I've found this way is a much easier way for me to talk to guys and pick up guys/ them pick me up then being at the mall.

Um, like myspace, hi5, friendster, dating sites, sites for penpal, and um... forums, oh yeah and places like Yahoo! Answer. :)    Sign up then start searching and asking. Voila, and u get friends! :)|`|7IO245Jhaa	You can try on line chat rooms for your age group..  Yahoo, MSN and Aol have some..  Check them out !|`|15YkiBFaaa	You could go to friendly sites where you can meet other people who share the same interests as you like Storywrite.com where writers can meet other writers. It's a safe site and there's rules where you can't do inappropriate stuff on it..there's a public chat where you can talk to other people from different places. But that's if you're a writer.     Other ways you can find friends outside of the country is to write letters to people in third-world countries. Maybe like a pen pal. I did it once with my class and it was pretty fun. You could do those charity things and get to know more people that way. There's myspace and tagged where you can meet other people that way although I'm not very sure if it's that safe. Have fun!
82p3COoaaa	I think she is making it pretty clear that she does not want to be anything more than friends.|`|DYcqtio4aa	I think she doesn't believe in love. Though as a person she may have sexual needs and wants.  She likes you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  That's why your in the friend zone. Like you said the guy she is now with it's just a sexual thing.  I think it wouldn't work out if you to were together.   I myself would prefer to be with a guy I didn't emotionally care to much for.   Then hurt one I care about.  I say hurt because when one has given up on love.  Having a relationship with a guy like you who cares about her.  One will just end up hurting him without wanting to.  That she doesn't want to use you like she does him.  Means she cares for you, even if it is just as a friend.|`|ff99c8a6eb38b6e93c5c388cf223a304aa	Please... sunshine??? Maybe you are in love with idea of being in-love. Sounds like you are not what she is looking for physically. So my advise is to cut yourself off from being her "friend" and tell her straight out that you were starting to get feelings for her so its best for you to find someone who is available. And that she is not and you don't want to waste any more time. You are looking for someone that is available and that can love you. Once you find that then you will actually find the light. Good luck!|`|bocujnngaa	awwww...if only all guys were that sincere. You need to leave her, you sound like a really great guy. Don't fool around and play her little games. There are lots of girls that would appreciate you the way you deserve it.|`|tTnX75Eiaa	she doesnt want feelings to re-surface????  its obvious she needs u as a friend, period.  u asked 4 that and she gave it to u.  if u were hoping 4 something to happen, u might end up waiting 4 ever.  either accept and respect her wishes by being good friends or if u cant handle it....keep a distance and look 4 some1 else. the sun rises every day, u'll get another miss sunshine. sorry cant put it 4 u less painful than|`|AA11706931	to me it sounds like she wants to fool around but have a Plan B  a.k.a. you. i wouldnt hold my breath for her if i were you. go out and find someone dont wait on her. i know things are great with her but you can surely find someone better who wont string you along.|`|5c79386baa74ae9aa4019e5aea288a76aa	o dude its going to be hard to say this but if she left you to go with this other dude over sex then your screwed, its happened to me before and it sucks, i just say try to move on....|`|15YkiBFaaa	I'm sorry to say this but forget that woman. If you're saying you don't need or want her, then ignore her and move onto someone else. She's only manipulating what you got. There's other of women in the world who are better. This sounds harsh but she was the one who treated you harshly. It sounds like she doesn't even care for you too even though she would deny that part. Unconfuse your heart and find a woman with better morals and a kinder heart.|`|h1AxpMCvaa	Some women believe that it takes 4 guys to make the perfect man:    A man who's understanding & there for emotional support.  A man who's great at fixing things.  A man who's hell on wheels in bed.      and  A man who pays for everything.    Which one seems to fit you best right now?    My advice would be, if love is what you're looking for, stay friends with her but try to find someone new. Good luck.|`|5VHYmdE1aa	you are the best guy i have met on this yahoo questions so far. what shes doing to you is wrong. shes playing you bad. she wants her cake and eat it too. shes playing the feild or so it sounds like and knows if none of it works out their is always you because she thinks you will wait on her. thats what it sounds like to me. i am sorry this is hurting you and i am sure she is aware of it. if she had any sense she would jump all over you and leave the other guys alone. there is a couple of ways you can approach this. you can give her a reason she wont leave and you finally say i had enough and walk away. but if you do that maybe she will realize what she had. this is a really tough situation for you and i am sorry you are hurting. sometimes we dont know what we have until we loose it. and maybe this is what she needs to experience. good luck to you|`|pjhXnU2iaa	firstly why did you start dating her when you knew her ex was in the picture? That is so wrong. She is a player and a whore. I can't believe men/women get sucked into that crap. Why would you want to be with her anyway when there are heaps of genuine lovely girls out there. Kick her to the kerb growup and have some time on your own to work out what you want in a relationship.|`|O9IGl0Abaa	Shes your sunshine yet your relationship is very cloudy. Co-dependency is whats steering this situation.  Your friend is extremely selfish and she knows that youll always be there with open arms and a listening ear.  Shes clearly pulled you in with her beguiling words.  You mean as much to her as she needs you in that moment when shes needy for your friendship. She has no intentions of considering you to be her lover. Start looking out for your own emotional well-being by weaning yourself away from her. Keep in mind that she probably has a few esteem issues that is causing her to go back and forth with you and her ex and what ever other guy that walks in front of her.  Shes not your partnera Userbut no your partner.    PS Anticipating that shell somehow realize that youre that guy thats always there is a complete waste of your time.  If you want to test out how sincere she is dont call her for a few days and see what happens.  Shell call you at least twice then her calls will fall offyoull be better off with out a friend like her.

Lo mera mente importante es saber cual es tu mal.  El remedio esta en la voluntad que quieras poner para solucionar tu problema.  Necesitas mucha disiplina, sobre todo en tus habitos alimenticios, recurre a un nutriologo, visita ademas a un medico endocrinologo para que te valore en lo relacionado a tus glandulas y tus niveles de glucosa.  Por favor pideles que te indiquen una rutina de ejercicios adecuada a tu masa corporal.  Y sobre todo no pierdas la esperanza de llegar a tener logros.  Todo lleva tiempo, pero es muy gratificante ver los resultados.  No hagas las dietas por tu cuenta sin supervicion medica profesional.

viva comparandote con alguien mas delgado porque se ve mejor o por que es mas linda o tiene una cinturita toda la infancia y parte de la adolecencia sufri de esto de las burlas de los apodos que hasta mi propio hermano me ponia, con el tiempop y despues de mucho esfuerso baje de peso y me veia genial  comenze a ser mas extrobertida porque en verdad que era timida, comenze a tener muchos amigos pero justo en la prepa conoci a una amiga que la verdad ha sido obesa toda su vida y apesar de esto es una mujer muy fuerte la cual admiro muchisimo pues se tiene tanto amor propio como la mas delgada y lida y la verdad se le nota tanto su seguridad que ha tenido galanes guapisimos locos por ella se  lleba de lujo con todos nuestros excompa?eros de la escuela era una de las ni?as mas populares de la escuela y en cada esquina se paraba a saludar a alguien, as que me di cuenta que los problemas que te creas  son solo eso creasiones de nuestra mente , si tu te sientes segura de ti misma se nota y si tu te quieres y te valoras por lo que eres una persona con defectos pero tambien virtudes entonces eso te ayuda dicen que para ver algo hay que creer que existe, lei una terapia que dice que para obtener algo primero se empieza por imitar, puedes imitar que de verdad te quieres que te cuidas que te respetas y poco a poco se va hacendo costumbre y en un tiempo veras que  si tu te quieres todos alrededor te van a querer y respetar, claro  si te hacen algo defiendete o nadie lo va a hacer porti , no te dejes y sobre todo valorate porque aqui todos somos iguales ok.|`|Ib8uLSTCaa	oye calmate

se burlan no vale la pena que las tomes en cuenta,ya que con su actitud solo estan demostrando su pobreza de espiritu y valores y sus burlas no hacen mas si no confirmar que actuan asi por que en el fondo viven llenos de complejos por alguna razon,y con sus burlas quieren sentirse perfectos,siendo que no existe perfeccion completa,por el momento animo,ponte sexy y mira en el internet el mejor maquillaje y ropa que te venga mejor,,,por que no hay mujer fea,si no mal arreglada,y lo que te puede pasar es que al sentirte rechazada acudas a la comida como una fuente de escape,tu tranquila y saca partido de lo mejor que tengas,ya sea tu piel o tus ojos y destaca eso en tu arreglo personal,crea tu propio estilo,y poco a poco puedes conseguir lucir mejor de lo mejor,por que gorditas sexys si que las hay,despues prueba y encuentra algun video de ejercisios que sean de tu agrado,mira que hay para todos gustos y condiciones,vivimos en una epoca maravillosa en la que se conoce de muchos videos que an ayudado a muchas personas a verse y sentirse mejor,prueba y estaras mejor que nunca,exiaten muchos,,,aerobics,zumba,Tae-Bo,etc sigue para delante lucha por lo que eres,por esas cualidades que dios te a dado y sumale las que tu puedes darle,animo estamos contigo,cuidate y cuentanos como te va,gracias por compartir con nosotros tu sentir y felicidades por no quedarte con eso,esa es una prueba de otra cualidad mas que tienes tu valentia...Saludos y espero que mis palabras te sean de gran ayuda,,,cuentas conmigo y con todos los

Tampoco quiero  decir que todo lo que hacemos este mal, simplemente a veces no encaja con el grupo donde estamos.    A travs del lenguaje, de las respuestas que damos y en la forma que las damos, actitudes que pueden ser agresivas, terminamos por quedarnos solos sin prisa pero sin pausa.

No te quedes en ese circulo vicioso del pensar solo porque, intenta buscarle una salida con ayuda y con alguien que sea absolutamente objetivo, no de tu entorno, aunque preguntes a los mas cercanos que ven ti que este mal, pero tambien cave la posibilidad de los otros  tengan que reveer algunas cuestiones personales, no es todo tuyo el problema.

Para que eso no ocurra,  la persona, hombre o mujer, debe de estar preparada para la vida; y ms la mujer teniendo en cuenta que suele depender ms de un hombre que al contrario. Hay que estudiar..al menos un poco, y prepararse para un trabajo lo mejor posible. Si  lo consigues, n es dificil que vayas haciendo amigos y amigas que, aunque se vayan emparejando, siempre te quede alguien con quien compartir tu tiempo. Pero tambin hay que saber estar sola-o, y si te has preparado ese poco de que hablbamos, pues lo seguirs haciendo, seguiras leyendo libros, o aprenders otro idioma, o seguirs un curso de capacitacin y perfeccionamiento en tu actividad....y as seguiras conociendo gente cada vez ms preparada, y aprenders a no aburrirte cuando ests sola; a parte de que sola nunca ests, ests con tus pensamientos, que son estupendos si son positivos, .  Adems, si te quedas as...sers carnaza para los hombres, te irs con cualquiera con el fn de tener una oportunidad de hacer pareja, y tampoco es eso., pues fracasars facilmente; si no elijes, si no tienes un criterio para elegir pareja, no sers felz nunca....,ms vale sola que mal acompa?ada.

b6231fc863ba37edd507c68be43f0768aa	I would say she likes you but is probably hesitant because of your age difference. Be honest to her and just tell her how u feel. She may be worried about how people see her if she is dating a younger guy.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	She comes across to me as a little shy I'll admit. If she's singling you out like you say she could very well be interested in you. At the age you two are at the eight year difference really doesnt matter. Go ahead and ask her for a date and don't worry about looking bad! If she says no, oh well right?     I hope this helped, good luck!|`|3PTmOhY0aa	Sound's like love to me dude, if she really does this (and you aren't exagerating) then I'd ask her I don't think age should be a problem at all|`|87492ca7c651f2902e5f1bf683b7067aaa	she is intrested in you but she is worried about the age difference. she likes you but she doesn't know if you like her because of the huge age difference|`|KpGMkz5Saa	She probably likes you, but she might have a boyfriend or a kid or something.
bmHbNipGaa	If i truly liked her,and if she was special to me,i would tell her,because i wouldn't let pride get in the way of me and the woman i love.Then again,i wouldn't break up with my girlfriend.|`|W7BZcdynaa	I would tell her. Pride is overrated. I have nothing to lose from it.|`|kVH9TyWraa	Well, I would tell her I regretted breaking up with her but some other guys' pride would get in the way|`|5UpAgCxGaa	i would definitely tell her.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	When it comes to love and pride I choose love. Pride just gets me hurt most of the time and I'd rather have someone else back in my life than feel all machismo just to go to bed at night realizing I'm all alone. When I'm wrong I'm wrong, I'd tell her!     Anywho I hope this helps!
8762a7ad72c671613edaaa6df2a64976aa	first if you hate your ex delete all traces of him, including the email address that he must have to be able to request web cam. Second, them being friends isn't going to be easy for you so dint expect it to be, this situation will almost certainly be hard at times and not fun to deal with. Consider all your options first this may ruin your relationship with your current boyfriend|`|bgRejNWdaa	Never let that happen girl|`|swsAcnvnaa	Friends is one thing, I would never stop a friend from being friends with anyone even if I didn't like them but if it goes into more then I would be a little upset if she didn't talk to me first.  The question you should be asking yourself is do you still have feelings for him other then dislike as you say. I do not think it would bother you so much if you didn't have any feelings and if you do you need to re-examine what you have.|`|XJq2fUkyaa	NO, if your new boyfriend realy cares about you he wouldn't want to be friends with your ex, and your ex only told you he loves you to see if it would get you to take your top off, he was using you.  My advice would be to get rid of both of them and start over with someone new.|`|UZmlHckeaa	never let that happen,never!|`|q7sjKgAnaa	I WOULD BE
hwVYB84Haa	If each of you stay at your own side of your computer it will be safe!|`|9Yf6JnVxaa	You don't know- hold on to identifying information. If you get to the point where you would like to meet- have friends with you for the first few times and meet at safe places. Also talk on the phone first- before meeting- it helps you know the person a little more.|`|Nujhn412aa	u wont ever know.. it can b safe.. or can b extremely dangerous.. b careful always, all ways .. better to b safe than sorry.|`|gtkSkyX3aa	You don't.|`|30df9097f03d1c8888f9bbc610068367aa	Well there really is no way to know if it is actually safe. There are so many ways for people to hide their identity online. Just remember to give out information that is identifying..... like exactly what school you go to, where you live, where you hang out, bank information, etc.|`|Akttg5h0aa	you don't know if one is safe.|`|Cja9UCQMaa	Knowing usernames / passwords and using a keylogger. that's about it. =P
c0fb938503879cb7e7430d982942ce60aa	Hola como estas, mirala manera mas te podria decir que efeciva sera llegar al corazn y s que solo tu puedes hacerlo ya que la conoces a la perfeccin y sabes cuales y como son los gstos de su corazn, pero bueno vamos tambien puedes hacer cosas diferentes hace como si fueran recien novios tu puedes nimo!!!|`|240208241377d3ab04e004745d2d9201aa	Pues si los dos lo quieren intentar, adelante. Pero est difcil volver a sentir confianza, as que les recomiendo que vayan a terapia de pareja cuando vuelvan, les puede ayudar mucho y entender por qu los miedos y el enojo.  Si se esperan pueden generar un resentimiento muy grande.  Suerte.
cV2d9cBBaa	Vente pa mi casa y veras como tienes orgasmos d 2 en 2|`|WORcHrt2aa	porke cuando tu estas arriba llevas el control del movimiento, y parte ke se estimula mas tu clitoris, y nos sentimos realizados cuando las vemos llegar a us orgasmo, nos encanta verlas como lo disfrutan, nos excitan mas!!!!!!!!|`|PvqX0cXNaa	Monica que te digo, en cuestion de la posicin tu controlas el movimiento el ritmo en una palabra tu controlas la relacin.  En cuanto dices que si es obligatorio sentir el orgasmo te digo que toda relacin sexual que tengas es con el fin de sentir eso tan rico y delicioso, ya que si no lo obtienes tiendes a sentirte frustrada y a la larga tendras un malestar. En relacin a que sentimos nosotros cuando una mujer tiene un orgasmo, te digo que para m en lo personal es una satisfaccin por que lo que hace uno con su pareja se culmina a lo grande y obtiene su premio, se comienza a sentir calientito y un cosquilleo riquisimo tanto que uno tambien lo disfruta.|`|2a05ab95814eb28ef37922630177eb5aaa	que cosa es "posision"  ???|`|kUOmNroRaa	Mmmmhh... calentito... (qu rico)|`|hpFYr6Qaaa	Pues claro cuando tu estas arriba tu te mueves de manera que te gusta llevas el ritmo que te gusta mientras tu novio abajo no hace nada yo creo que el que le tiene que hechar ganas aqui es tu galan por hacerte sentir algo cuando te penetra yo creo que es iportante que los dos tengan un orgasmo aunque en ocaciones no se pueda y por ello no se tiene que condenar a ninguno suerte y que tengas muchos orgasmos de hoy en adelante...|`|189e955af993664ea2e90712c88d02b4aa	por no le dices a tu novio que te haga el sexo oral .. tambien es muy exitante.. ok|`|J97vav4qaa	No tiene nada de malo.   Lo nico que pasa es que en otra posicin no toca o rosa la misma zona erogena o no la estimula correctamente como en la posicin que si sientes el orgasmo  Recuerda que las zonas erogenas no en todos y todas son las mismas y no en todas las zonas te exitas con la misma antenacidas|`|ORP4jR9Faa	es posible que en la posicin en la que tu al cansas el orgasmo  el estimule tus sonas erojenas  podrias pedirle a tu pareja que explore  tu cuerpo  y varen de posiciones  y encontraran alguna otra   para nosotros los hombres el que tu pareja alcanse un orgasmo es una sensacional de  satisfaccin pues es la confirmacin de que podemos ser buenos amantes  el no llevar a una mujer puede convertirse en un problema|`|rOSFJwvGaa	No es obligatorio, pero es mas placentero para ambos el saber que satisfaces a tu pareja. Tanto tu a el, como el a ti. Habla con tu pareja , yo soy de la idea de que con tu pareja todo se vale!!!!|`|5AkHUJ9Iaa	sencillamente los cuerpos, los puntos de excitacion, los movimientos, y la posicion son relativamente cambiantes para cada tipo de mujer, en la posicion que tu dices se estimula mas el clitoris y el pene tiende en los movimientos a rozar el punto g, cuando estan en otra posicion, la respuesta es obvia, el no se mueve bien porque tu no le dices como te gusta y probar para que aprendan mucho de las demas que son espectaculares, en cuanto al orgasmo masculino es lo mejor lo digo como hombre es mas satisfactorio cuando la pareja llega al mismo tiempo.|`|bSSgjLsOaa	para mi como hombre me gusta que mi pareja llegue al orgasmo porque es como la culminacion de un muy BUEN SEXO y se siente como si te fueras al cielo con todo y zapatos|`|DU8EfKjYaa	solo relajate y lo lograras de todas formas.....no te aceleres..  suerte.|`|qn50xPg4aa	CHICA APRENDE A DOMINAR TODAS LAS POSES INTENTA MOVERTE CUANDO ESTAS ABAJO-DE ESPALDAS- EN 4 - CONTRA LA PARED--- ETC. ETC. BUENO NUNCA ACABARIA TRATA DE DOMINAR TU TODOS LOS CAMPOS Y VERAS Q NO SOLO DE UNA MANERA LO SENTIRS BIEN... PONTE EN PRACTICA Y LO LOGRARAS    ross|`|oVCojNEXaa	que importa la posicin siempre y cuando tengas un orgasmo adems arriba  vos tenes el control|`|240208241377d3ab04e004745d2d9201aa	porque Mnica, t ests controlando el movimiento. Parece que cuando l se mueve t no ests sintiendo como deberas, a lo mejor necesitan platicar ms de esto para que l aprenda a ver qu te gusta.  suerte.|`|BjW4AVuOaa	hola, bueno vamos por partes, no tiene nada de malo que solo en esa posicion alcances el orgasmo, creeme hay mujeres que no saben ni que es, pero no es obligatorio sentirlo, para nada, y en lo personal yo siento los espasmos cuando mi pareja tiene un orgasmo, aparte del de lubricante que expulsa, de esa manera me doy cuenta, espero te tranquilices respecto a ese asunto, saludos.|`|GOAjLOHqaa	uui kisiera ser tuuu !!! jajaja a mi galan le enkanta ke yo este arriba... y kreeme ke a mi me duele mas! asi ke no me gusta! prefiero ke el este arribita de mi =)|`|gT6IdQkQaa	Totalmente de acuerdo con aquellas personas que comentaron acerca de la estimulacion de las zonas erogenas, en forma primordial la del clitoris. Creo acertado el consejo de que debe l explorarte mas para poder entender las variantes en las posiciones, los angulos de inclinacion y la fuerza e intensidad con que debe hacerse.  Cuando mi pareja llega al orgasmo es como abrir el cielo, por ello soy fanatico del multiorgasmo femenino.|`|N9p0W9sjaa	No es obligatorio sentir el orgasmo pero es mejor, es muy cierto que al estar tu arriba tu controlas el movimiento y por ello te sea mas facil conseguir el orgasmo pero no debe ser la unica. Yo creo debes hablar con tu novio y probar otras formas pero no solo hacerlas y ya, aveces puede llegar a ser mas un bloqueo emocional... solo la platica, la confianza y a base de prueba y error encontraras mas formas de llegar al orgasmo...|`|x64ESfCqaa	por que te falta ms exitacin, en todas la posiciones se puede llegar a un orgasmo siempre y cuando este muy exitada. y si cuando ustedes tienes un orgasmo se contrae la vagina y es mas placer para nosotros.   yo dira que los pasos a seguir son  1.- coqueteo, juegos detalle  2.- besos, caricias, masajes mas besos, mas caricias con muchos amor o cari?o  3.- orgasmos, muchos orgasmos  4.- relajacin abrazos, besos y ternura   pero sobretodo mucha exitacin para amar rico|`|R64FjKCDaa	todas las mujeres se pueden tener orgasmos en cualquier posicin pero en tu-caso puede ser que tu no te prestes ono te acomodes o cuando el este arriba tu le digas mas al ritmo que tu sientas extaso yo creo que solo asi podrs tener un orgasmo por posicin y no es obligatorio es necesario para que tu relacin sea perfecta y al os hombres nos sadifacsion que una mujer tenga no uno barios bueno en mi caso as de ve de ser.
xm7kFnfNaa	Well, I'm attracted to girls who can take care of themselves and actually have a direction in life. Whether it be dreams, aspirations or an ultimate goal.|`|AA11810496	im a girl so i dont like girls im not bi
5b8b7cce0826bcf89ac433dbb1ccc44eaa	Because they are attractive.    Next question.|`|c86cf3d1884d05ac95aee7198929f6dbaa	because they are fake and easier to take to bed|`|eg2IVVUlaa	Not all guys need to have that type of person. It may seem that way but many want a good loving and caring like minded person.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	They don't. I for one like women with meat on their bones over the stugly (stick + ugly) women like Paris Hilton. So go non-pencil thin women! Woot!|`|BGurXG8Yaa	We can't generalize things this way on the basis of 2-3 cases.. Everyone has their own choice and they like people that way.|`|0hgZcHqsaa	not all guys do, MOST of us actually want a girl with some meat on her bones.  It's just those skinny girls you see give it up easier, so they get guys often.  But those guys you don't want unless you just want to be used.  Maybe you should be looking in the right places and for the right guys.  Skin and bones is just sickly if you ask me.|`|SFQ1i4OPaa	Because appearance is everything. What you see is what you get... although that make not be true, we want what looks good upon first glance. That all changes once you actually meet the person and start talking to them more in depth.|`|QudRuqjKaa	Because your mind is narrow minded. They don't but go for them because most are frickin retarded and super easy. You can **** them like prostitutes. Trust me, guys like full figured fit women with a confident personality. They are intimidated by those types though because most guys are douche bags.
AA10247071	It is in the way you are thinking about yourself.  Boys find you attractive, size doesn't make all the difference.  Try to see yourself in a more positive way and don't be afraid to see yourself as desirable.|`|7e4f3a720b78a9ee4fba84fdc6e474c9aa	I think that maybe guys are picking up on your feeling. If you are uncomfortable, they can sense it. Try being more confident in yourself. Who do you think a guy is going to be interterested in, the girl that is standing back a corner to shy to talk. Or the girl that is out there in the middle of the crowd, talking, laughing, and having a good time? Get yourself out there. Show some confidence. The guys will see this.      I hope this helps you. Good luck.|`|2Isgpjiaaa	because you don't get out there....try being sociable for at least a day and see how it feels. i know you will have lots of fun.|`|K6lBjK2Caa	Don't worry, you'll find someone.    Guys can be jerks and judge on appearance. You don't want someone like that.|`|hAJJOuuyaa	I've never had a real boyfriend either. I can't answer why you've never gotten one but maybe you should try being less shy around boys. Be more open and fun so they want to get to know you. Try being friends with more guys, it might work. :)|`|FTO4Rnxsaa	because you had never tried to know anyone closely god has made a partner for everyone and one more thing don't dis-bielieve anyone untill you know it well|`|0ZA2V8ohaa	I've never had a boyfriend either and sometimes i tend to as myself why. It's really hard to be patient and wait for somebody to come along. Even though I'm a senior in highschool and have never gone out on a date; I dont lose hope. Don't worry  there is infact somebody out there for you. If you want the process of getting a boyfriend to speed up you should get out of your shell, join clubs, and other activities so you can meet someone. Also dont be self concious about your size. There are many men who are attracted to large women. So you shouldnt worry too much I'm sure you'll find somebody.|`|c86cf3d1884d05ac95aee7198929f6dbaa	because you haven't looked in the right places. try making new friends and getting to know more people. your shines might make it worse to meet new people, but when u try to be social, you help stop your shyness|`|b9a1f9997a3e751a12c661485452507aaa	How old are you?     I'm 18 aaand I've never had a "real" boyfriend. A few in junior high..but nothing that even counts. In high school I was always waay taller than guys and smarter than most of em too. [[6'1.5" by the way]]. I'm also not skinny so I think I'm just scary. lol. I have the same doubts sometimes that maybe there isn't someone for me..    My friends all tell me to work on my self confidence. Aaand for me that means going on walks, eating better, working out at the gym and taking better care of myself. I'm still not skinny, but I have soo much more confidence. Believe me, the guys notice.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	Well Deb, dating puzzles all of us. Just try putting yourself out there a little more. I myself am skinny but women don't take me seriously as I'm commonly stereotyped as a joker. I use humor to get to know women but after that I got nothing. So just mkae yourself look very attractive, love yourself, and take the initiative after guys! I'm sure you'll find someone eventually. you can do it!|`|fdef5b7f8db228402d8aa2bdd8329c0aaa	I think you don't give the people who are giving you attention a chance( you want what you want and nothing else) Look around you communicate make guy friends and you'll find a BF.
42ec72dde8f53d6810e2b4f337a281bdaa	You'll find one.  Girls get better with age.  Most girls are catty and weird in high school.  I had to deal with that too.  I found my lifelong girlfriends in college.  We don't let anyone or anything get in between us.  Finding a good girlfriend is like finding a good boyfriend.  It takes time as well as trial and error.  Once you find a best friend you'll know it.|`|1d4b10950077343727e09fc6c9511961aa	i have four of my best friends that are exactly how you described, but i have also had friends that back stab me, and all i can say to you is that its those friends who really show you who your real friends are.  you'll find a nice gurl to be your best friend soon!!!!!!!    =)|`|wNFpeId8aa	Trust me I know how it is. i would be there, thats me but... we dont know each other =(    Good luck =)|`|lcKjQo2maa	This is not a dating service. Sounds like you need to spend more time with your mom. Mom's love to do those things with their daughters. Or are you looking for a wife? Are you gay? Most girls have a great deal of interest in guys and most of us love the attention they give us, and I would do the normal thing, and drop you to go have fun with one of them. Not anything personal, its just I would rather be with a guy than a girl almost anytime. Good Luck|`|2QJbKdLNaa	I FELT the same way to, youll meet her, i am sure it took me a week. I saw her at the mall and she had some cool shoes and said where did you get them. we exchanged numbers and everything. Its like searching for a cd but much harder and funner. Hope you can find a special friend in no time. =]|`|MjX3id60aa	it sounds like you are still young,  as you get older so won't the maturity level of your friends.  But I can guarantee at some point your best friend will always talk behind your back, we are a society of gossips.|`|AA11310070	It just takes time.  You can help by not letting them borrow your clothes/jewlery|`|2d346a590e07b8c34545c8877ee0b8b0aa	Yes, I do. And I only have ONE true friend and that's all I need. I have other associates but if anything happens she will stay by your side.    I'm assuming you want information on a true friend. Most true friends are from when you were young (I got my friend when I was eight.) Ironically, most people's true friends are completely different than they are in terms of personality. That is true for my friend too. But still there is this instant click. Also, true friends don't fight a lot. I never had a serious fight with my friend since the third grade. And, with a true friend, there is usually that inside thing--a thing like a joke that no one understands besides the both of you. And they never, ever, ever tell your secrets.    Somewhere is a true friend out their for you. To find her you have to look.

xm7kFnfNaa	Be patient. You don't want to go rushing into something that might get you gurt!
fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	uh im not sure what playstation has 2 do w/ anything. but if u dont want 2 ruin it...dont rush him. when he is ready, he will make the leap.|`|fe1dfdd37b530e8fa0f383b682cfd855aa	hmmm sounds interestin|`|AA10214838	Well you really answered your own question.  He's not ready or wanting to be in a commited relationship.  Don't pursue it.  Don't continue to try to create a "relationship" with someone who doesn't want.  You will only end up hurt in the long run.
AA10405115	We are having a strong crush, aren't we, young lady?  Well, I agree with the first answerer - no one beyond your league. Believe that you are the best, you deserve the best.  Coming to the issue, there are a few things that will make your life difficult if you wish to get him:  1. You don't meet him in person - its almost impossible to work out a relationship without being in touch with each other personally.  2. He doesn't have feelings for you - probably doesn't even think about you. You are just a casual friend.  3. There are a lot of girls around him - Do you want someone to be a priority for you when you are not even an option for them?  If you wish so, you can work on building that internet friendship, meet up some time, try to hang out together and go on like that but its almost certain that you will end up emotionally destroyed because the chances of success are almost non-existent.  So, don't you think its better to get rid off that crush? Don't let that thought grow big enough to harm you. Remember that the world is big and there are so many big fish in the sea.   As a starter, block him from your messenger for the time being. Also, don't go online when you know he too will be there. Keep yourself busy with other things, good friends, music, sports or whatever you like. Give yourself time to forget him.   Next time, don't fall for someone whom you can't meet up in person.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	Honey, first and foremost NO man is out of your league. When you start thinking like that you eliminate most chances you have for growth and aopportunity. So don't defeat yourself before you start!     I'd just move on. If you're just an internet buddy you're just a net friend. I'd recommend moving on before your crush gets any stronger.
ZKIaDXuwaa	First of all, you shouldn't have very low self-esteem because you're different. I'm different too, so often at school I'm alone (but not lonely) and am occasionally left out. No one at school teases me though, although there is a possibility that they talk about me behind my back, which is quite a possibility. I understand why you would want to have friends. Everyone needs to belong in some sort of little group, so yeah, reach out and try to make friends. Join clubs and stuff.Be careful though. There's a lot of people out there who just use other people until they get what they want and then they just abandon them (and I'm not just talking about guys and dating and stuff). Also, it must suck that your mom doesn't listen to you. Please embrace your uniqueness and be yourself, that way you'll know that the people who are around you truly do like you as a friend.|`|AA11069634	I'm an old man, but I do have something to say.    This just seems to be the case with High School.  It gets so much better in college or after High School.      I'm sorry that this is making you unhappy.  It's most important that you don't change yourself to fit into what other people think you should be.  What you are is just fine.      Your uniqueness and ability to think independently will soon become what makes you interesting to other people....after these "other people" grow up and realize how interesting people can be when they aren't all doing the same thing to fit in.    You have a unique point of view.  You can see things differently than other people.  You sometimes walk a different path.  You have the ability to understand your faults and do something about it.   In the world after High School these are wonderful attributes.    You are a wonderful person and thank God you are interesting.    I know my answer isn't a "tip" to make friends, but also think that it's not number of friends you have, but what kind of friendships you develop.  I'm certain you are going to meet many interesting people in your lifetime.|`|bVLWVonUaa	Look, I don't really fit in at school either. The kids at my school don't tease me or anyhting like that but still, were not necessarily friends. It's more like "I leave you alone you leave me alone''. But you know your young right now and life can have so much in store for you. Your only in high school you still have so much ahead of you. Sometimes you won't necessarily find any friends in school but you have to realize that thats okay. Also a lot of the kids probably won't even be friends anymore after high school. The friendships that count are the ones that last for a lifetime. Would you rather have 1,000 friends that don't really like you or one friend that would die for you? Try to branch out do different things and meet different people. If nothing happens don't be discouraged. I heard that college gets better. As hard as it seems you might just have to wait for something to happen.|`|2jcbRcI0aa	sometimes i dont feel like i fit in either...but i go to church and i have alot of fiends there...try makeing friends in other places besides school...
CnuwupbOaa	Well, you can still speak with her. You need to calm down first and do it without hesitating. The more you do it the more comfortable you'll feel. She's not going to look into your eyes and figure you all out. It's good to build social relationship and have her well acquainted with you at least if you're not dating her, but have an interest.|`|57e61931a9d704652ea4f4bbd93bad4eaa	call her|`|ca02ef42e638eed47881935f3e7b87efaa	Go out!  It's Saturday night - and leave the phone at home.|`|AA10249071	Play Snood.    www.snood.com  or  Write her a nice love letter and go shopping for her (get her little treats and gifts)|`|642519fb2cde8724ed1c4aba80250cd6aa	You need to keep very busy. I go 2 days without talking to my sweety and it's very hard. But if I feel stressed about it, I write him a letter. He knows he is ALWAYS in my thoughts.|`|9b9e99a6ce44ae131c2bd937da6d180daa	Find something to do .|`|eVbV5bExaa	it's tough to deal with something like that. listen to some music, watch t.v., random stuff.   But honestly i don't think any of it would work because since you love her, how can your mind be distracted form her?|`|y5wT6Tzoaa	AHHH damn thats why i'm on here awnsering questions!!! lol just try to keep yourself too busy to think about it.|`|393678a71b7e9ba921637ee6b4d8cb27aa	Well, I usually watch tv or movies. Hang out with my friends.   Or, better yet, play online, like your doing right now. It helps.  My boyfriend is at work. && Actually just texted me asking   WHY i haven't been texting him all day.

If she is constantly unavailable and if you guys are not that serious to the point that you are insecure because you are not talking to her...you should probably rethink where your priorities are because obviously her's are elsewhere.
KAyGPgzeaa	Well, this happend to me a couple of years ago and I just went with the flow and flirted a bit and just acted myself. But if he still doesnt ask you, then ask him how he feels but ask him like this, " I dont want to rewin our friendship, but i really need to know how you feel about me, I like you a lot but i dont want it to be awkward if you say you dont like me back" and listen to his response, trust me, it works!!|`|dvD14WUAaa	if he just broke up with his old girlfriend a month ago and says he wants u,he mght just be trying to starighting things out with his life.it might be thats he is telling the truth.but if he stabed u in the back,he might be a bad one to go out with.|`|CnuwupbOaa	It's somewhat b.s. He's definitely postponing for something, but he expressed it in words, which he should have not done.  It obviously gotten you wound up. I believe it's an issue of what's right and wrong. He's thinking hard about all the choices he made and options he has. He's wondering if going out with you would be the right choice in terms of social status and how other might look at him as if he left her to join you. It may seem disreputable. I don't know all the details. It just feels wrong to leave someone and jump on someone else's wagon. A lot of people still do it today because of their selfish emotional concern, but maybe not for him.    He most liking left your ex-best friend because he was getting agitated with her manipulating him and she didn't like him anywhere near you. Let him think on it.     You are not the rebound. That's a stupid word/action to even be used for relationships. The guy has some sense of dignity so you being the rebound is not the case. It's just to feels like a sudden change for him right now.|`|reLsuFZiaa	ok..in any situation..he might be deciding whether to get back with his girlfriend so basically he might be dangling you both on a string.

ct8IM4FNaa	i think you should give it a try. if for 7 years he still wanted and did see you, then i seriously doubt that he did not want a daughter.  the thing that you have to be prepared for is the possibility that your mother has not told you the truth. some parents tell little white lies, or major ones, thinking that they are protecting their child. and some do it for revenge on the other one.  did your mother move and not tell your father where you were? so many things can be a factor in why you are not seeing him right now.   i had a boss who had not seen his daughter since she was 12 or 13. she is 25 now. well he was dying of a brain tumor.  he found where she was and was writing to her. never once did he tell her that he was dying. well, she was still mad at her father, and never answered him.   after fighting this anurism/tumor for 2 years it finally took his life at 53. he never got to see his daughter sarah again.  well, she came to his funeral and was very upset. had she have known what was going on, she would have been  in contact with him. so she has a lot of regrets.  however, now she has a beautiful relationship with his longtime companion, ruth.  so at least make the attempt to find him. ask your mother to please try and help you. if not ask her siblings or parents anything. never give up. i am sure you have a lot of questions for him.   good luck sweetie. and keep your chin up high.|`|QYtQhUtFaa	yes you should everyone kids should know they father good luck|`|KAv7Ze0xaa	thats a toughy simply because I'm sure your dad remembers he has a daughter.'

Just go out and enjoy flirting with the girls for the time being.|`|UG1UFtLJaa	confidence isa good thing, but don't go to overboard try to be a little more modest...they might respond better  Love will find you if your paying attention|`|g68EhRIIaa	OK..first off you say you are attractive..so your probably looking for a  gorgeous girl and  no offense but most these girls are very "empty" or to full of themselves to care..i wouldn't say you need to lower your standards but don't always go straight to the hottest girl you can find some of the best girls are just average.|`|l8GhgJdGaa	Don't lower your standards unless they are unobtainable. Ex: I wish I had a girl with a million Ferrari's. EVER.    Look, being single isn't bad. In fact, we are single freaks, haha. I am single and enjoying every minute of it. I'm gonna start a Single Freaks Club...just for us single freaks!!
lJvUpszNaa	Most times I just ignore it.  It's not worth arguing about because I know better and everyone who knows me would know it's not true also.    If I was insulted in a profressional field, I would talk to the person who did the insulting privately if I felt they were mature.  If they're not mature, I'd talk to the boss if it was a constant problem.    Since you're asking this in singles & dating, I'm assuming a bf/gf insulted you.  This is a big no no.  Tell them they need to stop.  If they don't, leave 'em behind.  They're not worth your time if they don't want to get to know you.|`|AA12041346	i laugh it off sometimes.  depends on who says it  and i like korean music too|`|JGfdkFpqaa	I have always just said "OK". It really throws people off because an insult is meant to get a rise out of you. It makes people mad if you don't react defensively.|`|QYtQhUtFaa	DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF INSULTS|`|AA12376061	walk up to them, step on their toes, so they cant move, and push them over, then laugh at them  while they lay there on the ground with a surprized look on their face, I make sure to laugh real crazy like, so they wont ever bother me again.|`|hMIGw1VZaa	Depends. If its a lame insult(things that have nothing to do with you, if they lnew you like fat, dumb, whore, skank etc.), laugh it off or call them out on the lameness. If its personal or from somebody who actually matters to you, insult back or confront them.     Or, second choice, is automatically call back "Your Mom!", or if they call you like (for example) a whore, go "Your Moms a whore!"   Then people will know you don't care and it doesnt phase you, as long as you can laugh at your own lameness, for using "you mom"  :-)|`|dce2b7e03fad6246563e2d4ed8fad9d4aa	first I try to consider why an insult was made-second I consider who made the insult-  then if I think I did something wrong-I appologize    or may have done something this person didnt like-unless they are known for being mean-I will ask that one what they think I can do to do better and let them explain it    there are times when I will humor a remark    if a person isnt mean but has the issue -I thank them    although sometimes I will thank a mean person and tell them from you that is a compliment-it usually only adds to the problem-as the Bible says if you correct a mean person they will be mean to you, a foolish person they will try and make a fool out of you, a bad person they will try and hurt you=Proverbs    praying for you in Jesus amazing grace that saved me=John 3 repented of my sins-even one lie, and asked Jesus in to forgive me and help me do better, and be my friend. amen. Revelation 3:19&20  "I love you and ask you to repent, Behold I stand at your heart door and knock, if you ask me in I will be your friend."   best wishes, David I would insult you by saying "I think your sweet, princess." Now how will you deal with this one?|`|xm7kFnfNaa	Take it with a grain of salt. My friends don't insult me so those who do don't know me. No problem.|`|xnZ4hVQwaa	Get em in bed ;)|`|5d73b153670425c028538ee2a612fa54aa	trust me they get the royal lip service if they insult me.|`|47ra3sUiaa	This is what i do and it really works      when somone insults you with other people around, dont say anything back at all and just take the diss, this will make the other person look like a complete a******** and the people around you will feel more sympathy for you then for the one who insults you. Then they wont be so quick to through disses if there the ones who are looking bad from it      but if theres no one around and you had it up to here with a certain person go tell them to sit on a tack or screw off. Or you could sarcastically laugh the diss off like nothin , thats a great way to tick somone off|`|fzi2FxG9aa	Well, it all depends on who insulted you and how bad the insult was...like if it was a friend and the insult was either a mistake or just for fun laugh it off or if it was a stranger but the insult wasn't so bad, tell your friends and have a good laugh, however...if the friend insults you on purpose and it really hurts you, then I would reconsider being friends with that person...maybe being friends with that person isn't such a great idea. If it was a stranger and it was horrible insult and the person did not even know you, come up with a clever insult, say it to his/her face in front of everyone and embarrass them, then just walk away triumphant! :)     Smile!! Even if the insult sucked, not everyone feels the same way. Besides what does that horrible stranger or your "friend" know?? Right??|`|AA10100615	I let it go.   Not worth my time.

sxBHKb6Laa	You should probably start by picking up a phone, now that the obvious is out of the way, try to make the conversation interesting by staying away from dull "How was your day" , "What do you want to do when you grow up" stuff and focus on things guys like. And what do guys like? Sex, Sports, Competition, things like that. I'm not suggesting you memorize the player roster or baseball lingo simply saying that you can focus on things that make him enjoy the conversation. If it does get personal, don't immediately fork over all the info he wants to know. I'm not suggesting playing mind games, but a little resistance makes people more interested in the conversation, therefore you. Generally you should keep it short, no longer than thirty minutes. This means less time for awkward pauses that result in things like "So what do you want to talk about?" Trust me. I'm a guy and I know what we like and I know girls and have asked them about how they manage to keep conversations interesting. Hope I've been helpful, just give it a try.  Contact me when you have more questions.|`|0c865a41a594efe3ae40bc2eb041ec1daa	just talk like you would talk to him face to face.|`|4eb9f73346cd0965ef7d1588be585dffaa	Dear Molly,  If you can coax the boy into talking about himself as much as he wants to, and you become this WONDERFUL LISTENER, you'll both get to learn a lot about him while you're making points with him for being attentive, listening and HEARING what he's saying. This also will help you develop the gift of "hearing between the lines."  (Something women pride themselves on through experience). Everyone likes to talk about themselves and be "heard."  When he starts to fidgit and sound awkward, change the subject to something less personal and work the conversation around to a few very meaningful points about yourself -- maybe taking his cue and speaking about those same things. You need not agree with everything he says; it's always better to be truthful about yourself and what your boundaries and limitations are. You can find out what his boundaries (what he'll accept or not) and limitations (pretty much the same). If you both know each other's boundaries an limitations, there's less chance that either of you will overstep each other's.    Good luck. Sooner or later you'll develop a pattern of conversation and listening so that you'll be a most interesting person to be in relationship with. Keep yourself active mentally above all and if you get little or not formal education, at least keep abreast of current events around your hometown and around the world. you'll be able to speak with both princes and kings.|`|5ea76b6e02f899948b8c43de9828fd9faa	you pick up the phone, dial and talk....it's not that hard|`|4a10d854b2a1b4a49dc84a9acbc501c1aa	just be yourself as you would if you were talking directly to him.  i hate talking on the phone but my guy friends have told me that when girls think they say stupid things on the phone, guys actually think its cute|`|6NUYXlw8aa	he should call u|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Well if you guys are, you know, pretty close, then it won't seem as awkward. But just be who you normally would be talking to him in person. If you do that, everything will go smoothly. Trust me, it will be okay. And if you've never done this before, just call his cell phone so that if someone else in his family picks up, you won't sound weird saying, "Is so-and-so there?" And they'll be like who's this? So just try doing what I told you and it will be fine. Good luck!|`|r0DnpdHqaa	huh?|`|ecbCVVBZaa	Well there is no girl code and if there is i missed the memo!

h490QPvMaa	It probably means that one or both of you are not properly nurturing the marriage.  I personally think it is very unhealthy and detrimental to so many (especially kids).

It's a casual way to ask and one that can be answered in the same way without any awkwardness. x|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	no, don't ask, just leave it. It sounds as if he may be the one doing the brushing off! After all, if he wanted to see you again, he could phone, couldn't he?!|`|Mo11f4PLaa	He sounds like he is not interested. If you approach him at work and make him uncomfortable, he could accuse you of sexual harassment. That will lead to you getting fired. Would it really be worth it? Not to me.|`|5b84896bcaf8a58a9b32b4d4697699c7aa	i would wait a bit and when you get the chance in seeing him tell how you would like to spend some time again.  if says it not a good idea then you'll have to move on.  just don't do that again.|`|uryMShzbaa	Sounds like he just wanted some fun.....|`|Psaw4xdIaa	don't worry about the e-mail.  If he is interested, he'll come after you.  Wait for him to make the next move.|`|ttsjvpCUaa	I think you call and just be honest... ask him if he likes you and  if so good,if not you can move on and not waste your time.  I don't think you brushed him off and maybe you could just keep things strictly business at work until you see if it works. Some jobs frown on co-workers dating,etc....  good luck!!!|`|97dddda4eafdbfcd71a7cb265d17c078aa	No brush off..you are very sensilbe and like to get to know people.I suggest that in conversation you suggest "we may again meet up sometime,i really enjoyed our evening out".    ..then leave it to him,if he ws kissing you i doubt very much he will reject you,but you have nothing to loose anyway,only gained experience..and there are plety of nice men out there.

gn9l3i3Naa	I am 37 and love to flirt.   BE CONFIDENT.  If the guy doesn't respond, there are many others -a matter of probability. Look him in the yes, just a bit longer than you normally would.  Touch him on the hand the sleeve the shoulder.  Stand close much of the time showing you have interest in him.  Don't smile all the time but often-sort of have the look that you are happy to be in his company but not desperate to be there.   Have fun flirting is supposed to be fun for both parties.  Talk about things that will make you both laugh.  Don't complain about anything.|`|NTcDXRxTaa	B  a girl|`|fLEaQdzcaa	Anything with a vagina is enough to get me hyper-ventilating.|`|87Sj9pPNaa	dont we all??|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Well...I'm not the best at this either, but just talk to him and laugh at all his stupid jokes, that kind of thing.

2nZSjgHMaa	you were "the rebound girl" which isn't fun.    next time, consider caring about getting together with someone who just had a fresh beak up, hon.  you're not being fair to yourself in getting together with someone who doesn't have anything to give.    when people break up, they need time to grieve, and readjust to life.  this guy apparently wouldn't allow himself time.      truly, when a person who just broke up gets into another serious relationship right away, they are simply trying to prove they are loveable again, either to themselves or their ex  (i'm sure this is mostly subconscious, but it's true).    take care of YOU... find other friends, date around and perhaps when you least expect it, you will meet someone you are compatible with!  take care ok?|`|AA12296157	Are you?  It's not even smart to think of asking other people if you should maintain a relationship with someone who thinks you're stupid.  That kinda legitimizes what he thinks is true.

Just dump him and move on with life.|`|izD5XH7gaa	i didnt realli get much of that. try spacin stuff out a bit more! ;)    from wat i got, i reckon eva hes a skanky playa and u should leave it be and move on,    or he's just confused.

You took a chance and it didn't work out.  It sounds like the guy was vulnerable and in need and you were there for him (by your own choosing).  It sounds like he and his ex worked things out and now he doesn't want to be with you anymore but he doesn't want to hurt you either.  I know it hurts, but I would just let him go and have no contact for a while.  Later, after your heart mends, you can try to be friends again.  By the way, to answer your question...no, you're not stupid.  This happens to EVERYONE at least once, if not more times, in their life!

PLSVajz8aa	take a step back. if he wants to be with you let him put some effort too. maybe backing off will spark his interest again too.     but for now, the more you push, the more he'll back away.|`|69e5ff6d9e277bcad5ded9348b7877fdaa	I know this is harsh and now cliche, but he.... "is just not that into you."      If a guy is into you, even if he is drop dead tired, he will make time to pursue you.      The good news is that it most likely doesn't have anything to do with you at all.  It could be job problems and he doesn't have the time or inclination to necessarily focus on another person like he thought he might.  Or perhaps he just isn't feeling a vibe with you.    Guys hate confrontation with a girl more than anything, because they have no idea what we will do.  (Tears, throw stuff, etc ;)).  So instead they just fade out and hope you quietly get the picture.    If you need closure you are most likely not going to get it.  Instead try to find it by yourself, and lean on your friends for a few days to boost your self esteem.    Then you need to get back into the game and keep playing :)  You will find your guy who is crazy about y ou and doesn't want to chance losing you!    Take care!|`|DWHj3TVJaa	well we are all different and for me if i tell you that i need space then i really need it also if this guy isn't interested in you then he wouldn't have bothered after the first date he wouldn't of called back or anything so just give him awhile and everything should be for or possibly he just got out of a relationship and is avoiding you for a lack of a better term because he doesn't know if hes quite ready to move on yet(you may be advancing too quick)...

Popping pills along with anti depressants  can be extremely effective on causing extreme anxiety both physical and mentally. Your boyfriend is finding "escape" as a way to cope with the stressful situation he finds himself in. He is either out there finding help for himself, or has given up and is letting go of any efforts of to maintain and strive. If you can contact a close friend of his or family member and voice your concerns for him that you have, and ask if they can help in locating him as I feel he is in a very dangerous state of mind. Call a help hot line who deal with people who are suicidal. They may be better to assist you with the good advice you need. I do hope all turns out well. Best of luck to you.|`|JTccRXF2aa	He should be in rehab............|`|js7gJGKQaa	well...if i were you....go find him..try to reach him..tell him that you love him,that you still want a family with him and that he is exactly what you want.that you are not too good for him and that you want to be happy WITH him...i dont know if this helps you..since its only what i would do:fight^^|`|fvhfHhjxaa	Maybe he went to rehab.

There are so many things to consider before dating someone at your work place.    - Is there a company policy against intra-office relationships?  - When things go bad during your relationship the whole office will be the audience.  - If ever the relationship doesn't work out, how awkward would you feel seeing the guy each workday?

Dating co-workers is a bad bad bad idea.    If you can work out the issues with your current man then do your best to do that.  If you love him and you've committed 2 years to the relationship, don't you think the two of you deserve an honest attempt at fixing things?    Good Luck!

wxt2glrYaa	well  since you slept with the guy - i think game over  I mean, once you go there, there is no going back  a lot of couples relationships are sex oriented  it looks like you both wanted it, got it and now confused  You either want to sleep with him again or not sleep with him  That is the question, you can not change the nature of the relationship once you guys exchanged fluids

7a8f097f47892379190c9c1c668a0984aa	I think I could help you better if I knew if you were the child or the adult.  However, the best thing you can do is be patient, kind, and understanding.  Look at the situation from everyone else's point of view and try to support them.   Spend time by yourself, or with your friends when you can, because everyone needs their own time to breathe, vent, and generally process things.   Find ways to keep smiling, and things you have in common with the new people in your home.  There will be difficult times, but usually those lead to figuring out how to work as a family unit.  Learn from those, and keep pushing forward.   Best of Luck!|`|4xFKJsLeaa	I've done it, but it takes time and patience. I read books went to a support group. Now the kids are grown and I'm glad they are doing well. Praying doesn't hurt and I did that a lot.

xkzcTXdtaa	Run as far as you can in the opposite direction. You can tell her how you feel and get all the cards on the table and give her the chance to break up with her boyfriend if she decides she wants to be with you, OR that will show her you are serious and give her the chance to back off. Either way, be noble and do NOT get involved with this woman while she has a devoted BF, think of how you would feel if another man was messing with your woman at her work. Those type of relationships rarely work out and I think this woman is giving you attention that you've been craving and not been getting elsewhere in your life. However, it is a fantasy and not reality. Try filling in your spare time with things you enjoy and try to keep yourself occupied. If you don't have the nerve to confront her than keep it professional, or later on down the line you will regret having started a relationship by cheating, and you will wonder if she will do the same thing to you later on. Please, I know this is hard, just consider and try doing the right thing.|`|b4afa91e5deed372059cf000f4faf28daa	I don't think you're supposed to be doing what you are doing.

CnuwupbOaa	He means it, but I at a young age people could say naive things. You or him are not old enough to consider the conditions that may change in the future. He's just enamored as you are.|`|AA10843567	I honestly do NOT think he loves you, here is why, if he did love you he would not be promising that he will marry you 'if you do not find any other guy' because he would be saying that he IS that guy for you...A guy who likes someone won't say if you find someone else because he wants to be that someone, he wants to be that guy to marry you, so why would he feel so comfortable mentioning another guy taking your place or even have that thought....You're too young! I am being honest. I had my first b.f at age 18 because I wanted to wait until I was legal and old enough....And even when I was dating him I did not want to talk about marriage and was not obsessed over him or the thought of marriage either because I knew that I had a long time to think of that and because I knew that guys his age are not always serious and want to experiement. So be careful and stop taking everything he says sooo seriously because not everything a guy says is true. Slow down and worry about getting an education first and going to college! NOT boys.
8ARh1TY8aa	LOVE means "trusting yourself with someone who has seen you at your worst and loves you in anyway"..       -it means teasing each other, laughing together and only the two of you who can understand that...      -it means feeling safe to talk about anything and having the patience to workout disagreements..      -it means counting on someone who sympathizes when you had a bad day, worries about you when you're gone too long and always welcomes you with open arms...no matter what..|`|McWF8xmcaa	I don't know what your trying to ask?!?!?! but it sounds like she's not the one if your trying to figure it out.

34a7b6e3051820f067046aa7a01deae7aa	Don't hang out with your friend while she's with her boyfriend. Instead try to set up a time when you two could hang out together...alone or with a few other friends. Like maybe you could go shopping or something.

Whenever a person (male or female) asks somebody out, they run the risk of rejection.  However, if you don't try, how will you know?

eSVgmuQpaa	That same thing happened with me and my old best friend.  Im 14 but im a little more advanced than the other kids i know.  I always thought my best "girl" friend was beautiful and i didnt have enough courage to tell her until a few months ago.  As soon as I did, something clicked.  She started to look at me different, not like a friend, but she wanted us to have a relationship.  A week after that we were going out and happier than ever.  All because I called her beautful.  Were still going out and even happier than ever because we both understand eachother perfectly.  If you think you have a shot with her, try it, I didnt think she would like me back but she did.  You never know unless you try|`|Djn9lhA7aa	I read this good article on MSN the other day.  You should check it out, it lets you kinda know if a girl is into you or not.    http://msn.match.com/msn/article.aspx?ar...    My guess is, if you think she likes you, then theres a strong possibility that she does.  Also, you can 't go into a relationship expecting it to last forever, especially since you're so young still, but also because it'll be too much pressure for you and her to be perfect and there's no such thing as the perfect relationship.  So, just take it slow, keep the expectations low and keep doing what you're doing now since it seems to be working.  Good luck bro.
1891cd4553276555a462717c6223d747aa	I BELIEVE kissing is the most intimate part of having sex....if a guy didn't kiss me first of all...we wouldn't be going further....|`|AA11495841	ok heres alot of things that makes a guy not kissing a girl:  1- the girl's hygene.  2- breath smell.  3- something wrong with her mouth.  4- she isnt a good kisser.  5- when a guy isnt kissing a girl it means he isnt here for love, he is here to have sex, so when a guy is not kissing a girl while they are sleeping together, it means that he doesnt love her, and he isnt emotionally connected with her, and he doesnt want it to be like this, so he is just for sex...      so i'd say be carefull, and try to see what goen on...    think it over more than once, nothing what it seems like, so just be careful  =)    good luck any way...

pwEeIza9aa	First you need to learn to dance well. The best way is to find inexpensive group dance lessons with older women. I know you don't want to do that because you are not interested meeting any of them. That is beside the point. You will not be nervous because you are not interested in them and because they will be thrilled to dance with you. A few will be very good dancers and before long you will be very good dancer. Then you can go back to the clubs and have confidence to dance with young girls.    If you still lack confidence, start asking the homely and older gals. They will all accept. Then you can ask the pretty girl you want to dance with. She will be more likely to accept because she has noticed you are dancing with other girls and so, in her opinion, you will not be putting the make on her. If she turns you down just ask the homely girl she is setting with or the one at the next table. Either will accept, That way, you were not rejected by someone you were obviously interested in. She was just one another girl you asked to dance.|`|AA12213723	you know the girls are pro bally feeling same way?you have to build your self confidence, remember, their just people to, just like you with same fears of getting rejected, but if you never give it a try, you'll never know, you may be missing out on the ONE by being scared and embarrassed. get out there dance, have fun and stop worrying over something you don't know about?all they can say is no, whats the deal, you cant handle a little word?come on you can do it,have faith in yourself|`|AA11495841	why do u go to clubs if u dont dance, and u wanna change ur self???    goen to club is a big and awesome experience, u should take an advantage of it man...    do nothing, just be confident, and have a little faith in ur self, go and ask any girl to dance with you, be polite and straight, dont lisp, dont blurt, and dont stammer, so just go straight and ask her to dance with you, and plz dont go all over her when u dance, leave a distance, and dont try to touch her nipples, a$s, or any thing man, just have a little decent gentle cool sweet dance, and thats it, then offer her another dance, after that a drink or something, and then take her number, but dont go too far, and dont think about her panties, or sex at that night...    all in all ull be the king of any club, enjoy man   =)  ;)|`|fsEG9wj0aa	Learn to dance....     Go to totalvid.com or some other vidoe rental place and get some howto dance videos.... I believe they have section on how to talk to girls.|`|6yWgIJ8eaa	I've been there, man now I just don't care which is a problem in itself.  The way I got over it was to punish myself into asking out 100 girls.  Internet dating is an easy way to practice dating women especially if your a glutton for punishment, but hey you might get lucky.    I don't do this anymore, but I used to ask a girl out and then just keep asking girls out, at one point I had like 7 dates lined up.  I don't do it anymore because its exhausting and its not nice, it was good practice, just remember if you do this treat the women respectfully and don't use them once something has been established.     I take the attitude that a date is nothing, if we establish a relationship then I am exclusive.|`|uSjzTPvMaa	Well instead of you just sitting,and standing go up to a girl and see if she wants to dance.If that doesnt work then go get a drink and give it to a girl then ask if she wants to dance
5xm6pS2Saa	You're very nice to try and help her, but there isn't much you can do. I mean, you could just flat out tell her that she acts childish and that she should mellow down, but she could take offense to that. But hey, she's not a good friend of yours anyway, so I guess you could just do that. Then she'd make more friends and she wouldn't be hated as much. You have a kind soul! Good luck!

mnGibTZsaa	Aw.  I know how you feel. I'm in the exact positition cept i'm the girl and he's the guy.   Anyways....if she just wanted to make out then she may be a player cause all she wants are her own sexual desires and not you in general and what counts which is in the heart.  Ask her properly and find out that way don't make assumptions.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Hmm. maybe she still does like you and she wanted to see your reaction when she kissed you, and when she saw that you were stunned she thought she screwed up and saying she didnt like you was somehow covering up for it. Either that or she is just really weird. Most girls dont go making out with their ex boyfriend just because they felt like it without wanting to get more serious. Either way, I think you should still tell her that you still have feelings for her and see how things turn out.
MLv83VuZaa	not telling her will be the way to go if you don't want anything to happen.    when you acknowledge the fact that you maybe liking this girl, it also made you open and vulnerable to the fact that she might not feel the same way.    not acting on it and not letting her know will not change anything, but can you live with the fact that there will be a lingering question in your mind "what if i told her?" and sadly you will never know.    meanwhile if you tell her, there can only be two things, you get a chance or you get rejected, but at least you wouldn't have to live asking yourself "what would've happened if...?|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Well, you can't just leave it, can you? You cant get her out of your head so maybe you should talk to her or something. The worst that can happen is she doesn't like you back. Unless she is your really close friend (things would get awkward) nothing worse then what is happening now would happen. No girl would stop liking a guy in a friend kind of way because they like them.|`|AA10460213	1) the dreaming thing is pretty natural... more about that later  2) being passive and not doing something when you think you should is a big factor that often leads to depression, and a lot of what you feel comes from this  3) it's better try and fail than to not try - "learning" is what you get from it if you fail, reaching a goal is what you get if you succeed - and learning helps you reach your goal next time  4) you don't get to decide whether she likes you or not.  you don't like every girl, so duh!... every girl won't like you.  5) just be yourself... there's somebody for everybody  6) if you want to "tweak" yourself a little bit to make yourself a truly better person, then do it FOR YOURSELF, as a long term project... and some future girl may or may not appreciate it  7) it's best to NOT jump right out there with "how you feel"... so don't do that (it's great to say it if you truly mean it WHEN the relationship reaches a higher level... but girls don't like "shallow" feelings, and infatuation is shallow, no matter how strong)  8) the best way to handle this situation is... flirt  9) if she flirts back... game on  10) if she doesn't flirt back... then it's not meant to be (and telling her how you feel still won't work)  11) the longer you stay in this limbo-land, the less chance you'll have if you ever do make a move... girls get a vibe from lurking infatuation by a guy that makes them feel creepy  12) so just flirt... and no guarantees... things may work, or they may not  13) when you get comfortable with taking action when it "feels" like you should... and get comfortable with the idea that sometimes you'll be successful, and sometimes you won't... your angst will decrease... and you'll naturally figure out that tying yourself in knots with dreaming is counter-productive  14) so the bottom line... do something!  and be okay with not succeeding, as long as you learn something POSITIVE no matter what the outcome.  you may get what you want the first time, or later down the road, but it's impossible to fail forever with this approach... and there's a (good) chance that you'll get something better on the second or tenth try than you would have gotten if you succeeded on the first try    GOOD LUCK!|`|9c3e30036ff1806139e4e11e72cfc8b4aa	this is what i call love...|`|TC4PWF5taa	Same thing happened to me Gibbo. Stay close to her, and look for signs. If you think she still likes you. Ask, the worst thing she can do is say no. If she says no, just remain friends.     Good luck|`|zVCiTozLaa	you should tell her how you feel, only then you will know....  then u have to decide what to do, to keep being depressed or to move on with your life..  this happend to me also .. make your move
kxwyqJnsaa	I think she probably did like you.  But things change...people change.  She might have found someone else.  Or she just might really cherish your friendship.  Just be there for her as a friend and who knows maybe she might realize she has feelings for her.  But if not, you should move on.  Good Luck!|`|v85fW4T2aa	Firstly, I'd like to say "I'm sorry she put you through that." Some girls can be really heartless, especially if they're not into the guy in question.     As for her leading you on...there're two ways to interpret what you've told us. A lot of girls hug and kiss their friends when they meet them so when she hugged you, it mightn't have been a sign of affection. If it was, then she was leading you on.    I totally sympathetize with you, though. Something very similar happened to me. I was friends with this guy I had a crush on and he moved to UK to study. Less than a year later, he returned to Singapore to join the Army for the compulsory service all males have to go through.     Before he left for UK, we used to communicate a lot via email and smses. We were kinda close. He helped me by giving me tips for my exams (he was a year senior to me but in another school) and the night before he left, I called him to say bye and we had a nice long chat.    When he was in UK, we used to email each other about twice a week...which later ended up being twice a month (both of us were busy). We seemed to be becoming really close.     When he came back to Singapore, I invited him to join me for choir one evening and when I met him, I hugged him (which kinda stunned him). Well, after that evening, he stopped returning all my messages and if he did reply, he'd only reply to half of what I asked him. Then, when he joined the army, he seemed to have gotten over that lil embarrassing "hug" incident and he replied when he could.     Now, for the past year I've tried to get in touch with him for many different reasons and in many different ways but he doesn't respond. He's just avoided me completely.     Understandably, I was upset but I got over it. I talked to a friend who helped put things into perspective and now, all's good. I really couldn't care less about that guy.     It'll take time, though, to get over this girl. It won't happen overnight, I can guarantee you, but it will eventually happen. Obviously she isn't interested in you the way you are in her, so just move on. Don't let her see that it's affected you in the least.    All the best!!! And if you need a shoulder to cry on or just someone to talk to, email me. Good luck and be strong!|`|FR7CPUY0aa	maybe she really does like you but something is lingering in her mind that is a little uneasy. be friends with ehr for a while and get closer to her and if she starts acting like a total stranger, i know you lover her but, thats not how you treat a friend or anyone.|`|194bdb9195d069d50f6138efe4e84e05aa	probably she likes you, but smth holds her from being with you, and that must be worrying her. or she just wanted to check how much you're into her, tease you, just to have a man by her side, and had no more intentions than just being friends. talk this out with her. though i doubt she'd ever tell you|`|QfhqkHacaa	Wow, ouch, I felt this one too. Some people talk more at a distance. I don't know what is going on with her but close up and personal does say it all. I like the nice guys. I wish they would like me instead of those meanies so much. Maybe if I dress loose and talk like a snot bag? If that is how she is going to treat you, I wouldn't sign up for more. You sound like a very nice person. There are nice girls out there that wish you would talk to them. I would look elsewhere. Yeah, maybe she will grow up. It's still cold, brrrr. It gave me the shivers to read that.     Yeah, my advice is look somewhere else. No answer is an answer. If she wants to be like that, be alone.|`|il3Uu2NCaa	tDear , let,s make it clear that each & every thing can,t be understandble  or managble.

m3hS7sp2aa	Well since you said you talk to her here and there, then try asking for her number one time casually. Or be like "Hey I have to go, but I still want to talk to you. You want to talk on the phone??" Something like that. Gooduck =)|`|AA11151794	The very best way to get her number is to see her in person, give her your number and ask her for her number.  If you do not know where to find her but you think she may remember you from school, write her an e-mail to remind her of some of the experiences you may have had in common at school and that will make her feel more open to give you her telephone number when you request it.  Tell her that you would like it because you are interested in taking her out for some social dating.  That should help also.  Best wishes.|`|OFIy2Fwbaa	Erm.  Ask her to call YOU via myspace?  Ask if you can call her via myspace?  (might be more interesting if you ask her to call you...)  Surely you can't be too shy in front of a keyboard and monitor?!  Take advantage of that.    If there's not so much a way to work in the phone conversation angle: Ask her to hang out!    It'll be fun.  What's the worst that could happen?  She can't eat you!  (I didn't mean like that, you pervert) Smile, be confident - whatever you worry about, whatever worst case scenario you could imagine happening - actually isn't that bad.  Think about it.  What's the worst case scenario, REALLY?    "Get and stay out of your comfort zone. I believe that not much happens of any significance when were in our comfort zone."    Be quick to decide. Remember what General George S. Patton said: A good plan violently executed today is far and away better than a perfect plan tomorrow.    Were not here for a long time; were here for a good time.    Have fun!|`|0xA0oocsaa	Yeah its better to get the number yourself. That's a good step. So next time when your on myspace talking to her get all your thoughts together and remember she can't see you so its okay. Then just say something like " We talk a lot on myspace but maybe you should call me sometime..." Then you can give her yours. That's usually easier. But if you want to get hers you can say something like." We talk a lot on myspace and I was wondering if maybe I can call you come time?" And there you go. Don't worry typing is so much easier then asking it in person. Well good luck! If you want that number you'll get the courage! =)|`|o2XqUG5Yaa	man up... go up to her and ask her.. it's that simple... what's the worst that could happen? she says "no"? big deal.. if she gives it to you, then you know for sure she will be expecting your call... if you get her number from someone else, you'll never know if she really wanted to hear from you or not...|`|0EJwnyBVaa	Just ask, its always better if a man can just say whats on his mind.......|`|887d2b52ea11a68dc7db842bba4924eaaa	jus be like i was wonderin if i could have your number so we could talk a little more instead of over the computer jus be calm and collected about it|`|AA10260318	HOW ABOUT U ASK HER 4 THE PHONE NUMBER SO THAT U CAN CALL HER|`|Wnu3ZVmoaa	You have to be bold and confident. Just go for it, if you really like her just go on myspace and send her a simple message 'hey, I was wondering if I could have your number, I'd love to go out sometime' Any girl would  love it if a guy just came out and said that. She will definatly reply. good luck :)|`|bWKbfcbPaa	just ask! girls really dont mind giving out their numbers! unless your hideous...hahajk
24XGvxUjaa	I had a similar situation happen to me. I was really into this guy and he was interested in me as well. Then one day out of the blue, the calls stopped.  I thought so much of him, but when he did that, it really changed my opinion. I realized that I deserve a guy that will not string me along as a "maybe" girl...I figured, if he is not interested anymore, so be it...I think in your situation, any long distance relationship is tough and maybe this guy realizes that....Could that be why he stopped writing back? Maybe something has come up and he is busy right now....Time will tell...|`|mS6DhI4uaa	Forget about him you will only seam foolish trying to get him back.|`|db48d9211fe86af67491eef292ac2b3eaa	I have a different problem, but know it really hurts when someone ignores you.  I feel that I have been betrayed though because my friend was maiking out with my ex when we were taking a break for a few weeks.  Now I have to end it tomarrow and I have never truely broke with someone I truely care about.  I don't know what to do.  I know that it hurts and know that someway if I can forget him then you can forget that guy.  I hope you feel better, because right now I feel as if my heart has been ripped out.

Ketika anda berperasaan bahwa anda lakukan sesuatu bagi seserog yg anda rasa baik, tetapi menurut org itu anda bisa saja dianggab munafik dan sedang melakukan trik2 tertentu baginya.    Kalau mengikuti perintah agama misalnya, anda perlu menghafal yg baik dan yg tdk baiknya utk kemudian anda lakukan hal baik dan menolak hal yg tdk baik.    Ada hal yg saya pikir mungkin bisa membantu anda, yaitu anda mulai dari apa hasil akirnya bila anda ingin melakukan sesuatu, jadi misalnya ketika anda mau mengambil barang tercecer dipasar misalnya, maka sebelum anda mengabilnya anda coba menimbang, siapa ya kira2 yg kehilangan barang tersebut?  Apakah barang tersebut sangat dibutuhkannya?  Bagaimana ya ia memperoleh barang tersebut, apakah dg susah payah ia menabung utk membelinya, dan kini tanpa sengaja dijatuhkannya dan terlihat oleh anda?  Lalu anda kemudian perlu bertanya pula,   Bagaimana agar barang tersebut bisa dikembalikan kepada yg empunya?  apakah tdk jadi anda ambil, ataukah anda ambil carikan keamanan atau kantor tertentu utk disampikan agar bisa dikembalikan ke yg empunya, atau mungkinkah anda membuat pengumuman ttg barang tersebut dlsbnya, agar barang tersebut kembali ketangan yg membutuhkannya???  mampukah anda melakukannya??  Prinsipnya kalau apa yg tdk anda sukai dibuat oleh org lain terhadap anda, maka utk melakukan keorg lain ya jangan lah.    Kalau urusan ini mencakup urusan cinta agar anda disukai sebagai manusia baik, maka tentu jawabannya lain lagi ya???  Utk tahap pdkt, ya jangan ladi org lain, jadilah diri sendiri, be a friend dulu lah, kalau ternyata ada kecocokan, baru dilanjutkan menjadi frien yg lebih khusus, buka semua peluang selagi masih  muda, dlm artian peluang yg sehat, baik, beradab ya, bukan asal jadi aja ya!.  Pupuk keterbukaan, open for discussion, bukan asal berdebat tetapi mencari solusi (win-win), keterus terangan, kejujuran, semuanya akan menumbuhkan persahabatan yg lebih natural, tanpa triki, tipu muslisat, kebohongan, dan akal2an, ingat peribahasa sekali lancung keujian, bukanya si lancung ikut2an ujian, tetapi maksudnya supaya menghargai kepercayaan org dg memelihara kepercayaan itu selalu harus dilakukan.  Mudah2an sedikit tulisan ini bisa anda mengerti dan membawa manfaat bagi anda.  Wassallam,
15YkiBFaaa	It doesn't really matter where you sit. It's not like you have to sit in one spot. They'll understand if you talk about how you want to sit somewhere else. As for your friend, just talk to her. I've been in huge fights with my friend and most of the problem comes from not talking straight out to each other. Talk to her and try to reconcile things. The more you're open and engaging to others, then the easier you can make the decisions. Let people know what you want.|`|29fa5c2b95981d1f7ed3fb4d675073b2aa	why not try inviting ur new friend to ur table and at the same time try to patch things up with ur ex friend.

AA12151200	Oh boy...  ..She's hot4U but wants you to take lead, man...  Don't ask her out like you're making an appointment... in fact don't ask her out. -period-.   Make it sound casually, make it part of the talking...  e.g...Comment about a fun movie and tell her someone recommend it to you. -that you're thinking about going, and thought that you could go together...    **she will try to make you say the words, or she will ask you: Are you asking me out?-or- Is this a date, or what?    ->Don't panic..... Just smile or laugh briefly, --stop laughing and look into her eyes, while you tell her:  >>Of course that's a date...and thought it can be fun too...What do you say?..is that a ...?    She will respond yes/no right away...unless she has that evening already taken...  But it is very unlikely that she will "think about it"...  You need to show interest in her,and this way she gets the hint that you've been thinking about her, and making plans..buddy..    We all like to hear that we have been included in someones plans.. It leaves her with a nice feeling...  Be yourself, lead but not in a bossy/pushy kind of way...  Stay in control, relax, and enjoy     G'd Luck!
ri8KJvcVaa	Wow that is very touchy.  You are so young but you seem like you've been threw so much.  I think you can do a couple of things.    You said you considered living with your father but you also said your father was abusive to you mother.  Ask your self this why go from one man who abuses women to another man who abuses women as well even though he is your father.  (2) Also have you thought about this.  If you live with your father that means you're leaving your mother to be and spend more time with her past abusive boyfriend.  Leaving a possible chance of your mother being abused again.  What if he hits her and your not there there to save her.    YOU NEED TO:    Talk to your mom about it on a serious note!!  Tell your school nurse, school guidance counselor,  a teacher you feel comfortable with, or just an adult that you trust to help you and your mother before it gets out of hand.      GOOD LUCK!!    TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH AN ADULT THAT CAN HELP YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.      MAYBE COUNSELING, LIVING WITH ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER.|`|se17ANkyaa	Trust your instincts on this one and if your mother is not open to discussion, find someone who will be.  Perhaps a family member or close friend of the family.  If this is not so, find a counsellor through a health clinic or the school you attend.  It is important that you find someone to talk things over with and the sooner you do, the sooner you will find your peace with the situation.  Good luck.|`|800ae356b1255c019be4ac7d08e8b34aaa	Apparently you are looking for a male role model and neither your moms boyfriend nor your dad can provide that for you. If I was you I wouldn't trust your mom's boyfriend and the reason is because he is not your real father... you said it yourself he's all into your mom and your mom only...  and your dad he sounds like either he really is a bad person but you should really talk to him and find out how he feels about you... You're in a tough position I'm also going to advice you to talk to your mom tell her how you feel and how uncomfortable you are with the situation.. either way the only people you can really trust is your parents|`|AA11125526	You might need to consider other options at this time.   I know that sounds difficult but you've got 4 more years wherever you go.  Going with dad does sound like a bad idea.  However, mom's unhealthy relationship with this guy seems messed up for you as well.  I suggest talking to other family members who you might live with and coming up with an alternate plan of living with one of them.  Then, explain to your mom that it's either you or the  boyfriend.  If she chooses the boyfriend, then it's your mom's loss.  Follow your plan and live with people who are drama free.  It'll make the next 4 years so much easier.
dEPzU0HXaa	Some girls do some dont, Thats life..|`|a22f88d11dd6bd81ac921871179c191daa	Speaking from a girls point of veiw who has just been in this situation, i hope i can help. fpr me personally it scares me! I think this is because i haven't got alot of confidence so can't understand why/how someone could like me so much. Also i think because you don't want to commit yourself just incase you find someone better.  A girl likes to be chased. So the more a guy chases, the more a girl wants to be chased! It's to get the feeling that you are wanted.  Hope this helps, just an opinion!|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	Well i guess it depends on the girl, personally i think is lovely being the way you are, if those girls don't appreciate the way you are it's because they aren't the correct ones, and i don't think you act desperately at all, showing yourself and being the way you are is one of the most amazing qualities ever. in my case i sooooo do prefer a guy who really shoes interest in you in the love kind call me old fashion girl but i think it's wonderful to know someone cares about you and is being himself by telling you how he feels, don't change the way you are, i bet there are sooooooooooooo many girls who would love to find a boy just like you, i must say i am a latin girl and well at least i can say if you are like that with a latin girl she will  be  totally crazy about you, good luck the right girl will soon appear on your life, take care!!!!!|`|9afcce9c6932e5814db58e7db372397aaa	Maybe you have to be a bit more subtle mate....

ekD9RFemaa	have a friend tell her that u think shes cute or u can tell her yourself...if that doesnt interest her than shes oviously not attracted to you so go find someone else|`|tP8Vzywtaa	you cant..she does or she doesnt|`|a946a5dda06b869c9dd2ec65b922d435aa	Don't chase girls.  Make them chase you.  Talk to the girl in the friendliest and most non-threatening way you can - and make it clear that you're not hitting on her.  Then make it clear that you have high self confidence and that you value your time.  Then leave on a high note, like you have somewhere important to be and something fun to do.  Rinse and repeat.  If she doesn't chase you, she's not interested, and will never be.  If so, find a different girl.  If she's interested, she'll give you her number when you ask for it.|`|MHQVnqaXaa	haha thats an impossible question cuz i dont know the girl. its different for every girl. with me: be trustworthy, dont say anything immature or stupid, be somewhat mysterious (yes cliche turn on but its true), and be a gentleman...to an extent  hehe.|`|PQMfIEYjaa	tell her you have a huge package

pXfE195kaa	You've probably found it difficult to start conversations or keep them going with the opposite sex. Follow these steps to conversational glory!  HERE'S HOW:  -Find out what s/he is good at or enjoys doing.  -Find out what the two of you have in common.  -Now here's where it gets tough! It's time to talk! When you have an opportunity to say something, make your move!  -Look him/her in the eye.  -Smile.  -Say, 'Hi.'  -Ask him/her questions about things that s/he enjoys doing.  -Ask him/her questions about the things you have in common. -Mention that you have them in common!  -When you're asking these questions, listen to what s/he has to say!  -When it feels like the conversation is wrapping up, say, 'It was nice talking to you.'|`|9f4b683cc74324085bb23a38464f5f06aa	okay. just say hi, i dont know if you know me, but my name is...._______. just say it. you have nothing to lose. worst case senario...he'll ignore you or look at you funny. BUT SO WHAT? something good also might happen and you guys might find yourself talking to eachother like long lost friends.
qZY9I7g8aa	Just ignore her and see what happens, but honestly if a woman or man plays these types of games, they will do so after you are involved, and I don't like game players.|`|Uo8MLq4xaa	ok|`|XW8KUBKDaa	She sounds strange. Do you really want to be involved with this kind of person? You don't even know her and she's screwing with your mind. Imagine what any sort of relationship would be like. Just ignore her.
w1oJKn41aa	You should look into her eyes, tell her she is beautiful, kiss her, and eventually work your way down. Then look into her eyes and ask her.|`|KaXBF9Ibaa	She just wants you to take control and act like a man sometimes. Don't ask her just start doing things to her out of nowhere that will turn her on.|`|kUxYV4exaa	If you are both into each other then if the moment is right I don't think it is a need to ask kind of thing. I think it is supposed to just happen.|`|XW8KUBKDaa	Don't "ask". I hate it when guys ask to kiss me or make any move. Just do it. Don't disrespect her in anyway. I think you have a good idea of setting the mood and then just leading it to that direction. But going to her and asking,  "Do you feel like getting lucky?" is not a mood setter.

lcKjQo2maa	you deserve the same punishment as all the rest of the household members would get, as you are staying in the house and you knew the rules. You are not special and you know it. Bend over and take what you asked for my man. Good luck. MJ|`|b8b956b2b276b131498b783b5850e58aaa	You should have thought about that before.|`|wqj4q0IPaa	naw, i smoke all the time but maybe you shouldnt do it in the ouse next time..|`|UnaDTYwoaa	Even though smoking pot in the house wasn't that smart, you don't deserve to be whipped.|`|zFcVlg9Raa	if you are staying at your cousins house and you do something that stupid and if that is the punishment what is so special about you that you shouldn't get the same? you did the crime and now you have to face the punishment.
ASz8ETuiaa	From my experience, it's lust  I was 16 with an 18 year old and things just turned out bad  Guys that old that go for younger girls only want one thing whether they say they don't or not  Your young and you'll find a much better guy  I did :)|`|Hy5wF3nHaa	One, he is too old for you.  Two, sounds like too much drama.  You need someone younger.|`|AA10807728	man screw your cousin, do what you want sweetie.  The way you're explaining it, it sounds like shes just jealous and doesnt want to see you happy!!  Tell this guy about your fantasies with him and Fu** him already!!!  have a great time and a great experience:)|`|0dKeEwReaa	I think you are just lusting, and girl 15 is WAY too young to even be THINKING about **** ing a guy!!! Especially one that you just met. So keep your feelings in check, think with your head and not your emotions. I'm really not trying to be rude I am just giving it to you straight up. Dont get all caught up in what you feel, you WILL, not May, you WILL regrete it.|`|bd0a98d7e9ffad7017e44490c80d7784aa	Definitely lusting after him, think carefully before you make any decisions about him he is alot older than you|`|unh2iCtzaa	sorta sounds like lust w/ the eighteen yr old. careful dont get hurt|`|bgFNNDESaa	it sounds like lust.  when your 15, it is fun to date someone older. just be careful not to get pregnant or anything!|`|949846dd3d21a3fad6640e025e04c9dfaa	Relax. Two months from now, your feelings for him will change. Take time to breathe.
134d683c66d54a8fcee38df364748e4daa	he probably really likes you, and since you said you like him, maybe you should just go out.|`|5t0DG9zlaa	why? because guys have to be so  difficult!! i know how you feel!! My guy friend is doing the same thing at the moment.. he has so many ex's and they are all my best friends  well some are and others i hate. people keep thinking we are going out because of the way he hugs me, talks to me, picks on me, and all the weird things that guys do.. But ya know!! lol I know how u feel. Maybe u should just ask him out!! then you would not have to worry.! Just be your self around him!! act normal and then just ask!! :) WELL GOod luck!!!|`|7MDApV6Yaa	maybe he wants attention  maybe he likes you  maybe he's just not bothered.|`|AA10195889	cuz he luvs u, its obvius
7726163948797386528fe21e836f0341aa	Eww, he has a girlfriend and was doing all that? He's gross and a player. Don't have anything to do with him if you want my advice. Just forget about him and find a guy who will be true to you and treat you right.|`|KhrZNuVqaa	yea i think he does    but maybe he doesnt maybe his other gf is boring but he still likes her and ur more fun or somthing    or maybe he likes u both    y dont u ask him      good luck|`|UQURkUI9aa	If he has a GF now and is flirting this way with you now, then you should not go with him. Find a man that can be loyal to you.     Think of it this way- if he is flirting with you like this when he already has GF, how will you like it when he flirts with other women when he is with you?|`|5QtITY1qaa	hmm i think::::  sumthing made him want to break up with you but then he regreted it .& he felt that u werent interested no more [ cuz his ex said u was gonna break up wit him ] & since he feels that way he went out with another girl just to make u jealous

c233860527aa554acebd591cf8154a87aa	Well, if it alright with your parents in your home/ or his parents  at their home.....Invite some friends over, however tell them they have to bring their own soda/snacks, etc.  Maybe you all can play computer games, or Deal or No deal, that is free on the Internet also.  Cold out there, well that kind of cuts out any outdoor activities.Here is another idea, ask your friends to bring whatever games they have.   Hope I helped a bit........|`|MUeOl5Egaa	sit at home and wacth movies on tv|`|R1pFnHwraa	You could stay in one home and play silly games you wouldn't want anyone to know (like digging up your barbie dolls or so).    Or how about borrowing a digital camera from someone, try all kinds of fancy hairstyles and fashions and make fotos.    I'm sure you find something creative you can do at home together. Have a nice weekend.|`|SM2QMS3saa	well why don't you and your mate take along  nice  walk along the beace  or  the up at  the  stars  hey  does'nt your  mate have any money   you should'nt be paying  he should  be paying for the dates
58fcd17183c27d610137dd878317540daa	he broke up w/ you and is now regretting it, depends on how he idi it the rude way or the nice way.u see if he's worht it and if u have ur eye on someone else than clear it up with ur ex that it's not going to work again.
To8MiUAGaa	try this and only this should be bolded.|`|Xjjur378aa	er like:  Hey I'm Bold!Check it out!!  slash ends a tag  It works for itallics-   Underline   and pretty much every html tag including         Have Fun,myspace pwns
b011e3ba0b33518170a53250ce315e89aa	Well, you should just tell him because it seems to me that he really cares for you. but if you want to keep that friendship, and if you believe that if by going out ruins that, then just stay good friends. but you should tell him. i see a connection. [:|`|LWw76V1paa	wow, i can say as far as the kissing interuptions that if you like him then youll get your time, however if you eally dont feel that way about him through time things will lear out and youll just continue to be friends, if you ever really dont like him like that, tell him so that he doesnt get hurt by building up his feelings for so long. you must be a great friend for him to like you that much, so i would be flattered. im in 8th grade too and im in this situation too, LOL he's even short just like your dude (except he asked me to dance and i fealt like i didnt have a choise but i couldnt get his hopes up either, so i danced). well good luck!! ttyl,        ~kassandra|`|5xm6pS2Saa	I think you guys have a connection. You like him, he likes you. Try asking him to a movie or something. I bet he'd say yes! Good luck!!

That would really suck to lose so bad, if that makes sense.|`|g68EhRIIaa	Love in loss because even if does hurt for awhile thats something you have to feel. everyone needs to be loved.|`|8Iex8VP4aa	Never been loved trust me. It kills so bad when you have been loved once and in love once and the person you loved didn't love you back! Really, i would rather have never been loved.

Ce qui compte aussi, c'est la confiance, oser se dire les choses. Si tu arrives  communiquer avec cette personne, tu peux surement l'aider.

Mais il est vrai que la vrit ne fait pas toujours plaisir  entendre    Il faut que des deux c?ts, chacun prenne conscience de ses dfauts, ou mieux, de ce que l'un n'apprcie pas chez l'autre et rciproquement, car les dfauts sont relatifs, surtout entre les deux sexes. Chacun a son comportement, le tout est de se supporter et de le dire quand certains comportement sont considrs insupportables.    Sachant tout cela, il faut se parler en faisant l'effort d'couter et d'accepter la parole de l'autre, meme si ca ne fait pas plaisir. Et trouver une solution plutot que de chercher  avoir raison. entre d'autres termes, passer au stade 2 ! ;)    a+ et bon courage  facile  dire, plus difficile  appliquer, c'est un effor tde chaque jour, car personne n'est parfait. Et l'essentiel n'est pas dans ces petites critiques sur des dtails, c'est l'amour que l'on porte  l'autre. Il faut savoir pardonner et accepter l'autre tel qu'il est, pas lui demander sans cesse de changer pour soi.  Si tu l'acceptais telle qu'elle est, peut-tre te mentirait-elle moins ?... Car on ment souvent  ceux qui ne veulent pas entendre certaines vrits... sauf dans le cas des purs mythos, mais la ca se soigne...

z8YszH3zaa	Il semble avoir rflchi depuis ces paroles de fin, mais qu'est-il prt  faire, pour que tu reste? Est-il prt  changer, est-il prt  arrter de voir son ex, ce qui ne fait que la faire souffrir, puisqu'elle est toujours amoureuse? Est-il prt  prendre en compte tes sentiments, parce qu'on a beau avoir la meilleure volont du monde, accepter sans sourciller, sans que le coeur se retourne et se dchire du haut jusques en bas  l'ide qu'il voit une femme qu'il a aime, et qui elle l'aime toujours, c'est pas vivable?  Accessoirement, es-tu heureuse, toi, dans ces conditions? Et s'il a demand que tu restes, est-ce par amour, parce qu'il a rflchi srieusement, ou est-ce par peur de l'inconnu, de la fin? T'a-t-il donn ses raisons pour que tu restes, et auparavant ses raisons pour que tu partes?    Je crois qu'il va falloir que vous parliez srieusement,  c?urs ouverts. Bon courage, et ne cde pas  une habitude, ou  une envie de rester qui ne serait pas justifie par une volont profonde, et sincre, de chacun de faire le bonheur de l'autre. L'amour, la vie ensemble, c'est aussi faire des concessions, et celle de ne plus voir son ex (situation malsaine s'il en est) m'appara?t comme essentielle.

Estoy plenamente conciente de la estupidez que dije y la forma en como lo dije, no se como corregir mi error aunque asi como va el camino al parecer no me daras la oportunidad de corregir mi error, no te digo que lo corregire haciendo lo que haces por que para eso no soy bueno y la verdad no me gusta, te lo dije de la peor forma. Pero respeto lo que haces por que lo haces de corazon, asi como de corazon te piedo esta disculpa.... blablabla bueno te podria seguir poneindo pero sera mejor que pienses en algo mejor y lo mas importante que lo digas de todo corazon, si no resulta resignate y piensa lo que dices....    por cierto no importa cuanto la ayudes, si la ayudas no tiene que decir que la ames, hasta un amigo lo hace, suerte|`|f7c54ba6c472abf37bb23b7831ad2ed8aa	Resignate, ella tiene razn, a m tampoco me hubieran dado ganas de casarme ( o nada parecido) si mi futuro esposo se hubiera burlado as de la compasin que yo sintiera por otros.

Si no lo tiene, no contestes mensajes de un desconocido. Puede ser cualquiera.  Sin embargo y si quieres salir de dudas, dale una cita para un lugar que conozcas bien. Pero no concurras sola. Que cierta distancia haya algn familiar o amigo tuyo, por si acaso. Si no concurre es porque no quiere exponerse, y las personas que actan desde el anonimato no merecen que se les considere.

Well when he stops mid-conversation or responds late is because he doesn't want to make it seem to you that hes on 24/7 stuck on his computer ready to respond. And well you already DO think he's on 24/7. He doesn't want to sound like an easy guy or desperate. He wants to set a good impression. See like I recently have been doing that with this guy.

Not always so quick to jump immediately to asking them out.    You just have to try something you haven't tried before. If you aren't an assertive person, by nature, see this as a challenge.    You may approach one woman and not have a warm reception. But if you do this often, even just initiating innocent "killin' time in the elevator" conversation, you will find it gets easier and you will be more comfortable. The more comfortable you are, you come across as confident and fun to talk to.    Give it a try ~|`|To8MiUAGaa	Not me.

Uno no se enamora por esas cosas, pero lo que s tienes que revisar es si T te vas a sentir mal por problemas de tu propia inseguridad, no porque ella tenga carrera o no.

Saludos y suerte con tu programa.|`|DP8r2jhbaa	Pues mira, te voy a contar mi historia, cuando era adolescente yo vivia en un pueblito y me encantaba un chico, me hecerque a el hasta tener una relacion de amigos, me enamore, como era muy chica talves no entendia ese concepto, despues me fui a vivir a la cuidad, sin embargo yo me las ingenuaba para escaparme a ese pueblo y verlo le hice saber que me gustaba y el tambien me lo demostraba ya que cuando me escapaba, nos vesabamos, decia que me queria, que crei que me amaba, cuando secuedio eso a mi me dio miedo y como yo queria estudiar una carrera, me temor era que no lo lograra y decidi decirle que ya jamas lo veria, el me pidio que no dejara y yo puse mis sentimientos por detras y lo deje, despues de medio a?o me arrepenti y lo busque, me entere que se habia fugado con una chica y decidi ya no buscarlo nunca mas, cuando tenia 19 a?os lo volvi a ver y me pidio que nos fugaramos, pero yo no quise, ya que me hice a la idea, de que lo que habia pasado entre nosotros solo era un pasatiempo que eramos muy chicos y talves yo no signifique nada para el, ademas que yo no tenia derecho por que el ya tenia un hijo. Yo me case, tuve un hijo, entonces, me entro la curiosidad por saber mi hipotesis era verdadera o falsa, es decir, saber que habia significado yo para el, el tiene un sonido que renta para fiestas, lo contacte como si fuera una cliente, cuando llego al lugar de la cita para afinar detalles, o sorpresa, era yo, la sorpresa que se llevo, era yo. Lo mire de frente y le pregunte "que signique yo para ti", esperaba lo peor y estaba preparada, cuando me dijo que yo era el amor de su vida, que el so?aba que nos quedaramos juntos, que me quiso mucho, que a?os despues y aun el ya casado esperaba que yo regresara, que sufrio mucho, que tenia planes conmigo y que nunca se atrevio a decirme nada por que no le di oportunidad, que se caso por circunstancias, yo lo busque porque no vivia con mi pareja y por que no estaba dispuesta a volver a cometer el mismo error, a quedarme con las ganas de hacer o decir algo solo por creer en hacer lo correcto y no hacer lo que realmente quiero.   Hay cosas se hacen por que se deben hacer por que es lo correcto, cosas que se tienen que hacer por que no te queda de otra, y cosas que se quieren hacer por que tu corazon lo quiere, entonces...  La experiencia que me dejo es hacer las cosas que quiero, en ese momento, por que talves  despues sea demasiado tarde, ahora tengo 27 a?os y el tiempo es algo que nunca regresa.|`|ZRIpZj4daa	ojala tuvieramos la oportunidad de sentarnos y ver nuestra vida atravez de un proyector de como seria si actuaramos de una forma y como si actuaramos de otra y ya nosotros escogeriamos la correcta.

BfQmjmapaa	Alexa-   wake up!! I think he definately likes you!! i mean no guy who does all of that is doing it to be friends so be happy girl! next issue the getting close with no kiss thingymabob..i suggest that if it happens again which im sure it will...whisper something in his ear and pull away verrrry slooowwwly and look into his eyes and smile..even take a few glances at his lips..this will give him a sure sign that you are ready and willing for some lip action..if that doesn't work and the boy still doesn's attempt when you hug goodbye after an outing lean in and kiss his cheek..this should for sure get the ball rolling..he may be very shy to kiss, may not be a goodkisser or not ready yet..so give it a lil time then try to tips above!|`|8be2e73d38b08848e1928f7d763f74f8aa	sound like  a shy guy is the kinda guy whos gonna be yours.  He doesnt mention dating cuz he likes you too.. maybe he has another girl too, and wants more but who cares for now.    just go drinking with him one day and make a pass and blame it on booze if things go bad|`|ByNoUZmQaa	Well it sounds to me like he's deffinately interested but some men can be really afraid of making the first move incase they get knocked back. Be daring girl and make that first move if your to shy for that just stand really close to him and if your luck enough to be stood waiting somewhere then turn yourself into his look up at him and blink a lot .. but not to much then you look strange lot, blinking brings out the pupils if his dilate then he is attracted to you, most people lick there lips as a sign they want to kiss someone aswell so try that in a sexy sultry way, or if you see him doing it just go in for the kill try and kiss him at least that way you will know!|`|jNuSzeiMaa	This friend of yours is in love with you but scared to go further as he is not sure about your views about him and thinks that his next step may missfire and he may loose you. If you don't make the next move then this situation may continue for ever. So if you like him then make you move as he is deeply inlove with you and does not wish to loose you. Just for ONCE forget that the MAN has to PROPOSE. and moke your move.|`|4oEViPGmaa	how many long time se you can do
16ZP4oZxaa	first i feel disheartened to hear this - this is becoming a norm of life when one is in marriage for almost 8 plus years in marriage - i think you should change yourself before he makes up his mind - not to be rude but in all aspects from appearance - get a new hair cut - go soft on him - help him "indirectly" - change yr behaviour so that he doesnt have a hitch of why you are changing - but be vibrant and not have  the same style - the same thinking - the same behaviours and attitudes - its hard to write but if you wanna chat can contact me and explain to you - why? coz i have gone through the same with my wife.|`|NMqLFSAjaa	i have been married for 8 years and we have amazing sex, and the flare is gone now. the initial fun of the relationship always wears off, then your left with the other person.  if he cant find "it" in you he may go somewhere else to get it. watch your back hon.|`|a5b20edf16493d2642c8277814ff3916aa	Ah the spark...well 10 years is a long time...I would go out and get an make over and respark his interest.    Guys are funny though. My husband remembers this clingy top that I had vividly. I was a size 8 back then, it was slightly cropped, light powdery blue, kinda clubbing / dating top. I've since got rid of it but 6 years later, anything close to it in that color or shape sets off his memories and he thinks it's the same top!|`|ZQWU2Eoqaa	that is why it is called the "beginning", "new"  and not 10 years|`|IDYOH9Yraa	perhaps you may want to think back to how hings were when he craved you or may be explore his fantasies. ask him what he wants, he could either be bored, or tempted to go out there or may he has fallen out of love with you. I dont know honey, but this is one of those dreaded conversations you can't afford to avoid. Good luck!
PV4TVu23aa	well.. for me..  you should talk to ur bestfriend..    and ask her if what's with her and that boy..  tell her about your feeling..  you should be open to ur bestfriend.. :)    just tell her..|`|JXMVNEQoaa	CAT FIGHT!!!|`|dqsnA1zvaa	depends, not trying to sound mean, but if you liked him why didnt you go out or get him first?    if they liked eachother before you two started talking, then tehre isnt really anything you can do|`|lRaB01VTaa	beat her asssss.   thats a bitc* move.

aba0xGThaa	Handing over your number just seems arrogant but it some cases shows you mean business !! but asking for a number can be flattering ( if asked the right way ) it really all depends on the situation ... just never act to cock sure of yourself girls hate that!!|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I think most girls would rather get his number because when we give the guy our number and have to wait for a week for him to call (why do guys do that? Is there like some code that you can't call a girl in the first week?) the anticipation just KILLS us. *is he gonna call? Maybe he doesn't like me? Did i do something wrong??* it goes on and on. :P|`|H3304G6baa	Being that I never would be the one to make the first move, he'd better ask for my number or he'll never hear from me.|`|ZlTfLvidaa	Wouldn't mind seeing some answers to this...|`|XtzT6PHyaa	If a guy gives a girl his number and she calls to me that means she is intersed! Atleast that is what it would mean for me.  A gilr feels special if you ask for her number so gho for it!|`|a1qZVf3Uaa	I don't like receiving  's from guys.    Call me an old fashioned type of girl.    But the very first phone call should come from the guy. Even if I get a number from a guy and I am very interested in him, I would be too nervous to even dial the digits.    So to answer your question:  I like it when a guy gets my number and calls me within the week.  If he waits any longer than 3 weeks to call then I would think that there was another girl in which he was interested in, who turned him down and that I was second pickings.  7 days after giving my number out to a NEW fellow should be plenty of time for him to call me if he's interested.|`|ojLRdCjLaa	no the guy needs to ask for the girls number and tell her what time he will call that night. Because for most girls, they wont call if they get a guys number, even if they do like the guy.... just because they dont want t make the date and they want you to ask them out and take the interest and call them.      btw Im a girl (20)
Coc593Ikaa	Don't ask. Asking is NOT sexy.    Why does the kiss have to happen at the end of the date? Perhaps she is nervous and shy and that is why she doesn't look at you. If she shared that story with you and you cuddle other times, she probably is into you. Next time you "cuddle" up to her, even in the beginning or middle of your date, make your move! For you two, the kiss should come at at natural time such as that, when there is less pressure and expectation.     Good luck, I hope she like it! Oh, and don't wait too long, lest she think you are uninterested!|`|M5LqrwnUaa	Awwww. If you aren't sure wait a couple more dates. but if still nothing I'd ask    ' Is it ok if I kiss you?'  it will most likely work. She might like the fact that you asked her permission first before doing something she didnt' like.|`|b7eee9f19f8e24e494241b2544b861f0aa	if shes telling you something like tht and shes all emotional, don't ask, just do it. you'll know if its the right moment. in some situations tho, i think it would be kindda cute to ask. good luck! :)|`|ebfabf6203327b0913e8397c8eb10b83aa	You are a lovely guy according to my attractive lady friends (they're 24 and super fit) they read your question and made me write a reply because they think it's amazing. They told me that because you are a genuine and sweet guy you should kiss her in any way that feels right. Just do it soon. Stop doubting yourself make the move. Its scary but worth it! Good Luck.

Dating sites are good, ummmm if you are able to get out with friends you can be lucky enough to meet someone sometimes, chatrooms are a bad idea trust me.|`|ee99fab67e0c3a3d9db8854bdbc7bff7aa	well, boyfriends are nice, but you don't NEED one.  That said.. you'll have a time of it trying to find a guy around your age who wants to be with a 17 year old single mother!!  The mother thing is one thing, but the fact you're still a minor could also be quite offputting for guys.  I think you should get out, meet guys and date casually until you're 18, then it will be a lot easier for guys to deal with once you're an adult.   I know it gets lonely being single sometimes, but try not to settle for anything less than the best.  Be picky!!  I do have to say the internet is the worst possible place to look for a man.. There are a lot of pervs and predators out there who will come off as being all sweet and whatnot and then end up being psycho.  I hope Amber is not your real name!! NEVER EVER give out your real name online!!|`|ZfKxr8vZaa	i dont think you need a bf, guys are hassle - and you of all ppl no this lol     it will be very difficult trying to get a bf with a baby, most guys are doing to be looking for just sex anyway. soooo, my advice, make friends with guys, and expect nothing more. evuatually u should be able to wow them with ur amazing personality, and well as looks, and then, the matter of you having a baby is no longer a matter. when your at least friend, stuff like that isnt a problem...    hope that helps :)

Si tu lo q kieres es salir virgen y de blanco de tu casa y el no.......... pues alguien tiene que ceder........ y si alguno no cede........ es un antecedente para como resolver el sinnumero de dificultades y desacuerdos con los que se van a encontrar en su vida matrimonial.    Para mi en lo particular vivir en  union libre es algo muy bueno, asi no te atas desde el principio y te das un chance de saber como sera tu matrimonio si este se llega a concretar en el futuro.    Quiza para el si sea una prueba, lo importante es q te habla de si matrimonio pero un poco despues, quiza el quiere estar completamente seguro de a lo que va para "atarse" formalmente.

El tiempo que tengas con una pareja , no significa que  se amen mas, da lo mismo 1 mes a 10 a?os, no entiendo por que siguen midiendo el amor en a?os, aqu es claro que de plano tienen intereses diferentes..........y no creo que hicieran un buen matrimonio........SUERTE !!!|`|2wDJmluOaa	que razones te da el para vivir juntos sin casarse? que razones tienes tu para no querer vivir con el sin casarse?  en mi caso puedo decirte que para mi si tiene un significado el matrimonio, es como compartir con gente querida la union con tu pareja, en donde estan comenzando una vida en comun  sin embargo el acto del matrimonio no te garantiza que seas mas o menos feliz que el hecho de solo vivir juntos, lo importante es el compromiso real que tengan cada uno hacia el otro, asi que te propondria que hables con el, que cada uno exponga sus razones pero sin tratar de convencer al otro|`|zYy33Iaqaa	Yo resolveria esta situacion negociando, es decir acepta vivir con el digamos un a?o, es bueno ambos se conoceran mas y si las cosas salen bien pues luego pon la fecha y se casan. El convivir juntos hara que tengan la oportunidad de conocerse mas, no es lo mismo estar de novios que convivir, no te esta probando , lo que quiere es que los dos se conozcan mas, acepta amiga

Then tell your friend that it is up to her whether she wants to date him. You need to move on with your life. You know what the best revenge is? Looking great and feeling great. Put on a smile because he will think you will be crying and sad. Then he will wonder the rest of his life if he made a really big mistake lying to you. And don't ever date him again. Make it a lesson learned.|`|dGYZzh6Jaa	deal with it,you're the one that broke up with him.|`|PgCVD4osaa	suck it up and live with it really like i know how you feel it sucks but hey if there happy then you know besides you'll find some one better|`|Vnd6NnCCaa	Your friend shouldnt go near him.he is your ex now and if she got with him then that would just be wrong.|`|GU2pyhLyaa	trust me, i have been in a very similiar circumstance, if you want to stay friends with your friend, they need to not be together, if your friend goes out with him you'll grow jealous and it will make a sour relationship between you both, espescially if she begins tor really like him|`|qAlGowGOaa	best Friend?  best friends don't do that and as far as him saying he loves you well obviously he doesn't know what love is, and if your best friend gets hurts well i am sorry but she deserves it what the heck is she doing?  she should care about how you feel and she doesn't. neither one is worth it they both are ignorant and have no feelings about how you feel.  besides if they do get together it won't last cause it is just completely stupid to loose a friend over a guy or vice versa. you need new friends|`|aOzmaDshaa	what is over is over..his not over you thats y he wants to be with your friend is to get to you..but they wont last thats for sure but you should move on too.........try listening to (little miss obsessive) by ashlee simpson...goodluck..if she likes him she will have your left overs so dont worry shes not worth it|`|DksCIAoxaa	well the best thing to do is tell your friend how you feel. if she's a true friend she will listen and he needs to know to. tell him to find someone that's not among your friends that you don't know so you don't have to worry about your friends getting hurt by him|`|geNbmxaXaa	Just tell her you mind seeing her with him. Friends will never jeopardize their friendship for the sake for just a guy. If she doubt she can do it, then avoid them both while you do some soul searching and to learn to control your feelings since you broke up with him and he is none of your concerns anymore.

If you are under 18, you should let your teachers know about this and they will contact the proper authorities to get you out of this mess and get your mom the help she needs.  It is possible that your mom was also abused and this is the only way that she knows how to deal with you.  She just needs to be taught that there are other ways to deal with young people.    Good luck.|`|4KbYMdluaa	It sounds as if your mom has set the residence for behavior around, despite the person, i.e. friend or boyfriend....regardless, your mother shouldn't be hitting you, you may need to talk to someone, if your in school, talk to a teacher or counselor, if your out of school already call someone in family service or local law, if you feel this could escalate to a dangerous level. Now if your boyfriend has behaved in a way that you would consider disrespectful, and you say you do respect her, then he must also and you need to insist on this with him, if he's unwilling, then you have an important decision to make. good luck, sweetie, you have a tough job ahead of you.|`|T8DBB0wPaa	wait what? lock him up? how can she lock him up? and tell him its ok to joke around her just remember shes your mom and not to disrespect her....she shouldnt be hitting anyone first of all...but your bf needs to also have respect. maybe he should apologize for it start fresh and see how that goes|`|7uMaTxwlaa	Your mother beats you and locks you up!?

6fd2c28eb3e509484d0ed8894683b2f5aa	Don't close off, don't close up and don't close down. Remain open and approachable, trusting and trustworthy. Your faith in human nature has been dented lately by the behaviour of certain awkward individuals. But you cannot extrapolate this into an expectation that everyone is going to let you down. Nor can you be at your best whilst bristling with fury or hiding behind some big psychological barrier. Let down your guard and allow for the possibility of help from someone genuinely generous.     llloolloolloo lloolloolloo|`|ZWuLRV9Iaa	You are dealing with a dangerous thing because if you decide to cut all ties to quickly he may end up harming you, l suggest you get away from him slowly and it will eventually happen..am sorry that you are losing a friend to anything evil, praying to God to save his soul is a good thing too|`|IM9A3i03aa	Wow, make sure this kid doesn't show up to school with a gun, it sounds like he fits the profile of some one that would do that. Second let him know you don't want to be around him when he's like that butif he really needs a friend, that your there for him.|`|kO7RgBBOaa	Of course try and try to help him. Try using reverse psychology or something. Remember that telling him won't be enough no matter how many times you tell him. Realization is the only thing that can change him. Make him realize that he's wrong and converting to a satanist from christian is a very sad excuse and really weak to look at. He converted because of a grudge? That's really a sad excuse, you should tell him that.|`|a5f953be88e6808fa3af2ed7c0fd0aa2aa	Ummmm, hey.  I am not freaked out by Satanists because they hold as much power as the crazy guy that lives next door and worships his dead pillow.      Anger is what you need to be nervous of not the religious source.  If he was angry and now he is labelling it, at least he is dealing with it, sort of.      There are no spells for Satanism , that is Wicca.  Satanism is just not believing in God - anti god.  My daughter believes in God and she is a selfish, overbearing, ***** that might kill me in my sleep but that doesn't mean she is a Satanist, it just means she is a teenager.|`|AIuON6bBaa	He's not a satanist,deep inside he's crying out to be heard and be noticed,the satanist thing i think is really an extreme way of him saying please look at me..............if people take notice of him and treat him kindl then i think the devil will have packed up and gone to hell, on his pat malone.|`|Lcym6UFpaa	He does not know what he is dealing with and you need to cut all ties bigtime|`|FV2MO9sPaa	Eeek!    Lol.. that's scary.. I'm kinda freaked out now!     Get him help! Advise a counsellor or something! Maybe a therapist?!|`|KrvR2SRgaa	Scary!|`|uBYPdzuHaa	I had a roommate once who came out of no where as a satanist. Within a few months we had a bible, a satanist bible and some catholic book in our apartment.     My roommate got a giant tattoo of satan on his back and kinda lost himself but eventually he started to act like himself again just  was into his religion. He toned it down around other people and it was easier to deal with.    I would suggest you handle it with love. Show him you love him and care no matter what religion he choses. It could be just a phase as many people tend to go through. Especially if he is talking about "black magic" I would suggest you tread lightly and do not bring up the topic unless he does.    Sadly all you can do is be a friend and hope for the best. If you believe in prayer pray for him and if you don't then just send good vibes. Trying to talk him out of it or telling him he is wrong in his thinking could make him angry and that is the last things you want since most people who go through this phase turn to it out of anger and may not get out if he stays angry.|`|9obfv7Lcaa	I'm an atheist .. so to me Christians, Satanists, and all other types of cultists are pretty much the same.  I feel it's all immature fantasies people use to justify their actions and use as shields to make themselves feel strong.    If the person has a good heart and doesn't wish harm on others .. and practices that belief, I'm ok with them.  Everyone believes a lot of nonsense that isn't true, including me .. but it's when people have evil in their hearts and wish harm on others .. no matter who they pray to .. that's the end of the road for me.      So, if somebody is dropping bombs in Jesus' name or planting curses in Satans' I keep away from them.    To be clear, however, a True Satanist is just somebody who uses that label to freak out Christian and conformist types.|`|AA10146150	I agree he has no clue what he is doing. sounds like he is reaching out for attention. Give him all you can, see what is wrong with him and he will get over it soon. and you can't just suddenly decide to worship a different god. look up some stuff online and ask him bout it, if he has no clue what you are talking about chances are he is looking for attention, if he does then he probably did the same research you did. for starters make sure he knows that satanism isn't about demons and all that make believe stuff, it is way deeper.|`|8VtJDZaNaa	Jeez I saw this very pretty girl looking to hook up on a website who was into that too. I thought it was a sick joke of some type.     I honestly don't know if you posted this in the right location. Maybe try the psychology board.

DfaiuJo7aa	so far 5 years  i hung up on her for being verbally abusive and she wont talk to me any more  i hung up on her in 2003  lol    i hate to stereotype so i will not say anything about blond hair or her polish heritage|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Like... 5 years or something.    she was a ***** who treated me like garbage. When I finally realized this I decided I didnt want to be friends with her any more... she's not the type to change. We've been oging to the same school since then, but she has never really changed. She spent a lot of years trying to steal my friends from me. I think it took her al ong time to get over it. She has always been quite mean to me, even though I treat her like every one else. (Even though she's the one who ruined so many years of my life.) she's been a bit nicer to me this year, but i still can;t wait until next year when we go to different schools and she'll be out of my life. She made me really learn the meaning of the words "hate" and "enemy". She was horrible to me for al ong time. The thing thqt bothers me about her is she's friends with a lot of my friends so she hangs out with me at recess.|`|2xl1ab2waa	ok let me tell u something...  if u  were in a fight with ur friends for a long time without talking or trying to solve ur problems then for sure u r not friends because u don't care about ur friendship....  so if u really care about this friend u need to go talk to him/her and discuss what u both did wrong ...  i have experience in this and it hurts a lot... so take this step before he/she does to show ur interest.  hope that i helped or answered the question right ^_^|`|wQ3WVfhkaa	1 week  I forced my friend to go out with us to the beach and he was a moma's boy and can't,He was soo scared dat he cried...    after that,he didnt speak to me for a week..|`|t8WzswuXaa	3 months over some    B---S|`|gqPCx4yMaa	45 min. we cant stay mad at each other for long and we end up fixing things eventually
AxGkn7JAaa	if he's not ready to marry he's not ready to marry or be in a serious relationship. Maybe you should let him go and find someone else if you really want a serious relationship. It's not bad for him to just want to live life. But if that's not in your plan you might want to find someone more compatible to you.|`|XbJCCg4Raa	everyone has his/her own personality and point of view in life. it his choice in how to live his life, anyways its his life. if he doesnt want you in it then it better for you, you know now you are not that important to him and not to waste your time on him. but dont judge him for what he did. we are all individuals.|`|oXKLf3hMaa	you just need to find a different guy, it sounds like.|`|VO9CNXajaa	if you think you like it and you know you and him will benifit go with him but dont do it if you or him wont like do things that both of you like and you may have a happy long loving relation ship|`|C76qRcafaa	that may be code for , he wants to see other women. Men get scared when they feel tied down to one women. They think "wow , if this really is it, i'll never have sex with anyone ever again"   He probably needs a change. It's nothing against you. the fantasy of "living his life" may wear off, and he might realize that he belongs with you.... or you may just find someone else. Don't wait around for him though.

Es extra?o como tu misma sabes y mencionas que vales mas que todas esas humillaciones, si ya lo sabes, no entiendo porque no pones punto final a esa situacion,  en este caso TU Y SOLO TU tienes la solucion, valorate, quierete, amate, recuerda que la vida no gira en torno a una persona, si el no te ama, creeme que conoceras a alguien que te amara y que SEGURO sera mejor para ti, recuerda que Dios es sabio y tiene a la persona indicada para ti.

My ex isn't even allowed to pick my child up from school because he never went to court.|`|AA10539411	no idea  but go ahead and get a lawyer.......  do you have a pre existing custody agreement with the courts if so get that out?  make sure your employed and start creating a list of people that could be character references for you    I'd say typically you have the better chance   your the mother, you have been taken care of your son anyways and he's more familiar with you and he's in school  however its better to face all your battles as your going in for a loss|`|lM8kzsiPaa	I'd say slim to none.  Unless you are a gutter sl**, and a crack whore.  He'd have to have a really good reason to go for custody.  Good luck|`|0a501Chxaa	dont wait. get to a lawyer ASAP and start getting paper work filled out now. think of everything you can to keep the kid from her. dig up court papers if you can. anything will help you.|`|991146638678f26245b579afbf192da3aa	The courts would act in the best interest of the child which would be you looking  having full custody.I would get a good lawyer if I was you and start the ball rolling .His chances of custody are nil sibce he has not seen much of his son.Is he paying child support?|`|N3ewZ6pPaa	hah, if their was a good chance-she would pretty muchscrew it up for him anyways-no worries, he wont get custody unless hecan prove you unfit but just incase, i would start recording phone conversations so that her behaviour can be recorded.............|`|hJVo639Zaa	not good, as a child of divorce myself i know the court actually does something right in cases like this. you shouldnt have a problem and if they ask to talk to your son, let them! its you that has been taking care of him, he doesnt even know his father and hes not going to want to live with a stranger. best of luck and im sure everything will be fine :)|`|d0505ec79e987a99ac705a855225c9c2aa	Slim.  Just make sure you keep your nose clean.  i.e. keep on your toes about what you say to ex and son.

I wouldn't say you should start eating unhealthy if you don't want to.|`|OuQVuY2gaa	hmmm maybe if ur too skinny its never bad to put on a few pounds|`|TnnHswx7aa	Who cares, that kicks ***. It means you can eat icecream and other yummy stuff with wanton abandon unlike the rest of us women ;.;|`|vZ8Py3lqaa	Why not?!|`|pqSkHmrXaa	I don't think his race is an issue, but he's probably into big butts. Or, if you're underweight, he just wants you to be healthy. There's such a thing as too skinny, you know. ^_^ If your weight is healthy, don't worry about it. No sense risking health for a turn on.

2wDJmluOaa	los anillos van por numero, relacionado con el diametro del dedo, tal vez suene tonto pero te especifico tu novia como eran los 6 centimetros? muchas veces coincide el largo con el diametro pero no forzozamente y alguna vez ya me toco ver un caso en donde dieron la medida del largo no del diametro asi que checa primero eso   puedes utilizar una referencia, por ejemplo si ella usa anillos pontelo como jugando y checa en que dedo te queda o que tan apretado o con alguna servilleta enrollale el dedo igual jugando y despues guardas la servilleta con la medida (no la vayas a dejar en tu pantalon cuando lo laves eh!)  suerte!!!|`|WBNLM21Vaa	Trata de conseguir un anillo de ella|`|CSL5PEFPaa	mmmm robale un anillo por unos dias, despues lo devuelves, si no nunca sabran eso hizo mi futuro marido, y se evito de broncas... o midete un anillo de ella, fijate bien como te queda y cuando lo compres, fijate que quede mas o menos igual, y listo!|`|e6c4acd18367eccac18b43389deeead6aa	No son 6 cm es mas bien, del numero 6, te mando esta informacin espero que te sea til, y lo que yo te podra recomendar es que fuera totalmente una sorpresa, que te dir que uno de mujer para esas cosas tenemos radar, jajaja por eso mismo te digo que lo hagas muy diferente, tal vez la invites a cenar algn lugar muy lindo y te pongas de acuerdo con el mesero y que se lo ponga en el postre... bueno de todo eso te encargas tu y tu imanacin o ingenio ya que tu la conoces mejor que yo.  MUCHAS FELICIDADES Y SUERTE|`|QQ0bsP74aa	La verdad no importa el que elijas siempre y cuando les guste a ambos.  Y me cas y usamos anillos de plata, ya que el oro no me gusta porque debe obtenerse por un  proceso que contamina demasiado al ambiente, adems requiere mucha energa de quien lo porte ya que levanta muchas miradas y eso..  Lo cierto es que uso de plata, un poco grueso a plano, de paso lo uso en el dedo medio o ndice ya que en el anular me molestaba y no pude usarlo all.    Tal vez no te ayud mucho con mi respuesta pero el que elijas ser el mejor.  Ya debes conocer un poco mejor los gustos de tu futura esposa, as que elije bien.    Salud y felicidades en tu matrimonio... a mi me ha ido de maravillas desde que me cas.    Fernando  www.frinconalejos.ws

El sexo es un juego con una amplia variedad de gamas pero generalmente nos restringimos a lo ms normal, lo ms comn. Intenta experimentar algo nuevo. Pero antes de experimentar cosas o detalles nuevos, mejor platica con tu pareja sobre lo que le gustara hacer durante el sexo y de sus fantasas sexuales. Si solo usan el gris para escribir, no podrn usar toda la paleta de colores para variar su vida.    Lo que a ti te trae mal es que se lo tengas que decir. Ni modo: en eso nadie ms te puede ayudar. Habla de lo que t quieres, lo que sue?as con hacer y pregntale lo mismo. Pero no cometas el error de decirle: "esto se est volviendo montono". Slo platcale de lo que quisieras. Eso ayudar.    Saludos

Lo importante aqui es el bienestar de tus hijos y si ellos no viven en un ambiente de armonia y seguridad, creo que definitivamente por el bien de ellos te debes divorciar. Esa excusa de que por tus hijos no te divorcias, te obliga a soportar situaciones que no te dejan vivir en paz ni a ti ni a tu pareja. te aconsejo que hables con el y que lleguen a un acuerdo donde los mas beneficiados sean tus hijos SUERTE!|`|owQqtK27aa	Primeramente debes estar completamente seguro de si no amas a la persona con la que estas, no tomes las cosa apresuradas todo tiene solucion y se llega a un acuerdo, lo malo siempre de esto es que los hijos sufren las consecuencias de los actos de los padres, hay que tomar las cosas con calma y dialogar para arreglar la situacion matrimonial o  el divorcio....saludos y bye|`|JcogXzDDaa	Estar con alguien que no amas no es bueno para tus hijos. Pero hay que estar muy seguro de que no tiene solucion la crisis antes de tomar la desicion de separarse o divorciarse.|`|rRzHnoViaa	La verdad si tienes problemas muy fuertes, como discusiones, etc. lo mejor es la separacin, pues les hace ms da?o a los hijos esta situacin que esten separados.|`|lCaFw3fwaa	Es mejor divorciarse explicndoles que los papis dejaron de ser buenos amigos y... como cuando tu discutes con un amigo y no te llevas bien, los papis debern hacer lo mismo para evitar que el ambiente se torne hostil y feo para su crecimiento.    Es importantsimo aclararles a los hijos que se los sigue amando igual y que ellos no son los responsables de la separacin, ms por el contrario, se vern beneficiados porque los papis se llevarn muchsimo mejor, sin pelear ni discutir cada da.    Para mi el tema de los hijos es una gran excusa por el miedo natural que se siente a plantearse una nueva vida "solo"... volver a empezar casi de cero, con el agravante que dejas a tus ni?os en manos de la ex.      Pero a vivir un calvario, mejor cortar por lo sano y cuanto antes mejor, as haces uso del derecho que tienes a rehacer tu vida.|`|J6uWHsNeaa	creo que si, valorate un poco y quierete,ya veras que solita estaras mejor y podras sacar a delante a tus hijos|`|1e5b8e5772d9a3fa87fba6d60d7a56ddaa	porque te quieres divorciar , debemos de ver lo elementos que te llevan a querer tomar esa decision que le afectara a todos pero mas a los ninos que si sufren con el divorcio de sus padres y tienen que pasar por las transiciones y nuevas vidas de cada uno , piensalo .|`|D5QMZ0Llaa	Yo no estoy de acuerdo en seguir al lado de alguien si ya no lo amas y nadamas se hacen da?o, lo mejor seria separarse y rehacer su vida, los hijos a fin de cuentas se van a ir y nos dejaran solos.|`|yzL8hPN2aa	Yo comet ese error y la verdad no vale la pena invertir tanto para finalmente no obtener nada; adems que tambin los hijos pierden mucho porque absorben todas las tensiones de ambos.|`|kq9QzP2Iaa	Es mejor el divorcio.

Fingir situaciones y sentimientos poniendo como excusa lo que uno supone que querran los hijos o quien sea es una hipocresa y una fuente de sufrimiento y posterior angustia para todos los involucrados.|`|2wDJmluOaa	yo creo que lo mejor para los hijos es ver que entre sus padres hay comunicacion y respeto, asi que si van a estar juntos peleando, ignorandose, agrediendose o incluso llegar hasta infidelidades pues creo que si es mejor que se separen  no forzozamente unos padres juntos son lo mejor y si consideramos el hecho del ejemplo que se da a los hijos creo que es mejor que vean que pueden hablar, llegar a acuerdos y llevar una vida tranquila y feliz

Si tu no quieres casarte por bienes mancomunados por bienes separados, cuando adquieran una propiedad o algo de mayor valor si el lo desea que lo ponga a tu nombre y solamente por este regimen es totalmente tuyo.
