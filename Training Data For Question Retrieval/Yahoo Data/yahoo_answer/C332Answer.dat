EioOPbzbaa	Now my husband, we met at work - I was delivering parts to his production line and couldn't find where they belonged.  After much frustration he walked around the corner and it has been intense love ever since.  Been together for 17 years now and going strong.|`|wZD9KJaFaa	Well, we actually just split a week or two ago..but I like our story, and we're still good friends right now so I want to share.<br>  My freshman year of college at UConn (I'm now a junior), he lived in the same building as me a few floors down.  There was a "sex party" once night in our building's lobby, where an organization called "sexperts" came to talk with us about being safe and all that sex talk.  A few people volunteered and made two teams to play a game.  The game was teaching us how to unwrap a condom properly and put it on a penis.  There was a wooden penis, and we were on different teams.  We both went up to put the condom on the penis at the same time, both the last people on our team..and I kicked his butt.  It was a pretty intense game, and later on I enjoyed breaking his balls about the "penis game" (we're both very competitive).  We didn't end up dating until a few months later, but that's where it all started.  We were together for a little over a year and a half.  Sad, I know.|`|0zdHykkSaa	I met my husband when we worked together at walmart. The first time we saw each other... it was love at first site.<br>  still together 7 years later!|`|rGXrh38aaa	I met my boyfriend in Starbucks in London lol and we have been together for nearly 6 months now.|`|A15bfvkBaa	High-school, and for almost 2 years =] =] =]|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Don't have one???<br>  <br>  Cause I don't get out much and guys don't seem interested in me.|`|Ed2DGWkeaa	i met my b/f at school and we've been together for a year and a month|`|B83DTe78aa	Oh....you mean my imaginary one...?

I was 16, he was 18. We've been together for 6 years. we're engaged, and we just bought a house <br>  <br>  <3|`|yVZR0N0Haa	At the bar|`|7foornMVaa	I meet him when he was 10 and I was 15. He was my brothers friend and I didnt even give him a second thought. (he was a little kid and my brothers dorky friend)  I periodically saw him for the next 20 years but then he moved back down here and hung around with my brother more and more.  We started just chit chatting but still nothing which was fine with me. Then my heater broke in my house and he came over to fix it for me. I was getting ready to eat and offered him some too.  When he was done eating  and fixing my heater he decided he wanted to hang out. I was comfortable with him so it was no big deal. Then when I was in the kitchen, he came in to throw something away and he looked down at me and then tried to kiss me. I backed away twice while he still kept coming. He landed the kiss and said it was a "thank you for the food."  whatever.<br>  We have been together for 3 years and have a son.  Weird how things work out.|`|VJpdmd0waa	Met my fiance on Myspace- been together 3 years|`|P8uh4joQaa	I met her at a domino's about a year ago and have been together since two weeks after we met. you wouldn't believe how stalkerish I had to get to find her again after I met her. at least she thinks its cute and not creepy haha.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I am single and staying that way because I need to concentrate on myself and stop being abused and try to go to school-even though I know I never will because I have a disability and NO ONE WILL HELP ME|`|3yNh5jO8aa	husband- i met him in jr. high, but we didn't date until college and didn't get married until after college.|`|B3N388wBaa	We met at a library.<br>  <br>  It'll be 17 months this Saturday! =D

u2lYbPT2aa	I think that is a bunch of hog wash, bring males up to think<br>  they should never cry!!!  Everyone has emotions, and feelings!!<br>  Why should men have to hide their feelings??  They get sad, too!!<br>  They have their moments, when they feel all is going wrong!!<br>  I have never heard of something so absurd, ever!! It is like Germans, and not showing their love!! Well, I can't speak for all Germans, but<br>  my family is German, and showing their love, or feelings, was completely out of the question!! I turned it around, and have shown my love, and feelings for my daughter, all her life, and when she walks out the door...she knows she is supremely loved, with all my heart!!<br>  Just because a man has a good cry, doesn't affect how manly he is!!<br>  In fact, I see a man, more manly, for not trying to hide his feelings!!<br>                           LOVE&LIGHT,  xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|trMsK86jaa	I cried all my tears out when i was still a boy.<br>  <br>  I cried for the pain i would endure within this life.<br>  <br>  I have no more tears for myself, only for others.|`|EZdRYJXraa	I'm doing it since some months and not because I wanted to but because it's what life brings sometimes.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	only if theres somebody to hug|`|Ed2DGWkeaa	it's easy to make my b/f cry... well sometimes...|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Crying is not unmanly at all and i have cried and will again.|`|yD152y92aa	...yes I know that feeling :(|`|P8uh4joQaa	I did this last week. I needed it, I felt better.|`|URvhlHmeaa	Im not a man but Id respect a man who did that if he needed to. We all, men AND women,feel emotional pain. Most cultures teach that a man is weaking for crying but thats bull,men have tear ducts too so let them use 'em when they need to,thats what I say|`|YWwtiIgTaa	yes, only once when my dear one died.|`|ART35qSuaa	I think it's heartbreaking to see a man cry, but i love the fact that some men aren't afraid to show the true emotions.<br>  <br>  i cry sometimes, after it makes me feel better.|`|c3j49t9Faa	Crying has nothing to do with being manly.<br>  Some of the biggest ******* don't cry because they are scared to face their feelings, which means they are scared of themselves. Not too manly to me.|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	everyone needs to do that once in a while regardless of their sex<br>  <br>  go for it if you need it, you ll feel so light <br>  <br>  i think i ll go for one soon|`|PPs521xDaa	Yeah but I just spend a half an hour with a punching bag and I don't need to anymore.|`|swQz4R2Iaa	Yes, to be honest i think im different from that period in my life|`|naI5hGjHaa	i think it's healthy to break down and cry once in awhile and let it all out|`|xIB7Aujdaa	i m too attached to my parents and my sis. only they can mak me cry in this world.|`|aAxIERtUaa	I have done it but not because I wanted to.|`|KsklH4mQaa	lulu your mean!|`|AA11596713	ohhh yeah i do.. and i'm pretty manly.|`|uyqUTLjFaa	No.|`|ztn0LcSFaa	no I think not needed|`|CYhOr4s7aa	a real man has no problem showing his emotions ,|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	yep and I do from time to time we're only human|`|8vvnEeK5aa	Yes, but I don't think I'm manly, I'm actually a pretty feminine guy.|`|iuB1k63baa	i cry alot<br>  lately and my ex does too|`|310i8CKZaa	There is nothing wrong with crying.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Ive seen my husband cry more than once.. so yes its good to cry but also i have cried with him.. embracing each other and just lettin it go.|`|oFv3v9Oeaa	Absolutely yes.<br>  If I didn't, I'd be worried.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	yeah - 10 minutes ago my question didnt post :(  ?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I am a woman so I don't care!!!!!!!!!!!

B43x5RF8aa	I thought it was good. It was definitely the best one since at least part IV. It took it back to being more scary than stupid!<br>  <br>  The Texas Chainsaw massacre remake was good also and it was directed by the same guy who directed Friday|`|maQazFTKaa	I forgot that Jason ran in the Part 2, 3, and 4....but I think what made him really terrifying was the fact that he moved slowly, but steadily, and he always got his kill.<br>  <br>  I wish there had been more people...and Jason chaining up the girl just because she had on his mother's necklace? Made no sense.<br>  <br>  I did think it was surprising that one of the main characters was killed. But I did like how they gave nods to Jason's previous kill techniques.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Didn't see it yet but actually want to see it.|`|yVZR0N0Haa	It was good.|`|3Y3YF4noaa	it was pretty sweet|`|qISeJl3Naa	I will see the movie when it goes on dvd|`|SKFIjyoVaa	idk, a part of me kinda died inside when he started running<br>  and when did jason become an olympic class archer?

wZa3qiSbaa	I love that show I like that show more than Real Chance of love  for some reason ... I think cause it got sexy a$$ Ray J making the girls do crazy stuff and it really seems he's truly looking for love and this doesn't appear to be some fake reality show , that VH1 has wasted their money on other previous shows in the past... but I think LiL Hood is gonna be next ..she's annoying and try to act like she's black..but really making a fool of herself and Ray J can see right through all that|`|MqOq21Luaa	Lil Hood is definitely the next to go. She is all over him, and you can tell he's not into her. <br>  <br>  I think Danger or Cocktail might win it. <br>  <br>  Good show|`|UaPyRDhzaa	I do like the show but I missed the last one with them singing? I've been trying to find out who got eliminated. I want Danger to get kicked off.|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	I have to admit that I am hooked.  I think Cashmere is going to win it, and Feisty or Lil' Hood are out the door next.|`|cen8SIssaa	Me too!! but thats a tough one...i think Lil hood should be sent home b/c she seems like the classic groupy girl.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i love that show too i think lil hood should be kicked off next

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>   A Mom is driving a little girl to her friends house for a play date.<br>  <br>  "Mommy," the little girl asks, "how old are you?"<br>  <br>  "Honey, you are not supposed to ask a lady her age," the mother warns. "It is not polite."<br>  <br>  "OK," the little girl says, "How much do you weigh?"<br>  <br>  "Now really," the mother says, "these are personal questions and are really none of your business."<br>  <br>  Undaunted, the little girl asks, "Why did you and daddy get a divorce?"<br>  <br>  "That is enough questions, honestly!" The exasperated mother walks away as the two friends begin to play.<br>  <br>  "My Mom wouldn't tell me anything," the little girl says to her friend.<br>  <br>  "Well," said the friend, "all you need to do is look at her drivers license. It is like a report card, it has everything on it."<br>  <br>  Later that night the little girl says to her mother, "I know how old you are, you are 32."<br>  <br>  The mother is surprised and asks, "How did you find that out?"<br>  <br>  "I also know that you weigh 140 pounds."<br>  <br>  The mother is past surprise and shock now. "How in heavens name did you find that out?"<br>  <br>  "And," the little girl says triumphantly, "I know why you and daddy got a divorce."<br>  <br>  "Oh really?" the mother asks. "Why?"<br>  <br>  "Because you got an F in sex."|`|c3svN3Evaa	funny

8q5SeYueaa	If they were blind from birth, their dreams are only audible. If they had sight, their dreams are in color, but it's limited by how much they've seen.<br>  <br>  It's pretty trippy to think about it. If we are limited by what we've seen in life, that means there could be colors, or objects, out there that we can't even imagine because we've never seen them.<br>  <br>  And seriously, when I try to imagine some crazy creature, every body part is just a mixture of things I've seen before.

jTrZfcGsaa	Yeah! :D<br>  I'm just sort of an openminded person, I suppose; I like the calm, acoustic stuff, and I love grunge, where the screechy feedback is a primary source of most of the sound, and Jimi for the somehow simple intricacy - and I like a bunch of rap and techno because of the bass.<br>  I love the feel the bass gives you, how you can sort of feel the thump of it throughout your whole body. <br>  Believe it or not, any musical composition takes talent. Even if it's made with a drum machine and a synthesizer, it must be written and made interesting; there is always a person behind it who puts their heart and soul into what they do, and that is what's important about music.|`|DaXu6JMDaa	i like basshunter...and although it might seem fake its really good to dance to...|`|UF7H4CQ2aa	its just different <br>  i think it can even get people pumped and it has alot of bass witch just makes it a lil more interesting too<br>  <br>  i like..darude-sandstorm, bass hunter- all i ever wanted, dj caffeine- on the floor
YuS6sidMaa	wow he is a ******* pr!ck like seriously. my sister works for Coinstar and she said finding a 1943 is pretty rare though unless they are copper they are worthless. he is very rude and by saying he would give someone an 'A' for a rare penny he thought he was being cool then when you met the challenge he had to lie so he wouldn't look bad! sorry that happened but he is a rude, unfair a$$ in my opinion|`|4YnoykD2aa	Not rude, but very unfair.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Your teacher is a jerk and you are a fool to fall for his idiotic offer. Any "A"s worth having are worth working for. There are no true shortcuts in life.|`|6ClURMmWaa	well either<br>  1) He thought he said copper<br>  2) he didnt actually think anyone would find the 1943 penny<br>  <br>  You should tell him he didnt say copper, and ur classmates agree with you.|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Very rude. I guess he wasn't expecting someone to have one?<br>  I think he should honor what he said.|`|djuRlggeaa	I think that your "teacher" isn't a good teacher. That's what I think.|`|DcUoZntOaa	yes it is. you produced, now it is the teachers turn. good luck with that 1.<br>  peace!|`|JSl1jAPQaa	No, it doesn't sound rude.|`|hfqUp1IBaa	You should have been smarter than to think that he would actually give you an A.  Clearly he could get fired over that and a penny would not be worth it.  I think that you are more upset because he embarassed you and made you look like a fool!|`|pYomxgYfaa	It is rude. <br>  <br>  He didn't think anyone would have a penny from that year, and now that you do, he doesn't want to give you the A.|`|1CVFq4dsaa	hun it's not rude, teachers are jerks =\|`|obFG9EXGaa	shutup bytch|`|dgGtwSIzaa	I agree ! If he just said Penny then THAT should do .. GRR I hate when techers do that !!!|`|AA11969873	thats bull|`|pRxzPiSbaa	of course he's going to back out. you won't win this battle.|`|BjmJharpaa	lol he wasnt expecting anyone to actually have it so when you did bring it it he had to say something else<br>  they cant just give you A's for bringing in old pennies =P<br>  although that would be nice..|`|edCUawppaa	Sounds like he didnt want to give you an A.  <br>  <br>  That was pretty mean though, maybe you should talk to him after class about it.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Hahaha.  A teacher can't just give you an A for bringing in a penny.  He was obviously joking.  Get over it lol.|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Obviously here your teacher is a penis head.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	He's a teacher, therefore he is difficult to work with.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	he was most lickely joking when he said to bring that in for an A....meaning he didnt mean it|`|bQCfOftxaa	just a misunderstanding - not rude|`|olopisx7aa	Yes, it sounds rude. Don't know what his problem is. Maybe male pms.|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	I think those are worth $$$$$$, he just wanted someone to bring him one!|`|TanepNjdaa	Lol he probably didnt think anyone was really goin to go out of thier way to actually go and find one. I think that he was rude for not giving you an A for at least trying. It shouldn't of mattered what it was made out of. it was just the year that he wanted.... Im glad I didnt have a teacher like that...|`|b39Rs8sLaa	yes very rude i belive you and if it wasnt he didnt have to say DID NOT <br>  i think hes a grown up twat from ur point..|`|jeYi7APraa	your teacher is an ***. LMAO|`|h0rWnvx1aa	I think that iz rude because he never said it had to be a certain one. He just said for it to be a 1943 penny. He does have some kind of problem. You also should still get an A because you did what he said. So dont think what you did was wrong. He just has problems.|`|yoG66LeYaa	sounds like he wanted to make a joke out of you.|`|AA11106675	Not rude.  He probably didn't expect anyone to come up with one, so he thought he was safe making the offer.  Then you did find one.  He really can't give you an A in a chemistry class for finding an old penny, so he had to find a way out of it.|`|1RFB22eBaa	Yeah, that's rude.<br>  I think it's because he didn't actually expect anyone to bring one in, so when you did he had to come up with an excuse why he couldn't accept it.<br>  What ended up happening with the penny situation?|`|wU6Mn4sBaa	idk... he should hav made himself more clear|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	This is a case with most adults, my mom is one lol. He thought he said it but he didn't and he is not going to get over the fact he was wrong.|`|lmwVR1BGaa	Report him to the CIA or maybe the FBI.I think he works for Saddam Bin Laden.im serious.also,he is very rude.(whoever gave thumbs down should go fcuk themselves.no sense of humour)|`|YoybYsQpaa	It was probably a mean joke made by a mean teacher. Are pennies from 1943 made from copper? Ask him why he wont give you the credit for it.|`|MZP46xFqaa	nope, ur looking into it too much|`|59tRtkonaa	i would complain to the teacher off and walk out and go to the office because you are probally gonna end up there if u told the teacher off lol|`|wZNMlmglaa	I think it was very rude. Did you say that he didn't specify copper? thats actually really mean|`|f2c691cb03d9d6b21303d0a416f0ad3daa	Hes a teacher, what do you expect?|`|SzHa2Uf7aa	OBVIOUSLY he wasn't really going to give you an A in the class if you brought in the penny. If he did that, THAT would be rude. GAWD. You're an idiot! You'll only get an A in the class if you do hard work, and deserve it.|`|wSYhEREjaa	he's a douche bag teacher<br>  what do you expect?<br>  <br>  ?|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	It's very rude the 1943 copper penny is worth $10,000 so it's also unethical|`|xreWOKBYaa	I find it very strange that any teacher would offer an A for a marking period for kids bringing in money, even if it is only a penny.|`|553XVYwUaa	yes because they didnt have copper pennies in 1943

Woodchip was the worst as the first couple of pages which were leaning against the woodchip directly made it look like you writing with a broken hand.  I used to work in a DIY store and whenever I saw someone buying woodchip, I wanted to scream at them.  They could have bought lining paper for the same price and you won't traumatise your children with the dreaded bumpy jotter covering.  Woodchip on your jotters made me slightly envious of my friends who had nice wallpaper on their jotters and made me think that they were posh and had a nice house that didn't have bloody woodchip in it.<br>  <br>  Thanks for opening up old wounds there.

7rYwuN2uaa	from one of my personal favorite movies--anthony hopkins as hannibal lecter in ''silence of the lambs.'' he played the role to perfection; no one could have done it better. he just became the character and as sick as hannibal was, hopkins was tops doing it.|`|ajiv0Ix6aa	Will Smith - Doctor Robert Neville<br>  <br>  Ahh! Best actor/character combination ever! I believed this is how a man living in solitude would react if her indeed the last man on earth. Fit, intelligent, weary, and a bit delusional.

Interested in his own way, in his own world, of being a better person, of enjoying life. And so finally tragic even though Tarantino lets him walk off into the sunrise with Sam Jackson. <br>  <br>  Travolta plays each layer perfectly, never trying to do too much, just letting the character breathe. How much of that is Tarantino and how much Travolta we will probably never know for sure.

EOaFZoNtaa	because of our surroundings and everyone wants to fit in. even when you say you want to fit out your being like 30% of other teens. there's no conforming to yourself anymore.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Lmao... my dad used to have an old joke that reminds me of this question:<br>  <br>  An interviewer goes to a typical public high school in the 1940's and asks a teacher, "What are the biggest problems you face as a teacher in this school?" <br>  <br>  The teacher thinks for a second and then she replies, "Students who chew gum during class, students who interrupt their teachers, students who run in the hallways, and students who don't do their homework."<br>  <br>  Then, 60 years later, another interviewer goes to a typical public high school in the 2000's and asks a teacher the same question, "What are the biggest problems you face as a teacher in this school?"<br>  <br>  And the teacher replies, "Students bringing guns to school, students starting knife fights in the cafeteria, students dealing drugs in the bathrooms, and students threatening to bomb down the school."<br>  <br>  Lol.. I thought that was kinda funny. haha|`|RxnwN1Nvaa	Excuse me, but just as many adults are just as brainwashed.<br>  the majority of the world is somewhat brainwashed|`|LvAXeOcZaa	Good question. Maybe because the people they look up to everyday are too!|`|qpjorXRnaa	Is this a question, or an opinion, and an example please<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks|`|7MJSPGnhaa	because they get their information from the internet, celebrities and facebook/myspace...they believe whatever they read or are told to believe and they don't question anything or even really care.|`|4sW8MFxCaa	thanks buddy<br>  your not so bright yourself|`|a0d4a4ffd933a3a2f7653e20f5c5f577aa	Television, Internet, and Electronics.

Some people are different around people because they're scared of being rejected for who they are, or might be humiliated but people are sometimes themselves when there is a computer screen in the way of the relationship, and they feel more comfortable. :)|`|GXKn4NnJaa	no you're just looking in the wrong places|`|TWsxP46Qaa	no but its easy to weed out the ones who are|`|pC5SWxC3aa	No, were all at least 89.9% honest at all times.<br>  <br>  1) Does the statement above appears to be incorrect.

4UQegWk0aa	She dies when she is really really old. Like Jack said she would "an old lady, warm in her bed". It isn't meant to be a dream - that wouldn't make sense as the titanic did actually sink.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Lilith is right. she died|`|ph8lttZBaa	Erm, she died on her bed<br>  In the end it sums it all up, and she eventually joined Jack.<br>  That's what I understood anyway.|`|b1XStRqtaa	She threw the jewel in the water, went back to bed and died in her sleep.  Then her spirit met Jack on board the Titanic under the clock - and the others that died.  She died in bed an old lady just like Jack told her she would.|`|Qh01Ey7Daa	i think she was dead.  that's part of the thing jack said, "you're going to die and old, old lady, warm in her bed."<br>  <br>  i prefer to think that she dies the way he wanted her to.   :]|`|UPN3zqq6aa	not sure<br>  <br>  x|`|jUzcucmQaa	yeah i think|`|4idInZwoaa	I don't think she did|`|BJIo6twUaa	yes, she died of old age at the very end. It wasnt a dream. Her spirit joined the rest of the people on the Titanic, that was pretty much what the ending was showing.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	yes, she does die of old age at the end of the movie... i think after she throws the necklace in the ocean... she died of old age just like he told her he would...|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I didn't know some people thought she died...I always thought she lived but was dreaming the ending scene.<br>  <br>  Aw the ending makes sense now, so sweet <3|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I think she did cause Jack told her she would die an old lady warm in bed and that's how the movie ended.|`|olopisx7aa	No. She survived the sinking.|`|e9gsf1GJaa	duuuh.|`|IKpwMXTlaa	she died of old age.|`|ajiv0Ix6aa	It's pretty much a cliffhanger meant for the audience to decide. If you resolve that she died peacefully in her bed, then that's satisfactory for you, thus solidifying this damn good film experience. If you resolve it was just a dream brought about by the strong emotions she had on the vessel, then so be it. <br>  <br>  Personally I think she found solace in recounting the tale, finally being able to return to the place where he greatest love, and heartbreak took place. So yeah, I think she died.|`|HZqwuHPzaa	Well until now I was sure that she just met Jack at the end in her sleep, but maybe as the others said, she really dies in the bed at the end of the film and her spirit meets Jack. But before this if you would have asked me,I would have said she was just sleeping at the end and she lived after that for some time...|`|ygMAqg4qaa	Strange this movie was just on TBS today-- I was wondering what people thought because I had always assumed she died in her sleep as an old lady as Jack tells her... 10+ years later, I'm still crying after watching it. <br>  So yes, she dies--that's what we're supposed to believe and they set it up so it's sort of obvious-- like the post above mine, her life has come full-circle: everything she says she wants to do, she does ( from the pics on her nightstand). After she passes, she sees only those who died on the ship--the unsinkable Molly Brown is not there, her mother is not there, Cal ( though he may have gone to hell lol), and others. <br>  Also I picked up on some obvious symbolism--she drops the jewel, the "heart of the ocean" of whatever it's called, into the water to be "with " the Titanic again. Thus is symbolizes Rose's heart also going back to the Titanic, then later that night she follows the necklace and she is with her Jack again in Titanic-heaven. Just think, he was waiting for her all this time!! Here we go with the tears again, a tissue, please!!|`|9e362da026600c90bb20cbf82c4b281aaa	no she doesnt die at the end of the movie  shes actually telling the story to someone...maybe someone painting her pic or something...not someone is helping her pack and they came across a painting or photo and she proceeds to tell the story....so beautiful....if you like that one watch "The Notebook"|`|pEDavW3caa	no she didn't die. she was the old lady telling the story in the beginning.|`|N7CjLgOmaa	nooo, shes the one telling the story, therefore she is alive|`|aOaffHMeaa	From what I read over the years there was never an exact reference. Most people believe that she died just like Jack/Leonardo said that she would...as an old lady warm in her bed.|`|O9MzZxyzaa	She died of boredom listening to herself talk.|`|wU6Mn4sBaa	No! But the guy does! She does die of old age!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Rose died at the end of old age|`|uVU5DDjmaa	Rose dies of old age at the end...<br>  <br>  X|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	I think she died.<br>  I cry every time.<br>  Damn.|`|TanepNjdaa	yes she dies old in her bed like leo said|`|k69XBHOBaa	no|`|tNoDAhbzaa	yes|`|gjRa5MS8aa	My Goodness There is no doubt Rose dies, Her life has gone full circle. ie. All the pics of her life around her, she returns the heart back to the ocean. all of the other main characters on titanic have passed, duh they were older than HER .  (common sense). Jack is waiting for her watching the clock, Her time has come. She does die warm in her bed an old lady.  Her soulmate knew all along. That is why she meets him first.  Her whole life she thought of him at night and maybe sometimes met him in her dreams. now is their time.   NO WONDER WE ALL CRY SO HARD AT THE END !|`|7HxLOp41aa	She survived but i dont know if she die yet.. probably she still alive.. she is very old, i say her on so documentary|`|ZllkJUkoaa	Yes, she's the old woman who dies in her sleep at the end.|`|BxSyq6ybaa	She does at the end in her bed, as an old lady and then reunites with Jack :-) Awww...

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The Blue Lagoon (1980)-- They weren't brother and sister, however--possibly cousins (according to IMDb). It stars a young Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.<br>  Here's the plot: Two young children are the sole survivors of a shipwreck in a time when sailing was the only way of travel. They are stranded on a tropical island, a real paradise. Together, Richard and Emmeline have to survive, which is quite easy as there are no dangerous animals on the island. Years later, the two teenagers are living in a self-constructed hut, strange emotions start influencing their relationship. Although they had no grown-ups to educate them for all that time, the behaviour of the two always stayed in a very civilized way. Nature takes its course, and Emmeline gets pregnant, totally unaware of the fact that a child is growing inside her. On the night their boy is born, Richard finds out about the origins of the drums they hear from time to time from the forbidden side of the island.|`|tuULGJS6aa	No movie has a brother and sister having a baby on an island, but "The Blue Lagoon" is one that has a boy and a girl on an island. I think Brooke Shields was the girl in it. A copy of it was "Paradise" starring Phoebe Cates. There was also "Return to Blue Lagoon" with Milla Jovovich.|`|UVnr7wrmaa	The movie is called Blue Lagoon. :)<br>  <br>  I've seen it a million times, lol. The brother and sister become stranded on an island together and begin to have feelings for each other. This then leads to sex, which then leads to the girl becoming pregnant....

e9gsf1GJaa	it depends on how much it makes.<br>  but how its looking now,<br>  itll probably be in for about 1 more monnth.<br>  I WANNA WATCH IT TOOO!<br>  it looks pretty :D|`|qRx3ynKdaa	For any film, the answer is the same, the film will be in theatres as long as the theatre owner believes the theatre will get more money by showing it than by showing another film.<br>  <br>  As most threatres are chains, if a threatre owner has five multiplex theatres in town, they may be showing it in every theatre on opening day, in only half of the threatres a month later, and in only one theatre a month after that. That's the way it goes with every film. Some films like those in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy appear in every theatre for months. Other films may lose theatres after the first week becase of poor attendance.<br>  <br>  This also differs from town to town. Films are not equally popular in different areas.<br>  <br>  Then there are second-run theatres, who run films at cheaper rate after their first run is finished, or at least mostly finished.<br>  <br>  In short, there is no answer to your question.<br>  <br>  A theatre may also drop a film, and then bring it back after a week or two, because it would at least, the manager believes, do better than what he is showing now, especially if it is the only threatre in town which is now showing that film.

You can do much more with an SLR so my choice would be the SLR digital camera every time even though I don't posess one as yet. The compact camera is ideal for people who just want to take snaps or for installing photo's on Ebay etc. but if you have a desired interest in photograhy then the SLR will produce better shots every time, especially if you understand the functions of an SLR and what is required for capturing the shot.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	I have a 5 or 6 year old digital that's fine for me.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I'd prefer a Samsung.|`|pTmUycXzaa	I like the ones you have to wind on yourself by turning the little handle.<br>  And those ones that post the picture out of the bottom as soon as you've taken the photo.|`|FomIa9jQaa	Samsung|`|G6JXHvZKaa	cannon|`|tDyRTmT8aa	i dont have one myself but the hubby likes olympus or canon.x.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Personally, I try very hard to switch off at the very mention of the world camera.<br>  <br>  Hubby dearest is a photographer, and there is only so many times a wife can look interested when someone describes every detail of every camera and it's capabilities, particularly after attending the recent "Focus" exhibition.  <br>  <br>  His would also be an SLR, (or DSLR he says if you want to be precise....zzzzzz!) sorry, fell asleep there.

DunP3Ruraa	i have 7 cats, and all of them are different sizes.  the smallest is probably around 3-4 pounds, and is naturally small, but my biggest cat, Peggy, is about 14 pounds, and is NOT fat.  she's just HUGE!!! one of the biggest cats ive ever seen, besides her brother, dudley (who lives with my grama) and he weighs about the same. maybe a little more.  they are both just naturally large and muscular.  my theory is that its because their mother didnt ween them until they were about 5 months old, and they were well taken care of as kittens.  they have two other brothers, lynx and tigger.  lynx is slightly larger than average cat size and very fit, and tigger is  also larger than average size but very fat.  i think it mostly depends on the individual cat.|`|Rwhqgpbxaa	We used to have one that weighed 20 pounds. She was really spoiled.|`|AA10231834	weighs 3 pounds.. it's only 4 months tho. tiny. compared to ur cat.|`|2g8m8USQaa	Mine weighs about 8 pounds.

<br>  The grime was no man's grime but death and human<br>      locomotives, <br>  all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad<br>      skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black <br>      mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance <br>      of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial-- <br>      modern--all that civilization spotting your <br>      crazy golden crown-- <br>  and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless<br>      eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the <br>      home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar <br>      bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards <br>      of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely <br>      tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what <br>      more could I name, the smoked ashes of some <br>      cock cigar, the ***** of wheelbarrows and the <br>      milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs <br>      & sphincters of dynamos--all these <br>  entangled in your mummied roots--and you there<br>      standing before me in the sunset, all your glory <br>      in your form! <br>  A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent<br>      lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye <br>      to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited <br>      grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden <br>      monthly breeze!

6qtuzvN1aa	I like meat. Dogs are allowed to be more forward in the fact that they like meat and they really go after it. <br>  <br>  Yes. <br>  <br>  But I wouldn't bite YOU if you were my vet. You're made of poison. And I sense that. Because I'm a dog and my senses are more powerful than a human.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	I bite the veterinarian anyway.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	No...<br>  <br>  It's the Dermatologists who should be bit...<br>  <br>  (I have no idea what that means, but it sounded profound to me right now because I'm drunk and high...|`|Mfi2lCxpaa	no i would not|`|Usx5zMNRaa	I'd bite the hand that feeds me and THEN the jerkface who brought me to the vet.|`|ftuE6Mfdaa	Only if he was covered in ketchup.|`|NLsaNo6taa	yes i would.... especially since my little sister is a veterinarian...|`|hHZ87qAsaa	I just wanna bite you<br>  <br>  ~Shae|`|025ff9e8b99f55ac4190c63b20155597aa	If he was going to fix me you bet I would.

I bite already, didn't know you had to be a dog.
6qtuzvN1aa	Sometimes I start a fight with my boyfriend just so I can get into "compulsive cleaning mode". Anger makes it soooo much easier. <br>  <br>  One day I'm going to start making a lot of money. I just have to. And then I will hire a cleaner. And then she will steal from me. And then I won't let her know that I know that she steals from me. And then I'll call immigration on her unless she gives me all her money. Because she will be an illegal alien. And then I will have lots and lots of money. But not real money. It'll be blue 50 dollar bills that she stole from my Monopoly game. And then I'll be able to play Monopoly again because I'll have the proper bank roll. It's a win win really.|`|oDGttkmLaa	I'm like you. I clean compulsively (jog too). BUT that's great b/c I have three kids who mess the house up at will. So my compulsion to clean gets overlooked as  me being a mom. One day I'll go to therapy and my house will be a disaster.|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	I don't really need a housekeeper, just someone to stick their head in the door, scowl at me, and go "Jesus, this place is a MESS!"|`|DzIlM76Xaa	You're like a violent, little scrubbing bubble of hate. My bathroom said mean things about your shoes. You should teach it a lesson.|`|NLsaNo6taa	yes... becuz i *really* suck at it.|`|DjifToZgaa	My housekeeper went to UCLA.<br>  <br>  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.|`|Usx5zMNRaa	Yes, I think the government should supply one per household.|`|AA11016425	Hell yea, I'm poor and I damn sure need one.|`|9S6x6xZ9aa	I predict within 20 years there will be androids / robots that can clean your house ( amongst other chores )<br>  <br>  Ever see the movie "Sleeper" with Woody Allen?

I hate cleaning.|`|R6pfYeioaa	In a nutshell, they should get off their carcases and clean up their own homes and after themselves.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, then I can sit even longer on Y/A and peer over the Monitor at her, chirping "You missed a spot right there" <br>  That'd be awesome!|`|M7W7lZBBaa	can I invite you over to my house and make you angry?

6qtuzvN1aa	One day Tublet, I'm going to have a wedding. And people are going to come and I'm going to look so perfect and it will be the most perfect day in all the land. <br>  <br>  My last wedding was at a courthouse. And I wore jeans.

You can hold everyone hostage and special agent snipers can shoot through the Jesus stained glass windows and hit your shoulder. Don't be sad because I'm almost positive there would be a Hello Kitty toaster with the gifts and you could have fun toast while you are in jail.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you have to wear an off-white dress, but something tells me you aren't very virginal.|`|dW9wcYiNaa	Get drunk and throw a wine glass at your mother in law.<br>  <br>  Release a bunch of rabid white doves that attack your guests.<br>  <br>  Slip poison into the reception food.<br>  <br>  Pump the church full of tear gas during the ceremony.<br>  <br>  Rape your wife's favorite bridesmaid.<br>  <br>  Throw a match on your wife's long wedding gown.|`|fA42bQHraa	Get naked, rub wedding cake all over yourself and start lighting things on fire.<br>  <br>  The naked cake thing is just for the fun of it, lighting things on fire is to get arrested.<br>  <br>  You'll get cool pictures out of it and people will talk about it forever.|`|xKpllrKnaa	Bring some heroin.

uqLUKbMbaa	How do you describe to one who has not seen one the beauty of a dew crested rose. Or a vivid rainbow after a spring shower.  How to explain that wonderful tingle up the spine and in the nape of the neck when your loved one smiles.  The warmth of her touch that relaxes me.  Not taking for granted, but knowing she is there when I awaken in the morning.  After many years, just about able to read each others minds.  Love is so many different things to so many different people.  The love between a husband and wife, brother and sister, good friends, etc'.  What a wonderful thought inspiring question.

Wheel and deal man. Tell you youll take that off their hands or fork over the money for a new ipod which is about 200 or something stick a nice warranty on there straight from apple over the phone, not in the store, and thats another 60 and you got an ipod which is going to last you at least 4 years. ive had my 60 gig for about 3 years so far.|`|mvIMPpSIaa	i delete the songs that have been on years and that i never listen to anymore :)<br>  but if you like them all then i'd say get a newer ipod with more space.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	i usually just delete songs cus i know for a fact that there are several songs on my mp3 that i don't listen to too much.|`|AA11431665	I Delete Songs I Don't Like anymore

3iB7bnJGaa	Obey your manager.<br>  You got permission to do something funny and mean.<br>  Now why would you pass that up???|`|KNflGltwaa	To be honest that Manager should be fired for such an unprofessional approach to a contest at work.  It would be more appropiate to something like that off of work time with his beer buddies.  I believe what if you do spike the food, this associate can sue the company if he gets really sick and has to go to the hospital.  On top of that, what if he is allergic to some type of food you spike the pudding with?  Than you will be responsible for something bad happening to him and you will be an accomplice.  IF I were you I wouldnt do it.  Let your manager be responsible for being such an unfair contestant.|`|T3wenJ8daa	ever heard of the scotch bonnet pepper. my choice for the manager.

However, if they're from the same city (or a nearby community), talk for months, and meet up in real life in a public location during the daytime, then maybe. I just know that I likely wouldn't date online, even if I were an adult.

I think Yahoo should just let people have phunn and stop trying to be a babysitter. Once the government starts getting involved in the internet, it will all go to $h1t, and people will have to get together some other way to have phunn, most likely through their cell phones.<br>  *<br>  How do you know it was an 11yo, maybe it was a cop wasting your tax money trying to bait people.|`|tmnCbCqcaa	If they can communicate in a respectful and intelligent manner, age is not an issue.

xnVTRGmyaa	I play Irish harp myself; mine is a 32-string harp built by an American company called Dusty Strings, which I taught myself to play because there were no other Irish harpers in my city. I didn't find it terribly difficult, because I was (and am) pretty devoted to the music, and I was pretty motivated to play. It is true that lever harp is simpler in technique than piano, violin or guitar, because it is tuned diatonically--the full chromatic range isn't available, and the harp is generally only in one key at a time. And, unlike violin, or uillean pipes, or clarinet, a harp sounds good immediately--you don't have to work up to producing a good sound from it.<br>  <br>  Any musical instrument is fragile; as for heavy, a lever harp isn't as heavy as you might think, because the sound chamber is hollow. My harp weighs 23 pounds and stands about four feet tall at its highest point.<br>  <br>  As long as the tuning pins are securely in place, a harp won't detune easily unless the temperature or humidity changes, like any instrument. You will get used to tuning each time you move the harp to another environment, such as from your house to your car to some other room; but an electronic tuner will significantly reduce the time you spend. They aren't expensive...be sure you get one!<br>  <br>  Harp string sets are made for the individual harp, because of the great variations in size and materials for each maker. Contact the harpmaker you choose for pricing on string sets, or for individual strings.<br>  <br>  As for nails--the standard teaching for lever harp is that you keep your nails short. Strings are played with the pad of your finger, the top corner of the fingertip; hand position is a bit like holding a glass of water, with the thumbs pointed up. Pinky fingers aren't used; they are too short and weak. That being said, after playing for 17 years, I recently decided that I want to play a wire-strung harp, which is played entirely with long nails, so I grew out the nails on my right hand, and am delighted with the sound; ornaments sound crisper and more precise, and I have just that little bit more reach. But as you are a beginning harper, I'd advise you to start with short nails for now.<br>  <br>  I looked at the Hobgoblin website (I gather that you're in the U.K.); and the immediate red flag that I see is that the Glenluce harp is Pakistani-made rosewood. I'd advise avoiding that one; many Pakistani-made harps are of poor quality, cheaply made and cheaply priced, but not very durable, and they don't make a good sound. Many experienced harpers recoil in horror at the mention of the Pakistani rosewood harps. The Hobgoblin models look to be a bit nicer than many I've seen, but please be cautious--a poor instrument will never produce a good sound, and will limit your progress.<br>  <br>  I'm a little more familiar with Stoney End harps, as they are made here in the U.S., although I've never personally played one, so I really can't vouch for them.<br>  <br>  If you'd like, you are welcome to drop me an e-mail; you can reach me through my Profile page.|`|UM9LlPWDaa	it is hard to learn to play, more like piano. They are heavy- never seen one dropped though so not sure on fragile. They detune as easily as other string instruments as far as I know. <br>  <br>  Not sure on string price.<br>  <br>  Not long nails because of the way you need to pluck the strings- however they can be a bit past the skin I believe.|`|8UZ74i0Saa	1) For a total beginner, it's "hard"; but since you already play both piano AND other stringed instruments, you have basic skills already achieved: I'm not saying it will be "easy", but not so hard.<br>  <br>  2 and 4) It depends on the manufacturer and model.<br>  <br>  3) See 2-4; also, harps are a bit more sensitive to temperature and humidity shifts than guitars etc, (more strings, and different structure), expecially with new strings.<br>  <br>  5) If you are going to learn the most common technique, you'll need to keep your nails shorts, or shape them so you can pluck the strings with the flesh of your fingertips if you need nails for other instrumens; it is possible to play by plucking the strings with the fingernails (some effects are achieved this way) but it won't give you the same "freedom", unless you're trained on purpose: many "traditional" harps are played with the fingernails (metal-strung irish, and I guess south-american).|`|iWH9IBbMaa	I think you will quickly out-grow such a small harp.  I have taught a quite a few people and if you stick with it long enough to really be able to play, you will need 36 strings.  The other thing about the Stoney End little harp is that the string spacing is quite tight.  Your hands get used to how far to reach for chords and intervals and you might as well learn from the beginning on a harp with a more traditional, wider spacing.  If you play piano and guitar you can easily learn celtic harp but you will be much more successful if you go to a teacher for a while to learn how to use your hands properly.  Sylvia Woods book and video "Teach Yourself to play Folk Harp"  is the classic most people use to get started.  You can get it on-line from harpcenter.com - a great source for harp stuff.  Any time you spend learning to play the harp will be well worth it.  It's a wonderful instrument.  You will love it!   Good luck!<br>  Harpdiva1

ZrzD487Xaa	It sucks to be me was such a good book!!<br>  <br>  right now I'm reading life as we knew it by susan beth pfeffer. You should definately read it!<br>  <br>  When Miranda first hears the warnings that a meteor is headed on a collision path with the moon, they just sound like an excuse for extra homework assignments. But her disbelief turns to fear in a split second as the entire world witnesses a lunar impact that knocks the moon closer in orbit, catastrophically altering the earth’s climate. <br>  <br>  Everything else in Miranda’s life fades away as supermarkets run out of food, gas goes up to more than ten dollars a gallon, and school is closed indefinitely. But what Miranda and her family don’t realize is that the worst is yet to come. <br>  <br>  Told in Miranda’s diary entries, this is a heart-pounding account of her struggle to hold on to the most important resource of all–hope–in an increasingly desperate and unfamiliar time.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	"My Friend Flicka" it's a story about a horse and a boy.|`|4vvELzRzaa	None :(|`|2diobki7aa	I'm reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.<br>  One of my faves.

0EaA6IACaa	depends on how many kids you're watching and what ages...i babysit two girls, one is 3 and the other is 5 and i get $7 an hour, but i also babysit 8 month old twins and they pay me $15 an hour|`|z0Ynd4zRaa	My babysitters charge $8 an hour, but I give them 10 because I like them. I think between 5-10 is good. Probably no more than 10 because we're in a recession. I think parents might be a little skiddish about having the kids come to your house. I trust my babysitter with my kids lives, but if I didn't know her that well, I wouldn't let my kids go over to her house. Just include on your poster:<br>  Name<br>  Phone number<br>  How much you charge<br>  Say how responsible you are, and if you've had experience with kids.<br>  Anything else you might want to add<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vDjg0srhaa	Well i would put on that your responsible HS student. <br>  You are willing to help kids with there homework (depending on how old they are) <br>  Your cell # ( I wouldn't put on ur address so creepos cant find ur house, unless u talk to them over the phone)<br>  How late you are willing to watch the kids for<br>  If you can drive (so maybe picking up younger kids up from school or daycare)<br>  <br>  Well i would charge 5 dollars an hour (then adjust the price for the amount of kids) And plus if you have to feed them I would raise the price too. k well hope that helps :)

7gH7sgi6aa	Both.  I am smart enough to know I would need an Attorney to protect myself and be sure I don't say anything incriminating or give out info that I shouldn't, even though I have nothing in my past to hide.  But I would be more than willing to help the police because they are all married and have families and I know all their wives.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	I'd be cooperative, and let them do their job!<br>  then call CSI, they'll get it rite!|`|HA8bxrLTaa	Hmmm, there's 2 people I'd suspect. 1.

7gH7sgi6aa	Yes.  It is their money not mine.  I would expect someone to follow my wishes after my death exactly as I have requested.

There are way too many evil teachers out there for my liking.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes, I had plenty of Satans, and a lot of his little helpers and a few wannabe Satans.|`|zVEHmTcHaa	Yess, my geometry teacher sophomore year in high school had hidden horns
7gH7sgi6aa	What a good point of just good manners you have brought up.  I've had complaints of this is my place of business and had it in my own home during parties (I let my two year old granddaughter slide, but run her in there to remind her to flush), and indeed one too many time in restaurants.  You know that if people do not flush outside the home chances are they don't always flush at home...disgusting!!!<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Most people are just too "lazy", that's why they've put auto flushers in many places!<br>  But only 16 percent of men wast their hands anyway!<br>  I raise the seat with my foot, flush with my foot, (and that takes practice), wash my hand (every time), and open the door with paper towels, then toss them back to the trash can! Never miss! I'm a better shot than "Shaq"!!LOL|`|aVq6lGUbaa	wow, how true that is, i get it here even in my own home, and it's always one of the grandkids who dosen't flush, it's a constant battle to remind them on a daily basis and unless i see who the last one was in there i don't know who it is that dosent flush.|`|FCmJFyPIaa	Being a trucker's wife I have found that there are alot of ill mannered people in this world.  We were at a truck stop just the other day and the showers were disgusting!!!!  The person on duty didn't even apologize and the manager acted as if he didn't care either.  Then we went to eat and there was trash on the floor and on tables in the dining area!!!!  Reported it in ,but no one has responded to any of my phone calls.  What has happened to cleanliness now days?
7gH7sgi6aa	Cry.  Once she's swallowed it it's pretty much over.  If she's swallowed it, she probably chewed it up and it's over.  What you get out in "the end" will be no proof but poop.  Maybe if there were cameras of you purchasing the winning ticket you could use that, other than that....it's all gone to poop.  You cannot get mad at the dog, shouldn't have left it where the dog could get to it!!!  Just be mad at yourself!!!<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Simple wait for it to travel through him and wait for it to be returned to me.

If you are no longer happy in your relationship and you're starting to look elsewhere, then it sounds like it is time to end it. It's not fair to your husband or yourself to do something like that. Cheating is never ok. Plus it could mean a very nasty divorce if you're not ending things on good terms.|`|OQ1fo0a0aa	answer all of these as a yes or no...<br>  <br>  1) are you blonde?<br>  2) are you seriously asking this question?<br>  <br>  if you said yes to both of these, then go ahead and cheat!<br>  <br>  if your smart enough and you know your husband wouldnt like it, dont cheat!<br>  <br>  <br>  DUH DUH DURRR!!!|`|cHF1PwRdaa	It is never ok to cheat on your Husband for any reason. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you should discuss it with your Husband before taking such a drastic step that you might regret later. Good Luck|`|SlgV051kaa	What? No.|`|BsK3u5p3aa	hell no. the psychic juss sayin that cuz SHE wants to fxck ur man. better watch out girl.

The psychic is not part of your marriage.|`|1Zbu0Z8vaa	no<br>  the psychic must really want sum haha|`|g08ELuNmaa	really no but tell your husband so he could do the same thing and if you found the right one you can divorce him|`|vzRwazI0aa	psychics are liars.<br>  don't do that to him.|`|SceQNNDbaa	Hell No.<br>  <br>  think about it.<br>  I SEE DIVORCE IN YOUR FUTURE.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	no, its not ok. if you want to be another man, divorce him first.|`|EBfBy4XRaa	Would it be ok to kill someone if the psychic said you could?<br>  <br>  <br>  Psychics are full of crap|`|MNDvP3rxaa	ask your husband, see what he thinks|`|0yVwW7CHaa	Its never ok to cheat on your husband|`|0gCEVaEfaa	wow... u went to some fake psychic... more like psycho!|`|26oL7vHoaa	PLEASE tell me your joking.|`|01vXGO1xaa	No skin off my bones.|`|9g7eeUmaaa	If that was the topic you had on the table with the psychic- then I would say that you were given the answer you wanted to hear. If you didn't want to cheat, you wouldn't have brought it up. Marriage is sacred.. and at one point in your life you loved your husband enough to promise loyalty to him FOREVER. Control your fleshly lust and avoid this person that makes you want to cheat. Don't humiliate your husband any more than you already have. <br>  Don't put the future of your life and marriage in the hands of a modern-day witch! Pray about it and make the right decision!|`|RhDu7N2Gaa	ummmmmmmmm no <br>  that is sooo stupiddd<br>  you'd have to live with guilt|`|Lw5lCNwzaa	No, not only is it incredibly wrong to do such a thing to the man you comitted to in front of God and your family and friends, but...a psychic? Hun, half of those people are frauds. And besides, even if the psychic said you could, that doesn't make it right, nor even plausible. This person doesn't know you, and if they do, they're probably trying to gain something from you by saying you can do this. <br>  You made a comittment, a promise to be true and faithful to your husband. If he isn't the man you love anymore, don't just go and sleep with someone else. Talk to him. If you have problems, discuss it. And if it just isn't working out, then unfortunately you should just go and file for a divorce. It's alot more fair on you AND especially him. Think about it.|`|t4MN8gcMaa	no...still not okay|`|PNdtSrgZaa	NO WAY!!!!!|`|UTmIU9JJaa	umm................... no its probably a test!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  think about it........|`|4Zj2Ljwlaa	well I would say no!<br>  <br>  but really you got married to be with one person only!<br>  <br>  if you want to be with someone else you shouldn't be influenced by a psychic to do so, that's weak-mindedness.<br>  <br>  sounds like you're looking for an excuse to do soemthing im---al|`|AA10909774	would you want ur husband to cheat on *you* if a psychic said so?|`|kk0UenaBaa	No (you moronic dipshit).|`|903jumnzaa	NO!!! you butt face!!!!!!!!!!!|`|red0o2araa	NO WAY!!<br>  i can't believe you even posted this!!<br>  come on! if you are thinking about cheating why get married you hoe!!|`|TwdzpfADaa	no cheating is immoral, wrong, and can only cause trouble.

I couldn't imagine someone I'm really close to dying..<br>  <br>  Also, about 6 months ago my great-uncle and his grandson died in a car crash. I didn't know them very well either.

2g8m8USQaa	My first car was a '78 Toyota. This was back in 1986. I had it for 6 months and wrecked it. I was 16. When I could finally drive again, I got an '86 Chevy. I drove that for years and eventually bought another Toyota. <br>  <br>  I bought my first new car completely on my own in 1994, when I bought my 1995 Saturn...brand new!

Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes -- I don't think eye color really makes a difference to me -- it's if the eyes have depth and show a caring, kind person they are sexy.  Only a man who is ugly inside would have ugly eyes.|`|V7z90Tz4aa	no way! the majority of the world's men have brown eyes <br>  <br>  -africans<br>  -asians<br>  -europeans<br>  -hispanics|`|yY3w8tfmaa	No natural eye colour is ugly on anyone :)|`|CU3v6N7zaa	absolutely not...|`|AA10106002	when they're crossed|`|bzwSCm6taa	no way

HSSuKNCUaa	It also depends on the rest of your birth chart :-)<br>  <br>  I'm a Taurus dating an Aries, and I have a lot of fire influence in my birth chart so that helps.<br>  <br>  Like it was said in above answer: remember, he is your boyfriend and he's coming home with you. I've found that that works like magic! When I get a small urge to get jealous, when he's really just enjoying flattering attention (with every intention of being happy to go home with me) - I find he only gets more crazy about me if I let him and then go home with him. Just let them have innocent fun, as long as it's innocent (you don't have to take actual crap, either). They like it when you trust them. It makes them feel manly and noble and good about themselves.|`|tBABYBiUaa	umm this could be tricky<br>  yes because cancer looks for protection ,and who just happens to be the toughest sign on the block ,Aries<br>  BUT<br>  Aries may be too impulsive and fiery for cancer,who is generally a lot more sweet natured.<br>  soooo it probaly won't work <br>  BUT<br>  you should also take into consideration rising and moon signs as this could make a LOT of difference.For example my sun and venus is in taurus so I should'nt really get on with aries,but my mars and mercury are in aries and my moon is in leo (which is another fire sign) so i tend to get on really well with aries and other fire signs.|`|XKLonJzMaa	Yes it can, as long as you both recognize each others differences, and being a cancer myself, I know this can be hard.<br>  <br>  To us, cheating is sharing an intimate moment with somebody else, whether it just be talking, laughing etc... if it's intimate, its cheating to us, and we get mad, and start playing mind games.<br>  <br>  Just let him do his own thing, and don't interfere. If he's out talking with 3 other girls, let him talk, he's YOUR boyfriend and will come home to you.<br>  <br>  And he's a fire sign, so ravage him in bed :p<br>  ( us cancers are the best at that btw  )|`|k9gp11PMaa	Yes, take it from me!

wA8Dyhq7aa	It depends.<br>  <br>  Usually album sales are the lowest source of income for an artist.  The biggest name artists only get $1 per album sold; most everyone else gets 75c - 80c per album sold.  (Yes, only 1/16th of that $16 you forked over for that CD went to the artist!)<br>  <br>  Artists can -- and do -- make a lot of money touring.  The best example of this would be the Grateful Dead .  They were the #1 money making draw in terms of tickets sold for nearly 20 years...in spite of the fact that their albums never sold all that well.  T-shirts and other licensed merchandise also helps in this department.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's the songwriting aspect.  You've probably never heard of John Hiatt (or heard one of his recordings), but he's not exactly hurting for money because of all the songs he's written that other people have recorded.<br>  <br>  As for the A-Rod comparison, $42 million isn't common, but by the same token, no rocker faces suspension for taking steroids! LOL|`|P0EicB8eaa	A lot would depend on their contracts with their labels and whether or not they write the songs and own the rights to the material and/or the master recordings.  For instance, if you're a rock star, but just sang a song with a band, you'd make a certain amount, likely, for each cd sold.  However, if you wrote the song, you'd get money for that on top of the performance, and if the song is marketed, for instance, placed in a film, etc., you'd get money from that.  Also, if you own the master recording, you'd get money for letting them use that for a film, commercial, tv show, video game, etc.<br>  <br>  Just working as a performer for a label, and not having written material, with sales like Metallica's have been, you'd probably have made several million from record sales.  Also, you'd probably make a few more from concert tours.<br>  <br>  Someone lesser know, in terms of being a star, could be making considerably more money by writing music then retaining certain rights and making marketing deals.|`|RvnBuOROaa	too much.<br>  <br>  i think  people should stop listening to bands that have tons like metallica, and start listening to bands that have none....<br>  <br>  <br>  theirs a death metal band im into, and their like the biggest in the deathmetal/ deathcore genres at the moment, and when theyr van broke, they couldnt pay it. they had no money.<br>  also, watch bloodhound gang's Evil Jared's episode of cribs.<br>  <br>  look at his house. not much, huh?<br>  a band as big as bloodhound gang doesnt have much?<br>  <br>  but really you have to put into consideration the cuts.<br>  major labels give about 10-15 percent of royalties.then theirs merch. then theirs money from shows. then theirs paying for a booking company, then paying for designers, then gas, then tour expenses, then band member cuts.|`|hlKEZAp6aa	depends. metallica are like the best in their genre but they are not exactly mainstream rock. basically the better the band are in their niche or the more mainstream a band is the richer they will be|`|tbQWWAxfaa	It depends on their record label, Cd Sales, Tour etc.

wA8Dyhq7aa	Only you can answer that question as to whether you'll be happy or not.  I'd suggest that before you invest the time and effort you study all you can about the music industry.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest you listen to the song "After the Thrill is Gone" by the Eagles (it's on "One of These Nights").  Whether you like the band or not, listen to this song, because it deals with EXACTLY what you're asking about:<br>  <br>  "What can you do when your dreams come true<br>  And it's not quite like you planned?"|`|L4f5ONEkaa	I still have so many dreams and goals and my plan is to complete them before I die.  I don't want to give up because someone or something tells me it will never happen.  That just makes me want to try harder to reach my goal/dream.  Even if it means blood, sweat and tears.  Since when you accomplish what you wanted to always do it will feel good no matter what.  I'm not going to let anyone get in the way of my sucess and thats what i live by.  Yeah my plans seem outragous but how did so many others complete theirs.<br>  <br>  Like I plan on doing something in the music field too and people said i wont make it and others said i will but that doesnt change anything.<br>  <br>  Even my other dream of being a psychologist and then a tattoo/piercing artist on the side to make extra cash.  Yeah people say thats wierd but I dont care.<br>  <br>  If my goals/dreams would change it wouldnt be because that I quit but that rather it doesnt appeal to me anymore.  I use to what to be a pediatrician but that dream changed because it wasnt anything I wanted to do anymore.<br>  <br>  Good luck it just takes hard work: ]<br>  xDont give upx|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	I'm sure lots of people have not realized their dreams. I don't think its for lack of talent or unluckiness. I think if you want something bad enough why shouldn't it be yours? If you work hard enough eventually you'll achieve your dream.|`|mBLZ59QIaa	Well what makes you so different than the famous musicians? You have two hands, can see, and hear well right????

X8ne9ytaaa	Ok, trust me, this is not an easy thing to do.<br>  Breaking into the music industry can be difficult and frustrating at times.<br>  Firstly, does she have any experience? This is really important as experience can lead to high recommendations for auditions and such. <br>  I know American Idol can cost money to audition, but it ends up being worth it, especially if you are discovered. It depends on what state you live in. Try ringing up various pubs, clubs, parties, school/local talent shows etc and ask for work there.. you might end up getting paid, and as soon as you get paid, you're technically a professional! Oh, and don't forget that many, many stars have become professional singers from busking, or as some know it, singing for money on the street. It might sound stupid, but it totally works.<br>  As performing in public to an audience, any audience, gets more frequent, your confidence is raised and so is your status and reputation! Also, you never know when there's a talent scout around.<br>  Join a website like StarNow.com, which can specify your talent and send you e-mails when there is a casting call or audition which suites you or your talent. You never know, I might hear of your sister one day (;<br>  Hope this helped..|`|fJichSMhaa	u don't have to pay money to go on american idol,but if your sister is really good she should participate in a lot of singing competitions or talent shows join a choir or something so that a lot of people can really see her talent and u never no, u might get lucky and someone famous can see u and be really impressed and sign you on a label or something that's what happened to rihanna, also if your not such a good singer u should really practice a lot and with time you'll have an amazing voice(joining a church choir can be good pactice to help improve your sister's voice)

He unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half, placing one half in front of his wife.He then carefully counted out the French fries, dividing them into two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them .. As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering. Obviously they were thinking, 'That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.'As the man began to eat his fries a young man came to the table and politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple. The old man said, they were just fine - they always shared everything. People closer to the table noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink. Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them. This time the old woman said 'No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything.'Finally, as the old man finished and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again came over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asked 'What is it you are waiting for?' She answered<br>  <br>  <br>  'THE TEETH.'|`|OugZL6mUaa	They are starting to bottle Chuck Norris' pee, they are calling it red bull.<br>  Chuck Norris CAN eat just one lay's potatoe chip.<br>  Chuck Norris can sneeze with his eyes open.<br>  soooo many more lol look at the website|`|gN56VYGDaa	chuck norris CAN believe its not butter.|`|Ng1yX5MXaa	Chuck Norris can swim through land|`|f8slY8wDaa	If God can walk on water, Chuck Norris can swim on land"/ Chuck norris is where babies come from/ Death had a near chuck norris experience/ if you have $5 and chuck norris has $5, Chuck norris has more money then you/ chuck norris can sneeze with his eyes open/ chuck norris can kill two stones with one bird/ Chuck norris's tears cure cancer, too bad  he never crys/They once made a Chuck Norris toilet paper, but it wouldn't take **** from anybody./Chuck Norris does not hunt because the word hunting infers the probability of failure.

cUjcn2lsaa	I am a massive, massive fan of fashion. I used to be a TC in Fashion and Accessories for a very long time until last November. I haven't bothered regaining the badge yet, lol.<br>  <br>  So, I have a subscription to Teen Vogue magazine and back in September I recieved 'Fashion Rocks' along with that month's issue.<br>  <br>  Yes, I saw the Chris Cornell Verizon Wireless advertisement, featured along with Gym Class Heroes and Bow Wow. I was like, WTF? Is he that desparate now? I can't believe he would do that.<br>  <br>  He also performed at the Fashion Rocks show as well as part of this Timbaland segment, along with the Pussycat Dolls and OneRepublic. I was just thinking, what is he doing, being on the same stage as PCD and Timbaland and the others? Chris owns ALL of them! Does he not realize that Timbaland is turning him into another Justin Timberlake?<br>  <br>  And there was also that Kurt Cobain article too.....plus, there was this article about Tokio Hotel and the writer considered them to be a 'grunge-inflected emo' rock band. I was like, Are you in your right mind??????? There's nothing grunge about them!|`|98GbovYTaa	beyond caring now..most people just aren't worth it<br>  its prob why i don't actually like nirvana anymore as well..alot of their 'fans' are just.. not the type of people they would have wanted|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I think Chris Cornell has been exploited.. but not terribly....yet. I mean I told people I was going to a Chris Cornell concert this passed November and many people were like "Who's that?" So all in all.. he hasn't become a well known sell out or anything like Gene Simmons or Ozzy Osbourne. Bring on the TDs, you can't tell me Ozzy didn't sell out.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Chris was amazing live. Can't scream quite like he used to though!<br>  <br>  And yes, I do hate that exploitation :(|`|V1hxvQukaa	wow. that's sad...<br>  <br>  kurt cobain diet? the man wore pounds of clothes so he wouldn't look so thin!<br>  <br>  anyway, i can't think of any examples, but i do know that it makes me mad when people wear band tshirts and don't listen to the band. even i have to feel pretty comfortable in my fanhood to buy a band tshirt.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  haha... it reminds me of the pair of converse that kurt wrote "endorsement" on. think he knew how true that was?|`|bWI43goqaa	happy friday to you too=)<br>  <br>  yeah that would piss me off about the Kurt thing too......<br>  and i hate JT lol ur not the only one<br>  <br>  but one Q, how do you know the kids dont listen to them?<br>  im pretty young, but not really young(ima teen lol an older one)<br>  and i listen to them, i actually only listen to rock and i HATE hip-hop rap,<br>  <br>  but i LOVE rock and rock genres.....<br>  im not trying to make you seem mean or anything man its just we shouldnt judge the people we dont now lol.<br>  <br>  and  that would also piss me off with stupid models showing off Nirvana T's. i hate wannabe little rocker kids, they are so fake!<br>  <br>  well, happy friday, and i hope everything went well at the doctors....<br>  happy friday!|`|Md0XccoPaa	I feel bad.<br>  I feel bad for Kurt. If he wanted to be some big fashion icon, he probably would have been one. Intentionally.<br>  <br>  I wear flannel because it's warm, and comfy. Not to make a fashion statement, not to be a little Kurt-fan girl. Because I've been wearing it since I was about 10.<br>  <br>  [Wait...Chris's face was left gumless?! What?! He deserves it. ><] <br>  <br>  My mom almost bought me the converse. Ugh. No thanks. Kinda disrespectful, eh?<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  I saw someone wearing a Nirvana hoody today, actually.<br>  So I striked up a Nirvana convo, and they weren't clicking into it.<br>  "What? It's ok to eat fish..WHAT?!" <br>  Turns out this chick was vegan. And me innocently quoting "Something In The Way" got me nearly *****-slapped.<br>  <br>  THEN!<br>  This girl was trying to talk to me about Nirvana.<br>  And she said her favorite song by Nirvana was "The Man Who Sold The World."<br>  I asked her who she thought it was by.<br>  "Nirvana, of course!!!"<br>  I'm in the wrong time period.<br>  Help me, Almighty Layne. ]:|`|qz9trhYhaa	Haha hardly anybody even knows who Strike Anywhere is.

Exploitation is just another service we offer, but I don't think that is exploitation. Are they taking advantage of them and viciously pocketing all the proceeds of said 'exploitation'?<br>  <br>  When you see an 'undesirable' in one of these listed shirts do you go up to them and ask them if they like that band or do you just ignorantly assume that they possibly couldn't listen to them based on how the person wearing the shirt looks?
ATQRFlCsaa	Yeahh there's been loads!<br>  For example DJ Ironiks stay with me was out underground for like 3 years before it was released mainstream. Grime artists like JME, Skepta, and Bashy only really got recognised in the mainstream music business because of them having underground hits years before, and im sure the same applies to artists of other genres.|`|5j0NgLDmaa	Yeah, happens to me a lot.

qswrz268aa	Yes... <br>  <br>  It requires vast technique, Including sharp and awkward left hand arpeggio figures, fast and strange tremolos, rapid repeated notes, and fast jumping chords. It also requires incredible sound control in some areas, and a lot of musicality to have the right proportions of eeriness and beauty. It sure is a beast of a piece.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say impossible for you to play, but certainly absurdly improbable. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to embark on the rigorous pilgrimage of learning this monster, I wish you luck. It is certainly a pilgrimage...<br>  <br>  Cheerio|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	It is considered one of the most difficult pieces in all piano repertoire.|`|gDxjINbQaa	I'm playing the Suite. Yes. It requires full use of the shoulders, arms, hands and fingers plus articulations of many kinds. It requires great use of the pedale at various depths. It requires agility and fluidity. <br>  <br>  Above all, it requires maturity. You can NOT obsess over every single note playing Scarbo. Nobody does. Or else you would never finish it.

But I always ask questions that people have no answer to. What I do is give simple-sounding, but unanswerable questions. People would think about the question and come back to me unable to answer the question.<br>  <br>  But yours has an answer (I think I've heard the question before), the measureable and known dimensionless parameters of the universe are calculable independently, since measuring things like light, sound, distance, are things that most people are taught to do before graduating high school. The only dimensionless "quantum mechanical accident" I can think of might be hardness. Diamonds are definately an accidental creation of nature, created by carbon atoms arranged in an isometric-hexoctahedral crystal lattice. However these "accidents" are also calculable.

tWzIsIH0aa	You can call your local Humane Society in your area. They have officers that will come out, look at the dog, and release it into the care of the Humane Society. They may want to ask you questions about the dog's previous owners. They won't arrest you. The dog does not have to be euthanized; it can be re-homed. Unfortunately with overcrowding, that may happen.<br>  <br>  Euthanize or not - it's just cruel to leave a dog chained to a tree, especially in frigid weather. The dog has already been abandoned, tortured even and such. Act and call the Humane Society.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Not all shelters euthanize. It's still better than being tied to a tree in the rain.

3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	Yes, Jonas Brothers are silly.  Yes, tickets for EVERYTHING are way overpriced.  It seems a little unfair to single out Jonas Brothers for not being classy enough to oppose ridiculous ticket prices when the rest of Hollywood is doing the same thing.  Having to pay $10-20 for ANY movie is ridiculous especially when the actors are getting paid multi-million dollar salaries.  But, you know...<br>  <br>  Hating 13 year old girls is a little harsh.  You only get to be that silly once, and why should they avoid it just because the rest of society hates the Jonas Brothers?  It's a heck of a lot better for 13 year olds to giggle and squeal at a boy band than for them to behave much older than they are (and get into trouble they're not ready for.).  <br>  <br>  I'm 30+ now but I went through my New Kids On the Block phase.  It was harmless, and eventually everybody gets older and most people's taste in music improves.<br>  <br>  So cut 'em some slack.  you're only young once.|`|By1DJAUOaa	IM 14 AND JONAS BRO R SO FRIGGIN GAY ALL THE WAY WEARIN SOME TIGHT AZZ SKINNY JEANS TIGHTER THAN MINE, YUCK AND HAIR LIKE FRIGGIN REPUNZAL!!!|`|JqhQSjQFaa	I SOO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING U SED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......and lumdog millionaire and coraline wer ,yes, very great movies|`|WbsDI2lSaa	sign me up!!!|`|C3Q8lfVXaa	Keep in mind, by charging double they're really only making half the audience of what films that charge regular price do.

Hi, I hate anything Jonas and Miley as well as you do and would love to have to dinner with you sometime (jk).|`|bjNgMocPaa	The Jonas Brothers are gay. Like, I think literally. Have you seen Kevin Jonas? He's like 20 and still a virgin. Or so he says.<br>  They suck at singing and they think every teen girl is in love with them.<br>  <br>  And did you see them at the Grammys?<br>  "Nick: Show me what you've got Stevieeee!" <br>  <br>  What a tool.|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	Well I am a teenage girl and I downright HATE the Jonas Brothers, any people who like them must have some mental disorder. They have to steal other peoples songs because they atleast know the songs they wrote are nothing but SH*T*!|`|kMDAjsBnaa	i love you...|`|FDv0GLmBaa	I'm a teenage girl and I couldn't care less about the Jonas Brothers - they're ugly and they make bad music and ruin classics (have you heard their cover of A-Ha's Take On me?). I love classic rock.|`|L5d1RtSeaa	Yes, Mr. Steriotype, the Jonas Brothers are annoying as freak, but that gives you no reason to diss 13-year-old girls; I just so happen to be one!! <br>  Anyway, I fully agree with you on the whole ticket thing and I think that the Jonas Brother's are WAY overrated. They are not the least bit attractive, don't have that great a voices, are show-offs, have bad hair, think they're all that, and charge 15 freaking dollars for tickets to take advantage of poor, pathetic, idiotic, stupid 13-year-old girls(that find no greater meaning in life thans seeing what's-his-name and his two brothers singing a carrol! <br>  Anyway, I am very relieved to hear someone diss the Jonas brothers! It's nice to know that there are other people who have kept their souls unsold!|`|Shi5z6iJaa	really ? you think this movie is when the Jonas bros. sold out? as if they had any artistic integrity before this? really? cause i always thought a band shaped from the bottom up by the disney corporation (like a certain other horrifying songstress) has sold out, been bought out and paid for. these guys were created like Hello Kitty just to sell crap and since the tastes of 13 yr. old girls are totally asinine they can charge whatever the market demands|`|xL6McXTfaa	If every thirteen year old girl in the US was obsessed with JB they would be FAR more succesful then they are,  I don't appreciate the generalization.  People like what they like and you need to deal.  I'm not obsessed with JB, in fact I find them laughable, but again, people like what they like and it has nothing to do with character.  And whatever your saying has nothing to do with the economy, the majority of teenaged girls pay for their OWN movie tickets.  Not wasteing their parents money,  and even if they were WHY IS THIS YOUR BUSSINESS!|`|xN29zstYaa	Ur totally right, their fans are brainless.  Why would you go see a 3-d film when you can go to a real concert anyway and a real artist.  They don't contribute to music history, to be considered an artist you should have originality (and talent). I do think its hilarious how some girls make fools of themselves by crying because they are within 500 feet of them. People should realize by now that almost all of the disney people who sing suck. Finally someone gets it ( :

UDAeKt7Eaa	Power metal isn't cheesy and Hammerfall is amazing. My favorite song by them is Destined for Glory.<br>  <br>  By the way, their album Crimson Thunder is not as good as Renegade.|`|UnsZKr4saa	Nope, Rhapsody (of Fire) holds that title, I believe.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Rq5D0nEYM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Rq5D0nE...</a><br>  <br>  I like Hammerfall, although I sometimes feel they lack diversity.  Their albums pretty much sound the same, although I haven't picked up their latest one yet.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	WHHHAAATT!! CHEESIEST POWER METAL? Nooo<br>  But your untitled to your own opinion i guess :P<br>  <br>  All there albums are  fantastical.<br>  This songs one of my favers.<br>  Secrets-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egZ41rTBdP4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egZ41rTBd...</a><br>  <br>  I love them too.But IMO they are not at all Cheesy<br>  <br>  There older albums are much more technical.I just got there new album from a secret place on the internets.<br>  *coughTORcoughRENTScough* <br>  <br>  No sacrifice,No victory comes out March 5 i believe.<br>  I've been listening to it and its not bad not as good as there OLD stuff obviously but none the less POWER METAL.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	I think they are abit cheesy..but they are fun.  I like Legacy of Kings the best...some good riffs on that album<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiQs7YjKZq0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiQs7YjKZ...</a><br>  <br>  of course lyrically its nothing to be desired, but its not like Bloodbath or Darkthrone have any meaningful lyrics|`|oOSNI3wbaa	ha yeah, they are a bit cheesy but i think thats kinda the point. doesnt matter though, they still kick ***.<br>  <br>  fav song: fury of the wild<br>  <br>  new album out in 09!<br>  <br>  btw: the "we're gonna make it" cover was originally by twisted sister. just FYI. ;p|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Of what I've heard of them i've liked their songs. One question, is "We're Gonna Make It" a cover cause I think I heard it before?|`|AgQForcYaa	Naaaaaaah, Hammerfall's not THAT bad... There are tons cheesier, like Rhapsody of Fire and DragonForce, as some fellow R&Pers have already said. NO! Power Quest and later Stratovarius take the CAKE when it comes to cheesiness!|`|dQvKvnVuaa	I happen to like Hammerfall. I would agree with the other answerer; Rhapsody(of fire) is the most cheesy of all.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Dude<br>  <br>  D-R-A-G-O-N-F-O-R-C-E<br>  <br>  As long as they exist no one else can hold the title of cheesiest, and I love Hammerfall.|`|kC3VwbfRaa	idk, most power metal=cheese to me.

I didn't need to know about the cucumber thing, but yeah, it's illegal to have sex with minors under 16 or whichever the age of consent is in each state.

ZhCJaXINaa	I dont know about the 4 girlfriends thing...in the 1st season Haley (Lucas's best friend) had a party, and Brooke (his ex), Peyton (his crush), and Nicki (his fling) were all there. I think thats as close to 4-girlfriends that Lucas has been. <br>  <br>  Season 1 - Lucas liked Peyton, Peyton rejected him. Brooke liked Lucas too, so he started dating her. Peyton then changed her mind and said she wanted to be with him, so he cheated on Brook with Peyton. Brooke found out, and they broke up. Lucas & Peyton started being whatever - then she found out about Nicki (at the party mentioned above). The season ended with Lucas, Peyton & Brooke all alone. <br>  <br>  Season 2 - Brooke dated Felix, and Lucas dated Anna (Felix's sister). He told Anna he was lying to himself, because he still wanted Brooke....so they broke up, which was fine with Anna, because she turned out to be a lesbian. The season ended with Lucas telling Brooke he wanted to be with her. <br>  <br>  Season 3- Brooke was scared of getting hurt by Lucas again, so she said they could date, but not be exclusive. She told him they should date other people, and set him up with Rachel, on accident....but then got mad when Lucas actually spent time with her (this may also be what you were talking about with the multiple girlfriends). Eventually Brooke and Lucas admitted they loved each other and were together. This was the season when they went to the cabin. The season ended with Peyton telling Brooke she had feelings for Lucas, and that she had kissed him - but Lucas/Brooke were still together.  <br>  <br>  Season 4 - Brooke broke up with Lucas because she was tired of being hurt, and he got with Peyton. The season ended with Peyton & Lucas together<br>  <br>  Season 5 - was a fast forward 4 year....and in that 4 years, Lucas had proposed to Peyton, and she said no....so he started dating his book editor Lindsey. They got engaged, and almost married. She said she couldnt, because he still loved Peyton. The season ended with a cliffhanger - Lucas called someone and asked them to get married - but we didnt know if it was Brooke, Lindsey or Peyton.<br>  <br>  Season 6 - we found out Lucas called Peyton....and now they are engaged and pregnant. <br>  <br>  <br>  WOW! Thats probably WAAAAAAAAY more than you wanted. Sorry. haha.|`|s6oLTFZsaa	first-lucas loved peyton but she didnt want him<br>  second-lucas dates brook but they break up because peyton falls in love with him and brook finds out<br>  third- lucas dates anna-felixes sister-shes bisexual<br>  fourth-lucas gets back with brooke but they break up again because of peyton<br>  fifth-lucas is with peyton-he proposes and she says no<br>  sixth-lucas is with linsey|`|vzjAhsJRaa	um..Lucas never had 4 girlfriends, you might have gotten confused. When they "went away for a while" I think you are talking about when they went to a friend Rachel's cabin and hung out there for the weekend.<br>  Brooke and Lucas broke up the first episode of the fourth season, because Peyton said she still had romantic feelings for Lucas. Since they are best friends and Lucas has cheated on Brooke before with Peyton, Brooke was scared that was going to happen again. She didn't want to get hurt she broke up with Lucas, and he started spending alot of time with Peyton and she eventually ended up telling Lucas she loved him, at first he didn't know what to say but they ended up together. Now in season 6 Brooke and Lucas are good friends.

Ow3O7h4caa	Sun / Neptune square is a difficult aspect to overcome. Its effects are particularly nebulous and usually becomes manifest as a liking for the mystic, occult, and illusionary but with a strong tendency to get lost along the path. More often, it represents a deceptive individual, one who presents the nost advantageous side of herself while hiding her true nature and motivations. It shows difficulty connecting with your "Center".<br>  NOTE: if you have a strong SATURN, it can be most helpful in balancing this configuration.<br>  <br>  I have often seen this aspect in people who suffer inferiority complex often due to early conditioning by your parents. Faith in yourself is seriously undermined. Your parents could have misunderstood you and probably could not see that you were asserting your own individuality.<br>  As you matured you continued to shield yourself against people who seemed to be trying to undermine you. You are creative, imaginative and eager to express this inner potential. But because of your rejection of reality, it is difficult to fond avenues for self-expression.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is define your ambition within the framework of probability. your sensitive nature doesn't allow you to cahallenge those who may compete with you for two reasons.<br>  First, you underestimate your ability to succeed and second, you don't want to feel responsible for hurting anyone. You need counsel to get over your hang-ups, to accept reality as it is and to assery yourself in the case of certain failure. Don't run from duty, you feel guilty because of what you don't do, but until you are willing to risk failure, you will never know success. Learn to love yourself or take a back seat to everyone else.<br>  <br>  With this aspect, you are especially vulnerable emotinoally and must extricate yourself from relationships with people who may try to use you. Be prepared to withdraw when you sense that others are trying to exploit you.<br>  <br>  Note that you should have posted the houses involved inthis aspect as this would give me a better indication, the area affected by this square.<br>  <br>  edit... Grim Pincer...!!! I have nothing to learn from you. Just read my posts and you will learn. Their are good books on how to read aspects. Give it a try and don't lose hope.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	it means that your dreams and ideals works against your identity. living in fantasy world would be exaggerating the things. i'd rather say, you are a bit too much of an idealist and maybe your expectation from yourself is too high, maybe unattainable. probably you can't stand the ordinary, maybe judging people just because they don't fit to your ideals, that kind of things.<br>  <br>  try to find a goal in your life where you can both express your creativity and integrate with the society. if it helps, think monkeys are people too.|`|0RBiVF20aa	It's not bad, it just means you're a dreamer. And other aspects in your natal chart may contradict some of the negative aspects of this leaving you more grounded. Plus, your natal chart isn't the end all be all of who you are. Ultimately, life presents you with situations and you have to choose how to handle them. Don't worry, we all have aspects of our charts that could be viewed as negative.

e44b5ee6cee3f3f6ca0a4ca6d4ecfba3aa	Alright, there we go. Internet was lagging out on me.<br>  <br>  You're a good guitar player, however on several of the songs you have a tendency to go flat, like on the 'Alison- Elvis Costello Acoustic Cover'.  I like your original songs, they're really good and I was impressed. I really don't like the backup part/your re-recorded voice in the background, it doesn't do too much for the song. <br>  <br>  Also, there are parts where it sounds like you're straining your voice to hit certain notes, so if you're finding it hard to hit them, try to take deeper breaths from your diaphragm more and you'll find it much easier. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, it all sounds really good - I like Runnin' Away.

ibiO4VEQaa	I think Locke temporarily stopped the time-shifts and not having everyone on the island sent Jin, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Sawyer into the 70's and they somehow joined DHARMA. Having five of the 6, Ben, and Locke back on the island will also slow the time-shifts downs, but it won't stop until the last 3 return to get the island to the 00's. Desmond, Aaron and Walt. I also think they'll bring some family members like Hurley's parents, Sawyer's daughter, Juliet's sister and nephew etc.<br>  <br>  I think they will all become the "2nd generation" of Others/DHARMA and stop the people from flight 316 from leaving the island like Ben did to the Losties in seasons 1-3.<br>  <br>  I also hear that the third episode to come reveals what Kate did with Aaron.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	in the preview for next week's episode, it looks like Sawyer & Juliet are on their own still. soooo, i dunno.<br>  maybe jin and faraday and miles only go to DHARMA.<br>  <br>  but i do know that in episode 11, we'll see what happened to Aaron.<br>  <br>  also this season, we'll see what actually happened with the Purge and who let all the chemical gas out of the Tempest and killed DHARMA.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Benjamin Linus let the gas out and then he became the leader of the others.|`|HEs6bzOtaa	i guess we will have to wait and see the next episode<br>  <br>  i cant wait<br>  <br>  LOST IS AWESOME

AA10368887	He helped bring about India's independence from Great Britain through peaceful resistance.<br>  <br>  I believe his comment about religion means that he was accepting of all religions, not just his own.|`|80II1Wv1aa	He was an Indian political and religious leader. He promoted resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience and protest. Gandhi was part of the civil rights movement in South Africa, had a role in the Bambatha Rebellion, and was the leader of the Indian Independence Movement. He ate meat some as a child, but through most of his life he was vegetarian. Gandhi was born a Hindu and practiced Hinduism all his life. Many Hindi love all religion and believe all religions to be equal. However, during Gandhi's time, there was turmoil btw the Hindi and Muslim ppl of India.|`|Lt4lR4jvaa	He was a Hindu revolutionary who used civil disobedience to help india gain independence from England. His name was spelt Gandhi, and he did say he was all the other religions, but it was his way of saying that all people are one. He also tried to unify India, although there was tension between Hindu's and Muslim's, and I beleive there still are problems in India. He was killed by assassination in 1948.|`|t5QTOBqzaa	He walked to a river and had a bath|`|SEzMrFrbaa	he was a hindu and a leader for india,he was vegetarian and he freed india from england domination.hes like william wallace for indians.but he was not a warrior.

kjMLQaHKaa	This is all based on your vocal range, which you can determine through playing a little scale on a keyboard. Before we start, remember that attempting to sing too far above or below your range, you increase the chance of damaging your voice permanently. With that in mind, get your piano or keyboard out, and play the lowest white key you can. Try to mimic the sound with your voice, and if you dont feel comfortable or if you have to growl to get the sound out, move up to the next white key (only use white keys for now). Find the lowest pitch, write it down, and start going upwards from there. Sing every note until you are starting to feel strain in your throat from going to high. Write that note down. From the first to the last note you've written down, this is your vocal range. <br>  Go to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_type and compare your findings to the ranges listed there (consider all ranges) and determine your voice type. Now you know how you should sing.<br>  In answer to your question, it should be something in your vocal range, whether it is low or high, it should be natural to you.<br>  Best of luck! :D|`|fJichSMhaa	i think u should sing a song with high notes,thats if your really good at it because it can wow someone when u sing this really good song that has high notes in it and u do and excellent job eg whitney houston -i have nothing, u should try practicing a  lot but don't strain your voice and u should ask someone who u knows sings well to help u practice and give u some advice

You can try to talk him that you need the privacy. Being your husband, I think he will understand.

Ow3O7h4caa	A bi-sextile aspect is usually formed when three points of a horoscope form a Grand Trine, and two of the points are in sextile to a fourth point.<br>  This will eventually fall under a kite formation when a planet opposes Pluto under progressions and transits.<br>  <br>  That transit then becomes the Focal Point and creates the timing to work out the stimulatin (often mental) outlet for the creative outpour of this configuration.<br>  Having said this, Pluto is the important factor here since Mars sets the tone, and Pluto will react to that tone. It indicates an individual who approaches life with much intensity, strength of focus and psychological stamina. You are naturally drawn towards investigating the complex undercurrents of life and can readily probe into subtle life matters with great depth and insight. You may feel driven to expose your inner workings to the surface for better or worse.<br>  This can make you one-tracked in your aims. You can have obsessions than can tax your emotional energies when not understood for that you are. <br>  <br>  Ona health level, when Pluto is transited by Mars or Saturn, it will play a primary role in medical problems. Or if Venus transits, it will affect the sugar metabolism, and often symbolic of diabetes or low blood sugar. Neptune, the body's resistance to disease, passing over Pluto is often indicative of the body's inability to develop animmune response .<br>  <br>  As for the Mars sextile Pluto, you are eager to know the truth, and motivated by the realization that truthis more powerful than fiction. Because you are aware of other people's motives, you are rarely caught with your defenses down. In personal contacts, you usually establish your position clearly so that no one has to guess your intentions. You have strong physical desires, though you won't accept a merely physical relationship. To be acceptable, the relationship must include compatibility in other areas.<br>  It may be necessary toyield occasionally to other people's opinions for they are valid just like yours. Do more than talk about your objectives. You must become actively engaged in pursuing them. You often talk as though you were involved in some activity when you have easily only talked about it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

I hope he chooses Melissa|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	My guess it that he picks Molly because he has a huge physical attraction to her but then he later regrets his decision and the big "Private meeting" they are doing is going to be him telling Melissa he picked the wrong girl. I think his marriage is a longs ways away if that happens.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	SPOILER ALERT!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure he picks Melissa.

qtsHy1edaa	God Hinata was one of my favorite characters, but to think she will survive where Kakashi didn't is foolish. Kishimoto-sensei is most likely going to end the manga soon. The middle point of the story is issue 245 so it make sense that the manga would end around 490.<br>  <br>  But to answer the question asked, hell yeah I would like to see Hinata alive and with naruto in the end but that isn't good storytelling thats called Fan-service or as they would call it Ecchi and Naruto isn't an ecchi series or Zabuza would of came back by now.|`|MyESqHb9aa	I really don't want her to die. When I came to the confession part, I thought it'd be one of my favorite chapters. But then a couple of pages later she might be dead. I'm happy she at least got to confess, so if she does end up dying, she would be more at peace than if she was thinking "I should have told him, I should have told him...". Hinata is my favorite character, and Naruhina is my favorite pairing, so I'm really hoping she pulls through. I guess for now all we can do is watch and wait.|`|fsYwrp0jaa	haha umm.. well i hope she does die XD<br>  yea im a horrible person but she has always been annoying and too shy and doesnt do anything.<br>  and it was just so funny how she 'died' instantly after her rant and i love you|`|ATKZ39Ceaa	i would be soooooo happy if she lives!!! she finally confesed her love for naruto.

I swear to god if ******* Masashi kishimoto kills her i will ******* kill him. I will fly to Tokyo all the way from the U.S. and knock on his door and murder him. But before I do that I'm gonna ask him what happens at the end of Naruto lol. He can't just kill her! She just got hit by pein's sword or something. It would be retarded if she dies. If she dies I'm gonna quit watching Naruto.I really am. She kinda looks like me only I have glasses and I have side bangs. I have a personality like her, but I'm not THAT shy. So if he kills her well bye bye naruto.|`|c8nRUYrcaa	OF COURSE I FREAKING WOULD!!!<br>  She's one of my fave characters... and she's exactly like me on the outside world.<br>  Besides, i really want Naruto and her to get together. <br>  :)<br>  Kawaii couple!|`|DPcIjHHZaa	i hope she live then Naruto and her can get together,(so many people have been dying i hope she not the next)

LBAh1tPoaa	Life ain't easy. Haven't you ever heard that before? Life is a series of choices and compromises, it will always be that way. Once you get older and have to support yourself or help support family it will be even more difficult. The way things are now, with so many people losing their jobs and failing to find new ones, I wouldn't quit and damage your resume.

ADX5N1etaa	Honestly, I could care less about the beats. I listen to hip hop because I think its artists are some of the most expressive, lyrical, charismatic musicians in the world. It takes a hell of a lot of talent to pile rhyme on top of rhyme while keeping time with a beat, not to mention making it sound good.<br>  <br>  I'm talking about hip hop, not the pop-rap that is blowing up the airwaves these days. REAL hip hop, like Biggie, Jedi Mind Tricks, Cunninlynguists, Blue Scholars, etc.<br>  <br>  That's why I tend to prefer East Coast hip hop. Its artists are just so much more lyrical than their West Coast counterparts (Tupac being the exception). I love the raw, gritty, urban feel of most underground rappers and the stories they convey.|`|5nwOZLgqaa	the instrumentals could listen to the beats all day|`|qDBeG26Saa	the beat is amazing<br>  its good|`|qM0XiOkXaa	beats 'n' lyrics<br>  It's a way of life.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	The beat, the lyrics, the celebrities: Kanye-West, Rihanna,  Ludacris, T.I, Chris Brown, Ne-yo, but sometimes I don't like the songs they come up with that are lame and stupid like: Woop RICO, AND Stanky Leg, Show off: To me those somes are quite LAME. But other than that I love it.|`|QvcJVoE2aa	well i like how it can be played to calm you down or party and chill, but i love the rhymes and beats|`|RwiodlHeaa	I really like the beat behind the songs. I also like how the rapper sometimed doesn;t convey a WHOLE story word for word, but you can understand the meaning they are portraying by just using words that rhyme. It's sort of like a puzzle listening to rap, because you really have to listen to get the message.|`|6e8fe8c64880cbb8e14bf3163f04dfb3aa	all haters shudnt be in the rap section. try the poetry section|`|AA10784709	wordplay the rhythms and the similes and metaphors|`|haxPqmIgaa	a**es taste like frosting. yummy damn i love you ohhh im HI!!!! jk jkjkjkjkjkjk.

AA10368887	I think celebrity gossip started out as a fun diversion for some people, years ago when gossip columns were buried in the back pages of newspapers and magazines. However, today, the media forces it upon us so often that many people have become brainwashed into believing its important. The media places the same importance on celebrity news as it does on actual news about world events, etc.<br>  <br>  Edit: The person above me is a perfect example of why celebrity news is harmful to society. For many it becomes an obsession and the ultimate result is a dumbed-down, uninformed population. Now you know why people barely know how their own government works, but can name every love interest for their favorite celeb.|`|H2qEN27daa	because people hate their boring lives and have no self esteem that they need to be "involved" in the lives of others, And they'll also feel at their best when celebrities get fat or do something to make them feel like they're on the same level as reg. people. its really stupid. who cares about their personal lives you know|`|d9mi76Jzaa	Why not? What do you do with all your spare time?  Perez Hilton is like God for me, I would die without him. I love knowing what kind of gossip is floating around...true or not true. It's fun and nothing more than that.|`|sF9vlOaiaa	Because our society is corrupted and all people care about is people that make a lot of money for doing nothing.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	because they have no lives and live through celebrities the octmom is a great example|`|GZ9LjS13aa	honestly, boredome

They just say that so that people will watch it Any way. just a marketing ploy|`|W2rr0quMaa	I don't think you missed anything -- nothing really happened.<br>  <br>  I have to say, my favorite part about the whole episode, was that after watching it, I was deleting it from my DVR and I read the "info" about this weeks program.  It said:  "The teams cook breakfast for some young football players and cheerleaders.  One of the teams runs out of eggs."<br>  <br>  Yep, that about sums it up!  I'm glad that Seth went home, but some more should get out of there, too - I think they only keep some of the annoying ones because they keep it from being totally dull.|`|t4MN8gcMaa	they always say that i was thinking the same thing, notice on the next week's commercials they said the same thing|`|AA12352550	I have not watched it yet!!!

0BthrqvAaa	The link below will give u a bunch of links for heroes episodes online. It's an OVGuide search result page - OVG works by simultaneously searching all the free movies/tv sites out there, so you don't have to go from site to site looking for the episode you want to watch.<br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy the show, it's one of my favorites. If you have a particular episode in mind, or season, just type that into the search box.|`|797085541186c24819b4827d65d67f25aa	Right here!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tvshack.net/tv/Heroes/" rel="nofollow">http://tvshack.net/tv/Heroes/</a><br>  <br>  =^_^=|`|v7Y9cFW8aa	Hi there, here are two good sites for watching Heroes online:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://watchheroesstreaming.com" rel="nofollow">http://watchheroesstreaming.com</a><br>  <a href="http://hulu.com/heroes" rel="nofollow">http://hulu.com/heroes</a><br>  <br>  WatchHeroesStreaming.com is probably the best site on the internet to watch this awesome show. They've got every episode online, and their links are always updated and working. There's also a nice community here where fans can discuss the show.<br>  <br>  Hulu.com is good, but they only offer a limited amount of episodes, and you've got to be a resident of the US to watch the videos. They are pretty good quality though.|`|aHCtcfr9aa	I personally LOVE hulu.  You can even have 'season passes' to your favorite shows.

It's a shorter series (only thirteen episodes) but it reminds me quite a bit of Sailor Moon, if a bit more romance. <3<br>  <br>  - Himeno Awayuki was a normal sixteen-year old girl until her father married a woman who happens to be rich. Since then, she has been perceived as an outcast by both her new stepsisters and her classmates. Later Himeno finds out from seven men called the Leafe Knights that she is something called Pretear, a girl who has the power to merge with and control the nature of the elemental-oriented powers from the Leafe Knights and stop an evil being called the Princess of Disaster.

xTioPxaVaa	A guitar amp is made up of 4 basic blocks:<br>  <br>  Preamp<br>  Tone Stack<br>  Power Amp<br>  Speakers<br>  <br>  Change any one, and it affects the tone of the amp.  Of all of these, the tone stack probably has the greatest effect on the sound.  Old Marshall Super Leads and Bass amps really only differed in the tone controls, yet the amps have completely different sounds.<br>  <br>  Also, the location of the tone stack in the circuit can change things up tremendously.  Soldano amps were one of the first high gain amps to put the tone controls after all of the preamp circuitry.  This allowed you to crank the bass up with totally mushing out the sound.<br>  <br>  In tube amps, the output transformer (which is technically part of the power amp) affects things quite a bit, as their is quite a bit of interaction between it and the power amp tubes.  (A solid state amp wouldn't have this).<br>  <br>  As boutique amp builder Howard Dumble once said "there are tens of thousands of valid guitar tones out there".<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|B3BrDzSyaa	The circuit design, and components chosen to implement it. There are several classes of amplifier circuitry, and endless variations on methods to alter the basic amplified circuit such as the equalizer, overdrive, effects, etc. Each of these can be designed in subtly different ways that change the overall end result - and the resultant "sound" of an amp. Differences also can be achieved through incorporation of tube technology in parts of the design, as well as digitizing and use of digital signal processors. Quality, depth, accuracy, monotonicity of components in this critical path, and method of converting signals from analog to digital and back again can all affect the results.

f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	Most actors will read the whole script first but not memorise it.  However some directors will not give them access to the whole script because they want spontaneity and some actors will not bother, or only read their own lines. <br>  <br>  They will then read and memorise their lines just before they film it.  Some will even take the script on set and read it immediately before filming starts.|`|LS6zgscQaa	You just memorize certain scenes and they shot those scene and move on to the next scene.|`|aYNoQvfMaa	Depends. I know of directors (Wong Kar-Wai, Jia Zhang-ke, Bela Tarr, etc...) who if they even write a script it's to get the film financed, and once on set they throw away the dialogue. The dialogue is completely improvised.<br>  <br>  Other directors want you to recite exactly what is written. Yasujiro Ozu was so obsessive about this he would even write in voice inflection. So, you literally had no choice in what you did, or said, or how you said it, it was already written.<br>  <br>  Generally you know the lines and action in your scene(s) and are allowed room to improvise dialogue (action is a bit different, though, because if you move to much you'll cost the film money because they'll have to set up more shots, to cover you're movements).<br>  <br>  As far T.V. goes I don't know, nor do I care. Garbage is the only thing that comes out of that thing.|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	when u are doing a part u must read the whole script in order to be that character<br>  but<br>  no u no need to memorize whole script as quite often it will change in spur of the Moment<br>  just need to know what scenes they are doing on what day

They also wrote songs for Chubby Checker and Jay And The Americans.<br>  <br>  Boyce and Hart wrote this as a protest to the Vietnam War.

NQKSDjz7aa	I love that part of the movie. It really goes against the viewers anticipations. I actually thought about him not pressing the button, though. It seemed like a good twist, and then it happened, and I was like "I told you." :)<br>  But, I don't think there is a name for that. Irony, maybe?|`|tiUkVOaKaa	Don't ponder too much on the movies. They're not canon. Try the comic book Batman; he's messed up in the head.|`|qtHFJFvQaa	I'm not sure the purpose of that scene was to leave the viewer "with the realization that all of the bad things that they imagined are a product of their own mind and didn't reflect the characters actual motives or actions"<br>  <br>  I figure that a writer/director (etc...) sometimes needs to make sure that their characters act as that character would be expected to act and other times they want to throw in a twist.<br>  <br>  An example of keeping in character that I've seen recently was on NipTuck. It seems in character for Chrsitian Troy to be struggling with how to handle Jenna wanting to enter her daughter in baby pagaents.<br>  IMO, if Christian was not struggling with this it would seem out of character for him.

A burst appendix is a serious condition that should be treated immediately.

HHSkwZKAaa	Freddie is and always will be the best.|`|1IWEKwznaa	At this point, no question, Freddie.

But Adam Lambert will make his own name. Beat that! :-)|`|45DyvK5Raa	freddie mercury all day!hands down|`|7JDuae2Laa	FREDDIE MERCURY IS THE BEST!!!|`|WtjsgMkLaa	Freddie Mercury is definitely the original, the best, so Adam Lambert doesn't really compare. However, Adam Lambert has made a name for himself on American Idol, and he sings with his own style, and I think he has alot of talent and he's a great performer. Freddie Mercury is still the best though, so it's a tough one :]

Opeth is still an AMAZING band, though. <br>  <br>  Favorite Gojira song:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gv7fo6mefo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gv7fo6me...</a><br>  <br>  Favorite Opeth song (in fact, this was the first song I heard from them and still love it):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5HVRy05QKc&feature=PlayList&p=4096FAF45EE6777C&playnext=1&index=34" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5HVRy05Q...</a><br>  <br>  Favorite Gojira album: From Mars to Sirius<br>  Favorite Opeth album: Ghost Reveries|`|kC3VwbfRaa	Opeth is my chill out preference, Gojira is for concentrating, but if pressed i go with Opeth, cuz 1. i prefer Meshuggah 2. there`s no prog i like better than Opeth.|`|4Nd1ycQiaa	Opeth is genius.|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	always opeth....come on, everyone knows nobody can compete against them.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	I like both, but I think Opeth is better. Opeth is just so simple that it sounds complex. I don't know how to describe it any other way because I don't quite understand it myself.<br>  <br>  MA2: Opeth - My Arms, Your Hearse <br>  Gojira - The Way of All Flesh <br>  MA3: Opeth - "In the Mist She Was Standing" or "When." Can't decide which.<br>  Gojira - "Vacuity"|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Gojira, bro. I love how technical they are. Joe Duplantier has awesome vocals (I think he does vocals, at least). <br>  <br>  MA2: Opeth: Ghost Reveries, Gojira: The Way Of all Flesh<br>  MA3: Opeth: Baying of The Hounds, Gojira: Adoration for None|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Opeth. Both are pretty good, but Gojira's vocals aren't the best (in my opinion, no offense to anyone that likes them).<br>  MQ: Opeth - Blackwater Park, Gojira - From Mars To Sirius<br>  MQ2: To Sirius by Gojira, Bleak by Opeth.|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	OpEtHHHHH|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Opeth has a better range for me. Damnation was proof that they could bring out a mellower album without selling it out.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	I love gojira.Never really got into Opeth(Sorry),I dont think i listened to the "right songs" so ill take note on some of yours.<br>  <br>  Gojira is more technical i love that, the guitar work in each album is fantastical.I really like From mars to sirus has some awsome riffs.<br>  The vocalist is pretty talented(no chalky :P)the guitarist pretty crazy <br>  and i have seen them live a couple times there FANTASTICAL.<br>  <br>  MQ:Gojira-From mars to sirus(also heard the way of flesh is awsome too)<br>  <br>  MQ2:Gojira ^^^ Backbone,Ocean planet,Unicorn,The whole album.
6EoAKcMwaa	I hope he is more famous for his music, but the sad truth is that he is more well known for that stupid show and those awful commercials where he sends his therapist a text message.<br>  <br>  BA: Iron Man, War Pigs, NIB, Paranoid...this could take a while. <br>  BA2: No More Tears, Goodbye to Romance, I Don't Wanna Change the World, Crazy Train<br>  BA3: Yes, and I thought they were all insane and stupid<br>  BA4: Occasionally. I don't watch very much TV at all. No shows in particular|`|fSYDOxX8aa	I'm not a fan of reality TV and have never watched his show, so it's definitely the music for me. I think he might actually be more famous for the show among the younger generation though.<br>  <br>  BA: Supernaut<br>  BA2: Aside from "Mr. Crowley", "Revelation (Mother Earth)"<br>  BA3: No.<br>  BA4: It's not on free to air in Australia.|`|x3vhAFMyaa	contact and reg is here<br>  <br>  I think he is most famous for being in the first ever Metal band<br>  <br>  bq- Paranoid<br>  bq- Over the Mountain (I'm listening to it right now)<br>  bq- no<br>  bq- MTV was only good in the 80s when they actually played music videos too bad i was born in '95|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I would think his music, but idk<br>  <br>  BA: Paranoid<br>  BA2: Shot in the Dark<br>  BA3: yeah<br>  BA4: No, I don't watch TV anymore at all|`|vvbhO88maa	The person dressed as him should have bit off a bat's head and spit it on Hannah Montana. <br>  <br>  His career with Black Sabbath for people that follow music.<br>  His reality show for people that follow reality trends or whatever is on tv.<br>  The bat head dude as for animal activists. <br>  <br>  Paranoid<br>  No, I used to watch the Sharon Osbourne Show.<br>  No|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I would say he's more famous for Black Sabbath than any thing, it was Black Sabbath that gave him his big break. It was also great on his own if not better in some ways.<br>  BQ: Iron Man<br>  BQ2:...Road To Nowhere<br>  BQ3:...Once when it first come on, and that was enough, I don't like any reality shows. And his sucked. I almost lost intrest in him, but his music kepted me hooked.<br>  BQ4: No don't like videos takes away from my imagination<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	for real music fans, he is famous for his career, for stupid posers, he is famous for his show....<br>  <br>  BQ:NIB/Paranoid/Iron Man/War Pigs/ too many<br>  BQ2: crazy train(excellent bass)/no more tears/I dont wanna stop/bark at the moon/too many<br>  BQ3: yes, but not that much....prefer him as a musician<br>  BQ5: no! MTV is crap!! its all fake/emo/pop culture!!|`|fY5mnuBbaa	I think he's more famous for his reality show.  He was infamous for the biting the head off the bat thing, but was just really another aging rocker.  After "The Osbornes" we all know now how lovable he is.  Not to mention his crazy family.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	I would hope it is because of his music carreer. I think he is a great singer, but I don't care for the show.<br>  BQ: Hole In The Sky or Children Of The Grave<br>  BQ2: Crazy Train or Flying High Again.<br>  BQ3: Once, I don't like reality shows though, not even his really.<br>  BQ4: No.|`|U0FgxEJxaa	I think that Ozzy is more famous because of his music career, but may have gained more fans because of the reality show.  I didn't watch it religiously, but I did see quite a few episodes.|`|5292c54ca6f10000abfcca621a4f8806aa	He was already famous for his career but his show 'boost' him up. So ?I guess alot of people are walking around like they know him for real now lol.<br>  <br>  BQ3: Like one episode|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Most people are gunna remember him from the tv show,not everyone is a heavy metal freak.|`|AA11430900	Well, that would depend upon who you ask.. you ask a teenager who culls their mind on MTV they will obviously say the television show as they probably have little exposure to his music.<br>  <br>  Now, you ask a 40 year old like myself, who has seen Ozzy in concert a dozen times, you know what that answer will be.<br>  <br>  BQ - Children of the Grave<br>  BQ2 - Flying High Again<br>  BQ3 - Hell no<br>  BQ4 - I haven't watched MTV since they stopped being an actual music channel.. I don't need another crappy tv channel..there are too many of those already.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	i think Ozzy is more known for what he did on stage at concerts then what he did on his show..and his music...i mean it's hard not to pay attention to some who bit the head of a bat..<br>  <br>  BA: i heard one in the car and really liked it but forgot the name so i'll just say Paranoid<br>  BA2: Junkie is great and i really like Shot In The Dark<br>  BA3: nope...i dont like reality tv<br>  BA4: i don't like MTV...because the don't play any music on it..it should be called RTV..reality tv..what happen to the music?|`|k7jGZydJaa	Why were you watching Hannah Montana??<br>  <br>  Anyway, I didn't even know he was a musician for a while (I blame my parents for never educating me about music). I just knew his name and knew had a TV show.<br>  <br>  edit: ohhkay then. My friends watch that show. I know Elvis has been mentioned and also Coldplay.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	For that show unfortunately<br>  BQ: N.I.B or Children of the Grave,paranoid and iron man are the most overrated cliche Sabbath songs of all time.Iron Man's still pretty awesome though.<br>  BQ2: Since everyone going to say "Crazy Train" I'll go out on a limb and say "Mr.Crowley".<br>  B3: No<br>  B4 - I don't watch MTV at all.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	I would hope it's because of his long music career. But it's hard telling.<br>  <br>  1. Heaven and Hell<br>  <br>  2. No More Tears<br>  <br>  3. I saw a few episodes<br>  <br>  4. I hate MTV. Unless it's one of the others, like MTV2, which replay good music from time to time, and old episodes of Headbangers Ball.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	Black Sabbath for sure, maybe if you are younger you might now him from the osbournes but I would say anyone late teens and up would no him for Black Sabbath and his solo career.<br>  <br>  BQ: Paranoid<br>  BQ2:Crazy Train<br>  BQ3: Yes<br>  BQ4: Not anymore|`|dFacbjIZaa	Probably the show, and that disgusts Me with American culture beyond words. So plastic, shallow, and superficial...gahhhhhhh.<br>  <br>  BA: Megalomania<br>  BA2: Suicide Solution<br>  BA3: No, I despise MTV<br>  BA4: I did back when it didn't blow goats.|`|PUQLJqb4aa	unfortunatley, hes famous cause of the show but we metal heads know why he should be famous, hell yeah!!!!<br>  <br>  questions:<br>  <br>  1. War Pigs<br>  2. Mr Crowley<br>  3. Maybe a couple minutes hear and there<br>  4, No, its sh*t|`|eTMfP8CMaa	i did not even know he had a show so i guess music<br>  <br>  BQ: The Wizard<br>  BQ2: Crazy Train<br>  BQ3: No<br>  BQ4: Jackass or Rob & Big none of that making the band but its actaully a rap group bull shits|`|Ml22a6evaa	I remember him in Back Sabbath back in the day,I think he sold out.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Do not watch Hannah Montana - it will rot your brain.  And all us R&P Metal Heads will come after you!!  lol<br>  <br>  I think it's for Black Sabbath and his solo career.  I refuse to believe otherwise!<br>  <br>  BQ:    War Pigs<br>  BQ2:  Gets Me Through<br>  BQ3:  Couple of times<br>  BQ4:  No.  Not since the good old days when it really was Music Television!!  What a concept.|`|N62uLMf3aa	i hope for his career, I never watched his show.<br>  <br>  BQ: The Wizard<br>  BQ2: Bark at the Moon<br>  BQ3: iie<br>  BQ4: no i don't watch rtv.

dMETGnPlaa	Any one you choose; But I've answered my own question as to where I can find Abby Sciuto in all of her outfits worn by her from head to toe, and that would be to go through every episode; you too can do this at:<br>  <a href="http://www.yidio.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yidio.com/</a> , and you also don't have to download, and they have seasons 1 episode 1 through season 6 episode 17!! I just get the pictures by taking a sceenshot by clicking on alt and then the prtScn button which is to the right of the F12 button, and putting it into the paint format, pasting it, mapping out how much of the picture I want, coping it, going to file and selecting new, and when it asks if you want to save I click on no, and then pasting the selection again, and filing it. Pretty cool, no?|`|jYaNony6aa	The episode where Kate died is my favourite episode but very tragic. What site do you use? I have one like that only SVU oriented.

VILBKcZMaa	Give him comic books like DC Comics ( Batman, Superman, Justice League, Green Lantern, Teen Titans, and even Catwoman) or you can give him Marvel Comics ( X-Men, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, Dare Devil, The Punisher, Blade, Elektra, and even the Avengers). Which seems approrpiate for him.|`|soUND2xEaa	SPIDER MAN! BEST HERO ALIVE or maybe The book on martin luther king(he is a hero.........) or hulk<br>  <br>  x-men comics might work since they have alot of hereoes in it.|`|9RqmSgFKaa	X men - wolverine, gambit.|`|xPeIvywdaa	xmen wolverine|`|6g3Z8NwVaa	How old is your little brother?<br>  <br>  I read DC books and right now may not be the time to get him into Batman. It's hard enough for an adult to make sense of it at times. And right now the Batman titles are on hiatus for a big Batman event which would've required your brother catch up with the last 2 years of Batman. Plus they're very violent right now. It's a misconception that comics are for kids. Most readers are adults.<br>  <br>  DC does have kid books like Tiny Titans and Supergirl. You can check out their DC Kids line. <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/dckids/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dccomics.com/dckids/</a>|`|Alkp8P29aa	I used to like Superman, sorta!

QxD82Nciaa	Record your voice. Sometimes you can cringe after hearing yourself & wonder 'who was i kidding!' Also maybe post it on youtube get the public to give their opinion. You don't neccesarily have to have your face in the video if your shy but atleast you'l get to know the truth without embarassing yourself! The way i look at it.. those people who go on american idol etc. all think they're good but clearly are not! so you need objective criticisms to know whether your good or not. Its a good sign that you recognise that friends/or family might say that your good to spare your feelings. So your not living in fantasy land.. good on you!|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Take singing lessons - you'll soon find out how good you are - a teacher won't kid you thats for sure!|`|Mb7PP53Xaa	I recommend listening to a song you know well through headphones whilst taping yourself, sing along then when the song finishes play it back and you'll soon know. hope this helps x|`|70At0HClaa	do you empty a room when you sing or do they put there fingers in there ears if no to these questions u can probably sing, go for singing lessons they will tell you yes or no.|`|DhTtm3ayaa	Sing around people and see what they comment.|`|hB3KPcd5aa	Sing in front of people u trust 2 really get thier opinon.Sing when YOU r ready 2 sing.Or just get singing lessons.|`|5QsCtMCqaa	Well, what i would do(because i dnt kno if im a good singer either)<br>  i would maybe go to a music teacher(choir teacher) and ask if they have time and sing for them.They have had expirence and maybe they can fix whats wrong if there is anything wrong...But im sure that they will help...and for your shyness problem because im shy too...you should practice singing in front of your friends and family even if they think that you are a good singer or not but im sure they wil help you reach your goal because that is what family and friends are for...|`|45DyvK5Raa	see what reactions you get but if you cant sing dont bother taking lessons its kind of a you either got it or dont.

I hope he read these, there are so many people who love you Michael!|`|wf3S2avqaa	Ive been to the Neverland Valley Ranch before but when Mike came out to many people started acting crazy and pulling on him so he went back in the house.

3hYUNHphaa	he changed his stage name to just zane, and he came out with an album a year ago, which not many people went out and bought. he's pretty "washed up" at the moment, but he's working on a new movie that should come out soon. he was a cutie ;D|`|74d5h8Ueaa	I wouldn't say washed up but I think he got saved because when he played on fighting temptation, he had a christian rap song so............., but if you listen to tupac, a lot of lil zane sounds similar, either he was a ghost writer for tupac or he just idolized tupac, im curious though
39323f708ae4eeca665692a228eaaf08aa	Well i don't really remember what happened in last weeks episode but in last night's we find out that Amy is keeping the baby! Alllll her "friends" come over and Grace tells her that she can have a job at the church where there is a daycare and she can keep her baby there during the school day and then work there after school to pay back for the service she used. more happened but i'm not exactly sure what it was.<br>  <br>  (the two most recent episodes are at the bottom of the list)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/the-secret-life-of-the-american-teenager/show/75441/episode.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/the-secret-life-of-the...</a>|`|uEF1FiySaa	<a href="http://www.ch131.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ch131.com/</a> has all of the eps.
fKcr6KU0aa	Pretty anime, huh?<br>  <br>  Clannad and Kanon are by the same company as Air, so you'd probably like them, too.<br>  <br>  I think the artwork in Honey and Clover is beautiful.  So is Bokura ga Ita, and parts of Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances).  Maria-sama ga Miteru (Maria Watches Over Us) and Haibane Renmei are also pretty...all muted pastels.  So is Victorian Romance Emma.<br>  <br>  Also seconding Fruits Basket and Ouran High School Host Club, and adding Revolutionary Girl Utena and Princess Tutu (...kind of) as anime with similar artwork.<br>  <br>  Cardcaptor Sakura is just *adorable*, in every way.  Almost anything by CLAMP is pretty, actually - especially xxxHolic and Tsubasa and Chobits, IMHO.  <br>  <br>  Ichigo Mashimaro (Strawberry Marshmallow) and Pita Ten are both pretty cute.<br>  <br>  Please Save My Earth is beautiful, especially the ending sequence.<br>  <br>  I have to mention the Miyazaki/Ghibli movies...they're very detailed.<br>  <br>  Oooh, seconding Gankutsuou, it's really psychedelic.  <br>  <br>  ...I can't think of any more.  YMMV.|`|BF7CCozHaa	Deathnote!! that is my favortive evur <3 L!!!! and Vampire Knight!! (2nd fav!!)& D.N. angel & chobits & bleach & fruits basket &inuyasha & samurai champloo & one piece (bleh to me) & chibi vampire & marmalade boy & naruto (duh) & card captor & sailor moon (that's a really old one but its a classic most everyone knows about it but just in case) & ninja nonsense  ya know im gonna stop myself n4 i write a whole encyclopedia about anime! ^-^' (might continue on into good manga too lol)|`|YSIem55Maa	Don't forget One Piece. The art style is very...unique. It's not bad in any way, but it's definitely different than normal anime style. There are some really nice looking parts though, so this might interest you.|`|o2sOX7azaa	Try Code Geass, Clannad, Clannad After Story, or Wolf's Rain. All of them have good graphics.|`|eR8uVnQcaa	dot hack sign|`|ivqfhzHXaa	try fruits basket, skip beat, the wallflower, la corda d'oro, kaleido star, and ouran high school host club...<br>  all these animes are pretty cute|`|uctxzjIIaa	Moribito<br>  Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex|`|P9wB5Epdaa	I would recommend Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo.<br>  <br>  It has one of the most beautiful art I've ever seen, a story that will grip you right off the start and a great soundtrack.<br>  <br>  Full review:<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankuts...</a>|`|KSC02NcLaa	Bounen no Xamdou : <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5842" rel="nofollow">http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?sho...</a>|`|4qVWj3UHaa	deathnote, fuLLmetaL aLchemist, code-geass, claymore, gantz, souLeater.|`|OIGsW7lMaa	try bleach naruto death note and many more check out my site i just started i have more you can pick from  <a href="http://godub.webs.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://godub.webs.com/index.htm</a>

The three of those are extremely scary, so it's a good thing you'll have your bf to cuddle up to if you get too scared, RAWR!|`|z0HUkNt7aa	Any zombie movie should be pretty cool. Not that scary usually but still fun to watch! Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, 28 days later, 28 weeks later, Shaun of the Dead ...<br>  <br>  For horror, you could try ... High Tension (I think ... something like this, if you have comcast its free on demand), P4, The Exorcist, White Noise (not very scary). If you do have comcast, just browse their horror flick section on free On Demand and I am sure you can find something =P|`|GYij4N13aa	The Exorcist, the SAW Series, or Vacancy..Vacancy's not really as scary, but it will surely give you the chills.|`|N6t1q65xaa	how about Silent Hill, The Blair Witch Project or The Eye (US Version)|`|2OPaqkLcaa	John Carpenters "The Thing"|`|AA12113085	Best horror flick of all time is the original Friday the 13th.

12QJ9QMRaa	surprisingly, I actually like them.<br>  <br>  LAst year when they started playing "Scars" on the radio I had no idea who they were..but thought the song was pretty good.<br>  <br>  When I found out it was the singer from Slipknot, I did a double take..... cuz he actually sounded GOOD with Stonesour.<br>  <br>  So, i will say, while they will never replace Iron MAiden.... I like them.  They are 10x better thna Slipknot.<br>  <br>  No gimmicks, less ego, and less annoying fan BS mixed with better music = WIN in  my book.<br>  <br>  and since when does adding a disck jockey and banging on garbage can lids make a band innovative?  SOme folks need to get out more.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Meh. I liked their singles, Through Glass, 30/30-150 & Bother but I never bought an album cause I know well i'd be disappointed with the other tracks.<br>  <br>  As for being better than Slipknot I don't agree with that but it's all a matter of taste.|`|lVxhiMopaa	" I'm looking at you through the glass, Don't know how much time has passed, but God it feels like forever. "<br>  (I like that song )<br>  <br>  Indeed yes, way better then Slipknot :]|`|cUjcn2lsaa	They're not that bad......definitely a million times better than Slipknot......I used to be OBSESSED with 'Through the Glass'...I still like that song.|`|hlKEZAp6aa	stone sour are an awesome band. my favourite song is 30/30 150<br>  ′′they called us a dead generation, they told us that we wouldnt survive, they left us alone in the mallstrom, as you can see were all clearly alive, we know where we are were coming, lets see you say that sh1t to our face, 30/30 150 remembers, 30/30 150 HATES!′′<br>  <br>  i love corey taylors lyrics as they are always complex and have meaning as well as kicking a55 <br>  <br>  however i am a massive slipknot fan and i have to say i think slipknot are better, but thats because i like heavy metal more than the not as heavy stone sour. Still one of the best bands around though.<br>  <br>  if you like corey taylors vocals listen to ``im not jesus`` by apocalyptica, he does guest vocals for them on that track.<br>  <br>  what i dont understand is why people are posting opinions on stone sour being either better or worse than slipknot as they are totally different bands. my opinion is slipknot are way better because i prefer their style, and stone sour are not exactly mainstream so i wouldnt say it was corey′s sell out project. <br>  <br>  nobodies mentioned that jim root plays for both bands aswell as corey. just thought id mention it for those who didnt know. <br>  <br>  anyway you should to listen to slipknots all hope is gone and subliminal verses albums as they are ******* awesome, and more of stone sour before making a proper judgement.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	i was shocked when i found out Corey Taylor was the singer...i like them way better then Slipknot too...i got their Come What(ever) May CD...favorite songs are Silly World, Your God, 30/30- 150, Come What(ever) May...not a fan of Through Glass though...i recommend you to check them out more because they are a good band.|`|RvnBuOROaa	slipknot is innovative and creative, while stone sour is just formulative mainstream rock.<br>  <br>  slipknot is way  better.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	This is ironic since I've been listening to Through the Glass every chance I get today hah.<br>  I don't think they can really be compared to Slipknot. They sound too different to me. <br>  But I do love them :]|`|RKMWeMk9aa	I dig Stone Sour, Brother and Inhale are awesome tracks. I wish both Corey Taylor and James Root would focus more on that band than Slipknot.|`|tThzNEYfaa	Corey Taylor's sellout project|`|eoVRS0Y8aa	WAY BETTER THAN SLIPKNOT!!|`|HQPwwntfaa	They're alright..but Slipknot is better.|`|lnmlNxJhaa	i definitely prefer Corey in Stone Sour as opposed to Slipknot.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I like the songs I have heard from them and, yes, I would agree they are better than Slipknot!|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Not a big fan and I haven't heard mych by them, but they are way better than Slipknot.

YrG61nw2aa	by the way this is really stupid but..<br>  <br>  OK, you asked for it. Here it goes:<br>  <br>  Once upon a time, in the purple kingdom of Purpalon, there lived a purple king. One purple day this purple King, who was purply named Purple Purple the fifth, called his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, over to his purple side.<br>  <br>  "My purple son," the purple king said to purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, "in another purple kingdom a very short purple distance away there lives another purple king. This purple king has a purple princess that I think that you should marry. Here she is, the purple Princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia."<br>  <br>  Purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, upon seeing the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, agreed to marry her. And so, one fine purple day, in the purple garden, Prince Purple Purple the sixth and stood by the purple altar and watched his purple bride-to-be, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, march down the purple aisle wearing a purple wedding dress and carrying a bouquet of purple flowers. Just as the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia reached the purple altar, however, an evil purple magician appeared and cast a purple spell on the purple princess. In a purply moment, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia had vanished.<br>  <br>  "What have you done?" cried the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.<br>  <br>  "I have sent the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia to a purple cave in the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in her purple cave, she is guarded by the purple dragon Purplefang. The purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia is purply safe there, but the purple dragon Purplefang, will not let her rejoin the purple kingdoms of Purpalon and Purplonia."<br>  <br>  "You are purply insane," the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth said to the Purple magician, but the purple magician had vanished.<br>  <br>  "What are you going to do, my purple son?" the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon asked his son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.<br>  <br>  "I am going to take my purple horse, Purple Lightning, and my purple sword, Purple Death, and go slay the purple dragon Purplefang and rescue the fair purple maiden the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia."<br>  <br>  "May the purple God speed you well on your purple journey," the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon purply blessed his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth. With that, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth got his purple sword, Purple Death, and his purple horse, Purple Lightning, and rode off to the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.<br>  <br>  The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, rode his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the purple horse Purple Lightning got tired, so the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth carried his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.<br>  <br>  Finally, the Purple prince Purple Purple the sixth reached the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in a purple cave on top of the purple mountain, Prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon could see the purple smoke from the purple dragon Purplefang who lived in the purple cave in which the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia was a purple prisoner. Our purple hero, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, climbed the purple mountain Mount Purpletop and slew the purple dragon Purplefang as the purple beast slept purply. The purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon rescued the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. But their purple adventures were not yet come to their purple close. They still had to get home purple and sound.|`|4Pzfqxqiaa	This just-married Chinese coupled decide to make love on their wedding night in the hotel where they held their wedding. The wife did not want to get pregnant and requested the husband to buy condom from the shop nearby. When the husband went out, the wife waited anxiously in the room with all the lights switched off...<br>  <br>  While the husband was out, an Indian thief came into the room. The wife did not notice and thought that it was her husband. She grabbed the Indian and happily screwed away. The wife was so exhausted that she fell asleep immediately.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, the husband had a hard time looking for a shop that sold condoms and when he finally found one, he realized that he had only one 20-sen coin. He asked the shop owner to sell him one piece of condom and the shop owner asked him which quality that he wanted.<br>  <br>  "The white condom, lowest quality, is 15 sen each. The black condom, average quality, is 20 sen each. And purple condom, the highest quality, is 25 sen each". So, the husband chose the black condom as he had only 20 sen with him.<br>  <br>  When he reached the hotel, he found his wife sleeping. Without a warning, he jumped onto his wife and started making love. The wife was surprised that the husband was so energetic after the "first" session.<br>  <br>  A year later, the wife gave birth to a "black" baby boy. When the baby grows up, he asks the father, "Pa, why am I black and you are white?"<br>  The father replied, "You are damn lucky already, my son, 5 sens more and you are PURPLE COLOR now!!!!!!"<br>  Ha-hah!<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS325&q=Jokes+about+the+color+purple&aq=f&oq=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&h...</a>|`|GnUvD5cvaa	easy!  what's a cat's fav color?

I call it improvisation.  That way, you get praised for originality and innovation rather than condemned for a screw-up.  The trick is, once you make the mistake, run with it and embellish on it.  All you need to make it would is a drummer.|`|lCoiqgpFaa	YES YES YES!!!!!!!<br>  i play guitar in a local band and we normally play in the coffee shop. <br>  i have messed up about 20 times on stage<br>  but the worst 1 was when i messed up HUGE on a SOLO!!!!!<br>  it really really sucked!|`|ec3E6gSbaa	Nope, But when I was playing in front of my school I broke a pick, and it made that weird sound.

cUjcn2lsaa	'The Universal'|`|L4f5ONEkaa	I like the universal out of those two even though it isnt my cup of tea but i could listen to it depending on my mood.  I like the vocals and the tempo on this song.  Also how its nice and slow and you can just chill and listen to it.  Its more of a relaxing song.  The meaning of the song is good too on how we are becoming less and less human and the effect it has on all of us.  Plus how in the future we will be less lively and more unhappy addicted to medications we dont need.  That we will use them just to get by and "live".|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	The Universal is one of the greatest songs of the 90's, I never tire of listening to it.

They're voices sound like they're sighing too much, and this new song was bad. The only reason their new show is gonna last a long time is because the simple fact that they are the Jonas Brothers. It looks funny but it would last nearly as long as it would if it were some other boy band.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, yes they are getting worse.|`|w1OG27LHaa	They only made that song out of fun. It really isnt a song to be taken serious. The Jonas Brothers are awesome and always will be. They were just having fun and that doesnt alter their talents.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped..<br>  x|`|V5K66Xb4aa	well being a teen sensation created by a cubicle worker who happens to not have a teenager is as low as you can go <br>  on the child star caste system, these hannah montana/ jonas bros are the leppers|`|VsbEGSmuaa	lol i like them a lot|`|duN63EkIaa	Well. I think their voices are just worn out from performing all the time. You can't blame them for that. <br>  <br>  Pizza girl was written for their Disney Channel queer show, not their CD. But yes, It's a lame song. Though it's not really the Jonas Brothers writting the songs on that show, it's the "lucas" brothers. So, it's going to be cheesy.<br>  <br>  They're writting their newest album with a more mature sound and 'depth', which I think will open a lot of people's eyes to their true talent. Steel guitar=yes.<br>  <br>  Cut the guys some slack. They're on the run every day of their lives, there's no sick days for them. Don't bash them for having an off day. Everyone does.

RFCcWPliaa	Haha, I'm really not sure but they're all pretty good. I'm guessing they'd need some kind of permission, but not directly from the artists. Most likely from the managers, procucers or lyricists.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! If you like that song, try Umbrella by All Time Low, but I bet you already know about that. So much better than Rihanna's version...|`|L4f5ONEkaa	Most likely because even people who make kids bop have to get permission for those lame *** kids to do remakes of songs.

geJM58L2aa	Yes!  I had to get my wisdom teeth cut out last April and was completely knocked out.  When I had my consultation, I thought my doctor was creepy, too.  He was kind of on the older side, had hair like a mad scientist, and told a bunch of jokes.  When I went in for the surgery, it ended up being him and 2 other assistants who were female in the room so I felt a little better about it.  Also, there was a camera in the room so my mother could watch me if she wanted.  Don't worry about it!|`|4vO41XV5aa	there will be lots of doctors in the room.<br>  dont worry im sure he has dont surgery lots of times its not his fault he looks creepy<br>  <br>  that thought never crossed my mind but there are usually like 5 people in the room so it wont just be him..hopefully for you|`|Qplaz9h3aa	Wow, that's actually pretty graphic. There are teenybopper's on this site, so warn them.<br>  <br>  But yeah, it has crossed my mind. That's why I don't go under anesthesia if I don't trust him completely. No creepers.|`|f0JL2cHEaa	Don't worry about it-- among the many nurses and other doctors in the room I'm sure one of them is morally right enough in the head to keep them from doing that.|`|1YNFFfmWaa	Don't worry doctors can't ever be alone with with a patient while their under anesthetics.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	My doctor is an 80 something year old woman. Molestation is the LEAST of my worries when she's doing an examination on me. :||`|hvKXPt3caa	Law forbids your doctor from performing surgery on his own... there must be a competent nurse and/or assistant with him at all times if something were to happen to him... since you could bleed to death !|`|ENAEcBOmaa	barfs all over keyboard*|`|dFVZlcwSaa	Yeah...  I've never had surgery but still the idea of being put in a flimsy gown with men all around you and you can't do anything...  Its like a creepers dream...<br>  <br>  <br>  O_o<br>  <br>  Can you request to have a female watching or something?|`|J8qvkWsNaa	One of the many reasons I'll never "go under" unless I absolutely have to.  I've had enough sexual assault in my life, thanks.|`|Hx2raTNQaa	Its illegal for one male to be alone with a female while under meds so it wont happen:D hope i helped:D|`|Dug6yDOLaa	why would a doctor be alone anyway??|`|dGFSQPlUaa	oh man. oh man!!!! now i will! thanks bunches! lol! good luck with that! haha!<br>  <br>  with other doctors bein in there i dont think it will happen! lol|`|NvKj6hKRaa	in a room full of nurses and other colleagues? not to mention the fact that I am sure he values his job more than some random feel he could cop|`|X8VsIqxaaa	yes!  but i suppose u wouldnt be left alone under anaesthetic, creepy thought tho isnt it!|`|x3RAaLfNaa	Sorry never thought about it.|`|JivLAZH6aa	it happens all the time here in washingto dc|`|IWzYB44raa	holy crap!

There is always more than one person in the room. I will say if you feel that way about this man then find another Dr!|`|KAkiPY3kaa	He will never, not for one second, be alone in that room while you are under. Trust me... hospital code. Not only for that kind of crap but if something goes wrong, people need to be there to help him.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Unless he has the other nurses under anesthetic.<br>  <br>  But seriously, that's really bad.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	He'd be fired so fast...<br>  Ask if you can have more than one person in the room, like your mom or a nurse you trust.|`|EmvOyF0zaa	yes it has and if you saw my last doctor you would have to

Also, because you sing metal, you are probably not adept or experienced in moving up to the higher register or head voice, because you are either using your voice improperly or without breath support.

Even in the realm of prog, there are several bands that I would say are their equals.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now..as for number one in recognition and sales, it would be Metallica followed by either Ozzy or Iron Maiden.<br>  <br>  But ... I am not really sure how one decides who is number 1.<br>  <br>  This certainly ain't to bash on anyones choice of #1..

It doesn't matter whether you like them or not. Just deal with it.  I don't really like the Jonas Brothers and I'm sick of hearing about them, but I don't go around complaining about it.|`|L94XXSO5aa	People do seem to really like things that just suck.  Tired pop music and pretty boys who are non-threatening but who subliminally sexualize themselves by repeating over and over how "pure" they are will always hold appeal for young people who know no better.|`|spFmMOL2aa	media coverage|`|eiYMk0Pgaa	well i love them and they think they do got talent|`|8gOR04Emaa	haha very funny dont waste ur time|`|ysUg2Rgraa	Look, there's' a TON of preteen/teen girls out there who like them, at least their not having sex,doing drugs, and come from a family with a good background.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Like the OTHER singers who appeal to kids, that do drugs & Have sex, etc. But, keep bringing on the thumbs down,losers.|`|Rf9eWfCvaa	Who knows why they're popular! Like you said they have no talent! I HATE them!!!!!!I hope it will end soon too! lol|`|svYiQZUHaa	Amen! and they are popular because of the horny tweens that can't keep their hormones in check.|`|l0pbK805aa	I think it's because some people think they are cute which they are not. BUt yea they have no talent what so ever.|`|Gs2fpVJfaa	because everyone thinks they are soo cute and stuff<br>  agh i hate them so fckin much<br>  yea i want them out of hollywood too|`|sxk08R2caa	because they are talented|`|YGYMocGRaa	clever businessmen are good at marketing. the jonas idiots are a product that needs to be sold. those people know how to|`|uvICu0gNaa	idk but all i know is that they SUCK|`|A0mkB10Uaa	Well, unless you can do any better than them, and know them personally, you really can't judge them at all.<br>  And if you have an opinion, you can very well keep it to yourself. <br>  Everyone has idols when they are young. Our parents were obsessed with bands to, our grandparents, even probably did.<br>  They are in the Grammys and such because they really are talented, according to many people.<br>  Honestly, when you become as famous as them, THEN you can judge them.|`|lCoiqgpFaa	i really dont like them either<br>  in fact i hate them<br>  but ppl like them cuz they class them as "hot"<br>  also, they r disney channel stars<br>  every single freakin disney channel star normally sucks and is over idolized<br>  i mean, look at Hannah Montana!<br>  her songs r so stupid and the show is even worse<br>  i dont want 2 b a fly on the wall!!!!!!!!!!!! and i wont ever want 2 b<br>  <br>  hope ive helped|`|hfb4Cv05aa	This proves my theory that chicks are just as horney as guys.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure those girls all think of flashing their mosquito bites to the Jonas Brothers.|`|Eu2Q5Qtbaa	They are still popular because of their appearance. I agree, they have no talent at all.|`|EQbW1RCxaa	Because there are a lot of crazy people out there and parents who use the t.v. as a babysitter.|`|JAe47ePJaa	Because ugly, fat, desperate little teenagers have the idea in their head that the J.B. love them?|`|7t5D5o6Paa	they're funded by disney thats why kind of like Miley Cyrus|`|Q3eZiD60aa	thats a good question

So what?<br>  <br>  Let's say that the rumor that Rihanna gave him herpes is true: He's still wrong. I don't give a **** she threw a shoe at him: HER FACE WAS USED AS A PUNCHING BAG. Get over your love for Chris Brown and look at a woman that was abused by her boyfriend. Domestic violence is never okay. <br>  <br>  Race SHOULD NOT be put into this.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	WOW...what a marvelous fabrication...|`|6KXv6qiDaa	Ok people who are saying there tired of hearing about rascism please just stfu bc until you live it you WILL NEVER KNOW...anyways umm to answer ur question Rihanna is not white ...sooooo. The ONlY reason people care about this is bc it was Rihanna which is extremely sad, If it was Rhonda no one would give a damn. Anyways people keep saying no man should hit a woman but i feel that is wrong and is why we have so much violence. If we simply said no one should hit no on then that would be much better. Personally if feel if ur man enough to hit a man then ur man enough to get hit. Some men can only take getting hit so much.|`|hfb4Cv05aa	I am pretty sure that you are terribly overreacting.<br>  <br>  In fact, I'm completely sure that this isn't a question, and just another chance for someone to point out racism, and rant about it. And I'm pretty tired of that.|`|1a685f3c1edd6d37412189b1e199def7aa	I think Angela Basset should slug the hell out of Chris Brown if she's dark enough for you.<br>  <br>  Chris, and OJ, are abusers.  The shade of skin Rhianna has and Nicole had is irrelevant.|`|2gyV8qLGaa	im white and i dont hate chris brown<br>  you're the racist one <br>  why dont i ask this question? "why are Black people always eating fried chicken?"|`|r4E2zXL8aa	I THINK YOU'RE THE RACIST, RETARD. I'M WHITE, AND I LOVE CHRIS BROWN!|`|BpyUcZ4Xaa	I'm white and I love Chris Brown :S Some of my best mates are black.<br>  <br>  What the hell?

AA11349364	I have no clue. I've seen the movie three times and paid careful attention and I still have no idea how it works. I suggest watching the film with any and all available commentaries on the DVD and see if they explain it. Try the special features as well.|`|a5063bee17bf974cdae3cb12947d9481aa	The point of the game is to test your poker face and wager your soul to Davy Jones crew. You roll the dice and bid on what you think is on the table. Don’t let that perspiration show. If you loose a challenge you’ll loose a die, and if you loose all your dice, then you’re out of the game. The pirates make guesses on how many of a number is on the table (i.e. I think five 3's are on the table) and you keep guessing until someone calls you on it then you have to prove it by showing your dice and your opponents dice. Honesty is not always the best policy. Bluffing your opponents is not only fun, but necessary for saving your soul from Davy Jones.|`|UTdosTITaa	I know that the film-makers had to come up with a game that could be played on a pirate ship and that would enable Will to bet his soul for the key. From watching it about a million times (lol go Johnny!), I think that the first number is a guess of the amount of dice with your chosen number on them. This number increases with each bet, decreasing your chances to guess correctly as the game goes on. The second number is the number that is shown on the dice (1-6). Also, a player is only allowed to see their own dice, and I believe the game is won by guessing exactly the correct amount of dice with the same number on them. I hope that answers your question.

HZxX9ke8aa	a. earth's gravity.<br>  b. earth's gravity (not sure what else)<br>  c. fluid in your ear works with gravity and special thingies in there sends signals to brain based on the angle of this fluid. this way, you maintain your balance. but when you spend time in space that fluid gets used to devoid of gravity so when you turn back to earth your legs gets shaky.<br>  <br>  also your muscles gets weaker since they gets used to devoid of gravity. if there's no gravity, that means nothing to resist against. so muscles gets lazy and unless you keep exercizing you get weaker.<br>  <br>  there was also something about sight which involved with how it is based on earth's horizon and stuff... but can't remember exactly. the thing i remember, when you spend so much time in space and back your vision also gets blurry though.<br>  <br>  oh, and what's amazing me the most how incredibly fast we are getting used to space conditions, how that ear fluid learns how to work in there, how our eyes stop measuring stuff with the horizon... i think this is a pretty good evidence for evolution.|`|4VNFsmanaa	I'm guessing gravity to all questions. Gravitational pull would keep them in orbit, and when it comes back, gravity would be pulling it down at a tremendous speed, causing friction. On how it affects the people, it depends on the type of rocket. I think generally it would kind of the same as being in a car, you're moving with it so it doesn't affect as much as not being enclosed.<br>  <br>  And PS, next time check the section before you post, and make sure not to misspell physics next time, lol

This was in the Director's cut of the movie. They show it on A&E sometimes. I was a bit surprised, because I had never seen the Director's cut before, and there were a lot of scenes deleted from the original.

2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	i honestly think this new system sucks. i really hate it, because talented people get eliminated with no reason..and dont have many chances to perform as other seasons.. i mean, there were lots of worst singers other seasons that performed two times (or more!!!),, and there are way better people this season that just performed once and got kicked off, just because of this new system..i really hate it!!|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	this years show is rubbish in my opinion there was no need for a 4th judge  she seems to have  upset the applecart big time ,  they should have left it as it was from previous years ,Simon .Randy & Paula enuf  said|`|Qp4vxEjzaa	I didn't like the way they were chosen. 3 groups of 12 performing each week is fine, but I wish all 12 would have been chosen in one episode out of all 36.<br>  <br>  Group 3 will perform next week, and 3 will be chosen from that group.

1YNFFfmWaa	Yes, it's that magical time of year again when the Darwin Awards are bestowed, honoring the least evolved among us.<br>  Here is the glorious winner:<br>  <br>  1. When his 38 caliber revolver failed to fire at his intended victim during a hold-up in Long Beach , California would-be robber James Elliot did something that can only inspire wonder. He peered down the barrel and tried the trigger again. This time it worked.<br>  And now, the honorable mentions:<br>  <br>  2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat cutting machine and after a little shopping around, submitted a claim to his insurance company. The company expecting negligence sent out one of its men to have a look for himself. He tried the machine and he also lost a finger. The chef's claim was approved.<br>  <br>  3. A man who shoveled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car during a blizzard in Chicago returned with his vehicle to find a woman had taken the space. Understandably, he shot her.<br>  <br>  4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting from Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his incompetence, the driver went to a nearby bus stop and offered everyone waiting there a free ride. He then delivered the passengers to the mental hospital, telling the staff that the patients were very excitable and prone to bizarre fantasies. The deception wasn't discovered for 3 days.<br>  <br>  5. An American teenager was in the hospital recovering from serious head wounds received from an oncoming train. When asked how he received the injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how close he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit.<br>  <br>  6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he got from the drawer... $15. [If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, is a crime committed?]<br>  <br>  7. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. The liquor store window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape.<br>  <br>  8. As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, "Yes, officer, that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from."<br>  <br>  9. The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 5 A.M., flashed a gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away. [*A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER]<br>  <br>  10. When a man 20 attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find a very sick man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges saying, that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.<br>  In the interest of bettering mankind, please share these with friends and family...unless of course one of these individuals by chance is a distant relative or long lost friend. In that case, be glad they are distant and hope they remain lost.<br>  *** Remember... They walk among us!!! <br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Toward the end of Sunday service, the Minister asked, 'How many of you have forgiven your enemies?'<br>  80% held up their hands.<br>  The Minister then repeated his question. All responded this time, except one small elderly lady.<br>  'Miss Joyce''; 'Are you not willing to forgive your enemies?'<br>  I don't have any.' She replied, smiling sweetly.<br>  'Miss Joyce', that is very unusual. How old are you?'<br>  'Ninety-eight.' she replied.<br>  'Oh, Miss. Joyce, would you please come down in front & tell us all how a person can live ninety-eight years & not have an enemy in the world?'<br>  <br>  The little sweetheart of a lady tottered down the aisle, faced the congregation, and said:<br>  <br>  'I outlived the bitche|`|FLJCEvvXaa	LOL curious p that made me smile and i dunno why its not that funny lol ^.^<br>  <br>  A grade 12 class has recetly been given the privelige by the principal to use lipstick at school, but immediately there were problems. The girls has been putting kiss prints all over the mirror in the girl's bathrooms, and it was getting annoying to have to clean it off. Every evening, the janitor cleaned off the kisses, and still, every day there were new kisses.<br>  <br>  The principal decided to show how difficult and tedious it was for the janitor to clean the mirrors, so she brought all the 12th graders into the bathroom. She asked the janitor to show how he cleaned the mirrors each day. So the janitor dipped his squeegy in the toilet and started cleaning off kisses.<br>  <br>  Since then there have been no more kisses on the mirrors.<br>  <br>  <br>  ROFLMFAO GINGER THAT LAST ONE IS GOOD|`|G26O8ecfaa	Mistaken Drunk<br>  <br>  A drunk phoned police to report that thieves had been in his car. <br>  <br>  "They've stolen the dashboard, the steering wheel, the brake pedal, even the accelerator," he cried out. <br>  <br>  However, before the police investigation could start, the phone rang a second time and the same voice came over the line. <br>  <br>  "Never mind," he said with a hiccup, "I got in the back seat by mistake."|`|KM5MNRJmaa	a duck walks into a pharmacy and asks "got any nails?" the pharmacist raises his eyebrows curiously and says "no this is a pharmacy! you should try the hardware store next door" the duck says thanks and leaves. the next day hes back and asks "got any nails?" the pharmacist replies "no! i told you yesterday, we don't carry nails! try the hardware store next door!" the duck says thanks and leaves again. the next day the same duck is back with the same question "got any nails?" the pharmacist is annoyed and shouts "NO! listen here! we don't carry nails! if you come back tomorrow asking for nails i'm going to staple your feet to the counter!!" the duck says thanks and leaves once more. the next day he wanders in again and this time asks "got any staples?" the pharmacist is thoroughly puzzled and annoyed and tells him no.

The startled tiger turns around and says, "Hey! Cut it out, all right!" <br>  <br>  The rear tiger says, "sorry," and they continue. After about another five minutes, the rear tiger again reaches out with his tongue and licks the bottom of the tiger in front. The front tiger turns around and cuffs the rear tiger and says, "I said stop it!" <br>  <br>  The rear tiger says, "sorry," and they continue. After about another five minutes, the rear tiger once more licks the bottom of the tiger in front. The front tiger turns around and asks the rear tiger, "What is it with you, anyway?" <br>  <br>  The rear tiger replies, "Well, I just ate a lawyer and I'm trying to get the taste out of my mouth!"|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	The head pharmacist goes out to lunch leaving the assistant pharmacist in charge.When the head pharmacist returns from lunch he notices a man leaning against the wall.He asked the assistant what was wrong with the man leaning against the wall over there.The assistant pharmacist says,"Oh that guy.Oh yeah he came in a little while ago with a really bad cough so I sold him a laxative.He seems to be doing ok now.....

It's like the Hollows are the Death Gods... and Reapers are the ones who get them to the other side... <br>     The correct translation for Shinigami is Death God... but they aren't death gods in bleach coz they don't harm anyone... just protect the real world from bad souls like hollows and then send them to soul society... <br>     But the Death God in Death Note is more realistic, monsterous, interesting and cool... in Bleach they're just Samurais... <br>  <br>    anyway...

I liked Slumdog more because there is a message beyond the hurt and pain and reality of facts, there is a message of hope in this film and that message is: Anyone can dream and hope for a better life and if you don't allow life to beat you down, if you don't give up on yourself, you too can succeed. <br>  WWW.DSCGOURMET.COM Best gourmet gift baskets in all of LA|`|0NCqukPRaa	slumdog millionaire has cool songs on the soundtrack they sound arabic, there cool, i think im in love with slumdog millionaire!!1|`|1U9oBUrvaa	slumdog millionaire is hella sick<br>  <br>  the reader's hella boring|`|bm11Oz8Aaa	i hvnt either but slumdog millionare won somthing for being a good movie :)|`|1BakOTf6aa	slumdog millionaire over and over again!|`|0OO1IE0Vaa	Slumdog Millionare was a lot more exciting

What I do is I find a song I like, find out the artist and look up that artist through you tube, or myspace music, or some sort of medium like that where I can watch videos and listen to tracks. You can then search for free mp3's because you know iTunes isn't going to have it.  I like to use bittorrent and do a torrent search.  Doing that, I am able to download an artists full discography in one swoop.
XQMm3Ahraa	go to youtube and there are tutorials on how to get macromedia flash for free (just search how to get macromedia flash) or the cheapest good program you can get costs bout 60$ called anime studio and it is rather good quality as well your preference howevar|`|YSIem55Maa	getting flash for free is illegal...I wouldn't do that. If you'd like to do sprite animation, you can make them with just a photo editor and windows movie maker. If you want to make a cartoon though, you should probably just buy a program unless you absolutely can't buy it and have to get it illegally.

qswrz268aa	You picked my favorite series!!! Piano adventures is what I grew up on! Its the best! I also use it to teach my students. Of course I use the un-adult version for my young students. The adult books are good too, they just move slightly faster, and leave out some more childish stuff.<br>  <br>  Great pick! I highly recommend it. <br>  <br>  Cheerio|`|vQTYDR1oaa	Hi, here are my recommendations:<br>  <br>  1) Carol Barratt - The Classic Piano Course Book 1 (Starting to play)<br>  <br>  2) Alfred's Classic Editions: Very first Piano Solo book<br>  <br>  3) Alfred's Classic Editions: Czerny Op. 599 Practical Method for beginners on the piano<br>  <br>  4) Alfred's Basic Adult Theory Piano Book Level 1 OR Eric Taylor's Grade 1 Piano Theory Book<br>  <br>  5) ABRSM Scales & Arpeggios Grade 1<br>  <br>  I started with these last time when I started learning the piano as an adult learner.|`|7UExQ4VVaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I used to work in music retail, so hopefully can help a little!<br>  <br>  The Faber method is good, but in my opinion it's not the best for self-teaching adults. I'd recommend Alfred's Basic All-in-one Adult Piano Course book. It contains lessons to help you develop your skills, theory exercises for a better understanding of musical concepts, and technique so that you can best express yourself through the piano :) All of these things in one book with a CD, for about $20!<br>  <br>  Bastien's Beginning Method is very good too. It includes similar lessons, theory, and technique instructions found in Alfred's but presented in a slightly different way. This method sells for between $15-$25 with or without the CD.<br>  <br>  Faber is a good lesson book but in general you have to buy the theory, technique, performance, etc. books separately. (You can get an all-in-one, but it seems most stores don't have it in stock so it must be ordered.) The separate books costs between $6-$8. Also, I'm pretty sure the Faber method wasn't intended for self-study...<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to visit a music store that has a wide variety of methods for beginning adults. Find a sales associate who can help you to compare and contrast the different methods so you can decide which series will be best for you. Good luck!<br>  <br>  (sorry, this ended up a long post somehow...!)|`|PVhIQCh9aa	the  piano learning series by alfred is a good start
418dfb37a96ceb9948ed16cc3a9857e1aa	Hey it's me Ashley. Beauty*Queen is my friend. And yes I gave her my password.<br>  <br>  Toodles,<br>  <br>  ~ Ash<br>  <br>  Sure you are Ashley. Only I am ok?|`|16be70a6930dbf796981595e45bf88f6aa	there is no way that ashley tisdale had met beauty queen becaus elook have u seen that when ashely asks a question like "which song on mine do u like the best?" beauty queen goes insane saying things like"OMG you are the best i wish i could meet you!!!"   so ya see by just some simple background checks you can tell whether some one is an imposter or not|`|47c58541f19af9c33fb4f682e2bdf050aa	Heya that's me! Yeah I met them, we are friends. Fine I will e-mail you from Ashley Tisdale's e-mail, she gave me her password.<br>  <br>  <br>  *** I already e-mailed her ***<br>  <br>  Cutie_Pie whatever your name is, your not Ashley. Suite_Life_Maddie is. You just changed your name to Ashley Tisdale. Who cares?!<br>  <br>  Yeah I said that because I met her like 2 weeks ago. Gosh. What's your problem!!! She is real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12223664	Beauty Queen? You went to hollywwod? -.- It cant be true... Ashlty Tisdale's email rite!!<br>  <br>  amy tell me if thats true when ''she'' emails u!<br>  <br>  Please...you are using both accounts... even I could be Ashley Tisdale<br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT HER OK!! SHE IS NOT ON THIS WEBSITE!<br>  STUPID PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT -.-|`|AA11688449	None of you guys know her and if you do, she wouldn't like it if you gave her email out to all of her fans......I am not saying that you do not know her but I am saying the 2 on here acting like her are not her...she has better things to do than to get on yahoo answers...Also, no celebrity would give their email password out to any friends. if they did then there friends could give out all this private information without them know!!! so goodluck on impersonation, I am sure it will get you far in life

You shouldn't have let him do anything to you without a condom you live with your parents and they take care of you so who gone take care of your baby YOUR PARENTS tsk tsk tsk|`|D3ep2x7caa	you are the one who had sex in the first place, so YOU are the one who suffers any consequences. your boyfriend saying its okay to not use a condom doesnt make it okay to not use one. im sorry if you are pregnant, and im sorry that you made the stupid desision to even let it be a possibility. my advice is to tell your mom and have you tested. its what id do. it may seem stupid to you, because im sure you dont want to get it trouble, it'd be better telling her now than later.|`|Xuw8v8bPaa	The best thing to do is take a test and hope for the best.

Give it another week or two. <br>  <br>  It is NOT fine to not use a condom. If you had used a condom, you wouldn't be worrying like you are now. If you think you are ready for sex then you MUST be responsible.|`|NAwzuLayaa	You should go to the store or get someone who can buy you a first response pregnancy test, they can tell you the results I believe 5 days before your missed period. You can also visit a free clinic and get tested. Remember,  you may have not made the best decision...but for future references....safe-sex is smart-sex. An STD or other diseases can ruin your life and quite possibly end it just because you were young a naive.

Second, get a test or wait for your period. If it never comes then the chances are you're pregnant. Once is all it takes to get pregnant. And if it was half in then it might as well have been all the way in. It doesn't make a difference.|`|LhrR6O3uaa	First learn proper grammar.|`|JyeYBNPfaa	Well, chances are you are NOT. It often takes a few tries to get pregnant. Some people try for years. So I would bet money that you're not.<br>  <br>  Just stay calm unless your period's late. If it's late then you have no choice but to tell your parents and go through giving birth.<br>   <br>  If you're going to do that stuff, you should be married to the person you're "doing it" with, though. You don't want a child outside of marriage. The guy can leave you in five seconds if you're not married.|`|YXyI4eQlaa	thats your faul if you are good luck|`|AA10331655	WEll I think first of all if you let your boyfriend talk you into not wearing a condom at 14 your too young to have sex but whatever....it's to early to tell but there is a good chance you could have gotten pregnant...and if you are tell your parents|`|05KIqj26aa	GET CHECK...Y WOULD SOMEONE NOT USE A CONDOM..dere are alot of stuff out there now adays..But u gotta wait and if u r pregnant ur parents r gonna kill U and da baby|`|YqOYJXlVaa	maybe um i don't know, not have unprotected sex at 14?? i don't know, just throwing the idea out there....<br>  <br>  take a test. and youre really stupid. you shouldn't bring a child inoto the world when you're playing on y!a. start praying hon.|`|IGPMqhjKaa	i dunno if your on ur period or should be maybe, go to a free clinic, they dont need parental aproval and you can go for well free and they will give you help.<br>  <br>  also a pregnency test would help too in about 5 days!|`|eCi4UsCAaa	Maybe save your virginity till college at least!<br>  14?! why waste it away now.<br>  just get a test.<br>  hopefully no one does that ever.<br>  Good Luck=]|`|vgCw179baa	ur insaine to have had sex at 14|`|Ue1QgNAUaa	get tested<br>  and u r CRAZY to have sex at 14<br>  if u r prgnent ur boy marry u at 14 <br>  and who knos he even might DUMP U<br>  u dump him first LOL<br>  GOOD LUCK!! hope for the best|`|qCE6YWFbaa	how should I know...do you feel pregnant?<br>  don't listen to your stupid boyfriend..always wear a condom!|`|JivLAZH6aa	my heart goes out to you if you are preggo|`|DK6kYxmGaa	How sad---first of all, at your age you shouldn't be having sex----number 1 reason is because you can't afford a BABY!!!!  Babies cost alot----anyways, if you're so worried about, then that should be your first clue why you shouldn't have sex in the first place.<br>  <br>  Sex is soppose to be a wonderful thing between to grow-ups that can afford a baby if one did come alone. Sex is not soppose to create guilt and worry about "what happenes if my parents find out?!?!?!?!". <br>  <br>  Anyways, when I was 11, I knew an 11 year old girl who had sex with her 23 year old boyfriend. She got pregnant, and 9 months later when she was 12, she had her first adorable baby. Unfortantly, once again, she was not old enought to the support the baby herself, so her mom had the wonderful blessing of taking care of her baby girl and her grandaughter. <br>  <br>  So for further advice----WAIT until you're old enough to have sex (preferably married); when you are, then you won't have have guilt or worry about your parents finding out. I'm 22 years old, and I'm waiting until I get married so that I enjoy sex without having guilt of my parents finding out, or possibly getting pregnant with some guy's kid who doesn't even care about me or the child.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|YHvbL7VVaa	ru kidding me????????????!!!!!!! omg im 14 and would never dream of doing that! but thats not gunna help u now i guess....<br>  <br>  u should tell someone.... like ur mom or a teacher at school to help u. see your doctor or something. That is just so stupid, im sorry.<br>  <br>  Hope everything goes well though........|`|kLlA2JTjaa	It's always nice to know 14 year olds who can't even SPELL are out having Kids..

0de24d364fe74324f8edb125f9d6917aaa	Asia is far too big of a b!tch to win. She looks like she could be violent and turn on you at any moment. Sometimes, she is cool and sometimes she is super-b!tch, She just constantly has that b!tch face on.<br>  <br>  Also, she has a kid she needs to be taking care of. --and do you really want her as a role model for kids? she is 18 and has a 2 yr old? that mean she got knocked up at 15 or 16---that is NOT a role model. PCD are ho'ish already, but she'd trump them up to HO PATROL w/her teenage wh0re antics.<br>  <br>  I want Chelsea to win, OR Melissa. They are both sweet yet, hard workers and they both have beautiful voices.<br>  I think Melissa is stronger w/the dancing and Chelsea is stronger with the singing.<br>  <br>  I really doubt Asia has a chance w/all her baggage. and I am glad, she is NOT a nice person.

She's a great dancer and singer/preformer, she's pretty, her personality would just go great with the Pussycat Dolls!!! I quote Robin Antin " I just think she has the WHOLE pacage"  She can go all they way!!!!!! If Melissa R doesn't win I will die!! I will cry so much!!!!I was mad when I found out that in the finally Asia is yelliing at Melissa R!!! Asia can't fit in with the Pussycat Dolls if she yells at them!!! She's a Drama Queen...plus I also think she shouldn't be away from her baby...Chelsea shoildn't be a Pussycat Doll because SHE CAN'T DANCE!!!! I mean come on how can u make it this far without dancing skills!!!! And Chelsea also starts alot of drama she says nasty thing how can u have that in the Pussycat Dolls?!?!?!?!!?<br>  <br>  GO Melissa Reyes!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  xoxo <333|`|HZn6Hyz3aa	I don't watch it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :o)

Sisely sucks, and she is just jealous of all of the other girl and makes excuses. Chelsea can't dance, and her voice is way to deep to be in the pcd. the rest aren't bad, but my favorite person is Asia.<br>  <br>  just because she has a baby doesnt' mean she doesnt' deserve to win.

tnunbQ72aa	honestly, jealousy.<br>  why else would you hate someone you dont know?<br>  doesnt make sense.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I agree...I can't stand it when people, for example, say "I hate Miley Cyrus", yet they don't even know her personally. People are often too quick to judge. <br>  Besides, they're celebrities, you can't believe everything you hear about them, because a lot of it is fake.<br>  <br>  edit: wow, thumbs down for stating the truth. good one guys!|`|mZUXkeyRaa	I know right!<br>  I agree with you<br>  I think part of it is jealousy (waiting to get thumbs down for that)<br>  I mean, Celebs are loaded with money, and stuff. Im jealous of them, lol!<br>  No one knows celebs<br>  So its dumb when they say OMG I hate them!<br>  Also, I hate how here on yahoo Answers<br>  They go into the Celeb Section, when they dont even like any celebs<br>  Its like, Why are you here then??|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Ever thought it's because some celebrities are just so superficial and incredibly stupid?<br>  <br>  You don't know them either; it's the equivalent of someone saying, "OMG, I love the Jonas Brothers". They don't know them!<br>  <br>  Appearances, public persona, and actions say a lot about a person and that's why we can judge celebrities. They are in the spotlight to be judged and if they don't like it, too bad.<br>  <br>  And, it is not about jealousy. I am certainly not jealous of celebrities who are just as flawed as everybody I know. Money and fame have nothing to do with it, and anybody who says it does clearly needs to evaluate themselves first.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	No, I don't know everything about them but I also don't want to hear all the things I do, every time I just want to watch tv.<br>  <br>  I don't hate celebs in general.  Sometimes I like to watch the gossip, it is like my guilty pleasure.  For the most part I could care less.|`|6zXpA0PNaa	People who put themselves out there in the public eye are going to get ridiculed for any reason. <br>  <br>  It's just stupid or lost people who are using that to supress their own security.<br>  <br>  I use to do that about Jessica Alba. I personally do not think she is as attractive as most people say and I use to get jealous of the attention she got and I thought there were much more attractive girls that do not get that kind of attention and she's Spanish and so am I, and to me, she looks common. Then I realized I was doing that because I wished I got that kind of attention. Personally, I'm much more intimidating and other girls as well, and she, well, let's be honest, she looks like she couldn't hurt a fly....but so what, some people like girls like that and I accepted it. She looks attanable, humble, and gentle and that is a good quality for most men she she wouldn't crush a man's (or woman's) ego as much as say, Angelina Jolie, Kiera Knightly, or Namoi Watts would. They do not smile as much and play "the love interest" or "airhead super hero" as much.<br>  <br>  In a way, celebrities are kind of asking for it. That doesn't mean that it is okay to waste your time doing that though. It's pathetic.|`|3ok7pKMNaa	I personally believe that most people are jealous of the accomplishments that most celebs have gotten. Miley Cyrus is one of those big ones. She's living her dream and getting F-bombed for it! RIDICULOUS!!! If only we learned to love...|`|JqF7Swwjaa	who cares? they shoulda thought about that bedore they became famous, this is the real world, their are people who have it harder, stop feeling bad for them, this is the real world, everyones got it tough, and most famus people enjoy hate because it makes them more famous...yall dont have a lick of information how it really goes|`|7t5D5o6Paa	No one can really judges celebrities (with some exceptions) because you don't know the person. They could be completely different from how the media portrays them. They are not like how they act in the movies!|`|EQbW1RCxaa	I love celebrities.  They give me tons of stuff to write about on my blog.  I'm not gonna spam, but if anybody want to they can google my name for a clue.

ajrXIiZcaa	I loved it too! What happened is that near the end of last year, ABC announced that they would not be ordering more episodes, in effect cancelling the series. I had hoped at that point they'd air the remaining episodes, as I believe there are three or four still left that have been made, but haven't aired.<br>  <br>  I've read rumors that ABC will air the last episodes eventually, or they'll release them on DVD, or show them on another channel (ABC Family maybe?). I've also read that some people have heard that they're air online, on ABC's website.<br>  <br>  Oh...here you go:<br>  <br>  "On November 20, 2008, ABC told the show's producers that it had opted not to order any new episodes, signaling that the series would be cancelled once all the episodes were used up.[8]<br>  <br>  The last scheduled episode of Eli Stone aired on December 30, 2008. Four episodes remain unaired and it is currently unknown whether ABC will air these episodes.<br>  <br>  ABC is in negotiations to bring unaired episodes of Eli Stone to ABC.com without broadcast rights.[9][10] Some overseas networks may air these episodes."|`|xv7YlV29aa	I'm not sure.

JswqZWGUaa	While a group of friends are out sailing, one of them goes swimming and discovers a body at the bottom of the ocean. Seaman Russell McDonald's body was in found in the Bahamas, which is near Puerto Rico. That gets Dinozzo started on how much he loves Puerto Rico. McDonalds body had a sword and had chains with weights hooked to them wrapped around his waist. Dinozzo and Todd go to tell McDonald's mother about him. His mother told them about his father and how he dies when he was 12. She also told them that he wasn't the type of person who would kill himself. Gibbs, Todd and Dinozzo settle into the ship that McDonald was in and start investigating. Everyone tells them that McDonald kept to himself. Agent Gibbs interviews Petty Officer Carnahan whom tells him he didn't know him. Agent Dinozzo interviews McDonalds C. O. who said that McDonald was very intelligent but hasn't been focused lately. So far, he is the only one who believes McDonald would kill himself. Agent Todd talks with his Medical corpsman who stated that McDonald was troubled but doesn't believe he would kill himself. She also tells her about how he was obsessed with a person who was there, but wasn't really there. So, he had a sword he wasn't suppose to have, he was found at the bottom of the ocean with weights, his C.O. believes he that would commit suicide but his mother and his corpsman doesn't. He was also teaching himself how to use that sword from a book Agent Gibbs found in his rack. On a video line, Abby informs Gibbs, Todd and Dinozzo that she found a St. Christopher medal and a character charter for a fantasy game; a massive multi-player on-line role-playing game MMORPG. She also noticed that the sword had nicks in it, possibly was in contact with another sword. So Todd goes investigates that while Abby will try to find out what type of game McDonald was playing and what type of files he had in that game. Gibbs and Dinozzo talked with Ducky next. He found dirt under McDonald's fingernails; the dirt was from the sea floor. With that, he comes to the conclusion that McDonald was still alive when he went into the water. Later on, Dinozzo finds out that McDonald probably got the sword from the Base Exchange Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and the only way he could get one if the cashier wasn't checking IDs. No one is allowed to have swords on board, so if he had one, he would have to hide it. Meanwhile, Gibbs talks with a captain and is informed that if two of his men wanted to stage swords fights and not get caught, they would probably do it in, Damage control, in the machine room at night. While Abby works on MMORPG, Todd talks with the corpsman again to find out if there were any injuries reported that could help. Later, Dinozzo informs Gibbs about the swords and Abby calls Gibbs and tells him that she found a game site called "The Immortals" McDonald frequently went to. His character name was Waylin. The charter she found on him referred to his main rival knight Kinvaras. Their main mode of combat was "Parle", which means Sword Fighting. She also discovered that the guy who plays Kinvaras, logs on from the foster, the ship that Gibbs, Dinozzo, and Todd are on. Gibbs believes that McDonald found out who Kinvaras was and that he was on the ship and decided to take it to the next level. So, if they both had swords, chances are they had to have bought it at the Naval Base Exchange in Puerto Rico. So Dinozzo offers to go down to Puerto Rico, pretend to buy a sword, expose the clerk and find out what he can. Back at Navy NCIS headquarters, Abby finds McDonald's "Weylin's" Profile on Immortals and now has to find out the password to access the information. Meanwhile in Puerto Rico, Agent Dinozzo cons a clerk into selling him a sword and then tells her he's really Navy NCIS and needs to find out who else she has sold swords to. Down in the control room, Gibbs and Todd find scratches on poles; scratches that look like a sword hit it. While discovering more of them, Todd gets into a conversation about McDonald being a Catholic and that he would never commit suicide. Being that she's Catholic herself, she would know because it's suicide is not part of their culture. Dinozzo calls Gibbs and informs him that the Base Exchange was selling swords illegally. They did sell one to McDonald and to three others who Dinozzo has a description of. Later, Gibbs and Todd go through each Seaman's file that matches the description Dinozzo gave them. They run across Petty Officer Ronald Zuger file and learn that he had a cut on his arm from a glass but there weren't any glass shards in the wound. He also matches one of the descriptions that Dinozzo provided. Gibbs finds him on the computer playing a sword-fighting round in Immortals. Meanwhile Abby gets access to McDonald's password on Immortals and skims through his numerous journal entries. She then calls Gibbs but Todd picks up instead. Abby informs Todd that she got into McDonald's journal; Todd offers to read|`|Cqwow19waa	bart fart<br>  and homer took poop

But if I told some of that stuff to like another friend, they might look at me strangely.|`|CU3hW5iRaa	i'm the same way.  you can entertain yourself alright but when it comes to other people making sense of it it's not happenin|`|D6M975deaa	That so called joke just put me in a bad mode.

oCXlzY04aa	soft porn to me was lke the scenes in sex and the city...it showed real grafic nudity and sex scenes...and it would be rated r or unrated most of the time...another example is hustle and flow|`|Ie9s1Z8kaa	Softcore pornography is a form of filmic or photographic pornography or eroticism that is less sexually explicit than hardcore pornography. Softcore pornography depicts nude and semi-nude performers engaging in casual social nudity or non-graphic representations of sexual intercourse or masturbation. Soft core porn precludes explicit depictions of vaginal or anal penetration, cunnilingus, fellatio and ejaculation. Such acts are routinely obscured using various means, including draped hair or clothing, carefully positioned hands or other body parts, carefully positioned foreground elements in the scene (often plants or drapery), and contrived camera angles. Genital close-ups and erect penises are usually kept to a minimum (if shown at all), though full frontal nudity is common. Female full frontal nudity is common, while male frontal nudity is far less common.<br>  <br>  In most cases the sexual acts depicted in softcore pornography are entirely simulated by the actors. No actual penetration occurs. Often the actors wear latex genital covers to prevent physical contact. Film directors go to great lengths to obscure such covers on screen, but often fail to completely hide them.  Rated R thats as bad as it gets   <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mpaa.org/</a>

It is illgal to distribute illegal stuff but not illegal to download in Canada. I found a great site as an example of this if anyone is interested.

She lives in a academy and is a day class student. Her only memory when she was young was of her being attacked by a vampire and night class student, Kaname, saving her. She has a long crush on him and wishes to protect him. Her foster father is the principal of the school. She also has a good friend named Zero. The tale goes on and on about all of the drama. And the season that follows it is Vampire Knight Guilty.<br>  <br>  Uh...<br>  <br>  There's Mermaid Melody. It's an anime about um... mermaid princesses. There's the main character Luchia who is the mermaid princess of the North Atlantic Ocean (hopefully I got the ocean right). She rescued a young boy from being drowned. It's basically a magical girl anime that sings in the show.<br>  <br>  Fruits Baskets is one of the best anime I have ever seen. It's about a young girl named Tohru Honda. Her mother died in a car accident and she's been living in a tent in the forest. Until one day one of Tohru's classmates saw her living in the tent. His name is Yuki. (hope i got the right name) He offers her a chance to live in his house with his...uncle (i think) Shigure. But there's a strange thing about the family. They change into the animals of the Zodiac when hug the opposite gender that isn't in the Zodiac family. Yuki-mouse Shigure-dog Then another character comes...his name is Kyo. He has a bit of an anger temperature and dreams of defeating Yuki in a fight. He is the banished cat. So the anime tells about the romances.<br>  <br>  Wedding Peach is another romantic anime. It's a bit old but very good. It's about a girl named Momoko. She has pink hair. Until one day her life completely changes when she changes into Wedding Peach. The one who stops the Devils from taking over the Earth and the Angel world. She has other allies too. Then she falls in love with a boy. Then it tells about the adventures and romance.<br>  <br>  ULTRA MANIAC!! I saw that a long time ago so some things might  be wrong. There's this girl named Nina who is a magical girl. She has this small computer that has magic. Nina has a friend named Tateshi. Tateshi has a crush on the most popular guy in school. (LOVE IN THE AIR!!) Nina is competing with other magical girls to win the heart of the prince. In the competion they have to collect these ....gems i think that will make the prince be theirs. But soon Nina has another romance.<br>  <br>  Tokyo Mew Mew!! It's about this girl named Ichigo. She has a crush on the most popular, cutest guy in school. One day her normal life changes. Two men sent this red wave that changes Ichigo. She turns into...a kinda cat girl. She battles against the evils that want to take over the world. She has other friends that help her with this task. The anime shows all the missions and romances.<br>  <br>  Ouran High School Host Club is AWESOME!!! It's about this young girl named Haruhi. At first she looks like a boy. "He" went to the third music trying to find a quiet place to study. There "he" stumbled upon the host club. "He" (notice i'm putting quotes around he) accidently knocked over their vase that cost A LOT of yen. So he has to repay that money by working for them until graduation. They find out he looks good if they clean him up so they make him a host. "He" has to get 100 customers to repay his debt. Then they find out that he's actually a she but they still make her be a host. So the Host Club has to keep the secret and show all the funny things that happen along the way.<br>  <br>  That's all I got that are pretty good anime. Hope this helps.|`|EIHJNusPaa	Special A- Hikari Hanazono, the main character, has always been second to Kei Takishima. While Hikari considers Kei a rival and somewhat of a friend, Kei loves Hikari. Everyone knows this, but she is too dense to notice. Their wrestling loving fathers first introduced them to one another when they were 6 years old. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, a sporting event - anything. To do this she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position.<br>  --<br>  Hikari has long hair. I assure you.

xHxcB3znaa	Stephan King novels are really good. One book that I have read from him that was good was "Cell". You could also give Mary Higgins Clark a try. She writes good mystery/crime books. That's all that I can think of. If you want more good books, you can search at barnesandnoble.com. That could narrow down your seach for you. Hope I was helpful.

She is currently in (or enrolled?) for the Redken cosmetology school. Lorelai has an up & coming clothing/make up/haircare line. <br>  <br>  <br>  Thats all I could find.

o2FJIXS9aa	At first she annoyed me, I started watching during hollywood week and she kept jumping up and dancing around and looking at the other judges all through the songs. The camera kept going to her, but that wasn't her fault.  I thought she was horrible. Now I am starting to like her better, I think she tries to be honest and give constructive advice. I heard Paula said she didn't need to be on the show and she fired back that she did. I think Paula with her same old sayings and compliments is getting to be a bit of a bore, and I think once Kara gets more experience, Paula should go packing. 3 judges is enough.|`|xl5uQj3daa	ARROGANT BI*CH , FEMALE SIMON|`|xv7YlV29aa	I think she is very good looking. She seems nice but then again if you watch her closely she is always making a face.

She seems nice but then again she seems like she could be a *****. But I like her. I hate Paula|`|AA11443469	I think shes the female version of simon, Paula doesnt like her and i think 4 is way too many judges and it takes too long to hear from anyone. I think she'll stay for this season but they wont renew her contract for the next season, unless they decide to boot one of the judges.|`|aENeoXGCaa	I didn't like her at all during the auditions. She seems to have softened up a lot now. I still think that Simon's comments are the best and the only honest and real ones on the show.<br>  <a href="http://www.dvdorderonline.com/products/American-Idol-Complete-Season-7-DVD-Boxset-DVDS-1537.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdorderonline.com/products/A...</a>

Each is vitally important. Any, if absent, could keep our new relationship from being complete.<br>  <br>  Our condition: First, we must understand that we are separated from God. The chasm dividing us is both wide and deep. We inherited a fatal defect at birth. As a result, we have lived our lives independently from him. The Bible emphasizes this stark reality: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). If we can’t come to grips with the fact that sin separates us from God, we’ll never come home spiritually, for there is no need for a savior. <br>  <br>  God’s remedy: Second, we need to be very clear in understanding who Jesus is and what he has done for us, in order that we might confidently place our faith in him. He bridged the chasm separating us from God. In the apostle John’s words: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).<br>  <br>  Jesus was not just a good man, a great teacher, an inspired prophet. He came to earth as the Son of God. As promiesed to be born mighty God and the prince of peace (Isaiah 9:6) He was born to a virgin (Isaiah 7:14). He led a sinless life. He died. He was buried. He rose again on the third day. He ascended into heaven where he became both Lord and Christ. <br>  <br>  Jesus’ death and resurrection on our behalf satisfied God’s requirement – complete provision for our sin. This Jesus, and he alone, is qualified to be the remedy for my sin and yours.<br>  <br>  Our response – to repent and believe.<br>  <br>  Revelation 3:19&20 "I love you, and ask you to repent quickly. Behold I am at your heart's door asking to come in, if you ask me in, I will come in and be your best friend/sup with you/begin a fellowship with you and you with me.<br>  <br>  Personal repentance is vital in the transformation process. Repentance literally means “a change of mind.” It is to say to the Father, “I want to turn toward you and away from the life I’ve lived independently from you. I am sorry for who I’ve been and what I have done and I want to permanently change. I receive your forgiveness for my sins.”<br>  <br>  Many at this point experience a remarkable “washing” from a lifetime’s accumulation of all that can degrade a person’s soul and spirit. Whether or not we sense God’s forgiveness, if we repent, we can be very certain that we’re forgiven. Our confidence is based on God’s promise to us, not how we feel. <br>  <br>  We come into a personal relationship with the Lord when we make life’s greatest decision – the turning point referred to earlier. It is to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, the One who died for our sins, who was buried and was raised from the dead – and to receive him as our Savior and Lord. When we believe in this way, we become God’s children. This is emphatically promised in John’s gospel: “To all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).<br>  <br>  Would you like to receive Jesus Christ as your savior? If you would, you can pray a prayer like this:<br>  <br>  “Jesus, I need you. I repent for the life I’ve lived apart from you. Thank you for dying on the cross to take the penalty for my sins. I believe you are God’s Son and I now receive you as my Savior and Lord. I commit my life to follow you.”<br>  <br>  Did you pray this prayer?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  still have questions write me at DavidA7israel@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  good question, thanks David|`|TYKMdNmMaa	Home coffee even drunk through a s hitty diaper is better than Starbucks|`|pWCEwnvZaa	home coffee<br>  i always drink starbucks, but if i have to choose, i will also pick seatle's best.|`|evtL7sUqaa	STARBUCKS as I like the cups, (Thats right,I steal the mugs and put them in my bag and walk home)|`|foWmh4Ohaa	Starbucks.. it makes me feel cool lol :)|`|MO6QOpKQaa	Home coffee is WAY cheaper.|`|I2ZMRXNXaa	home coffee made from your own hands is the best

c5ddd104f3448dce1dd84bc53f783736aa	Wanted to let everybody here know, it's very possible Macy's used a music house (professional studio) to have this re-recorded. I am a music supervisor for TV ads and this is commonly done. People will redo a song soley for a commercial and it may only even be 30-40 seconds at it's completion and NOT available to the public. It is very frustrating, I agree, especially in a case like this where the cover is great and unique, but that is how it goes. Lastly, I will say there is a push in the industry in cases like this where it's done so well for them to get it out to the public as a purchasable song because there is a demand for it. Hopefully, ad agencies will start to catch up with this and get some of these great songs out there...|`|d2c4c68d6b2184f9c6a068a03704fcf0aa	I think it's Sarah Valley.  I checked itunes and she is the only one that sounds similar to Target's commercial.|`|6756a9e882909560e251b6d0588a0939aa	Wow, that's really difficult. It might help you to know it's actually a Macy's commercial (it just played on my tv while I was sitting here.) But it's still seemingly impossible to find on the internet. Weird. There's even a page for this song on Wikipedia for the Beatles, and it says, "Used in a Macy's commercial in 2006" but there are no more details. Good luck!

The script, the costumes and sets, the music, everything was just PERFECT!!!<br>  <br>  I was most impressed by the action scenes, they were choreographed very nicely and looked pretty realistic. (OK, OK, the arterial spurt was wrong, there wasn't enough gushing blood and no sword, no matter how sharp, stays sharp long enough for you to hack that many people to death but let's overlook little details like that, OK?)<br>  <br>  I own swords and I know it's not easy to swing those babies for long, you really have to be in good shape and these guys really looked it! Like real warriors not the weekend warrior type. I mean, you could believe that they'd been training as warriors since they were kids. I know people say it's all digitally enhanced but I don't care. It looked pretty real when it needed to look real.<br>  <br>  OK, there was some gratuitous nudity (young "oracle" in flimsy gown, the Queen of Sparta flashing flesh, the king and queen in the bedchamber) to keep the young, testosterone laden men interested until the carnage but I guess that's only fair as we women were treated to the sight of all these buff guys in skimpy war outfits.<br>  <br>  The bad guys were suitably bad, LOL! It cracks me up to see the people posting here at YA that are saying it's an anti-Iranian film or whatever. It's fiction for Pete's sake and it's a good story!! It was told from the viewpoint of a survivor, someone who came back to Sparta and told the story. Of course there will be embellishments!<br>  <br>  Ah, but it wasn't just a good story, it was just a spectacular feast for the eyes in many respects and was very inspiring. It was a story about duty and loyalty, courage and honor. Who doesn't like that?<br>  <br>  No question, 300 is the best movie of 2007 so far. I've seen several: WILD HOGS, 23, GHOST RIDER, CATCH & RELEASE, MUSIC & LYRICS, DEAD SILENCE.... um, some other horror flick whose name I can't even remember now... in fact, several movies that I can't name now because they were so mundane but 300 is awesome! I'll buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out.

t74KHpcsaa	This is perhaps the best question I've ever seen on here. <br>  I'll bet Preemo is somewhat selective with who he wants to hook up. <br>  I don't think its a money issue and in some cases, as least I know with Jay, it was the artist. Jay-Z has said that he prefers to try to put together albums that give him the chance to give others shine. <br>  I also think loyalty plays a part....on the artist side.|`|qCr1dNspaa	I think it may have been a discredit to the rapper.  Especially the elite people named like NaS, and Biggie; I don't think an album with one general sound would allow their creative juices to flow as cliche as that may sound.  It's nice to have variety in beats, especially when dealing with hip hop icons...you want to hear them stretch their talent as much as possible....having one producer on an album may limit that.|`|6xRbnCISaa	one of the illest producer alive. Probably emcees never wanted a full length primo's album. Dont forget Primo produced some of the hottest beats for Afu-Ra.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I think Premo only hooks it up with full albums for members of the Gang Starr Foundation...<br>  He was probably too busy working with some of his other projects to make a full length album for NaS and Jay-Z...|`|6fxr3VBGaa	I doubt the artist wanted to do the whole album thing. A lot of them already have other guys giving them good beats. And a whole album of all Premo on a really mainstream artist might get boring. His beats are good when he throws out one or two for a album. But the whole thing, like you said, would have been a lack of variety.<br>  <br>  Edit: Some times artist even reject Premo's beats. I'm pretty sure I read an article where Premo said he did a beat for both Nas and Jay-Z recently and they both didn't even use the beat. But, I think we might see Nas(or someone else) and Premo hook up before long.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	That's a damn good question. Could have been exclusivity rights (his contract with Gang Starr's record company). Imagine Premo producing a full album by Biggie...........that would have been utterly disgusting.

Seconda metà del XIX sec. Il nuovissimo continente è meta di cercatori d'oro a ancora colonia penale inglese. Georgie vive assieme alla sua famiglia nei dintorni di Sidney. Durante una corsa a cavallo, Georgie conosce Lowell, il nipote del Governatore. I due si rivedono pochi giorni dopo, in occasione di una gara di boomerang cui la giovane partecipa, travestita da ragazzo, con il nome di Joe Buttman. Ma al momento di ritirare il premio, consistente in uno attrezzo agricolo per spannocchiare ed un bacio dall'altezzosa Elise, fidanzata di Lowell, Georgie rivela la sua identità. Il Governatore, in collera per essere stato preso in giro (la gara era aperta solo agli uomini), cambia presto idea e assegna ugualmente il premio alla ragazza. Sarà però Lowell a dare il bacio alla vincitrice, un bacio che Georgie non potrà dimenticare tanto facilmente e che cambierà le vite dei tre fratelli per sempre.<br>  <br>  In una notte piovosa la signora Buttman, madre adottiva di Georgie scorge la ragazza insieme a Lowell in giardino, venendo così a conoscenza della loro relazione. Al ritorno della ragazza nasce una furiosa discussione tra madre e figlia e la donna, fuori di sé dall'ira l'accusa di essere una sgualdrina rivelandole di averla accolta in casa solo per volere dei suoi familiari, lei che in realtà è la figlia di un deportato. Georgie, sconvolta, fugge e cade in un fiume in piena. Sarà provvidenziale l'intervento di Arthur per strapparla da una morte sicura. Il giorno dopo la giovane riceve la visita di Abel che le confessa di amarla da sempre. Improvvisamente il mondo sembra cadere addosso a Georgie: non può più tornare a casa e non più nemmeno più considerare Abel ed Arthur suoi fratelli, soprattutto adesso che sa cosa provano per lei. L'unica soluzione è partire per l'Inghilterra, ritrovare Lowell, già partito con lo scopo di rompere il suo fidanzamento con Elise e cercare le sue origini. Travestita da ragazzo, Georgie ottiene grazie a Jessica un imbarco come mozzo. Quest'ultima però ha un piano ben preciso: un uomo di sua fiducia dovrà uccidere la ragazza, così il cuore di Abel sarà per sempre suo.<br>  <br>  Giorni dopo anche Abel decide di imbarcarsi per raggiungerla mentre Athur decide di rimanere accanto alla madre, che muore di lì a poco per un attacco cardiaco. Sulla nave Georgie subisce una serie di attentati alla sua vita architettati dall'uomo ingaggiato da Jessica. Sfortunatamente il dottor Skiffins, un passeggero della stessa nave stranamente a conoscenza delle vere origini di Georgie, cade vittima di uno di questi attentati poco prima di rivelare alla ragazza ciò che sa. Grazie all'amicizia stretta con la piccola Catherine, Georgie, rivelatasi come donna, trova ospitalità a Londra presso la famiglia Barnes, e si prepara ad incontrare Lowell che nel frattempo è costretto a letto da una brutta tosse. I due riescono a ritrovarsi ma la loro serenità è presto offuscata da una violenta lite tra i genitori di lui, a cui i due ragazzi assistono non visti. Emerge così la triste situazione in cui vive il giovane: odiato e disprezzato dal padre, che non lo crede suo figlio; ignorato da una madre troppo occupata a fare vita mondana, Lowell è cresciuto dalla nonna e si rivela un ragazzo estremamente solo. Nel frattempo anche la nave su cui era imbarcato Abel giunge in Inghilterra ed il giovane si mette immediatamente alla ricerca di Georgie aiutato da un simpatico pappagallo che ripete in continuazione il nome della ragazza. Proprio grazie al "pennuto" i due riescono a ritrovarsi ma inutili sono le parole del ragazzo, che tenta in tutti i modi di convincere la "sorella" ad andare via con lui: Georgie ha fiducia in Lowell e lo ama anche se ancora non è riuscito a rompere il fidanzamento con Elise. A casa Barnes una sorpresa aspetta i due ragazzi: il duca Dangering è venuto a chiedere ai Barnes di organizzare il matrimonio fra Lowell e la nipote (Elise). Solo il provvidenziale aiuto di Lowell mette fine a una discussione a dir poco accesa.<br>  <br>  Deciso a ufficializzare la propria relazione con Georgie, Lowell prende parte al gran ballo organizzato dalla regina Vittoria portando con sé la ragazza. Ma il duca Dangering ha già in mente un piano per ostacolare i due ragazzi: usando per i propri scopi la Regina, ufficializza il fidanzamento tra Elise e il giovane. Nel frattempo nella sala da ballo Georgie subisce continui scherni da parte della nipote del duca e di un gruppo di sue amiche. A toglierla dall'imbarazzo interviene uno strano ragazzo, Cain. Georgie è sconcertata: questi è il ritratto vivente di suo fratello Arthur, lasciato in Australia, o almeno così lei crede,. Improvvisamente Lowell fa ritorno nella sala da ballo: apparentemente piegatosi ai voleri di Dangering e della Regina, in realtà medita di fuggire assieme a Georgie il più lontano possibile da Londra, anche se le sue condizioni di salute vanno notevolmente peggiorando. Il piano viene comunque messo in atto e i due si allontanano dalla capitale e si rifugiano in uno squallido e malsano paese di provincia. Georgie inizia così la sua nuova vita insieme al ragazzo che ama ma i problemi non tardano ad arrivare, primo fra tutti il progredire della malattia di Lowell, aggravata dall'umidità e dalle pessime condizioni economiche in cui i due si trovano a vivere. Per ovviare in parte ai problemi finanziari, Georgie decide di vendere il suo braccialetto (unica traccia del suo passato), rinunciando così alla speranza di poter, un giorno, riabbracciare il padre. In seguito ad una crisi particolarmente violenta di Lowell il dottore comunica alla ragazza che, se non adeguatamente curato a Londra da specialisti, Lowell morirà molto presto. Georgie non ha scelta: deve rinunciare a Lowell e lasciarlo alle cure di Elise. <br>  <br>  Tornata a Londra in preda allo sconforto, la ragazza ritrova Abel che la informa sulla sorte di Arthur: il giovane durante la traversata per raggiungere anch'egli Londra aveva scoperto un complotto ai danni della regina Vittoria organizzato dal duca Dangering, ed era stato rapito perché non parlasse . Drogato e seviziato da Arwin, il perverso figlio del duca , Arthur trascorre i suoi giorni in un vero e proprio inferno. Mentre Abel e Georgie pensano a come liberare il fratello prigioniero, casualmente, durante una passeggiata, i due si imbattono nel conte Gerald, e così Georgie ha finalmente l'occasione di riabbracciare suo padre, venuto in possesso del suo bracciale da un gioielliere di fiducia. <br>  <br>  A questo punto il problema resta riabilitare il conte e aiutare Arthur, per questo Gerald, Georgie ed Abel mettono in atto un piano per liberarlo, riuscendo rocambolescamente a sostituire al ragazzo il fratello e a fuggire via. Nel frattempo, Arwin si accorge dello scambio e Abel dopo aver ingaggiato con lui una lotta lo uccide suo malgrado. Nei pressi del Tamigi, Arthur riprende conoscenza , e in preda ad una crisi di astinenza di getta nel fiume per suicidarsi. Abel intanto viene condannato a morte per l'omicidio di Arwin, ma Gerogie riesce ad entrare nel carcere e i due finiscono "insieme": finalmente anche lei ha capito di amarlo e per i due potrebbe profilarsi la tanto agognata felicità visto che il conte Gerald ed altri amici sperano di poter dimostrare la colpevolezza di Dangering e quindi salvare la vita del giovane prima che la sentenza venga eseguita. Le cose, però, non vanno come previsto e il giorno seguente Abel muore per mano del duca, non prima però di aver raccontato tutta la verità sul complotto ai danni della regina. Il perfido duca è smascherato e condannato per i suoi crimini , ma niente e nessuno potrà ridare Abel ed Arthur a Georgie. Passano i mesi e e la ragazza da alla luce in figlio di Abel che viene battezzato con il nome di suo padre, Abel Junior. La ragazza torna in Australia dove l'aspetta una grande sorpresa: Arthur, scampato alla morte nelle gelide acque del Tamigi è guarito dalla droga grazie anche all'aiuto del vecchio zio Kevin.|`|BQRMLaWYaa	Credo che georgie alla fine si sposi con abel ma non ne sono sicura ma le tue supposizioni mi stanno sconvolgendo..|`|CqMjExMMaa	se ci si basa sul cartone trasmesso in tv georgie torna in australia con entrambi i fratelli,se vuoi il finale del fumetto georgi rimane incinta di abel ma abel muore,torna in australia e li trova arthur che credeva morto e si sposa con lui.|`|UJFPKOvKaa	alla fine giorgie ritorna in australia con i due fratelli rifiutando a malincuore l'amore di Lowell...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	ma scusa abel non parte e diventa un marinaio???|`|31oQhjsqaa	Allora:Abel passa la notte di passione con georgie, poi viene giustiziato perchè ha ucciso il conte.<br>  Arthur e Georgie tornano in australia dove continuano a vivere come fratelli (!) allevando il figlio che lei ha avuto da Abel.

lkNJNnlSaa	It is a good film.<br>  <br>  You're just jealous because you suck and have no awards|`|AA11569882	It doesn't look that good to me either, but I haven't seen it.  I guess it came out right before the people voted (I don't kow who votes for the oscars and that, but they must have seen it) and it was fresh in their minds.  I don't know...|`|HGdDjjULaa	well it sucked because... <br>  a) you have a closed mind<br>  b) are a horrible critic<br>  <br>  that movie displays a culture that many americans aren't aware of.<br>  it deserved every award it recieved.|`|1OJNgIVyaa	It does seem a bit overrated and I've never seen it. But from what other people have said it made you go through every emotion possible and it was a good movie and it was made to be realistic as that is how people are treated. From reviews ir did seem like the right movie to win and probably deserved it. It was very popular and its different to other movies that are being released at the moment.|`|82A8E4yzaa	It was alright....not like AMAZING....it was nice to see a film about happiness...instead of killings etc..like all the rest are about.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lets face it....there was no other films equal or better than it these days....all crap!|`|yauOABy3aa	sucked????? lol ur funny............not...........it was so good...........i loved it........|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Well, I didn't see the movie but I can tell you as a Danny Boyle fan, Slumdog Millionaire deserved to win.

PeuFnqQwaa	The odds of you getting into a record company office and playing for them in next to nil (not likely gonna happen). You can record a demo CD and send it to them (via courier, so that someone signs for it and at the very least you know they received it). A lot of bands get "discovered" by record company people that just happen to be in the audience at a live show. Your odds are way better with a smaller indie label, rather than one of the large ones. You want to get to know (they call it networking) as many people in the music industry as you can. Some of them may know people that can be beneficial to you. If they take a likeing to you, they may be able to help you out. The most important thing though is to Practice, Practice, Practice so that you are "as good" or better than the rest. A unique sound can also help you. You want to be different and stand out from the crowd. You don't want to sound like those other 20 artists or bands. If you do all of this and have lots of luck on your side... we may just see you on the charts in the future. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Also, try and develop a reputation as being dependable. Do not get a big head on and act like a spoiled brat. This is a turn off to everyone. You want to gain peoples respect. Threat them they way you would want to be treated yourself. Labels like artists that are reliable and low maintenance. Be open and willing to listen and learn... Do not be stubborn and narrow minded. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am sure there are other experienced people out there that can offer you some sound advice as well. You also must be able to develop the skills to be able to determine what is good advice and what is not so good.  Hope it works out for you. Remeber....Practice, Practice, Practice.... This is important.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Long ago , you could do that. go to a label's office manger and you could sing to them right there. But not anymore. They don't even accept ( unsolicited )  music they did not ask you for. It is very hard. There are a thousand singers on music row in Nashville all trying to get a deal. That's how it's been since the 50's. Try to get into the open mike cafes they have over there. If you are unique and different from the rest, you may have a chance. I in a 1000, but a chance. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to buy a copy of "Songwriter's Market" and send them original stuff . Don't send them any covers, but original material you or somebody wrote for you. You can also try to call the independent labels and request if you can send them a copy of your singing. Be unique . don't try to sound like the famous artists. Be yourself. That's what they look for.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	it depends sometimes it starts off slow n hard n sometimes fast easy slow n hard u gotta start from basics like put yo self out there like myspace or some local radio or internet site just record yoself also connections from people are good. but hen some people get recognized doing musicals plays or just singing in the church choir but mostly u can get one if u find a agent or somebody GOTTA HAVE CONNECTIONS|`|g12oBzpUaa	Call me

Wo40MwrEaa	I've loved KH for a good 7 years or so.  Seen them live many many times and now know them well enough to keep in touch and get on the guestlist for shows so yes, of course I know them!<br>  My favorite songs are old school ones, like The Trains Are So Loud, Hummingbirds the Size of Bullets, Welcome to Chicago, Motherf***er.  Some that were on major label that I love are Kennedy, Lips Like Morphine and They Can't Save Us Now.<br>  If you like Mat's voice, check out some Silversun Pickups and let me know what you think.|`|5fhlVgoMaa	i've heard of em. dont really listen to em that much|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I have known of them for a while being that they come from Chicago.  Best songs by them are Kennedy and the aforementioned Lips Like Morphine.  Sadly, I was somewhat disappointed with the new album, as the rest of it wasn't nearly as good as either of those two songs.|`|hN67hH8saa	i know them too.

Va al cesso a defecare e poi, orgoglioso della propria creazione lascia una scritta per i posteri: "In questo posto che di me.rda è asilo, ho fatto uno str.onzo di almeno un chilo. Dante Alighieri". Dopo un po' anche Petrarca sente il bisogno d'assentarsi. Giunto al luogo ameno legge la frase del collega e, punto nell'orgoglio, si sforza il più possibile per essere in grado anch'egli di lasciare ai posteri un verso degno della propria grandezza: "Per non essere di meno alle rime tue, ho fatto uno str.onzo che ne pesa due! Petrarca". Passa un po' di tempo ed anche Boccaccio sente un certo stimolo. Giunto ai servizi legge i versi dei propri compari ed impallidisce. Possibile? Si mette d'impegno ma per quanto si sforzi non riesce a produrre più che qualche stronzetto. Si decide comunque a lasciare anch'egli il proprio contributo letterario: "Per fare str.onzi di sì tale peso, bisogna per lo meno aver il c.ulo offeso.

4y4JRhDyaa	emo è la pronuncia italiana, ma in realtà si pronuncia imo, o come dici tu imoh..da quel che ne so io, non intendendomene molto (ma basta guardarsi in giro o dare un'occhiata alle foto su internet) gli emo si vestono o di nero (che fa molto punk -.-' ) oppure esagerando coi colori, che so, rosa fucsia e robe varie..e non mancano mai le stelle, le righe o gli scacchi, in genere bianco/neri, neri/fucsia o neri/rossi..poi cinture con le borchie ecc..e non mancano i capelli di lato, conl ciuffo che copre un occhio, quello è pressochè obbligatorio..la musica caratteristica è il punk rock, che loro spesso prendono come punk vero e proprio..insomma, alla fin fine non si tratta altro che di una moda, il provare piacere a sentirsi un pò ribelli e andare in giro tirandosela..i poser sono proprio loro, quelli che fanno i punk, ma che non lo sono..quelli che vogliono far parte a tutti i costi di qualcosa a cui non appartengono e spesso si sanno pure conciare bene, che viene quasi il dubbio che lo siano sul serio..ma come ho letto in una risposta recente, il vero movimento emo è ormai morto..poi non si spiega il fatto che ora le ccittà son piene di ragazze/i tutti uguali, se non col fatto che è una moda appunto..per fortuna almeno il metal non diventerà mai oggetto di moda..(spero..!!) ciao! spero di essere stata chiara..e che non mi mettano il pollice verso, perchè alla fin fine non ho detto niente di sbagliato..<br>  <br>  elly: ecco, in altre parole esattamente così..infatti in giro si vede tanta e tanta di quella gente che se ne è andata dal parrucchiere o a prendersi la felpa con le stelle..che quindi lo è "diventata" da un giorno all'altro..moda!! moda, dannata moda, nient'altro..emo=emotive, confermo, e infatti non mi sembrano molto tristi o emotivi sti ragazzi/e che girano per strada, no? io sono spesso triste e malinconica, e mi sono pure tagliata più di una volta..ma non per questo ci tengo particolarmente a farmi definire emo, proprio perchè potrei pure non essere presa sul serio, con tutti questi falsi emo in giro..non ci tengo proprio a farmi definire..oh insomma..sta moda..uff -.-'|`|HtLWCbFFaa	che io sappia si scrive emo e si pronuncia imoh e poi si vestono stretti tipo punk d solito con colori scuri....questo e tutto quello che so|`|Acdwd3vIaa	so k i poser fanno parte di tutte le sottoculture musicali dal punk al metal, e sono chiamato così con un certo disprezzo, negativamente..poi, visto che gli emo derivano dal punk, penso possano essere considerati dei poser, non è mia intenzione offendere nessuno, non sono una emo,dico solo qll k so..|`|lfojTcInaa	?Con il termine emo si contraddistingue un sottogenere della musica hardcore punk. Nella sua interpretazione originale, il termine emo fu utilizzato per descrivere la musica di Washington DC della metà degli anni '80 e le band associate ad essa. Negli anni successivi, fu coniato il termine emocore (abbreviazione di “emotional hardcore"), usato per descrivere altre scene musicali influenzate da quella di Washington. Il termine emo deriva dalla volontà della band di "emozionare" l'ascoltatore durante le proprie esibizioni|`|v6a74uOGaa	allora....in poche parole.......gli emo [SI SCRIVE COSì MA SI LEGGE IMOH!] sono ragazzi/e che sanno far emergere sentimenti che molte persone trovano banali o insulsi (specialmente per ragazzi)da questo emo, ke deriva si da un genere musicale degli anni 80 ecc, ma deriva anke da emo.tional....emo è uno stile di vita, quindi non si può diventare emo da un giorno all'altro, almeno x i vestiti logico ke si cambia, x forza, ma nell"anima" devi essere tipo sensibile...nn puoi essere uno spaccone x prend x il **** la gente!!<br>  RIASSUMENDO<br>  emoboy = emotional boy....non è una moda...ma piu che altro una condizione/stile...gli emo boy sono generalmente ragazzi che esternano senza problemi le proprie emozioni...sono molto sensibili e molto spesso..erroneamente, si pensa che il sentimento dominante in loro sia la tristezza, oppure che si tagliano o amano farsi el male!!poi naturalmente c'è anke un modo di vestire ma qll nn ke serva a tanto, infatto i POSER sn qll xsone ke si vestono da emo ma dentro nn lo sono....<br>  e bisogna ricordare ke il modo di vestire è simile ai punk xk l'emo è una "sottocartella" del punk...<br>  poi il ciuffo sull'okkio xk si dice ke gli emo asciughino le lacrime con il loro ciuffo!!*-* nn è beeeeelo???vaben dai..spero di essere stata kiara...ciao!!!^^

i0cJK7Zpaa	When the anime was first produced, it was heavily edited for TV, but the DVD was sold with all the gore, language, and sexual content.  Although Gantz is banned in my house, I can find no news reports of it being banned anywhere else.

Among the books seized was Death Note, which appeared on China's national TV last week".|`|bXGr0JZyaa	no.|`|zBFehZHbaa	NO.......<br>  Because the author is lazy, it is published in the magazine only twice a month.
I6nopGJJaa	Oye socio perdona pero estaba fuera del aire (de onda) acabo de entrar aYR:  Aqui esta:<br>  Una pompa de jabón es una película muy fina de jabón y agua que encierra a una esfera hueca y exhibe una superficie iridiscente. Normalmente las pompas de jabón duran solo unos momentos y luego estallan por sí solas o por contacto con otro objeto. A menudo se usan como objeto de juego para los ni?os, pero su uso en espectáculos artísticos demuestra que también pueden ser fascinantes para los adultos. Las pompas de jabón pueden ayudar a resolver problemas matemáticos complejos sobre el espacio, ya que siempre buscan la menor área de superficie entre puntos o aristas.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte!

Every rap artist does...|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	hahahahahahahahahahaha!!! <br>  <br>  okokok a 'shortie' just means that a girl is your 'short time' girlfriend, who is aware that you have another girlfriend and doesnt care. so kind of like a friend with benefits. <br>  <br>  hope this answers your question lol|`|OsejQXvoaa	Ummm don't use that.

She spoke Italian and I speak English. We weren't really together for the conversation though.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I would.  We could teach each other so much.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Yes; it might be interesting.|`|d8yrvK4waa	If she was hot - Yes<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|Hw3n0nenaa	I dated a deaf mute . It was a blast for about 2 weeks.|`|58KUMpF0aa	This is actually interesting.  The answer I will give is:  I would be perhaps willing to date someone who did not speak my language if her body talk gave the game away as to what she wanted.  There are unanimous ways of saying "Yes" and a mere nodding of the head will determine a "Yes" answer.  However, I would probably want her to make the first move if she spoke only a language I didn't speak because I am not great at first moves anyway.  <br>  <br>  My humor side comment to my answer is:  if the ONLY problem between her and I is the language, that would be more workable than the usual problems.|`|xggSASTwaa	no, how would you even know they wanted to date you? how do you say i love you? You have to be able to conversate with someone in order to have a connection. But you could teach them, and also have a translator, they have those online. It would be really difficult and time consuming though.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	If I couldn't speak whatever language they were speaking, no.<br>  <br>  That would be pointless.

whCa0MgHaa	i got backstage at a justin timberlake concert a couple years ago! go either right before the concert finishes or once a lot of people have cleared out of the arena. then go to the guy who is at the gate between the audience and the stage (sometimes there are a couple at each side so go for the friendlier looking one)! tell him that it would mean the world to you to go backstage, youre not going to go mental or take pictures (hide ur camera!), and you know its unlikely you will even see them, but you just want to experience it!...so theres no real harm in letting you go! goodluck!!! and dont forget to smile sweetly and be confident!   :)|`|2Q6Emf7Zaa	i would just try to charm your way in. and if the jonas brothers see you trying to get in they'll prob tell the security to let you. but just be like "oh please i just want to see them for a second and get an autograph. it'd really be so sweet of you to let me in." idk but good luckk! =]<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmG1tmoHHCz7koc6d6KWEtXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20070909100740AAM0qc7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

40bae8cc3f46c031da40c60273be4bf3aa	Alcatraz Musica Island, costruito su un’area di 3000mq, sorge<br>  a Milano, in Via Valtellina 25, in una posizione facilmente<br>  raggiungibile dai mezzi pubblici e dalle principali arterie autostradali.<br>  <br>  Officina meccanica prima e casa di spedizioni dopo, la struttura, che risale al 1946, viene completamente ristrutturata nel 1997/1998 trasformando l'immobile nel centro polifunzionale più eclettico e all'avanguardia di Milano.<br>  Nella ristrutturazione è stato rispettato il carattere architettonico dello spazio; la copertura, tenuta completamente a vista, è arricchita dagli imponenti canali dell'area condizionata e dagli impianti tecnologici. La conformazione della struttura e i suoi servizi accessori, permettono l’allestimento di configurazioni particolari offrendo la possibilità di personalizzare lo spazio in ogni sua area sia lavorando a terra che utilizzando tutte le possibilità di fly system, a costi assolutamente competitivi rispetto ad altre strutture.<br>  <br>  Grazie alla sua superficie, alla funzionalità e alla versatilità degli spazi, Alcatraz è diventato il punto di riferimento di un elevato numero di Aziende alla ricerca di una location per convention, feste private, attività e manifestazioni pubblicitarie, artistiche, culturali, discoteca, produzioni televisive, eventi sociali, commerciali, e qualsiasi altra iniziativa legata al mondo dello spettacolo, della moda e dello sport.<br>  <br>  Alcatraz è anche una location ideale per concerti live: in particolare, è l’unico locale in Europa che consente ai TIR di produzione di avere accesso diretto al palco dall’enorme portone centrale.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	ci sono stata solo una volta e non ero molto in me...avevo bevuto....cmq :é un bel posto..|`|34K2ppRtaa	ci sono stata qualche volta per diversi concerti, il posto non è male..non grandissimo ma dovrebbe andare bene come spazio, l'unica cosa che lasciava un pò a desiderare era l'acustica (almeno ai concerti dove sono stata io) che non era delle migliori. puoi stare tra la folla sotto il palco altrimenti cè una specie di "balconata" ai lati (anche se io preferisco sotto al palco =D) e cè anche il bar

QUE VIVA LA RUMBA PA′GOZA jejeje|`|0f8432aa1981fd10740482a5828a0516aa	No, todo es posible cuando hay voluntad de hacerlo y de organizarlo, depende quien acepte.|`|ad468e926a964287b7e4bb3bd67a3b67aa	bella idea|`|b608bf163b3422255aa43f7ce76b4d83aa	?Vale! ?Paga Yahoo? Porque yo de momento no sé si tengo dinero ni para ir a Calatayud.<br>  <br>  Además, ya podía ser grande el bar (que iba a hacer su agosto), porque si no, irremediablemente exiliados en la calle, íbamos a parecer una manifestación (y entonces surgiría un problema: ?cuál sería el lema de la manifestación? Ahí se liarían otra vez a discutir los más guerreros de la sección "política" y, como no tendrían la barrera de la distancia, se liarían a hostias y el hospital no daría abasto).<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, creo que haría muchas sorpresas. Descubriríamos que tras muchos avatares de mujer (e incluso de mujeres exhuberantísimas) se esconde un se?or septuagenario gordito y calvo muy poco femenino. O que Miss Lucy no existe, y es en realidad un adolescente freak adicto a los juegos de rol y con la mente un poco p'allá. Me gustaría también ver cómo se presentaba un usuario italiano que vi una vez, llamado "El Toll que vende lavadoras", y obsesionado con colocarnos a buen precio una Whirpooll de stock que, parece ser, no vendía ni a la de tres. Y ?cómo se las arreglarían para dar la cara los que tienen varias cuentas a la vez?<br>  <br>  Luego, estoy segura de que muchos "amigos" dejarían de serlo porque se caerían mal, muchos enemigos se harían amigos porque encontrarían que se entienden genial y surgiría un nuevo sistema posiblemente distinto de filias y fobias basado en el "feeling". <br>  <br>  Otros no: aprovecharían para tirarse los trastos a la cabeza como siempre habían deseado, o darían rienda suelta a su hasta entonces amor platónico (aunque en esto soy más escéptica).<br>  <br>  Posiblemente la mayoría serían menos radicales (ya se sabe: Internet es el medio por el que mucha gente que en su vida normal es bastante tranquilita por convenicencia da rienda suelta a toda su agresividad) y no habría tanta pelea sino más paz pero, eso sí, mucha más hipocresía y "bienquedar".<br>  <br>  Y habría grupos de amigos que se descubrirían hiper-heterogéneos: una se?ora de setenta y tres a?os descubriría que había estado respondiéndose y preguntándose con un crío de dieciséis, una de treinta y otro de ciento cinco a?os... y volvería a aparecer el imperativo social por el cual estos grupos son inverosímiles y no es posible la amistad tan condenadamente heterogénea. Dicha se?ora empezaría a comportarse como la abuela adoptiva del adolescente y dejaría de tener en cuenta sus ideas como persona adulta, y el adolescente empezaría a comportarse como nieto... Reaparecerían todos los tópicos sociales, habría menos libertad. Por no hablar de los sordomudos, que sé verían incapaces de hacerse entender por el resto. O los que llevan la pierna escayolada, que tendrían que pedir ayuda todo el tiempo y no tendrían sitio para las firmas.<br>  <br>  En fin, yo creo que, además de imposible, sería más un desastre que otra cosa. En todo caso, si lo hacéis, yo me pido un zumo de melocotón.|`|e7c81a9a9b0f7ee363ebf4c1a66cff97aa	muy dificl sobre todo  por el viaje y los gastos pero muy buena idea como para formar comunidades virtuales o reales  y hacer algo para la socieda o nuestro mundo campa?as anticontaminacion y esas cosas ya sabes pero siento que es como un sue?o ojala lo tomaramos en cuenta no crees?|`|12bd6d90dbde8055bbcd30c06cf430c7aa	seria bueno ehh si se podria pro tanbien depende pro bueno ay que vivir la vida lokaa!!

u7DuYEojaa	vegekou è stato ottenuto grazie ai poteri magici dei potara, gli orecchini del sommo kaio shin, che hanno permesso la fusione istantaneae permanente; mentre gogeta è il risultato della tecnica della fusione, cioè attraverso quel balletto che hanno fatto anche goten e trunks!|`|NllOyO3Haa	vegekou/vegeth/vegetto è la fusione con gli orecchini potara,gogeta è la fusione con il balletto...|`|7LlaFzLyaa	Nelle varie trasposizioni , cartone animato , manga , anime , traduzioni ecc ... molti nomi vengono cambiati .|`|5BtHmUnxaa	qst fusione si kiama vegekuo...è giusto|`|5oO2SXdhaa	la fusione cn gli orekkini e' vegekuo mentre quella ke faranno fra un po di puntate,cioe' cn il balletto,e'gogeta.ok?|`|756fafdb6431c58e47efa842e851db15aa	no diventa vegegou qnd diventano supersajan|`|qBelF14laa	Vegeth è la fusione tra Goku e Vegeta eseguita con gli orecchini Potara, Gogeta è la fusione tra loro eseguita con il balletto|`|2S4qt3Bkaa	Anke io ci avevo pensato !!!

Questa fusione fatta con orecchini si chiamma vegekou|`|KOCpUKMXaa	gogeta è la fuzione di goku e vegeta di 4 livello invece vegekuo è formato da goku e vegeta normali|`|RCw6zQGXaa	se fanno il balletto vuol dire che non hanno orecchini e quindi diventa gogeta se lo fanno con l'orrecchino diventa vegekuo solo che se fanno il balletto cioè (gogeta) hanno un limite di tempo come e successo a trunks e goten mentre se lo fanno con l'orrechino che sarebbe il potara non hanno un limite di tempo solo che dopo non si possono stacchars conme e successo a vecchio kaioshn .|`|RfO8pHNtaa	gogeta è quella con il balletto, vegekuo con i potara|`|SUI6H0Tlaa	Gogeta è la fusione che Goku e Vegeta effettuano facendo il balletto (lo stesso che fanno Goten e Trunks per diventare Gotenks), ma in questa forma non appare mai nella serie, solo negli OAV (senza considerare Dragon Ball GT credo... ma come si fa a considerare quello scempio?!).<br>  La fusione che vedi ora in TV si chiama Vegeth o Vegetto (ma la Mediaset ha ben pensato di ribattezzarlo Vegeku per motivi sconosciuti... non mi pareva difficile VEGETH, fra l'altro era la fusione dei nomi Vegeta e Kakaroth quindi non era neanche tanto astruso... vabbeh!) "dovrebbe" essere irreversibile (dovrebbe perché poi vedrai che non sarà così!) ed è quella che si effettua con gli orecchini Potara (la stessa fusione che hanno fatto Kaioshin e Kibith, e quella sì che è permanente!)<br>  <br>  Comunque tra i due Gogeta è indubbiamente il più forte! Ciao!|`|cuM08lYlaa	Vegekou<br>  E' il risultato della fusione tra Vegeta e Goku tramite i Potara. Da notare l'aspetto la pettinatura di Vegeth è composta dai capelli di Vegeta ed i ciuffetti davanti come Goku, gli abiti chiaramente un misto tra i due originali.  <br>  <br>  Gogeta<br>  Gogeta è il risultato del primo tipo di fusione( Balletto) tra Goku e Vegeta, e per il poco tempo che appare si può subito capire che la sua potenza è molto superiore a quella di Vegekou.|`|qisw1sgYaa	sono d'accordo con Marron!

LgyHDlCwaa	Senti questa che carina...<br>   <br>  Quattro amici si ritrovano dopo tanti anni.<br>  Iniziano a parlare del più e del meno e, mentre uno va a ordinare da<br>  bere, gli altri cominciano a parlare dei propri figli.<br>   <br>  Il primo dei tre dice:<br>  "Sono molto orgoglioso di mio figlio.<br>  Ha iniziato a lavorare come fattorino, si è iscritto alle serali e si<br>  è diplomato. Dopo pochi anni è diventato direttore ed oggi è il<br>  presidente della compagnia. E' diventato cosi ricco da regalare a un<br>  suo amico che compiva gli anni una<br>  Mercedes superlusso".<br>   <br>  Al che il secondo dice:<br>  "Anche io sono molto orgoglioso di mio figlio.<br>  Ha cominciato a lavorare come steward a bordo di un aereo. Nel<br>  frattempo è diventato pilota. Si è associato con altri e ha fondato<br>  una compagnia aerea. Oggi è così ricco che lui a un amico per il<br>  compleanno ha regalato un aereo bi motore Cessna.<br>   <br>  Il terzo allora racconta:<br>  "Non posso dirvi l'orgoglio che mi dà il mio.<br>  Ha studiato ingegneria.<br>  Ha aperto un'impresa di costruzioni e ha fatto i miliardi. Lui, per<br>  il compleanno di un amico, gli ha regalato una villa da 1500 mq".<br>   <br>  Nel frattempo il quarto torna e chiede di cosa stessero parlando. Lo<br>  informano e gli chiedono di suo figlio. "Mio figlio è un gigolò per<br>  gay. Si guadagna da vivere così". E gli amici: "Poverino, che<br>  disgrazia!" "Ma quale disgrazia, sta una favola!<br>  Pensate che quest'anno per il suo compleanno tre frocioni di clienti gli<br>  hanno regalato<br>  una Mercedes, un aereo privato e una villa di 1500 mq.!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  bella vero????????????<br>  ah ah ah|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	non so se ti piacerà...<br>  Estate. Due amici si incontrano. “Che ci fai in città ad agosto?”, “Mia moglie è in vacanza coi figli e mi ha lasciato a casa a lavorare e senza un euro!” “Allora stasera si va a cena al ristorante e poi tutta vita!” “Ma se t’ho detto che non ho un euro!” “Non ti preoccupare! Ho un sistema infallibile per non pagare il conto. Vieni con me” e entrano in un negozio di alimentari dove comprano un wurstel “Ecco quando siamo alla fine della cena io mi metto questo davanti, tu lo prendi in bocca e fingi di farmi un bo..cch..in.o. Vedrai che ci cacciano in men che non si dica senza nemmeno farci pagare!” . Vanno nel miglior ristorante della città, mangiano di tutto e bevono di più; al momento di chiedere il conto il primo estrae il wurstel mettendolo all’altezza dell’inguine e l’altro lo su..cchi..a; alle rimostranze degli altri clienti il direttore li fa cacciare in malo modo, scaraventandoli sul marciapiede. Ma i due sono entusiasti della riuscita al punto che decidono di fare il giro di tutti i migliori locali, adottando sempre il metodo del wurstel. A notte fonda i due, ubriachi e distrutti, sono seduti sul marciapiede dell’ennesimo ristorante. “Io non ce la faccio più… Ho bevuto troppo e poi mi fa male la mascella a forza di succhiare quel wurstel!” “E io che dovrei dire, allora, che il wurstel l’ho perso quando ci hanno buttato fuori dal primo ristorante?”.|`|XudTKBdzaa	Un paziente va dal medico per sapere i risultati delle analisi, il medico gli fa: "Si accomodi e si rilassi, che le devo dare due notizie di cui una è proprio brutta!" <br>  Non mi faccia impaurire dottore che cosa è successo?

Da' una grossa somma a un gruppo di matematici che si mettono a lavorare al progetto. Dopo due mesi il capo ricercatore dice al miliardario: "Abbiamo finito e possiamo dire che la soluzione al problema esiste!".<br>  "E qual e'?" domanda il giocatore.<br>  "Noi siamo matematici e siamo solo in gradi di dirle che esiste".<br>  Il miliardario riflette e capisce che in fondo i matematici sono astratti e che doveva rivolgersi a qualcuno di piu' pratico, quindi chiama i fisici. Stessa solfa e dopo due mesi il risultato e': "I matematici hanno ragione - dice il capo dei fisici - la soluzione al problema esiste e noi l'abbiamo trovata, nell'ipotesi semplificativa che il cavallo sia una sfera!".<br>  Il miliardario capisce di aver sbagliato un'altra volta e pensa di rivolgersi a qualcuno ancora piu' pratico: gli ingegneri. Versa per la terza volta la somma e, stavolta, va a controllare giorno dopo giorno i progressi del lavoro. Gli ingegneri non si applicano affatto: chi parla al telefono, che naviga in Internet, chi legge il giornale. Dopo due mesi comunque arriva il capo progettista e dice: "Domani lei vada alle Capannelle e punti alla prima corsa su Tizio vincente, nella seconda su Caio vincente,..." e cosi' via. Il giorno seguente il miliardario va a giocare e vince a tutte le corse. Organizza un party per celebrare la vittoria e a notte inoltrata prende da parte il capo ingegnere e gli chiede come avessero fatto. "Semplice, con tutti i soldi che ci ha dato abbiamo comprato tutti i fantini"<br>  <br>  <br>  Si dice: una morte stupida. Ma io devo ancora trovare uno che sia morto in modo intelligente.<br>  <br>  <br>  In sala operatoria.

Provandone compassione, tira fuori una banconota da 5 euro e la da' al pover'uomo. "Mi scusi, - dice il mendicante - mi tolga una curiosita' ... Sono vent'anni che lei mi fa l'elemosina ogni domenica e la ringrazio. Ma perche' vent'anni fa mi regalava 100.000 lire, poi dieci anni fa mi regalava 50.000 lire, 5 anni fa 20.000 e ora solo 5 euro? Invece di aumentare diminuisce?".<br>  "Caro mio ... Lei deve sapere che vent'anni fa ero single e avevo cosi' tanti soldi che non riuscivo neanche a spenderli. Poi dieci anni fa mi sono sposato e ho dovuto limitare le spese; cinque anni fa mi sono nati due gemelli e ho dovuto tirare la cinghia. E ora che i miei genitori sono malati devo proprio stare attento a ogni euro che spendo!".<br>  "E ... mi dica una cosa, - ribatte il mendicante - ma tutte queste persone proprio con i miei soldi le deve mantenere?".|`|rp45dxYSaa	eneamagno....hai proprio ragione.....ke senso ha adesso piangere o ridere se moriremo tutti........pensa noi nn lo sappiamo ma potremmo morire anke domani.......o dopodomani.......o dopo ankora................<br>  <br>  ....moriremo tutti........|`|yP3V2Zy6aa	Sorridere serve a poco, è slo 1 diversivo.<br>  Lascia ke i tuoi sentimenti si trasformino in odio, sfogati, aiutati kon la musika.<br>  "Quando il sistema ti kiude ogni spazio, nn rimane ke la musica x esprimere la tua rabbia!!!"<br>  Sopravvivi x te stessa.|`|048Cp1xQaa	Senti qst:<br>  Tra due spermatozoi, uno fa all'altro: - Allora, allora... manca molto per arrivare alle ovaie? - Direi di si... abbiamo appena superato le tonsille!!<br>  ehehehheee, l'ho trovata qui <a href="http://www.andreacatavolo.it/italiano/Barzellette/36a_settimana_agosto.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.andreacatavolo.it/italiano/Ba...</a>|`|Cobwzq6Daa	vai a vederti la pantera rosa...su sky....muori dal ridere....ihi<br>  dialogo tra l'ispettore Cluseau e un indagato che è il preparatore atletico di una squadra di calcio<br>  - Chi è le?<br>  - Sono Yuri<br>  - E Chi è lei Yuri?<br>  - Il preparatore! <br>  - E cosa fa Yuri il preparatore?<br>  - Preparo!<br>  - E quindi lei è Yuri il preparatore che prepara?<br>  - Si. <br>  - Non lasci l'Europa!<br>  - Ma devo andare in Asia... <br>  - Non lasci nè l'Europa nè l'Asia<br>  - Ah, abbiamo una partita in Brasile. <br>  - Uh, che noia...non lasci l'Europa, l'Asia e neanche le Americhe!<br>  buahuahuahua|`|rAnixQc0aa	nn essere triste anche se ti è successo qualcosa di brutto sorridi a tutto ciò che ti sta vicini goditi la vita al meglio e nn pensare alle cose brutte pensa positivo bacio

Il<br>  solo possedere alcool in Arabia Saudita è un<br>  crimine grave quindi, per<br>  l'ancor più terribile crimine del consumo di<br>  alcool, vengono condannati<br>  a morte. Tramite gli intrallazzi di Moggi e<br>  con l'aiuto di avvocati<br>  molto in gamba riescono a tramutare la sentenza<br>  di morte in prigione a<br>  vita.<br>  Fortuna vuole che il giorno in cui il processo finisce, in Arabia<br>  Saudita è festa nazionale e lo Sceicco essendo di buon umore decide che<br>  questi possono essere liberati e puniti con solo 20 frustate a testa.<br>  Mentre si preparano per la punizione, lo sceicco dice: - Oggi è il<br>  compleanno della mia prima moglie e lei mi ha chiesto di esaudire un<br>  desiderio ad ognuno di voi prima di farvi frustare. -<br>  Per primo tocca a<br>  Moggi che ci pensa un po' e dice: - Legatemi un<br>  cuscino sulla schiena!<br>  - Così viene fatto, purtroppo il cuscino dura solo 10 frustate e le altre 10 gli lacerano la schiena e così lo portarono via sanguinante e in agonia.Poi tocca a Zidane che, vista la scena, dice: - Legatemi 2 cuscini sulla schiena! - Ma i due cuscini durano solo per 15 frustate, le altre 5 gli lacerano la schiena e anche lui viene portato via<br>  sanguinante e piagnucolante come una bambina.<br>  E' ora il turno di Materazzi ma prima che questi possa dire qualcosa, lo sceicco dice: -<br>  Tu sei un campione del mondo e per questa ragione ti concederò ben due<br>  desideri. --- Grazie, Sua Altezza! - risponde Materazzi - In ammirazione della<br>  Vostra clemenza come primo desiderio voglio che mi siano date 100<br>  frustate invece di 20 ...<br>  - Non solo sei un campione, ma sei anche coraggioso! - esclamò lo<br>  Sceicco con ammirazione. - Ebbene se<br>  100 frustate sono il tuo desiderio<br>  così sarà fatto. Ora dimmi... qual è<br>  il tuo secondo desiderio? -<br>  - Legatemi Zidane sulla schiena .|`|64h4W3sTaa	ahahahah xdxdxd bellissima!!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	ma che scemo!il condannato intendo!|`|NMgVXlsyaa	SUPER..........M.........|`|bba81c75851ba04beadb07f741e165ebaa	Stellina meritata|`|0bc377e0145dfc6c123ffa6e1e24ded3aa	Ahahahah....simpaticissma.<br>  <br>  Mi è venuta in mente anche questa (a proposito di scemi!!!)<br>  In carcere. - Quanto hai beccato? - Tre settimane... - Tre settimane?

A quel punto il ladro accende la torcia elettrica e la punta verso la voce. Illumina un pappagallo sul suo trespolo. Fra l'incazzato e il sollevato gli chiede: " E tu chi cazzo sei!?".

hIugfwUvaa	Concordo con te nel non avere parole per la risposta di crazyavril..<br>  Maleducazione, ignoranza..bah..meno male che bisogna essere gentili su Yahoo answer..<br>  Come si fa ad insultare così una persona in nome di un idolo in cui si crede? ..no comment..forse bisognerebbe andare al di la dei paraocchi che ci limitano..<br>  Magari bisognerebbe maturare anche un po', perchè come hai detto tu si tratta di una persona ormai diciottenne (o che lo diventerà a breve) e non si può pretendere di muoversi nel mondo degli adulti continuando su questa strada.<br>  E infine concordo con te anche per quanto riguarda il video, però cosa ci possiamo fare?

2xGIJ3Dtaa	io ho cominciato che avevo 14 anni circa, cioe' quando ha pieno inizio quel periodo tremendo adolescenziale, in cui ti fai miliardi di domande, crisi esistenziali varie ecc.ecc. per cui avvertivo la necessità di un genere musucale impegnato, profondo, quale è proprio il rock.<br>  In generale non seguo fenomeni di massa e tutto cio' che è commerciale, perchè mi sembra che alcune persone siano totalmente passive e senza personalità, che seguono e fanno determinate cose "perchè le fanno tutti".<br>  Ora ho 19 anni, e sinceramente ogni tanto ho qualche ricaduta "pop", però sono pienamente cosciente di ascoltare musica non esattamente di elevata qualità.<br>  Alterno i vari generi.<br>  Ciao!|`|4e3dc7d58b4bf6203bc6154768344e65aa	Ciao,<br>  ho 37 anni..il mio genere è sempre rock...da quando sono piccola...<br>  pensa che il mio primo concerto è stato The queen a 9 anni...(con degli amici dei miei genitori,logicamente)<br>  Piu che rock pesante ho seguito la linea Dark soprattutto (the Cure, Bauhaus, Jesus and Mary Chains,the Sister of mercy...e altri..) un genere maliconico...ma così poetico , il quale  mi ha  assorbito tantissimo l'anima...passavo ore in camera o per la strada...ascoltandola.....e tutt'ora ho i brividi  quando risento certi suoni....certo tra il rock piu pesante(come lo chiami tu)...potrei dire che Metallica mi piacciono tanto..e forse non così pesante Faith no more..(che stò rivalorizzando in qusto periodo)<br>  Cosa provo quando ascolto?..ho molteplici sensazioni...tutto dipende anche dallo stato d'animo....ma da sempre trovo nel rock energia...<br>  Il commerciale..purtroppo mi sembra lineare e statico...<br>  comunque è soggettivo..ma i gusti sono gusti...e il mondo è bello perchè vario..anche in questo..|`|51f3a50fde2039c9543495df7006320eaa	ho cominciato ad ascoltare metal con i soulfly a 14 anni..grazie a mio padre..e questo genere ti regala emozioni ke nessun altro può fare..cmq anke io odio la pausini e la musica commerciale|`|64a794dd6eb4a64911d4587c17396723aa	perche il pop rilassa e concilia il rock carica e distrugge!!!|`|8eK8Lvu4aa	ho cominciato ad ascoltare rock pesante quando a 13-14 anni arrivò in casa mia Made in Japan dei Deep Purple...come tastierista rock rifiuto il commerciale xkè so benissimo ke il suo scopo nn è la musica ma i soldi...suonare un brano dei deep purple (ad esempio) è molto eccitante mentre suonare un brano commerciale mi annoia tantissimo...è una questione di 'difficoltà-facilità' dei pezzi ke mi fa selezionare cosa ascoltare e cosa non ascoltare. per 'difficoltà-facilità' nn intendo solo l'esecuzione tecnica dei pezzi, ma anke l'anima cn cui i musicisti nn commerciale esprimono se stessi.|`|CYizW4wpaa	io ascolto rock sin da piccola...piccola intendo sui 5 anni..all'inizio non per scelta..avendo un fratello più grande di 9 anni...era lui che aveva il predominio sullo stereo...quindi mi adeguavo..verso i 7 anni questo genere mi ha preso un sacco,cioè,proprio me lo sentivo dentro...mi piaceva...non avevo cassette e successivamente cd miei ma ascoltavo tutta la roba del mio fratellone che andava 24 ore su 24 dato che studiava con la musica....crescendo,e quando lui ha iniziato ad usare la macchina andavamo in giro per la città con i finestrini abbassati e lo stereo al max ascoltando rock a go go...i mitici rolling stones i pink floyd per poi andare sui metallica,i blink,i linkin ecc...<br>  diciamo che la mia passione è iniziata da piccina e grazie a mio fratello...<br>  ora però non posso dire di avere un vero e proprio genere..sto sperimentando un pò di tutto..soprattutto emo di recente ma considero il rock come la vera musica<br>  bacioni|`|WjBl4Hpuaa	Dunque...ho cominciato ad ascoltare rock e metal all'età di 13 anni...è piuttosto strana come storia: avevo comprato il gioco di GTA Vice City per PS2 e su una stazione radio era presente la canzone "2 Minutes to Midnight" degli Iron Maiden...oltre a tante altre...bene, dopo un po di tempo mi sono innamorato di questa canzone, e con l'arrivo di internet poco dopo ho cominciato a conoscere meglio questo gruppo, e col tempo tutti gli altri...a poco a poco mi sono avvicinato al rock ma sempre tenendomi "attaccato" al metal, ed allora ho scoperto i Led Zeppelin, i Pink Floyd, gli AC/DC e molti altri...<br>  Beh io ho scelto il rock e il metal xkè sono generi di musica che ti da modo di sfogarti a volte...e poi xkè il rock è passione...e nel commerciale di passione x la musica non ne trovi...|`|b61f047724a12039c618c715fa00c0feaa	io ho una mamma che da giovane ascoltava ac/dc ecc...e va matta per i metallica...ho iniziato a 6 anni ad ascoltarli compresi i nirvana che me li ha fatti sentire il mio bis-cugino...ho iniziato ad ascoltare metal molto pesante quando avevo 14 anni che sn caduta in depressione e m volevo suicidare ma nn avevo forse al 100% intenzione d farlo questo mi a spinto ad andare sull'estremo ascolto ancora gothic-metal anzi credo che rimanga il mio genere preferito....<br>  Credo d nn amare il genere commerciale perchè la maggior parte sono costruiti nn sono neanche loro che scrivono la musica e i testi...ho bisogno d ascoltare quei gruppi che fanno provare emozioni e fanno sentire anke il risultato dopo tanto esercizio e prova per far piacere il cd hai fan...|`|0RFw3vtfaa	Io del Rock mi sono innamorato a tredicianni (vale a dire 3 anni fa) quando regalarono a mio padre la Platinum Collection dei Queen e quando in classe la gente mi obbligava ad ascoltare raffinati capolavori come Chiuauhua, Dj Francesco, Justin Timberlake, Linkn Park ecc... Io ascoltai qualche pezzo della Platinum di mio padre e mi innamorai prerdutamente dei Queen e così cominciai a informarmi su di loro (tanto che ormai sono una vera e propria enciclopedia) e sul rock in generale...scoprii geni come Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Kiss, Metallica, Rhapsody, Black Sabbath ecc...Oggi senza il rock io NON VIVO!!!!!!|`|56edba2b32b7c6165f36c8b214712bc8aa	Beh ho iniziato ad ascolate musica non commerciale quando ho iniziato a giocare a Cyberpunk... mi sono detto non ho sentito un vero pezzo punk, ho sentito London calling dei The Clash e God save the Queen dei Sex Pistols, da allora ho smesso di ascoltare commerciale e ho iniziato ad ascoltare la "vera" musica, ho iniziato dal Punk e poi sono andato spesso e volentieri sul metal e sul hard rock... semplicemente la commerciale non mi soddisfava più... Ora ogni volta che sento una canzone ne seguo il ritmo e a seconda del suo messaggio cambia il mio umore. (magari evito di ascoltarmi cose tipo End of all hope dei Nightwish di prima mattina ;-))|`|5FTTx5ZRaa	Io ho 13 anni. Fino all'anno scorso non facevo altro che stare a guardare i "fighi" che passavano sui giornalini e a discuterne con le mie compagne di classe. Ma non mi sono mai sentita a mio agio. Nella mia mente mi dicevo quanto fosse inutile e stupido, perchè la bellezza non è un merito. Lo stesso valeva per la musica. Ascoltavo quello che ascoltavano gli altri, senza pensare se a me piacesse o no. Ma poi mi sono veramente stufata. Era un po' che miravo i Green Day...mi piacevano sul serio (e mi piacciono tutt'ora)...mi sono informata sul genere che facevano e allora ho capito che la mia musica doveva essere quella alternativa, quella forte e spaccabudella. Allora, su consiglio di mio papà, ho comprato Back In Black, degli AC/DC...E' stato un colpo di fulmine. Ascoltavo sempre e solo quello...poi, ho scoperto il punk. Non quei dementi che a carnevale vanno in giro a sparare schiuma, il punk rock vero, fatto di protesta contro la società. E mi sono tradotta i testi, e le frasi mi sono entrate nel cervello, incisioni nelle mie cellule, sono stata folgorata da tutto questo! Ora non mi sogno nemmeno di uscire con le ochette, perchè ho capito cosa c'è di sbagliato a questo mondo! La musica "alternativa" (e il punk in particolare) mi hanno salvato dall'essere una truzza. Il rock fa miracoli, mi ha cambiato e non ho intenzione di tornare indietro! Quando ascolto questa musica sento di aver fatto bene, la mia è gratitudine verso coloro che continuano ad alimentare questa corrente!<br>  Ho scritto tutto questo per farvi capire quanto il rock sia grande, perchè chi non ci crede possa cambiare idea. Ha fatto questo a me, può farlo a chiunque!!!!<br>  ROCK, GRAZIE DI ESISTERE!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (adesso mi sembra di essere una matta esaltata, ma è così sul serio...)|`|LTSPTzC4aa	Perché è ENERGIA allo stato PURO e potenziale...<br>  <br>  Ho iniziato a 14 anni<br>  con gli Iron Maiden <br>  (che son stati il mio primo vero gruppo "scelto")<br>  e continuo ancora oggi.<br>  <br>  A differenza tua, pero',<br>  non disprezzo gli altri generi,<br>  e ne ascolto diversi<br>  (averla una voce corrispondente a quella della Pausini !),<br>  forse perché mio padre è un amante della Musica<br>  e l'ho ascoltata in casa fin dalle fasce<br>  (dalla Classica, al Jazz al Rock...)...<br>  <br>  In ogni caso, <br>  mi rimane comunque un'affinità elettiva:<br>  il Rock ed il Metal...<br>  entrano in risonanza con le mie corde...|`|LqkNYFd8aa	ho iniziato qst anno, a 14 anni....xè lo adoro|`|MXnmMXZraa	LUUUUNGO DA SCRIVERE! Ti posto la risposta che ho dato ad una domanda identica, c'è dentro perchè e percome hehe ^ ^ ".<br>  <br>  Io vivendo in una città molto bella, ma ignorante dal punto di vista musicale, ho ascoltato ciò che ii miei amici mi proponevano. Quindi Linkin Park, SOAD eccetera eccetera. Poi, verso i 13/14 anni è arrivato il computer. La voglia che avevo di evadere dalla commercialità e da quella musica terribilmente vuota mi ha dato una spinta incredibile. Il mio primo gruppo Metal sono stati i Rhapsody e con loro mi sono innamorato di questo genere. Poi anche la curiosità e la voglia di confrontare gruppi mi ha invogliato a cercarne e scaricane molti altri, di tutti i generi, idealogie, vestiari e melodie. Confesso di essere ignorante sul rock ed affini, ma ho imparato a riconoscere quando un gruppo merita veramente. Poi io sono un forte sostenitore di Salieri (alla faccia di Mozart) quindi mi piace anche la musica Classica. Ed anche quella mi ha insegnato moltissime cose, tra le quali la più importante: la musica da sola comunica più emozioni e racconta più storie di qualsiasi testo immaginabile da animo umano (mio esempio per eccellenza: i tre movimenti della sonata al chiaro di luna di Beethoven).<br>  E poi...bè, sono arrivato ai 17 anni, ho iniziato a suonare uno strumento (batteria) ed ormai vivo con la musica.

in fondo un pò di relax non fa mai male..<br>  <br>  ciao ciao

Certo, meglio un cantante che canta stonato live piuttosto uno che canta bene ma con il playback; però, un cantante che non sa cantare non può definirsi tale; è un paradossoooo!|`|8f7946d49f57a0e018ae63b5c522db83aa	confermo perchè l'ho vista dal vivo cantare don't tell me al festivalbar a lignano sabbiadoro..una delusione enorme!!|`|GIFLnq40aa	Io ho sentito la versione live di 'Nobody's home' e sono rimasta orripilata!

1588432da203f7de2b18167dca0bddd6aa	es una canción icono de la historia de los 70 nunca sera olvidada<br>  Hotel California toca diversos asuntos, incluyendo la inocencia (y su pérdida), adicción a las drogas, muerte, los peligros, tentaciones, y la fugaz naturaleza de la fama, relaciones turbulentas, divorcios y la pérdida del amor, los resultados finales de la Doctrina del destino manifiesto, y el "Sue?o Americano".<br>  <br>  Los miembros del grupo han descrito el álbum como una metáfora por su percepción del declive de América en el materialismo y decadencia. En una entrevista con la revista neerladesa ZigZag poco antes de la publicación del álbum, Don Henley afirmó:<br>  <br>  This is a concept album, there's no way to hide it, but it's not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know. It's more urban this time (. . . ) It's our bicentennial year, you know, the country is 200 years old, so we figured since we are the Eagles and the Eagle is our national symbol, that we were obliged to make some kind of a little bicentennial statement using California as a microcosm of the whole United States, or the whole world, if you will, and to try to wake people up and say 'We've been okay so far, for 200 years, but we're gonna have to change if we're gonna continue to be around.'<br>  <br>  La pista final del álbum, la canción épica "The Last Resort", trata la muerte de la sociedad. Glenn Frey, en el episodio Hotel California de In the Studio with Redbeard explicó hablando de la pista:<br>  <br>  It was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment...we're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at somepoint there is going to be no more new frontiers.

( osea que le estaba vendiendo su alma)<br>  entonces pues se quedo muy desconcertado y hasta fue a ver el cuarto donde la mujer supuestamente murio.y donde supuestamente habia tomado la copa con la mujer..<br>  Y por esta razon compuso la cancion y eh ahi del origen de esta<br>  si la traducen se daran cuenta que mas o menos cuenta algo de esta historia<br>  Bueno pues eso es lo que yo se de la letra de la cancion <br>  " hotel california"|`|wKg26wGJaa	Es una cancion excelente!<br>  La letra no es satanica, pero fue muy buena propaganda gratis, porque al crearse la controversia hubo mucha mas gente que se intereso y no por el supuesto mensaje si no por la publicidad.<br>  Muchos dicen que es porque usan la palabra "spirits", pero se esta refiriendo al vino. Esta cancion tambien puede ser interpretada como si se refiriera a una adiccion (the beast) y lo dificil que es dejarla, asi que si alguien quiere encontrarle un significado este seria muy positivo.|`|Bg08PBNmaa	satanico???..psss hahahaha satanicos son los nakos que dijieron eso!! esa rola esta buenisama pss de los '80o no??<br>  que mal que no apresien las buenas rolas como esa!!!|`|GMOsECklaa	Jajajaja, nemesis divina que chi.gona respuesta jajajajajajaja, aparte de que tienes razon jjajajajajaja|`|h7u3YP8eaa	Opino ke es una genial cancion, me encanta, en especial el inicio con la guitarra :P|`|c5371aa1f7d61c767cf5e0c93b6d2117aa	Satánicos mis calzones.

Lei non pensa che la bomba di Hiroshima fu il peggior attacco terroristico della storia? In quel momento suona la campanella dell'intervallo e tutti gli alunni escono dall'aula. Al ritorno, Bush invita nuovamente i bambini a fare delle domande e Joe gli chiede: - Presidente, ho cinque domande da farle: 1. Perché perdendo le votazioni alle urne Lei ha vinto le elezioni? 2. Perché desidera attaccare l'Iraq senza motivo? 3. Lei non pensa che la bomba di Hiroshima fu il peggior attacco terroristico della storia? 4.

3O29BwMwaa	Bé chi ha inventato le parole...NOI. Prova ad immedesimarti in un cavernicolo che vuole fare capire ad un amico a cosa si sta riferendo...prima i gesti, disegni, poi si comincia ad emettere suoni, e questi diventano sempre più articolati fino a portare alla creazione di una lingua. Naturalmente parliamo di millenni e millenni. Poi ogni parola ha un suo motivo di esistere, x esempio le prime parole si riferivano al suono che facevano le cose, che ne so i tuoni, le cascate, etc. Questo per quanto riguarda i primordi. Poi quando le culture si incontrano ci sono scambi linguistici e tutto diventa più complicato. Comunque è un argomento molto molto molto complicato perché parlare della lingua è come parlare dell'essere umano e quello che possiamo sapere è limitato.<br>  In breve, le parole le inventi TU in senso molto più globale naturalmente come individuo di una cultura/società.<br>  Considera la lingua come una creatura vivente. E soprattutto al giorno d'oggi questa cresce in modo spaventoso vista la facilità con cui circolano le informazioni.<br>  Bella domanda|`|a6whMx4Haa	penso sia lo stesso personaggio (mi perdoni per averLo nominato così) che dato il nome donna al suo primo ed unico errore.....ihiihiihihih...ciauuuuu!!!|`|HtLWCbFFaa	ma perche quando e nata la parola hanno solo messo dei suoni in fila che formassero un suono carino....

EWW! that is so tacky!! and they def aren't ABDC!!!!!!!!! by far!! <br>  <br>  one thing i do think he is right that this years ABDC will be a girl group and that's Beat freaks!!!!!!!!!! they are awesome and have been my fave since day 1.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	no he probably thinks one or all the chicks are hott thats all  but the other girl group was pretty good|`|lGbEs0Z7aa	Fly Khicks are going home next episode. They cannot beat out The Beat Freaks or Quest Crew. They were in the bottom two twice for a reason, they aren't that great. It doesn't seem like they are that creative. My favorite group were The Ringmasters. They had a new dance style and that one boy was just so cute. But I hope the Beat Freaks take the title home

xSbTGOknaa	Eros Ramazzotti is very popular and has some beautiful songs. Have you heard "L'Aurora" or "Un'altra te"<br>  or  "Un emozione per sempre" .

L'allenatore per i diavoli e' LUCIFERO e per gli angeli GESU'. La partita va avanti con molta monotonia e con continui rimpalli. Ad un tratto, quasi allo scadere del secondo tempo, San Gennaro stoppa di petto e passa a San Filippo il quale, ricevendo la palla, si ringalluzzisce e inizia a dribblare tutti gli avversari, arrivando solo in area. Di fronte a lui il portiere, un diavolaccio di prima categoria, prova a fermarlo con tutti i mezzi piu' indecenti e piu' subdoli, ma San Filippo, ormai caricato dribbla anche quello, prende la mira, tira e... palo! "Oh Porcamado***!" esclama San Filippo. "San Filippo !" urla Gesu' e con il sangue agli occhi si avvicina a lui con fare minaccioso. "Scusami, Gesu', non volevo offendere tua madre, scusami, scusami..." implora San Filippo tutto impaurito per la bestemmi che gli e' uscita di bocca. E Gesu' tutto imbelvito: "Mia madre 'na sega!

yOLeRiTZaa	.<br>  <br>  ~_~.<br>  <br>  Wulfruna--<br>  <br>  Yes, Women do tend to be the voices for many cartoon characters if the character is to remain young. Or when the character is say an animal or an object.<br>   <br>  1 woman will even be the voice for more then one character within the same cartoon.<br>  <br>  Of course if the role is a man, then a man's voice is used. A man's voice will also be used in a cartoon MOVIE vs. a daily show like those on Nick Jr.<br>  <br>  Take Care!!<br>  <br>  ____ ~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|1OJNgIVyaa	Yes women do tend to do voices for all children in cartoons and animations because men cannot make their voices high enough or innocent enough because their voice has broken. It is also cheaper for some shows because women often get paid less than men and they can get the same voice to play many different characters as women can play both boys and girls.|`|TGWETA8caa	Yes a lot of women do voiceovers for young boys. Their voices fit and because they can show range in emotion and be well acted. A lot of American and Anime voiceovers are done that way. Unless the kid is really really talented, just as in Avartar: The Last Airbender, I think the main character Aang is done my pre-teen boy.|`|IbtEvdriaa	yeah a lot are women because men cannot make their voices high enough to be boys, as their voices have broken!
F60JZOU3aa	Kurumada put his manga Saint Seiya in hiatus after the Hades arc in 1991, and so it remains to this day. He plans to resume it with the publishing of the Heaven Chapter in the near future. Although he is currently writing and drawing Saint Seiya Next Dimension, it is actually a prequel.<br>  so the answer is no

I was at work, saying good morning to my boss while putting on my black sweater, when he looks at me crazy and says...

My father was not in the picture at this time.( get my drift?) Anyways, me and my 4 younger brothers were supposed to sit in the pew while my mother played. Well, I looked around and didn't see my brothers. My mother gave me a look that told me that I should see about it. I found them rolling under the pews during the service! Unfortunately, the pastor had to address the situation.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	My son sneezed so violently that he banged his head on the chair in front of him and caused the two men doing the service at the lecturn to actually stop, look at him, and say "Bless you".|`|le0LsiVUaa	Me and my cousin made a godbotherer cry when we stuck in pur halloween fangs...we got tod off by the almighty god botherer that was our sunday school teacher :D <br>  need i tell you my cousin and i were not followers?|`|OsejQXvoaa	Does a knock-down dragout fight right in the middle of the sermon count as embarassing?

I was too old to be falling asleep in church too.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Well instead of attending choir practice, I ran around the church with someone, snooping in different offices.

(I swear it echoed).  One guy behind us said to her "you know, the first impression is the one that lasts."<br>  <br>  Church story: With the same friend, I went to her church and after the sermon we went to their "game room" where they have a pool table and a foozeball table. It was just me and her and her brother in there, and the door was open, and she missed the ball she was trying to hit (pool) and starts yelling really loud (because she likes attention) and said " God Damnit!! This F-ing game sucks!) and threw her pool stick and it hit the window and cracked it. two seconds later the pastor walks in and gave her the dirtiest look. Turns out he was in the next room and heard everything.<br>  She's quite rude.
pLPKo6mBaa	Okay well I'm not going to pretend to be one of those people who say there's no good music from my country, since I like hundreds of bands from the US!

I dunno, after I read up on the band/artist if I look at them I can just remember where they're from most of the time and vice versa.

3yNh5jO8aa	Hate is a very strong word. I generally don't use it.<br>  "intense hostility and aversion usually deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury "|`|CYhOr4s7aa	its fake ,  yeah but people love to jump on the gravy train  no back bone of there own  <br>  <br>  personally i strongly dislike  people like this ,  in life they are followers too|`|gMwZqKeGaa	Normally I Wouldn't Say I Hated Someone And Actually Mean It And Mi M8's Know That So That Normally Doesn't Happen :D But Yh, I Wud H8 It If I Actually Meant It. Especially When Some One B*tchs Bout People When I Havn't Actually Said Anything Mean About Them!<br>  It Annoying... x|`|6CU00J1Yaa	Jennifer Tilley is awesome.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	He who angers you conquers you. I try not to hate anyone or let anyone make me feel those feelings. If I don't like someone I just don't waste my time.|`|le0LsiVUaa	I hate it when I say I hate someone/something<br>  as I don't ACTUALLY hate them just strongly dislike <br>  but i hate it when my friends point this out haha|`|hDAoKmjPaa	yes i hate it too.
sjD26raeaa	No one deserves to die just because they are barefoot. LOL<br>  <br>  You sure are stuck on barefoot girls lol<br>  If a girl is barefoot and is chases she should always have a weapon ready<br>  weather a baesball bat or golf club<br>  <br>  my mom taught me something she learned in self-defense class many years ago that i still do to this day and don't realize it- Whenever I am out- not just alone too- I place my keys between my fingers so if anyone was to attack- i'd get them in the throat and run like the wind lol
ARUAh8wOaa	I got a bottle of it at whole foods but it was around 17 dollars. how much do you want?|`|LaQ8Ejt3aa	you can get a small bottle of ready to use, freshly made great paste here.<a href="http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/paste.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/paste.h...</a><br>  I do this all the time.<br>  It is so much fun.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	well u can find it at a local indian store, and its usually around 5 dollars|`|7mt3YWVeaa	don't know sorry|`|VuGMOf4Caa	You can buy any type of henna at any asian supermarket/shop or any good supermarket - here in the UK Tesco will sell it but only in powder forms
cumhOqjXaa	hmmm i watched that movie long ago i personally dont think its that scary just a lilttle.<br>  but yes its based on true EVENSTS! ooo Sp00ky!<br>  O.o|`|g5RS83paaa	I don't watch scary movies anymore, I'll have my daughter watch it, she loves them|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I'm not sure if this particular movie was based on real events but there is another movie that was based on real events, Amityville Horror.|`|4nQVsEHnaa	It was a true story and yes it was a good movie|`|aZXnW6AUaa	It is a true story.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	What's with all the damn question marks? Jeez.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	I was seriously disappointed. <br>  <br>  I looove horror movies, especially ones based on true events but I think those people were all on hallucinogens or something! If the mother saw that her daughter was getting raped by her dad why the hell wouldn't she do something? And then the story goes on and she finds the girls bloodied clothes and pretends she doesn't know where they came from!? How sick.  <br>  <br>  I would rather watch The Strangers over and over again... now that was a good 'based on true events' film. Sorry, but I just didn't buy into the whole 'born from evil and stolen purity.'|`|2e03d9c0ae13a3d9eea4f64e4eb3a52aaa	They say it's based on a true story in order to sell tickets. I mean, come on, it's only loosely based on the story of some girl who lived through poltergeist activity. <br>  <br>  I thought it was one of the most boring stories every written and the only scarey thought was of Donald Sutherland having sex with his on-screen daughter.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	I didn't really like it.  I understood what it was about and what they were getting at but it really didn't make a lot of sense.  Just because it says it was based on a true story doesn't mean the movie doesn't have made up parts.  For instance when kids get abused it effects them mentally, she could have been abused and just gone psycho and in that period of time they believed it was spirits and witches|`|Rodj52Swaa	???? NEVER SEEN THE MOVIE?????????|`|KkRb3paPaa	I thought it was kind of scary.. i'm not watching it again lol|`|gMwZqKeGaa	Wot Movies This? Never Heard It... :S O Well! >:( This Yahoo Thing Has Just Told Mi I Have Used A Lot Of Punctuation. Two Words, Well DUH!!|`|c3j49t9Faa	I think an american haunting is good except now I'm addicted to question marks too???????????????????????????????|`|jhGnpoz0aa	i think it is really good <br>  i usually dont watch scary movies either

AA12003782	HAHAHA the dude above me is funny.lol. Record labels now are stupid they only tend to sign artists who would make songs out now. With that kind of hip-hop. Rappers now whoare forced to make stupid songs just for airplay & for money are like sellouts or "Uncle Toms" when you think about. 50 Cent is a great example of that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another reason is probably becuase they knew his album wasn't going to sell becuase u know a lot of people who listens to music out now won't be into that kind of music. I guess.|`|L6DRLoCjaa	its sorta obvious that he wont appeal to the mainstream audience. we all know that mainstream labels could care less about content. I am kinda mad at this cuz im a big tribe fan, but what can you do?<br>  I wonder why other labels like kweli's label or other independent labels havent signed him to put out records, though.|`|227cd370f2563f40d62c8bdea08c6e29aa	wow that is a good question<br>  <br>  maybe becuase he left his wallet in el sugendo? idk <br>  <br>  that is true he is much diffrent than what is out today, but still true to himself and what was hip hop<br>  <br>  he doesnt explain explicitly how to *** a hoe he raps about things that matter, no he isnt as socially consicnes sp? like public enemy or people like that, back with ATCQ they were out to party and have fun, and they were just fun to listen to and i cant wait for ATCQs new album|`|PCVVTiStaa	Why would they pass on Q-tip?<br>  How else do you clean your ears??|`|d3776fdcdf44ac8ddd57d7223b15828daa	Because anyone who says "12-gauge rifle" obviously has no knowledge of firearms, therefore he will not sell.
6HyFHrfIaa	If you are built like Kim, you must be very hot.|`|m2vBJaHKaa	Genetics ;)|`|AA11429880	There is nothing wrong with the way you are built.  You look great!  BTW, 125-130 pounds is not going to be a 2 or 4.  My thinnest weight was 125 at 5'3" and I wore a 10.  Of course body composition may be different, but I don't think you're going to get a 2-4 out of 125 pounds.  Don't worry about the number on the tag or even on the scale, if you look good (and you do) and are healthy, that's all they are....numbers.|`|vRZolfOraa	Firstly I must say that despite your want to be smaller - you are a very beautiful lady! I wish I had your figure!<br>  <br>  If you want to loose weight - remember to eat healthily and drink plenty of water. It may be that your metabolism will work better if you have 4 or 5 small meals a day rather than the set 3 of breakfast lunch and dinner. Foods that will make you feel fuller for longer but are still low in calories are good, such as vegetables, fruit, whole grains etc<br>  <br>  As for exercise, a good cardio workout would benefit weight loss and burn fat. Exercises to trim and tone your lower half would be things like jogging, skipping (!), squats and lunges and sit ups. Remember to breather correctly otherwise you will end up with muscle forming over fat rather than a toned appearance! Try altering your lifestyle slightly, do more walking, drive or take the bus less. Little changes can soon add up.<br>  <br>  Combining a healthy diet and exercise programme will improve your overall health as well as aid weight loss. Though remember that you may get days or weeks when you need to work little harder to shift the weight, these plataus are common so don't worry just keep at it! <br>  <br>  A little tip is to give yourself some motivation - stick up a picture of yourself where you are not looking your best, somewhere you are likely to see it on a daily basis. This can encourage you to put away that biscuit you just got out or to grb your trainers and go running!<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember anything is possible!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xxx|`|e9gsf1GJaa	yeaa, just exercise and eat small amounts of food.<br>  dont skip any meals cause it slows you down,<br>  you cant be energetic without nutrition.<br>  i lost like 10 pounds in 1 month cause of thiis method.<br>  you can also do like 50 situps before you go to sleep and when you wake up.<br>  <br>  try it :D|`|OaXsSAPdaa	Wrong section.<br>  Lose weight.

17orTrcRaa	It was the song that they sang when they met...Start of Something New.|`|PVy5DSpNaa	Start of Something New|`|xGLndW9Paa	I think it's "Start of Something New" because they wouldn't play "My Humps" on Disney Channel because it has some inappropriate words that are bad for kids who watch Disney Channel. Also, they would not play "We're All in This Together" because they wouldn't want to give away the song before anyone has even heard it yet. They probably played "Start of Something New" because Troy wanted to remember his singing experience so he set it as his ringtone.

Precisamente, disegnando Ranma 1\2, il mio primo manga (in Italia pubblicato in versione fumetto).<br>  Mentre cercavo di disegnare dei miei personaggi simili a quelli del fumetto, ho imparato molto bene le proporzioni e poi col tempo ognuno si fa la propria tecnica di disegno.<br>  Il fumetto Ranma 1\2, aiuta molto nel vedere le proporzioni del corpo, che rispetto a molti altri manga è meno visibile.<br>  <br>  Quello che sto cercando di dire, è che io nn ho mai disegnato dal vivo. <br>  Ora che sto cambiando scuola ed ho deciso di andare in un Artistico devo recuperare le materie di disegno.<br>  Sto facendo degli esercizi che con il disegno "manga" nn c'entra niente, eppure ... nn percepisco alcun intoppo mentre cerco di copiare un immagine o ritrarre persone.<br>  <br>  E' da anni che disegno dei miei personaggi inventati di sana pianta, e pian piano sto raffinando sempre di più la mia tecnica in meglio.<br>  <br>  Sn più che sicura, che se anche tu continuerai a disegnare (anche per sl divertimento cm me) diventeraisemrpe più brava.<br>  <br>  Ciauz.|`|5WfIMwtLaa	brava anzi bravissima ( sei una femmina,vero? )! tutti i miei complimenti!a me è piaciuto di + il terzo!<br>  ma nel secondo è impressione mia o Vegeta ha i capelli di sopra piatti?|`|86b512c0ae032b169096409c9dad7f6caa	se nn hai preso spunto da nessun altra immagine sei stato davvero bravo! a me vengono molto bene i disegni, ma solo se ricopio un'immagine che ho davanti..sennò nn saprei da che parte cominciare! se invece li hai fatti a memoria complimenti! però come hanno già detto alcuni potresti migliorare ancora molto..un mio consiglio: prova a sfumarli con la matita per effetti luci ombra! darai più volume!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	brava!!!!!|`|NOFUFIuxaa	potresti fare un pò di + cmq brava!!! ma quanto c'hai in ed artistica???|`|NllOyO3Haa	il + bello sec me è il secondo!!!cmq brava!!!ma xk nel terzo disegno c'è scritto francesco?<br>  <br>  <br>  ah.....scusa se ho letto male!!!!ancora i miei complimenti!!!!=)|`|S9KLx5C2aa	AH! ecco cosa fai al posto di ascoltare la lezione di matematica!

"sn davvero miei?!" "MIEI VERI disegni" .. cavoli, non è che hai disegnato questo <a href="http://kjun.org/hue_1500.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kjun.org/hue_1500.jpg</a> !!<br>  sono sei disegnini del cavolo scopiazzati da un manga, perchè non ti si dovrebbe credere?!<br>  <br>  segui i miei consigli:<br>  1. NON disegnare manga. non imparerai mai a disegnare decentemente. inizia a disegnare cose serie e realistiche e quando sai fare quello, se ti piace, passa ad assumere uno stile manga.  molti pensano che disegnare così <a href="http://www.vitella.it/mikami/img/manga/manga01.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitella.it/mikami/img/manga/m...</a> sia più semplice che disegnare così <a href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/image/CaptainAmerica_Thor.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/imag...</a> o così <a href="http://www.scudit.net/mdpunto_file/dylan2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.scudit.net/mdpunto_file/dylan...</a> perchè ci sono "meno linee" e questo è uno dei motivi che stanno facendo affermare i manga. tutti li vedono e pensano "wow, posso farlo anche io". la verità è l'autore di questo <a href="http://www.vitella.it/mikami/img/manga/manga01.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitella.it/mikami/img/manga/m...</a> per tracciare quelle due linee ha fatto anni e anni di disegni dal vivo e scuole d'arte, quindi lui ora può permettersi di fare quelle due righe, tu riesci solo a scopiazzare disegni mediocri.<br>  <br>  2. impara a ripassare i disegni. vai in una cartoleria, compra un grafos o anche solo delle tip pen, disegna con la matita morbida, ripassa e cancella la matita con la gomma pane.<br>  <br>  3. visto che posti i disegni si presume che tu abbia uno scanner. impara almeno a colorare i tuoi disegni con il photoshop, vedrai che ne guadagnano.<br>  <br>  ciao|`|gzBDv4Fnaa	:-O...sn stupendi!!!! <br>  datti all'arte , sn bellissimi...|`|lk4CriQjaa	bravo by goten|`|np7EPbJIaa	sn tutti karini...brava...magari sapessi disegnare bene anke io...t giuro ke sn una frana... <br>  :(<br>  ciao ciao...baci|`|q8PCSzgjaa	sono molto belli!!!!!|`|suIPOo2vaa	che carini, ma come hai fatto a metterli si internet??!!!!<br>  ank'io me la cavo abbastanza bene!!!!!!<br>  ciao e continua ad esercitarti!!!!!!!|`|tngvws6saa	Sì... non c'è male... ma devi ancora migliorarti e continuare ad evolvere il tuo stile... magari prova a vedere qualche manga e guarda bene i particolari dei disegni (come le proporzioni o le posizioni delle mani...). Io ho davvero imparato molto ispirandomi ai manga! Diciamo che, per ora, vanno bene anche se, detto senza alcuna cattiveria, non sono ancora eccellenti...<br>  Buon inizio comunque! XD il primo soprattutto è molto curato... CIAO XD!

ivjHOJ8daa	Aw you have a real beautiful voice. You've just got a subscription from me! (ShionaProductions)<br>  <br>  What you should try doing, is go down to Tesco, for ￡3.00 you'll get a nice wee desktop microphone, start record yourself singing.<br>  <br>  Upload it to Youtube, you could leave the video blank, or just put random pictures in. <br>  <br>  Sorted.

Keep going!!!|`|dsEHMTyJaa	I think you have a great voice.  You're 13, right??  You sound like a 13 year old with talent instead of a 13 year old trying to fake it by having had one too many voice lessons.

H6IE7xeaaa	Probably the Fender if youre gonna go thru Craigslist, the Gibson would be an awesome choice if its within your pricerange, Gibson makes some of the nicest guitars I've played.|`|yCU362o3aa	i have a fender and it is amazing. I've had it since i was 6. Make sure that it isn't glued though. Many guitars if they are broke, people will glue them back together. Get a guitar book to help you learn. I taught myself in a month from a book called Guitar For Dummies. I'm pretty good now. Find a good pick that you like. The size of the pick makes a big difference. Taylor Swift songs are easy to play too. They are not hard and require little knowledge about a lot of chords. <br>  Learn these chords first cause they are easier and in many songs: A, E, D, C, G, Am, and Em. Then go on to the harder chords such as F, and so on. Hope this helps

Y4Tbb4yraa	Non'è proprio così...Nella versione originale si chiamano Tashuke,Oymoio,Matsumyoe Tariede...tipici nomi giapponesi<br>  In italia hanno messo dei nomi che principalmente avrebbero indicato l'italia,quindi il fatto dei nomi dei pittori e stato attribuito al doppiaggio del cartone animano e all'esportazione del  fumetto in italia...<br>  in francia si chiamano con nomi inerenti a grandi scultori dell'epoca bellica della francia...quasi tutti i cartoni animati usano diffondere i propri simboli della loro nazione...<br>  Diciamo semplicemente che e un modo di far conoscere qualche personaggio importante...anche se alla fine nel cartone animato,del personaggio (ad esempio raffaello) rimane solo il nome...|`|839d9c9b5e0bc5f858ad67553ccc7c5faa	Nela versione italiana viene detto che il maestro Splinter aveva scelto questi nomi perchè erano i nomi dei suoi pittori preferiti, che sono appunto gli artisti del Rinascimento più importanti: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raffello e Donatello.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	per le maschere colorate?|`|86b512c0ae032b169096409c9dad7f6caa	e perchè gli piace la pizza? ...bè, questo nn c'è bisogno di giustificarlo! xD<br>  cmq ogni volta che le elenco me ne manca sempre una di tartaruga...un po' come quando si contano i 7 nani..|`|Ktuf0On2aa	Nel cartone (la serie vecchia, trasmessa negli States dal 1987,) il Maestro Splinter spiegava di essersi ispirato ad un libro sul rinascimento trovato nelle fogne. Non è un'italianizzazione, si chiamano così anche in inglese, con i nomi come vengono detti e scritti in inglese: Raphael, Leonard, Michaelangelo (?) e Donatello credo che sia uguale.<br>  <br>  Ho guardato adesso il sito ufficiale, sembra che Michaelangelo fosse un errore di battitura che è rimasto, ma nelle serie nuove è stato corretto.<br>  Inoltre Leonardo viene chiamato Leonardo, ma io ricordo che sui gadget anni 80/90 era Leonard. Magari qui ricordo male.<br>  <br>  Inoltre, gli autori, avevano deciso di dare loro nomi europei, perchè se avessero dato nomi giapponesi sarebbero suonati troppo strani per il pubblico americano. Avendo entrambi studiato la storia dell'arte decisero per dei pittori rinascimentali.<br>  <br>  Nella storia originale, il fumetto, (che avendo toni molto cupi non è stato rispettato fedelmente nella realizzazione del cartone, che era più indirizzato ai bambini,) il maestro Splinter non era originariamente un umano, bensì un ratto da compagnia, animale domestico di Hamato Yoshi, che è stato ucciso da un collega-rivale malvagio (quello che poi divenne Shredder).<br>  In effetti questo è quello che succede anche nel primo film.|`|SUI6H0Tlaa	Non so se hai mai visto i film .... nel primo (parlo di quello del 1990) Splinter spiega che nel "battezzare" le tartarughe si era ispirato a un libro sul Rinascimento italiano trovato in una fogna.<br>  <br>  PS. NON E' ASSOLUTAMENTE VERO CHE E' UN' ITALIANIZZAZIONE!! Si chiamano e si sono sempre chiamati Raffaello (Raphael), Leonardo, Michaelangelo e Donatello! Maidens sostiene che nella versione originale si chiamavano "Tashuke,Oymoio,Matsumyo e Tariede", al 95% se l'è inventato di sana pianta (da modesta lettrice di manga e appassionata di Giappone non mi sembrano neanche nomi giapponesi veri), al 5% ha preso un abbaglio grosso come una casa!! ;)<br>  Ti lascio il link al sito ufficiale delle TMNT in inglese, dove nella sezione "COMICS" puoi leggere il PRIMISSIMO capitolo del fumetto ORIGINALE scritto nel 1984 da  Kevin Eastman e Peter Laird (cioè i creatori della serie), vedrai che i nomi sono quelli! <a href="http://www.ninjaturtles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ninjaturtles.com/</a>|`|eft7JQPmaa	Per italianizzarle credo!!<br>  <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarughe_Ninja" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarughe_...</a>|`|42Ocrnz5aa	anche io me lo chiedevo ma non avevavo pensato ad una italianizzazione!!!|`|UCGGJvhBaa	dai un'occhiata su wikipedia...|`|YqrnbtLcaa	Perchè splinter il lor maestro quando erano tartarughe normali e lui era un uomo gli ha dato i nomi dei suoi artisti preferiti.

Sostenuto, is depressed after the keys have been struck, but before they are released. This pedal holds the dampers only for the keys struck off of the strings, allowing them to ring freely as long as the pedal is engaged.<br>  ? Bass Damper pedal. A cheezy solution to the more complicated sostenuto device, the dampers below the treble break are lifted from the strings. Most often Sostenuto is used with pedal points, and this is an easy compromise for lower cost instruments.<br>  ? Practice Pedal: current uprights drop a felt rail between the hammers and the strings attenuating the sound of the piano. In instruments where the center pedal is a practice pedal, it can shifted to the left after it is engaged to keep the felt rail in place<br>  ? Tack rail/Honky Tonk: in some older uprights, a tack rail is dropped between the hammers and strings. It works identically to the practice pedal above, but changes the sound of the piano to something completely horrifiying and banjo-like.<br>  <br>  Left: Una Corda:<br>  ? In most grand pianos, this pedal shifts the action to the right enough that on tri-chord strings, only two strings are played, on bi-chords, only one, and on single strings in the bass, the hammer strikes the strings with the softer edge felt than the center. This both lowers the volume of the piano and causes the piano to sound less stridant.<br>  ? in uprights and a few grands, the Una Corda pedal moves the hammer rail closer to the strings. Effectivly allowing for less inertia of the hammers and lowering the volume of the instrument. The problem with moving the hammer rail (especially in grands) is that lost motion is introduced to the action, and the instrument plays less uniformly while the pedal is engaged. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ptg.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ptg.org</a>|`|CWejvYyuaa	the sound from a piano comes from a hammer hitting a string when you depress the key, depending on how much force you put into it, the louder the sound is; hence the name pianoforte.

AA11338500	I would recommend Goong (also listed under the name Princess Hours or Imperial Household)...it's really sweet and soo romantic! You can watch it at <a href="http://aznv.tv" rel="nofollow">http://aznv.tv</a> (search for Imperial Household!). The drama is about an everyday girl that ends up in arranged marriage with the crown prince of Korea. They don't get along very well at all and he seems like a cold, heartless jerk. As the story progresses though, things start to heat up between them and it's just soo great! <br>  <br>  I would also recommend the drama My Lovely Sam Soon. It's completely hilarious in my opinion and the characters are so lovable. It's about a pastry chef named Sam Soon who ends up working in a restaurant owned by this (hot!) guy she supposedly "hates." They fight like cats and dogs, but in order to stop his mother from setting him up on arranged dates, the main guy character makes a contract with Sam Soon to have a "fake relationship." It's really sweet and it made me laugh all the time!<br>  <br>  I hope some of these help and have fun watching! Korean dramas are the best :)|`|a052dc456e1f451731b2c51844eaf4c2aa	the best i've seen so far are <br>  my lovely samsoon<br>  full house <br>  hello my lady, and<br>  someday|`|a5ae2db644493532d2b1a734565c0346aa	<a href="http://www.koreanfilm.org/tvdramas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreanfilm.org/tvdramas/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Heres a link for a list of korean dramas and movies..i aslo dont speak koren...but i try to get them in subtitiles when i can...there pretty great! hope this helps..you should find something   you like here...|`|zaAI1JVtaa	alot like my girl, autume tale, sad sonna, lover at paris even though i dont speak korean but i still watch it

20e67a751121ab0791980b62bc2f934aaa	You may be thinking of the show "The Ghost Busters". <br>  <br>  It was on for a single season, from 1975-1976, but you may have seen it in reruns. It featured two guys (played by Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, formerly of the show "F-Troop") and an ape named Tracy (a guy in a gorilla suit) that would chase ghosts. <br>  <br>  The property was revived in the mid-1980's by Filmation as a cartoon to capitalize on the success of the 1984 movie "Ghostbusters", but aside from the basic premise of chasing ghosts, neither "The Ghost Busters" nor "Filmation's Ghostbusters" has anything to do with the movie.|`|u2rtBlICaa	I am from Australia but I remember a show called Shadow Chasers with Dennis Dugan.

T__T NOOOOOO ORLYYYY!!!!|`|6t2Jxfcmaa	Dopo "Pirati dei Caraibi: ai Confini del Mondo", <br>  la Disney archivierà la saga e passerà ad altro. <br>  Strano, visto il successo della saga e la tendenza dello studio a sfruttare qualsiasi franchise fino all'osso, ma forse la cosa si poteva intuire quando Jerry Bruckheimer si è messo a lavorare ad altri franchise come National Treasure 2 e Prince of Persia. <br>  Lo storico produttore della trilogia evidentemente già sapeva che non avrebbe più avuto molto da fare dopo il terzo film.<br>  <br>  Ed è proprio lui a confermare l'ipotesi durante una intervista nella quale ha anche detto che al momento non ci sono state proiezioni-test del terzo film perchè la post-produzione, serratissima, terminerà sul filo del rasoio con l'uscita nei cinema. Cinematical suggerisce che l'assenza di proiezioni-test renderà tutto molto rischioso, perché è proprio a causa delle proiezioni anticipate del secondo film che la Disney ha fatto mesi e mesi di riprese aggiuntive alla fine del 2006 (aggiustando le cose che non andavano per il terzo film), e che ora non potrà correggere all'ultimo in fase di montaggio.<br>  <br>  Il rischio c'è, ed è alto, anche perché il budget del film è stato di 272 milioni (venti più di Spider-Man 3, uno dei più alti della storia); ma con gli incassi del primo film (oltre 700 milioni) e del secondo (quasi 1,1 miliardi di dollari) è un rischio che valeva la pena correre.<br>  <br>  Riguardo al sequel, comunque, se in passato Johnny Depp e lo stesso Bruckheimer avevano mostrato segnali di apertura, ora è proprio quest'ultimo a gettare acqua sul fuoco. Nell'intervista all'Herald Sun il produttore ha chiaramente detto:<br>  <br>      "Questa è la fine, la fine della trilogia.<br>      E' la fine, ma forse un personaggio o un paio di loro potrebbero continuare, è una possibilità. Ovviamente in un momento, verso la fine del film, viene mostrata la speranza che qualcos'altro possa succedere."<br>  <br>  <br>  ...Questo è ovvio soprattutto per il discorso che si faceva prima sulla Disney. Ma i rischi finanziari intrapresi sono stati davvero alti, e un quarto film costerebbe davvero molto di più, soprattutto perché Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley (che ha già detto di essere stufa del proprio personaggio) e Orlando Bloom chiederebbero una marea di soldi se tornassero.<br>  ******************<br>  Altri siti dicono (cito testualmente)<br>  <br>  "Che la triologia dei Pirati dei Caraibi andrà avanti con altri capitoli è ormai cosa certa."<br>  <br>  <br>  NON SI SA INSOMMA!<br>  credo sia più probabile che andranno avanti,<br>  ci guadagnano troppo x mollare.<br>  (e cmq lo spero perchè mi son piaciuti molto tutti e 3!)|`|Q6W5fPCOaa	Si. Pirati dei Caraibi è bellissimo. Spero che nel prossimo ci sia Orlando Bloom.

33512192ac94f0538a5ed1d1e4a161c5aa	guarda, ascolto poco il punk, ma questo volantino dei cccp è un buon esempio x definire il punk:<br>  <br>  PUNK Punk può essere tutto e lo è  <br>         allo stesso tempo è niente e lo è <br>           è il nostro punto di partenza e di arrivo<br>           NO FUTURE<br>           NO FUTURE<br>           NO FUTURE<br>        Se dobbiamo avere dei conti in sospeso, non è con il rock&roll ma con la <br>        storia europea. non è un problema di canzonette, anche se è difficile <br>        credere in qualcosa che sia più grande di un 33 giri.<br>        PUNK NON E' UN GENERE MUSICALE.<br>        Se comincia tramite la musica, se si manifesta nelle canzoni è solo perchè <br>        altri canali sono diventati impraticabili. Che forza d'impatto e che <br>        credibilità hanno negli anni '80 l'arte, la politica, la filosofia?<br>        E la teologia?<br>        PUNK NON GARANTISCE NIENTE ALLA VISTA<br>        E' come l'abito che fa il monaco all'apparenza, ma tutti sapevano quando i <br>        monaci esistevano che "l'abito non fa il monaco" anche se serve per fare <br>        un monaco magari solo per distinguerlo dai laici.<br>        PUNK NON E' UNA QUESTIONE ECONOMICA<br>        Un disco non è punk perchè costa mille lire, anche se in questo momento un <br>        disco che costa mille lire è un disco punk perchè lo fanno solo i punk (se <br>        qualche istituzione regalasse sarebbe per questo punk?)<br>        Fare i conti con la realtà pensando che sia solo questione di soldi gioca <br>        brutti scherzi nella ricchezza come nella miseria. Nonn perchè tutti <br>        adorano il denaro e si rovinano la vita disprezzarlo la salva.<br>        PUNK NON E' UNA QUESTIONE POLITICO-IDEOLOGICA<br>        anche se ha fatto dell'anarchia un credo ideologico per poter <br>        sopravvivere. L'ideologia anarchica, come quella comunista, ha fatto il <br>        suo tempo, anzi, rimanendo teoria e non riuscendo mai a trasformarsi in <br>        realtà ha dimostrato un difetto congenito: quello di perdere sempre.<br>        L'ideologia comunista trasformata in socialismo reale ci ha reso due <br>        favori di cui non possiamo non essere non riconescenti: a) ha trasformato <br>        la condizione umana liberandone le potenzialità (che la maggior parte <br>        della gente non ne approfitti non ci riguarda, al momento); b) ci ha <br>        liberato dall'esigenza di fare la rivoluzione. Basta la loro, per tutti.<br>        Il problema adesso è un altro, anche se non sappiamo bene quale.<br>        PUNK NON E' UNA QUESTIONE RELIGIOSA<br>        nemmeno in negativo<br>        PUNK NON E' UN'AZIONE SOCIALE<br>        anche se ne fa uso. Occupare le case sfitte a volte è giusto. Una casa non <br>        è buona perchè è occupata, ma per la gente che vi abita, occupante, <br>        affittuaria o padrona che sia.<br>        Questo però non vuole essere un ritornello per gli sciocchi: non è questo <br>        non è quello non è questo non è quello non è questo non è quello.<br>        IL PUNK E' MORTO! IL PUNK NON E' ANCORA NATO!

YBvJKdQYaa	Con un po' di trigonometria, tenendo presente il raggio della terra (6327 Km), l'altezza di un osservatore (facciamo un 1,70 mt, anche se sono giapponesi e, di conseguenza nani) e la linea che va dall'osservatore fino alla linea dell'orizzonte, si ottiene che la distanza a cui un giocatore vede l'orizzonte e di 4,53 Km. Tenuto conto che la traversa della porta compare quando un giocatore e' piu o meno sulla tre-quarti campo, il campo risulta lungo circa 17,8 Km. Ok. Fin qua ci siamo. Ora la domanda e': a che velocita media corrono Holly Hatton, Mark Lenders, Julian Ross e soci? Supponiamo che il campo venga percorso dai piu in forma 4/5 volte a partita: 90 min. (+ 5 di recupero) = 5700 sec (tempo di gioco) 17800 m (dimensione campo) x 4,5 volte a partita = 80100 m (spazio percorso) 80100 / 5700 = 14,052 m/s (velocità) Corrono cioè 100 metri in 7 secondi e 11. Circa 3 sec meno del record del mondo dei 100 metri piani (e il campo di Holly e Benji, si sa, non è in piano...). Questo è sufficiente a spiegare perché il povero Ross, malato di cuore, abbia difficoltà a concludere le partite. Avete presente quando Holly dalla sua area tira una mina che attraversa tutto il campo (di 17,8 km), buca la rete e sfonda il muro? In realtà la domanda è un'altra: ma in Giappone li fanno i controlli anti-doping? E ancora: che schema usano per occupare tutto il campo? L'1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1? In cosa consiste la tecnica del contropiede? Come fa l'anziano in difesa a chiamare il fuori gioco, spara un razzo in aria? L'arbitro gira per il campo in moto? E se investe qualcuno? E se gli finisce la miscela? E se estrae il cartellino rosso mentre va a 80 all'ora con tutti i poliziotti lì intorno? Per fermare il gioco cosa usa, la tromba? Per fermare un giocatore lontano gli spara? Alle gambe o altro "purché lo fermi"? Se un tifoso fa invasione di campo quando lo ripigliano? Se un giocatore resta a terra non rischia di creparci prima che qualcuno lo veda? Come si fa a fare ostruzione? A fine partita gira l'autobus per il campo o i giocatori se la devono cavare da soli? I guardalinee usano una vela per le segnalazioni? E quando devono mettersela tra le gambe per segnalare i rigori? Se uno segna, dall'altra parte del campo come lo scoprono? Se uno attraversa tutto il campo palla al piede, scarta tutti, scarta anche il portiere e giunto davanti alla porta vuota, dopo (stimiamo) un paio d'ore di corsa, la butta fuori cosa fa, si spara? Si butta sotto la moto dell'arbitro? E quando scopre che la partita era già finita da mezz'ora? E che c'era pure stato l'intervallo? Se in una partita c'è più di una rete passa alla storia? Se un giocatore chiamato dall'arbitro scappa via per non farsi riconoscere organizzano una squadra di ricerche? Se uno perde palla sotto porta dopo azione continuata (tre quarti d'ora) della squadra cosa gli fanno? Vivisezione? Quando devono fare un cambio mandano le frecce tricolore ad avvisare? Da quanti anelli sono composte le tribune? Gli ultra' si menano ugualmente o sono troppo lontani? Ma l' allenatore come fa a dare indicazioni ai giocatori, col megafono?Ma...

Lei, a detta delle sue fans, nelle canzoni metteva il cuore..non le importava di ciò che la gente pensava di lei, si comportava come un maschiaccio e ne era fiera. odiava le ragazze ricche, sempre alla moda, magrissime, che nelle canzoni vedevano solo soldi, che "ballavano" seguendo le coreografie..<br>  perchè parlo all'imperfetto? perchè tutto ciò era 3 anni fa. Se confronti una foto ai tempi di "skater boy" con una di "girlfriend" di adesso vedi che c'è differenza: il tema della canzone forse è lo stesso, ma il ritmo è diverso, "girlfriend" è più femminile; inoltre ha cambiato look, è più sofisticata, veste griffata, addirittura si è fatta le extencion rosa, un colore che prima disprezzava.<br>  Adesso, non credere che io sia una sua fan, ma leggo molte riviste che hanno parlato del suo cambiamento. Io comunque ascolto le sue canzoni e mi piacciono anche, solo che si è dimostrata incoerente verso le dichiarazioni che l'avevano resa così diversa e famosa, adesso sembra una delle tante ragazze che odiava. ma non sono nè contro di lei nè a favore, mi è totalmente indifferente, certo non credevo fosse così stonata...ciao!|`|rXk5hsXeaa	alcune canzoni non mi dispiacciono ma dal vivo non ha voce e mi sembra troppo artefatta, studiata a tavolino per essere sempre alla moda ma senza una sua originalità personale...|`|sNpQBeZXaa	è una xsona semplice cm noi sl ke lei si fa trascinare dalla musica io sono pro|`|xLLioPHIaa	A me piace! sia come ragazza sia come stile... sono pro!

Allora per passare il tempo decidono di organizzare una gara di barzellette. Per evitare i noiosi principianti, inseriscono una clausola crudele: il giudice unico sarà la tartaruga. Se la tartaruga non riderà il concorrente sarà decapitato. La scimmia è il primo coraggioso concorrente, e racconta una barzelletta sulle monache che fa ridere a crepapelle tutti i convenuti, meno la tartaruga. E la decapitano. Poi è la volta del leone, che racconta una barza sugli ubriachi. Di nuovo, tutti ridono tranne la tartaruga e il leone perde la testa. Poi arriva l’elefante. Quando arriva a metà della barzelletta, si sente la tartaruga che inizia a ridere a crepapelle mentre grida: - Hahahaha, quella delle monache era bellissima!!!|`|4d203d37bdf29036844f643afb5b6800aa	si è bella la sapevo anke io.Stella xte...baci Rosita*|`|65470c937935b53b5ba84857a7300deaaa	era la barzelletta preferita di un mio amico due estati fa, ce la raccontava ogni 5 minuti....e poi proprio ieri sera l ho raccontata a mia sorella...ho dovuto aspettare un paio di minuti per  la reazione,ma poi e′ andata subito ridendo a raccontarla a mio papa′...!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	eheheheh|`|PFPHBQOSaa	Carinaaaaaa!! <br>  Ascolta questa...<br>  Due coccinelle si incontrano al parco....<br>  -Ciao Cocci<br>  -Ciao Nella<br>  -Di un pò, ma tu hai capito perchè abbiamo tutti sti punti neri?<br>  -No!

k39bNUgeaa	Who is daniyah jackson?|`|97d50db6a834f02ae3b73b75b4c0a135aa	I hadn't heard of her until u asked the question. I looked it up, it is a tragic story. And it sounds a little messed up but I'm guessing that her story isn't well known because of the thing we don't like to talk about....race. The little girl is black and often the media doesn't put as much focus on African-American victims. I know many will argue with me but we all know the names of murdered caucasian children.|`|2272ee843f475a18e80ab4395dd15fd0aa	it's probably not published due to the fact the she is a 10 month old little girl, they probably want to have all there facts together before they publish anything concerning this tragic event. Think about it, she was a 10 month old left with the mothers evil boyfriend who then sexually assualted her, beat her, and even bite her on the chest

P8gGMlbIaa	It can vary greatly. Some are payed by the amount they make and for others it is a contract for what they can finish. This is why when at any comic or anime con you see artists working when not talking to fans. Their time is money to them, and if they can make a few extra bucks by a con appearance that just benefits them some what. They'd still have a dead line to finish stuff by.

Gosh that's a funny show.  There is another, the name evades me, it's about a female paster whose parish has quite the variety of characters.  (As Time Goes By is my all time favorite.)

(io speravo ke si mettesse cn sakura ù_ù)<br>  cmq a parte gli skerxi credo ke alla fine sasuke nn si metta cn nessuno...anxi è probabile ank ke muioia visto il suo andaxxo....<br>  <br>  poi nn so tt cio ke o detto sn solo teorie...nn resta ke aspettare di vdere le puntate....<br>  <br>  baci vavasaki|`|BQhuD40Paa	Concordo con jiyuu_92...i video su youtube sono falsi (ovvero sono montature di fanart realizzate dai fans), fino ad ora neanche in Giappone che sono più avanti Naruto si è messo insieme a Sakura o Hinata e penso che con Sakura nn possa mai succedere...cmq Sakura nn prova nulla per Naruto, solo affetto e tenerezza (se ti ricordi, nelle prime puntate lo odiava, mentre ora è rimasta colpita dalla sua determinazione, dal suo coraggio e toccata dal suo triste passato), per quanto riguarda Sasuke, penso che lei lo ami ancora solo che considerato il tradimento nn sia + sicura dei suoi sentimenti (bisogna anche considerare che Naruto è uno shonen e purtroppo c'è poco spazio per l'amore)...cmq Sasuke nn ha ancora sconfitto Itachi<br>  <br>  le uniche coppie confermate dall'autore sono Shikamaru-Temari e Asuma-Kurenai (peccato Kurenai la vedevo bene con Kakashi) cmq anch'io tifo per Hinata|`|S66WeOBDaa	in effetti non si capisce molto sui sentimenti di sakura verso naruto. le informazioni che ho trovato dicono che tra i due c'è un legame molto forte, ma non rivelano se si metteranno insieme. in quanto a sasuke non si lega a karin e non si sa se sasuke riesca ad uccidere itachi. comunque la serie non è ancora terminata, nemmeno in Giappone... quindi si può sperare... <br>  ps: anch'io tifo per Hinata|`|XUFx6NlVaa	No nn credo ke si mettono insieme. Nn ricordo di aver letto nnt di simile.|`|mCrxMmZGaa	Spero di si|`|qgZ2eYW3aa	nono invece sasuke si mette con sakura naruto si mette con hinata se vai su you tube vedi un kasino di video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=hzZYaqqYiSg" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=hzZYaqqYiS...</a><br>  <br>  ecco|`|qwxkb1NYaa	no si dovrebbe mettere mettere con Rock Lee .. ma sono solo voci....<br>  sasuke diventa un traditore e segue Orochimaru ... <br>  ucciderà Hitachi... ma non si mette con nessuno e neanche Naruto... peccato per Hinata...^_^<br>  per quello che riguarda Sakura e Rock Lee non sono sicura, invece per il resto dovrebbe essere sicuro, in Giappone sono molto avanti rispetto a noi ovviamente...|`|v6jLaB14aa	Su questa cosa purtroppo non si sa molto, iu rapporti tra Naruto e Sakura sono migliorati anche perchè 1: Sasukkia se n'è andato ormai(e nn so se torna buono, c'è chi dice di si e c'è chi dice che rimarrà cattivo per sempre)2: Sakura sta aprendo gli occhi e vede Naruto sotto un'altra luce.<br>  Ma io personalmente tifo per Hinata!! secondo me starebbe benissimo per Naruto...mi sta troppo simpatica!<br>  Sakura la vedrei bene con Sasuke, ma la vedo tanto come un'utopia...Tra lui e Karin nn credo ke nasca qualcosa, Sasuke è troppo impegnato a vendicare...( e poi spero che non si vada a mettere con quella li, preferisco ke se si deve mettere con qualcuna sia Sakura!!!tifo per questa coppia...W SasuXSaku e NaruXHina!!)<br>  <br>  SPOILER:<br>  <br>  Sasuke in seguito avrà uno scontro con Itachi. Praticamente succede che Itachi vuole uccidere Naruto(ma per fortuna nn ci riesce) e Sasuke si incacchia di brutto e impara il mangekyou sharingan, anche se nn forte come quello del fratello. L'esito dello scontro nn si sa, quindi nn si sa chi vince. <br>  Questa cosa l'ho letta su un sito e quello che ha scritto questa notizia l'ha presa da un sito su Naruto in giapponese quindi dovrebbe essere una cosa certa.<br>  Bakiss!!!^___^|`|bJjg4KImaa	Ahahahaha certe persone che rispondono alle domande in maniera così convinta mi fanno troppo ridere!! I casi sono 2: o vi inventate le cose di sana pianta o siete nella mente dell'autore. Perchè guarda un pò, io ho letto tutto fino all'ultimo capitolo uscito venerdì scorso e non c'è assolutamente traccia di una potenziale relazione di Naruto con Hinata (anche se è vero che Sakura e Naruto sono diventati molto più uniti) e poi Sai ingenuo? Ma stiamo leggendo lo stesso fumetto XD?? <br>  Ah aspettate, illuminazione ora capisco. Indigestione di fanfic vero?|`|yae3f4Sqaa	Sakura ha sempre fatto confusione prima gli piace sasuke poi rock lee adesso naruto poi di nuovo sasuke  e cosi via...<br>  <br>  comunque per me non succede niente infatti appena naruto vedrà che razza di tette sono cresciute a hinata le salta addosso  XD
3tVJ7U44aa	Realmente creo en Dios y en su misericordia.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Claro que existe la reencarnación y vidas pasadas. Y para muestra mi autor preferido en ese tema como lo es Briam Weiss un sicóloco estadounidense especialista en vidas pasadas y reencarnación quien ha demostrado en sus libros y conferencias que si existe la reencarnación  y que todos tenemos ese sexto sentido y los dejavu, algo que muchas personas lo tienen y no saben que es eso.<br>  <br>  Dejavu son situaciones que nos vienen a la mente de otras vidas en momentos como sitios donde nunca hemos estado y lo reconocemos,  personas que no habiamos visto antes y cuando las conocemos sentimos que la conociamos de antes y eso es DEJAVU o recuerdos de vidas pasadas y tal vez esa persona en otra vida  fue nuesta madre, o hermana, etc. <br>  <br>  De verdad que es super interezante investigar sobre ese tema, creo fervientemente en eso, ya que he vivido momentos tras momentos de dejavu y de recuerdos de sitios que de verdad a veces me asustaban, pero al investigar me di cuenta que no estaba errada. Creo en las almas gemelas y en la conexión entre ellas y acá cabe también la reencarnación.<br>  <br>  Creo en el karma y en las premoniciones, todos las tenemos pero unos las desarrollamos más que otros, tal vez por eso algunos no crean en esto. Es como decir, ver para creer, pero en este caso, es SENTIR PARA CREER, CAPTAR PARA  DEMOSTRAR, en fin, sería mucho escribir para hablar de este tema.<br>  <br>  Solo les aconsejo que lean los libros de Briam Weiss donde habla esplicitamente de este tema y demostraciones científicas en las regresiones a vidas pasadas que le realiza a sus pacientes.<br>  <br>  Saludos. bye.. te envio una estrellita me encanto tu pregunta. Y espero hagas mas referente a  este tema.|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	Pues un poco en la intuicion y el manejo energético, pero lo de las vidas pasadas se me hace un poco dudoso porque desde mis conocimientos de psicoanálisis existe un fenómeno del falso recuerdo, la mente cuando es muy joven tiene ciertos deseos que a veces integra como recuerdos por ser poco organizada, esto puede causar la impresion de haber vivido cosas que no han pasado, pero si que se han deseado.<br>  <br>  Suerte, me gusta tu nick.|`|9e11b1a5cd0c3f71c0e12883d0cfef0daa	Yo si creo, sobretodo creo en el karma, , siento que todos, de alguna u otra forma, tenermos un plan que cumplir en el cual nos enfrentaremos a situaciones que nos harán aprender , perdonar y no tener miedos, pero es complicado, no es fácil, pero estoy segura que todo valdrá la pena, claro que sí, hay que aprender a amar<br>  chao!!!!!!!!|`|D37QRmmfaa	yo si creo, me imagino que yo fui una gran criminal como, asaltante de banco, estafadora o algo asi, me llama mucho la atencion.|`|QoxE7AWtaa	Si, creo en la reencarnacion y en las vidas pasadas. El tema de las vidas pasadas es interesante porque a todos los i-dio-tas les dicen que han sido principes, princesas, reyes y lo peor es que se lo creen, nadie fue carbonero, aguatero, minero, vendedor de pescado en la francia del siglo XVII, etc.???? que paso con las vidas anteriores que solo han sobrevivido la realeza y los gobernantes?<br>  Yo creo que fui ladron o estafador, aunque no se bien en que epoca.|`|c1649823d7622a4ec0f4b38aec9513d6aa	-ojo el karma, las promoniciones dejavu, el sexto sentido, nda tiene que ver con la reencarnacion<br>  y realmente pienso que la reencarnacion o existe|`|44c15394698f825aecfa2897882240cdaa	Pues si creo en la reencarnación aunque sinceramente la idea esa de nacer una y otrra vez en este mundo no me gusta....<br>  <br>  Saludos!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  luisdel?ar?<br>  Visiten mi blog, música, música clásica, ópera,videos y más <br>  En mi perfil está el link... ya no puedo pegarlo porque me banearon otra vez... Error 999... bla bla bla....|`|EOMVAtsmaa	mmmm, un tema bastante complejo... ojala fuera posible, y seria mejor tener plena conciencia de eso, y tener presente en la mente las vidas vividas|`|KD8vwPl0aa	Si creo en el karma. Y tiene mucha lógica. Nos ayuda a entender por lo que pasamos en esta vida. A veces explica cosas como que un bebé o un ni?o peque?o fallezca, que es lo más duro para nuestro entendimiento. Curiosamente, el es un afortunado (en lo que se refiere a evolución), pues el ya ha vivido lo que necesitaba en esta vida. Su próxima vida será mejor. Estamos aquí para aprender, aprender y aprender. Y se aprende pasando por dificultades. El superarlas nos hace mejores y nos da un empujón en nuestra evolución. Yo no creo que exista un Dios todopoderoso. Nosotros mismos, en nuestra esencia somos ya budas y todos tenemos el potencial para conseguir lo que queramos. Sólo tenemos que creerlo y dejar de pedir a alguien externo que nos solucione la vida y si no lo hace quejarnos o maldecirlo. Sólo somos nosotros mismos los que tenemos que hacerlo. Yo soy creyente de una filosofía budista y he tomado responsabilidad de mi vida. Un beso|`|OmRKtAQRaa	la verdad que yo si creo en la reencarnacion y en la vidas pasadas por que yo tuve un sueno en donde yo me veia en otra parte y con otro nombre y logico otro fisico y pues la verdad si me vi tan real que desde ese dia me pregunto el por que de mi sieno aparte mmm consulte a alguien y me dijo de mi sueno sin contarselo yo pero no me dijo exactamentre lo que yo sone si no la interpretacion de mi sueno bueno y bueno el caso es que si creo <br>  suerte bye|`|Q8COMmV4aa	yo tambien creo en eso tipo o tipa|`|c08e1b1670502da5e7195daaedcd23c4aa	No, no  eres la unica persona.

Los que no creen , en cambio son muy pocos. <br>  <br>  Los católicos y ateos son muy pocos en comparación con las demás religiones. <br>  <br>  Piensa que incluso los judíos creen en la reencarnación, también los musulmanes, y las religiones orientales, donde son en la pura India unos ochocientos millónes de personas que creen en la reencarnación y el karma.<br>  <br>   Piensa además en los países vecinos a China, donde son cientos de millones de creyentes de la reencarnación y el karma; además en la misma China hay cientos de millones de creyentes en estas doctrinas.<br>  <br>  ???ASí  QUE  FORMAS  PARTE  DE  LA  ENORME  Y  ABRUMADORA  MAYORíA!!!.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, si quieren apoyarse en la ciencia para decidir que es lo verdadero y que es lo falso, resulta que los rosacruces inventaron las ciencias , la filosofía, y las artes. <br>  <br>  La mayoría de científicos y filósofos que conoce la historia de la humanidad han sido rosacruces. Allí pertenecieron los Avatares , tales como Tuthmosis III, Akhenaton, Zoroastro de Irán , quien , mil a?os después nació se reenacrnó en Jesús El Cristo, que nada tiene que ver con la Iglesia Católica Romana; Gautama El Buda, Todos Los Dalai Lamas perpetuan esas ense?anzas provenientes de La Escuela de Los Misterios de Egipto; cuya tradición la mantienen Los Rosacruces de AMORC , y Los Caballeros Templarios.|`|8R6fDeFxaa	A MI ME PARECE ABSURDO ESO DE LA REENCARNACION YO KREO KE TODOS TENEMOS 1 OPORTUNIDAD EN ESTA TIERRA ESTANDO EN VIDA, LO UNICO KE NOS DIFERENCIA DE LOS ANIMALES  ES KE NOSOTROS TENEMOS ESPIRITU Y ELLOS SOLO TIENEN ALMA ASI KE PUES HAY UNA GRAN DIFERENCIA.|`|A6nEmYyNaa	Da lila Lama dice que todos seremos reencarnados en un animal en nuestra segunda vida. Es por eso que los Lamas no matan a ningún animal porque creen que los insectos o algún animal o persona, podría ser alguno de sus ancestros. No todos estamos de acuerdo a su filosofía o creencia.<br>  LAS VIDAS PASADAS: Esta relacionado con el "Dayjavu" porque sucede que hay veces que estamos en un lugar y miramos todo y nos parece que ya hemos estado en ese lugar. Nos entra una gran duda.<br>  KARMA: Es  la ley de "NO HAGAS LO QUE NO QUIERES QUE TE HAGAN", o sea, si tu haces un mal alguna persona la ley del Karma te llegara algún día. O sea pagaras todo lo que hayas hecho en contra de otra persona. Esto se relaciona a la ley de DAR Y RECIBIR. Si das recibes. También a la buena energía. Si das buena energía te llegara buena energía. Todo tiene sentido.<br>  SEXTO SENTIDO: El sexto sentido es el desarrollo de y excelente adiestramiento de la mente, se conjuga con la percepción extra sensorial, la telequinesis y la ley de atracción. Acuerdate una cosa. El que domina la mente lo domina todo.|`|AA10546584	Ay, yo también creo y de hecho ?sabías que las personas que tienen lunares en los ojos son las más viejas?|`|OaSo7CrHaa	SIII...

Un acontecimiento para ella traumático –su primera menstruación ocurrida en las duchas, seguida de la burla impiadosa de sus compa?eras- desencadena también el desarrollo progresivo de sus poderes telequinéticos, que estallan en todo su esplendor al final de la película, con la realización del baile de fin de a?o.

Una tarde de invierno mientras viajaba por la carretera sufre un terrible accidente, del cual sale vivo de milagro, pero con ambas piernas rotas y muy lastimado. Despierta en la casa de Annie Wilkes, una enfermera fanática de Misery, personaje de muchas de las novelas de Paul. Al principio todo parece marchar bien pero poco a poco Paul descubrirá la obsesión que se apodera de su admiradora, que tratará de retenerlo todo lo posible, incomunicándolo y obligándolo a escribir una nueva novela sobre Misery que responda a varios interrogantes planteados en las obras anteriores. Finalmente y a duras penas, logra matarla y llamar a la policia.<br>  <br>  Rob Reiner adaptó muy bien esta obra al cine (1990)|`|A3qtDx9gaa	No se si esta basada en libro pero para mi es cementerio de animales y podes bajarla en ingles subtitulada de el ares|`|Bl9HjYdEaa	Sin duda el Resplandor, es un clásico, aunq no las he visto todas.

They probably are just clever sounding phrases strung together.<br>  That is actually a method of songwriting....strining clever phrases together for the way they sound, and not trying to tell a "story," like in a country and western song.<br>  It is used widely in progressive rock, and was first introduced by Bob Dylan in the mid 1960s.

mF9LRZOcaa	dunque<br>  prima stagione: La vita di Veronica Mars è cambiata definitivamente la notte in cui la sua migliore amica Lilly Kane è stata uccisa. Dopo quell'avvenimento, suo padre Keith Mars, lo sceriffo locale, è stato deriso ed obbligato a dimettersi dall'indignazione dell'opinione pubblica, sdegnata dal fatto che lui aveva, coraggiosamente, avanzato ipotesi sulla colpevolezza del padre di Lilly, milionario della città, presidente della Kane Software. Alcuni giorni prima dell'omicidio, Duncan Kane, fratello di Lilly e fidanzato di Veronica, aveva lasciato la ragazza senza un vero motivo. Tre mesi dopo l'omicidio, Veronica aveva partecipato ad un party organizzato da Shelly Pomroy (una compagna di scuola) per dimostrare di non temere le malignità che le venivano dette alle spalle; ma durante la festa, di cui non ha quasi alcun ricordo, è stata drogata e stuprata. Qualche tempo dopo la madre è scappata dalla città abbandonando figlia e marito.<br>  <br>  Nonostante tutti questi avvenimenti negativi che le sono capitati, e nonostante l'essere ostracizzata dai suoi compagni di scuola, in quanto accusata di essersi messa dalla parte del padre e quindi contro la comunità, Veronica ora lo aiuta con la sua nuova agenzia investigativa, trasformando la sua angoscia in una spinta positiva, è determinata a smascherare, metter da parte e sminuire tutti quelli che le bloccano la strada. Trovando un equilibrio tra i compiti di matematica a casa e segreti non ancora scoperti, si impegna a risolvere misteri che le hanno rovinato la vita l'anno precedente.<br>  <br>  La prima stagione verte sulle missioni di Veronica per scoprire il vero assassino di Lilly, che si rivela essere il padre di Logan Echools, ovvero il famossimo attore Aaron Echools.<br>  <br>  seconda stagione: Aaron torna in libertà perchè vince la causa in tribunale (siccome ricco e famoso viene ritenuto non colpevole). Veronica continua la sua vita in modo tranquillo e nella normalità assoluta. Ha un avvicinamento tra i ricchi della città dai quali si era staccata dopo lo scandalo del padre. Torna insieme a Duncan.<br>  Durante una gita scolastica cade in un precipizio il pullman scolastico. Fortunatamente Veronica non è a bordo e si salva, come anche i "ricchi" che decisero di tornare in limousine (Duncan compreso).<br>  L'unica sopravvisuta è Meg, ex di Duncan e amica di Veronica. Meg è però in fin di vita. Si scopre che è in cinta e il padre è proprio Duncan. Riescono a salvare il banbino ma Meg muore. Duncan prende suo figlio e scappa con l'aiuto di Veronica che lascia andare l'amore della sua vita via per sempre. <br>  Veronica durante la seconda serie risolve piccoli misteri nel suo liceo, ma la prova più grnade è scoprire il colpevole del disastro del pullman, che si scopre essere stato premeditato (trovano una bomba nel veicolo).<br>  <br>  Nell'ultima puntata si scopre che il colpevole è Cassidy Casablanca, un giovane dell'età di Veronica che uccide i suoi compagni perkè tra quelli si trovavano due testimoni di un maltrattamento che aveva subito anni prima. Cassidy si uccide buttandosi giù da un tetto, allo stesso tempo anche Aaron Echool viene ucciso. Veronica scopre che Cassidy l'aveva stuprata in quella festa della prima serie. <br>  Logan si riconcilia con Veronica e si mettono insieme.<br>  Dopo il giorno del diploma la madre di Cassidy decide di rivolgersi ai Mars per la riconciliazione del marito (che era scappato) e il padre di Veronica accetta l'incarico che gli procura un sacco di soldi. <br>  E' proprio l'incarico che si vede nella seconda o terza puntata (l'uomo uccide la moglie e ferisce lievemente Mars  che si fa tutto il deserto a piedi per raggiungere una stazione d ipolizia e raccontare l'accaduto, poi l'uomo viene a sua volta ucciso da un'altra persona). <br>  <br>  Veronica inizia nella terza  serie a frequentare il college e anche in questo i misteri non mancano e la tengono occupata. Il resto lo sai! buona visione!!<br>  <br>  || scusa se alcune parti sono molto accorciate e nn si capiscono molto ma i particolari sn davvero troppi!!! ti consiglio di iniziare a scaricarti qualcosina da emule!!|||`|2AhOpY49aa	vedo che il riassunto te l'hanno già fatto.... io volevo semplicemente avvertirti nel caso tu avessi SKY, che ogni martedì alle 21:00 su Fox (canale 110) stanno trasmettendo la seconda serie....|`|7MbWzrdlaa	Sono troppe le puntate prima!..vai su un motore di ricerca e cerca: "riasuunto puntate veronica mars"..!!..xD|`|mq10soh0aa	sì è vero è carinissimo!<br>  fino ad ora la serie si è basata sulla sua vita da detective al liceo (hai presente il posto di lavoro che faceva oggi Wivil? ecco lei l'ha fatto per 2 anni) ed ha dovuto affrontare in tutte e due le seriedei misteri intricatissimi:<br>  1. la morte della migliore amica, fidanzata di logan e sorella del vecchio ragazzo di lei<br>  2.

Trovando un equilibrio tra i compiti di matematica a casa e segreti non ancora scoperti, si impegna a risolvere misteri che le hanno rovinato la vita l'anno precedente.<br>  La prima stagione verte sulle missioni di Veronica per scoprire il vero assassino di Lilly. Alla fine della stagione, questo e altri misteri, che circondano la sua vita, lentamente saranno risolti;: infatti lilly è stata uccisa da Aaron Echolls suo amante siccome aveva dei videi compromettenti.<br>  <br>  2 SERIE.. <br>  Veronica ha passato un’estate decisamente intensa, ma ora tutto sembra andare per il meglio: Wallace è sempre accanto a lei, ha un lavoro normale, ha finalmente un fidanzato che non deve tenere segreto, la sua reputazione sta migliorando e l’assassino di Lilly è stato assicurato alla giustizia. La scuola è appena cominciata e per Veronica è già arrivato un nuovo mistero da risolvere: i migliori atleti della Neptune High, tra i quali Wallace e Meg, sono risultati positivi ai test antidroga; sono stati, quindi, espulsi da tutte le attività sportive. Ma a Neptune niente succede per caso... Tutta Neptune è sconvolta per la sciagura dello scuolabus, in cui sono morti sei studenti, l’insegnante e l’autista. Mentre lo sceriffo Lamb concentra le sue indagini su quest’ultimo, pensando che l’uomo si sia suicidato provocando l’incidente, Veronica decide di aiutare Jessie, la figlia dell’autista, a dimostrare che il padre non si è ucciso di proposito. Nel frattempo Wallace, per fare colpo su Jackie, una nuova studentessa, si offre di aiutarla in una piccola indagine, e il ragazzo si rivela un degno collega di Veronica...Un uomo è trovato privo di vita sulla spiaggia, sulla sua mano c’è scritto Veronica Mars. La ragazza viene subito fermata ed interrogata dallo sceriffo, che sospetta un suo coinvolgimento nella morte dell’uomo, un pregiudicato di nome David Curly Moran; Veronica, quindi, comincia ad indagare su Curly, cercando di capire cosa lo lega a lei e scoprirà di avere un amico in comune. Mentre Keith ed Alicia si godono una romantica vacanza a Chicago, Veronica viene ingaggiata da Beaver per scoprire se la sua matrigna sta tradendo suo marito e se è solo un’avventuriera in cerca di un facoltoso pollo da spennare. Ma Kendall Casablancas non è la sola a nascondere qualcosa..Veronica accetta un caso di nascosto da suo padre; decide, infatti di aiutare una ragazza, Julie, ad indagare sul suo fidanzato. Julie, che è molto ricca, vuole scoprire se l’uomo è il classico avventuriero interessato ai suoi soldi oppure se la ama per quella che è veramente. Questa indagine porta Veronica a pensare anche alla sua relazione con Duncan: le sono sorti alcuni dubbi su di lui, dopo aver scoperto che il ragazzo va tutti i giorni all’ospedale a vegliare Meg, ancora in coma. Nel frattempo Alicia chiede a Keith aiuto per liberarsi di un suo antico fidanzato che la molesta. Keith sorveglia l’uomo ed indaga su di lui, ma sarà lo sceriffo Lamb a rivelargli la sua vera identità...L’arrivo di Nathan sconvolge la vita di casa Fennel: Alica e Keith hanno un’accesa discussione sul modo in cui conducono le rispettive vite, mentre Wallace è sconvolto da quello che ha scoperto sul proprio passato. Il ragazzo così cerca conforto in Veronica, che per tirarlo su lo candida a re del ballo della scuola. Anche Jackie ha bisogno di lei: qualcuno le ha rubato la carta di credito e la ragazza vuole trovare il colpevole. L’indagine porta Veronica in contatto con una sedicente medium; per smascherala, quindi, la ragazza finge di dover comunicare con un falso parente defunto, ma la donna la stupisce riferendole un messaggio dall’aldilà di un’altra persona a lei molto vicina... Il passato ritorna per tutti: Veronica riceve l’inaspettata visita di Abel Koontz, ormai in fin di vita, che le chiede aiuto per trovare sua figlia Amelia, scomparsa nel nulla. Le indagini portano Veronica di nuovo a contatto con Clarence Wiedman, il capo della sicurezza della Kane Software, ma questa volta sarà costretto a collaborare, suo malgrado, con la ragazza. Nel frattempo, anche per lo sceriffo Lamb è il momento di ritornare su un caso archiviato: la comparsa di un testimone chiave, gli permette di riaprire le indagini sulla morte di Felix, facendo arrestare nuovamente Logan. Mentre il ragazzo è in cella in attesa di conoscere il suo destino, si ritrova faccia a faccia con il suo passato... Kendall Casablancas scopre che, dopo la fuga di suo marito, non solo è costretta ad accudire i suoi figliastri, ma, come se non bastasse, Dick Senior non le ha lasciato nemmeno un soldo; la donna, quindi, deve rimettersi al lavoro, facendo quello che sa fare meglio. Meg è ancora in coma, ma le sue e-mail portano alla luce un nuovo mistero, sepolto in una facoltosa famiglia di Neptune; Duncan, infatti, dopo aver letto alcuni messaggi della ragazza trovati sul suo pc, chiede aiuto a Veronica per trovare i colpevoli e per salvare un innocente. Ma la giovane detective deve indagare anche per conto di Logan, che forse è vittima di un complotto... Keith viene assunto dai genitori di un ragazzo, Marcos Oliveras, morto nella tragedia dello scuolabus: da quando il figlio è morto, qualcuno li sta tormentando con messaggi anonimi che alludono all’incidente o, addirittura, con registrazioni della voce del ragazzo. Veronica, quindi, aiuta il padre cercando di scoprire qualcosa su Marcos, ma nessuno a scuola sembra conoscerlo, anche se, in realtà, conduceva, con uno pseudonimo, una trasmissione radiofonica molto seguita dagli studenti della Neptune High. Con l’aiuto di Mac, e di un po’ di tecnologia, Veronica riesce comunque a risalire al colpevole. Nel frattempo, però, la ragazza continua le indagini sull’omicidio di Felix e le sue ricerche metteranno in grave pericolo non solo lei stessa, ma anche Logan...  Il vicepreside Clemmons scopre che Veronica è in possesso delle chiavi degli uffici scolastici; come punizione la ragazza deve rimettere in ordine gli archivi studenteschi, ma, mentre è al lavoro trova la scheda permanente di sua madre, scoprendo anche che era stata sospesa per aver sparlato di un’altra studentessa. Veronica, quindi, chiedendosi che tipo fosse Lianne Reynolds ai tempi del liceo, decide di indagare sugli avvenimenti di venticinque anni prima che hanno portato alla sospensione di sua madre. Nel frattempo Trina Echolls, la sorella di Logan, torna in città per mettere in scena uno spettacolo studentesco e la ragazza sarà fondamentale per scoprire la verità su Lianne. Ma in una camera dell’ospedale c’è una rivelazione ben più scioccante che attende Veronica...  Niente riposo per la famiglia Mars, nemmeno durante le tanto sospirate vacanze di Natale. Keith, infatti, viene assunto dal sindaco per indagare su un furto al dipartimento di polizia: le prove più schiaccianti sull’omicidio di Lilly Kane sono state rubate. Nel frattempo Veronica viene convocata come membro di una giuria popolare; la ragazza, infatti, è stata chiamata a discutere un caso di aggressione, che si rivelerà più complicato del previsto, ma che Veronica saprà brillantemente risolvere. L’anno sta per finire, ma prima di capodanno, ci saranno ancora sorprese nella sua vita: qualcuno che torna e qualcuno che se ne va... Il rapporto tra Veronica e Duncan, già incrinato da tempo, va in pezzi dopo la nascita della bambina di Meg; il ragazzo, infatti, non volendo lasciare la figlia in mano ai dispotici nonni materni, la rapisce, scomparendo nel nulla. Veronica è quindi costretta ad aiutare lo sceriffo e l’FBI, alla disperata ricerca del giovane padre in fuga, ma forse Duncan è molto più scaltro di quanto non sembri e riesce a far perdere le sue tracce. Nel frattempo, Logan e Weevil continuano le indagini sulla morte di Felix, cercando di capire quale membro dei PCH, la banda dei motociclisti, è in combutta con i temibili Fitzpatrick. Le loro ricerche sembrano non portare a niente, finché Weevil scopre, per caso, il segreto di Felix...|`|tAEgvYsdaa	io lo sto seguendo per la seconda volta<br>  questa è la terza stagione ed è la prima volta che la trasmettono su italia 1<br>  cavolo peccato che non l'hai visto<br>  la 1 serie è stata la più bella<br>  farti il succo è veramente difficile perchè ogni episodio è ricco ,mica come beautiful che per montare due scene ci vogliono mesi<br>  cmq se vai sul sito le trovi le informazioni<br>  ma se vuoi un consiglio non sbirciare vedrai che tra qualche annetto massimo le riproporrano di nuovo tutte e tre le serie|`|UiPZroX3aa	trpp lunga da spiegare!!<br>  <br>  prova qui:<br>  <a href="http://www.veronicamars.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.veronicamars.it/</a><br>  io ho visto tutta la prima e la sec stagione ma ora nn posso xk ho tre rientri a sqola (tragediaaa)... ciauu|`|kitGI5lXaa	è la terza stagione,è iniziata da lunedi(con il primo giorno di college), io oggi purtroppo nn l'ho vista,comunaue la seguo da 2o3 settimane circa, quindi nn tanto,ma mi piace un casino anche a me!|`|mSsdmaP7aa	questa è la terza stagione...e quello di oggi era il 3 episodio...per i riassunti delle puntate guarda su wikipedia o www.veronicamars.it..|`|udpKmm4Baa	si qst è la terza stagione, x sapere tutto sulle serie precedenti visita il sito www.veronicamars.it!ciaooo

f8417abc206240fd9a1509abff5418eeaa	tecnicamente:<br>  è il ritorno alle origini del Rock...negli anni '70 l'Hard Rock (Led Zeppelin,Deep Purple) era ormai il principale genere musicale in circolazione...esso derivava dal Rock (Beatles, Rolling Stones,Doors) della seconda metà dei 60s dove invece tutto era più facile e la tecnica richiesta era di gran lunga inferiore...<br>  L'Hard Rock dunque aveva 2 grandi elementi che lo caratterizzavano: la voce melodiosa e la chitarra elettrica piena di virtuosismi e assoli mozzafiato! Come ben sappiamo però la musica si evolve continuamente e anche dall'Hard Rock escono dei generi:<br>   il Glam Rock (GNR,Motley Crue) che aumenta a dismisura l'elemento voce e potenzia l'elemento chitarra<br>  il Metal (Metallica,Iron Maiden,Judas Priest) che perde del tutto la voce ma migliora decisamente lo stile della chitarra<br>  il Punk (Sex Pistols,Clash,Ramones) che elimina completamente la chitarra raffinata per sostituirla a una pesante,dura a volte ripetitiva e distrugge il canto limitandosi ad urlare a squarciagola...<br>  <br>  realmente:<br>  il punk dunque non è tecnica dato che ogni principiante chitarrista saprebbe suonare God Save The Queen e ogni barbone saprebbe "cantare" Anarchy in the UK...<br>  il punk oltre a tornare alle origini strumentalmente torna agli anni 60 anche per i testi delle canzoni...non più storie strane di scale per il paradiso ma inni di protesta generazionali! il Punk distrugge (o mira a distruggere) con un album tutto quello che l'uomo ha costruito a partire dalla società stessa...il Punk rifiuta la commercializzazione,il perbenismo,le istituzioni, l'ipocrisia e ogni sorta di ingiustizia..e per farlo mira all'Anarchia e alla noncuranza di ogni legge...queste persone vengono viste dalla gente come delinquenti,drogati o nella migliore delle ipotesi semplicemente come pazzi!<br>  <br>  la cosa difficile nel rispondere alla tua domanda è che non esiste UNA PERSONA PUNK...esiste il truzzo che si riconosce dall'abbigliamento,esiste l'EMO,esiste la Bimbaminkia...molte persone si limitano ad ascoltare il Punk senza capirlo e pensano (come il tizio sopra di me) che essere Punk sia semplicemente essere diverso e vestirsi alla kazzo! questo cari amici è essere Poser,essere persone che essendo state rifiutate dalla società fingono di rifiutare la società! essere Punk non si vede dai vestiti nè dalle volte in cui ti fai la doccia in una settimana, ma si vede da quello che credi e quello che sei!<br>  ovviamente non lo leggerai tutto ma va bè diciamo che non sapevo cosa fare e mi sono sbizzarito...ciao|`|ogmaXIW2aa	i ma questo non puoi domandarlo a chiunque, una risposta giusto te la pò dare solo un punk vero, e cmq da speigare è troppo lungo e poi se il punk non lo ami davvero quella risposta se pur giusta non avrà mai senso x te (te in generale)|`|Z1gZlYhaaa	Il punk x me e uno stile nn solo come musica come vita modo di vestirsi modo di fare :D:D<br>  <br>  xro voglio sentire la tua fammi sapere un saluto :D:D<br>  <br>  ciauuuuuu|`|jXVHWETnaa	Ehm... la risposta del Gurzo è talmente perfetta che non so cosa aggiungere!<br>  Posso dire che il punk è fottersene in un mondo in cui tutto è basato su delle stronzate!

Potremmo stare qui ore a parlare su cosa è punk. Il pensiero punk nasce come disprezzo per tutto quello che va bene e tutte le persone famose, pseudo-fighe (bill kaulitz). Il pensiero nichilista prende anche una grande parte nel punk, ossia negare tutte le abilità in sè stessi, e andare fieri dei propri insuccessi. I sex pistols non cantavano mica di essere dei figoni o canzoni d'amore, no, loro dicevano di essere falliti e ne andavano fieri! Sai cosa c'era scritto dietro al loro unico album? "THIS IS CRAP!" Ecco cosa c'era scritto!! I NOFX sono uno degli unici gruppi rimasti con un po' di dignita punk, e sai perchè? Perchè dopo un po' di tempo MTV si è accorta che esistono e fanno bella musica, e allora ha pensato "però, sti NOFX! Potremmo mandare i loro video sul nostro canale" e sai i NOFX cosa hanno risposto? "A CALCI NEL KULO ANDIAMO NEL VOSTRO KAZZO DI CANALE, FALLITI!!!" Una volta hanno premiato Fat Mike, Leader dei NOFX per gli MTV sport awards, o roba del genere, e quando gli hanno dato la coppa sai cosa ha fatto? La gettata in terra e l'ha rotta, poi ha detto "Oh, ***** MTV! Ahahah" e lo hanno cacciato. QUESTO è punk, ripudiare la società, credere in ciò che fai e non venderti per essere omologato come tutti i truzzetti e i bimbiminkia del kazzo! Good charlotte, finley, sum41, avril lavigne, simple plan, green day, fall out boy, linkin park, ecc. negano ogni abilità in sè stessi? Non mi pare... sono molto affezionati a MTV! E poi tutti i gruppi citati devono il loro successo in gran parte al loro aspetto fisico, quindi sanno di essere dei fighetti... questo non è nichilismo, questo non è punk, questo è MERCHANDISING!!! Un vero punk se ne fregherebbe di come è fisicamente!!! I veri punk non si vestono dolce e gabbana, si vestono come capita!!! Si vestono ALLA KAZZO DI CANE!!! Se vuoi vestirti punk scegliti i vestiti a caso. QUESTO è punk.

I6nopGJJaa	Orquestación significa decidir cuales instrumentos o voces ejecutarán lo concebido en el arreglo. Es decidir si determinada parte estará a cargo de los bandoneones, o de los violines o de todos juntos. Si un pasaje será al unísono o a voces separadas. La orquestación también tiene como finalidad lograr el equilibrio del conjunto, el buen dise?o y terminación de la pieza musical.<br>  Ejemplo: Hiciste una cancion (La letra solamente) y quieres buscarle una tonada pero no sabes hacerlo le entregas la letra a un arreglista o director de orquesta para que la prepare para cada instrumento ya sea de una banda, un solista o la orquesta sinfonica propiamente dicha y hace todo lo mencionado anteriormente.<br>  Asi que vamos si tienes chance ha estudiar a practicar uno o varios instrumentos musicales incluyendo tu voz (canto) y VIVA LA MUSICA! Buena suerte muy melodiosamente|`|3392c828e1e0467d2673351c7e6d4aeeaa	La orquestacion:<br>  Conjunto de instrumentos musicales y de los músicos que los tocan. En ella aparecen los instrumentos de cuerda con arco de la familia del violín, a los que se a?aden las maderas, los metales y los instrumentos de percusión. La palabra orquesta originariamente hacía referencia a la parte de los antiguos teatros griegos que estaba entre el escenario y el público y que ocupaban los bailarines e instrumentistas. En un teatro moderno, la parte del auditorio reservada a los músicos se llama foso orquestal. En la orquesta hay varias secciones, en cada cual, hay un tipo de instrumento:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Sección de cuerdas: Se divide en cinco partes: primeros violines, segundos violines, violas, violonchelos y los contrabajos.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Secciones de maderas: Constituyen del 10 al 20% de la orquesta. La forman: clarinetes, oboes, flautas y los fagotes.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Sección de metales: También constituye entre un 10% al 20%. La forman: tubas, trompas, trompetas y los trombones.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Sección de percusión: Constituye aproximadamente un 10% de la orquesta. La forman: tambores, triángulos, timbales y los platillos.<br>      *<br>  <br>        La mayoría de las orquestas tienen, además de los de antes, un arpa y un piano. <br>  Colocación en el escenario<br>  <br>  La colocación de los asientos de la orquesta la determina el director, que está al frente de la orquesta durante las actuaciones. Pero normalmente están colocados así:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Los primeros y segundos violines suelen situarse a la izquierda del director.<br>      *<br>  <br>        A la derecha se sitúan las violas, violonchelos y contrabajos.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Las maderas y metales están frente al director (detrás de las cuerdas).<br>      *<br>  <br>        La percusión está en la parte de atrás<br>  <br>  Número de instrumentos por cada sección<br>  <br>  - La sección de maderas tiene: dos flautas, dos oboes, dos clarinetes y dos fagotes.<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        La sección de metales tiene: cuatro trompas, tres trompetas, tres trombones y una tuba.<br>      *<br>  <br>        La sección de la percusión cuenta con: timbales, un tambor lateral, un bombo, platillos y un triángulo.<br>  <br>  Tipos de orquestas<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        De ballet: Forman parte de las actuaciones teatrales y están sentadas en el foso orquestal de la sala.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Sinfónicas: Interpreta sinfonías, conciertos y otras músicas de concierto, y normalmente se sitúa sobre el escenario.<br>      *<br>  <br>        De ópera: También forman parte de las actuaciones teatrales.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Orquesta de cámara: Suele tener menos de 25 músicos en sus filas.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Orquesta de cuerdas: Tiene la sección de cuerdas habitual de la orquesta, pero no tiene instrumentos de viento o de percusión.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orquestal" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orquestal</a>

Pero hay una importante cantidad de motivos que nadie más que los que la viven pueden conocer. El sibarita Miguel Brascó, el poeta Fernando Noy, el escritor Alberto Laiseca y el actor Daniel Aráoz cuentan los secretos de los barrios que ni los expertos en turismo podrían conocer. Daniela Pasik 2007-08-12 04:40:53Si hay una revista sobre turismo a la que nada se le puede discutir, ésa es Condé Nast. Visitan destinos sin la chapa del investigador que acepta mimos a cambio de recomendaciones y relatan con objetividad lo bueno y lo malo de cada lugar. En su edición de septiembre se ocupan de Argentina y dan sus “25 motivos para ir a Buenos Aires”. No fallan, pero les falta ese qué-sé-yo que sólo un poeta, un sibarita, un escritor un actor, o un habitante-amante de los 100 barrios porte?os pueden conocer. <br>  <br>  Dicen que “el tango es el soundtrack de Buenos Aires”, como motivo número uno del inventario, y siguen con Palermo Soho, “el vecindario más en boga de la Ciudad”. Enumeran sus bares y recomiendan cócteles, pero les faltó saber lo que sabe Daniel Aráoz, vecino del barrio, que asegura: “Es genial ver tanta gente de todo el mundo por acá, pero a lo de Pedro, mi parrilla de cabecera, no llegan los turistas. Se conserva igual desde siempre. El mismo hace el asado y te lo sirve; es una persona muy bella. Ni sue?en con que les diga dónde queda... Para encontrarlo hay que saber recorrer este Soho maravilloso”. <br>  <br>  El número tres de Condé Nast es choripán, pero recomiendan degustar el sándwich criollo en lo de Francis Mallmann o “a orillas del Río de la Plata”: cualquier porte?o de ley está enterado de que en ningún lugar saben mejor que en Costanera Sur, específicamente, y que si uno se harta del chorizo puede pasarse sin problemas al vacipán o, por qué no, al morcipán. <br>  <br>  sigue<br>  <br>  <br>  Cuarto puesto para el Faena Hotel + Universe, quinto para los cafetines en general, sexto para las zapaterías (las casas que arreglan calzado, no las que lo venden) y séptimo para la flor de metal de Figueroa Alcorta. Indiscutible, como el fútbol, el cementerio de la Recoleta, el MALBA, el asado y el polo, que siguen en la lista. Pero no se encuentra por ningún lado Pedro 94, la pescadería que hay en Pedro Goyena y Senillosa que Miguel Brascó cataloga como “excepcional”: tiene sólo ocho mesas y “hay que ir a las ocho menos cuarto indefectiblemente porque a las menos cinco ya se llenó y no hay reservas”, avisa. <br>  <br>  San Telmo los domingos a la tarde y la ropa de cuero no podían faltar entre las razones, y la librería de El Ateneo tiene bien ganado su lugar, ya que el Colón está cerrado por reparaciones. El vino, los caballos, el Mercado de Liniers, el paisaje pampeano (“como un mar verde que rodea la Ciudad”), los bifes y los hoteles boutique dejan en claro que recomiendan como para todos los gustos. Aunque no estaría jamás en este recorrido previsto el lugar favorito del escritor Alberto Laiseca, que dice: “Mi casa es mágica y ninguna guía de viajes la conoce, pero no la citen porque no quiero que se me llene de gente... a menos que sean chicas desnudas”. <br>  <br>  La estación de tren de Retiro, los paseos por los shoppings, el Alvear Palace Hotel y el mate son las recomendaciones número 22, 23, 24 y 25, pero el poeta Fernando Noy hace un perfecto agregado: “El Abasto es el pulmón de Buenos Aires porque tiene ese modernismo vomitable, aunque manteniendo su marginalidad. Es como una mezquita profanada, en la que todo es for export, y sin embargo ahí nomás, a dos cuadras, están todas las divas locas, las travestis, el puterío y la casa en donde vivió Batato Barea, que hoy es un museo”.<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  Esta edición | Ultimo Momento| Política | Economía | Cultura | Sociedad | Internacional | Deportes | Espectáculos | Columnistas Noticias | Fortuna | Caras | Hombre | Luz | Mía | Semana | Semanario | Look <br>  SuperCampo | WeekEnd | Parabrisas | Joker/Crucigrama <br>  Página de inicio | Contáctenos| Publicidad | Privacidad | Quiénes somos | Fundación Perfil | Fideicomiso<br>  ?

Soy Argentino y vivo en Buenos Aires, me sumo a la propuesta anterior de que las argentinas son muy bonitas, igual te aclaro que no todas se mueren por el asento espa?ol si no lo acompa?as con algo de facha.. jajaj!!!! De todas formas son mas de 10 las razones para conocer buenos aires, pero como en todas las grandes ciudades, existen lugares muy malos, busca asesoramiento turistico y te vas a sorprender, ademas si estas por la provincia conoce algo como mar del plata u otra costa, que son muy bonitas aunque no son comparables con las espa?olas.<br>  Saludos!!|`|Yn1Ba8uiaa	*los shoping<br>  *la cancha de boca junior o river pate<br>  *los teatros<br>  *los restaurantes<br>  *la playa si es mar del plata<br>  *podes encontrarte con famosos de la tele<br>  *el cine<br>  *la tecnologia,hay muchas cosas que en otros lugares no hay<br>  *es la ciudad mas rica de argentina, podes visitar lindos lugares<br>  *digamos que tenes de todo un poco|`|o40SvU2Yaa	te podria dar cientos de motivos pero ahi van un par, es un pais hermoso y tiene los lugares mas lindos del mundo, y si las mujeres mas lindas, son las argentinas!!!!
AA11905831	In the original story, Grendal was a dragon.   His mother was a blob thing or something.  You know, there is a book called Beowulf with the original story.  Check it out.|`|7dcaaafa6aef148c9cc745e57a330623aa	Gods the movie sucked so bad compared to the actual story.  Why did there have to be that much unneeded nudity anyway?<br>  <br>  But seriously.  Grendel's mom as Angelina Jolie?  Come on... that explains a lot.  <br>  <br>  Having Grendel look that horrid was just so the viewer would have no sympathy for him.  I had a lot of sympathy for Grendel when reading Beowulf for many reasons, and I understood why Grendel's mom acted that way, too.  I hated Beowulf--the person--to be frank.
