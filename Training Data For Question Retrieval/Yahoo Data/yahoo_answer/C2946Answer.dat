It deals with how the countries across the world interact and the way culture, language, ideas, etc travel from one area to another much more quickly now as a result of technological and societal advances and such.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia says<br>  Globalization (globalisation) in its literal sense is the process of transformation of local or regional phenomena into global ones.

It is just that a lot of us don't believe that it is entirely man made especially since we have only been taking good data for the last 50 years.

Life is all so intertwined and so very intrinsic. All human and animal life breathe out carbon dioxide taken in by the flora and the fauna so that they can live. And, then, our wonderful green friends breathing in our carbons and breathing out their oxygen so that we may survive as well. The balance and the beauty of this natural dance is staggeringly simple to understand and, yet, apparently tremendously difficult to maintain. On this day, do something special and green with the intention attached that your one effort will add to those of everyone else and that all of us together will make a difference. And will bring balance back to the planet. Recycle something you normally would cavalierly throw away. Turn off the lights. Turn off the water. Don't leave it running to warm up before you take your shower. Don't leave it running while you brush your teeth. Hang your clothes outside to dry, but do remember that Feng Shui says if you leave them out overnight you are risking potential negative energies attaching themselves to your shorts. Rather try to get them off the line and in the house before the Sun goes down. Reuse your paper towels and wash your windows with old newspaper. There are a million small ways to make one gigantic difference. Do something proactive today. Do something polaractive today. You do make a difference. You can save the world.

As for not believing in it, that's not the issue either.  The issue is whether the current set of predictions based on somewhat dubious models and assumptions is correct, what the actual impact manmade contributions adds to whatever trends the models come up with, and whether or not the proposed "fixes" will actually accomplish anything other than to worsen the situation or to enrich a certain set of investors in the various schemes.<br>  <br>  Show me an actual causal connection between manmade factors and whatever trend we happen to be in, and I'll buy doing something more than I already do.|`|buHzPMHZaa	You kids are funny. 'Proof'' isn't a word used in science, except in cases where it means to review something. <br>   <br>         There's a fine answer here already, so I'll just say this. The debate is far from over among top scientists. Among lower-tier community-college scientists, it might be a done deal, but the subject is being scrutinized, and the top minds are asking for a little more time and a little precautionary action, just as was done with CFC's 15 years ago. By using economic indicators and slow changes to policy, gradual improvements that don't impoverish user groups can be introduced without stifling innovation or taking food out of hungry mouths. <br>  <br>   You need to be patient and educate yourself. This issue isn't merely scientific, but rather, requires multidisciplinary problem-solving until such a time as the evidence is conclusive.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	I don't buy man made global warming because where I live thousands of years ago there used to be glaciers. The glaciers receded, and THEN the industrial revolution happened. So it it's man (and only man) that causes global warming, how did the glaciers receded? Whenever I ask this question of global warming enthusiasts they just roll their eyes or say you don't know science. <br>  <br>  Well, what is the answer then? But I suppose I should just have faith in a "documentary" with cartoons of polar bears drowning instead of the scientific method which would tell us that 50 years of sample data isn't enough to predict the entire global history. <br>  <br>  I am a conservationist. I recycle and I turn off the lights when I leave a room. I believe in preserving our resources, but I'm not arrogant enough to believe that I've just saved the planet by doing so. <br>  <br>  And the argument of "Well it could happen so we should do something about it" is also fallacious. Space aliens could come down to destroy the Earth too. I propose that we build a series of super lazes designed to shoot them down.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	A bit off topic, but what really bugs me is when GISS makes a minor correction to their global temperature data, the deniers jump all over it talking about fraud and conspiracy theories.  UAH had the sign of the temperature change wrong, claiming the atmosphere was cooling, and Christy was even interviewed in the Great Global Warming Swindle talking about this.  Yet deniers happily cite UAH and Spencer and Christy while constantly disparaging Hansen and GISS.  It's extremely two-faced.<br>  <br>  As for Spencer and Christy themselves, I don't think their past errors make them unreliable sources.  I think their claims need to be evaluated on the basis of their scientific accuracy.  I do think they would really love for AGW to be wrong, because they've based their reputations on it.  However, I do appreciate that Christy at least does not dispute that the planet is warming and humans are causing it.<br>  <br>  In short, I don't think their past errors make them unreliable sources, but I do think their more recent research and conclusions don't hold up well to scrutiny either.  For example:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtGAcQrqedz_oXydfE1_1HUjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227151306AAfOK4V">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApgP6r0Gm0I5AnvFFGjNpffsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303103722AAReY2z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4090lGkMaa	Christy more so than Spencer. Christy agrees with AGW theory, helped with the AGU position statement, he just doesn't think the resulting climate change will be catastrophic anytime soon.

n6xqkPhXaa	Let's hope at least he's more scientifically accurate than Hansen was.

68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	All you need to do is look at the 2000 year temperature graph excluding the tree ring proxies (which should be excluded and are only included by cherry picking bozos (no offense to the clown)). <br>  <a href="http://www.drroyspencer.com/global-warming-background-articles/2000-years-of-global-temperatures/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drroyspencer.com/global-warmi...</a><br>  This is a typical stretch of climate.  It moves in cycles from warm to cold and back to warm.  There are different cycles too, both longer and shorter.  As you can see by the graph, the warming didn't begin at the beginning of the 20th century following the LIA as Dana suggested. Historical records and climate proxies agree that warming began earlier than that and has generally continued to present.  We will have to wait and see if the recent downtrend is just a momentary lapse.  Only a fool or someone who can't read graphs would blame that warming on man (and I am not talking about a small percentage of the warming) but there are plenty out there.<br>  <br>  Note to Dawai.  We currently live in the Modern Maximum.  That maximum is the opposite of minimum (Maunder Minimum) (refers to the number of sunspots).  Hopefully we remain in the maximum and this recent shortage of sunspots ends.  Here is all the evidence you need.<a href="http://right-mind.us/blogs/blog_0/archive/2008/02/26/58366.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://right-mind.us/blogs/blog_0/archiv...</a><br>  It didn't begin cooling at 1900.  There was some cooling in the 1970s or so so I am not sure what Dawai is talking about there.|`|aWTo9K22aa	It's pointless to cherry pick things that we are relatively certain of their cause. The LIA corresponded to the Maunder Minimum, a 70 year period when sunspot activity was 1000-fold less than what it normally is. That caused temperatures to slightly cool; naturally, when the sun clicked back on, we got slightly warmer. <br>  <br>  Unless you can give an inkling of evidence that a similar solar minimum happened from 1900-1970, I don't really see how it relates.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	1) The planet doesn't magically go from cold to hot.  Just because the LIA ended a couple hundred years ago doesn't mean the planet would have magically warmed up without human influence.  The reason the planet began to warm was primarily due to an increase in solar output in the beginning of the 20th century, as a matter of fact.<br>  <br>  Basically your argument that the planet was "due" to warm up after the LIA is unscientific.  Thus there is no reason not to begin looking at the data 100-140 years ago.<br>  <br>  2) We started to collect average global temperature data in about 1880.  Thus that's a logical place to begin.<br>  <br>  3) The anthropogenic influence on climate began at roughly the same time, so again, it's a logical place to begin.<br>  <br>  I don't care if you start in 1880, 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960, or 1980.  But when you start to zoom way the hell in to just a 10 year period (or less), you're seeing noise rather than signal.  And then you make this mistake:<br>  <a href="http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/global-warming-is-over-once-every-decade-or-so/" rel="nofollow">http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2008/12/0...</a>|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	Because cherry picking is the act of selectively choosing data points to fit a preconceived conclusion, not the act of picking a starting point at all. If you want to examine the trend since 1900, it is perfectly logical to choose that date as your starting point. The same if you want to examine the trend since 1998. It becomes cherry picking when you want to examine the trend since 1998 for the sole reason that you believe (wrongly, in this case) that it fits your preconceived conclusion that global warming has stopped.<br>  <br>  Edit: 1900 may or may not be more logical than any other year. But if we want to examine trends in global temperatures since that date, it is perfectly logical to use it as our starting point. That, as you will no doubt see upon rereading my answer, is what I said.|`|sSvPEf97aa	Anything that shows that so-called "Global Warming" is just a part of natural cycles and not caused by man has to be shown as a hoax, and the accusation of "cherry-picking" is a means to win the argument by intimidation.  This claim now puts you on the defensive to show that you are not selecting your data.<br>  <br>  They always have to be right even while they cannot show any proof to their statements.  No one knows if it will be warmer or colder in the future.  The best they can do is state that 90% of all scientist say there's an 85% chance man is causing "global warming".<br>  <br>  There purpose is to raise taxes and to place limits on freedoms.  They can't do this if "Global Warming" was just a natural cycle.|`|sZ0McynSaa	Liberals when confronted and questioned will use the race card and other key PC finger pointing language because they know they do not have and answer or cannot argue a FACT. So all-in-all you will never get an answer from a Liberal.<br>  <br>  I agree with you.......Global warming is a freedom-taking SCAM.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Any one year selected to "prove" your point is cherry picking.
