yJSPecgoaa	A good thing to mention in your speech is that according to national surveys, the fear of public speaking is the  1 fear in America, surpassing the fear of illness, the fear of flying, the fear of terrorism, and amazingly, the fear of death itself!    A line by Jerry Seinfeld, in fact, goes," According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death....This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.      Some other pertinent quotes:    Public speaking is the art of diluting a two-minute idea with a two-hour vocabulary. ~ John F. Kennedy    There are certain things in which mediocrity is not to be endured, such as poetry, music, painting, public speaking ~Jean de la Bruyere    What this country needs is less public speaking and more private thinking ~Roscoe Drummond    EDITED TO ADD:    You might also want to look for a book (or read excerpts online) by Mary Fensholt, entitled, The Francis Effect: The Real Reason You Hate Public Speaking and How To Get Over It [Oakmont Press, 2006]   According to the author, the reason people fear public speaking is primal. Fensholt bases her theory on the work of sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson,who speculated that in the early days of man, being singled out and stared at was a prelude to being eaten by a predator.  Based on this "scientific" theory, you could argue (tongue-in-cheek, of course) that public speaking "goes against man's true nature."    Have fun and good luck with your speech.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	A bad public speaker might prejudice the argument.    The medium of public speaking may be unsuitable for conveying the information effectively. (if its highly  visual for example)    People absorb information at different rates - many may have difficulty understanding the message. (You could mitigate this with handouts).    They may misunderstand you if the topic is at all complicated (mitigate by uestion and answer)

9Ijv5Mppaa	DON'T apply to "famous" scholarships if you want to get any of them. People who wrangle money for college don't do it through scholarships that everyone applies for. Look into local organizations, especially if you or someone in your family is a member. Also, see if your school gives out scholarships and the process. Look on the internet for scholarships that you are uniquely qualified for. For example, I'm applying for a New York Women in Communications scholarships not because they offer a lot of money or it's famous, but because I'm female, going to college in NYC, and majoring in a communication field, so I am uniquely qualified.|`|fa78206ad92e8a3704fb4dec6ea7a230aa	i hav no idea....!!!|`|aIzKbpQGaa	sanskrit and ved path scholarships in my school

xJoMSkI5aa	If you are going to put blame on a person, you have to do the families of Romeo and Juliet. Their hatred for each other set a path for which there was no return and they were most directly involved.    A more Shakespearean answer would be fate. Shakespeare looks at fate and free will. Once Romeo and Juliet fell in love, their fate was set and there death was simply a matter of time.    From Shmoop/Romeo and Juliet

cL0aHkYEaa	The professor graded the midterm exams with unyielding stringency.  When half the class failed the test, his harangue about need for study and organization of class notes went on for half an hour.  Although no one said anything, the sense of outrage from the class was fairly palpable, because they felt the professor's exam had not addressed the chapters assigned.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	stringency is like strictness ... it's a quality, a characteristic, of a person or of a system of rules or regulations, or of how those rules are applied    to harangue is to go on at someone, giving them a hard time over something, preaching at them, maybe loud voiced, not listening to their feedback at all, not reasoning with them, just urgently, repeatedly, going on and on and on ....    palpable means touchable, feelable, squeezable, and is often used of things that particularly are NOT physically touchable in order to give a sense of how 'real' they are, like 'there was a palpable sense of fear in the room'|`|EZfb5R0Iaa	The stringency of their argument made me harangue them, just to quieten them, but I only added to the palpable tension in the room.

8qyofB7Zaa	I don't know about Ulster but Centennial College does NOT offer an MBA. They have a business program including graduate programs but they seem to offer an "Ontario College Advanced Diploma", not an MBA:    http://www.centennialcollege.ca/business    Centennial (and other "colleges" in Canada) are not equivalent to "universities" - they offer 2 or 3 year "diplomas", not 4-year Bachelor's degrees (with a few exceptions). As far as I know all MBA degrees in Canada are offered at "universities".     If you did want to go to a "college" in Toronto, I heard that Humber and Seneca have a better reputation than Centennial.

AA10526829	Hmmm--Here's how I'd go about answering the question. First, find out about the geography of this area.  A good physical map of the earth is in the National Geographic Atlas of the World, and is probably in a bunch of other books and/or on-line.  Or go to "Google Maps" and click on "physical" then drag the map around to Asia and zoom in as much as you need to so that you can distinguish where the mountains, seashores, etc. are.  I take "Southern and Eastern Asia" to mean the area between Pakistan on the west and China on the East (maybe Japan too).    Then find a map showing population densities by geographic area.  There may be something on the internet (I found the "Population Atlas of China" but couldn't get access for free--it's on "JStor"--your school may let you have free access).  Then superimpose the two.      You should be able to get an idea of where most of the people live and think of why they live there.  Keep in mind that most people outside of the developed world live where they can grow food or keep animals for food and fabric.  For example, if there are few people in the deserts of northern China and Mongolia, it's because there is not enough rain to support agriculture and therefore those who live there are primarily herders of sheep or some other kind of animal.

4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Completely and utterly depends on what you are interested in going into. There is no "best" university in Florida. But if you are interested in a degree in computers, you want to go the school with the best computer program. If you want to do electrical engineering, you want the school with the best engineering program. Which school is the best varies from field to field. So figure out your field, then research the schools based on that interest.     All that said, if you want to find the best school for whatever you are interested in, I suggest you drop the biased and subjective view of the university system you demonstrate here and focus on your career. That's the key. What town you live in or what "trouble" you are in is irrelevant.|`|P59bsF5Haa	I fell in love with UCF when I visited their website and when they sent me the catalog and brochure. This is just my personal opinion, however.     I agree with "Mr. Taco" it all depends on your goals and what you are interested in. Also, whatever your "trouble" is in Tampa, be sure there isn't the same problem wherever you go or that it can't follow you. Otherwise, you may be leaving a good thing for no reason. Just think before you make your decision. Good luck && hope this helped. If it didn't, oh well, its just yahoo. But seriously, I hope you do well.

(:|`|6DFhlt4daa	Always look on the bright side of life     it means as much as: take it easy    : : I think the expression could be derivated from: always look back at the bright side of your life, thus meaning: in times of trouble, don't remember the mishappenings and bad events you've had in your life, but remember the funny, nice and happy times you have had. remember this good things. stay happy.     http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board...    Hope is a belief in a positive outcome related to  events and circumstances in one's life. Hope  implies a certain amount of perseverance i.e.  believing that a positive outcome is possible even  when there is some evidence to the contrary.     A person who dreads of 'what tomorrow may bring'  looses the zeal of life itself. He can not live in  the present even for one day. I do not agree that  'any person can fight the battles of just one  day'. There are many in the world who fight their  battles life long, and still live with some hope.     It is nice to live for today and complete what is  to be done today. But humans are distinguished  from the rest of the living beings by hope. For  other living beings, there may not be tomorrow.  But hope is life for humans. Tomorrow may not come  for a few. But the others are sure that there will  be a day after present one. And it is hoped by  many to be a little better than today. What is not  realized today may be within our reach tomorrow.  It is hope that make people to live through all  torments of life. The moment a person loses hope,  the very zeal to live is lost.    Living in the past is dreaming. Living in the  present is intuition connected to basic instincts.  Living in hope of is humanistic rationality  to look for future.     Hope - Pandora brought the jar with the evils and  opened it. It was the gods` gift to man, on the  outside a beautiful, enticing gift, called the  "lucky jar." Then all the evils, those lively,  winged beings, flew out of it. Since that time,  they roam around and do harm to men by day and  night. One single evil had not yet slipped out of  the jar. As Zeus had wished, Pandora slammed the  top down and it remained inside. So now man has  the lucky jar in his house forever and thinks the  world of the treasure. It is at his service; he  reaches for it when he fancies it. For he does not  know that the jar which Pandora brought was the  jar of evils, and he takes the remaining evil for  the greatest worldly good - it is hope! For Zeus  did not want man to throw his life away, no matter  how much the other evils might torment him, but  rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew.  To that end, he gives man hope.     A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity;  an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.  - Winston Churchill     "Three grand essentials to happiness in this life  are something to do, something to love, and  something to hope for." - Joseph Addison    Hope!  Hope! Hope!  Delicious Hope! when naught to man is left -   Of fortune destitute, of friends bereft;  When even his dog deserts him, and his goat  With tranquil disaffection chews his coat  While yet it hangs upon his back; then thou,  The star far-flaming on thine angel brow,  Descendest, radiant, from the far skies   To touch the deepest depths of the heart    People sow seeds with hope  And hope is the seed of life  People through ages hoped for eternity  Because hope is as great as eternity  Never give-up hope, never ever  Hope is your best mate, all the time  Even if all desert you unexpectedly  Hope will be with you, if you wish....|`|6hvw6lkNaa	I think it means when something happens that isn't good to look at the good that could come out of it. (if you go about it in the right way)

ufdFei1jaa	Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams  agreed a date for the return of power sharing in Northern Ireland during historic talks at Stormont.<br>  Following their first ever face-to-face discussions, the leaders of the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Féin announced a target date of May 8 for the restoration of devolved government.<br>  <br>  The government had set a deadline for a restoration of power sharing before direct rule from London was restored permanently and will now have to rush emergency legislation through the House of Commons to prevent this.<br>  <br>  "After a long and difficult time in our province, I believe that enormous opportunities lie ahead for our province," Mr Paisley told reporters, as he sat at a conference table next to Mr Adams.<br>  <br>  The agreement "marks the beginning of a new era of politics on this island", the Sinn Féin leader agreed, but added that he found it "disappointing" that Northern Ireland's political institution could not be restored immediately.<br>  <br>  The British prime minister, Tony Blair, hailed the agreement, saying: "This is a very important day for the people of Northern Ireland but also for the people and the history of these islands."<br>  <br>  "In a sense, everything we have done over the last ten years has been a preparation for this moment, because the people of Northern Ireland have spoken through the election," he told reporters, after talking by phone with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern.<br>  <br>  "They have said we want peace and power-sharing and the political leadership has then come in behind that and said we will deliver what people want."<br>  <br>  In Ireland, Mr Ahern called today's developments "unprecedented and very positive", and said both governments would cooperate with the new May 8 date for devolution.<br>  <br>  The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, said a one clause emergency bill would be put through parliament with the agreement of opposition parties, and would need royal assent before midnight tomorrow to prevent the dissolution of the Stormont assembly.<br>  <br>  Mr Hain described today's events as "really, really momentous".<br>  <br>  <br>  The crucial meeting saw delegations from the DUP and Sinn Féin spend an hour together inside a room at Stormont to hammer out the final agreement for a return to power sharing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Afterwards, both leaders talked about the work still needing to be done, including regular meetings between Mr Paisley and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness as the de facto first and deputy first ministers.<br>  <br>  Clearly conscious of the historical significance of their talks, Mr Paisley and Mr Adams spoke of the suffering caused by the decades of inter-community violence and their responsibility to ensure permanent peace and reconciliation.<br>  <br>  Northern Ireland's politicians must "never forget those who have suffered during the dark period from which we are, please God, emerging", Mr Paisley said.<br>  <br>  He added: "I want to make it clear that I am committed to delivering not only for those who voted for the DUP but for all the people of Northern Ireland.<br>  <br>  "We must not allow our justified loathing for the horrors and tragedies of the past to become a barrier to creating a better and more stable future for our children."<br>  <br>  Mr Adams said there was now new hope for the future, following the previous "sad history of orange and green".<br>  <br>  "There are still many challenges, many difficulties, to be faced. But let us be clear: the basis of the agreement between Sinn Féin and the DUP follows Ian Paisley's unequivocal and welcome commitment to support and participate fully in the political institutions on May 8," he said.<br>  <br>  "We've all come a very long way in the process of peace making and national reconciliation. We are very conscious of the many people who have suffered. We owe it to them to build the best future possible." <br>  <br>  The proposal for the historic meeting came after a frantic weekend of consultation in Belfast and Berlin, where Mr Blair and Mr Ahern were attending a ceremony to mark 50 years of the European Union.<br>  <br>  Both prime ministers had repeatedly insisted the assembly would be dissolved if no agreement on an executive had been reached by today's legal deadline. No 10 was forced into a last-minute change of strategy after Mr Paisley's DUP, agreed in principle on Saturday to share power with Sinn Féin, but demanded an extension of the deadline for the formation of the executive until May.<br>  <br>  The DUP, which is badly split, said they needed the further time to see if Sinn Féin would comply with its commitment to cooperate with the Northern Ireland police service.<br>  <br>  Until now Mr Paisley's DUP had always refused to meet Sinn Féin; each represents what used to be seen as the two extremes of Northern Ireland sectarian politics.

Basically the rating. <br>  <br>  What is the theme directly related to? Does the film contain aspects that would be more readily identifiable by adults, children or teenagers?<br>  <br>  I.e a film aimed at teenagers would in some way include sex, drugs, music, friendship issues, family issues, social implications etc<br>  <br>  What about the genre of the film itself? <br>  The characters and their personalities - who would be able to identify to them more children, teenagers, or adults?<br>  <br>  If you google different phrases such as "how films target their audience" or "targeting audience techniques" I'm sure you'll come up<br>  with heaps of stuff.

AA11599990	hi i found a post related to career option in software , hope this is helpful to you <br>  .Software programmer: This is one option that all most all of them are aware of; the job profile involves  writing computer programs in some programming language like c#, vb.net, ASP.net, PHP. The various platforms available are the desktop, the web or the mobile. Based on the platform you choice the choice of programming language. You could also decide which platform you want to target and based on that get extra certification or projects to enhance your employment chances.<br>  <br>  2. Software Testing:   Software Testing is the other vital aspect of creating and delivering  software.  A software programmer would develop software and the task of a software Test engineer is to ensure that the software satisfies the quality criteria laid by the organization.<br>  In software testing, you would look at looking for application crashes, application behavior subject to various inputs and observe the outputs of the program. Software testing can be majorly divided into Blackbox testing and White box testing. <br>  <br>  3.Database Administrator(DBA):  Various large application requires , to store and retrieve data. These data are stored in Databases (DBMS). There is a vast need to manage these databases. The major role here is to create users, backup data, optimize the database for performance, etc. The major option of specialization is Oracle, SQL server, DB2 etc.  Various certifications are possible and provided by the vendors of these products.<br>  <br>  4. Software sales:  Many students are not aware about the opportunities available in the software sales department. The software created has to be marketed and sold. Selling of software requires the correct understanding of the domain, the product . Understanding user requirements and approaching right customers. This requires understanding of the software systems. Hence Engineers have good potential in this field too.|`|N2wBdq44aa	hi,u can go for professional courses<br>  such as ccna(cisco certified network associate),mcse(microsoft certified systems engineer)<br>  all the best for your future

VaputSaZaa	first this is all you need to know about secondary research:<br>  <br>   <br>  Secondary research involves the summary, collation and synthesis of existing research rather than primary research, where data is collected from research subjects or experiments. Secondary research is mostly used in the like of market research. <br>     <br>         Secondary research is were you use other information that other people    have gathered through primary research. Some people think of it as      ‘second hand’ information.                                                                                         <br>  <br>               Primary research is also know as field research and secondary research has another name, desk research, as it traditionally involved sitting at a desk reading through a lot of material. An example could be visiting a library and reading through books, reports and newspapers and extracting the information that was relevant. Now we have PCs and the internet there is an enormous amount of secondary data available to us.<br>  <br>  <br>  It would however be very difficult to conduct your own survey to find out about the economy, you would therefore have to rely on information compiled by other people that is where secondary data come in.<br>  <br>  <br>  print products i think is just you printing a product off the internet and finding some secondary research to go with it<br>   not sure on audio visual products <br>  but internet i think is where you need to get anythink to do with what your secondary research is on off the internet and write a bit about it this is only what i think you should do but i hope it helps

2UvVIRjNaa	I think the most common age-related vision problem is farsightedness (hyperopia) - you can see objects in the distance clearly, but objects nearby may be blurry.  Your vision is fine one day and the next thing you know, you're holding a menu right up to your face to read it and when that doesn't work, you try extending it as far away as possible.  <br>  <br>  From what I've seen, I'd say age 43 - 45 is a closer age estimate when hyperopia begins. This gradual impairment is so common that "reading glasses" are inexpensive and easily available at most stores. The lens power starts out at +1.00 and increase in .25 increments. I use the +1.25 glasses.?|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Yea, I'm over 40.  Not by much, tho.  I have to wear reading glasses now.  I can still see far away like I always could, but my arms are long enough to read up close anymore.<br>  <br>  I keep 2+ cheap reading glasses in every room of my house so I don't have to wear them unless I have to.  My vision started going about 8 years ago.  I was crabby about it, too.  I didn't bother seeing an eye doctor, tho.<br>  <br>  The body changes as we age.  I can't eat the foods I used to, I can't drink liquor like I used to, I can't sleep in either.  Don't be so hard on yourself because you're changing.  Sh*t happens.  Dealing with CHANGE is essential.  You should know that by now.

However, I'd be giving a basic view of what the stuff that feeds into disco is/was: Soul music, TSOP music, 'pop' music' all came together.  The fact that the world in the late 1970s was on an upturn economically meant that people could afford to buy new clothes, jewellry etc and needed to go out and show off, and the disco was a place where the shinier/ 'blingier' the better.  Classic artists: O'Jays: Trammps:  Earth Wind and Fire: Gap Band: KC and the Sunshine Band:  The disco 'scene' became more commercialised with the release of Saturday Night Fever movie and bands like Bee Gees, Abba etc became part of what had, to that point, been more of a black music movement.<br>  I'm sorry but 'any information you have on minuets' does sound rather like the sort of thing that has people answering that you should do your own work... way too vague....|`|c3DqvgE4aa	go to a disco site<br>  u cant see me there coz of the flashes

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	You probably couldn't get what would otherwise be costly research done for free, but if you wanted a relatively simple study done which it would be possible for students to complete, if your business is something likely to interest students, and if you were flexible in your time frame, you would approach the department head in the appropriate department to see if there are classes willing to take your business on as a project.  As a Dean, and formerly as a department chair, I get such calls all the time.  The problem is that people often call me at an awkward time - for example, classes will just have started and all faculty already have all the projects they need.  My faculty will rarely agree to do a project for free unless it is either a nonprofit business or a low-income individual who could never afford to pay for research otherwise, and more and more schools are developing fee scales for such work.  It is still usually cheaper than hiring a consultant, but not free in these cases.

There are a lot of requirements we have to meet.<br>  <br>  Like doing a child protection course and first aid. Also having a background check done to us -- they are the musts.<br>  <br>  It is obvious that to be a teacher you need a higher qualification, i.e. University degree. <br>  <br>  What else.... hmm. Well, in relation to the minimum of mathematics and science requirements - if you live in Australia (NSW) we have the Syllabus by the Department of Education. We run off that, as it is a legal document that states what we ought to do and how much of it. We are told that by law we have to spend 'x' amount of time teaching the 'x' subject.<br>  <br>  Mathematics and English are of high priority. Other areas of study are not stressed as much - but are important, and do have specific guidelines on how much content has to be covered.<br>  <br>  Keeping in mind - with teaching, you can always inter-relate subjects and cover material in one go.|`|AE3lv4pRaa	Basically,she should be a graduate to teach in the primary sections.<br>  she should be good in her subjects ,her english fluency should be good so that the students should be able to understand what the teacher explains to them.|`|va8quhPtaa	A graduation with lot of patience.|`|FZ19TZpxaa	Online Tutoring-<br>  <a href="http://degretutor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://degretutor.com/</a>

GF1NPlBSaa	I can only address the Clemson portion of this question...I'm not sure which TOEFL you took but it appears there are different scores depending on the test format.  From the Clemson website: "A TOEFL score of 550 on the paper version, 213 on the computer version or 79-80 on the Internet-based version is generally required. The TOEFL may be waived for transfer students who have earned a grade of C or better in English Composition I & II from an accredited U.S. college or university. The test may also be waived for students from countries where English is the primary language or one of the official languages."<br>  <br>  Clemson's average freshman SAT score as of 2007 was 1225 (I believe last year it went up into the 1230's) but that's on a scale of 1600, not 2400.  Although Clemson very strongly recommends (and may even require by now, I'm not 100% sure) that prospective students take the new 3rd portion of the SAT, they currently aren't including that score in their SAT averages.  If your score was 1510 over all 3 sections, I think you are probably going to have trouble gaining acceptance.  <br>  <br>  One thing about Clemson's admissions process is that they do not consider extracurricular activities at all, so whether you're good or bad them will not affect your chances there.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

sZg4QZs0aa	I have to present an alternative view to these negative comments about online universities.  I think there is little difference between an on-line universitiy and a traditional brick and mortar university.  I would say that I am uniquely qualified to answer that because:<br>  <br>  I have a Bachelor of Science and 2 Master's Degrees from traditional brick and mortar schools, and;<br>  <br>  I have a MS in Computer Information Systems and have just sucessfully completed my PhD comprehensive exams from two well known on-line Schools.<br>  <br>  Without telling you specifically what degrees I got, the schools I went to were:<br>  <br>  The University of Maryland<br>  Mississippi State University<br>  The Air Force Institute of Technology<br>  University of Phoenix<br>  Capella University<br>  <br>  Three of these schools are traditional (U of M, MSU, AFIT) and two were on-line.  The worst was the University of Maryland (Brick and Mortar), the Best was Capella (On-line) and the rest fall in between.  All are accreditied by one of the regional bodies of the Higher Commision on Learning - which are the important accrediting bodies.<br>  <br>  So to simply say that on-line schools are not worth the paper they are written on is just making an irrational statement that may be based in long held bias on on-line education.  However, today there are over 176 acredited schools that are on-line, including such notable brick and mortar schools such as Clemson, DePaul, Gonzaga, Oregon State University, University of Florida, University of Maryland, Notre Dame, University of Illinois, and others.<br>  <br>  Perhaps even as little as six years ago, it might have been safe to say that on-line education was not reputable.  However, that has not been true for the past few years. The schools that have been in this from the beginning are getting better, and what many of the traditional schools have figured out is that there is an adult education population in the US who can't afford to drop out of the workforce to go college, but has the disipline and desire to both work and go to school.<br>  <br>  There is some bias in some traditional, purely academic circles, against on-line universities, but I think it is fading fast.  <br>  <br>  BTW, I am a hiring manager, and I would hire someone with all As from a accredited on-line university before I would hire someone with Bs and Cs from a traditional state-run university.  Many of the traditional state run universities have MUCH lower standards than in the past.  Beside, why do I want to hire someone who has been taught by graduate assistants for two or three years?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	Online degrees aren't worth the printer paper they are printed on.  When I was doing hiring and firing, I would NEVER hire someone with just an online degree.. of course.. I wouldn't hire a SMOKER.. either.|`|S8aCj7m7aa	On-line degrees from traditional University...such as the University of Maryland, University of Nebraska, University of Alabama, etc...are acceptable...your degree will look identical to the degree you would receive if you were on campus, however a on-line degree from a "University" with no actual physical facility will not be acceptable by most employers.|`|WSqdxV81aa	It really depends on whre you get it from.  If you get it from one of these schools that advertise as being an online school it may be frowned upon some.  look into online degrees from traditional schools.  these programs are virtual mirror images of the campus program and when you receive your degree there is no distinction made to differentiate it from the on campus degree.  us news has a link of traditional schools that offer online learning.  look into this.  www.usnews.com/sections/education/e-lear...  look into schools in your area first.  search their websites, online learning on a traditional school's site is not always easy to find.  and there is this thinking that the schools that advertise as being online are cheaper, and in most cases they are actually the same price or a little more expensive because most are "for profit"|`|a93e72e806f4b80afaedd35f330600edaa	I don't know how many people with degrees from DeVry, University of Phoenix etc can actually get jobs when there is so much stigma attached to it. My dad doesn't hire people with online degrees because he doesn't understand how someone could gain the same experience and application through simply doing everything online. I wouldn't hire someone with an online degree from any school like that, either. It just seems like... if you REALLY wanted to go to school, you would have found a way to go to a community college or something since they really try to cater to the busy students with jobs and do so very well.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't think it has the same value. I think many people are prejudiced against online degrees (most of the time I don't blame them) from these diploma mill schools. Also many, if not all, of the credits from these institutions do NOT transfer if you wish to get a bachelors degree or go to a real school. You will essentially start all over again and lose all of that money.<br>  <br>  If you really want to do an online school, make it from a university that counts at least... like Drexel. They have an extensive online program.|`|Q7haeWgvaa	No, because there are many practical and actual applications that you have learned during theoretical studies that can not be accomplish on on-line studies.

Is it the same percent by which Rs. 2,400 is more than Rs. 2,000?<br>  <br>  No it is not!<br>  <br>  To calculate a percentage, divide the amount that is not 100% by the amount that is 100% and multiply by 100<br>  <br>  Let Rs 2400 = 100%<br>  <br>  2000 / 2400 * 100 = 83.33%<br>  <br>  Now let Rs 2,000 = 100% <br>  <br>  2400 / 2000 * 100 = 120%<br>  <br>  It is a bigger percentage because 2000 is a smaller amount than 2400, so 400 is 1/5th of 2000 but only 1/6th of 2,400<br>  <br>  Example, use simpler figures choose 80 and 100.<br>  we know that 80 is 80% of 100<br>  <br>  Let 100 be 100%<br>  <br>  To calculate it, in case we forgot<br>  80/100 * 100 = 80%<br>  <br>  Now let 80 = 100%<br>  100/80*100 = 125%<br>  <br>  The percentages are different because the difference, 20,  is 1/4 of 80 but 1/5 of 100 Using simpler figures can make it easier to see<br>  <br>  Rs is not important, you don't need to know what it is to work out the precentages.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	While I do think it is useful for administrators to occasionally teach a course in order to remind themselves of what it is like in the classroom (I had a boss for many years who had not been in the classroom for over 25 years, and he tended to be overly critical of faculty for things like a single criticism on a course evaluation), I would say that it is generally not feasible to do this very often.  Not only is administration itself more than a full-time job, but the school head often has to be available on a moment's notice to handle an emergency, which is difficult to do if you are responsible for a class.|`|VJ2aG6znaa	If it is a smallish school, yes.  50% or abouts.

AA10887916	I should go to one of the main airline websites and access the customer complaints section- that may give some idea of how they would deal with difficult situations.  <br>  Some other possibilities are delayed flights (drinks/meal vouchers)<br>  Overbooked flights (seat upgrades or 'bumping' - getting passengers to take a deal to fly another day with inducements).  Passengers being incorrectly routed (usually ticketing office problem confusing three letter codes) - there is debate over what responsibility the customer has to check this up.  Other issues are dealing with situations which are basically the passenger's fault (arriving late, forgetting passport, carrying too much luggage) and how airlines should deal with these - it is difficult as many passengers seem to blame everyone but themselves.

I've had college students in class who were functionally illiterate and couldn't read standard multiple choice tests), and my mother tutored illiterate adults for years.  Some were immigrants who never learned to read in their own countries, some dropped out of school very early for various reasons, and some came from bad schools where no one cared if they never learned to read and just passed them from one grade to another anyway.<br>  <br>  Looking around you may not be the best measure of this.  If you are educated, chances are pretty good that so are your family and friends.  There are parts of the country in which this is a much greater problem than in others, and if you don't happen to live in one of those areas, you probably can't imagine that there are such places.|`|G50ucmllaa	I saw something similar and it said they could not read at a 5th grade level, which I find easily believable.

AA10887916	For the current situation, your story will need to be set 'someplace' where child labour laws are not rigorously enforced (if they exist at all).  An asian block sweatshop is not a bad idea.  The other possibility could be the use of child labour in Central/ South America to do hazardous work such as cutting sugar cane.  A good (and topical) spin on this could be to use the parallel of the plight of the child with the bosses of the big companies who benefit from child labour (Nike for the sweatshops, Coca-Cola for the sugar cutting).

For the first exam (using the set of numbers 21, 23, 24,and 18) I would say a 21 or a 22. For the second exam (using the second set of numbers 20, 28, 19, 19) the score would be either a 21 or 22. If they use the highest scores (like the schools will use your highest SAT scores in all areas instead of a test by test basis) it would be a 23.<br>  <br>  I could be wrong, as I'm not an expert on ACT scoring they may use a different system than simple averages.

Anabolic Steroids are  types of natural and synthetic hormones that stimulate cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training. (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).<br>  <br>  Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but at a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain can occur. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).<br>  <br>  There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).<br>  <br>  Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large numbert of teenagers have access to the drugs for their use.<br>  <br>  As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).<br>  Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops", "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).<br>  5 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.

So if this was what the parent intended, then I would instruct the child to keep the phone in his or her backpack. In our buildings we have lock down so that no one that we do not know is allowed in. i would wager that the student is safe while in the building. So, the only time they would need the cell phone would be once they left the building. I shouldn't have to see the cell phone and the child should not be taking it out and showing it around because it should be in the backpack. If the parent were so paranoid that they think that the child might be abducted from the school building, I would suggest homeschooling. On the same note, my high school student keeps his cell phone in hos backpack and is not allowed to take it to class. if the child cannot follow this rule, they are not allowed to have them.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Children are not supposed to have cellphones on campus at my school, but generally if the students leave the phone off and do not take them out, nothing is done about that.

Students could text each other answers to tests and quizzes. One way it would be beneficial to use cell phones during school hours is students being able to instantly communicate to people in other classes using texting.

a93e72e806f4b80afaedd35f330600edaa	The following are the general eligibility requirements in order to take the GED:<br>  <br>  1. Residency: Each state, province, territory, or other jurisdiction administers the GED Tests to any qualified adult who meets that jurisdiction's criteria for residency.<br>  <br>  2. Educational limitations: Only a person who neither holds a traditional high-school diploma nor has already earned a GED is eligible to take the GED Tests. A person who has been awarded a high-school equivalency diploma or earned scores sufficient to qualify for a high-school equivalency diploma is eligible to re-test under certain conditions.<br>  <br>  3. Enrollment limitation:<br>  The GED Tests are not administered to a candidate who is enrolled in an accredited high school, including any of those accredited by regional accrediting bodies and those approved by the jurisdiction's department/ministry of education.<br>  <br>  4. Age limitation: To take the GED tests you must be at least 16 years of age. There may be additional requirements for minors depending upon the particular state or province. Many states requires takers to be 18+ years of age.<br>  <br>  If you meet all of these requirements, I don't see why not. Depending on the state in which you will take the test, you need to researched the residency requirements.

iGxZvP3aaa	Creationism should be taught in any Comparative Religion class as one of the many explanations various religions have given for the existence of, well, all of this.  <br>  <br>  You mentioned evolution. Evolution should absolutely not be taught in a Religion class.  Evolution has nothing to do with religion.  Evolution is part of science, which deals with what and attempts to understand how. Religion deals with why.  They address entirely different questions.

d5e940b0dd9079a5509ef972ba60a9bdaa	While I cannot speak for California, I can inform you about the process in North Carolina and give you some generalities that should help you in your decision.<br>  <br>  NC is unique because there is a state law that mandates that all NC state-supported colleges must accept the credits of all the other NC state-supported colleges.<br>  <br>  Now, how are universities across the US all similar?  Simply put, if you go to a community college for 2 years and finish up your general education, you should easily be able to get into any state-funded university.  Universities tend to lose a lot of people after their freshmen years as people drop out.  Sophmores also tend to drop out, though not as much.  This means that when you have completed your two years at a community college, schools such as USC and UCLA will be looking to bring in more people to improve their graduation rate.  This makes it much, much easier to get into USC or UCLA versus trying to get in as a freshman straight out of high school.  <br>  <br>  This does not mean that it's easy, per se.  You will still want to get good grades (at least a 3.0 gpa though the higher the better).  Having an extracurricular activity or two doesn't hurt, either.  <br>  <br>  However, transferring schools is tricky.  As I said above, I'm not sure about California, but NC has that law in effect which prevents students from getting screwed out of their credit hours.  California may not.  This means that just because you complete 60 credit hours at a community college does not mean that USC or UCLA will accept all 60 credit hours.  They may say, "Yes, we see that you completed those courses, but they are nothing like what we teach here.  So, we'll count 9 of those credit hours as credits here."  And just like that you are a freshman again.  But hey - at least you got in.<br>  <br>  In summation, get your high school diploma and go to a community college.  Get in contact with UCLA and USC's admissions department early and keep in contact with them often.  They can advise you on what you should and should not be doing.  Go to a community college and demonstrate excellent academic progress and you should be at UCLA or USC (hopefully as a junior!) in just a few short years.  Good luck!|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	If I were you I'd go somewhere cheaper.  Go to Community College for a couple years, and if you feel ready THEN apply to USC or UCLA.<br>  <br>  And be sure to make good grades at CC, they'll be proof about how far you've come.

a66nvk0taa	Greece, Spain, Hungary and Portugal have lifted restrictions on access to their labour markets for Bulgarian and Romanian workers, the European Commission announced on 8 January 2009.<br>  <br>  The four countries join ten other EU Member States which had already opened their labour markets for workers from Bulgaria and Romania. Restrictions remain in eleven Member States.<br>  <br>  The first phase of the transitional arrangements on free movement for Bulgarian and Romanian workers ended on 31 December 2008. Until then, Bulgarian and Romanian workers were free to work in 10 Member States while 15 Member States imposed restrictions on free movement (usually requiring a work permit). EU-25 countries that wanted to continue to apply restrictions during the second phase of the transitional arrangements had to notify the Commission before 1 January 2009.<br>  <br>  Eleven EU-25 Member States have notified the Commission of their decision to continue to apply national law on labour market access after 1 January 2009. Four Member States (Greece, Spain, Hungary, and Portugal) that previously restricted access of Bulgarian and Romanian workers to their labour markets have decided to lift these and now apply European law on free movement of workers. This means that workers from Bulgaria and Romania can now move freely to 14 Member States to take up employment there. Denmark, which currently imposes some restrictions, has also announced that it will stop applying restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers from 1 May 2009, when it will also end all restrictions for workers from the EU-8 Member States.<br>  <br>  All Member States that continue to restrict labour market access by applying national law can end these restrictions at any time during the second phase. In principle, full free movement of workers should apply after the end of the second phase (31 December 2011). Member States can only maintain restrictions thereafter if there is a serious disturbance (or threat thereof) to the labour market. All restrictions for workers from Bulgaria and Romania must be lifted by 31 December 2013 at the very latest when full free movement of workers will apply across the EU-27.<br>  <br>  So with your Bulgarian dual citsenship you won't be able to move around that freely only four of the EU countries have lifted restrictions on access to their labour markets for Bulgarian and Romanian workers. That mean you can't work in other 23 EU countries

Either way, you get advanced standing into the 2nd or 3rd year of university.<br>  <br>  It's definitely a good course, just for the range of careers when  you graduate.

inZ9CWBiaa	Is he being fired because the music department is being eliminated or because he has done something wrong?<br>  <br>  If it is the first - you are in trouble because the combination of tight budgets and an (over) emphasis on testing under NCLB means that a lot of schools are slashing budgets for the arts and for PE etc. If the department is being cut, the only way that he could keep his job is if he is certified to teach in another area. You will need to try to convince people that it is worth more of their tax money to keep the music dept.<br>  <br>  If it is the department - maybe a slogan like<br>  "Don't stop the music"<br>  "Don't silence our voices"<br>  "Keep x school arts smart"<br>  <br>  If he is being fired for cause, you really don't have much hope as it is actually really difficult to fire a teacher - you need to go through lots of steps and the union and give warnings etc.If it is for cause there will be a serious problem somewhere that you don't know about<br>  <br>  Don't know about a t-shirt for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck anyway. I think it is criminal to remove music from a school|`|nqbcJjHyaa	That's a letter of resignation, not recognition. And under no circumstance should he write one. Pass the info on to him that if he resigns he gives up all legal rights to unemployment compensation and any legal rights to get his job back. Odds are the school wants a new football or basketball coach and the school needs a position for him/her to teach. Under no circumstances, despite any pressure, he should not resign. Let him get fired if it comes down to it, at least he'll have a year of unemployment benefits, can buy health insurance through the school, and by contract would be hired back if the position is open.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Something is going on here that either you don't know about, or which you aren't telling us.  The clue is in your first sentence.  I'm not sure what a "letter of recognition" is, but it sounds like they think he did something wrong, and unless he can clear himself or apologize for it, they are letting him go.  <br>  <br>  If this were a budget firing, they would not have given him this choice (and they wouldn't hire someone next year - they would just reduce the number of teachers and eliminate music at your school, as they are doing in many places right now).  So he may have improved the music department, but maybe he was rude to the Principal, or offended a parent, or did something to a student that you may not know about.  It can't be too terrible, or they would not be able to hire him back whether he wrote a letter or not, but apparently he has to recognize that he did something wrong before they will let him stay.<br>  <br>  Because that is the case, shirts won't help (and the abbreviation for "department" is usually dept, not depo).  This issue has nothing to do with you and your friends, and no matter how passionate you are about having him stay, the key is now in the teacher's hands, not yours.  If he doesn't write that letter, nothing you do will help.|`|2p0UEczoaa	There is not anything that you should do.  If he doesn't have tenure he can be asked to leave for any reason.  Often, teachers may be liked by the kids but they don't fit into the teaching/education community.  He may be annoying to other teachers and administrators.

AA11725619	hey i just messaged you, haha. i applied to HKUST too, tho  havent heard anything from them yet.  are you applying undergrad?  either way, hku and ust really like international applicants,from what i understand their heavily aiming to diversify their student bodies.  unis are competitive in HK, but they are very lenient to internationals, depending on your selected major.  like if you apply for traditional chinese medicine in hku, thats still really hard.  However, if you are post-grad, i dont know anything...are you applying for next year?  because HKU applications are closed but UST is still going a bit longer...
EvyY3dUNaa	The interference colors from a soap film can be related to the thickness of the film by using the interference condition and noting that there is a 180 degree phase change upon reflection from the film surface, but no phase change for the reflection from the back surface. The color seen depends also upon the angle of view. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/phyopt/soapfilm.html" rel="nofollow">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hba...</a><br>  <br>  Large soap bubbles can be produced from a solution of dishwashing detergent and glycerine. Experimenting with mixtures can produce solutions that will make long-lasting bubbles. In these examples it is not evident what order of interference is being seen, but the colors range through the entire visible spectrum. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  An ellipsometer enables to measure the refractive index and the thickness of semi-transparent thin films. The instrument relies on the fact that the reflection at a dielectric interface depends on the polarization of the light while the transmission of light through a transparent layer changes the phase of the incoming wave depending on the refractive index of the material. An ellipsometer can be used to measure layers as thin as 1 nm up to layers which are several microns thick. Applications include the accurate thickness measurement of thin films, the identification of materials and thin layers and the characterization of surfaces<br>  <br>  EVALUATION OF REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THIN FILM<br>  <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u18436603t625357/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/u184...</a>|`|qGh1HhPwaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_film" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_film</a>

LId3qnI1aa	That the students require additional support and help and cannot reach their potential in normal classes and education.<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|pDvlQQkcaa	Special education is a federally mandated program created (initially in 1975) which permits k-12 (and eligible people with disabilities up to 21) to receive appropriate services in public k-12 schools across America. <br>  <br>  The public k-12 schools are obligated to provide a free appropriate public education to all students with any level/severity of disabilities. This includes/affects both access to the physical building and the content of the curriculum itself.<br>  <br>  It requires a higher degree of accommodations than 'reasonable accommodation', the school must provide accommodations such as physical/occupational therapy and aides during the day so the student can attend the classes. A helping teacher can come into classrooms to keep students up with peers. <br>  <br>  However, mainstreaming does not have to occur only where a student's disability is so severe that their content must be modified beyond what an average person at their grade level would be expected to comprehend. In this case, the public school can place students in a 'special room' with trained personnel, but they must have adequate justification. <br>  <br>  And special education, does not apply in college--this is where 504 and ADA now apply. Colleges only admit any person with disabilities under reasonable accommodation. Because any college is not obligated to admit all prospective students, this is why does not then have to admit all students with a disability either. A college only admits any prospective student who is reasonably capable of successfully completing the institution's course work.|`|cp7regataa	well it is an opportunity for the school to request Title IX money to finance a "special need" child which may or may not be spent specifically on the child in question.  It is also gives the teacher(s) the opportunity to remove a "at risk" child from the traditional classroom setting an put them into a special needs classroom...thus elimination of an underperforming student into a catagory that is usually not counted in the overall test scores of the schools.  Whose numbers wouldn't look good if you could take out all of your lower scoring students?  The isolated children are given monotonus assignments like memorizing the days of the week, months of the year etc and are totally left out of math english science etc.  But wait....No Child Left Behind goes into effect and all these children must be mainstreamed back into the classroom with an "aid" if necessary... So the child is back into the classroom expected to know everything and having this aid as a sign "I am here because this kid is a tard" ostrasizing the child from their peers even more.  The teachers expect the mainstreamed child to keep up even though they cannot.... the teachers then complain they had all these "special needs" kids shoved down their throats against their will and they refuse to work with those students ....because "no child left behind" was an unfunded mandate meaning no money for your school to deal with this problem.  The child is expected to write essays even though they had no previous writing experience in elementary school.  The child is suppose to get extra help but instead they are left in the dust.  Can you tell I am not a fan?  I had to deal with this BS for 12 years....Oh I didn't even tell you about the testing evaluations, conferences that I had to take off work for questionaires phone calls all so the school could get more grant money for the "special needs" program.

My special ed teacher worked with me and she forced the other teachers that I had at the time to also work with me. The reason why I know she forced the issue was because I had one b*tch, that calls herself an english teacher, inform me that "People like you simply either need to grow up and start doing your own work or drop out so that we won't have to waste our time or money trying to teach people like you." That has been over 22 years now but what this b*tch said to me has been like a thorn in my side ever since and it pisses me off just thinking about it especially since the fact that I'm attending college, maintaining a 4.00 GPA, and doing so while working a full time job and trying to keep household running all at the same time.  <br>  <br>  This is the exact purpose of special education any cuts the government trys to implement on the special education program will be met with fierce resistance.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Einstein<br>  <br>        Well Mary D has just about said it all, or perhaps not,  although I'm sure she is right in a lot of cases.<br>        As I understand it there are two types of "Special Education". One type the type being referred to by Mary B.  Is where the child has "special needs" due to a health condition or disability.  The other type is where the child or student needs additional support in order to bring them to an average or acceptable level of education so as to progress "normally" through the school system.  The former or first type usually takes the form of life long learning.  Whilst the latter is usually only required temporarily while that child/student catches up.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	Special Ed. is for students that have some kind of disability that affects their academics.

11a734d02a61c7fd63fff863ecaae116aa	You dont really have anything to study for AP Comps, except the Literary terms.You can't really study much for the test since you dont know what passage you have to read or what issue you have to discuss. The multiple choice part is basically passages with questions after it, and my only problem with that part is that there's usually not enough time so I suggest you practice some multiple choice questions and speed reading through passages while getting their meaning at same time. One of the essays usually ask you whether you agree/disagree on an issue. My suggestion on that one is that you learn to take a stand on things. Don't be wishy-washy and stuck in the middle. Pick a side, even if you are not 100% into it, and defend your ground. <br>  <br>  <br>  APUSH is probably hardest one since it's very broad.

Also, if you are offered points of information during your speech, allow about 3, and don't hesitate to reject them. Make sure you keep looking forward during your own speech, never look at the person offering the point, and be polite in accepting or rejecting, with a simple "Yes please" or "No, thank you".<br>  <br>  4.Be humourous! You're talking about whether or not aliens exist! Make it funny and interesting, don't just state facts. Tell them why YOU believe Aliens don't exist! The audience appreciates humour.<br>  <br>  5. Know what you're going to say before you get up there, and know your speech very well.

But anyway, getting back to the important matter at hand - the question. <br>  <br>  Maybe she implied another meaning? What if what she was really asking me was "What do I really mean to you?". I am a little unsure, but I know her, and she only says what she really means. To tell you the truth, I love her very much. In fact, I would take the bullet. There is nothing more important to me in this life than my friends.<br>  <br>  But after thinking about death, there's another question: would she take a bullet for me? I never thought it would be such a tough question, but in reality, people wouldn't really take a bullet for another person; that is something usually reserved for the movies. <br>  <br>  We say that we would take a bullet for someone, but would we really do that in a life or death situation?|`|va8quhPtaa	You should remember that after sacrifice there is nothing in life.

Maybe  get some sponsors to help out or some other backing.|`|PrFn1Wi0aa	I can definitely understand the benefits of an improved gym.  A few things you might want to do to convince people that your idea is one to pursue, you might provide a few more details:<br>  <br>  You mentioned  reasons an improvement is needed and to some degree how the improvements would benefit the school as a whole.<br>  <br>  As a suggestion you might research how much each of those improvements would cost and present it in the order of importance.<br>  <br>  Also, look up the fundraisers that you mentioned and see what type of revenue it can actually bring in and what the requirements are for a school to participate.  You might find other fundraisers available while doing this.  <br>  <br>  Just a small tip from an elementary teacher.

It depends on the job you are aiming for and the types of diseases you want to find cures for.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get into a good college without declaring a major.  The best choice would be a school associated with a hospital, or one that offers medical degrees.  Colleges have a core of classes you will need to take regardless of the track you finally take.  Start on those classes and at the same time, become friendly with your advisor, career counselors, and your professors (if they are accessible).  Don't listen to just one person.  Get as much information as you can, and college is the best place to start.  <br>  <br>  By the time you need to declare a major you should be all set.|`|xIisVcLTaa	Off the top of my head I would say microbiology.

It is required for non-native applicants at many English-speaking colleges and universities. Additionally, institutions such as government agencies, businesses, or scholarship programs may require this test. A TOEFL score is valid for two years and then is deleted from the official database. Colleges and universities usually consider only the most recent TOEFL score.<br>  <br>  The TOEFL test is a registered trademark of Educational Testing Service (ETS) and is administered worldwide.

Stuff that can be folded, or crumpled, or taped together, or drawn on.  <br>  <br>  Be on the lookout for free supplies of stuff in unexpected places.  Those centerpieces at the luncheon.  Are they just going to throw them away?  Which parts could you use in your classroom?  The glass stones could make good counters.  Or part of an art project. Those paper cups would make good sorting containers.  The strings of beads?  Surely you can do something with the beads.<br>  <br>  Are these coffee stir straws just here for the taking?  What could I do with 20 or 30 of these babies?  (I justify looting items available to the public as a case of involuntary support for our schools.)<br>  <br>  Pennies have many uses.  Egg cartons are very useful.  <br>  Paper towel and toilet paper rolls are a classic.  Ask kids to bring them.  <br>  <br>  How many ways could you use dry beans in your classroom?  Weights for a balance?  Sorting different types? Counters?  <br>  Rice works great for measuring volume, and you don't get too upset if it gets spilled. Or you could bury stuff in it and have students search for it.  Hey, I just thought of that!<br>  How many other uses are there for these cheap, easy to store staples from the grocery store?<br>  <br>  How 'bout pictures, decorations, things to look at?  Some magazines like Smithsonian have full page pictures of interesting stuff and many libraries get rid of their old magazines through magazine exchanges where people drop off their old magazines and you can get them for free.<br>  <br>  Long sleeve men's button-up shirts bought cheap at Goodwill, or better yet donated by student's parents of other teachers, are automatic art smocks when the kids put them on backwards.<br>  <br>  The possibilities in rubber bands are limited only by our imaginations.<br>  It amazing how may different things you can do with drinking straws.<br>  <br>  My point isn't to get these specific things, but to keep your mind and eyes open to possibilities that might be useful in the classroom.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

In many, if not most, good Ph.D. programs, many of the students are accepted with stipends and assistantships which will pay for their tuition and basic expenses.  If you have been an outstanding student at good universities in your home country, apply to good Ph.D. programs and, if you are accepted, you are likely to get a financial aid package which will pay your tuition, at the very least.  This isn't true of undergraduate, master's, or professional school programs, but it is the case for Ph.Ds.

hWiEZJDuaa	hello<br>  im 16 and from the UK<br>  i study physics, maths, english language, physical education, media studies, English literature and Motor vehicles.<br>  <br>  In physics we are studying electricity, particle physics and vector and scalar forces.<br>  <br>  In maths we are studying sin, cos and tan problems like you, we are also dealing with polynomials and statistics<br>  <br>  In computer we learn how to create programs e.g. data capture forms and such. But most people my age are doing the same as you on excel, powerpoint and word etc.<br>  <br>  In media studies we are learning about mass media and how it affects different areas of society etc. <br>  <br>  <br>  Overall i think that we are studying at about the same level there are just slight variations in what we are actually learning. Although I am pretty sure that you are trying a lot harder to do well than most people in my country, not many people here care about their education it seems.

bZud91iuaa	All of the freedoms we have, have been tenaciously earned over the centuries from those who would, for various reasons suppress those freedoms.  Freedom to practice religion, freedom to pursue life and included in these freedoms is the right to free speech. This first amendment freedom has been hotly debated many times and has caused many people some unpleasant consequences supporting this right.  In your case however, I feel you're asking two questions.<br>  <br>  1. If I disagree with what a teacher said, is it ok to let them know that I disagree and carry on an intelligent discourse with them? The answer to this is of course, yes.It's called learning and mutual respect.<br>  <br>                                                     OR<br>  <br>  2. Is it ok to be disrespectful and a act like a jerk because the teacher caught you doing something you should not be doing and you think the right of free speech gives you the opportunity to embarrass him or her.  To which the answer is no. As I stated before, free speech comes with consequences, so be careful what you ask for.  There is a difference between intelligently talking to someone, and talking back to someone. The first usually gets you more and earns respect, the latter just shows how immature you really are.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	What a joke. It's no wonder the country is in such a mess when children think they can be rude to parents and teachers. When I was at school, the teacher was in charge and everyone knew that. If you didn't do as you were told then you'd be caned. If you went home and told your parents, you'd be punished again. These days, if a teacher dares even to tell a pupil off his chav parents will go to the school to remonstrate with the teacher. The actress who plays the headmistress in the television programme Waterloo Road was interviewed on television. I was horrified when she said that they receive many letters from children who say that it is true to life. Heaven help us if that truly is indicative of what happens in British schools these days.|`|o3Jpfflgaa	No.<br>  <br>  Freedom of speech applies to a citizen's right to openly disagree with his or her government's policies and actions.  I'd suggest you read the American Bill of Rights and try to comprehend the CONTEXT in which it was written (i.e., the suppression of public speaking topics and the right to gather peaceably under British monarchial laws in and prior to the 18th century).<br>  <br>  If society had no rules and no obedience requirements, such as basic things like a teacher's authority in the classroom, that would quickly be extended to no rules against any misbehavior.  A civilized society has to have rules in order to survive.|`|va8quhPtaa	If it is so then definitely it is wrong.

He is a sheperd boy who wanted to go to Egypt because of buried treasure. Instead of ignoring like other dreams, Santiago decides to go in search of the treasure. Along the way he begins to grow up and become wise in the ways of the world.<br>  <br>  Melchizedek, the old king- The old king comes to Santiago the day after his unusual dream, and tells him that he has succeeded in discovering his “Personal Legend”. He helped Santiago in making the decision to go look for his treasure, and although Santiago does not know it, the king is a god.<br>  <br>  The Crystal Merchant- The Crystal Merchant hires Santiago after he is robbed in Africa. Santiago has given up on his treasure and begins to change the shop. The merchant is a kind man who is fair to Santiago, and even though he is afraid of change, he takes Santiago’s advice about the shop. And because of his advices, the old store became popular and money began pouring in, so the shopkeeper is very grateful to Santiago.<br>  <br>  The Englishman- Santiago met and became friend with the Englishman on right before the caravan across the desert started. The Englishman has spent years and fortunes in finding his own Personal Legend to learn alchemy, and is on his way to find an alchemist at an oasis. <br>  <br>  Fatima- Fatima is a young girl at the oasis. She is very attractive, and as soon as Santiago sees her he loves her, and never wants to leave the oasis. She loves Santiago as well, and convinces him that he needs to go searching for his treasure, that she will wait for him to come back.<br>  <br>  The Alchemist- The Alchemist is a wizard at the oasis who helps Santiago on the other half of his journey across the desert. He helps teach Santiago about the Soul of the World, and also warns the boy that right before he’s about to discover his treasure he will be tested hardest. He also did alchemy for Santiago just to show him it’s possible to turn minerals into gold.<br>  <br>  What are the symbols in the story?<br>  <br>  The omen is an important symbol in the story because in the story the omen is somewhat a guide that helps you to get your “personal legend”. And since everyone is an omen, it means that everyone is helping you achieve your personal legend.<br>  <br>  <br>  What is the significance of the Gold?<br>  <br>   The gold was the treasure in the story. It was the goal of Santiago after he had seen the dream at the beginning of the story.<br>  What is the significance of the Alchemist?<br>  <br>   Since everyone is an omen, the alchemist helped Santiago reach his purpose in his life or his personal legend.<br>  <br>  How did it affect the Protagonist?<br>  <br>   It changed the way he thought of life. He found his true love which was Fatima. And especially, he found his “personal legend” in life.<br>  <br>  What is the novel’s theme?<br>  <br>  The theme is following your dreams no matter what happens.<br>  <br>  How can you relate it in your life?<br>  <br>   Like in the story, you must achieve your “personal legend”, so what I can relate in my life is that I will never give up no matter how hard or complicated the task is and remember like in the story, the universe is always helping you achieve your “personal legend” in life.<br>  <br>  What is the countries present condition and problems?<br>  <br>   The economic crisis is not only a big problem not only in the Philippines but also worldwide.<br>  <br>  What are the solutions of the world crisis?<br>  <br>  One solution is you must work hard to achieve your “personal legend” in life and never give up.|`|HcU9M0XRaa	hi are you grade seven in lsgh we both have the same prob. whats ur name|`|cfCwiBe1aa	Do your homework you lying, cheating, amoral child!!!

Older men were raised to be respectful and always try to make a good impression (not that they always do however).  I know when I always meet someone new I refer to them as dear.  I'm not sure why I do it - it just seems to slip out before I realize it.  Depending on what kind of prior contact you had before you met, he might simply be fond of you
HXVYsSVeaa	The last persuasive talk i did was on Animal Testing. Its common, but still slightly unknown and you can find plenty of useful info on it.
uZaGBeYbaa	No he is not too old.  <br>  <br>  However, he will need to apply and graduate with a bachelor's degree from a 4 year university.  He will need to have excellent grades and MCAT scores to apply and get accepted into medical school, which is very competitive.  Unless you are independently wealthy, most people have to take out loans to pay for medical school which is usually in the range of $140,000-200,000 depending on the medical school.  Then after medical school he will have to apply for residency training in a particular field of medicine which can range from 3-5 years of additional training before he can practice as a doctor in the US.  Thus bringing the grand total to 11-13 years (college, medical school, and residency).  During residency training you will work up to 80 hours/week and get paid $40,000-45,000/year before taxes.  <br>  <br>  If he is willing to put in the effort and time with no guarantees of getting into medical school, then he should do it.  However, it is a huge time, physical, emotional, and life-long commitment.  <br>  <br>  My advice is if you can see yourself doing anything else, then do it.  If not, then go for it.|`|qBkJAlQ1aa	at age 26, yes he can...<br>  make sure he gets good grades, pass MCAT, gets admitted to a med school, pass all subjects, graduate, pass medical licensure exam, he's now a doctor.<br>  <br>  next, work his way to admission to a residency training program in a hospital so he'll be a specialist.<br>  <br>  He needs loads of patience, dedication, determination, industry, inspiration, compassion and good health.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  anvil ltd.|`|eL268hETaa	No one is ever too old to go to college for any reason.  Oprah Winfrey just had a man on her show recently who learned how to read at age 96.  The day you stop learning is the day you die...<br>  <br>  Competition to get into medical school in the USA is quite stiff, and it requires one helluva lot of money.  Depending on the school one graduates from, you may not even be able to get a job in the USA when you're done.  One of my best friends graduated College in Florida, went to Medical School in Guadalajara Mexico, and then was forced to do an internship program in New Jersey because of where she graduated from.  She was spanish-speaking, but also American citizen, so it was easier and CHEAPER for her to attend medical school in Mexico.  There are lots of Pre-Med prerequisites also, depending on where you apply. <br>  <br>  Even so, do not discourage anyone from trying.  Where there's a will there's a way.  Perhaps talking to your local college guidance counselor might give you a better handle on where to start.|`|vt8KPC5Waa	26 years old is not too old to become a doctor, you will find there are a lot of older students in medical school. <br>  <br>  First thing you need to do is enroll in an actual college.  You will never get into a medical school with an online degree, because online colleges don't offer science labs.  Science labs are a requirement at all medical schools.  <br>  <br>  You need to have a bachelors degree with all the required science courses completed.  You will also have to take the MCAT exam for admissions.  Your best bet is to go to medical school websites and check out the requirements.  You will also need some volunteer work, usually at a hospital.  <br>  <br>  Most importantly do your research and decide if its truely what you want to do.  Sure doctors make a lot of money but their lifestyle doesn't allow them to enjoy their money as much as another profession would.  If your in it for the money, there are other fields that pay well.<br>  <br>  Check out websites for non-traditional med students<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oldpremeds.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldpremeds.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nontraditionalmedicalstudent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nontraditionalmedicalstudent....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amsa.org/premed/premedguide/nontraditional.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amsa.org/premed/premedguide/n...</a>

zZxX5PXBaa	Universities used to teach two sorts of philosophy, natural philosopy, and moral philosophy.<br>  <br>  Natural philosophy is what we would now call physical science, physics in particular. Moral philosophy is what we not tend to call just 'philosophy', and it includes the tradition departments of philosophy, epistomology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, and so on.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, philosophy departments in universities tend to preoccupy themselves with only a very narrow selection from those traditional issues, and often with only a very narrow part of the traditional canon from the Pre-Socratics up to the modern day. They tend to be preoccupied with analytic philosophy, with logic, and with the analysis of language .. by which they often mean languages other than natural or spoken languages, such as mathematical languages.<br>  <br>  The traditional elements of philosophy, and the traditional texts, are still very much alive, however. They tend now to be more studied in arts or social sciences departments, in English, History, Social Theory, Politics, Gender Studies, and so on. These departments concern themselves with how we understand society, how we evaluate evidence about social situations, how we make decisions, and especially with questions about what is 'right'. They also all tend to have more of an interest in the social function of texts, and in the ways that particular texts have been interpreted historically.<br>  <br>  To philosophise is to do all those things, thinking either privately or socially about what is right, what is true, what is good, and so on. Discussiing how societies organise themselves formally or informally, how we manage the difference between our life in the public sphere and our private lives ... All of this. You can philosophise formally, writing out your ideas and discussing them with others, or you can philosophise informally over a pint in the pub, or you can philosophise privately while half your mind is on the game on TV.<br>  <br>  So, secondarily, 'philosophise' can also mean, in some contexts, to chew the fat, to speculate lazily ... it can be ironic, sarcastic ... gently teasing or quite unpleasant.|`|d46b9fd80ce5d074ba7fa3ce9e65d025aa	To philosophize is to ask questions, primarily, searching for an underlying principle behind things.  If that sounds like a definition of science, then it should be no surprise that science used to be called "natural philosophy".<br>  <br>  There are all kinds of root questions.  Just as "natural philosophy" seeks to understand the governing principles behind nature, "religious philosophy seeks to understand the nature of God", "Aesthetics" seeks to understand "why is something beautiful".<br>  <br>  Moral philosophy seeks to determine what are, or should be, the rules we live by, what (should) govern our behavior.  Is it "right" to kill one person to save thousands?  Which is right: "do unto others" or "turn the other cheek"?  Or it is situational, and why.<br>  <br>  Note that in 2000+ years of discussing philosophy, not one issue has ever been firmly resolved.<br>  <br>  ????|`|AA11071860	Moral philosophy, we should behave in ways best for our social group, or society. When the USA was created in 1776, philosophers from England and France philosophized about the best society to have for the masses. This was called the age of Enlightenment.

If your parents are married to each other, you list both of their incomes and information.  IF they are divorced or separated you list the "Set" of parents (parent and step-parent) that you lived with the most recently.

I don't understand why anyone would want to teach below the college level - and I only teach there because I don't have to put up with any crap they throw at me.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	I think it is time for government to get out of the education business.  Let the teachers go back to be able to discipline students with swats on the hands and/or behinds.  Then let's put  a lot of blame where it belongs - on the parents.  Far too many think their child/children can do no wrong, even when confronted with proof of wrongdoing. When I was in school, it was a disaster to be sent to the principal's office, because he would contact the parents and it was worse when you got home. Parents should be responsible for discipline and let the teachers do what they were trained to do - teach and educate.|`|zw0YYjYKaa	I think thats horrible. I'm going to be a 2nd grade teacher. Sometimes, the teachers are just to nice. It sounds weird but if they don't gain respect things like that are gonna happen. I think it is very disrespectful, and mean for them to do that. It's shocking. I would have written all of them up. No teacher deserves that, especially if they are as awesome as you say.|`|iN0cyZoTaa	I think the little punks should be severely reprimanded.  Hopefully that teacher won't let them get away with being that disrespectful. That's shameful behavior.|`|Qnswjc6kaa	Kids at your school throw things at teachers?! Something is seriously wrong... why don't your teachers use discipline? It's possible that the rubber band attack had nothing to do with your teacher, and that the 5th graders were trying to emulate the 8th graders. It's also possible that the 5th graders were provoked. You'll never know until you get both sides of the story. Why do people your age throw things at teachers? Perhaps the 5th graders attacked for the same reasons. 5th graders are only 3 years younger than you, and their age doesn't make them innocent. Preschoolers are known to BITE each other.<br>  <br>  The idea that each generation is more misbehaving than the one before it is very old. Often you will hear the elderly go on and on about how they respected their elders when they were our age and such. What about all of the rebellion that happened in the 50's? Motorcycles,   leather jackets, cigarettes, rock and roll? What about the 60's and 70's and the excessive drug abuse? What about the 80's with its intense grunge death metal? What do we do know? Well, we go to some night club and pretend to be "gangsta"s.|`|wfsh1Irkaa	First off, I have no idea what school or school district you attend where students throw things at the teachers?  I'm currently an elementary school teacher working for the Los Angeles School District.  It can get tough working in the South Central area but I've never encountered such disrespect from students.  I've have students walked out on me in afterschool detention but that's as bad as it gets.  No things flying so far, thank goodness.  Yes, it is horrible for any teacher to have things thrown at them.  It is horrible to have anything thrown at anyone, period!!!|`|58rTOtr1aa	Why do people do this?

I hope those students are punished for that. It is amazing how rude and disrespectful the children of this generation. <br>  They are lucky that they have such a nice teacher.
2KjBXjLKaa	Congrats, wow that is an expensive school -- I think. I have no advice for you as my B. Sc. was from the U of Nebraska 53 years ago tomorrow on Feb 4, 1956. Tuition was $80/semester and the dorm was the same the first year, then a cafeteria was added and the price went up. I worked in a drive-in the first year for 65 cents/hour, and then the last years corrected papers for a drafting proff at 90 cents/hour.    Scholarships for Tuition helped out if grades were kept up and I was able to live and make it through school on $650 - $900/ year. ROTC helped with income in the junior and senior years. Student loans were unknown in those days.     NM tech would be less than half of your college at $18,000 (non-resident) as opposed to your cost of $45,000 for similar schools as Cal Tech or MIT. Your choice will be dependent on your planned major. Probably going to school in the small NM town of Socorro would be a real culture shock, the the school is small.    The best of luck to you and financing your education. It might take long time to pay off a student loan that costs more than your first home.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	First off . . . Congratulations!!    Your EFC (Estimated Family Contribution) is 0.  That's good.  That means they don't expect you to pay anything.  You will qualify for grants (don't have to pay anything back), loans (gotta pay these back), and work study (jobs at school).  Take all the grants that you're eligible for.  Take as few loans as possible.  If you can make it without taking out loans, you'll be in good shape.  If they offer work study, take it.  Even if you decide you don't want to work, take it.  That way, if you do decide you want a job, you'll get first crack.  I work at a university and when we want to hire student workers, we always ask for work study students first.    There are a lot of grants out there and most of them are based on need.  There's the Pell Grant, which is a federal program and they'll tell you about it.  Many states have grants (here in Wisconsin, we have the WHEG - Wisconsin Higher Education Grant - which is for low-income people).  There may also be grants for underrepresented people (minorities, first generation college student, etc.).  Often, there are special grants that help cover the difference between public and private colleges.  There are also grants you can apply for, just like scholarships.  Search online and apply for these, too.    Finally, your award letter will tell you how much you'll get from government grants, how much you'll be allowed to borrow, and how much work study money you'll have to work with.    Good luck to you!|`|1yqucDzaaa	You can apply for Federal grants (free money from the government), state grants (free money from the state), and then the rest you can get in student loans. I'm in PA, so I'm not sure exactly the steps you would have to take, but you can get student loans from any bank.     and.. CONGRATS! :)|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	Did you get a financial aid package from the college?    Unfortunately, with a 0 EFC, you will not be able to afford most private colleges. You'll get maximum federal aid, but that's a drop in the bucket at a $46K school. It's a $4700 Pell grant, loans up to $5500 freshmen year and a work study job.    If this is not a college that meets 100% of need it's probably unrealistic. No undergrad school is worth huge loans and there's a good chance you'd have a very hard time repaying it.    So if this is not a school offering big grants, look for another school.
hEFthejvaa	i'm sure of it. most likely there will be a lot of drop outs from nursing b/c it's a pretty tough major (but not as tough as med school, it's the WORST).<br>  you should take a semester of english or better yet something science related (like biology or chemistry). with a science major you won't be behind b/c you'll be taking some of the courses that are required for nursing as well.<br>  so yea just do something else for a semester (or a year, you're choice) then switch back to nursing as soon as you can. best of luck!|`|AXes50RBaa	if you go into health science, you can still take classes required for a nurse. you can actually become a nurse or other occupations if you major in this field.|`|Qu9K1p8Qaa	You can change your major at anytime... they're aren't any restrictions against that.  However, since you are planning on changing it to nursing I would recommend majoring in a more relevant field.  For example, biology, chemistry, etc.  This will help you to get your pre-req's for nursing because it will cover the scientific classes you will have to take in order to be a nurse.  If you're interested in English too though, go ahead and major in it.  You might end up deciding to pursue something in that field rather than nursing.  I would also suggest that you look at other schools that offer a nursing degree and would be able to accept you into their program sooner.  You never know what the future is going to bring.. so don't worry too much, just be prepared to change your mind about things. Best wishes to you!|`|fYpyrLvaaa	That doesn't makes since (the part about changing to English so that you can easily transfer into Nursing).  You should major in a Science-related field such as Biology or Chemistry, that way when you change majors to Nursing, you would have already taken your pre-reqs.

juqGUHIcaa	"K" here is in reference to "Kindergarten." Kindergarten is the level directly before First Grade. In the U.S., schooling goes from First Grade to Twelfth Grade. So, Kindergarten prepares students for those twelve years, building such skills as reading, basic math, computer skills (sometimes), hands-on skills, etc. It's a fundamental year for child development.  Pre-K is the year (or two) before that. Also known as "Preschool," Pre-K prepares toddlers for Kindergarten. They learn shapes, letters, the alphabet, sharing, cooperation, etc. Just the very most basic stuff that will allow them to get along well in Kindergarten.  In some places, Pre-K may be one or two years, or optional altogether as to the discretion of the parents. I myself took only one year of Pre-K while both of my siblings took two.|`|XbeYZLDGaa	Preschool is an early childhood program in which children combine learning with play in a program run by professionally trained adults. Children are most commonly enrolled in preschool between the ages of three and five, though those as young as two can attend some schools. Preschools are different from traditional day care in that their emphasis is learning and development rather than enabling parents to work or pursue other activities.|`|0CsMa3T3aa	Pre-K can stand for preschool.

Today they are often no more than child care facilities with pretensions.    Our federal government used to fund a program called Head Start, which allowed pre-school children in inner cities to go to pre-school for a year.  It was found to be a very cost-effective program.  Kids who got this training did better in school, had a lower dropout rate, a lower rate of crime, drugs, teen pregnancy, etc.  But the program was defunded by GHW Bush (GW Bush's dad) in the 1980s because, he said, it showed no -immediate- benefit.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Pre-schools (sometimes called nursery schools) are just that: an opportunity to get a child used to a classroom setting, and begin embracing the idea of group learning. For those with little contact with others their age, it also helps them learn how to be social.

Actually there are very few supplies that you need for most typical preK programs.  A regular sized backpack...not a school-agers...a bit smaller but not those little tiny ones (as cute as they are).  We send home work that often is on 9x13 construction paper and often have notes and such coming home so the backpack should be able to fit into that.  Remember also, come winter, shoes and snowpants will need to fit into the back pack.    Regular tennis shoes are fine.  For everyone involved...look into elastic or velcro shoes so she can be independent.      Clothes:  it's kind of nice to choose a few "sets" of play clothes for school.  Don't spend that much money...she will most likely get them dirty :-)  I say "sets" because it will help getting out of the house in the morning if you provide 2 sets and have her choose which of the two she wants to wear...easier on you and her both!    Art supplies and such like crayons, pencils and all are usually provided...though some preschools ask for "donations" at the beginning of the year of basic supplies, kleenex, etc.    Even if it is a full day program...most preschool will provide the nap mats...but I'm sure you don't have to worry about it for a 1/2 day program.  Sometimes they suggest you bring a blanket.  Not huge, mind you...one that fits folded in a gallon or 2 gallon size ziploc easily is good.  You might want to have her choose a "special" blanket.      Maybe you can make a "remember me" small craft project with your picture that she can have in her back pack for days she is having a rough day and needs your smile :-)    Good luck!|`|Z5eaybI0aa	My daughter is 5years old in a full day of Prek.

ii7TbH2Aaa	Water molecules are "thicker" or closer together than the molecules in ice.  When water freezes, it expands because it captures air molecules in it.  This is why when you look at an ice cube you can see frozen bubbles in it.  The bubbles increase the volume, but they do not add to the weight or density.  Because of this, you could have a 5X5 ft block of ice, and a 5X5 ft bucket of water, and the water will weigh more.

7149XmBqaa	Sounds to me as if this school is shooting itself in the foot.  There is no way they will win this case, unless their allegations of defamation and libel are true, which seems unlikely.  And to answer the question, yes, charter schools should be able to sue, but only if they have a case.  This doesn't sound like a case to me, and public schools are different, naturally.  Any activity funded by taxpayer monies would not have that recourse when taxpayers are only making sure their money is not wasted.  Private organizations have that right, even if it is frivolous.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	It's hard to say from this article if there is reason for a lawsuit. If the parents sent out emails to people of authority in which Browns reputation was damaged, and those alegations were false, there would be grounds for a lawsuit. No matter who you are, you can't just go and tell people "So and so is a bad person and they do illegal things" if you have no proof. Doing so is ALOT different than "Just asking questions" But in this news article we don't know what was said in the emails. Also The school may not win because a deflamation of character suit has to prove that Brown's reputation has actually been damaged to the point where she either lost her job, or lost income or potential income of some kind. If she was no longer able to get a job or lost her job due to false acusations, then she would have grounds to recieve money. So really it all depends on how things were worded in the emails. The difference might be as simple as "She has..." vs "I think she might have"|`|8j7FCEOraa	Too much to read    Even if they were sued, I doubt any judge would let it go threw. Parents have a right to know whats going on in the school system their children attend.    And even if they did get sued, the community, PTA's, would have a riot. They wouldn't let their injustice go unnoticed.

But you have to know she feels that way because she wants the very best for you and she knows how tough things will be for you without a proper education.

High school really isn't that difficult if you apply yourself even a little.  Thank of how wonderful you (and your mother) will feel once you finally graduate.  Just make school your priority for just a little while and before you know it, you will be done.

You don't have to pay back.|`|pvezh17Maa	A grant is free money that doesn't need to be paid back.  A Pell grant for low income students is an example.<br>  <br>  A student loan (taken out by the student or parent) can be subsidized or unsubsidized and both need to be repaid.  A subsidized loan does not accrue interest until the student ends his education, by graduating or withdrawal.  The re-payment begins about 6 months later.  An unsubsidized loan begins to accrue interest as soon as the loan is disbursed and is to be repaid starting 6 months after graduation.<br>  <br>  A scholarship is free money given to the student for excellence in some field from various sources (like Rotary Clubs or from the high school they attended).  It does not need to be repaid.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	A scholarship is usually at least partly based on merit.  That means you need good grades to get one.<br>  Grants are mostly need-based and have very little to do with grades.  However, most of them will be taken away if you fail too many classes.<br>  Both scholarships and grants don't have to be paid back.  Loans have to be paid back.  Loans also have very little to do with grades.  Most are need-based, but you can get private loans that will be based on your credit rating.

8fe498528738ccf0049b946afdfa827faa	The chance of successfully getting into a vet school depends on a number of<br>  factors and the weight put on these factors varies from school to school.<br>  <br>  The single most important thing is to make sure you are a resident of a<br>  state that has a vet school or a state that has a contract with another vet<br>  school to accept students.  Veterinary schools almost all limit enrollment<br>  to students in one of these two situations.<br>  <br>  Most of the veterinary schools will give you the formula they use to<br>  evaluate students. Some schools use a point system and by adding up the<br>  points for experiences, like military service, working a veterinary<br>  hospital, etc., you can figure out how that will affect your chances. The<br>  rest of the weight is usually on degrees obtained, grade point,<br>  standardized testing or some other semi-objective criteria.<br>  <br>  At most of the schools, persistence will usually work in your favor,<br>  too.  Applying more than once or twice does show a really strong desire to<br>  get in, especially if combined with some sort of classwork to improve grade<br>  point or to get a degree in a related field.<br>  <br>  Contacting the college with a veterinary school that accepts students from<br>  the state you are in is the first step. Someone there will tell you how to<br>  go about applying and what the basic requirements are..<br>  <br>  The current situation may be different than when I went to school, but I<br>  really think that is unlikely. The problem with veterinary school admission<br>  is this --  veterinary schools do more than just give preference to<br>  students from their state, most of them limit admission to students from<br>  their own state OR students from states that make a contract with a<br>  veterinary school to admit a certain number of students from that state. It<br>  isn't possible to get into the school if you do not fit one of those criteria.<br>  <br>  When I went to school at Iowa State, there were a certain number of<br>  students who came from Nebraska because Nebraska paid Iowa State to take<br>  them, for instance. Iowa State had 5 available places for out of state<br>  students from states that did not have contracts with the school. And this<br>  was a lot then -- it was one of the few schools that let anybody in that<br>  wasn't from the state the school was in or from a state that paid for the<br>  right to admit some students. If I remember correctly, there were something<br>  like 3500 applicants for those five seats the year I got into vet school.<br>  Students from states like New Jersey, which didn't have a vet school and<br>  didn't buy slots at other vet schools were just about out of luck. They had<br>  to go somewhere and establish residency to have a reasonable chance of<br>  getting into vet school.<br>  <br>  The odds of getting into vet school if you live in a state with a vet<br>  school are lots better than that. Usually around 1 in 3 qualified<br>  applicants gets in and some years it has been as low as 1 in 2.<br>  <br>  That is why you can't be from Iowa and decide to go to Colorado State to<br>  vet school. Or from Missouri and decide to go to Ohio State. If your state<br>  has a vet school, you just about have to go to that school.<br>  <br>  <br>  Visit this site for further assisstance;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vetinfo.com/vetschol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetinfo.com/vetschol.html</a>
H8moHsL7aa	As someone who studied successfully in aged care, I would make the following suggestions:<br>  <br>  A concentration or memory type game that has the questions on one set of cards and the answers on another. The cards could be a seperate colour for Questions and Answers or a Q or an A on the back of the cards.  <br>  <br>  However many cards you have say 20, which would be 10 questions and 10 answers, these would be shuffled, and then turned upide down on a table. <br>  <br>  The players would have to turn a question card up and read the question, and then choose an Answer card, and read the Answer.<br>  <br>  If they have chosen the correct set, they keep the pair and have another go.  If they have not they replace the cards in their positions face down, and the next person tries. And so on, until all cards are gone.<br>  <br>  The winner of the game is the one with the most sets, however all players and spectators are also winners as they have learned.<br>  <br>  If the aim is to help people consolidate their learning, they will already know the answers, but the competition will consolidate, and if playing the game with others they are all learning at each turn of the cards, as they are already seeking the correct answer or remembering where it was if it was turned over before.   <br>  <br>  One could also have Quiz type questions, with multiple choice answers, or a Quiz which is one on one.  An A list and a B List of say  25 questions.  or sets of 10 questions, for 10 quizzes (100 questions) so that more choices of questions are there for more participants and variety in the cards.  Of course you're future mum in law would have to come up with the questions.<br>  <br>  I would suggest the following sources to her:<br>  <br>  Look through your notes, your handouts, your set readings so far from classes and form questions from them.<br>  <br>  Cover all areas of aged care such as personal care, manual handling, mental health of the elderly, dementia, diet, mobility, access to facilities, living wills, first aid, what to do in an emergency, the legal issues etc...<br>   <br>  You can either make the questions with short answers, so the cards aren't too big, or have bigger cards wth fuller answers.<br>  <br>  I would probably go for one part of the answer like:<br>  <br>  Question: What does the A mean in DRABC in First Aid?<br>  <br>  Answer: Check and clear the airways of the injured person for any obstacles.<br>  <br>  I hope it works and I hope you enjoy your work with the elderly.

zntOXCfuaa	Although this seems horrible at the moment, maybe this is a chance for you to start over fresh.  If you're going to enroll in a different school, start new.  Don't hold any of the same grudges and feelings you had at a previous school.  Even though teachers at a new school might know your history (because of your records), the other kids won't.  Start new and try to do everything to the best of your ability, so that you won't have more regrets.  You didn't say how old you are, but I'm going to assume you are still quite young, since you're still in school.  You have so much ahead of you, and so much time to find out who you are and what your calling in life is.  Don't get frustrated now.  Take a breather, get yourself back together, and do something great with your life.  Good luck!

Because to be a primary teacher it is the course that you take in university and college that really matters. Just tell her to pick what she is interested in and make sure that subject is considered as a 'good' SUbJECT.

CJqK40uFaa	the best way to oppress someone is to make them feel inferior, however if a person is knowledgeable then they will know they are not inferior, cuz no one is inferior to another person, so giving slaves education would be incompatible, cuz if a slave had education, they would not feel oppressed, and since they would be smarter they would gain the ways to rise up, so thats why they tried to hold education back from slaves.     he also said once you learn to read you will truly be free, which is the same thing...|`|PRg9UgOlaa	Pretty much that the slaves did not need/deserve an education.

xJoMSkI5aa	(Letter 2.4)     <br>  <br>  Thought: Walton describes his desire to travel and explore the world. He is an exploratory person both in terms of physical travel and the mental exploration of intellectual discovery.<br>  <br>  I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained  ... of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend--his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly--I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel shouldbe freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.

04hTn3vSaa	Well, your GPA is right about in the average range for accepted UCD students, however, your SAT score is far on the low side. It will highly depend on the major you applied into, however, so if you posted that, it might be more helpful. Since there are serious budget cuts with the UC system, and one of the cuts is to admit less students, I'd say that UC Davis is probably a reach for you, however, I'd say UC Irvine is more likely.<br>  <br>  (Volunteering for community service is too late. They probably won't consider it if you call them and add it to your application. ) Disregard that, I did not read the part where you said that you were a Junior. However, it still, in a sense is too late. For the little importance that ECs play in the UC admissions process, they prefer to see someone who has participated in a specific sport, art, club, or community service consistently throughout high school.<br>  <br>  If you really want to increase your chances, try to get an 1800+ on your SAT. Believe me, it is possible to raise it that much with simply one more test. I went from a 1710 to a 1910 with about one month's study time. Get a private SAT tutor or buy a prep book!<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I am adding a link to the site on the UCD website for selection criteria. You will see that it is generally grades and test scores that are important and that ECs have very little importance. This is honestly the BIGGEST misconception people have about the UC system. While it is no recommended to do so, you can technically get into pretty much any UC with no ECs if you have a 4.4 UC gpa and a 2300+ on the SAT...however, most students with stats like that are hoping to be accepted into an Ivy League or other top private university, so that explains why they usually have pages and pages of ECs.<br>  <br>  <br>  and they DO look at your major when you apply. I attended a seminar given by someone on the UC Davis Admissions Committee and she specifically said that when applying to UC Davis, the best idea is to apply into your first choice major and then an alternate major that is completely unrelated to your first major. She said that this increases the chances of admission because if you are not fit to be a Biology Major, you are probably not fit to be a Chemistry major either. When applying, you are almost in competition with the other people that are looking after going into that same major. This is something that may not have been true for admissions 5+ years ago, but over time, it has become more and more important which major you apply into.|`|vNnvpLKBaa	no start doing that now, and in the summer<br>  <br>  lucky you Im wishing my gpa was that high|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	First of all, it's not too late to get in some community service. You aren't going to fill out an application until this fall, so it won't hurt at all to try to get in significant amounts of community service (more than just an hour here and there).<br>  <br>  Unless they have changed, UCD admits roughly half of its students based on GPA and SAT alone (that is, the students with the best GPA and SAT). For the rest, they look at the whole picture: your community service/ extracurriculars, your admissions essay, how rigorous your coursework was, etc. In your case, you have a pretty good GPA and courseload, modest SAT scores, and not much activities. To best improve your chances to getting into UCD, I would say focus on taking the SAT again and trying for better scores, and focus on writing a kickass essay.<br>  <br>  It's very difficult to say what your chances are. You will be compared to everyone else who applies, basically. It is true that UC may lower admissions rates due to the economy. However, it is also very possible that less people will apply this year, due to the economy, and that more people will choose to go to a JC and transfer.<br>  <br>  By the way, ELC only means you are eligible for a UC, which means that you may not get into UCD but you would definitely get into UCR or UCM. Also, UCI and UCD are pretty close to each other in many ways, including what kinds of applications that they accept or reject. Also, it doesn't matter what major you declare when you apply. If you are applying for a popular major like psychology, an unpopular major like comparative literature, or even undeclared, they will look at your application the same way.<br>  <br>  Thanks Luno for the more updated information.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Don't just take the SAT over and over.  Colleges will see all your tries.  Prepare for it before taking it the first time and then you'll only need one or two attempts.  Applications are due in January for most schools, or you can apply in Nov for early decision (but you're obligated to go to to that school if they accept you).  Otherwise, you'll have a choice - when they send you an acceptance letter in the spring, they'll give you instructions on how to accept or turn them down.  Colleges have applications on their websites, and many accept the Common Application.|`|m8f7rnBEaa	You have a lot of questions about the admissions process.  Talk to your guidance counselor.  The SAT will now allow you to choose which score you reveal to colleges if you take it multiple times.  This is because they are losing market share to the ACT test, which has allowed that for some time.  When you sign up for the ACT, simply don't list any colleges to send the test to.  If you take the one in June, they send the results to you and only you.  If you take it in any other month and you don't choose to send it to a college, it will wind up going to your high school.  You can then direct the high school on where to send it and which score to send.  They say the ACT is easier for a lot of students because it is more like the kind of test you see in High School.  If you go in this direction, I recommend getting the Princeton Review book Cracking the ACT.  Most schools will accept either the ACT or the SAT.  Only some hyper competitive schools, such as Harvard or Yale, will demand an SAT.

You might get better answers if you ask this at <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> it's a community for fashion designers so I'm sure they will know more about fashion colleges.|`|LRbWZhvnaa	Prestigious UNIVERSITIES like the ones you mentioned DO NOT offer "fashion design." <br>  <br>  The best school, by far, for "fashion design" IS Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT); I think that it is LOCATED in New York. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, because fashion DESIGN is a competitive field to GET into, I suggest you attend USC, UCLA, Vassar, Dartmouth, HARVARD, Princeton, Yale, or any other regionally accredited college or university to earn a bachelor's degree in another field that interests you; such as visual arts, which would really compliment a fashion design interest. <br>  <br>  AFTER, you study that, you can go to fashion school. This way, you keep your options open for later and can do something ELSE if fashion design doesn't work OUT for you.|`|y1jB60Z1aa	If you wanna be a fashion designer you could go to the Philadelphia art institute. But i see you want to go to a big name school, so I'm not sure if they have good fashion programs, they are good academic schools.

hEFthejvaa	well you still have 2 years so surely you'll find something you like by the time you're a senior. as a sophomore i had no idea what i wanted to do i couldn't even pick a top 5, lol.<br>  so no worries be patient you should instead concentrate on getting good grades in high school. junior year & 1st semester of senior are critical for your GPA, but at least you can relax the last semester of your senior year.<br>  <br>  also, if you get any ideas of majors you want to apply for, try taking classes in your school that are similar to the major you thought of. by being curious it can narrow down your choices until you pick your final decision.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	Well, you need to consider the careers that you would be pursuing after getting any degree. It will help you in the long run and you would be able to decide it efficiently. Psychologists have a good great life. Thats my personal opinion. But you can change it according to your own interests and scopes. Do what you are passionate about. <br>  I'm giving you a link where you would also be able to apply for online degrees besides knowing more about degrees and careers.|`|3oz4r6Nraa	When you find that one thing you love, you'll just know.  I'm interested in pretty much everything under the sun, but when I started to do more and more work in political science and government in high school, I knew there was nothing else I wanted to do.  To plug my major, it relates a lot to History and even Anthropology... and oh, lots of drama! ;)  <br>  <br>  You don't have to know what you want to do before you go to college though.  I'm a junior and I have friends who have switched their majors three times by now, or entered wanting to do one thing and now are totally involved in something else.  Most colleges don't have you declare a major until your sophomore year.  It seems scary, but really, there are SO many people who have no idea what they want to do here.  I'd even say they're the majority!<br>  <br>  I would say to think a LOT about what classes you like best in high school.  I loved my science classes, but Social Studies and History came easier to me and I enjoyed it a lot more.  That was the homework I'd do without having to make myself do it, you know?  Also think  about where you see yourself being in a career.  Can you see yourself as a counselor?  Out in the field doing archaeological research?  Teaching as a college professor?  Also think practically - for example, Drama tends to be one of the least profitable majors and it's very hard to get a career in acting.  Psychology is somewhere you can make a lot of money.<br>  <br>  As for narrowing down colleges - the best way to do that, if you don't know what you want to do, is think about what part of the country you want to be in.  The beach?  The South?  The Northeast? California?  Once you have that basic idea it helps a lot.

gb9REJN4aa	What you're doing wrong is squaring incorrectly.    Your first step is correct:  (x - 4)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 6    But now you have to square the left-hand side:  (x - 4)(x - 4) = x^2 - 8x + 16 = x^2 + 2x + 6    I'm going to presume this was just an error, but if you don't know why  (x - 4)(x - 4) = x^2 - 8x + 16  then you should look up "squaring polynomials" or "multiplying polynomial expressions."    Anyhow, now you have  x^2 - 8x + 16 = x^2 + 2x + 6    Now solve, like you did. Subtract x^2 from both sides  -8x + 16 = 2x + 6    Put the variable terms on one side and the numerical terms on the other:  16 - 6 =8x + 2x  10 = 10x  x = 1

qSbNY5XPaa	Education itself is 100% wisdom: it aims to instill knowledge and understanding with the purpose of applying it to real life problems. But I think what you are getting at is the bigger picture: education is explicitly functional, but you only have to look at the number of highschool dropouts and shootings let alone the plagues of depression and stress to realise that there is something drastically wrong with the system. But what exactly is it? That is the trouble: the system explicitly appears okay, but the real drama is implicit. It is the finer points of knowledge, the moral applications, the understanding of the bigger picture, not just how to do maths. <br>  <br>  Wisdom incorporates knowledge, but sadly education doesn't necessarily incorporate wisdom. Universities are becoming degree-factories, schools are just the pre-processing stage. The product is the workforce, blind members of society. They are knowledgable but not wise. As you say, it is a psychological myopia.|`|Qnswjc6kaa	Yes. Modern education is all about memorization and regurgitation. There is no real thinking involved.

oZ39bLSkaa	Hi,<br>  Good for you for taking the initiative about doing something about your problem. It is never easy to be in a position where you are not feeling appreciated and loved. May I suggest seeking out the counselor? I am hoping the school has one and he/she is a wise and sensitive person who can at least listen to your troubles. Can you talk to your parents?<br>  <br>  Whether you should be home schooled or not depends on a few things. First of all, are your parents in a position to support you (affording the extra expense and staying home with you) in home schooling? One of them would have to be home for at least part of the day to guide you and hold you accountable. Even with online schooling where you are taught  and submit your assignments via the computer requires some supervision. So go to your local library and ask your librarian for a book that would give you information of the basics of home schooling. There are some options (I think K12 is one) that are free or inexpensive, so when/if you get to that point check it out. If you want to talk to your parents about home schooling it would be good for you to at least have some information in hand. Realistically, I do not think they would consider this year at all, asit is almost over, but it give you time to consider it for next year.<br>  <br>  As far as your social life: some people think home school by definition is isolation. It can be if you want it to be but it does not have to be! If you connect with home schoolers in your area you would possibly be able to do some classes together (called co-ops) go on field trips, have fund together and so on. You would likely make some close friends from this group. <br>  <br>  I understand this is a difficult time for you. Might I make a suggestion? Seek someone else in your school who also seems alone and in need  of a friend. Leave the "popular crowd" to their own drama, and see if you can make a valuable friend.<br>  <br>  Take cae and all the best|`|rTaaIXSuaa	The answer lies on a few factors.<br>  What do you parents think of this? Would they be the ones teaching you or are you considering doing an online distance learning type thing? Is cost an issue? Learning from home can range from $0-thousands. <br>  Homeschool isn't for everyone. You have to be much more self disciplined and motivated otherwise you will fall behind. <br>  I understand how you are feeling because my daughter was having a very difficult time adjusting to her new school and she would constantly beg me to take her out and be homeschooled. I finally had to take her feelings in consideration and decided to pull her out. She is doing so much better. <br>  Decide how you want your homeschooling to be. Distance learning is what my daughter is doing. It takes a load off of my shoulders because licensed teachers are teacher her via internet. <br>  Unschooling is where your teachers are your parents. This is where it can get expensive.|`|yJSPecgoaa	There is no question that some people are able to learn more effectively when removed from the distractions and drama that typify the high school environment.  This is especially true of individuals who are unusually sensitive to the goings-on around them.<br>  <br>  As a homeschooler, being removed from such negative distractions would very likely enable you to make far better progress academically.  However, you will need to be very self-directed and self-motivated in order to be successful at homeschooling.  <br>  <br>  At your age, your parents’ involvement will probably be minimal.  You will do most of the work yourself and most likely online.  Homeschooling laws vary by state, so you will want to first check out your state’s homeschooling laws and requirements.  To do that, go to  <a href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp</a>  and click on your state.  You will then be taken to your state’s page, where you can click on “Legal Analysis.”  All the information you need will be spelled out for you there.<br>  <br>  As for convincing your parents to allow you to homeschool, your best bet is to focus on the academics.  State calmly that you take your education very seriously and that you are acutely concerned about your grades slipping.  Explain further that the high school atmosphere, with all the drama and distractions, is one you have found to be detrimental to your academic performance, and most importantly, to true learning.  Stress that you *want* to do well and to succeed, and that you are willing to take responsibility for your high school education in order to make such success possible.  Have ready to show them various online high school curricula (do your research first) that interest you (and *show* them how interested and motivated you are).  <br>  <br>  One of the potential hesitations your parents may have concerns your depression.  If you are clinically depressed, they may worry that you will become even more so at home, where they may fear you will be too “isolated.”  This may be a valid concern on their part.  Then again, it sounds like the high school environment *itself* was instrumental in bringing on your depression, in which case, you would do well to calmly remind your parents of that fact.<br>  <br>  If your parents are not familiar with homeschooling, they may be under the impression (fueled by irresponsible and uninformed media) that homeschooling is “bad.”  In an effort to reassure them otherwise, be sure to check out (and maybe print out portions of) the following sites:<br>  <a href="http://school.familyeducation.com/home-schooling/parenting/29861.html" rel="nofollow">http://school.familyeducation.com/home-s...</a><br>  <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/weblinks/whynot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/webl...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  In addition, and perhaps most importantly, try to get a hold of a copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education, by Grace Llewellyn.  It should be in your local library.  It’s also on Amazon.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation...</a>  <br>  This book will prove to be invaluable to you, not only in making your own decision to pursue homeschooling, but also in convincing your parents.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the very best of luck.

People FREAK when girls are preyed on by male teachers, but it's COOL when boys get the hot teacher's attention. I'm not saying you want the attention, I'm just saying that here because it's ridiculous thinking.<br>  <br>  Tell someone. Even though she does arouse you. There have been so many teenage boys who have been sexual with their teachers thinking it was going to be awesome and are now regretting it.<br>  <br>  Report her. That's disgusting.|`|R1scPRfVaa	Uh... You need to tell somebody!<br>  Think of what would happen if she was a little kindergarten teacher or something... She should be shot.|`|wInLe57taa	I cannot tell if this is a joke or not, but if you are being serious you need to inform someone about this right away before the situation gets worse! Tell your parents, guidance counselor, principal, or any adult you feel comfortable telling.|`|6876dcaf52063a0714c9fa8522300dddaa	I think you should just tell the principal what happened and your parents as well. You don't need to tell your friends unless you want to and for an adult to do that to you, she can get in trouble.|`|OZwAMF6Faa	what she is doing is WRONG!!<br>  contact the police or your school principal and tell them what is going on, also your parents!!<br>  you won't get into any trouble as long as you tell the truth!<br>  you can't let her keep doing this|`|LejyqXaAaa	Tell the principle your getting harrased

4vLt3SqFaa	I am not sure what you mean - without classes as in subjects like math or english and you want Unit Studies - or - without having to sign on a specific times to participate in specific classes?<br>  <br>  Last I knew no cyber school does unit study programs<br>  <br>  Check out connections academy:  They had flexibility when my son used them.  You could go online anytime and access class instruction or look at a CD or DVD.  This may have changed - it has been some years ago when they first started.<br>  <br>  They are also free - paid for by the local school district, much to their unhappiness I might add because it is not cheap for them but free for you.  Available everywhere in PA and state approved plus no home school paperwork, and they supply the computer.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what else there is.  I know of a couple of private ones but I have not been impressed by them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.connectionsacademy.com/ourschool/" rel="nofollow">http://www.connectionsacademy.com/oursch...</a>
DwUeG9qwaa	If he does, just apologise.  In copying your friends homework, you should have really been aware that you could get caught, and could get a detention.  You need to pay for your actions.|`|MuALb7lxaa	Well, the second offense is pretty bad. I had the same situation as you on Thursday. I let one of my friends copy my English homework, and the teacher saw my friend copying the work down and she asked "Whose work are you copying" and she came over and asked me if I knew he had it and I said "Yes" and she said "Well, I can't give either of you credit because that's cheating". So, me and him got a 0 on the assignment and I wasn't allowed to re-do it. So, when I got the paper back today it had a big fat 0 on it and said "CHEATING". I hate her. I would, if your teacher asks you is I would just fess up and say "It will never happen ever again", but it might be harder for him to believe that since it's the second time. He might give you a detention or 2, and maybe an extra assignment and maybe a 0 on the current assignment you cheated from. There is nothing I can say is just don't do it again.|`|k5X78IM3aa	I am a teacher.  What may I ask is wrong with you doing your homework & your friend doing his homework?  I am guessing that neither of you like to do homework...right?  Maybe the two of you could do your homework together & not copy but just discuss the work & then both of you write it in your own words.  That should take some of the pain out of it.<br>  <br>  I don't know about detention policies in your school.  But I do know that if you go by school policies, you won't get detention.  Copying homework is not a school policy as you know as well as I do.  Also, your teacher is not "out to get you" unless you give him a reason to...& even than he his not out to get you.  Teachers too have policies <br>  they must go by, and one of them is to see that students bear the consequences of their actions.  You cheat, you get detention (maybe...again I don't know your school policies).  <br>  <br>  I actually loved working with students & wanted them all to do their  very best.  And I want the best for you.  Try talking to your teacher about anything that bothers you & perhaps school will go smoother.  Teachers are your friend...believe it or not.  Good luck.|`|QSF6FF2Yaa	oh well do your homework<br>  detentions arnt the end of the world<br>  i used to get like 4 a week. <br>  <br>  and i never did homework and have 12 gcses.|`|inCByaonaa	Don't worry, most teens copy homework. At least ure kinda doin it. I never bothered doing it n i got on ok. Chillax u cud b doin far worse. x|`|pz09LoOyaa	Get over it.  <br>  There are more important issues than that.<br>  <br>  A detention is a detention..wow?|`|N1UOHz58aa	I don't get took all books and homework?<br>  But anyways which every way he caught u, u still cheated in a certain way. By doing what you did ur were of course cheating off ur friend. But letting ur friend cheat off of you is also cheating no matter how weird it sounds.So I think your teacher is right on this one  sorry. But cheating will not help you out in the long run when your taking a test and u have no clue what to do.  You should be lucky he's letting u redo it and give u credit for it. My teacher would of made me redo it for no credit and also get a half day In school detention. So no matter how weird and how wrong or bad you think this is but your teachers giving you a favor by teaching you not to cheat and also letting you redo it so u know how to do it. If u get dentition u get detion there's nothing u can do about that. So if you do sit through it and it will be over as soon as u know it maybe not when your waiting but when its over. He will probably not or he would of probably told you when he told you to redo it. Your teacher probably does not have a hunch on you. he just trying to teach you lesson that will help you succeed in life which is his job to do. Of course sometimes your going to copy a few answers of someones eles you didnt have time to do or you ddint know how to. About everybody ahs done that. but don't get in the habit of doing it because it will come back and bit you in the but.

38FQ3YfFaa	Okay, let's solve for s first.<br>  <br>  s + 4t = -4<br>  s = -4t - 4<br>  <br>  Then put that in your other equation and solve for t.<br>  <br>  3s + 5t = 2<br>  3(-4t - 4) + 5t = 2<br>  -12t - 12 + 5t = 2<br>  -12t + 5t = 14<br>  -7t = 14<br>  t = -2<br>  <br>  Yay! So far so good.<br>  <br>  Now let's solve for t in the first equation.<br>  <br>  s + 4t = -4<br>  4t = -s - 4<br>  t = (-s - 4)/4<br>  t = -1/4s - 1<br>  <br>  Then put it in the second to solve for s.<br>  <br>  3s + 5t = 2<br>  3s + 5(-1/4s -1) = 2<br>  3s + -5/4s -5 = 2<br>  12/4s - 5/4s = 7<br>  7/4s = 7<br>  s = 7/(7/4)<br>  s = (7/1)(4/7)<br>  s = 4<br>  <br>  So we got (4, -2). Remember to use the simpler equation first. It makes it a lot easier. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and happy equating! :)|`|WJjsUpaDaa	3s+5t=2<br>  s+4t=-4  | * (-3) here you got a system of equations<br>  <br>   3s+5t=2<br>  -3s-12t=12  now you add these equations<br>  <br>  0s -7t= 14<br>  t=-2<br>  <br>  3s-10=2<br>  3s=12<br>  s=4<br>  <br>  you got the right answer:) <br>  <br>  <br>  but i think the first equation must be like 3s+5t=-2

My bf owns a company so i also know that they will contact your employer and garnish wages if you try to hide your money in a shoe box. call CCCS and see if you can get an appointment with them it's free advice it can't hurt.

pD2MtL9Oaa	If 40 washers weigh 500 grams and 20 washers weigh 420 grams, then there is a difference of 80 grams.  So, the 20 washers that were taken out must weigh 80 gram.    If 20 washers weigh 80 grams, and you have a pail with 20 washers in it that weighs 420 grams, the pail's weight (p) = 420 - 80 = 340 grams.    The winner would ideally get three twenty dollar bills (the largest denomination) and then two tens and two fives.  This could be done by drawing the bills as follows:  20, 10, 5, 20, 10, 5, 20    This would give you $100 as the maximum prize.    Fill the 4 gallon bucket and pour it's contents into the 7 gallon bucket.  Refill the 4 gallon and pour as much as you can into the seven.  Now you have 1 gallon left in the 4 gallon bucket.  Empty the 7 gallon bucket.  Pour the 1 gallon from the 4 gallon bucket into the 7 gallon bucket.  Now refill the 4 gallon bucket and pour it into the 7 gallon bucket, giving you a total of 5 gallons in that bucket.    Since we can't see the tracks, we can't answer your last question.|`|juqGUHIcaa	The first one is a system of equations, using the variables 'p' for the pail's weight and 'w' for the washers' weight:  500 = p + 40w  420 = p + 20w    If we set both of these equations equal to p, we can have a nice substitution set up:  p = 500 - 40w  p = 420 - 20w    Set them equal to each other and solve:  500 - 40w = 420 - 20w  80 = 20w  w = 4    Once we have that the washer's weight is 4 grams, plug that into either one of our initial equations:  p = 420 - 20(w) = 340  p = 500 - 40(w) = 340    Pail weighs 340g    --------------------------------------...  As a person draws bills, obviously three 20's will be what we want to go out on. In the meantime before getting the third 20, we want as much money as possible WITHOUT going out. Logically, this is two tens and two fives. I can't tell by your questions, but maybe it's 10 tens or 10 ones. If it's ones, just compensate that in the logic.  So at the end, we will have three 20's, two 10's and two 5's, or $100.    --------------------------------------...  I don't know the third answer and the fourth is an incomplete question.
yGOmMQP7aa	If he still has not done his taxes, I'm not exactly sure what you are going back and "correcting"???    You need to encourage your father to do his taxes early because no school will give you a financial aid "award letter" or package your money for school with estimated information.      Also, I would discourage you from doing too many "corrections" to your fafsa.  This increases your chances of being selected for verification, which is even more delays... You are already having to wait on a slow polk dad who is waiting til the last minute to get his taxes done!!      Applying for financial aid is a PROCESS, that takes weeks... sometimes months!  Good luck.|`|I5wje0J1aa	It's better that you guess.|`|ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	Yes, leave everything at the estimated value.  I do not know what corrections should be made. If your info was processed for 90-10 then let it go until the taxes are filed.

While I don't mind helping someone who is having trouble with homework, I refuse to help someone who is simply too lazy to pick up a book and open it to the proper page and copy the answers down.    What in the world are today's kids going to do when they get in the work force and have to think and do for themselves?  I sure as heck don't want a president who has to to turn to Yahoo Answers to get his job done!
AA12367014	Barack and Michelle Obama as well as Joe Biden and his wife have taught higher education. You could analyze how this will effect their governing style.
mhFpZT3laa	Have you been accepted at both? Congrats. If you are considering which you want to go to at some later point, I'm afraid that you usually don't have that much choice in the matter! Georgetown is slightly higher ranked, but neither is going to really make you better than you work to be. Residency is by FAR more important for learning the clinical part of medicine. Go to the school that you feel better at, or that has a teaching style you like. It'll get you better scores and, thus, more chance to choose your top primary care residency.

xjc1u12naa	Well, you may want to have a thesis statement (what you intend to prove) as the finishing sentence for your intro.     One of my favorite ways to start an essay is with an anecdote, or a short story. So if you are doing Romeo and Juliet, and why you feel sorry for them, you might want to use a modern example (changing names of course) of how the play begins. Ex, "Let's pretend you have a friend named Janet." Go on like that, and have Janet in a similar situation to Juliet. Then you can ask "Wouldn't you feel sorry for your friend if this situation was true? I would. So why should I not also feel sorry for Romeo and Juliet who find themselves in a similar predicament."  (I hope that makes sense!)|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Well you could start with the fact that under modern law Romeo would be regarded as a paedophile. Juliet was "almost fourteen". Romantic tragedies with thirteen year old girls would not go down very well nowadays.
