She is constantly fighting with her boyfriend, the father of the baby. <br>  Every day, she gets up a few times each night to a screaming baby who needs to be fed or changed. <br>  She used to have goals of going to college and being a teacher. That will probably never happen now, she has no money.<br>  She doesn't even have a driver's license, as she doesn't have time to drive and go to driving school, or the money for it. <br>  She can't afford to pay her phone bill.<br>  Her parents have a two bedroom apt, and she is living in their living room, so she doesn't even have a room to call her own. <br>  The father of the baby gets to go out and have fun; she is stuck at home.<br>  She doesn't have a job, probably won't be able to get one.<br>  She has all the baby weight and sees her friends who have nice figures, and feel jealous. <br>  She is 18, 3 years older than you. <br>  Looking at her after she has slept for only 2 hours in 3 days is hard. She is miserable.<br>  <br>  There are no weekends. There are no vacations. Money isn't just magically going to appear and school isn't magically going to be finished.<br>  <br>  Please take my advice and don't do anything stupid. It's not all fun and games like playing with a doll. It is fine to want children someday, but at 15, you should be thinking about having fun with your friends, finishing highschool, going to college, living your life. And you can't do that with a baby.|`|J04vc7L8aa	You seem to have thought this out. Id personally say its your "maternal instincts" kicking in as i presume youre going through puberty.

You have to be able to financially support it and yourself. You need to be educated to be able to make wise decisions for both of your futures, you have PLENTY of time to have children, when you are old enough to work, go to a daycare, be around children, graduate high school, get at least an associates degree, in this changing world you will need it, then have a child. You cannot rely on other people or taxpayers to provide, shelter food and money for you and a baby.|`|AA12177872	It's not weird at all. There have been times where I have wanted one too but then I realized after awhile that they are not always easy to take care of on your own. Yeah at first it seems like oh this is easy and if I could do it before than the next time I have another baby to take care of it should be even easier, butthat's's not always so. All babies differ in the way their behavior is. Anyways I believe you are just too young for one right now besides like you said you don't have a job and you are still in school I assume and right now I just don't believe is a good time for you to take that kind of responsibility I mean you have all the time in the world to have a child of your own (Lord's Will) and if you love taking care of kids that much then maybe you should consider taking a job in Day Care. Check out some local daycares in your area and see if they are hiring. I believe that would be better than having a baby of your own right now. It will be a whole lot easier and besides one day you might change your mind and fall in love with someone and then eventually marry him and then you two can have kids together. It's all your decision though I'm not trying to make it for you. Hope this helps. Love Coolgirl1376.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Your brief experience at mothering showed you how wonderful it is to be needed and how loving a baby can be.  It didn't show you all the other things motherhood entails.  Now that you have had the experience with a baby, try taking care of children of all ages 24/7.  Spend the weekend with a 6 year old; and then a 11 year old and then a teenager.  Try figuring out a budget where you can pay bills and still have money to do all the fun things.  Think about hard decisions parents have to make every day (like braces or if your child should become deathly ill).  There is a lot more to parenting than just taking care of a baby through the night. "Johnny hit me"; "Why do the kids call me fat?" "Can I smoke weed, mom".|`|Gem96NQyaa	I would debate anyone who says having a baby is 100% going to "ruin your life".  There are always exceptions to the rule and there are always exceptional young parents out there.<br>  <br>  That said, a word of advice... taking care of a baby is a whole lot different from actually raising one.  You've taken care of a newborn for 3-4 months... having a baby of your own means you'll be taking care of your child for the next 18 years, minimum.<br>  <br>  That means not only the newborn stuff you say is "not hard"... you'll also be dealing with the terrible twos, teething, illnesses, not to mention the actual pregnancy and birth itself (which is physically draining on an adult body, let alone a child's body).<br>  <br>  Then there's the financial side of things... on average, it takes a minimum of $500,000 to raise one child from birth to the age that they're legally and adult and that's not taking things like serious illness/injury, college, and day care/general fun stuff people do with their kids into account.<br>  <br>  It sounds a bit to me like you simply want to fill a void in your life... I would think long and hard about what that void really is before you do something that you'll have a very hard time undoing.|`|tWvM6M0raa	do not have a child at 15<br>  its far to young and you will regret it<br>  its just something your going through<br>  <br>  when i was 15 i wanted a baby as well, i had done for a while<br>  i'm 18 now and i no if i would have had a baby when i was 15 it would have ruined my life.<br>  <br>  just have fun being a teenager, if you had a baby you would have to look after it all the time and you wouldn't be able to have fun with friends.<br>  <br>  It is not the same looking after someone else's child as your own.<br>  <br>  wait a few years and if its still what you want go for it.

Also Points can be lost via receiving Violations.<br>  NOTE: Points are not lost for inactivity on the site.<br>  <br>  Always try to post more answers than you ask questions, as this will hinder your progress from gaining the levels, and will cause demotions to lower levels, like you have experienced.<br>  <br>  For more information regarding the Points & Levels system please visit here: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtO2jOwHKD26SIyvtqkTTDsF.Bd.;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|F0h2iFWsaa	If your point level dropped below 250 (the level 2 minimum), your level reverted to level one.

AA11408911	Your Yahoo! Answers best answer percentage is simply math (maths), and is a representation of the number of best answers you have achieved in comparison to the total number of answers you have provided to the Yahoo! Answers community. <br>  <br>  For example, let's say you have answered one hundred questions and earned twenty best answers. This would give you a best answer percentage of 20%. <br>  <br>  Now, let's say you answer another one hundred questions but fail to earn any more best answers. That twenty best answers our of the new total of two hundred would decrease your best answer percentage to 10%. Your best answer percent shall decrease if you answer more questions yet earn less best answers. If you want the percentage to increase, you need to earn more best answers in comparison to standard (non-best) answers. <br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Something that is not indicated by the figures in your profile, is the fact that your percentage of best answers pertains not to the current total of answers, but to the number of resolved answers. Let's say at a given point you have a 10% best answer score. On that day you answer 10 more questions. On the same day, this percentage remains the same. Assuming you get no best answer from these 10 questions, the percentage will go down as those questions get resolved.<br>  So what happened is last time you came you had a given percentage, but in the time you didn't show, you must have had a lot of resolved questions without getting best answer and your percentage against resolved answer went down.|`|UKENIXvuaa	The percentage is a ratio of best answers over all your submitted answers.<br>  <br>  % =  best answers/all answers x 100%<br>  <br>  You have no control over it.  Either the asker or the voters choose which one is the best answer.|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You have got about 160 answers either "Open" or in "Voting". You may have had 16% best answer when you had answered 160 questions but you have doubled the amount of questions you have asked and have not yet had any best answers to those questions.<br>  With the extra day now allowed for voting, it is taking longer for the resolved questions to level up to the number of questions asked. <br>  As voting periods expire and hopefully you accumulate some best answers you will see your BA percentage start to move upward again.

If your answer is chosen as the best answer by the asker or voters, you gain 10 points, and you can even vote for your own answer. If you choose a best answer for your question, you gain 3 points. If you ask a question, you lose 5 points. My advice is limit the amount of questions you ask to 1 per day until you reach level 2, answer as many questions as Yahoo allows you to per day, and always vote for your answers as best in open questions. Actually, if you follow the Yahoo points scale when you ask a question, you'll get to keep your 5 points that you lost. After you ask a question, select a best answer for your question to earn 3 points back, then answer a question to earn 2 points back, and you'll lose no points and you'll have your 5 points back. When you boost levels, you can give people's answers a thumbs up and rate people's answers. It's not that much of a benefit.

The more people who know about the question, the more answers...<br>  <br>  Secondly, any question that is starred is automatically eligible to be selected at random to be placed on the popular list on the Yahoo! Answers homepage. Very popular questions may be reviewed and featured on the homepage scroll bar.<br>  <br>  Lastly, stars help you to determine who your fans are, allowing you to select contacts that may share common interests with you.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs

When you don't mark them as contacts they can kinda get lost in the big, bad world of Y!A.  When you want to email them you can through the email on the profile.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	The signs your 'friend' is showing can mean she has some problems at home, not that she is 'crazy'. Many people are quick to write off things like this to 'oh, she's just pms or bipolar or whatever', but they are often a sign of much worse things. It can be clinical depression, it can be abuse of some kind happening at home, etc.<br>  <br>  Rather than being upset with her, you might want to see if you can get her to talk about what is happening and why, or help her get to some type of counseling that might be able to help her.|`|ce610883b4ac82c9a4aba8fa2bd1ebdeaa	Do you know for sure that something is bothering her?  In regard to how she talks on the phone, a lot of people are like that, for one thing.  Or perhaps she just didn't feel like talking.  Did she still seem melancholy to you when you got to her house?  If there is something bothering her, perhaps she's just going through a rough time and she doesn't want to talk about it.  It's possible that her home life isn't good (i.e.: an unhealthy environment within her home, abuse), and it's very possible she is clinically depressed.  Is there anything that happened to her that you know about that may have affected her emotionally?<br>  <br>  Also, it seems to me that you aren't as good of a friend as you think you are--if you were a good friend, you wouldn't be proclaiming yourself so high and mighty and then say "I'm sick of trying to help my friend feel better."  You seem pretty insensitive to your friend.  I mean, really--"she always sounds depressed or someone has murdered her family or something." ?!?? That's not exactly the most polite thing to say about someone.  Perhaps you should evaluate how much of a friend you are, and not how "little" of a friend she is.
CENwFQr1aa	You cannot do this with yahoo. However there is a facility in gmail through which you can get a copy of each incoming email of gmail account to the yahoo account.

However there is no option in yahoo through which each incoming yahoo email is sent to gmail account as well. you'll have to manually forward each mail to gmail account.

lZnuQ6cQaa	Yes you are complaining. <br>  <br>  And no, the points system in place here is not a bad thing. Whether or not the points system provides any benefit outside of Yahoo, the point is that a lot of people are prompted to give both useful and pointless answers to questions that people ask.<br>  <br>  This is the internet. Just like you, everyone else is free to present their opinion. If they think your question is dumb, then they should be free to say so. If you think they've crossed over from criticism to abuse, then feel free to report them.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, don't whine. Your "question", which was actually just a rant, is doing more to degrade Yahoo! Answers than a thousand pointless answers.|`|AA10520442	I don't know that anyone is really here for the points.  I think alot of people come here just to be dumb ( because they can ) and because they are bored.  They don't take it seriously and that is their own decision.  Just as in real life, there are the good apples at the top of the tree and the rotten ones on the ground.  We notice the rotten ones because they are down at eye level stinking up the place and attracting flies when, in fact, it's the good apples at the top we need to focus on. It might take a little more effort to find the good apples but they are worth the effort. <br>  <br>  Be blessed and be a blessing  :)|`|AA11387869	I wholeheartedly agree.  <br>  -People don't even come back and select their own best answers to their questions.<br>  -People 'report' others, simply because they don't agree with them<br>  -People say, "thanks for the 2 points,' or "I don't know"<br>  -People answer rudely, then sometimes follow-up with a ruder email.<br>  <br>  It's really a shame that these bad apples can spoil it for the rest of us.|`|AA10180434	I agree with you. my point is very low, but if I dont no the answer, I dont reply.<br>  thanks for your information. <br>  cheers.|`|coQBIFVvaa	Thanks for the 2 points.<br>  <br>  No, seriously, it upsets me too.  Especially when somebody parrots my response and then gets the 10 point bonus.<br>  <br>  I thought that if you had enough points you could trade them in for a boat or a machine gun or something.<br>  <br>  I don't know.

BKjnDG99aa	invited members by-pass the pending approval. the idea is you invited them, meaning you wanted them as members verses someone just scrolling upon your group that you didn't invite.<br>  the only peding you'll get is those who join w/o a invite<br>  those invited members. if they join, will apear in your members list|`|ZnNY6Rctaa	Unless the group specifies new members need approval they could join without showing in the pending folder.|`|YLMVljoraa	Pending members are those who have responded to an invitation or have gone to your group and requested membership.  If the group's policy is to require approval they will show as 'pending' until they are approved.  A list of invitations can be found under 'group activity-memberships' in the the managment area of the group.

hSNni3mSaa	You're just as screwed as I am. Yahoo has done away with personalized launchcast stations. Like you, I have thousands of ratings and enjoyed music I loved whenever I could log onto a computer that allowed the script. I found out last night, by chance, that launchcast is no more. They are forcing us to move onto Rapsody (not CBS as they claim), which allows 14 days of free listening (after you "register") then it will cost $14.99 per month. I am very unhappy about this development and have been venting my frustration on yahoo buzz, as well as customer feedback.|`|kvO8E8p4aa	<a href="http://boulter.com/blog/2009/02/06/how-to-download-your-launchcast-ratings/" rel="nofollow">http://boulter.com/blog/2009/02/06/how-t...</a>

AA11960743	Looks like your rule works.<br>  <br>  Since the starred questions are for the benefit of others, having Questions that are still open for Answers or at least Voting right at the top of the list, where they are more likely to be seen, is supposed to be a good thing. <br>  <br>  Since Watchlist Questions are for your own consumption - it makes more sense to order them in the same sequence you found them, so that the most recent is the most accessible.<br>  <br>  I am curious to find out what the exceptions are and why.

Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer.

6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There are two ways. You can mark an item as spam but that moves it to the spam folder only one time and notifies Yahoo. Yahoo does not permanently block spam unless they receive many notifications and it is possible.<br>  <br>  The second way is to add the address to the blocked address list in mail options > spam options. This only works if the address is constant. The mail is deleted before receipt and you never see it, not even in the trash.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	It is not eBay that you have to worry about. You do not buy from them. They host many stores and individuals. They are the ones that you have to deal with. I would trust one of the stores over an individual. The big problem is that you must trust each other. One person is sending an item and the other is paying for it. Who should go first?<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

You may have gotten a phishing mail which looks exactly like a letter from your bank. Under any circumstances, never click any link in such email messages. Call your bank directly and clarify anything.<br>   If you are in doubt, ask whether they sent you an email concerning this. Keep your account safe!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps..|`|ewjDFcAPaa	I'm not a Banker, but it takes some time for the actual money to be deposited.  It's one thing to say it's there.  It's another to actually have one bank physically receive money to back up what is said it is getting. <br>  <br>  Generally what happens when you cash a check ,and get money in return, is that thet bank is giving you money out of your current account based on what is actually there.
