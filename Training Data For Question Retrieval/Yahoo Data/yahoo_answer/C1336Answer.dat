QVBi1LxHaa	Me- I attempt to make light of a trying situation through humor.  Advantages: It makes me feel better temporarily.  Disadvantages: I'm really not that funny and have rather poor timing, only making the situation worse at times.    A friend of mine- Becomes easily angered when they do not have control over the situation.  Advantages: They feel because they choose to become angry instead of upset they are able to control the situation again.  Disadvantages: In all reality, they loose more control of the situation because the anger eventually consumes them.    A classmate- Eats when things don't go her way.  Advantage: To be honest, I can not think of one.  Disadvantage: She is becoming really rather overweight.|`|7ff9f79baa66c040a4776c9c5d34f59aaa	i dont know if this is considered a defense mechanism, but whenever someone insults me or hurts my feelings, i start to hum or whistle to myself. i dunno i think its to distract myself or something.|`|THLq9SKbaa	following   advice "Nothing can destroy my joy of life and my good mood if safe and money enough"|`|mnskuUdzaa	I've got a whole podcast episode devoted to defense mechanisms and during the podcast I mention a whole bunch of specific everyday examples.

D'abord, les somnifres sont fournis sur prescription mdicale, donc avec un minimum de contr?le, ce qui n'est pas le cas du cannabis.  ensuite, il faut savoir de quel cannabis on parle. Quand c'est celui qu'on plante de fa?on artisanal, le danger est assez faible car la concentration de THC, l'agent actif du cannabis est faible. Mais le cannabis produit "industriellement" a une concentration en THC extrmement forte.  C'est pourquoi aussi on ne peut comparer les annes 70 o les mthodes de production taient assez peu rationnalises  (et donc le THC peu concentr) avec ce qu'on trouve aujourd'hui.

za9b8cHKaa	I think the quote is entirely truthful. If we do it, we're whores, if we don't we're prudes.|`|5hqKYXRwaa	there is nothing wrong with sex at all. age doesnt matter either.  unless its rape.|`|iX3gdMOcaa	Whats a virgin ? |`|AA11900069	True.  A guy who racks up a tally is lauded by other -MOST- other guys, (not me I should hasten to add, I view sex outside of a relationship as an empty, worthless endeavour) and yet there never seems to be a shortage of women, quite aware of his habit, to satisfy him for another night/week/month.  A woman who keeps herself to herself, is damned as a prude, yet if she is adventurous and "popular", she walks into the "slut" label, which both men and women seem happy to hang on her.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Judgement of a woman's sexual behaviour in the main is done by other women. Rumours are spread about women by women.    Lyanthya, even in Muslim countries it is the matriarchs that the girls have to impress, if a woman's reputation is going to be destroyed by gossip, it will generally be done by other woman. We all know that.|`|5fiGDZJpaa	Seems true enough, yet women's liberation was women being able to decide for themselves, work for themselves, etc. The fact that some women fold under social pressures.... be it sex or shoe styles.... is a failure of women to use their liberation. In their defense on this point, men are no better. We are social animals, vulnerable to peer pressure and obsessed with outward appearance.     I think its telling that many who chose virginity feel they must make it a public statement, as if in some quest for approval. So it seems that even if a woman makes a choice, some feel they must still satisfy the need to be accepted. Freedom and Social Acceptance generally conflict with each other. |`|TfAxeV3Maa	both "slut" and "prude" are rather obsolete in educated or progressive circles   Lyantha..if you want to base your worth as a woman by an intact hymen..okay better you than me  but I think you may regret it one day..if you wait until marriage and get divorced, or if something happens and you have sex before you planned you will unwarrantably feel worthless and shameful..but I'll stop because I know you are wanting people to disapprove of your virginity and I'm feeding that|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Lets face it, women lost the sexual revolution, and their children are part of the collateral damage. If having the right to degrade yourself is a sign of progress, then I'll stick with tradition. Few women will admit that the majority of female problems today are self induced. Issues created and propagated by other females. Lets be honest, women place higher expectations on themselves than what men place on them.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I think all quotes that try to label women in derogatory ways based on their sexual behaviour originate from closed-minded and repressed individuals.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	I think that here in the aftermath of the sexual revolution, 40 years after the pill came into use, no one thinks much in terms of sluts and prudes except teenagers.  There may be some truth to the quote, since it resonated with some who answered above, but I think it may be rather limited truth.|`|e52ejkQ7aa	I really don't think you can win if you're a woman. If you put out too much, you're a slut, and if you don't put out enough you're a prude. The Madonna/Whore complex.     |`|srIMFTb8aa	There's definitely some truth to that.    Eoghan, in my personal experience, the vast majority of the people who called me either a "prude" or a "slut" (yes, I was called both) were men.|`|WKtakdsOaa	I have never been called a prude or a slut. I couldnt care less if every woman stayed a virgin more fit men for me lol|`|wzqahEqiaa	I'm in my mid 20's and currently single.  I practice chastity and I plan on giving my virginity to my husband if I ever marry.  Chastity is a foreign thing in the United States.  Watch the videos below on YouTube about chastity if you want to learn more.    I want to save my virginity mainly out of respect for God.  I am also concerned about getting sexually transmitted diseases.  Some STD's do damage that can make it impossible to have children.    I don't tell everyone I meet that I am a virgin.  I will talk about chastity if asked about my personal life.  I don't think that I'm a prude for respecting my body and saving sex for marriage.  Overcoming temptations is very challenging at times.    Chastity has helped me become more confident and I will not compromise my standards.  I am not embarrassed to talk about sex with anyone.  I feel more liberated as a woman knowing how to relate to people in a nonsexual way.    It seems that a lot of people with low standards assume that everyone has the same viewpoint.  From my experience most women that base everything on sex or their appearance get very jealous if they see other women get attention in a nonsexual way.  Life can be interesting...

u7vrul2Faa	Yes I totally agree, you go out happily for a ride or a drive and there always seems to be some idiot who wants to annoy you or run you off the road. I used to be a calm driver but now I get highly stressed out by these people and retaliate when they have the cheek to beep me when they are in the wrong. I could never ride a bike it is even worse than the car. So risky with so many idiot car drivers about.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Thats  scary and very dangerous. if you can next time get a license plate number and call the cops. sounds to me people are harrassing you. or hoping no-1 is out to get you.. ---Becareful  and keep your head up .|`|AA11900069	You have the right to get damn angry when a careless fool nearly kills you.  I sure do.    Hope they give you a break.    |`|pvykmTD2aa	I might sound a bit biased but I fear bikers. They seem to think they own the road and can cut you off and pass on the outside just cos they feel like it.  I find it nerve wracking to have a  biker either behind or in front of me cos you never know what they are gonna do next.|`|PJgKioNjaa	So vent,bro. Let it out. I got used to being chopped off and cut up years ago,due to driving a big-rig at work,and a big Yam at home. It's a fact that if you get a rowdy going with the 1st tosser to cut you up,you'll be fired all day,because in 1/2 a mile from now some pr1ck's gonna do it again. I just let it happen,these days,coz bro,i just ain't got the energy to kill 70 plebs a day. I have a theory that it's because no-one,regardless of what they're driving,actually LIKES driving,no matter how much they cream-up over their all singing all dancing plebmobile,with electric twatometer and see-through windscreens. Give any of the "I paid 80'000 for it as it's top of the range" box owners a chance to swap it for an instant kinetic-transfer system,and they'd bite your hand off-which proves it ain't the driving,it's the arriving,that counts.So the average pleb in their 6-cd-changing,air-conditioned computer controlled micro-universe isn't thinking of what they're doing NOW,but what they INTEND doing when they GET there. To sum up-cars are for gutless plebs who are scared to ride! Cos bikes are about the RIDING,not the arriving!|`|vSv54sAkaa	Yes I can relate.    I have noticed that my patience got better with age and practise.    If you get mad then stop off at the nearest safe stopping point, and take a walk to vent off your anger not behind the wheel.    I found relaxing music helped too.    Remind yourself that they have a psychological problem, and if anything try and feel sorry for them... this seems to help me.    I also started driving at quieter times... not sure if that's possible for you.    Or take public transport as it is far less stressful in regard to road rage, and you could listen to music via iPod or whatever, or read so it's great for saving time, as you can do stuff while you're travelling.  |`|zpO1kKKRaa	No I cannot relate to your biker issues.     You probably should get a car rather than fending off for yourself all the time with a bike at a low steady speed. You might actually get pushed aside and fall to the gravel, so its a 50-50 situation of ending up in a hospital bed |`|RZMBz3Ivaa	you cant control the actions of other drivers, no matter how jerkish theyre being, dont let it stress you because you are more likely to become a hazard yourself if youre driving annoyed.    no point in getting stressed, i set off 10 minutes early everytime i go somewhere incase of slow drivers, jams, traffic lights etc,      x
AA11298562	Part of it is a defense mechanism, as you say.  They may be embarassed or insecure about their feelings and end up going overboard to 'prove' they don't have them.  Another part of it is control.  Some people's response to critisism is to try to make the critisiser like them.  This plays right into the bully's hands.  If they can, through critisism, make their target feel insecure, make them doubt their friendships, make them work for the bully's approval, then the bully has control over them.  This is how many abusive relationships get their start.  A third part may be simply that the bully feels insecure themselves, and by putting others down, they can make themselves feel they're better than someone else.|`|SCOHT6L6aa	i thought thats what imature ppl in elementary school do.  I have never witnessed a grown man do this sort of thing |`|VdLuqgiGaa	Sometimes people tease when they are trying to flirt, but bullying is more like a form of verbal abuse. It's about control & domination.|`|F3NNKwP9aa	If someone is bullying you they don't like you! There is no bullying if you honestly like someone. |`|GqQb2wlcaa	some people are attracted to someone and then start behaving like (for example) their parents behaved when they were growing up. Unwittingly they are pushing that person away because they repeat patterns from the past.
AA11527203	I have to say with or without the 700 bill, the dollars will fare worse comparing to any currency as is happening right now.  In medium term, dollar will fare worse than any other currencies in the world (except for a few *** up one). That is because US economy is busted with basic of capitalism; i.e. property.   In longer term, if the US administration, Fed, and unavoidable President can come up with rescue package, econ stimulating policies, US dollar will then and only then improve.|`|AA11900069	A very good question!

Lametones, my Lady|`|333f99a7d47ffacf6ba5a798e336dd76aa	Sexo Tntrico  El sexo tntrico se enmarca en en el contexto del Tantra, proveniente de la antigua India y el Tibet. El sexo tntrico era originalmente una prctica abierta a todos, sin distincin de castas que permita acceder a la trascendencia. Dentro de las premisas fundamentales sexo tntrico, estaba el respeto incondicional por todos y la libertad por igual para todos los seres humanos. El tantrismo del dios Shiva ha sido objeto de persecuciones por diversos invasores de este pas: los arios, el Islam en la Edad Media y los ingleses puritanos de la colonizacin.    ...En el shivasmo la mujer encarna el poder, y el hombre la capacidad de maravillarse. Numerosos maestros eran y son todava mujeres. Ciertos legados slo se trasmiten a mujeres, y la mujer, cuando es discpula, disfruta de un prestigio mayor que el hombre, desde el punto de vista de la energa, del valor y de la intensidad de su visin. Los textos lo expresan con claridad: ?Aquello que un tantrika logra en un a?o, una discpula lo consigue en un da?, como si todo en ella echara races con naturalidad en el origen comn y olvidado de las religiones antiguas ms importantes.?    Curiosamente y contrario a la visin tradicional de los historiadores observamos cmo desde los celtas a los dravidianos del Valle del Indo, desde Egipto a Babilonia, los vestigios arqueolgicos develan la existencia de deidades femeninas.    ...El poder femenino, misterio que sigue vivo dentro del Tantra.  ?Aquello que un tantrika logra en un a?o, una discpula lo consigue en un da, como si todo en ella echara races con naturalidad en el origen comn y olvidado de las religiones antiguas ms importantes.?    En el sexo tntrico la integridad moral de la mujer no tiene mcula, concepcin muy distante de la que considera a sta como el origen del pecado, la tentacin y la condena, segn las tres religiones monotestas ms importantes; pero tambin algunas ramas del hinduismo y del budismo creen que la mujer es poderosa y va de transmisin de las ense?anzas msticas ms elevadas.    La concepcin del sexo tntrico no hace distincin entre lo puro y lo impuro, la belleza y la fealdad, el bien y el mal. Al igual que en la concepcin taosta de Yin-yang los opuestos se complementan para configurar el proceso de lo divino.    Afortunadamente, de la misma forma que en el sexo tntrico, se est comenzando a valorar la importancia de la mujer y la parte femenina que est dentro cada uno, fuente de riqueza y evolucin permanente, sin necesidad de competencia o guerra de los sexos.    Estos valores matrsticos (R. Eisler, M. Gimbutas) que estaban presentes en el tantrismo, constituyen patrones de relacin diferentes que tienden a la armona; la espontaneidad y sinceridad, la filiacin y la sinerga. Valores muy similares a los que identifican a las culturas matrsticas y son las que proclam Jess en sus ense?anzas.  En estas concepciones la divinidad est en el ser humano, no ms all de ste, y se manifiesta a travs de su modo de vivir.    Una mirada en armona con la tiempo que segua la lnea materna en el linaje igual que en la tradicin hebrea inicial.    De la misma forma en los manuales chinos de la antigedad la mujer es representada como guardiana de los arcanos sexuales y de la suprema fuente de la esencia y la energa vitales. La mujer desempe?a un papel de iniciadora y maestra de la sexualidad , considerndosela poseedora de las reservas de poder o te.     Para la investigadora Mery Jane Sherfey el perodo entre el 12.000 y el 8.000 A.C. marc una poca de libertad sexual pero, ste fluir cclico de sus impulsos sexuales, se fue haciendo cada vez ms inmanejable.|`|guNetoH2aa	Mira, Elo, ni tntrico ni leches fritas en vinagre de mdena... yo soy de la vieja escuela, y sigo pensando que hay cosas para las que EL CARA A CARA ES INSUSTITUIBLE.

SUERTE!!!|`|vbsWAk6naa	hola  pues mira si deberias ira un piscologo desde el punto de vista de una sociologa se puede deber a varios factores por los que dices ke aborreces el sexo.  1 se puede deber a factores socio-culturales, es decir, de la forma en como te educaron tus padres a lo mejor te dijeron eque el sexo era sucio o malo o pecado por lo ke por ello creas ke es sucio.  2 porke a lo mejor y digo a lo mejor reiteradamente no lo se solo estoy suponiendo TUVISTE UN ABUSO SEXUAL DE NI?A Y LO ENTERRASTE EN TU MENTE POR DOLOROSO QUE ERA  3 o por ultimo puede deberse a ke tu esposo solo tiene una mala manera de hacerlo buscando solo su propia satisfaccion y no la tuya.  En fin te recomiendo a ke vayas a terapia psicologica parqa ke sepan mas ke pueden hacer contigo ok y despues a un sexologo que es un terapeuta de pareja   NO TE DE PENA A VECES ESTAMOS MAS CUERDOS LOS KE RECONOCEMOS KE TENEMOS UN PROBLEMA Y VAMOS A SOLUCIONARLO CON ESPECIALISTASTAS.  no necesariamente estmos lokos.  ok  suerte|`|SpgD0WGIaa	A lo mejor no te gustan los hombres y ests casada y con hijos por pura inercia, porque todo el mundo lo hace y listo y no te planteaste nunca otra opcin ni nada.   Si no ests a gusto con una situacion debes intentar escapar de ella o mejorarla, de lo contrario te frustraras mucho ms.  Piensa en lo que quieres y despus tienes que trazar un plan de vida y ser feliz, no hacer todo lo que los dems quieran y sientan. T qu sientes?|`|VpSWq73Baa	Pues no es normal, tal vez es por tu marido y su forma de hacerlo jejeje. Tampoco es que te vayas a ir con otro, pero eso influye mucho y sobretodo si hace muchos a?os que tienes la misma pareja y no eres infiel, puede que la otra persona sin quererlo te haga aborrecer el sexo.  No es normal aborrecer algo que es natural.

I am nearly 19 and had therapy when I was younger however did not help me that much.  Some people will not understand the embarrassment we go threw but I do.  I had the same problem, I had a really bad stammer and got really nervous speaking in front of people, and I mean really really bad.  I felt my heart beating so fast it was as if it was jumping out of my chest, I though I was going to pass out.  I would also get bad headaches and sweat uncontrollably and would shake like you would not believe.  The first thing I will say from my experience is don't be afraid of stammering, it seems strange but I try ed to hide it my substituting words ETC.  The problem with that is you have to avoid words and everybody thinks you are a good speaker and so you don't want them to think otherwise and it gets worse and worse.  I found that with me I was ok with mates and family but around other people such as at college my nerves would kick in.  I finally plucked up the courage to go and see my doctor about it, it took me over 10 years to finally do it.  I went through school and some of college with this problem.  You would be amazed at how common it is, their are lots of drugs they can give you for your nerves, not the stutter but your nerves.  I was prescribed beta blockers to reduce my anxiety and my life has changed forever.  Don't be afraid to go, trust me it will be the bravest thing you ever do.  It seems though that it is more the stammering that you are struggling with with me it was more nerves but still some drugs make a dramatic difference.  Go and see your doctor mate its worth it.|`|bF3DAb1faa	i had /have a friend from high school whose brother stuttered,then he just somehow stopped,then my mate started with it.He used to see a speech therapist,and eventually he stopped almost completely.I knew him very well,and could look back now and guess that it was based on how he felt,not just nerves but mate 'X' used to stutter when really pleased and excited as well as nervy..    Here is a link,it's checks out as genuinely helpful without too much babble:  Beast of luck to you    http://www.stammering-stuttering.co.uk/    He's no where like that now,i guess it's more about what triggers it and if you plan on stopping it yourself,you need to be 100% sure that it's psychosomatic,and not neurological.  My old friends dad   used to stutter and did not stop and i'm thinking if it's part learned,and/or even genetic.    To stop it yourself,you will need to understand anxiety and how it affects all of us.  X got through this with something called the mitchell technique and relaxation tapes,and one session a week,speech therapy.for 1 month on/1 Month off took him a year.  Only residue of it is tiny amount of hesitation when tired and words are technical.|`|QKoWmn3maa	visit nsastutter.org and also stuttertalk.com    i stutter too! one of the best things to do if you have a stutter is to be comfortable with it.. my stutter is very mild.. it never happens with my parents and with some of my friends too it never happens.. but it does happen with a few strangers and some other not so friendly people! but when it does happen i am comfortable with it and not ashamed that i stutter.. come on its nothing i can control so why be embarrassed..? so the next time it happens tell them that 'i have a stutter.. its not a big deal.. i am comfortable with it.. and if you are going to be a jerk about it then just move on..' anyway best of luck!! but believe me, stuttering has its own advantages and its nothing to be ashamed of.. people who stutter are wonderful people!! :)    check this audio out too :  http://stuttertalk.com/2008/07/14/episod...  :)|`|iN4rksKgaa	OK no problem at all, I used to stutter to.

Ej490eFRaa	The dollar is worth a dollar.  First off, the value of the dollar constantly decreases over time.  2% is usually the percentage most economist would agree is safest.  Right now it is around 5% according to the latest CPI (Consumer-price index), but that is not really too bad.    Now if you're comparing it to foreign currencies, it has been going down because we import way more than we export.  Think of it this way: we buy a whole bunch from China.  Now China has all these dollars and wants to convert it to their currency so they sell the dollars.  This means that on the foreign market there is probably a surplus of U.S. dollars floating around which causes the value to decrease against other currencies.  If we exported more than we imported the opposite would be happening.|`|AA12358300	less than that depending on where you are spending...|`|LW9bu929aa	well look at it this way...you used to be able to buy a soda for 1 dollar..now it is 1.25 or even 2 dollars some places.

115337554e500a655e4ce026b88426f3aa	Todos tendemos a acreditar que o sofrimento  um sinal de amor verdadeiro, que se recusar a sofrer por amor  egosmo, e que se um homem tem um problema a mulher deveria, ent?o, ajud-lo a mudar. Estas s?o algumas das cren?as que ajudam a criar os sintomas de mulheres que amam demais, o vcio de amar.    Quando amar significa sofrer, n?o  amor,  dor. E dor  sinal de que algo est mal ou doente e precisa ser tratado, cuidado.    Isto n?o pode ser feito pelo parceiro, n?o adianta querer que ele fa?a os curativos, amando incondicionalmente e que proteja de dores passadas e futuras.    Quando atribumos ao outro o poder de nos fazer felizes  porque temos dificuldade de gostar de ns mesmos,  falta de auto estima e de auto valoriza??o. Enfim,  falta de amor prprio, e amor prprio n?o diz respeito ao outro, mas a ns mesmos. Antes de ser uma dificuldade de relacionar-se com o outro,  uma dificuldade de relacionar-se consigo mesmo.    Como uma pessoa que n?o se ama pode conseguir acreditar que um outro poderia am-la? Parece difcil, n?o?    N?o se sentir digna de amor e incapaz de cuidar de si mesma gera uma imensa necessidade de ser amada, para cobrir esse vazio, e um grande medo de ser rejeitada e abandonada. Esta  uma cren?a bastante limitante e, portanto, um caminho estreito em dire??o ao sofrimento. Esta postura mental certamente  refletida a nvel comportamental, passando uma mensagem inconsciente que atrair homens inadequados e inacessveis para cumprir a auto profecia criada pela cren?a que diz que ela ser abandonada por n?o merecer amor.     Uma pessoa com este padr?o mental conseguir somente relacionamentos difceis e sofridos, o que n?o  nada sadio. Mas, apesar de sofrer, n?o quer sentir a dor do abandono e quer acreditar que a for?a do seu amor ou do seu sofrimento poder mudar o comportamento do outro e obter o amor que deseja. Assim se esfor?a e ama cada vez mais e mais.     assim que o amor se torna um vcio, onde a mulher se sente dependente deste homem. A fun??o do vcio de uma forma geral  anestesiar a dor de uma realidade intolervel. No caso do vcio de amar, a euforia da paix?o e at mesmo o sofrimento anestesia a dor maior de n?o se amar e de n?o se sentir capaz de cuidar de si mesma.     Sair desse crculo vicioso sozinha  quase impossvel.  necessria a ajuda de uma terapia e apoio de um grupo teraputico com profissionais especializados em relacionamentos. O primeiro passo  o reconhecimento e o caminho para resgatar o poder pessoal  o auto conhecimento.     Cren?as e valores funcionam em um nvel diferente da realidade e por isso difceis de mudar com regras de pensamento lgico e racional. Quanto menos nos conhecemos, mais chance temos de achar que somos errados enquanto pessoa. Atravs do auto conhecimento, aprendemos a arte de acreditar que podemos ser felizes e aumentamos nosso potencial para tanto. Reconhecemos em ns cren?as e talentos fortalecedores e transformamos as cren?as que nos limitavam criando assim condi??es para sermos verdadeiramente felizes e conseqentemente nos relacionarmos mais saudavelmente.    Ser feliz no amor  possvel. Para isso  preciso amar o outro. Para amar o outro  preciso amar a si mesmo. Para se amar,  preciso se respeitar. Para se respeitar  preciso se aceitar. Para se aceitar  preciso se conhecer.    Seja feliz.|`|802ac712d7f980f50f56ffa6c345c8ccaa	 uma das piores dores que existe,  realmente terrvel, triste e deprimente, s sabe do que se trata quem ja passou por isso...

Wenn dir dein WG Mitbewohner sagt "Bitte gew?hn dir an, auf dem Balkon zu rauchen" hat er nicht gesagt, dass du es in der Wohnung nicht mehr darfst :D Nur, dass du es auch mal auf dem balkon versuchen sollst :D    Wenn er aber sagt "Bitte gew?hn dir ab, nichtmehr in der Whg zu rauchen" dann musst du da durch und es ist schwieriger wie ich finde|`|975b874ba2988266c67f976d0c74e193aa	Ob Du Dir das Rauchen abgew?hnst oder das Nichtrauchen angew?hnst ist so ziemlich gleich leicht oder schwer,oder?|`|1f6c54b32c02154cbd38d5317ab35f87aa	Wenn du das Rauchen meinst ist meine Meinung, das angew?hnen !  Denn abgew?hnen kriege ich nicht hin.|`|d81b65588f4bbc8a8df3617bf2d69cc5aa	Definitiv angew?hnen.|`|bac948387dc020d8022302977e092a83aa	alles relativ . kommt wohl immer auf die umst?nde und den willen an ,denke ich mal . :-)|`|0e8596d6b6af5751a7842a1ee677d283aa	Auslegungssache.    Ich bin Rechtsh?nder.   Man k?nnte nun sagen, ich soll mir abgew?hnen mit rechts zu schreiben oder gew?hne Dir an mit links zu schreiben.     Beides ist gleich schwer ;-)|`|caa9d950bc11ddb42ca67f19eae0bb95aa	hey :)    Angew?hnen k?nnen wir sehr sehr schnell, dagegen Abgew?hnen das reinste kaos mit Frust und mieser Laune verbunden... kommt aber ganz auf die Person selber an... ob Willenskraft vorhanden oder  eben nicht... sagen wir's mal so es kommt ganz auf das eigene " wollen " an    have a good nice day :)*    LG  Michelle|`|dac087bdf4c5a3ae04a339c7b6d53279aa	Angw?hnen, denn Abgew?hnen braucht teilweise Disziplin.|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Das ist insofern schwierig, weil abgew?hnen oft bedeutet, sich etwas anderes anzugew?hnen.  Wenn jemand sich z.B. das Essen von Fleisch abgew?hnen will, muss er sich zugleich angew?hnen, sich v?llig anders zu ern?hren.  Wer sich angew?hnen will, in der Frh pnktlicher aufzustehen, muss sich oft abgew?hnen, sich nachdem der Wecker geklingelt hat, einfach nochmal umzudrehen.|`|b62f12a862d1de5fe36623bec7f8bcffaa	Wenn es das Selbe ist denn hei?t es doch "umgew?hnen" , oder?    oder einfach "Konditionierung",    in Verbindung mit "Positiver Verst?rkung" f?llt es leichter.|`|ZyNQZjdDaa	dein beispiel mit dem rauchen...so gesehn ist es eigendlich das selbe.....doch wenn man das anders nimmt und man sagt...gew?hne dir das rauchen ab und gew?hne dir an dich anders zu benehmen....das ist dann schwer|`|02e4f308e2997d9b68c492142f967901aa	ich glaube eher Angew?hnen    z.B. rauchen angew?hnen leicht, aber abgew?hnen schwer|`|e57289282137560929c14c886667c1cdaa	ein kilo federn oder ein kilo eisen?    kommt einfach drauf an was du dir ab- bzw. angew?hnen willst. manches geht total leicht abzugew?hen, manches schwer und genauso ists andersrum. eine einheitsantwort gibts da nicht|`|3690e27f5b37d6a179b4b9edd89a8671aa	eigentlich beides. schliesslich bedeutet das angew?hnen einer sache, das abgew?hnen einer anderen. z.b ich gew?hne mir an, immer mit licht auto zu fahren. das heisst ich gew?hne mir ab, nur in der dunkelheit mit licht zu fahren.|`|9acc791ddd985f9f66f4d2ecb2804edaaa	Angew?hnen ist in den meisten F?llen leichter:    zB rauchen, alkohol trinken  Das f?ngt man an und es ist schwer wieder damit auf zu h?ren.    Beim Geld aus geben ist es die Waage,     wenn man was hat, gibt man es aus  und wenn es weg ist, kann man sich schnell dran gew?hnen   die Flocken zusammen zu halten|`|44seMQPxaa	Das angew?hnen von Unarten (z.B. Rauchen,Alk,Drogen etc) ist einfacher als das abgew?hnen davon.

Wenn du unterwegs bist und alle trinken Alkohol bis zum Anschlag und du trinkst nicht mit, auch wenn dich alle auslachen.|`|c6b30b32de82c29715988efad46da1c3aa	Ja, kann es.    Beide Begriffe sind situationsbedingt interpretierbar.|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Wer offen zu seinen Gefhlen steht und diese zeigt und anspricht, wird in der Regel mehr Respekt von seiner Umwelt bekommen als derjenige, der irgendwelchen Normen und Rollenklischees folgt.  Leider haben diese Klischees ("Ein Indianer kennt keinen Schmerz", " Sein ein Mann", "M?dchen tun sowas nicht", usw.) einen so starken Einfluss auf uns, dass es oft einfacher erscheint, ihnen zu folgen, anstatt sich selber treu zu sein.  Deshalb erscheint uns der ehrliche Umgang mit unseren Gefhlen oft so schwer und es braucht in der Tat Mut um diese Hrde zu berwinden.|`|95cdaa4ba159e2349140fc7a7cc0315caa	Nicht unbedingt mutig...aber verdammt intelligent !!!|`|16efbec7ba99149302c11f97705bdf5baa	Sehr mutig,es beweist Gr??e.|`|d6c9a3565b80d8fb03c90d7b60edb43daa	ja das ist meistens sogar mutiger nein zusagen|`|fd622ece2bded5445cdb68d8e14afe6faa	Kommt immer auf die genaue Situation an manchmal ist es wirklich das beste was man dann machen kann.|`|c6d7f89631af9b010a2ab2c828aa637baa	Natrlich.

Besonnenheit hat weniger was mit Sonne als mit Besinnung zu tun. Sprich: Nachdenken, bevor man handelt, kommt auch meistens mehr dabei raus. (Bin manchmal selbst etwas zu impulsiv, sprich: sich um Kopf und Kragen zu reden bringt meistens wenig, ausser Kopf- und Kragenschmerzen lol)|`|90344dcdd465045885cfb6576ed8bd97aa	Mein Vater sagte immer: " Lieber fnf Minuten feige, als ein Leben lang tot!"  Wir recht er damit hat!|`|655798c33fcece3248415ff0d0e10d20aa	Wenn Du Feigheit in Deiner Frage mit Angsthaben gleichsetzt, sage ich: "Ja" kann es. Angst ist der natrliche Schutz unseres K?rpers vor unbekannten oder sogar gef?hrlichen Situationen. Manchmal ist es angemessen diese Angst zu berwinden und somit seinen Mut zu beweisen, manchmal (bei sogenannten Mutproben z.B.) ist der Mut einfach dumm und man tut besser daran auf die innere Stimme zu h?ren. Fr mich ist und war immer wichtig was ich selber denke und mit welcher Handlungsweise ich mich noch offen im Spiegel anschauen konnte, egal wie mich wer anderes danach tituliert hat.... und wahre Freunde sind die, die zu einem halten, egal fr welche Handlung man sich entscheidet... ich habe eine Handvoll davon und die sind mir mehr wert, als die vielen Hallo-Bekanntschaften die kommen und gehen.....|`|2fe9157a21f9c6c5b594d318ddcee9d1aa	Ja ist es.|`|c707760ae7b8f8097abe303b4ef780ceaa	Mut und Feigheit sind beides sehr zweischneidige Brder.    Eine feste Aussage ist nicht m?glich, da sowohl das Eine, als auch das Andere richtig oder falsch sein kann. Es ist nicht nur von der sekundenschnellen Entscheidung des Betroffenen abh?ngig, sondern auch von der Situation die vor ihm steht.  Wer feige wirkt, beherrscht sich vielleicht nur, damit ihm die Hand nicht ausrutscht und es zur Katastrophe kommt oder er hat aus reiner Feigheit tats?chlich verspielt..  Wer mutig ist, handelt richtig oder ist in Wirklichkeit ein Dummkopf. Wer wei? das schon vorher...|`|d8a4e20333330266b36482799b6cc9d0aa	Klar, denn Angst ist eine Schutzreaktion. Wrde man diese nicht spren, k?me es sicherlich ?fters als ohnehin schon vor, da? man in sein Unglck rennt. Und der Angst zu gehorchen gegen die Widerst?nde von anderen, ist sowieso sehr mutig.|`|ce7dcb2e6ca495c2234ec866c121fd92aa	es ist sogar mutiger!!!      Man denke mal an die Deserteure im Krieg!!!      die ,die angeblich todesmutig in erster Reihe stehen,haben tausende Gleichgesinnte um sich und ein Risiko zu sterben...  diejenigen,die desertieren,haben niemanden -und das doppelte Risiko!!!  haben die eigenen Leute und den "Feind" gegen sich....und falls sie das berleben,sp?ter den Rest ihres Lebens auch noch diese bigotte "Verachtung" zu ertragen....|`|db0bc59ec0b1a8512092ee7a49751b5baa	Mutig ist wenn du zu gibst das du feige bist!|`|37bf780764a0fd5a01a0aaed6dee956faa	klar, kommt aber immer darauf an .....

g584NGzNaa	To help make the dreams come less often and less severely, try going the to airport and actually watch Boeing planes land safely. You need to load you memory and there by communicate to you subconscious that such planes are safe and do land safely over and over.|`|AA11746917	I had those same types of dreams years ago and I spoke to a friend who interprets dreams, and this is what she told me: Your dream has nothing to do with a real plane crash. Whenever you dream about direction, like in your case the direction is downward because the plane is always coming down, that actually indicates the way you feel about yourself. On some level, you do not feel good about yourself or the direction your life is heading.
V9ZnqrlFaa	I have to say that your poor town is going through a very bad time. Being supportive of each other will help. Its your friends that will get ou through it.  When my mother died i didnt talk to anyone for a long time. I found that trying to continue on with life, keeping busy and in particular exercise helped me move forward. There were times though when I was alone and able to think about that the loneliness and how then depressed I felt came back.  You have to tell yourself to fight it and if you ever do feel low whatever u do do not be alone.  Perhaps some kind of memorial service for those recently departed would be a good tep forward and bring the community together. Afterwards have a get together, like a town picnic, just to lighten the mood of the community.  |`|AA11298562	Wow, that's rough.  Sounds like your whole town is going through a bad time.  Talk to each other, support each other, don't be afraid to talk about the people who have died, that's part of the healing process.  See if there's a counselor or therapist in town you can talk to; if not, talk to your local clergy, they're trained to help people in these situations.|`|iAVmZ8ahaa	 I am so sorry that words cannot express my feeling to hear,that someone you know or loved had just pass away.

She wants to be loved, but yes, those guys are just using her.  she's doing the old thing - trying to buy love with sex.  It never works.  Your sister needs to work on her self esteem.  She's worth more than this.  She needs to have a relationship first, before she sleeps with them.|`|lSeb6xHXaa	heaps of girls are like that, they try and "seem" hard to get, like they have many other offers and dont want to be tied down but they really just want to be wanted, they sleep with the guy hoping that he will want her even more and then they start to get too invoved then of course the rejection hits... this is the way of a lot of my firends, i think it comes down to insecurity|`|G1kdupY3aa	Your sister need to have some one-to-one talk therapy with an accredited PhD psychologist who has experience treating people with similar problems,|`|1JoR0LQVaa	They sure sound like jerks and playas!

If you care that your sister is hurting herself, talk to her. If she's complaining to you, tell her the truth as you see it, then leave it at that for her to think on.    She could very well be talking tough to disguise the pain she is experiencing at not being 'chosen' by any of these r00t rats she associates with. You could give her the nudge to slow down and see how she goes.     Let her know you're there for her but otherwise mind your own beeswax.    And if some random bloke she's r00ted tries to tell you all about it, have some loyalty and tell him to f*ck off.    A bloke who would have this conversation isn't interested in a 'relationship' (or not) with your sister ... he's only trying to find out if that Ry Cooder song is true!    Cheers :-)|`|gXHxf2G9aa	You don't say what age your sister is but I'm guessing she's in her teens.    It sound very much that she does want a relationship and quiet badly too.  When she tells the guys she doesn't want a relationship it sounds like she protecting herself from being hurt.  She most likley has very low self esteem and in her head if she can "control" the situation before they do well then she wins either way.    As for the sleeping with them on the first date that could be any number of things.  She could see that as a way of getting very close to a guy thus the expecting a relationship thing from them then.  Or she could see it as a pay off.  If they sleep with me they owe me.    Either way I think she just needs love.  I'm not sure what kind of love she needs but you could help her by reassuring her that she has got attractive qualities and men do find her attractive but she's giving out the wrong signals.      Hope this helped in some way :)
82aa67f0d93c0686f81f9489af51f7a0aa	wenn man sieht wie viele Kinder heut zu tage rauchen msste man es doch erst ab 18 erlauben .      Rauchst du schon mit 13 h?rst du e nicht mehr auf zu rauchen und ein 18 j?hriger wrde dann doch nicht mehr anfangen     ich habe mit 13 angefangen und rauche immer noch und bin schon ber 30     Gru? tommy|`|1974a9c65e42300c2d098ae369fb7458aa	Man sollte gar nicht mit dem Rauchen anfangen. Es sch?digt Lunge und das Herzkreislaufsystem.   Du bekommst Mundgeruch und gelbe Z?hne - ist es das wert?  Teuer ist es auserdem!|`|62fca20bf632b6ebc10fbacb148defffaa	Ntzt nichts,wird einfach im versteckten geraucht.|`|6e9139b9ad6f6a4de1462287b5c3001eaa	und wer will es den jngeren verbieten? Das klappt doch sowieso nicht, warum also solche Fragen?  Wirst du dich darum kmmern, dass alle jngeren dann nicht mehr rauchen?|`|f3eaf00f6c8d836ffb3ba4fd1d95e136aa	Als Jugendlicher fhlt man sich ja sooo erwachsen, ich war ja auch nicht anders. Wenn ich mir heute 16 oder 18-j?hrige anschaue, dann bemerke ich erst, wie wenig erwachsen die in Wirklichkeit sind.     Rauchen schadet Jugendlichen wesentlich mehr als Erwachsenen.  Und da nicht alle  Jugendlichen selbst so vernnftig sind, mssen eben Gesetze her.     Dann muss aber auch deren Einhaltung durchgesetzt werden.       Ich habe kein Verst?ndnis fr Eltern oder Freunde, die 12-j?hrigen Zigaretten kaufen - die Zigarettenbeschaffer geh?ren auch bestraft. Und Jugendliche, die rauchen, sollten zu Sozialarbeiten herangezogen werden k?nnen.     Ich bin selbst gem??igter Raucher, bin also kein Rauchgegner.  Der 12-j?hrige Freund unserer Tochter raucht und die Mutter besorgt noch die Zigaretten - ich habe dafr kein Verst?ndnis.    Als Eltern muss man nicht alle Wnsche erfllen, sondern fr die Gesundheit der Kinder Sorge tragen.     Die Eltern sind in der Pflicht, mit den Kindern zu reden, nicht nur ber das Rauchen. Und zwar schon rechtzeitig, nicht, wenn die Kinder schon rauchen. Es ist nie zu frh zum Reden - oft aber zu sp?t. Ich habe unsere Tochter mit 7 aufgekl?rt, die Wirkung von Alkohol und Zigaretten erkl?rt und sie schon von klein auf sensibilisiert.     Aber es ist ja einfacher, eine Spielekonsole zu kaufen als sich selbst um die Kinder zu kmmern. Unsere Tochter hat natrlich auch Computerspiele, auf das richtige Ma? kommt es an    Ich bin sehr tolerant, was die Jugendlichen angeht. Grne Haare, Piercing, Tattoos, das ist alles o.k. - das schadet ja nicht nachhaltig der Gesundheit.     Ich will das Kinderrauchen nicht kriminalisieren, aber es muss deutlich werden, dass das Sch?digen der Gesundheit nicht folgenlos bleibt.    Diese Einstellung hatte ich schon bevor ich meinen besten Freund, einen starken Raucher,  vor ein paar Monaten wegen Herzversagen zu Grabe tragen musste.|`|7dcf4d91922d4d06a4801bf4393403f6aa	Sch?n und gut,aber was soll das bringen?Jetzt ist rauchen ab 16 erlaubt,und trotzdem sieht man immer wieder 11-j?hrige Kiddies mit Fluppe im Mund.In dem Alter lockt doch am meisten der Reiz des Verbotenen,ob Zigaretten da ab 16 oder 18 legal sind,spielt doch keine Rolle!Wer welche haben will,kriegt sie sowieso irgendwie,ist doch mit Alkohol genau das gleiche.  Au?erdem mssten,um das wenigstens einigerma?en durchzusetzen,s?mtliche Zigarettenautomaten abgeschafft werden,und dagegen wrden wohl die meisten erwachsenen Raucher protestieren.Ich zwar nicht (kaufe immer auf Vorrat...),aber ich kenne ein paar Leute,die weiter au?erhalb wohnen und ne l?ngere Strecke unterwegs w?ren,um sonntags an Zigaretten zu kommen,wenn es die Automaten nicht g?be.Ist halt die Frage,ob sowas durchsetzbar w?re.  Der Staat ist sowieso scheinheilig,da werden Milliarden an Tabaksteuer eingenommen,aber gleichzeitig Anti-Raucher-Politik betrieben...|`|0aab77b2bddd168275bdfd26f77dc986aa	.nein, lieba erst ab 80.|`|561c0f1b9380350084d9201458c76511aa	Der Staat spinnt doch,er verdient am meisten daran|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Ein klares Nein.  Was sollen denn diese ganzen Versch?rfungen der Gesetze bringen? Man darf ja jetzt auch erst am 16 rauchen und trinken und nenne mir eine Person, die sich daran h?lt. Jugendliche rauchen und trinken schon mit 12 manche frher, aber sp?testens mit 14 war ein gro?er Anteil schonmal stock betrunken und hat schon geraucht. Ich denke auch nicht, dass da eine Gesetzes?nderung etwas bringen wrde. Au?er aus sozialen Wesen Verbrecher zu machen.  Ich denke eher, dass dadurch der Anreiz zu rauchen gesteigert wird. Aber vielleicht will ja genau das der Staat bewirken. Immerhin nimmt er eine Menge Kohle durch die Tabaksteuer ein.|`|0eac92270346402fba538ede3ebd0c54aa	ich finde es gut! nun sollten nur noch die ordnungshter bei jugendlichen die in der ?ffentlichkeit rauchen h?rter durchgreifen und ich w?re vollkommen zufrieden.|`|b893e0e47127c426c4ae7470435faca7aa	Meinet wegen kann die Tabakproduktion ganz eingestellt werden.

Habe aber die Kurve dann mit 33 Jahren bekommen und kann nur jedem empfehlen nicht zu rauchen. Man wird den Unterschied an der gesamten Kondition des K?rpers merken.

Eine pers?nliche und eine der Solidargemeinschaft. Rauchen nutzt nur dem Staat, die ganzen Kranken bezahlt jeder Einzelne durch seine Krankenkassen-Beitr?ge.

Ich habe damals mein Kippe auch mit 13 Jahren bekommen ... nun rauche ich auch nicht mehr. Den Preis erh?hen bringt auch nichts in Holland sind die Kippen bis zu 80cent gnstiger und statistisch rauchen dort weniger. Ich denke man sollte mehr wert auf die frhe Erziehung legen. Man sollte solche Dinge schon in der Grundschule ansprechen und nicht die Kinder vor solchen Themen schtzen. ich rqauche pers?nlich nur noch 2-3 ZIGARRETEN in der Woche ich rauche nicht weil ich es brauche sondern als Entspannung.

39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	Niklas Luhmann (8 dcembre 1927 - 6 novembre 1998) tait un sociologue allemand, expert de l'administration, et thoricien des systmes sociaux, fondateur de la thorie des systmes sociaux.  Luhmann est considr comme l'un des reprsentants les plus influents du fonctionnalisme, lequel a t particulirement critiqu par Jrgen Habermas qui lui oppose sa thorie de l'agir communicationnel. Cette confrontation tient au fait que Luhmann rejette le concept d'action individuelle et s'intresse  la nature complexe des socits modernes en insistant sur le r?le des institutions qui grent et mettent en ordre cette complexit. Cet aspect de la thorie de Luhmann a souvent t rapproch du conservatisme de son ma?tre Schelsky qui accordait une attention particulire au r?le des institutions dans l'organisation et le maintien de l'ordre social.    Si Luhmann et Habermas s'intressent tous deux au phnomne de la communication, le premier l'envisage selon ses fonctions au sein du systme, alors que le second y voit la possibilit d'une thique de la discussion visant  renforcer l'intersubjectivit des sujets sociaux.    Luhmann reste toutefois attach  la thorie bien plus qu'aux analyses empiriques, ayant pour principe que si les socits sont complexes, elles demandent de la part du sociologue l'laboration de concepts non moins complexes pour en rendre compte adquatement. C'est dans cette perspective qu'il produit une ?uvre monumentale, passant en revue toute institutions sociales  travers la notion de complexit et d'autopo?esis (les systmes sociaux s'engendrant d'eux mmes).|`|f978f020401b2afd59cb4cb1b6ff33d1aa	La description de l'ordre social dans les termes d'une thorie des systmes est une ide nouvelle et brilliante.|`|AA11306617	Ah, qual , tu tambm falas Fran?ois?

O termo foi originalmente dado s bandas do cenrio punk de Washington, DC que compunham num lirismo mais emotivo que o habitual.  Existem vrias vers?es que tentam explicar a origem do termo "emo", como a que um f? teria gritado "Youre emo!" (Voc  emo!) para uma banda (os mitos variam bastante quanto a banda em quest?o, sendo provavelmente o Embrace ou o Rites of Spring).  No entanto, a vers?o mais aceita como real  a de que o nome foi criado por publica??es alternativas como o fanzine Maximum RocknRoll e a revista de skate Thrasher para descrever a nova gera??o de bandas de "hardcore emocional" que aparecia no meio dos anos 80, encabe?ada por bandas da gravadora Dischord de Washington DC, como as j citadas Embrace e Rites of Spring, alm de Gray Matter, Dag Nasty e Fire Party.  Nesta poca, outras bandas j estabelecidas de hardcore, como 7 Seconds, Government Issue e Scream tambm aderiram  esta onda inicial do chamado "emocore", diminuindo o andamento, escrevendo letras mais introspectivas e acrescentando influncias do rock alternativo de ent?o.   importante lembrar que nenhuma destas bandas jamais aceitou ou se auto-definiu atravs deste rtulo. A palavra "Emo" era vista como uma piada ou algo pejorativo e artificial.  O gnero (ou pelo menos o clssico estilo de Washington, o DC sound) primeiramente explorado por bandas como Faith, Rites of Spring e Embrace tem suas razes no punk rock.  O prximo passo na evolu??o do gnero veio em 1982 e durou at 1993 com as bandas Indian Summer, Moss Icon, Policy of Three, Still Life e Navio Forge. A dinamica calmo/gritado ("quiet/loud") freqentemente ouvida em bandas recentes tais como Seatia e Thursday tiveram suas razes nestas bandas. No que diz respeito a voz, essas bandas intensificaram o estilo emocore. Muitas delas sempre fizeram uso de berros e gritos durante a apresenta??o, e motivo para muitos f?s de hardcore depreciarem os f?s de emo como "molengas"1 ("wimps", "weaklings").  Assim como foi infundida uma nova intensidade para o emocore, o emotional hardcore levou essa intensidade a um nvel extremo. A cena teve incio entre 1991 e 1992 com as bandas Heroin, Portraits of Past e Antioch Arrow que tocavam um estilo catico, com vocais abrasivos e passionais2.  Aps a supervaloriza??o inicial da intensidade e da sonoridade catica, o emotional hardcore sofreu um processo de "desacelara??o". As bandas Sunny Day Real Estate e Mineral basearam seu estilo no Rites of Spring, outra banda do gnero emo.  Nota-se uma nova tendncia emo em abandonar o punk distorcido em favor de calmos viol?es. Na cultura alternativa diz-se que algum  ou est emo quando demonstra muita sensibilidade.  No Brasil, o gnero se estabeleceu sob forte influncia norte-americana em meados de 2003, na cidade de S?o Paulo, espalhando-se para outras capitais do Sul e do Sudeste, e influenciou tambm uma moda de adolescentes caracterizada n?o somente pela msica, mas tambm pelo comportamento geralmente emotivo e tolerante, e tambm pelo visual, que consiste em geral em trajes pretos,Trajes Listrados, Mad Rats, Cabelos Coloridos e franjas cadas sobre os olhos.|`|rvqvBMAYaa	Emo,EmoCORE    Procura em WIKIPEDIA.COM      HAHAHHAHAHA|`|xId5wibIaa	Os EMOs s?o pessoas que, para se mostrarem diferentes, s?o sentimentais ao extremo.

Usare la lavatrice a bassa gradazione, ed usare sopratutto  detersivi il meno dannosi per l'ambiente possibili.  4. Lavarsi i denti a secco, e cio senza acqua! Usare l'acqua solo per risciaquarsi in bocca e per sciaquare lo spazzolino da denti.  5. Recuperare l'acqua per la cottura degli ortaggi per fare il primo lavaggio dei piatti, stoviglie e.c.c!  6. Non lavare mai l'auto esteriormente, solo in casi estremi, chi se ne frega se non  pulit, si sciaqua quando piove!  7. Non annafiare l'orto, quindi meglio se non si ha l'orto.  8. Non tenere piantine, magari solo piantine tipo "cactus" che richiedono una minima quantit d'acqua!  9. Radersi la testa! Meno capelli si hanno, meno acqua si spreca!  10. Farsi la doccia a giorni alterni!  11. Vietato farsi il bagno!  12. D'estate usare l'acqua di scarico condensa dei condizionatori per annafiare i "cactus" o eventuali piantine a basso consumo d'acqua!  13. Recuperare l'acqua piovana, quando piove in contenitori adatti per lo stoccaggio, da utilizzare poi eventualmente per annaffiare piantine, orto e.c.c  14. e non ultima,quando si lavano i pavimenti non usare il metodo tradizionale ma il mio metodo, che non elenco qui, perch in futro sto prendendo in considerazione di trovare qualcuno che mi brevetti qualche mia idea....per in futuro, il mondo  pieno di gente con nuove idee, quindi non vedo perch dovrei dichiarare tutte le mie, almeno non per ora, tanto non gliene frega niente a nessuno di comportarsi bene...sono stato iscritto al W.W.F per pi di 20 anni ormai cercando di raccimolare nuovi iscritti e qui dalle mie parti in Emiglia Romagna, gliene ferga a poca gente....ma penso che dopo questa primavera estiva con l'entrata in un estate torrida, forse qualcuno cambiera presto idea.....b, bella domanda, ciao!|`|3d3724209ac1dc58da47b6bc88d72829aa	Un modo infallibile sarebbe quello di aumentare in modo sproporzionato il costo del' acqua, cosi tutti si preoccuperebbero di fare economia.|`|YBvJKdQYaa	Non bagnerei il giardino...|`|AhZgiWfjaa	applicherei le norme valide in tutta europa, ovvero che ci che usiamo per lavarci, lavare i piatti etc. vada poi a finire nella cassetta per lo scarico. questa cosa in italia ovviamente non esiste sotto forma di legge.  ogni volta che faccio la doccia raccolgo l'acqua e poi la uso per scaricare,  lavo i piatti con la bacinella invece che mettendo il detersivo ogni volta sulla spugna, etc...  e tu???|`|fc080a72877bb6a5e044fb15dd94ea28aa	non tirare lo sciacquone quando piscio.....  e gi sovente lo faccio.....|`|HCjDYTzWaa	purtroppo nn posso metterlo in pratica, chiuderei le fontanelle a getto continuo.|`|FwsOGX9Vaa	mi laverei una volta l'anno? ma non credo sia un buon modo per risparmiare....|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Baresi.|`|31b8e7f672d7f5d1b5260a4e458faff4aa	non mi laverei pi... per non credo che quelli che mi stanno intorno sarebbero molto felici...!    scherzi a parte... tante cose messe insieme... da me il comune si impegna abbastanza a diffondere tecniche per il risparmio dell'acqua.. riduttori dei gettiti propagande informative... e credo che ci vada apprezzato...    la loro parte l'han fatta, speriamo che quest'opera di sensibilizzazione abbia buoni effetti su tutti..!

Denomina-se mutualismo o tipo de simbiose na qual os organismos cooperantes, ou simbiontes, obtm um benefcio mtuo. Um exemplo  a rela??o da alga e do fungo nos lquens.    Na simbiose antagonstica, um organismo satisfaz suas necessidades provocando danos ao outro. Este tipo de associa??o  chamada de parasitismo.    Outro tipo de simbiose, conhecida como comensalismo, ocorre quando dois animais diferentes, n?o-parasitas, dividem o alimento. Esta rela??o  inofensiva para ambos que, em muitos casos, obtm vantagens     Simplificando: A simbiose  a coopera??o mtua entre duas espcies diferentes, uma se beneficiando da outra.

Il fait des critiques sur les nouveaux jeux, il voyage partout dans le monde.... Enfin il s'clate, il a trouv sa voie, tout comme ton fils doit trouver la sienne.

Ton fils est entr dans la spirale de l'chec qui conduit  avoir une mauvaise opinion de soi meme, mauvaise opinion qui empeche de faire des choix par la suite et de s'y donner  fond.  Il se laisse donc aller en s'enfermant dans un train train assez dangereux car sois en sur, il ne doit pas arreter de penser  ses erreurs.     Il a du laisser tomber l'cole car comme beaucoup  son age il ne devait pas savoir ce qu'il voulait faire et se sentait perdu.     Tout d'abord il faut essayer de lui donner confiance en lui. Cel commence par essayer de l'couter plutot que de parler et d'viter lui dire des trucs du genre oui mais regarde tu ne fais rien et etc... Bref lui montrer qu'il peut tout dire sans etre juger.  Enfin quand il semble attacher de l'importance  une dmarche comme par exemple ici de retourner faire ses tudes, il faut l'accompagner du mieux possible sans le forcer. Si il a une baisse de morale et qu'il ne veut pas le faire  un moment T alors attendre le moment suivant. Surtout ne pas s'nerver car d'un coup tu perd le rsultat des efforts que  tu as fais pour le motiver.    Bien souvent lutter contre l'chec c'est montrer  quelqu'un qu'il peut russir. Alors plutot que de donner dans le coup de gueule, essaie de te montrer comprhensif. Si ton fils choue il doit y avoir une raison, surement son estime de lui meme.  Cel peut etre bon de lui demander franchement si il n'est pas tout simplement bloqu par la peur d'y arriver.   Si il dit oui alors il faut lui montrer toutes ces choses qu'il a russi  raliser par lui meme. Bref lui redonner confiance en ses capacits, une fois ceci fait, se devrait tre assez facile de le motiver  tenter de nouvelles expriences. Et si dans ce cas il se retrouve de nouveau confront  l'chec alors il faut lui faire comprendre que tenter quelque chose c'est dj une forme de russite en soi. Quand il aura compris ?a de lui meme il ira de l'avant.    Bon courage|`|mHU39n3Iaa	Dites-lui que vous l'aimez mais que vous tes dsol de plus pouvoir le prendre en charge.|`|eovpz4nKaa	Bonjour! Je comprends tout  fait votre fils. Je suis passe moi aussi par l, j'ai arrt mes tudes  deux reprises (au niveau universitaire) parce que je n'arrivais pas  me dcider au sujet du mtier que je voulais faire, ni quel tait mon talent, ma passion. La diffrence avec ton fils, c'est que je passais mon temps  lire dans ma chambre au lieu des jeux vidos. Je suis devenue, par hasard, traductrice free-lance. Je re?ois des textes  traduire par msn. Vu que votre fils passe ses journes  jouer avec des jeux vidos, il a d? dvelopper certaines aptitudes qu'il pourrait peut tre utiiser dans un travail li  ce sujet, comme la conception de nouveaux jeux vidos par exemple... S'il n'a pas continu des tudes jusqu' prsent, c'est parce que ca ne l'intressait pas, mais s'il se retrouve dans une branche de travail qui le passionne, il finira bien par vouloir obtenir des qualifications (dipl?me) pour se hisser plus vite. Il ne peut pas faire des tudes uniquement pour faire plaisir  sa mre, sinon il l'aurait dj fait. Il a juste besoin d'une motivation plus forte. Courage!

J est?o sendo discutidas medidas para conter uma eventual implanta??o de uma monocultura de cana, garantir renda ao produtor individual - que n?o tem usina - e criar um rg?o estatal nico que centralize as decis?es a respeito do tema.     "Pela importancia que tem todo esse setor de bioenergia, existe a idia de se criar um rg?o que centralize toda essa discuss?o", disse ao Grupo Estado o ministro da Agricultura, Reinhold Stephanes. Segundo Stephanes, a ministra da Casa Civil, Dilma Rousseff, tem centralizado as discuss?es sobre agroenergia em reuni?es sistemticas envolvendo outros ministrios e a Petrobras. Os planos, no entanto, s?o de destinar as defini??es sobre o tema a um nico rg?o.    Uma das regras em estudo  determinar que pelo menos 70% da produ??o de cana consumida por uma usina seja proveniente de produtores individuais. Alm disso, o governo pretende reduzir o prazo das queimadas da cana e fazer com que as usinas tenham uma vis?o social sobre a participa??o dos trabalhadores ao longo de todo o processo.

For example:  If your friends dog got hit by a car and died and you also had this happen to you in the past you would be empathetic towards him. He would probably be upset and sorry and since this had happened to you before you know exactly how he feels.    BUT if this happened and something like this never happened to you before and he was upset, you would be sympathetic toward him. You are sorry he is feeling the way he is, but don't share the same feelings and emotions.    Remember....S in Sympathy = Sorry  E in Empathy = Emotional|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone elses shoes, and feel what they are feeling for a moment.    There isnt really a kind of empathy, it is what it is.    Imagine for a moment when you were mean or rude to someone, now put yourself in their shoes, and someone is mean or rude to you, how do you feel? Think about that the next time you get irritated with someone.
8yE2sYGeaa	You feel that you are not in control of your life and being help at the whims of others
CHlxBbkHaa	If you are struggling to make ends meet then you shouldn't have kids.  I had a friend who couldn't pay her utilities bills on time and completely, couldn't afford payments on her car, borrowed money for her rent, and she still focused on getting pregnant.  I'm not impressed by that kind of stupidity.  You have no business bringing life into this world if you can't even stand on your own two feet.|`|kLsi8aHuaa	Wonderful. I think world peace is a nice idea, too. And gosh it sure would be nice if everyone would pay all their taxes. And imagine what would happen if there was no government waste? I wonder what costs us all more - supporting single parents on welfare, government waste, uncollected taxes, or one of those international military missions we certainly have seemed to enjoy over the past seven years.|`|XKAZTv0Daa	Makes me laugh when people become the arbiters of right and wrong.    I bet you are a Republican|`|ziHYFQpkaa	i completely agree|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I absolutely think it is irresponsible.  Now I can give someone one mistake.  Your young, you get pregnant or you get pregnant by the wrong person.  OK.  But welfare, for anyone, should be temporary, used only to allow someone to pool their resources and get them back on their feet.  And the people on welfare.  Sorry, no cable TV, coach bags, nice cars or tax refunds for you.    The fact of the matter is that there are plenty of people whose families have been on welfare for generations.  It is their way of life.  They get free health insurance, free housing, while the hard working Moms or families in this country have to bust their hump to get half of that.  It is shameful.|`|1fruneZ1aa	Absolutely. Family planning is a basic adult responsibility.|`|lsHsXXtuaa	yes|`|3e3a79551e54dcec91edbfed2b6166eaaa	Yes I guess so. I am a single mom I work 3 jobs to support her. and the one thing i am happy about is that i am able to put a roof over her head without any help from other tax payers. I made a mistake and I will pay for it. it makes no sense to make everyone else pay for MY mistake.    But sometimes people may not plan on being a single mom. I know I didn't plan on it. and she has the baby. and then she may lose her job then yes I think she should get help till she can find another job.     But when you keep having kids with out being able to afford them it seems so unfair to the kids. now accidents happen God knows I know that. but if you keep doing it over and over time to look into maybe slowing down a little.    Why do you think that it's hard being a single mom now everyone thinks all you do is sit back and wait till your check comes in NOT true for a LOT of single mom's who work their buns off. just like single dad's OK I will be quiet now. God Bless|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Completely agree.  Time to tie some tubes if people insist on consuming all of our tax money.  Such a waste.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	If you go to adopt a pet, you have to prove you know how to properly care for it and have an interview to be sure you're getting it for the right reasons. You're also asked about whether or not you can afford to care for it, feed it, regular vet visits, yaddayadda.    When we think this is a good practice for owning a pet, you'd think we'd be progressive enough to make parents go through the same.    To adopt, you have to meet certain criteria, meanwhile anyone who's fertile is allowed to just do whatever they like. Terrible.     Virtually every other job requires education and some kind of certification, meanwhile the most important job in the world has none. Awesome! -_-    As for the welfare thing, of course I think it's irresponsible if you know this is how you're going to support yourself and your baby.    People rape the system all the time though, unfortunately. Here you can get gov't cash for 2 years. There's some women (men too, someone's getting them pregnant) who plan it out and make sure they have another baby before the time limit expires. I knew of one, she pretended she had no idea who the father was, meanwhile they lived together and had 4 kids by the time I'd lost touch with them.     Sadly, that couple isn't the only pair weasely enough to pull this **** =o(|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Sure it is, but it's impossible to expect all parents to meet those lofty standards.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Yeah...but it's not ONLY single moms that go on welfare.   My family was on government assistance when my husband got laid off from his job and I was 8 months pregnant with our second child.  Just long enough for him to find another job, but still...we were welfare people. That's what it's there for.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	Darlin', I couldn't agree with you more. I knew a woman who had 5 kids and told me about her government assistance. She worked at a church, but obviously didn't aspire to much more than having more kids for us to pay for.    Most single mothers I know work their butts off and pay their taxes, and they have my utmost respect.|`|FL67UPPHaa	No woman chooses to raise her children on government assistance. It keeps you barely above the poverty line, and if there was another option I'm sure she'd take it. Nor do women choose to be single mothers.    I'm glad that live in a society where mothers and children are given financial support, rather than being left to starve on the streets. I don't think a society that places so much emphasis on sex can then turn around and deny women support when they become pregnant.    The welfare state was introduced to give support to the most vulnerable people in society. I can't think of anything better to spend our taxes on.    Edit: I don't believe that. It takes two to create a child, and it's usually the father's choice not to be involved in his child's life. Single mothers are caused by deadbeat dads.    Some already pregnant women may choose to keep their baby rather than abort it because they know that support is available for them, as it should be. But that's completely different to intentionally getting pregnant when you have no means to support the child.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I agree. If you want to have kids, you should have to be able to afford them.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Absolutely...but then in general humans are pretty irresponsible critters anyway...so snit happens.|`|rD5HyZyeaa	I get what you're saying and agree completely - but I think the bigger (more tragic) issue is why are people who are completely unprepared as parents bringing children into the world? I see so many children who have little to no emotional support from their parents, like having the child was something they wanted to do at some point in time, but not something they wanted to keep up with. I wish more than anything that parents would understand what an undertaking and commitment - financially, emotionally, and otherwise - having children is. People who have children for the sake of it ("oooh.. I want a babyyy.. they're so cute!") or because they're hoping to get more money (I don't know that I've seen this firsthand) from the government make me sad. I know two women who allowed themselves to get pregnant for the sake of keeping a boyfriend - one stayed and one didn't. Just all kinds of crazy reasons. It's really scary. I know unplanned children are not uncommon, but comeon people...|`|nhZb43pIaa	Yes, I completely agree. If your receiving government support then you should have to have a depo (birth control) shot in the arm every 3 months. If you don't get your shot then you don't get your check.  Once your off welfare stop taking the shots.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Kind of, but sometimes things happen accidentally and the woman doesn't want an abortion (which is reasonable). I think it's very rare people do it deliberately for welfare. It's much easier and better-paying just to work.    There are lots of situations where it's irresponsible to have children but sadly those people are irresponsible and don't think about it.    Harriet|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Yes, I do.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Yes.  There are a lot of women who end up pregnant, don't mean to, and don't feel like abortion is an option.  In those cases, I understand needing some help until they get on their feet, but they need to make the effort to get on their feet and take adult responsibility.  WIC only covers minimal nutritional requirements for the baby, and covering this means far less problems (and costs) for the child going forward.  However, women who purposefully get pregnant, knowing fully well they can't or won't pay for the child's expenses, make me furious.  Absolutely furious.  To me, they have no concern for the child, and they are basically stealing from their community who has to foot their bills.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	Well it isn't very smart to do so, you can't support anti abortions and not accept welfare, this is a very very hard question to answer, because needy people need help and greedy people shouldn't get it, I would say make the mother provide more income to offset the the states burden, more kids she has then the more income she will need to provide,regardless of the Friend of the court. making baby's should not be considered a career choice when the means of support isn't there. I believe in helping people that want to help themselves, but don't make the working tax payer your sugar daddy, get into the work force and start producing and pulling your weight, or go to school and learn a new career, but don't give a bunch of excuses why you can have baby's and can't work. even a home based business will work as long as you put in so many hours, or volunteer so much of you time in the community, if she likes kids, them try watching someone else's kids so they can work.at least your are contributing to the neighborhoods strength, which is Strong families make strong community's|`|HLkRbKRNaa	unless the mother is a widow|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	I honestly don't believe women become single parents solely for the purpose of receiving government assistance.  It costs less to be childless.

Every minute spent crying/worrying about what you don't have...is another minute gone to waste. you only live once, make the most of it. I know how you feel, im going through it too. What keeps me going is that, i have a family who loves me unconditionally and friends...there are people out in south africa...who don't even have that glamorous benefit.    Once again, i and you do not need a man to smile/happy/live because listen...they will eventually leave you.    Love, is fascination. it gives one hope/reason to live. Its not a bad thing. However, you dint need one person to show you about what love means. JUST LOVE YOURSELF, girl!    PEACE.  hope you stay happy.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	Dear Untouched       I find it interesting that you about an emotion you don't really believe in... maybe you can look for a guy or girl that really isn't there.|`|6bO9meW9aa	Try to stop focusing on that one thing so much. Love is the ruler of many people's lives, but some people don't know the real meaning of love. If you want to know the real meaning of love, ask God. He loved this horrible abortion filled, homosexual loving, sex-before marriage doing world and had his Son die for us. Now that's real love. Try learning more about Him, and you won't hate love so much. :)|`|F0nJbK53aa	No, don't hate dating!  That's a horrible idea.    Anyways, just tell yourself that someday you will be ready.  I never really believed in love either and was confused that I'd be doomed to single forever, but I was fine with it as long as I had friends and could peacefully have a crush on the pool-boy or that guy at Starbucks.  But I eventually ended up with the Starbucks boy.  sigh!    The main thing is you have to remember that love will NOT take over your life.  Love is an accessory, a privilege, not a chore and not a job that you will have to put everything else aside for.  Love happens when you least expect it.  You can't plan it like you can a college degree.    Think of love as an activity you can either participate in or can watch from the side line for fun.  Just because you have never done it or want to just yet doesn't mean you have to push it aside from your mind.      It's OK to think about love.|`|6m2y0mQmaa	you say you don't want love, but i think that the thing you want the most; why? because you are avoiding it. love will come when you ready, flow through life & it will come.|`|8fyEZtyNaa	how many times are you gonna ask this? okay, one last time. just think of all the horrible things attributed to dating. make yourself hate dating! make yourself hate love. if you get yourself disgusted with it, then all is good.
anLdtPQwaa	Sure women and men are equal in the sense that they deserve the same amount of respect, love, and justice. They are equal in the sense that they should be TREATED as equals. Men are naturally and biologically stronger. It's a fact of life. A man (physically) is stronger than a woman because that's just how it is and how we're made. Putting a man and woman to fight is wrong, because the man would win. Unless the woman is incredibly strong. In a natural case, a man would win because he is physically stronger and built that way. But I believe men and women are equal in the sense that they both deserve the same respect and justice. :)|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	Sure they could fight equally but they would have to be equally balanced like in boxing or wrestling.  :)|`|NNHdkLDWaa	No first off I do not think men and women are equal and secondly somewhere along the way equal rights got confused with, we are equal.

Even with gender biased laws passed to give favor to women they still won't be equal.     @Marley.    How is it easier for a woman to get laid off than a guy. All you have to do is lie about some phantom sexual harassment or say that he hates woman and he will be fired. You have to do something really stupid for your boss to even consider firing you, because he knows you could just turn around and sue him for some non existent sexual discrimination that never happened.|`|fJy0vN7daa	No not one bit. I would say equal in value and potential etc etc.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	men and women should be equal.  but there are just somethings neither sex cannot or should not do.  its as simple as that and that is the way nature made it.  men are built for strength, woman for nurture.  yet when it comes to life in general, men and women should be equal.  in the workplace, when they vote, everything.  but to put a man and a woman up to fight would be wrong.  its very likely the man is going to win, and u are taking the issue of equal rights a little too far.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	We are supposed to be equal in the eyes of society and the law.      But, equal in ability...  not even close on a whole.  Sure, there are some individuals who are exceptions.    For fighting...  Well it's not really a fight because it's not going to last.....  As long as you don't hit her with a closed fist....  I believe that's why it's call a b**ch slap.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	We're all human.    No one is the same, however.  A woman is different than other women, men are different than other men, and men and women are different from each other.    To say we're not "equal" is to say we're not deserving of human rights.  There's a difference between saying we're not equal as opposed to saying we're different.  We're all equally human, we are all different as humans.|`|cbsAZVNQaa	I don't think were equal. women are superior..
XPrsJBnvaa	Often, it's difficult for some people to put themselves in others' shoes.  I think part of it is nature and part of it is nurture.  By that I mean that some of it is just "how you're made" and part of it is how you're raised.|`|RBQrgByeaa	I think it's lack of conscience. I don't think my wife has one. She operates on animal wants and needs.|`|slHUNl58aa	If you have empathy it makes it hard to say hurtful things even if they are for the persons own good.  If you lack empathy it is easy to be cruel because you do not have the ability to put yourself in others shoes.  frankly the lack of empathy I have seen in people when it comes to social sites on the internet was a surprise at first. Now it just makes me sad.  I think most people that have the need to hurt others are hurting and frustrated themselves and want to strike out at others as a result.|`|tJa60S4Taa	some are sadistic or psychopathic  some are kind and nice people|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Everyone is different ?|`|VPGAQQK7aa	some ppl r sociopathic and others arent|`|qTRbXleUaa	Cause they love them or they don't want them to be mad at him/her for what that person did.       Some ppl just don't care|`|wXWjPbizaa	It depends on the amount of empathy a person has. If they have very little, they can't really feel or understand the pain they inflict on other people, so hurting others comes very easily to them. If they have a lot of empathy, like me, they can't stand to see another person in pain, and would never inflict pain because they know it will make another person hurt and they will hurt too. For instance, I accidentally hurt a girl's ankle when we were playing catch and my ankle hurt for a week. Not because I hurt it, but because I hurt hers. Weird I know.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	The ones that have trouble hurting others have morality, deeper feelings and the ability to be empathetic, where the other people can only understand there own small world and scope of their own feelings.|`|6m2y0mQmaa	"The inclination of one's heart and soul, and the alignment with good or evil.

I used to know someone like this. He once told one of his earlier girlfriends that they never went out with eachother at all, that she should just kill herself, and that she was dead to him. He always wanted attention and would crack a well-placed joke about people or things just to hear them laugh at him. He was known was for being an arrogant know-it all who could crack jokes but not even expressly state his gratitude, nor any reciprocal form of expression compared to other people. At the same time, he would often enjoy putting people on guilt trips and make them sympathetic, then say that he didn't want pity, then ignore, then repeat the same thign over and over again. Or say somethign abotu his friends like, "oh that guy brian is coming along, he's such a loser, I dont' want to be with him, let's run", **** like that.

zyKQPLqQaa	Have you tried self-hypnosis?  Relax and visualize yourself in different public places being relaxed and comfortable - when people look at you they are friendly, just noticing who is around them. You smile when your eyes meet. The world can be a friendly place, but if you are always looking at the negatives that is all you will see. Visualize yourself in relaxed, comfortable, happy circumstances.  It's just like when you visualize a parking place as you are leaving home and there it is when you get to your destination. Visualize every detail, how the ground or floor feels beneath your feet, the smells, the temperature, the sounds. If you visualize them all as friendly circumstances that is what you will create for yourself. Use an anchor like pressing your thumb and middle finger together tied to a feeling of relaxation. You can find self-hypnosis and visualization techniques on YouTube. You may want to work on your self-esteme, most everyone does. Stand tall, if you are friendly to others they will be friendly to you.    Good luck to you.|`|nPGyKR4taa	because you are just nervous, it happens to me all the time.|`|pUkFH8D0aa	is it so wrong to not want to relax in front of other people na it's ok|`|kCV37nOgaa	its called pubic disorder  it means ur having uncomfortable feelings in your pubical area and that you are in need of a doctor to give you medicine in order to fix these out bursts, then you will be able to go to ur prom =]]|`|fG4dMAr7aa	you got a self-confidence-issue|`|8OvTtGiZaa	GET A ROOM!!!!|`|uJEzLVXsaa	Well sometimes you just can't take it when you are pressured by so many eyes notcing you.

A lot of people are like that.  I am, especially in places I've never been to.  But once I am there for a while I can relax.  Try a park that isn't used often, or a library.  I never go to a library.  But there are a few very small parks in my area that aren't used a lot and have bench's and tables and all that.  Try to find something like that.
59vpcHuhaa	I went through that phase myself. I've made my mom cry and my dad would yell at me everyday. My sister told me one day that I should leave the family because I've been such a burden to them. I've seen therapists, but they didn't help much because I didn't want to open up to them because I was so ashamed of myself. My grades were slipping because all I wanted to do was just sleep and cry and abuse myself physically and emotionally.  My life made a complete 180 when I met new people. My new friends really did change my life because I realized that my old friends weren't supportive of me and didn't care enough to help me see what I've become. So I would say that positive people helped me look at life in a different perspective.  Also, because I used to be like you, I would say that thinking about how much you hate yourself makes it worse than it already is. If you can't love yourself, you can't see how you can change yourself. I had to force myself to list a few positive things about me and my life to get it through my head that life isn't so bad, or that I should look at it in a different light and at least try to make improvements. Trust me when I say that there is ALWAYS a way to change and it's never too late. You don't have to be perfect, but show your loved ones that you are making YOUR best effort and they will love you for that.|`|KDCXd3B0aa	Sometimes, we have this huge pressure to be nice to others, and to put others first.

Cos theres nobody at all like you around, your amazing, an individual I can't find you anywhere else. Your a whole new perspective of the world. Your in control of you. We all make mistakes. We cant live being perfect people, it's imposisble. That's why we forgive and forget, move on. There is no such thing as 'failing'. It's just learning from mistakes. And theres numerous amounts of times you can learn and learn from mistakes. Your recogising what you did was wrong, that's fine, that's good, it means your not an evil person. You know morals.

gMfDF6meaa	Looking out a window refers to looking at opportunities. The monkey represents insight or your ideas. The fact that the monkey was without a parachute (security and safety) may be important. When the monkey fell, you didn't have the heart to look.   This dream could mean several things but here is one idea: that you are letting go of an attitude, belief or habit (letting go of what you believed in, had security in), and you still have tender feelings about it     Best of luck.
c43f26b35fd2c101684bacc71222fdbdaa	Because too many people are on Yahoo Answers and not enough are out in the real world spending money. Seriously though, its because housing prices in some areas like San Francisco and Miami were rising faster than America's obesity. People got greedy and when everyone woke up the prices came back to Earth and people who owned the inflated properties got stuck with mortgages that were higher than what their homes were actually worth. Not too mention every corporation finds it fashionable to fire its employees by the thousands nowadays. Now you have a bunch of laid off people with mortgages higher than their home's actual value. Not a good combo. Also manufacturing is dead in America and we buy more things then we sell.|`|Lpw41OLdaa	we spend all the money to war|`|5Snex2peaa	Economists don't either.

The latest stupid mess was bidding up the price of houses too far and going into debt to buy the too high bids.  The bubble BURST!

But you should award yourself with sometime for yourself. Sometime, say on the weekend, where you do what you enjoy doing.  Music can be a great stress buster. Go to a music concert and hear light music that you light.  Try adding new friends to your life. It won't cost anything and is good.  Try to negotiate and establish synergistic relationships with people around you. Do something to show them that you love them and care for them..Say buy a little present...Gradually they will soften...I am just trying to go to the root cause rather than just the symptoms....sorry if you feel I am answering something that you didn't asked.    Your dreams are also affected by the thoughts before you sleep. It may sound absurd to some but try visiting a church on sundays and pray before you sleep. Sometimes, spirituality works magic on stress and there is no harm in just giving a try.    Good Luck :)|`|SoBDnCx5aa	you need to think of something very enjoyable before you go to bed, or do something awsome and fun before you sleep so that is all you think about|`|ukF0Oqg8aa	Queen,    I know the pain, literally.  I was grinding my teeth everynight and my jaw killed me.  Then, they told my I had "Bruxism" and I didn't even know what that was.  Some of it was due to my bad thoughts and dreams at night.  My mom sent me to the dentist, who then sent me to a therapist.  What was going on?  My friend then told me about this program:    http://TheBestListOnline.Com/cure-teeth-...

qD2wkU1Vaa	My good times ended when I was in 3rd grade. From then on, it's been either a hell ride. In 3rd grade, I moved schools, not saying goodbye to anyone.  6th grade, I started feeling fat, and peer pressure got to me. I started experimenting with ways to get skinnier, and it soon developed into my binging, starving, and my super slow metabolism today.  In 7th grade, things started going downhill. I felt lonely, unstable, and started cutting. No friends, family, or anyone knows about this.  Right now, I'm in 8th grade. My grandma died a few months ago. I still cut, I still starve, binge. I feel fat everyday. I've even went so far to contemplating suicide. This year is my last year with my friends who I've been with for 5 years. Next year, I'm moving to a different high school, a fresh start.   But all this **** I've went through, it's gone on to make me a better person. I believe that I will learn from these mistakes, and not make them in the future. I don't know if my problems can stop, or when they'll stop, but sooner or later, they will.|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	On my fifth birthday, while playing a game of hide and seek, I fell into an open well pit.

Sounds depressing, huh?|`|5EWoZsDIaa	The major turning points in my life always happened when I was feeling either "pain" (not exactly physical but emotional, you name it) or emptyness. So its a warning sign that says "its time to make some changes".     What motivates me is when I have a strong conviction of what Im doing. But I also try not be so strick because along the way maybe something else comes along, and sometimes the "road" is more than a "road"- sometimes the "road" that you think is taking you to "this" goal can be fulled of surprises and then we can make turns and so on. So I like to enjoy the journey as well, stay tunned you know, try to have fun alog the way and an open mind. Good things always comes, either you get to your goal, either not.
9D08eHn7aa	The govt. can take actions through fiscal policy.  They can either change the amount of government spending which has a positive relationship on output or they can change taxes which have a negative relationship with output.      During the Great Depression FDR introduced the New Deal.  This created a lot of government programs (some of which are still around today) and i can't remember what happened with taxes.  Anyway, there is great debate over whether this helped or hurt the recovery process.     One thing to note about increased G is that it takes away from private businesses borrowing.  If the government wants to borrow, it will borrow... this decreases investment.  Obviously this harms businesses... and private citizens who work for these firms.    Actually, it will be interesting to see if they do pass Obama's stimulus package because during the Great Depression, Hoover never passed a bank bailout... which George Bush did a few months ago.  This supposedly will keep things liquid, but that remains to be seen.      I just hope our children's children's children's tax dollars aren't being wasted  (haha... I think)|`|awuGFzOPaa	There is no Constitutional role for the federal government. Prior to the Great Depression all recessions were called depressions, however that one was deeper and lasted longer than any other. The rest of the world only had a depression and was out of it many years before the USA.     Two things caused that one to be worse. One was having a central bank that was created in 1913 and they kept interest rates too low for too long creating the "roaring 20's". Much like today, the Fed has kept rates low for two decades creating the dot com and housing bubbles. Also,   hyperinflation had not occurred in history until the creation of central banks.     The other was government intervention and specifically the spending that FDR did. He spent so much money and instituted so many regulations on business that it killed the economy. When government spends it has to first take it from the private sector which stunts jobs and growth. Add to that all the new regulations FDR imposed (price and wage controls etc.) and the investors were afraid to put their money into something the government might take control of. Same as today with the government wanting to nationalize businesses, investors are jumping out of the market.     Recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, it serves to weed out excess and inefficient businesses and investments. When prices become overinflated (housing) recessions bring the cost of things down for new investors.     The government is about to create a depression with all the spending they are doing now. This will not be a "stimulus", it will cause foriegn investors to withdraw funds and cause hyperinflation within 1 to 2 years because the Fed is just printing the money.     Study up on hyperinflation

Or if he actually forbids you to have certain friends.  He is demanding and inconsiderate, and never listens to anything you say or wants to hear about your dreams or desires. When you go on a date, it's always of his choosing.  He will criticize you in public, and make fun of your clothes and hair style. He will ogle other women, knowing it upsets you.  Then he gets angry when you are upset.  Finally, he will start threatening you.  That's way past the time you should show him the gate, give him a big push out of it, and get a vicious dog to keep him from jumping over it.  If you get tied to a person like this, expect many bruises, black eyes and broken jaws.  He is an abuser.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I will tell you this in regard to men, can apply to the opposite sex if appropriate too. You need to spend time with that person and in several different scenarios, such as having someone call while you are out with him and see if he gets possessive or angry. How will they react if early on in the relationship you take a weekend off to visit a good friend with him or go somewhere with that friend ??? See how he treats someone he doesn't really have to be nice to, such as a waitress or cleaning person, that is a good clue. Listen to him talk about other women, if he disrespects them and calls names, even an ex-wife or ex-girlfriend, that is  a good clue. Ask him about his mother and relationship with her, if he doesn't respect her most likely he won't respect you either. Even if she was irresponsible and not a good mother, he should be able to have a civil conversation about his feelings for her. Watch how he reacts under stress that has nothing to do with you, can he keep his cool or does he have a temper or some bad habit to distract himself??? Can he talk openly about his feelings?, if not, then he will bottle up his emotions and they have to be discharged somehow later on.  Watch and see if he makes some little  mistakes, is he a big enough person to take responsibility and admit it? or does he put blame on someone or something else for his mistake? Is he two-faced with other people, talk about them like a dog and then so sweet to their face? He can do that to you to especially in the beginning . Most women or men I know (including me) had red flags before they got committed to an abusive partner, and either made excuses or let it slide after an apology.|`|2Ug3CU1Saa	If they're clingy it usually shows they'll be very possessive, which can potentially lead to violent behavior.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	How they treat animals is always a telltale sign.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

b8kbeVx2aa	A free market is a market that is free of government intervention and regulation, besides the minimal function of maintaining the legal system and protecting property rights, and is free of private force and fraud. In a free market property rights are voluntarily exchanged at a price arranged solely by the mutual consent of sellers and buyers.    Mercantilism is an economic theory that holds that the prosperity of a nation is dependent upon its supply of capital, and that the global volume of trade is "unchangeable"    In social philosophy, a free market economy is a system for allocating goods within a society: purchasing power mediated by supply and demand within the market determines who gets what and what is produced, rather than the state. Early proponents of a free-market economy in 18th century Europe contrasted it with the medieval, early modern, and mercantilist economies which preceded it.    Mercantilism was the dominant school of thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). Domestically, this led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established.|`|rp7ghi4Uaa	Free Market Economy - Private companies work for their own money and the government is not involved    Mercantilism - The government controls companies actions and their objective is to make the country more rich and powerful.

72H4hFaHaa	I haven't heard of any friendship or love relationship yet, where the partners lived up to each others idealization or expectation.  To achieve the perfect friendship or love relationship you have to accept your partner as he or she is.

Imagine how you would feel if your partner put you on a pedestal to be someone you know you are not, can never be or worse, don't want to be.  We all have to stay true to what we are.

First off, I would make it mandatory that every one learn economics at a young age.  Don't wait til college or high school... the earlier the better!      I would lower the capital gains tax comparable to other nations.  I don't know if I would lower personal income taxes because the marginal propensity to save is actually increasing.  So we have a problem, a downward spiral, a ripple effect, whatever it is we need to restore confidence to the pessimistic consumer.      Increase government spending, but without all the pork!  Let's work on infrastructure... maybe underground powerlines for everyone?

They worship hiearchies and ignore the consequences of thier selfish power hungry greedy actions.  This is the root cause for the poor state of todays world economy!!!

0AeH1pVuaa	I do not know why there is such a "value" on this kind of "pleasure". It's not really something that can be argued from either point of view (good/bad). If you like it, good for you. If you don't, likewise. You really would have to ask the person who enjoys it what gives them "kicks" about it.    If I was to take a guess why the "value" for this is so high, then I would perhaps say that it has something to do with primal domination. There is something "dominating" about it.    I personally find this kind of disrespectful (to women). But that's just a highly opinionated answer - and I'm sure many will "disagree" with what is simply my personal belief (no, I'm not religious).|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Women will probably never understand how awesome getting oral from a woman is (as a man).    It's just really good, and that's an understatement.  My woman does an amazing job at it, too.  And talk about easy cleanup.  There's practically none (swallowing is a must).    I imagine if a guy did it right to you, you'd love it as well.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	It feels good and you don't have to worry about pleasuring your partner.

Yes, sometimes men may be so annoying trying to convince you that giving oral is the norm now days.  =P YUK!    Edit:  Thanks Mel - I was begining to think he was right, at least, most of the women in here seem to think there is nothing wrong with sucking on a man's thingy.  Ewwwwwwwww YUK!|`|FL67UPPHaa	A high value is placed on it precisely because they like it and it feels good, and in today's society people are in pursuit of pleasure above all else. Sex in general is greatly overrated.    I do find it slightly degrading as well. I suppose it's the woman's choice to do it, but unlike sex, women can get no physical pleasure from the act. They just do it to please their man. And it must be unhygienic...|`|rD5HyZyeaa	Why does our culture place a high value on oral sex? I don't know that I can speak for all cultures based upon my dating experience, but what the heck, I will anyway. I've dated many ethnicities of men (American, Middle Eastern, Indian, Asian) and while I would say that all men want/enjoy a ********, American men do seem to EXPECT it more than others. In my sexcapades, the guy will want at least some oral attention before intercourse, lest he gets off before it gets to that point - every time - while the guy may or may not go down on me. Oral sex on a woman is like a "treat," while oral sex for the man seems to be a regular thing. I love my boyfriend and do get passionate and excited and enjoy watching him squirm while I suck on him - I want to put that out there because I think it is important to do something only if you are comfortable with it. On the other hand, it sometimes annoys me that men expect it everytime. And when you don't give it to them they are likely to roll over and give you the silent treatment.    You can hate on me if you want, but I think men are much more sexually selfish than women are, and a ******** is a good example of this. If an man wants something in bed and doesn't get it, the attitude I see is often one of entitlement ("you are supposed to please me", "you know there are women out there who will do this for me, so if you're not going to then I'm not going to waste my time") Men are expected to get off every time whereas women are expected to enjoy the ride, whether or not they orgasm. I'm not saying men don't enjoy getting their partner off, but my experience is that the man puts himself first. And expects it to be this way.|`|K4zsztkRaa	>.    We just like it.  Is that okay?    Why do you spend so much time getting ready every morning, why do you have to spend tons' of money on makeup?    I love oral sex, I think it's wonderful. I also love giving it, it's great pleasing my partner and watching their reactions.  There is nothing wrong with that it's just something a majority of us enjoy and just because women don't feel the same way about it doesn't mean that we are wrong about it or we should feel as if we should be ashamed.    I just like having fun and getting pleasure from my partner, there is nothing wrong with that.    If feels good. Also men have a much higher sex drive so we enjoy those activities more.    -Connor|`|AAgX0SDcaa	porn|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Cause some men like it ?

If you are comfortable with someone it is rather great. You have been conditioned to think it is nasty    EDIT: If someone has a different opinion from me, thats fine, but on this issue women are universally conditioned since childhood to regard the activities of sex as being dirty and something a nice girl wouldn't do. I know. I received the same education. I don't understand how a heterosexual woman, if she was really passionately attracted to her partner would not find oral a very sexy turn on. If your lover is more of a friend then you might find it degrading. If your lover is physically repulsive you might find it degrading. But in any case the problem isn't the oral, but the man you are with. I am willing to believe lots of women settle for men who are more of the friend then the lover type and so naturally are disgusted by the act. They are with the wrong man.     Don't you think it is natural for a man to desire a woman that adores his body, in every sense? I want my man to love every part of me. If a man doesn't find the vagina attractive for example it is a huge turn off to me. It is so proper. Sex isn't proper. It is primal and I expect my man to be primal. I am comfortable in my sexuality as a woman. That's all. I have explored that side of me.|`|6mC3mp87aa	I am as clueless as you are. I think its really degrading.

Not only do I place a high value on recieving it, I place a high value in giving it.|`|Xa4Ov1Haaa	I think a high value is placed on it by many men for several reasons: 1.) It is very pleasurable- even more so than intercourse for some men because they are getting all the attention and don't have to do any tiresome movement. So it's their foremost sexual interest even above intercourse. 2.) It's sort of a power issue. Having a woman go down on them and please them is like having the woman be submissive and subservient to the man (probably from some men's points of view). Some men are into that idea. 3.) A lot of rap songs put a huge emphasis on receiving oral sex. It's no secret that popular music has a huge influence over a lot of people. So if a famous rapper releases songs with lyrics that glorify oral sex, it's inevitable that a million young men are going to think, "I gotta be into getting oral sex", just like they think "I gotta have shiny rims on my car" after they see rappers doing it.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	It's just a sexual act that feels good to some men.

You have to get away from spending all your time on line and find some friends away from the screen.  I know that sounds like a gross oversimplification, but you also know it yourself.    Find something that you want to do that will force you to be away from the computer (hiking, biking, dancing, anything).    But, you don't want to try and live to fulfill someone else's wishes.  I felt the same way in high school, and managed to overcome the feelings by establishing friendships with people who liked to go to movies, go fishing, go camping, ride motorcycles etc.  The main thing is to not worry about where you are in your present life, just start figuring out what you want to do, plan how to get there and quit dwelling on feeling sad or lonely.  None of the worry helps, only activity and input from other people will help you understand what is going on.
AA12398775	Well, there is soooooo much to be answered here, but if you are doing this for an assignment or something, the best place to start is by looking at an indigenous tribe of which there is a lot of literature and research about and which has a long history and look for example through there to give you some ideas.  Of course it only happens through contact with the "larger societies" if you can say... there must be a specific term for it...    I normally get the impression that Religions follow strict rules and are traditional... that they don't take well to change, however, religion may or may not have been used for power (depending on your personal views) for example in the fall of the Aztec groups I think it was... where there were examples of Catholicism being forced and used punishingly onto the population... their view/excuse may have been that they have to "save" these people and it is their duty by God to teach the "nonbelievers".  uuummm..... ohh but also you can see that in Guatemala or Mexico... or many other coutnries probably too :p  that Christianity has been mixed with elements of traditional culture... and that in some cases christian colonisers allowed certain festivals or celebrations to be kept.  Also take a look at the history of Santera practises and beliefs in Cuba I think, which was a way of disguising the Yoruba's Orishas so christians thought it was christian saints which were being prayed to etc...  but not meaning to patronise u, do your research carefully cause some resources portray orisha/santeria as a practise purely for negative vundun.... and also because I am just writing from the top of my head so what i might be telling could be rubbish :p|`|fd1ca97678efbda5438c859bb7cfdfccaa	fear and shame|`|fPjctyq3aa	The beliefs and skill sets of a majority always put a kind of peer presure on any minority within it, or a minority placed within it, such as groups that come to become part of a new whole. You saw that with colonialism, but it also happens like when tribes regain footings after having been surpressed almost out of existance. One of the impacts people often to not notice is major changes to the over all can do the opposite of causing a minority to digress from their long established ways of life. Pressure can cause exactly the opposite. A good example of that is the way the Jewish culture, though often changing over the centuries into differing denominations now, has often reacted by returning to it's old customs with what some might almost call a vengence. In the USA, what was almost erradicated of Indigenous groups, has in many of those same tribes, now returned, and ever so strong! The same is true of movments all over the world for types of Christianity trying to return to how it was practiced originally, regardless of the fact that very little exists to show what that was. What records do exist of it are studied extremely extensively, not just of beliefs but how to live them out as a faith of a sect of Judaism (as Christianity was.)  The more pressure put on a group to conform to the ever varying flavor of current flavors in gender expectations, of minimums in education, accepted scientific truths, and minimums of technological competancy, can and do cause smaller groups (and individuals) to have to decide what to accept and/or reject. A kind of polarization results. Sometimes to the point of forcing whole migrations so that they will not lose their now chosen ways. Again, the Jews, Gypsies, and many nomadic tribes show us this one. Adaption may manifest itself in exactly not what we expected.
NWwKrrC3aa	I understand what you are saying and agree to some degree.I understand that people feed their depression with sad music and depressing books instead of comedies and bright happy songs. But you can also look at it in a way that its just a way to be self indulgent, and then rid of the sad feelings, its not that we want to feel more sad and forever be depressed, but just not do things that would be innapropraite to the mood.

Ask him, because if this is the case, he'll expect you to sort out the problems of your co-worker. Your boss obviously knows about her short comings, but needs to concentrate on his patients.  In order to support you in this task I would ask him to have a serious talk to your colleague to point out then problems she is causing.  Maybe you and your boss could discuss different  tasks for your colleague to minimize major mistakes.    You might also want to consider that your colleague is under a lot of pressure and emotional distress. She knows she makes a lot of mistakes and she probably knows (or senses) that she is not welcome.  That would make her very insecure and prone to more mistakes, especially at her age.  Maybe it would help to be emotionally supportive to her and her work ethics might improve.    The only other option you have is to look for another clinic.. However, as you seem to enjoy working where you are now I would keep this as the very last resort.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	get in your bosses face and start demanding that you are doing more than your share and you deserve a raise...

ReH5EoR0aa	Women were still expected to stay home and have babies, take care of their man and serve others with nothing expected in return.  This was right after the Victorian era.       Amelia's parents didn't force her to think that way.  Her father covered for her and her mom let her be a tomboy like she wanted.    She was a leader type.      So, when she grew up and saw that girls her age and younger were still not doing what they should in life - say here's a smart girl who loves to work on cars.  But she's not allowed to and is forced to stay inside and sew.  That would be torture for her!  Or a guy who liked cooking and he was forced to go work construction.  He'd hate it.       Amelia wanted to fly planes and she did what was necessary to learn and actually do it.   Luckily she looked good and had a good personality, got along with people, spoke up how she felt - and she became known for going out and doing what she wanted instead of getting married and having a bunch of babies.       Other girls saw this - now this was during the roaring 20's and girls started cutting off their long hair - oh, this was a terrible thing for the grandmothers to see.  They never would have done such a thing - and the girls started wearing short skirts and dancing!   It caused quite an upset with the older crowd.   I mean, women had just started voting!     Amelia wasn't on the forefront of all this but she supported it with words and daring deeds.   These old ladies were getting it from all sides.     Now the young girls could say "look at Amelia - she didn't get corrupted by doing what she wants and not marrying.  She cut her hair - so it's ok now"     Things like that.  She was an example of doing to other women rather than telling them what to do.    She also cared a lot about people and spoke up for women to support them, was a poet and a writer.      She was lucky to find a husband who was willing to support her ideas and her work.  That helped too.   He wasn't some macho control freak wanting the little woman home all day.   He wasn't the most congenial man but he did do a lot of good that people don't realize.      Anyway, there is a little something to start with.

Amelia Earhart was an inspiration because she entered a field, aviation, that was mostly men. Every flying record accomplished (before her) had been done by men and she wanted to break the mold by saying, girls can do anything boys can do! Unfortunately, we will never be able to know what happened to her.

A lot of girls come on here saying they had dreams of him and hope  someone ways it means they are his dream girl or something.  You have to accept the dream and live on.

Now remember, Nick is a person too and please realize that doesn't his love grow on trees and that just anyone can have it.  I know Nick will find his perfect girl.  One he has always dreamed of.

8VDoimSLaa	wow...same here.  'cept i'm quite happy being intro-extro...  just think that you have the best of both.  Intro's I think forge more very deep bonds with those close to them compared to extro's who have more friends and may or may not have the time to get to know someone in a deeper level.  Your extro side means you are not too shy and you are actually capable of making friends, and that you can get people to trust you, which will benefit you in turn.    I think you are right about the self-confidence thing. Although its not easy, simply treating yourself better is a good way to start. I envy you so much because you are tall. I am the shortest in my class and juniors always suspect me to be "one of them" and those who look older treat me like crap. But hey, look on the bright side. At least you're not me. You know, maybe you'll turn into a supermodel someday in the future. A person like me would never get a chance at that.

Some guys just like to brag.  It makes them feel important to have the biggest and the best.  It doesn't mean they're insecure.  It just means they're a show-off.  It's the same principle as some people buying the biggest house in the fanciest neighborhood, or a woman wearing designer fashions when she can actually only afford Walmart.  In other words, playing high on the hog is a form of self-glorification and enhancement.  Insecurity may play a small part in it initially, but, but it feeds to one of the basic human desires to be envied and admired.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	It's just another Freudian theory about phallic symbols, like James Bond's large guns and men that drive large cars.|`|S3kV78fGaa	i don't think i've ever thought about that. probably some guys do it because they're insecure, and some guys probably just really like that stuff.
73oX7qcBaa	I was abused by my dad, verbally and physically as well and now am 29 years old....I live on my own now and since have forgave my dad, although at times it is hard to ignore my memories...I try to tell myself that I am a great person and to ignore everything my dad did because it was not accurate....  I think your mom is calling you dysfunctional because she is trying to pass the buck and pretend there is nothing wrong with her...    I am shy and it was hard for me to make friends when I first went out on my own but my advice is to force yourself to talk to people, I mean what is the worst that could happen...This worked for me...    I think you should finish school and get out of there.  In the mean time be strong, force yourself to do things you wouldn't normally do and positive self talk can make you feel better about yourself and if you feel good about you a lot of other things will get better....

8R2UMbNHaa	You my dear are not a sociopath.  Just by reading your question I can see that you have feelings and the fact that you care that you may be hurting someone by your actions proves that.  Not everyone that lies is a sociopath, they are cold calculated manipulators that use people to get what they want and don't care who they hurt in the process.  It sounds like you are confused and conflicted, I would suggest talking to a close friend or perhaps a therapist about this.  You are human so yes there will be mistakes, the important thing here is that you want to change for the better.  That is the first part of taking responsibility for yourself, good for you!  You are being pretty hard on yourself I would try to look at some sites that can help you improve on building your self esteem.  You are worth it!|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i can't imagine why you would think you were one. you are not and i k now you are glad ot hear that. its horribel to be one and they have no consicience at all they could care lessa bout anything or anyone and they can kill and wlak away fine.|`|wXWjPbizaa	No, you're not a sociopath.

So no, you're not a sociopath.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	No, you show obvious attachment and empathy for people and other human beings.    One of the basic signs of a sociopath or someone with another personality disorder is that they hurt animals.    You, however, seem to do the opposite.    Psychosomatic diseases can also apply to mental disorders, and you may want to watch out and forget about all this sociopath nonsense.|`|kqXQA2ILaa	watch Girl Interupted.

CxoogGzxaa	The spinning technique is a well known technique for staying in a lucid dream. You can also try to rub your hands together. But your best chance is to try to avoid the adrenaline rush that wakes you up (I assume that this adrenaline rush is happening because you get excited about finding yourself in a lucid dream?). You will want to try to shift your focus away from the adrenaline rush which you are expecting to have because it has always happened before so far. Rather, try focusing on your hands, rubbing them together, and/or focus on your dreamscape.     You can't be stuck forever in a lucid dream like in the movie Waking Life, because you will naturally wake up when you have had enough sleep. Also, when your REM sleep cycle that you are in while lucid dreaming comes to an end, your lucid dream will end with it. You can't come to physical harm by keeping yourself in your lucid dream.|`|AEZ0CpZnaa	acknowledge it is merely a dream|`|q5eRJTD1aa	Unfortunately for many people, instead of providing an outlet for unlimited fantasy and delight, dreams can be dreaded episodes of limitless terror. lucid dreaming may well be the basis of the most effective therapy for nightmares. If you know you are dreaming, it is a simple logical step to realising that nothing in your current experience, however unpleasant, can cause you physical harm. There is no need to run from or fight with dream monsters. In fact, it is often pointless to try, because the horror pursuing you was conceived in your own mind, and as long as you continue to fear it, it can pursue you wherever you dream yourself to be. The only way to really "escape" is to end your fear. The fear you feel in a nightmare is completely real; it is the danger that is not.     Unreasonable fear can be defused by facing up to the source, or going through with the frightening activity, so that you observe that no harm comes to you. In a nightmare, this act of courage can take any form that involves facing the "threat" rather than avoiding it.  Monsters often transform into benign creatures, friends, or empty shells when courageously confronted in lucid dreams. This is an extremely empowering experience. It teaches you in a very visceral manner that you can conquer fear and thereby become stronger.|`|QtPgt2J6aa	Lucid as in aware or you in control?    Using any method or technique to keep yourself asleep in such dreams could be potentially dangerous I assume. What if you loose control and you stay in sleep mode?    It has been a long time since I gave this sort of thing any thought, I would advise caution though.|`|hlOqDkj6aa	I have lucid dreams too. When I feel myself waking up and I don't want to in the dream I force myself to close my eyes. I find makes me stay asleep a little while longer.     When we dream the images pass through our minds so quickly a few seconds in reality could be an hour in a dream so even if this gives you a little while longer you'll dream a lot more.
mCAWxobNaa	Feminism benefits only those women who subscribe to this doctrine.  It only hurts those who fails to subscribe to it.

I'm not up on what feminists are doing right now.    My belief is in what feminism was originally, if it's changed since then, I'm not aware of it and can't support it since I have no clue what they're striving for.    Personally, as far as women's rights, I think we're done here and now as responsible women with power, we need to work to see these same rights available to all women.    I have other interests/beliefs, but we're talking feminism here so I'm focusing on women =o)|`|anLdtPQwaa	Benefits everyone. Equal choice, equal respect, equal everything.

They actually fight against equality when it benefits men OR may be detrimental to women.    For example, fathers rights were labelled as wife & child abusers - for daring to ask for equality. (now.org)    Feminists in British Parliament want women's prisons closed - and converted to men's prisons, despite the rise in female offenders of violent crimes. (Harriet Harman).    Feminists in British Parliament also want innocent men to be charged with rape when they engage the services of prostitutes. (Jacqui Smith)    Feminists have admitted their primary goal is to 'transfer money from wallet to handbag'. (Polly Toynbee)    Feminists want the president of USA to abandon fatherhood programmes - but demand cash for women only programmes. (now.org)        etc. etc. etc.    ETA: Yes, you're right - HH wants companies to give *preference* to women over men.

Following your logic, I want to know how that has helped me as a white female?    Oh, It didn't.    But, it made America more tolerable to those who were oppressed, and paved the way for a better democracy.     It enabled people to be socially free from forced repression, and laws were relinquished that were constructed to hold an outdated and counter-productive status quo.    Feminism has done that same thing.     Oh, and in terms of "modern" feminism helping others... hmm lets see. I live in California, and it takes two incomes to make a mortgage payment here. So, I guess that helps the economy, children in the home, lenders, and the husband (who can not do it alone).|`|62ZBofvPaa	-Feminism is attempting to liberate you from gender roles, so you can either follow them if you feel like it or not, it also means women don't have to worry about gender roles.  Your daughters and sisters will be able to go out on their own, and you'll be able to meet with women and have sex without worrying that you ruined her for marriage for life.  Just a few examples.    -Feminism is the whole reason why fathers can stay at home in the first place, actually...    -Um, no, feminism doesn't say "how to be a good feminist".  Feminism is a political, social and sexual movement, it has no will of its own and therefore is unable to tell anyone anything...only people can tell you x, y or z....    EDIT:  If you don't think the right to vote is modern, you need to go take a history class.  Goddamn.  Oh, by the way, the modern era started with the printing press, for ***** sake.      And what does girls whining about SAHDs or girls getting more affirmation have to do with feminism?  Let alone feminism doggedly pursing goals with no care of the consequences?

Feminism is still needed because everyone is still discriminated against which is horrible but true, black, red, white, purple, male or female you will be judged. Thats why i dont understand why people care so much about explaining feminism. It was a movement to help woman reach equality anyone remember black panthers???     You know i have never said we should stop male activists even though there are a few bad apples like that damn website men hate women or whatever it is called! I have never thrown quotes from The Male Supremacy Homepage where a man blabs on about how and why women should never be given any power because i realise that is not the case with all male activists. I am all for power for fathers and i believe they should be given equal rights just as a woman should and that is why male activists and feminists are still needed but we should ban together instead of trying to be superior to each other AHHHH all of this is so childish!    EDIT    Really good answer Izzi!!|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	Modern feminism doesn't benefit anyone else.

fDGPbwdsaa	They DO claim their movement is to attain fairness between the sexes.    It is the *actions* feminism that begs to differ from their *claims*.    If they were at least honest in their claims (i.e. they acknowledged they are only interested in gaining rights for women - and rights over men) THEN I would have a little more respect, for their honesty. At this time, however, they tend to insult people's intelligence by lying to their face.|`|anLdtPQwaa	I'm a feminist, and I respect myself. I don't claim it's equality when suited.

Equal = everyone gets the same  Fair = everyone gets what they need    You can't have both in most situations and most of the time feminism demands one or the other depending on which would benefit women.
F3nlVXJ5aa	it depends on who exactly you're asking about.  Say that you're asking about your parents, well these days with the poor economy they probably are thinking about the rent, insurance, car, food costs, and keeping a job or worrying about layoffs, so for them it may be a stress factor.  And if you're asking about teachers doing that well they may be afraid of losing their jobs.    if you're asking about grandparents then there is an age that people tend to forget things, or maybe some things aren't important to them so they forget.  Forgetting also could lend itself to losing a train of thought.  Also when people don't get out a lot or talk a lot their recall slips a bit or they can't remember a word that would fit to describe something.  For those older folks it could also be diet or lack of certain memory foods, or heredity could be a reason for alzheimers, however dementia is age related.|`|0s190C7Zaa	Could be but like much of anything in life it is not prove as of yet.|`|coogXEeeaa	I don't think there is any signifcant factors that cause this to happen.

Or when the Feminists run Congress?     WOW, for men, it'll be Hell On Earth.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	We have seen the effects of employing feminists into positions of power and influence. Harriet Harman wants women's prisons closed and converted into men's prisons, despite the rise in violent female offenders. Jacqui Smith wants innocent men labeled as rapists. Patricia Hewitt worked to keep more children away from their fathers.  And on the list goes.    So, given the historical view - putting feminists in positions of power demonstrates they WILL and DO abuse their power to the detriment of men.

It's purpose is to limit the power of government and if the authority is not in the Constitution, the government can't do it.

Or are you just starting now?    If you've always been quiet, then there's no point in trying to become louder.

This would be the "insecurity" part.    Honestly, there is nothing wrong with being quiet. But if you reaaaly want to talk so much, then just do it. Conversation starters are really simple, especially in class. Start with something basic, and if it's meant to be, you'll loosen up in no time.
f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Totally agree! I hate when my older family members complain about how I raise my kids, like not yelling at them for being curious, but at the same time we expect them to be at a human level, not an adult standard. I guess our home motto is although children are small humans, they are still human and should be treated with the same respect as every other human being!! And of course they are all about love, same way as a dog, by your side no matter what is done to them, until they lose that innocence and realize that a portion of the world is screwed in the head. We meet all their needs. never for once thinking they manipulate us!!

A newborn baby is not  'looking forward' to anything because it has no concept of time: except for the present.    Any 'love' felt is instinctive and essential for survival.

8d96fc38794a87c0f6833e25e261b668aa	You're looking at death like it's the end...like it's an event like in a horror movie, or something.      It's obvious your mom does not know what to say, how to help you and think that you'll eventually get over it. But your fear is literally sucking the energy out of you.  You make your body sick by this, and really there's no need what-so-ever.    Understand that death is a process, but not the end.  Your physical life comes to a close, but YOUR soul will always exist.  When you die, you go back to what was familiar prior to your birth.  It's home.  This here is only temporary...our lives here right now.  I have absolutely NO fear of death.  I will admit that ways leading up to the pearly gates can be pretty awful, but more people than not pass away without so much drama or horror.  Watching those tv shows about violence and also watching news about violence...that's what the news does. They report mostly the bad stuff.      Your life will take the course that is most on purpose.  If you worry so much about dying, you are wasting your time here by not living now.  Instead, you are creating so much tension in your body that you can get sick and attract illness.  So maybe it's time to just be present to your life right now and enjoy it.  Living here in body, on this planet offers so many good things.  Worrying about death is very pointless.|`|sCm9e4sEaa	I've had the same problem, I would completely flip out and start screaming and crying. It is just anxiety.

NDqjvkg7aa	Sure it's possible to think that people don't like you - but that's possible regardless of whether or not  you have insecurities with yourself.  But really, who cares?  Most people dislike someone and probably some people out there will dislike you.  When this happens, it's not always about you. Sometimes it's about the other person's issues,insecurities or preferences.  I think it's good to treat others how you want to be treated and don't say anything bad about anyone.  If you do these things, then if others don't like you, it's likely their problem and not a reflection on you.|`|V7OiaOvyaa	Well. That depends.

I have been an archaeologist for more than twenty years, and if I've ever worn khakis (and I can't recall doing so) it was because they were on sale at the second hand store where I buy my field clothes.    Also, when a young archaeologist makes the mistake of showing up on a project dressed like Indiana Jones, they are generally made fun of and never do it again.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	They don't show dirt much and they are out in the boonies.|`|956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	I don't actually own any khaki, for the field or outside of it.  Okay, I did have a khaki hat in school, but I haven't worn it since.  Most of us just wear whatever rugged, cheap clothes we come across.  Khaki's a good, light fabric, but I prefer jeans, which keep away the thorns better.  Army surplus stuff is a favorite, because, again, cheap and durable.  It's all Hollywood's fault.  I've never come across anyone who dresses like Indiana Jones or the paleontologists in _Jurassic Park_, but that's what everyone thinks we wear.  In reality, I keep saying that I really hope grunge comes back in style, because that means that, when I wear work clothes out, I'll be stylish instead of sloppy.

A strong black male is not going to bend under the weight of social ignorance and is immune to attempts by bigots and ignoramuses to belittle him.     He is aware of his People's history and is proud of his heritage.     He recognizes the challenges and injustice committed against his People and rises above the ashes of his fore fathers to do them proud with the great example he sets as a strong, capable, loving, intelligent and compassionate  human being.     He is not bogged down with a constant sense of bitter injustice but simultanioulsy stives constantly to ensure that positive change must and will be made for his People and society at large so that progress will occur and that history shall not repeat itself.    He does not succumb to the pitfalls presented to him and tenaciously overcomes any slights cast before him. He rises to the top physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually and sets a good example for all.     He is brimming with a strong sense of morals and honor in his personal life, in his family life, in the workplace and is an intergral and vital part of Society.    He commands respect, he deserves respect and he GETS it.

An idiot father in the UK named his child after every member of his favourite football team, that does not make his wife a feminist, just another woman with not enough sense to stand up to a stupid man and protect her child from ridicule.

iyyvbHHnaa	My initial reaction: "high school"  :D    1) Teachers are morons that settled for their job. Most of the time, they don't even get to use their university education (with the exception of that stupid little teacher's college). My tutors often prove my teachers wrong, especially high school physics, because teachers do not have smart enough brain to do physics (they end up making up weird solutions that are wrong...but they never realize, sucks).    2) School limits creativity and discourages gifted students from doing well. Teachers demand that everything gets done in their way. If you don't show steps/do the question in a certain way/my ***, you don't get full mark even though your answer is perfectly right. In my case, I used to have difficulty describing how I solved a certain problem because I never studied much. Most of the times, I came up with a solution on the spot, but I would not know how to explain. I ended up losing tons of marks.    3) Teachers are arrogant. They do some stupid bureaucratic **** and feel good about themselves because they think they're being "professional". They don't realize that all the formalities are counter-productive, unless your goal is to create robots that fit nicely in a cubicle.    Hope this helped.  Mostly it's my personal rant.

TBsVmUoCaa	To answer your question: it's extremely hard, if not impossible to move back to gold standard. There simply isn't enough Au.    If there was enough gold, I still don't think it's a good idea because "there are disadvantages to the gold standard. One of the main disadvantages of implementation is that a gold standard would artificially inflate gold's value, increasing the cost of items and industrial process in which it is used. Another disadvantage is under the gold standard, gold mined at a different rate than the economy grows can produce both inflation, when deposits are discovered and extracted and deflation when they are mined to exhaustion."|`|awuGFzOPaa	You have it backwards, the price of gold would be priced much higher, as it should be. Governments have artificially held the gold price down for decades now. It should be around $5,000 an once, not $900.    I believe we will have to do something like that soon. With the spending government is about to do it will cause hyperinflation and collapse the dollar. Government will either have to introduce a new currency or back it by gold. Already China and Russia announced they will not be buying any more of our long term debt. They are already tired of our government devaluing the dollar with inflation.    We are all already cash poor, the dollar is worth less and less. The talking heads are worried about deflation, but the only thing going down is housing. Food is still up and most durable goods are too. The Fed increased the money supply in October by 70%! They are just warming up the printing presses according to the spending bill Congress is putting together. We will see hyperinflation in 1 to 2 years.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Don't listen to these people. Moving back to Gold is easy. All the government has to do is issue a decree that says:    "All outstanding dollars (ie: $10/Trillion) are a fraction thereof of our Gold Reserves of 8,133.5/Tonnes (286,900,769 Ounces)."     That would mean 1/ounce of Gold equals about $34,855.     From there each dollar that exists would represent some fraction of gold. The problem you would have down the road is that the money supply would no longer be flexible. The Federal Reserve (aka: Central Bank) would no longer exist. Overall, with a growing population, you would eventually have a deflation problem.     In any case, going back to gold is the easy party. Dealing with the economic impact is another story.|`|2206b0281b88485f9098f66c3af6eff9aa	What David says is true. It's a good idea, but there is not enough gold mined or on the market to back a large economy, let alone a lot of them. The Fed needs to be rethought because it is not even a govt' agency. You will never be without cash if you have gold or platinum, historically they have never had $0 value.|`|AA10719402	It would be PRETTY bad.      We are talking about a major contraction in money supply.    If you are asset (tangible) rich, then it shouldn't affect you much because you hold nothing that would actually be changed.  The price would fall, but the value of it relative to the rest of the economy would probably remain the same.    It's been tried before.  Churchill tried to go back to the gold standard after WWI and it failed horribly.  He later said it was the worst thing he did in his political career.    I know you sound very pro-gold standard, but what gives gold value as opposed to anything else?  Why is gold special in your mind?  Aside from that there are many problems with having a currency tied to gold.  It would most likely become more and more fractionally reserved until the amount of gold backing each dollar would be miniscule.

Assuming the price you can charge is fixed, you don't want to stop making and selling more goods where MC is decreasing b/c on the next item you make and sell, you'll be making an even greater profit.  You'll probably stop producing at a point where MC is increasing b/c at some point, the MC will increase to a point where it is equal to selling price of the good, where you don't make any additional profit.
X9RoKfWPaa	Well honey everyone has stress its a part of human emotion. You cant be happy all the time it just doesnt work you would eventually crack. The best way to talk to her if you feel bad is to just simply explain to her that you were moody yesterday and you didnt feel right. Stress can be caused by several things depending on how old you are. Trouble at home, problems at work, School tests and not releasing it can cause you to eventualy explode and be rash and be completely out of your norm.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	yeah it is stress,. you have to overcome it,,.. relax, tke everything easy,.. if it persists see a therapist,.. the talk therapy is the best solution to remove stress n relaxation methods like meditation, yoga etc..
tVvhbPLfaa	oh my sounds like me..I do half that. I think it's a strong deep care and/or love for this person. You are very emotionally attached and invested on some level.When you care deeply you go an extra mile for the ones you deeply  adore like doing anything for them. You have it bad  as Usher would say,  and I can tell that you fell hard for this man. Enjoy just make sure he gives back to you to sometimes. :-)|`|e6f0256206b1ea8c927abbd5ed521df9aa	Though it does sounds like a real love but i don't know for how long you will continue to think that way because most of us know each other only when we get close or live to gether.Problems does comes later.If you both get through all the difference between you have and continue to love each other and live together then yes I would call it real love.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	It could be real love, but with unhealthy boundaries.
LAuC27Ciaa	Hey since I saw your additional information I realized your life is definetly not easy, but to help make you feel any better my father and mother whom have been married for 20 years are constantly fighting I already know my father hates me and ive watched him constanly cheat on my mother and walk out on her many times, I hope you will learn that god forbid if things dont work out between your parents that you will be happy for them instead of trying to work and put the pieces back together ive tried that many times, id rather my parents get a divorce then to see them continue fighting (they fight at least once a week) Ive seen some tuff things and im sure you have too.... not only is my dad a deadbeat my sister is autistic and I feel like im practically invisible at times. Dont stress yourself out on this as I have for a few years too, I say my father hates me, well to be honest he might not hate me but he really does dislike me but no matter how much your or my dad might "hate" us theyll always have to deal with the fact that we are a part of them and they helped bring us in this world and no matter what they can't undo that :)    Hey Mikkey,  First off I'm not going to tell you to go to a therapist or anything you dont know how many times ive heard that btw, I cant say I know EXACTLY what your going through  but I know what its like to want to cry and not be able to let it out  Im 14 also, just remember your not alone and theres always someone worst than you,  And with the crying thing I normally tell people I dont cry well I barely cry anymore and they ask how come? I normally tell them I think Ive ran out of tears, I dont know if you understand what I meant by that but I mean Ive been through so much and im tired of crying... I think your tired of crying, I know theres many people (mostly adults) that might laugh and say whats a 14 year old girl doing depressed? But they dont know what its like and we may be young but we have to deal with crap. I know you might seem like your in a hard maze and theres no way out, but trust me there is... every problem ALWAYS has a solution and its not always easy definetly not but who ever said life was fair? with being scared and asking for help one thing you should never do NEVER EVER do is keep your feelings bottled inside, trust me it just makes you more stressed out you need to find a good loyal trustworthy friend and talk to him/her about what your going through it helps. Or even a really nice trustworthy adult, its always about the trust in the end. If you have parents that care, I didnt want to say it but you can talk to them... or someone, whenever i was stressed out I used to write in a little journal and keep it very private and write my deepest thoughts in there but unfortunately i think... someone in my house read it because i found it in my drawer and i dont keep it there so I later burned it.... XD but i hope i helped,  even if its just a little  keeeep rockn',  x- Britt.|`|AA10510845	This is something most young teenagers go through.

Don't walk around with self doubt. You did the right thing.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I agree, I think she was just playing you and using your friendship for her own agenda.  She just wanted to use you go get her family in the country, and probably get you to give her money and stuff.  I think it would be best to find new friends.  It doesn't sound like this girl really cares about anyone, and look at how many lies you have already caught her in, and just imagine the lies you haven't figured out yet.  I would find new friends, this girl could be more trouble than you could know.

Personally, after I was done jerking off and ******* my 'girlfriend' for a few days, I'd be pretty antsy to get back into my body.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	I think women would make far better men.  Mainly because this world has been built to make things as comfortable as possible for the men, and women have all become accustomed to that.  The other reason (assuming it only lasted a day or so) is because, and I apologise for the following frankness, the men would definitely want to experiment with their newfound sexuality.  The women probably would too, but they'd have found out all they needed to in the first 10 minutes and be free to get on with things.|`|QxSO5aNtaa	nooo cuz just because your outside changes doesn't mean your inside does so men would just be more sensitive and women would be more prick-ish.....blah blah so on so on.      you get it.      nothing changes but your sex i see where your going but this isnt that right way of putting the question.|`|ul79DG2kaa	Well women would briefly enjoy peeing standing up, quickly rub one out and get on with life.

SLOW DOWN.  close your eyes, picture yourself somewhere else, and walk away. get yourself out of the place you're at that's making you feel what you're feeling, and go close your eyes, put your mind somewhere else.    mind over matter.  so just slow yourself down.    good luck.|`|P0aay31daa	well if i feel like im going to cry, i take a deep breath and sometimes hold it or i go some ware where there isn't a lot of people and try to relax, if i cant go anywhere at that moment, i just clutch my teeth as hard as i can. if im mad, i take a couple deep breaths or scream in my pillow or punch my punching bag, i also write a letter about why im mad or about the person that im mad at and throw it away so nobody would see it.|`|dTEbLgvEaa	I wish I knew the long term answer to this question as I've always been a bit emotional.  I've learned a trick that works for the present moment though which I will share with you.  Sounds crazy but it works!    Roll your eyes - clockwise or counter - doesn't matter.  All you have to do is remember to do it.  Next time you feel like crying try it.      The other classic thing that helps is to hold your tongue - very hard to do sometimes.  I love this quote from Benjamin Franklin, "Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."|`|cIczdgqraa	Its called Critical Thinking. I  just  completed a class on behavior and this critical thinking was brought up plenty of times. This thinking is a thought process that, at the end, that gives you the best, most thought out, healthy result.         See, I have a problem sometime with my emotions and how I interpret what a lot of people are saying. One of the many reasons people get all "bent outta shape" is because they tend to carry other people's "baggage". And what I mean by this is if there is someone or something that stresses you out and dumps their problems on you---you need to put an end to that and take control of YOUR life. Filter out all the garbage in you life: the drama, bad company, etc, etc. This was my big problem---making other people's problems my problem.        This is where critical thinking kicks in: Look and listen to the situation. You need to really listen to it and figure out whether or not what you're hearing is even worth your time. If it is then make sure you know ALL the facts before coming to a conclusion. Don't react on something that isn't factual or based on something you heard from the horses mouth yourself. Then, you'll better be able to make a better decision as to what you want to do about it. Know the consequenses also and know that every word or action, whether you apologies or not, will leave a scar.        Another thing is this: don't over analyze what people say. If someone says to you that your haircut looks nice, that it's better than last time, what do you do? Do you take it as a compliment or say, so you're saying that my hair was messed up last time? Do you look at the negative or positive? Do you recognize the tiny black speck on the big piece of paper? or do you see the big white paper with the small speck?  My point is: if anyone with emotional issues (as myself) wants to better themselves they need to look at things in a positive perspective and force yourself, at times, to see the positives in things.  If you have an issue, the worst thing you can do is let it build up, cause believe me, it's coming out one way or another.        If things are that bad there are always youth groups, stress and anger management groups, or maybe just a simply yoga class or some "down" time can really help. TALK, TALK, TALK, about issues can really help out.        I could go on and on about this, but I hope this little bit helps at least lead you in the right direction.        I have the book that I read: I'll give you the Title and Author as soon as I get home.|`|HqS6TiiQaa	well you can only control yourself and your emotions, you can start with communication & tell this other person how you feel.|`|nHD8nQTRaa	Take a deep breath and count to ten.

zeu9ftogaa	I know that the thing on the person's back represents "carpetbaggers"  who were the people who moved from the north to impose the rules of the north onto the south.  The term wasn't meant to be nice, and kind of insinuated that they were moving into the south to take power for themselves and get rich off of the new government programs.  The person with the bag on her back says "The Solid South".  I think that it's saying that carpetbaggers and "bayonet rule" are harming the solid south.  Bayonet Rule refers to the military presence of the US army in the south during reconstruction, the men walking next to the bag are probably US soldiers.  And the Solid South usually refers to the Democratic/White domination of politics in the south after the Civil War.    The Other side of the cartoon shows the "Carpet Bag" being buried.  So maybe US Grant's policies changed in his second term, ending the strong Northern/Republican influence in the south that was present during the Reconstruction Period.    I'm not entirely sure which point of view the cartoon is coming from.  I think probably pro-south because the "Solid South" woman is majestic and being "oppressed" by Grant. and in the Right side the background shows a nice productive scene after the Carpet bag is dead.    hopefully this helps.

I'm not saying it's not a real problem, but it IS temporary. What you're thinking about is permanent. There is nothing wrong with you. At all. You're a good person. Sometimes, life is hard and people are cruel. Unfortunately, it's a fact of life. But it will get better. I can empathize with you because I had a similar upbringing. Parents were problem drinkers, a girlfriend whose parents didn't like me, fairly non-athletic, and was beaten up. A lot. I got through with books and music and knowing, deep down inside, I was better than my surroundings and would escape someday. You have to believe me on this. Suicide is not romantic, you will not see your parents/tormenters/friends crying over you. You will be gone and, eventually, they will move on. You have so many things ahead of you that are positive. Don't let the negatives that you're facing destroy you. Become stronger than they are by overcoming this.

AA10510845	Start at the beginning.  Tell how dreams affect your own life.  Age has nothing to do with remembering your dreams.  Most dreams, unless they are scary or vivid, escape our memories as soon as we wake up.  Dreams are manifestations of our subconscious mind, and usually they take a form that's actually symbolic of our thoughts and feelings when  we're awake.  In other words, you can dream about falling off a cliff, when in reality, you may be afraid of failing an exam.  Or you can dream about losing your teeth, when what you're actually afraid of losing is a friend.  Do you understand what I'm trying to say?  These are just a few thoughts about dreams that might help you to put your psychology project into perspective.  You can further expound on the mechanisms of dreams.  Do some research on them, ask about dreams your friends or family members have had.  Dreams are a fascinating subject, and you should be able to find out a lot about them.  So you can start out at any point and go from there.  Good luck!
33l3blvsaa	hun you need to either start being more open with your counciler or get a new one.    its realy important talking to someone but you need to tell them everything in order to move on.|`|4317accfe03568bc79308d15d6913a82aa	You are depressed and having the death of a parent would certainly lead to it, specially if you didn't have the right "tools" to help you cope and deal with your loss.    It's first important to recognize that there is no limitation on how long it takes a person to grieve; so be kind to yourself and give yourself as much time as you need.  But also, give yourself the room that if you do want to do something nice for yourself during this time, that this is completely acceptable too.    Having worked through a severe depression and being depression (and medication free for 7 years), I do know a thing or two.  I've never cut myself, but have done reading and know that the underlying "need" is personal control.  Meaning, people who cut do it because they feel that other parts of their lives are being controlled by others (parent, bf/gf, etc) and by cutting it is the one thing they can control.  When they do it, where on their body, how much and how frequently.  The important thing to recognize is that it doesn't really solve any problems; just causes scarring and is self destructive.    And as for drugs... did quite a bit of LSD as a teen; mushrooms too.. and smoked green daily for 10 to 15 years.  Too much cess does depress!  Getting high only distracts from dealing with our feelings; which can be scary.    I recommend contacting your family doctor and talking to them.  Anti-depressant medication can be taken to help you start to feel better.  Once your brain starts to feel better, you can then start to learn the tools you need to overcome and get better.    Your family doctor can refer you to mental health classes offered through your local hospital; if you're in Canada, this might be covered by OHIP.    Take my advice and be your own best friend.  You've been hurting long enough and know that your father would want you to have a healthy youth and develop into a healthy man.  No one and nothing can ever take away from the years you spent.  And no amount of time can ever make them disappear.    You don't have to forget him; just find a balance that you can get better, move a head and take care of yourself in the long run.    God Bless!
vAdtlZDpaa	I am not sure what you mean by apparition - you mean like a ghost?    Ghosts are representative of something that is no longer obtainable or within reach. It indicates that you are feeling disconnected from life and society. Try to figure out what the ghosts wants or what it is looking for. Alternatively, the dream may be a calling for you to move on and abandon your outdated modes of thinking and behavior.    Do you know what the six digit number was, or do you just know that it a was a six-digit number?    Specific numbers in dreams are meaningful. To see numbers in your dream symbolize material gains and possessions. Numbers also carry much personal significance. They may represent a special date, address, age, or something meaningful and significant to only you.|`|qJtPcrWTaa	time to play the lotto lol|`|DaZ2RdBcaa	hiya,    numbers in dreams are rarely messages that wil help you win the lottery (damn unfortunate aint it? lol) but they can reveal where your focus currently lies. the numbers may be related to your birth date, or even an address where you used to live. a number that you consider 'lucky' will be a message to follow through with a plan you have in mind, a number that is 'unlucky' for you may be taken as a warning.    hope this helps :) Leah

7fa0FWu2aa	1) Background to the topic: Intelligence has been studied for over one hundred years.    2) Include the work of Binet, who first started testing school, to identify underachievers.  His work led to the 11plus exam (to see whether children should go to a grammar school or a comprehensive school).    3) Include the work of Francis Galton, who developed 'THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CURVE.'    4) Is there a single thing called intelligence?    5) Then talk about nomothetic research: which is about finding general principles and comparing people with one another.  This relates to 'THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION.'    6) Talk about multiple intelligences: different people have a number of different skills.    Conclusion.

AA10471548	Expectations  This I find to be true, our expectations may highly influence what we experience. However, not only negative expectations may form our reality, also positive ones. The more it is important to be and stay positive not matter what (often easier said than done).    Many years ago Prentice Mulford had a little book published on positive thinking. It was a shortened edition of the regular book, a palm-size little book, full of amazing wisdom.    I found several of her books on Amazon, however, not the little palm-sized one. May be you like to look into one or the other of these books.    On the Internet I discovered the following article; it seems similar to the one you are looking for:    Great Expectations?  Oct 7, 2006 ... We all live with an unconscious expectation of ourselves and our own lives. This expectation not only determines what we have in our lives ...  http://www.articlesbase.com/self-help-ar...    Thoughts are powers. Wishing you to manifest the very best.

Everything in moderation.      When a person is selfish they seek to gain or aquire for themselves through various means with a disregard to others.    While on the flip side to be selfLESS   is looked at as a positive attribute, but in reality it is not.     To break down the translation= Self- LESS.  You cannot act up to your full potential or capacity in life, without having your self intact.  When a persons energy is expended in all directions other than oneself, it leaves them worn out, and unable to be of any real assistance to others; which is ironic because that is their goal.      "Volunteers need both selfish and selfless motives to sustain their interest" (Natalie de Combray).     That is a quote you might use.      Anyway, keep going, it is a good and valid topic and I like where it's headed. :)|`|2hl89HUeaa	Yes it is alright to be selfish from time to time.  Self indulgence is necessary from time to time to maintain self esteem,Inner peace,a positive outlook,and attitude.      Those who are too selfish are usually the most unhappy, frustrated people with low self esteem. But rather than a balance of selflessness and self indulgence. They get tied up in the what about ME. Whats in it for ME. Then they are outwardly unpleasant and disagreeable towards others. This leads to minor delusions of grandeur. Very few if any real friendships or deep relationships. Spending more and more time alone. With no one to Gage behavior or attitude against. Communication skills suffer and loneliness becomes a burden masked by a false sense of well being and a continued masquerade in public. Yes it is frustrating on both sides of this conundrum and the answer is directly in front of us but because we are either the purveyor or the purveyee the presence of the problem makes us blind to it.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Absolutely!   How's this for a scenario -   You have a good friend who is a drama queen and loves to gossip. You've trusted said friend with secrets before, and they say they love you to death, but the next day everyone knows your secret and is now constantly harassing you over said secret.     Even though this friend claims to love you and would be lost without you, they haven't changed despite the fact they've hurt you over this gossip habit.     Would you stay in that situation because you don't want to hurt their feelings, or would you move on in that situation because you don't want to be hurt anymore?   I'd call that a "need to be selfish" situation.     Another good situation would be -   You get a job offering in another state. It's your dream job, the one  you've been after all your life. However, this means you'll be leaving loved ones behind. But, you've spent your whole life working towards this goal and the opportunity to have it won't come along again. Your close loved family will go the extra distance to help keep the relationship intact - the others, maybe not.     I'd call that a "need to be selfish" situation.     Or what about a married couple, but one abuses the other? And you have kids who keep witnessing the abuse?     That's a "need to be selfish" situation - actually, a need to "move out so I don't get killed" situation. Or a "move out so I don't get killed and my kids don't get hurt" situation.|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	yes it is. You SHOULD be concerned about your own self interests.|`|Xl28pRORaa	Yes. You should love yourself . Sometimes it had to depend what kind of situation that you have to be selfish.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	yeah u have to be selfish sometimes, n look from your eyes only... it is a normal thing, wen u feel bad, u have to take care of yourself etc.. first..|`|z9OmCLRoaa	Maybe you can approach it from the "survival" point of view.   Say that as humans/animals we are designed to survive and make decisions to keep us safe and alive.   Have you heard that when a driver is having a car crass they'll almost always swerve to protect their own life. This person could be Mother Teresa.     Maybe change the wording a bit.      Instead of saying it's okay for someone to act "selfishly" say that it's okay for someone to act in their own "self-interest".     Johnny may move away from his girlfriend and family to pursue his career. Is that kind of selfishness okay? I'd say yes.  Get where I'm going?    Good luck with your speech! =)|`|hpzfccwaaa	When it comes time for your life to end here on earth you will want to hold on to that bay pole for as long as you can but the drift of deaths current weakens your hold and the ties of fellowship and family are soon loosened by the strong current of death pulling at you from your life and one day you will not be selfish to hold on but in love you will release them and be on your way along a different path and to a new place you will know as home.

44435ac38b755e42d6164067b0413d71aa	Dream interpretations always have to be based in a personal context.  You need to think about what happened to you, why the ring might be showing up now, and what the stones mean.  Have you recently found something?  Has something changed in your marriage? Are you thinking of having a baby?  Is there some potential risk to you and your husband that you're worrying about?      I also would point out that even though what happened in the dream was upsetting, your husband and you were working together to try to find them  That seems to suggest that you and your husband are close and work as a team.    I suggest that you spend a little time pondering what the dream might mean.  Perhaps something will suggest itself to you, and you'll realize what the underlying meaning is.      Sherozzel|`|fmr98EBtaa	I personally don't understand why there is a forum on here dedicated to dream interpretation. Everyone seems to believe that dreams have a "secret meaning". The truth is, they don't. Despite the beliefs of Freud, (which are no longer commonly accepted by psychologists) dreams do not hold much if any weight. If you want to make a big deal out of it, go ahead, but I would say that it doesn't mean anything.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	To receive diamond jewelry in your dream signifies love. To dream that you lose a ring represents insecurity. Perhaps you are losing interest in some relationship or issue. To  see slippers in your dream also suggests feeling insecure. You feel that you do not have a strong foothold in some situation. This dream symbol may mean that you need to relax.     To see diamonds in your dream signifies the wholeness of the Self. A ring is a symbol of  emotional wholeness, continuity and commitments. Since the diamonds were falling out of your ring, you may feel that your emotional health is not as good as it should be, or that you have lost some vital part of yourself.    Blue represents truth, wisdom, heaven, eternity, devotion, tranquility, loyalty and openness. Perhaps you are expressing a desire to get away. The presence of this color in your dream, may symbolize your spiritual guide and your optimism of the future. You have clarity of mind. Depending on the context of your dream, the color blue may also be a  metaphor of "being blue" and feeling sad.    To see a square in your dream denotes your need for more stability. It may also represent strength and solidity.     When you feel emotions in your dreams, that indicates that the emotion has been repressed in waking life. Since you and your husband were both upset in the dream, you have probably been upset by something in your waking life connected to your insecurities, but have not expressed it.     To dream that you are searching for something signifies the need to find something that is missing or needed in your life. You may be searching for love, spiritual enlightenment, peace or even a solution to a problem.

jWjf7ndeaa	Hi - I can tell by your question you must be in High School, and you are probably a girl.  Many young girls cry at the drop of a hat - especially around family members.  Why?  Perhaps it is because you feel safer showing your true feelings at home than you do at school.  When you get frustrated at school you may not want to appear weak in front of friends, but while at home you can just be yourself.  Does that make sense?  Mom's can especially be an emotional trigger because kids generally have a strong emotional connections to parents - even if their parents drive them crazy! (and vice-versa).  This is why parents and kids can sometimes "push each other's buttons" and get strong emotions out of each other that non-family members just can't, except when maybe you're in love with someone.    Don't worry too much about your emotions going whack a few times a week - especially if you're a teenager.  There are lots of physical and emotional (and hormonal) changes going on in your teens, and all of that can be a bit overwhelming and confusing for you.  Especially girls and women.  When someone is in puberty or menopause (45 years +) hormonal changes can make a woman seem like she's on an emotional roller coaster she can't control.      I hope this helped a bit - school can be very stressful - the key is just to believe in yourself and have confidence.  You're not going to get everything perfect in school or in life, but just do the best you can and be satisfied with that.    Peace.|`|AA10510845	You're probably super sensitive.  Deep down, you want to please everyone, and when that doesn't happen, you get frustrated. Crying is one way to release that frustration.  Well, just realize that no one is perfect.  We all make mistakes and have disappointments.  Crying will not change those situations.  What you need to do is just try harder the next time, and roll with the punches.  No one really expects you to be perfect, so go easy on yourself.  Good luck!|`|8d96fc38794a87c0f6833e25e261b668aa	You have sensitive feelings, and you take things very personally.  When you cry, do you have a strong sense of shame?  Take a look at what that shame really is, and unravel that.  Seeing yourself as acceptable and also HUMAN will make it easier when you receive Impact from people.  But you probably really have high expectations of yourself that is beyond what you can really obtain.

BbC1w6Diaa	1. Technically, yes, but there's no point in making yourself love someone.  2. Platonic is basically that.

chlGzFQlaa	I think I'm currently going throught the hardest phase I've ever been through. I migrated to another country almost a year ago, and the sudden change culturally shocked me so bad that I created my own little shell and I now preside in it. My introversion is like a disease and yet it has opened my eyes to more intriguing things, it haunts me, and at the same time promises me of a future compensation. I die a little every day on those days when I go to school and I don't talk to a single person. I have a lot of those. I hope it will get over, and in order for my hope to one day become reality, I must now believe that it will pass in order to set my mind to overcome this either slowly or randomly.    And right now, I'm stuck in between a power struggle between my idiotic elder brother and my mother. I'm some sideshow in every aspect of my life. I miss my dad, I don't see him as much as I want to. I miss my friends from back home, remembering peace in the homes of my best friends. I'm living through some sadistic hidden chapter of Dante's, if I don't get out, well, it has been a nice ride.     Oh, and I feel that i'm currently walking on Holden's path, and I'm wondering about how to avoid the same fall that Holden missed.    I wish my grandpa would've known me before he died. I wish my other set of grandparents gain the ability to see me and not see a shadow of anybody else.

Also while I can never confirm it, I could've sworn there were a bunch of people trying to kill me those years, and this year. lol race issues.    Did I get over it? No.    Why? Too much scarring, man. That's like asking a guy who's just been stabbed through the heart if he's going to make it D;|`|bhc7HuN9aa	The death of my father & mother.  Got over it because of time.|`|SIaDlb8waa	My mom passing away when i was in fifth grade, then my grandpa passing away 2 weeks later, a week before Christmas. Later finding out that my dad also has cancer but a different kind that my mom died from.     Yes i eventually got through it but it was difficult.  I still miss them more than ever, but I'm getting through it.
BEe6jwNXaa	Yes, but it depends on having certain circumstances.  If no resources are allocated yet and you are talking about assigning resources in a manner that is Pareto optimal a corner solution only works if both individuals indifference curves a straight lines cutting through the corners.      If resources are already allocated and you are trying to reallocate them in a way that is Pareto efficient, as long as both of the individuals are not already on an indifference curve which is beyond the corner solution it could be done.
wgZVeLZPaa	Wow - that's tough. Well, you could do what I did a long time ago - I got an apartment across the street from where I worked and walked every day. Either that or use public transportation (if you can).     But I'd try to find a job ASAP. That's the only way you are going to get out.|`|iF92Q2f3aa	There are too many cars on the road anyway. My sons and I bicycle and use public transport.     However, I am also encouraging them to get their driving licenses because I think that in a motorised society it is important to have the skill, and to be legally able to use it. Your mother's position strikes me as highly irrational. She is probably a serious control freak.     What about getting into a car pool with someone from work or school? You could put up a note in both places saying something like "please help me get my btw practice while commuting, will share fuel costs." Or something like that.     There's got to be a creative and affordable way to work some practice into your schedule; if that's too hard, well... moving out is sort of staring you in the face, isn't it?    Good luck!    edit- I just realised that this question really belongs more in Transport. But it does make a nice change from some of the free-floating hostility in this category! :)|`|hYohgOcAaa	go to college even if community  get a job  than start supporting urself  this is basically what everyone does|`|s3IBrhZCaa	if you can afford it.....move out. thats the only answer i can give you.|`|oCHaJc49aa	We're approaching the end of the age of the car. It had a beginning; it will have an end. If you look up a concept called "Peak Oil" you'll find out what I mean.     Your mother, who sounds like the proverbial control freak, may be accidentally right. I'm not sure too many will be driving a car in the mid-term future.     This is of little help to yourself, of course, but you may want to think about "alternative" transport. If you don't live too far from where you're going, a bicycle might help.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Just do what I did: buy a car without your parents permission, leave it somewhere other than your house (maybe at your friends or something), practice driving by yourself - go early in the morning if you're afraid of getting caught by police officers, get a license, go back to your parents house and explain everything.|`|2Yh2elrhaa	Because ur a grown women and u need to be on your own maybe if u went to college or tried gettin a job to support ur self she would helpl becuse she knows ur trying.and maybe ur mom just wants u to learn to be independent instead of dependin on her all the time she isnt always gonna be there and ur 20 somethin so u need to do it by ur self becuse if yo mom wont help u u cant just give up cuz ur mommy wont spoil u. u have 2 get up and be a women okay not to be rude im just tell da truth okay i hope i helped      im only 14 but i know wat im talking about|`|PNwr3JgBaa	I go to college and I fully support myself. I am not even 20 yet. GROW UP!!!|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	Take driver's ed. to get your license and then move out.  If you need roommates, so be it.  Clearly nothing is being accomplished in your mother's house, so you should get out of there.  And there's really nothing wrong with someone in her early 20s still being at home while in college.  My brother is 21 and still lives at home.  It saves money.|`|c77cjTOeaa	You don't need her permission or help.    If you want a driver's license then get one.  I don't understand why this is such a big problem for you.    Put up a card at your local grocery store, Craig's List, etc.,  asking for "Help Wanted, Driver Training Instructor" or "Driving Instructor".
nc1whD2Daa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|BbC1w6Diaa	I hate to bring you down, but there are a lot of people out there like that. People who don't want to be with anyone who isn't of their race. The type who probably would've gone out with that cute black guy had he not been black.    Do you exercise daily, because that's always a big self esteem builder.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	The best thing u can do is find a club or some kinda association. U can join it in order to meet ppl like urself.   As for the girl, its not that big of a deal reely. I mean she is a girl, its normal that she might have felt uncomfortable. I mean, even I am like that when I see a white guy come talk to me outta nowhere.  Yeah, so try to join some clubs, etc. Join a gym..  Good luck in skool!
9D08eHn7aa	Without going to the site I'll tell you that the Real i is long and the N i is short.  Why?  The real interest rate is what you really are worried about and the N i is the short term rate because you can tell what you are going to pay by the Real.  To get the R i you subtract the inflation rate from the N i.  So if you borrow money and the expected inflation rate is actually higher than the lender thought then you are paying less for the money you borrowed and vice versa.    The Nominal is higher than the Real and there have been cases where there is a negative Real.
7h5zhoJqaa	Rambunctious, it mustn't be stopped. What must be stopped is our 20+ year, multi-trillion dollar effort attempting to stop it.  It will never be stopped because the profit margin is too high for law enforcement to ever have significant impact on the business of smugglers.  Enforcement is increased, more shipments are caught, and the smugglers just send in even more shipments to ensure that the appropriate amount of product gets through.  There will also always be users, as it's too easy to find drugs, and much too compelling for those who choose to use.    What we need to do is quit trying to tell people what they can and can't use and legalize ALL of it.  Alcohol is one of the most dangerous recreational drugs available.  It's insane that it is legal but we make it a crime to use any other drugs.    Legalization would have the excellent side effect of ending the billion dollar illicit industry that currently sits in the hands of our worst domestic & foreign enemies - gangs, cartels and terrorist networks.  Instead, it would employ honest, hardworking Americans through a legal drug industry.  Tax revenues could be used to pay for rehabilitation and INFORMED drug education instead of the program of myths and lies that we currently call drug prevention.  And, of course, law enforcement would be freed up to work on problems that can be helped and enforce laws that aren't just out there to keep people from harming themselves.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Drug Trafficking is like any other business. The only problem is that Governments don't like it and you need to keep the operation on the down-low.     The pros is that you make crazy money because people are addicted to your product.     The cons, you can end up dead or in jail.     As for the drug that makes the most money, that depends on the market at the time. Since California allows people to grow weed, imported weed sales are down and the weed growers in Mexico and elsewhere are hurting.  Whereas chemicals in making Meth are in short supply. As such, the supply cant meet the demand and prices are high.|`|EVDh4emTaa	No pros!! People are used so stupid drug dealers can make money -illegally!It is stupid, dangerous and must be stopped!!
kKPFlDZ2aa	The answer is A. The brain evolves just as other organs do. Infact, if you look at the structure of the brain, the areas of the brain that control our most basic functions, those that have been with us for millions of years (emotions, motor skills, vegetative functions), are located deep within the brain stem. However, the relatively newer abilities (language, fine motor skills, planning) are located in the outer portions of the brain, called the neocortex or new cortex. This is true for animals as well (they do not have language but the brain evolves with the species) Hope this helped.
q802CQnAaa	Yes, people ar encouraged relentlessly by the media to buy, buy, buy. That you NEED this or that and have to keep buying the "latest" and "greatest". Models of gizmos and gadgets started out lasting a decade or two until companies found that marketing can be very lucrative and models are now rolled out every 2 years or so and people just buy them up (even when the original is operational). Thus relentless buying has become the norm over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, this is also what all of our economic indicators are based on, instead of what the true level is. We're probably near to reaching what that level should be. Not yet, but close.|`|QAtpLEEFaa	For the most insightful  answer about how our current consumerist culture developed see this BBC series: 'the Century of Self'    In brief it shows how one of Freuds nephews became a brilliant marketing man  by tapping into  our deepest anxieties and desires and then using advertising and  other marketing strategies to encourage us all to make our major 'self' a  consuming self'  He led the 'fight' to change 20th century people into those who only define themselves as someone who buys 'the latest thing' ie   always 'needing to need'.    So,  in a direct answer to your question: it  the social norm of 'needing to need ' or of feeling comfortable only if we have the very newest of the new products on themarket.     However, it's also important to see how these norms are historically constructed.    ps how comfortable do  you feel when you have an out of date mobile phone, computer system. hair style,etc    We have to have particularly strong personalities to be able to resist this compulsion to 'update' everything.  As for me I cant wait for my birthday when my kids are buying me a 'Blackberry'|`|ec6b4fb07cc60e9ae7bef47000091ab4aa	We've evolved from an industrial nation making goods, to a consumer nation, buying goods. The social norm to buy, is an illusion propagated by the media and is actually a form of brainwashing. Coupled with substandard education (dumbing down America) and subliminal marketing techniques, and those not aware will feel the need to buy. A study of basic and more advanced psychological Marketing should open your eyes and probably upset you as well.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	the more crap you have... the more important you are... as long as it is new with a label on it.
TcISytjqaa	Its the people you hang with why are they being such d!cks just chill and asked them to stop in a nice firm way. :) to freak out to muck k.
yLY8B4scaa	Psychoanalysis. there is probabaly something else too.|`|HsCHz0kyaa	I believe your answer would be sociology.  However, there are more specific areas that I might not know about, but the plaid out answer is Sociology.  I might be spelling it wrong though, so.  Best of Luck.
