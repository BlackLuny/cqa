14zk9dldaa	I understand your feeling! However, there are a few tips that can help.<br>  <br>  I am the queen of "lets get it done cause I don't wanna do it but know I have to" Therefore, I've tried several different ways and have found this will GET IT DONE MUCH QUICKER! <br>  <br>  I'll explain step by step, sorry for the legnth but try it and I'm sure you'll see what I mean.<br>  <br>  1. Use fabric softener (Dollar store/cheaper). Makes em smell good but more importantly, gives you less wrinkles and takes out that static cling.<br>  <br>  2.This one takes a bit longer, (in the front end, but in the long run it can save time) shake your clothes as you're putting them into the dryer.<br>  <br>  If you just throw them in, it takes much longer for the clothes to "untwist"  in the dryer. <br>  <br>  Doing so, allows them to dry faster b/c the air can get to them easier.<br>  <br>  This also allows the clothes to come out less wrinkled.<br>  <br>  2. You're going to begin by seperating them right away as your're pulling your clothes out of your basket. <br>  <br>  Start by just pulling only tee shirts out, give each one a good shake and lay it out flat unfolded on the (bed couch where ever you're doing it). <br>  <br>  Stack each of one on top of each other. You can also do this with your slacks and jeans.<br>  <br>  With these set aside, continue on with your socks and underware folding them and stacking them.<br>  (this I've found really empties that basket really quick) <br>  makes me happy la la la!<br>  <br>  Once your finished with the socks & underware put them in your drawers. (put yer drawls in your drawers lol) (little joke there).<br>  <br>  Next get your hangers (I ususally count how many I'll need so I won't be running back and forth to get hangers).<br>  <br>  Start with the top tee shirt (Don't pick it up, leave it flat out and stacked w/ the others).<br>  <br>  Place the hanger on the first tee shirt.<br>  <br>  Flip it down without picking it up, then put the next hanger on the second tee shirt and flip it down onto the first tee and so on. Then you can pick em all up in one swoop and hang em!<br>  <br>  Hanging tee's are a lot quicker than folding them.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to give yourself a time limit for gettin em outta the basket.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to beat your time, it will help put some pep in your step (so to speak).<br>  <br>  Also, THINK about this laundry thing...when you're taking off your clothes before putting them into the hamper make sure the are not insideout. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. If you try it let me know how it worked for ya!|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I do not understand why you hate it.  All you have to do is load the washer and walk away.  When you come back in an hour just toss in the dryer and toss another load in.  Then you can walk away and do something else or go somewhere.  For me the only bad part about laundry is folding and taking care of.  Laundry is really one of the easiest jobs there is.  You could always load your laundry up and take to laundry mat and be done with it in just a couple of hours.|`|YUq2kwxJaa	I didnt before but now I do.. I live in an apartment complex where there are no washer dryer hook ups and its driving me crazy because I wash for me and my husband and our son so its never ending.<br>  My husband is kind enough to take our clothes once a week to the super sized washers and dryers so I separate everything into darks and lights and towels (we have lots) and he uses 2 big washers, 1 small washer and 3 big dryers to wash our clothes.

w3KDePAeaa	Whatever you do DO NOT listen to rich! Lowe's sells in the plumbing specialty tools section, a disposal wrench, Not the bottom wrench but one that goes into the mouth of the actual disposal. You will have to physically turn the "teeth"to free the jam.  The wrench has a tee handle and a pretty funky looking head (sort of in a horse shoe shape). The head of the wrench is on a swivel which allows you to "spin" the head into the mouth of the disposal. If you need to call a plumber don't be too proud because if you listen to idiots like rich, you'll end up buying another disposal and then have to pay a plumber to put it in for you when they could have gotten it out of a jam in 15 mins or so. Please don't think in the caveman mentality! "something not work, bang with stick!"|`|AA11988604	Use the broom/plunger handle, but don't bang it anywhere, use it to try to turn the blades, sort of like stirring a giant pot of something.|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Take a broom handle (power off on the disposal) and put the handle end in the disposal and give a couple of sharp raps downward.

woq2l8lYaa	From what I'd read in my email from one of those DIY sites:  frugal at about.com or something like that (of course I can't find it now) once it is dried it is going to stay.  That is the purpose of paint, that it can not be washed off.  Recommended answer:  cutting out the carpet and place a new remnant there.|`|oZsYtB0Paa	Follow these steps carefully to remove the Paint, Latex Dried spill:<br>  Act Quickly! Delaying may cause the spill to become a permanent stain. Blot liquids with a dry, white absorbent cloth or white paper towels. Gently scrape up semi-solids with a rounded spoon. Break up solids and vacuum.<br>  <br>  Pretest any spot removal solution (for color transfer to the cloth or damage to the carpet) in an inconspicuous area. If a change occurs, select another solution. <br>  <br>  <br>  Apply a small amount of the solution to a white cloth, and work in gently - do not rub -- working from the edges of the spill to the center to prevent spreading. Allow to remain on the spill a few minutes. Be patient. Blot. <br>  <br>  <br>  Continue to use the first agent as long as there is a transfer of the spill to the cloth. Be patient. Complete removal may require repeating the same step several times. Or, you may need to move to the next solution. <br>  <br>  <br>  When the spill is completely removed, rinse the area with cold water; blot with a dry cloth until all moisture is removed. <br>  A dry, absorbent, cleaning compound may be used as a substitute to minimize drying time.<br>  <br>  <br>   Detergent Solution - Mix one fourth (1/4) teaspoon of a liquid dishwashing detergent per one (1) cup of lukewarm water. NEVER USE A STRONGER CONCENTRATION! Thorough rinsing is necessary to remove detergent residues that may cause rapid soiling. It may be necessary to rinse with warm water several times to completely remove residues. (See Residue Precautions.) Care should be used in selecting a detergent. Never use a laundry detergent of any type, because laundry detergents may contain optical brighteners (flourescent dyes) that dye the fiber. Do not select an automatic dishwashing detergent because many contain bleaching agents that destroy dyes and some fibers. <br>  <br>   Warm Water - Lukewarm tap water should be used in most cases to rinse the cleaning solutions from the fiber. Failure to completely rinse the solutions from the fiber may cause accelerated soiling. <br>  <br>   Spot Removal Kit - Available from most carpet retail stores. Follow directions closely! Some spot removal kits contain: (A) a detergent solution and (B) a stain-resist solution. Use of the (B) solution prior to the complete removal of the spill may cause a permanent stain. Other spot removal kits may contain a dry extraction cleaning compound that can be used effectively for most common household stains. <br>  <br>   Ammonia Solution - Mix one (1) tablespoon of household ammonia per cup of water. Please note: Be aware that ammonia, if used improperly, can cause a color change. Be sure to test a hidden area. <br>  <br>   Call a Professional - Professional cleaners have the ability and the equipment to use more aggressive cleaning solutions to remove stubborn spills. Always consider consulting a professional cleaner regarding any spot removal question. CRI - 1-800-882-8846 <br>  <br>  <br>  Residue Precautions<br>  Many spot removal solutions leave residues in the carpet that may attract soil. Thoroughly rinse the area several times with lukewarm tap water. A mist type sprayer is recommended to prevent overwetting. Blot with paper towels and pat dry after each rinse. Several rinses are often necessary to thoroughly remove residues. Never use any of the solutions in concentrations stronger than those recommended.|`|c9C0RdAYaa	Ya goof off works great....|`|SJFuMUbSaa	Goo Off works pretty well.  What kind of paint latex or oil based?<br>  <br>  Latex comes off pretty well with goofoff, or whatever it is called.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you try the remover in a spot that no one will see to see if it will damage your carpet.

Z0hgioE8aa	If you cut the potato into quarters and suspend it in a glass of water by sticking a toothpick in either side until it gets a good root system on it.  Then transplant it into a pot with potting soil until the plant is about six inches tall.  Then transplant into your garden where the soil has been tilled or turned.|`|FOTAWffuaa	Yes it depends what size they are and whether they have young roots or shoots as they'll start to grow straight after you've planted them into the ground (id recommend this time of the year) as they'll bloom in September.  Um, water all over ground and make sure you keep the area warm if its under cover or rotate (break the soil up) before you plant them!  hope this helps xx :D|`|bc2c20578f51c5d8576556ddbba6f0a2aa	yes if you have ever noticed if you forget you have a potato and come back a few weeks later the spots where the eyes are have probly started growing. you will see shoots coming up off them. <br>  that is regrowth.|`|ItpzEOFhaa	you can leave them in the dark to sprout then plant them outside|`|AA10063059	yes just plant in alarge pot or bucket and when they produce flowers they are ready to dig up|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Grocery store potatoes have been sprayed with a hormone that inhibits their growth. It is not absolute, however. If you thoroughly wash the potato then you can use it. If you have one that has sprouted, wash it and then go ahead with growing it.|`|944iJNAdaa	This is an excellent way to transfer potato vine diseases to your home garden soil, too, so use this idea with caution.  Most gardeners plant seed potatoes instead, because they're grown under conditions guaranteed and certified to be disease free.  Commercial potato producers, on the other hand, only treat for the diseases, and diseases are often present, since they tend to use the same fields every year.|`|AA10648704	You can grow them, but they might not grow to the same size as the originals.  Cut them in pieces, with at least one sprouted eye per piece--these are the roots.  Plant them with a mound of about 6" of dirt above them.  As they sprout, cover them again at least one more time (but not completely) with another 3-4" of dirt.  Check them occasionally to see whether they're large enough to harvest (if not, rebury them),  Like I said, they won't get as big, but you should have some passable potatoes.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Yes, you can plant those.  They need a loose soil and plenty of room for the tubers to develop under ground.  As they grow add straw or dry grass clippings over the ground so any shallow potato doesn't see sunlight.  As you probably know, the green part of a potato is not to be eaten!! The green comes from sunlight exposure.  <br>  <br>  Normally the potato is but into sections as multiple eyes will sprout on the potato.  The cut ends must be allowed to dry before planting to retard rot.  Just set them out on the counter a day or so until the cut end is dry.  <br>  <br>  Wait to plant until warm weather.  They don't like frost or freezing temps.  <br>  <br>  Sweet potatoes are a bit different.  There you must sprout the potato, the glass and water method above is good enough.  Then take cuttings from the developing vine and get roots on them....water will work but soil is better.  Once the weather is warm, plant these rooted plants out in the garden.|`|AA11403032	Yes you can plant them and they will grow.<br>  <br>  Once the plants start growing you need to build up the soil around the stems an inch or two, otherwise any potatoes close to the surface will be green.<br>  <br>  <br>  However you won't get a great crop off them.  Much better to buy actual 'seed potatoes' from a garden centre.  They will produce a good crop and home-grown will taste better than anything you buy in the supermarket.|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	Short answer yes but you will get a bigger crop if you buy proper seed potatoes .More expensive but more potatoes from less plants cheaper in the long run

I also recommend that you read and study those instructions a half dozen or so times, or until you FULLY understand them, BEFORE you even try to start the job.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest mistakes made by home imrovement novices is to try to do a job for which they are unprepared.
DL5vxzBHaa	It's possible that you need a replacement ignition device, or the one you have has become greasy.  Try wiping it gently with a damp cloth.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you can always light your oven with matches - then you can enjoy your pizza!!<br>  <br>  Extra info.....<br>  The spark ignition would be right at the back of the oven next to the burners.  Buy a small box of matches if you're worried about using a lighter, and don't turn the gas control right up high.  That way, it's unlikely to burn your hand.|`|p1YQTRCRaa	Does your oven have a digital timer?

Heat rises.  To keep heat in the basement you may have to get ceiling fans which will help in keeping the heat in the basement.  If you need a space heater you may have to purchase it yourself.  You could also go to the court house and tell them you would like a copy of the tenant/landlord guidelines.  This book will tell you what the landlord is responsible for and what the tenant is responsible for.  You  will find it very informative.|`|XHjaActxaa	I would go about like this:<br>  <br>  1. First tell him of the problem. (verbally but always in writing too)<br>  2. Wait until he/she suggests something.<br>  3. If nothing is done & the problem is still there or is he/she has done something & it is still the same, call him & tell him the problem is still the same. (in writing aswell)<br>  4. If he/she still does not correct it go to your local council & ask there for there help as you are not getting anywhere with your landlord.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS put it in writing as a verbal conversation can never be tracked. <br>  Give the landlord a fair chance to get things right. Remember he/she is only human too & needs some time to get things sorted for you.<br>  <br>  Other than that, suggestions mentioned already are sound.<br>  <br>  If things never get done, maybe as a last resort look for somewhere else to live & maybe avoid a basement flat in future.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	there are usually minimum temperatures a landlord has to maintain. They usually vary between day and night. They also vary depending where you live. So you should check what temperatures the landlord has to maintain with the city you live in.<br>  If the house is heated with hot water he might to have switch a pump on so the water circulates properly.|`|AA11988604	If your landlord doesn't respond to the problem, call the local building inspector to find out what local ordinances require.  The lease probably just says something about adequate heat, but the local building code enforcement people will have an interpretation of what is required.   The landlord can meet that in any manner acceptable by your local ordinance and the building code.
TSpH4Ygdaa	The closest I've come to regretting letting something go were some of my books, but a good friend gave me a wonderful tip.<br>  She told me to donate them to a library, then I could "visit" them.<br>  I kept the ones I was very passionate about, or that were very sentimental but after a couple of moves, hauling all those heavy books, <br>  I found I wasn't terribly sentimental anymore..haha<br>  Also, another great tip.. going through your clothes, keep a size up and a size down, everything else...buh-bye. By the time you lose (or gain) a considerable amount of weight, the styles will have changed anyway..<br>  By the time I got around to re-organizing and letting things go, it was more important that everything I did keep was something I loved or something that had purpose instead of having a museum of crap that was bogging me down...|`|XHjaActxaa	Short answer is NO!<br>  <br>  A friend had a really quick & simple way to sort through stuff:<br>  <br>  Have you used this in the past three months?<br>  <br>  If not get rid, if yes keep. <br>  <br>  This simple one question really helped me focus on what i wanted to keep & stuff that needed throwing away.<br>  <br>  Mainly used with clothes though!|`|xshrKvIRaa	The rule is, if you haven't touched it in six months, you don't need it! So following that rule-I would toss or give most my stuff to Goodwill. You might even try a garage sale or Craigs List for the bigger items.
AHJQfHx9aa	Try contacting the local university.  There is high probability that the Advertising/Marketing department sells stuff on Ebay as part of one of their courses.  This would be a good option for some of your more collectable items (some of the CDs and books among other things).<br>  <br>  You can try using that link I sent you the other night.  (That's what reminded me, got a call from our marketing department the next morning!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VPN1qhxhaa	you could but stuff up on ebay, buy and sell, free cycle, anything really. for the collectables maybe you could go to like specialists on those items and then sell them to people who really want them and will pay lots for them!|`|GRb1SLGvaa	are you serious ?|`|AA10635683	How far are you moving?  What about a u-haul trailer, or making more than one trip?|`|AA11656886	Craigslist. com better than ebay and local|`|kYgU8NHAaa	When I moved to where I live now, a family friend who deals in antiques and estates helped me out.  She knew how much to price things for, and we had a big sale (it was in the summer, so it was both inside and outside the house).  I would advise you to contact someone like this.  They'll usually charge a fee, though (most likely a percentage of the money earned from the sale).  The woman who helped me didn't, because she's a friend, but she did take some items that she personally collects.  Maybe you could work out something like that.  If you have something that's worth money, or would be if you had the time to find the right buyer, perhaps an antique dealer would be willing to take that item as payment for his or her services.<br>  <br>  These people don't always have sales in nice weather.  Sometimes people's elderly relatives pass away, for example, and it's necessary to completely clean out a house before selling it, which isn't always going to take place at a convenient time of year.  There are definitely people in this business who aren't honest about the value of your items.  But perhaps you could ask around and find someone trustworthy.<br>  <br>  Whether you do this on your own at a sale or through Craigslist, you can get rid of more stuff than you sell.  One method my friend used was to say, "Ok, so you're here to buy the refrigerator.  If you pay for that, you can also have the kitchen table for free or for a reduced price."  She made people walk out with more than they paid for, just to get rid of all the crap.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you in Arizona!|`|hcqNXUH5aa	You're moving from MN?!  I live in MN!  Yes, it is quite cold here... I see your dilemma...  A garage sale would be ideal but impossible.  <br>  <br>  How about on ad in the newspaper?  <br>  <br>  Or, how about ebay??  You could put your items on a short auction... seven days perhaps?<br>  <br>  Edit:  Have you tried selling your stuff to an antique or pawn shop?  A used bookstore may pay you for your books...<br>  <br>  Edit:  Used CD shops, such as Last Stop CD shop (it's a chain) pays for CDs, movies, video games...<br>  <br>  Edit:  AZ?

In these rough times they are short on donations and could use the extra help.<br>  <br>  ...and it's a tax write off: )|`|5d9034dca457ea37161d033c4b4a434eaa	Craigslist<br>  <br>  Or get a storage unit if the stuff is worth it to you.|`|ErGQOhjqaa	Craigslist and E-Bay both take time, which you apparently don't have.  Storage costs an arm and a leg.  You have already done the best thing in contacting the auction houses.  However, I would give them a call.  They are much more likely to deal with you on the phone.  The only other thing you might do is run a quick ad, and advise that you want to sell everything in one lot, and not one piece at a time.  You might attract some used merchandise dealers that way.  Just know they will be looking for a real bargain.  Good luck.|`|SDHmVDlNaa	I would advertise in the paper this week for an estate sale in house.  Mark everything you want to sell and have several of your friends help you if you can.  One person for each room and cover or move to one room what you don't' want to sell.  This way you can have your sale and still have it in the warmth.  Set up a chair by the door to prevent any shop lifting.  I know some people worry about that.  I would also call any second hand furniture dealers and let them know about it.  I have heard of one or two who came in before the sale and decided to buy all the furniture and hauled it off for you.  Anything left you donate to a charitable organization.  My church picks up for free any item of furniture even beds and mattresses for those who have none.  They get calls for help all the time.  Hope that helps.

yu9PHV4Maa	poisoning is always a possibility, but usually when an attic is baited for them they tend to die up there.  There really isn't a good squirrel poison and anything that they would get outside, would also have to be where the birds would feed on it so there would also be a noticeable bird kill.  Another possibility is a natural pathogen being spread from squirrel to squirrel, this is the problem with catching and releasing problem squirrels instead of putting them down.

AKrTZqbKaa	Keep this room vent open and try turning down the others. This will allow this radiator more steam before it condenses to water. What your getting is water hammer because the steam is fighting the water that is flowing back to the boiler. By giving this room the steam first might reduce the water hammer. Don't worry about explosions as it is only water and steam and noisy. Did you replace the vents with the adjusting valves? That was a good choice if you did. Try adjusting them to see what works.|`|evItC2KQaa	You have water in the steam line.Make sure all the traps are properly installed and working.
Mj5hmRQwaa	With a southern facing, well lit room, I would choose a "cool'' color in either the green or blue family .  Or, a neutral tan or beige.  Your room is already radiating heat.<br>   <br>  But, I would first make sure everything that is staying in or being introduced into the room is in place, i.e. all fabrics, artwork (to pull from) and the appropriate lighting. <br>  Any fabric can suggest at least three options for wall colors, each of which will produce a different feeling in the room. Once you identify the options your fabric offers, decide which one creates the mood you want to evoke -- cozy, calm, relaxed, energetic, playful?<br>  <br>  Consider other colorways in your home and try to repeat an accent color used elsewhere as your wall color. <br>  <br>  Do you want to wake up with a light and bright room? Choose less saturated colors, towards the top of the paint strip. Do you want to feel more cozy? Choose more saturated shades, something half way down on the color strip. Darker shades absorb light and also give the illusion that the walls advance.<br>  <br>  Choosing a blending neutral, something a couple of shades darker than your cream color, would minimize the fact that you have many windows.  Conversely, a contrasting color will accentuate them.  <br>  <br>  I hope I've enlightened you.  <br>  <br>  Take a look at this link which is yet another thing to consider.<br>  <a href="http://www.bhg.com/decorating/color/choosing/color-and-wood-tone/?page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhg.com/decorating/color/choo...</a>|`|CabAIf4Vaa	a red maybe but u might not want ur bedroom room red so nvm|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Cream coloured curtains are a great start..almost any colour will look great..you can go with a soft flowy colour like a blue, green or aqua that is just barely tinted with colour..or you can go with all out colour and go with turquoise, red (make sure it is a true red), brown, or tuscanny colours, a terricota red, deep yellow..you can go with a nice sage green...look around your house for some colour you like..on a plant, clothes, dishes, magazine..you can get a colour idea in lots of places..have fun.|`|omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together.

ZCltHQpzaa	Almost everywhere in the US there is a surplus of homes available, prices have dropped so low that it would be crazy to build something new.  It is a GREAT time to buy a pre existing home.  Interest rates are very low and home prices are rock bottom.  There is a huge supply of houses to pick from.  Existing houses can be a bargain since they usually include things that new house don't.  Things like landscaping, paved drives, multi-car garage, upgraded flooring, upgraded cabinets and appliances, washer and dryer...  When building a new house you should allow for about 15% cost overruns over the advertised price.  Most builders are advertising low prices to attract buyers but when you get to the details you will soon find that they are using the cheapest cabinets, flooring, carpet etc.  <br>  <br>  Existing house will have most of the kinks worked out.  With a new house you will always run into some problems during the first few years.  Just like a new car a new house value drops faster than an existing house.<br>  <br>  Unless you have lots of experiance and a loads of free time building it yourself is probably not a good idea.  Everything is really much harder than they make it look on TV and requires tools that are expensive.  You will make costly mistakes.  <br>  <br>  If you do have some free time and like to do work yourself you may want to consider a fixer-upper.  In this market you can make a very low offer for houses that need significant work.  Just make sure you do the math and figure out what the renovations will cost and make sure that the house is structually sound.|`|GTJf4FKRaa	in the economy in the united states at the moment, i wouldn't do anything drastic as to buy a home. I would see as building a house to be more costly then to buy a home that is already built since you would have to pay for the supplies to be delivered, windows, shutters, pipes. there is so much work to be done. I think you would be better off to pay for a home pre-built. Although buying a home now on the market price would be a good alternative route to take since many houses are in foreclosure and prices cut drasticallyly since the economy.|`|XHjaActxaa	That response is about right. To build a standard house you are talking about ￡150-￡200 per square foot. Remember at present though builders a re competing for work so you can get some really good deals.<br>  <br>  Obviously this figure can vary dramatically if you were to use cheaper/more expensive materials.|`|qKj9OhFZaa	With the house market today you should be able to buy cheaper than build unless you plan on performing some of the work yourself.

fNylbrJvaa	I have a similar situation, and I use an oil-filled radiator that plugs in. It has a digitally controlled thermostat, so you can set the temperature you want as well as read the actual room temperature. It also has three "speed" controls so you can set it to heat quickly (uses more energy) or slowly (more energy efficient). It is safe in that it is not going to catch anything on fire or release any fumes into the air; however, on higher settings it can be hot to the touch. Depending on the configuration of your space (i.e., is it one big open room, or divided, or are there large obstacles), I would recommend 1 heating unit for every 400 square feet of space, or thereabout. You can also get ceramic heaters with various options like oscillating fans, temperature controls, and auto shut off when tipped; however, the ones with fans are obviously going to make noise, while anything without a fan is going to be quiet. Since we are nearing winter's end, you should be able to find some clearance deals on either type of space heater at stores like Target or Home Depot.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	A small electric Ceramic heater would work well. We have one with a thermostat and two heat settings that works good. It is made by Holmes, but there are several different ones available. They are economical and safe and you can just leave them running and the heat will build up to whatever level you want.|`|nWFeh2ylaa	I prefer 220 electric baseboard heat.  It is more efficient than space heaters and more reliable.  The most basic of electrical knowledge is required.  Not sure what your layout is, but for a space of that size, you should need about 30 linear feet of baseboard spaced as evenly around the room as possible.  There will be a thermostat to install. <br>  <br>  Also, you can keep it at 60-62 degrees and then move it to 68-70 when you are going to use the area.  It will heat up the room quickly.  <br>  <br>  This is a dry form of heat, but basements do not usually need additional humidification.  If so, a decent sized humidifier would do plenty for this room.|`|5d9034dca457ea37161d033c4b4a434eaa	I would use electric base board heaters. They are easy to put in and out. Just plug them into the wall. And relatively efficient. Plus you can turn them on just when you're down there.
n560blqraa	Yes, I have a traditional raised ranch in my home that had the same problem of the black metal/iron staircase which desperately needed to get painted. I went out and bought 8 cans of rustoleum spray paint in finish of my choice. I used the hammer finish. These can be purchased at any Lowes or Home Depot Store.(paint section). I waited til a nice warm day (otherwise it will not dry quickly) I live in CT so it was done during summertime, instead of removing the railings, I took cardboard and held it against the backside to prevent spraying my carpeting, etc. Rustoleum makes two different types that will work for you. They have a hammered finish that looks like brushed nickel (used this one in my home) and they also have a matte nickel which also will work for you. (used the matte on a secondary property I owned) Make sure to hold the cardboard on opposite side when spraying and reverse order to hit opposite side again. Work in small increments and spray evenly, so shake can often so it does not clog up on you. Do not spray too close or you will get run marks. Spray at about 7" away from project to prevent build up, and spray left to right in longer strokes. Spray one side first, let dry and move to backside with same technique holding cardboard on opposite side to prevent over-spray. It's also a good idea to lay down plastic for overspray to protect carpeting as well, and open door to ventilate while doing this. Make sure to use large piece of carboard so you can spray rungs/stiles of railing in an up and down fashion also; keeping long strokes as well. Left to right  railing top, up and down for rungs/stiles of railing. You will also find a variety of different brands available at Lowes and Home Depot in brushed nickel or variant of these that will give you the same look as brushed nickel. This process/technique holds up beautifully to a lot of abuse by pets and kids and will not chip off. When you are ready to leave apartment, just do same technique as above and spray back to black. I changed the entire look of mine in under 2 hours. Easy to do DIY project. Simplicity at it's finest!|`|AA10502773	The fact that this is a rental, I suggest you get approval from the owner.  You don't want to get into war when it is time to leave.  IOW you don't want to purchase a replacement rail.  My other suggestion is don't improve someone else's property.  I learned the hard way. I didn't get in any trouble - I just don't have that money in my banking account either.  If the owner approved then I guess there are spray paints out there you could purchase but let me tell ya those paint can's don't go very far.|`|5d9034dca457ea37161d033c4b4a434eaa	Krylon and American Traditions have spray paints that would do the trick.

wj8FNY7Vaa	I am a carpenter and I built my own home (3,400 sq ft).  I (with my wifes limited help) did EVERYTHING except the flat cement work, digging the well, and putting in the septic system.  I also had someone finish off my driveway, (1,600 feet long) hauling in the gravel and spreading it.<br>  <br>  Most people that build their own homes subcontract most of the work out.  For the average person I  think that is the smartest way to go.  I am what I consider the exception to the rule.<br>  <br>  1)  you will have to subcontract some of the building of your home.  Some because the "state" will require a licenced person to perform certain things and some because you are not proficiant enough by yourself.<br>  <br>  2) recognize the amount of time it takes to build a home.  I took an entire year off and still that was not enough time.  5 years later my custom built (by me) cabinets don't have any doors on them (but the winter is not over yet).<br>  <br>  3) knowing when what needs to be done comes with knowledge and experience.  You must learn to think 5 steps down the road when you build.  In other words the correct order things need to be done and why.<br>  <br>  4) making sure you order your materials in a timely manor and don't scheadule people unless you know you will be ready for them.<br>  <br>  I had my brother and a friend of mine help me set the trusses with the help of a crane.<br>  <br>  Digging a foundation (renting a Backo) and pouring it are not as difficult as you might think.

I used PEX for all my supply plumbing and PVC drains.  Romex supplied my electrical needs.  If you are not profiecant with electricty I would not install your own service like I did.  I also installed my own outdoor furnance, not all that tought either.|`|flkVehA9aa	Good intelligence is fine, but you need experience and specific knowledge about each craft involved.  If you don't know what you are doing, you can waste a lot of money and end up with a crappy house.|`|Rn7Kjwdxaa	I built my own home about 20 yrs ago and it was quite an undertaking.  I was required to have a Licensed contractor oversee the work, though as far as I remember he never even stopped by.  It took me a year to build it and I had things like the grading, foundation, electrical, plumbing, cabinets, carpet and tile done by professionals.  When you get a construction loan you have to take out a loan for the price of the house in about 3 installments so if it's like a $150,000 house, you'll take out the first $50,000 and start the foundation and framework etc and you owe interest on that money from the day they give it to you and you're not able to switch over to a conventional loan until the house is completed so you could be looking at a great deal of money if you run into problems and you aren't able to finish the job in a timely manner.  You could be wayyyyyyy in over your head before you know it.  You'd better know what you're doing!|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	Are you wanting to General Contract or hammer in hand build it yourself?

I would set it up so you pay them a % off the cost or amount they save you .Just work it so you do the overseeing but they help get your subs in and out this will help with the cost.

You just can't get all the answers from Yahoo Answers and discussion boards. <br>  <br>  If you're looking to learn how to build, don't start by trying to build a house. And I'm a big believer in the DIY mindset so you know, but a house is going to put you over budget faster than you think. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend not doing it. Get a house with an unfinished basement or something that you can redo, Or try to get part time work with roofers/dry wall/plumbing/framers, etc so you can learn.

F4FCBEgzaa	Let it cool to "warm" before putting it in a zip lock style baggie. Then put it in a cardboard box, empty can or anything to protect it from getting poked and leaking in your garbage bag.|`|fNylbrJvaa	You're right; you're supposed to put it in a sealed container like a coffee can before disposing of it with your garbage. If the oil is cool, you could use a glass jar or a plastic yogurt container. If the oil is clean enough, you could try to reuse it... or filter it for reuse. Whatever you do, don't pour it down the drain. According to Wikipedia, a single litre of oil can contaminate as much as 1 million litres of water and can congeal on pipes provoking blockages... and nobody wants that! Some localities recycle used cooking oil, so you may want to check with public works in your area to see if that is a possibility.|`|UQWusO1waa	dump it in your yard.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	After it cools you can put it in a can or plastic bottle and see if your local service station will let you dump it in their oil recovery tank. I usually filter it and pour it into my home heating tank and let it mix to get burnt as heating oil. Can't do this if it was lard as that hardens when cool. Veggie oil remains fluid cold or hot and will mix and burn. Some people who have diesel engines use this to burn in the car and call it Bio/Diesel.
yu9PHV4Maa	having bugs inside many times is a numbers game...the more types of and population of insects around the house outside gives way to having bugs getting inside and with most of Florida being favorable for bug activity year round and insect breeding for most of the year you will have more insect issues than most parts of the US.

It isn't like Floridians really enjoy bugs but we "adapt" to the generous numbers and you could think of it as a type of training to get over any assumptions about which species is "dominant".  (Floridians can be brutal about teasing people-I remember being told that there were "clouds" of palmetto bugs that would engulf hapless victims and since I was new to the area--Umm, yikes?--I thought he was serious).  Florida is a buggy place, for sure, but it is only more noticeably buggy, and I mean buggy, in the summer.  I was just now looking around the internet trying to find a way to get rid of silverfish, which I now understand are harmless but that won't stop me from attempting to battle them out of my living space.  Bugs like humidity and I've notices that lots of bug, roach, and silverfish poisons seem to operate by dehydrating the critters so the secret to bug-freedom is to keep things dry and very clean--is my take on the bug dilemma.  Good luck!

n560blqraa	Not sure if you want us to talk about what our kitchens look like, or are you looking for some ideas? Well, I will tell you I had a typical raised ranch with a normal sized kitchen and dining room. My husband and I last year gutted the entire kitchen and dining room and took down the wall between them to put in a full Chef's gourmet kitchen equipped with pot filler, two separate sinks, granite counter-tops,wine fridge,and all commercial stainless steel appliances. We broke into a portion of our attic to make cathedral ceilings. We gutted everything ourselves and did the remodel ourselves entirely to save a ton of money. If we had contracted it out, it would have cost us over $100,000.00 kitchen remodel. We spent around $45,000.00 b/c we did it ourselves including installing high-end cabinetry. We only hired a company to do granite work. My husband and I also installed travertine flooring. The kitchen is now 25 Lx14 W, and we added a room off the back of the house 16x 16 dining room with cathedral ceilings. It tokk us 3 months to complete, but wow it is impressive and now we are enjoying it.

wHVx9HZVaa	I am not sure how small you mean by small but apple trees, even small ones need full sun and at least 8 feet between them. It may be better to plant two apples and one crab to pollinate if you don't have enough room for three. Whatever you do do not be tempted by the three  vareties grafted together on one plant. The amount they produce is pathetic and they tend to revert to the strongest grower.<br>  <br>  Good varieties to grow in your area are...<br>  Discovery, not the most amazing flavour out there (Quite sharp) but it is pretty early and lasts well once picked. <br>  Charles Ross is a good long season apple, quite sweet but with a tang to it.<br>  My third choice would be Egremont Russet as I love the nutty taste but I do realise that russets are not to everyones likings. This produces later in the season ripening from October through to December.<br>  For more information on good apple varieties to grow in you area try this wonderful site. <br>  <a href="http://www.orangepippin.com/varietyindex2.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.orangepippin.com/varietyindex...</a>|`|sw2R5A9iaa	since trees are such a big investment, visit the local nursery for help choosing the trees for your yard & zone.  they often offer a guarantee if they plant the trees.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Talk to someone at your local garden centre.

znFpsUTaaa	Try googling Mother Earth, not sure of actual URL address.  Or, use either google or yahoo with search words How to build storage sheds.<br>  <br>  As with other answer, you can usually find the materials and some very basic printout plans you would need by going to a big box home improvement center to the building materials department and looking for the Design It Yourself kiosk.  That is a computer that asks you what you want to do then guides you along its program.<br>  <br>  The Mother Earth thing is a holdover from the old days when you could buy the Mother Earth catalog, which was chock full of a wildly varying type of subjects and articles.  It was a valuable source of information back then.  Am not sure they still publish the catalog, but do think they may have converted to a magazine of sorts.  In any case, the site does have lots of testimonials and how to articles, you just have to search.<br>  <br>  Finally, your library reference section should have books you can check out that will do two things--first is show you all the various sheds you might like to try out then buy the plans, second are some books on actually how to do it and what materials you will need.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  BTW, Wikipedia does have similar material and you might find something there too.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	I am not positive but I thought you could purchase plans with a materials list at any of the big box building suppliers.  I am sure there are several web sites that will sell them to you.

wj8FNY7Vaa	You may be able to remove it with solvents and elbow grease, but you may end up damaging the laminate tops so be careful.   It is better to rub gently and longer with a very fine steel wool than to get the job done faster with a coarse grade.   They are several types of paint roomer I have used for small projects that have seemed to work and not damage the subsurface (Goof -off for one).  But for larger projects I have used paint stripper (Stripeze) but i do not know if this would damage laminate or not.  Test it on a small area first.  If it proves safe then you can go for it.<br>  <br>  If in the end you ruin your laminate, you and always put a new layer of laminate over the old even if it has a rolled edge.

I would call a local carpet professional and have them recommend a spotter with enzymes.<br>  <br>  And DO NOT use Oxyclean!

n560blqraa	Wow, yeah she has some stuff!!! LOL Okay, although I do this for a living. There is some things that would have made this easier, like where are all the doors and windows located in her room. So, without actually having the exact dimensions, I am going to try and give you some ideas and links to give you the visual. <br>  <br>  Here goes....the issue here is when you can't extend out, you go up!! What I mean is make sure you are utilizing your ceiling height to it's fullest. If you have a long uninterrupted wall...go to Home Depot or Lowes and purchase 2 separate base kitchen cabinets. Along an 8' the uninterrupted wall (without the doorway in it) place one base to the left and one base to the right.  <br>  <br>  Buy a laminate countertop that will extend over both of them,as in 8'ft piece. This now provides closed storage at the bottom of each cabinet base and the countertop becomes her desk. Buy two 36" base cabinets. Very affordable at only about $135.00 ea. or less. <br>  <br>  Buy them in clean pure white. At 36" ea. x 2= 72" the wall is 8 feet. 72'inches gives you 6 ft. along that wall of cabinetry. This leaves a 2ft opening underneath the countertop in the center for your daughters desk chair and remaining hidden storage under the built in desk. Above the base cabinetry (remember one at 36" left, one at 36" right) with a countertop (8ft) extending whole length of 8 ft.  Thid gives you striage behind closed doors for audio, video, and gaming equiptment.<br>  <br>  The start shelving going up wall at 11" above countertop, add shelving all the way up until you have come to 11" just below ceiling. If there is a window in between, add to left and right if window same concept. Take measurements of ceiling after cabinet base has been factored to determine how many you can run up the wall in 11" between each shelf. Gives enough room for her books in between shelving. (she no longer needs the desk b/c one is being built in.) <br>  <br>  Jewelry storage....there are mirrors that hang on the back of the door that open up and on the inside it store all of your jewelry. offered at QVC.com and other places as well. If you do not want to spend money on back of door jewelry armoire, take a piece of corkboard and glue to the back of your daughters door and buy tons of cheap push-pins that she can hang her jewelry from. Gets her jewelry out of the way and concealed behind door. <br>  <br>  Guinea pig cage.....Take a piece of plywood and cut to exact top measurements of guinea pig cage, place cut plywood on top of guinea pig cage, and this can be used as a bed side table for her. (no different than the dog crates on market that are also side tables too. Take light weight breathable fabric to conceal cage below. <br>  <br>  To provide more floor space remove dresser mirror from base of dresserand hang from wall, if you don't have enough space to fit it. Take dresser move to end of bed. <br>  <br>  If you cant get rid and replace green rug, repaint wall to a soft sage or opt to go funky/girly and make the wall purple. By coordinating purple/green bedding that is modern. <br>  <br>  Check out www.Walmart.com andwww. IKEA.com also  Check out www.pbteen.com and see what I mean. Also www.Target. com really cool purple and green bedding at all these stores and very affordable<br>  <br>  Replace any hampers or totes with retractable foldable type. When not in use they will be out of her way., and they can be folded and stored in a drawer. www.taylorgifts.com. <br>  <br>  In addition, tp provide greater underbed storage buy bed lifts..check out www.bedbathandbeyond.com and ebay...they sell for $20.00 for 4 lifts. <br>  <br>  Next they make underbedskirts that are clear and have pockets in them for storage...check out www.asseenontvnetwork.com This will hold her shoes, extra toys, books, etc. Place regular bedskirt as normal over this storage bedskirt. If you do not wish to purchase and are handy with a sewing machine, take a regular bedskirt, extra fabric and sew pockets to it going all around bed. <br>  <br>  Next, their are storage boxes on rollers that can be purchased to fit under her bed for more storage....www.taylorgifts.com  <br>  <br>  Well, I think I have covered all of the items and where to put them as state above. Remember to weed put any garbage or items she no longer wants and give to charity. If you have any questions e-mail me. Happy Organizing and Decorating!!<br>  <br>  Hope this info helps!|`|AA10979361	Wowzers! This is a huge task you are taking on all at once! Are you planning on tackling on this project with the help of your daughter, I hope? You can do all the organizing you want & get everything in place, but the only person that will serve is YOU. Get her in her room, have her empty it completely. She needs to go through everything she owns & decide what she can't live without, & what she hasn't touched in the last 6 months. <br>  *In another room, put 3 very large boxes, or laundry baskets. Label them 'Trash', 'Donate' & 'Keep' <br>  *Start by organizing things by catagories, for instance, all her clothes. <br>  * Have her 'donate', or throw out, any clothes that she has not worn in the last 6 months, or anything she just doesn't like, or just won't wear. It does not matter if it is brand new, or if it is sentimental, it needs to be out of her room.<br>  *Continue on with this procedure until you & your daughter have gone through absolutely everything she owns. <br>  *While her room is empty, evaluate what kind of furniture, shelving, & other storage units she needs in her room. <br>  *Now is a good time to look into fresh paint & carpet. If new carpet is not in the budget, look into a large area rug. Take your daughter shopping with you. She can help pick out colors.<br>  *Ikea has great storage supplies, & shelving units. <br>  *Also, look into those vacuum-type, space saving, storage bags for out of season & extra bedding, & clothes. <br>  * See what she has in her room that can really be stored SOMEWHERE ELSE in the house. <br>  *When you have gotten all the new storage supplies & shelving & everything elsse you need to be sure everything will have a good place in her room, have YOUR DAUGHTER put it ALL away, NOT you!! You can over-see what she is doing, maybe make suggestions only if she needs it, but have her put her own things away. That way she will take ownership of her belongings, & know where everything should be that makes sense to her. <br>  <br>  You should know that this is not a task to be completed in 1 day only. You should have your daughter sleep in another room until this huge project is completed.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Happy cleaning!!

Un even grout will occur if the floor isn t flat so the installer is right about that.  But he was wrong in doing a job that had a floor that wasn t flat. Part of his duty when bidding or  time of installing is a floor inspection. And he should ve brought it to your attention and tell you that it ll be a bit extra to fix it or tell you that you have a dip or hump.  It may have been a simple fix or something costing  some money, I can t see it from here.  Give him a chance to fix it. Then work w/ him to see if it can be worked out..Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there   GL|`|UQWusO1waa	he probably sells used cars when he is not tiling.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	Has he grouted already?  Sometimes even when they are evenly spaced they don't look right BEFORE the grout, but will look OK when the grout is installed.   This is a bit of an optical illusion because there is no backer in the spaces between the sheets.<br>  <br>  If he has already grouted and they still look uneven then you have a problem.  You can try to have them taken out and reinstalled, but then he is going to say why didn't you say something before I grouted.<br>  <br>  Now if he has not grouted and you want to check the spaces, get a solid object that is the exact width of the spaces of the meshed tiles and place it between the others.  If it is too wide in more than one or 2 spots make him fix it now.|`|q8vILEpfaa	Sorry it sounds like you got a bad installer.<br>  <br>  Take pictures, tell the installer you want it fixed and new installed properly and the repair is to be his expense. that is if you trust him to do it right.<br>  <br>  He has to be given the right to fix his mistake, if you have no trust that it will be done correct take him to court and ask for the cost of repair to be paid for buy original installer.

YYcR6lESaa	teh best thing to do would be to keep the hardwood floor and not cover it with a new carpet. during the winter it may be cold to walk on but that has a simple and cheap answer "slippers". carpets hold to much dust and mold if not cleaned every two to three months and can do serions harm. its even worse if not throughly and professionaly cleaned at least once a year on top of the monthly cleaning you would have to do. carpets can grow Black mold that has been known to cause Pneumonia and bronchial infections.

Get it in a neutral, or the predominant room color. It might cost you $80.|`|oZsYtB0Paa	Depends on what the hardwood looks like. You can always get a rug to cover up part of the floor you walk on so it is not so cold. <br>  <br>  If you want a new carpet I would suggest ripping up the hardwood if you know the sub floor is good. If you had mildew and mold it means you had moisture problem probably which could also caused mildew a mold in the hardwood. <br>  <br>  If you purchase a good quality pad with a new carpet it will take care of the moisture.|`|aa2131f0b0d93de418b8d02cace49bafaa	We did the same thing in our bedroom when we first moved in.

Dm8s3bBLaa	I think you could do a few things to make your room feel better, but I'm not sure you can really fight the sun a lot.  I live in Florida, too.. and my room is on the hot side of the house as well.  Here are some of the things I did:<br>  <br>  - 100% light-blocking curtains.  If it's blocking 100% of the light, it's also blocking most of the heat.<br>  <br>  - Don't close your door so much.  Leave your door open and the fan on to ensure it doesn't get stuffy.<br>  <br>  - Put some plants in your room.  Plants breathe out oxygen and can actually make a room feel less stuffy.<br>  <br>  - When it's cool outside, open your window to let your room breathe some.<br>  <br>  - Plant trees outside of your window to shade that part of your house.  Even if you plant them outside of the walls of your house, they will still block heat.  Bamboo is a great solution to keep your house protected from the heat.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.. good luck!|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Try putting a fan right in front of the vent.

The dark colored material you have now will absorb more sunlight energy and then radiate it into your room. <br>  <br>  Check the AC ducts into your room and make sure the dampers are open.  If they are not, I would extend a new duct into your room that connects to the AC return air for more circulation. As suggested earlier, a booster fan in the supply-air duct might help too.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	If all the other rooms are ok and it's just yours. <br>  if your able to see the duck pipes leading to you room, check and see if it has been damperd  off, You'll find small levers on the side of the duck work.<br>  <br>  if not that, you can buy a booster fan that installs inside the duck work

yu9PHV4Maa	unfortunately you are asking a very vague question...best help I can give is if you feel they are sugar feeding ants try the Terro ant gel...if you think they are protein feeders go with Combat brand.  Avoid using ant sprays near the baits as to not disturb the feeding...depending on the species and size of the colony you may have good results in a few days or it can take weeks.  If you think they may be carpenter ants (very large ant), once again their are different circumstances that may be attracting them and would take different processes to get rid of them.|`|HZjiNEMDaa	Natural Ant Killers<br>  - soapy water (teaspoon of dish detergent in a water spray bottle)<br>  - water mixed with citrus peels<br>  <br>  Natural Ant Repellent<br>  - powdered charcoal, turmeric, cayenne pepper, cinammon, citrus oil are great ant “barriers” (ie they apparently won’t cross over these substances).<br>  <br>  To kill (leave on for a minute or so and wipe up)<br>  <br>  Windex – spray on the groups of ants and or if you have discovered where they are coming from. (Mind this might stain carpets and upholstery).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Vinegar – mix 2 parts with one part water, spray or splash and wipe (will kill ants and disrupt smell). Vinegar also works well for mold and moldy smells (use it to clean and for smell leave in dish overnight in problem area).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Listerine (high alcohol one) or highly peroxide mouthwash – use like the vinegar and Windex.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Vodka -(I don’t know if flavored ones will work or make it worse) – use like the rest…and don’t smoke. …psst in spite of the Myth busters episode this in a slightly watered down spray form will work with bees and wasps but be careful they may be drunk not dead depending on exposure.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Bleach cleaner – will kill but be careful what you use it on and with (no ammonia).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Keeping them out (these you generally want to leave for a bit)<br>  Talc (talcum powder) – for some reason this really seems to work on all sorts of ants (not to kill but to discourage once you have taken care of the ants that are already there). Rub on the carpet, titles, and wood, whatever –leave for a day or so if you can then you can vacuum but the idea is it disrupts the “good route” sent marks.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Baking soda – use the same as you would the talc<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Comet or Ajax – rub on tile and counter – will bleach so be careful. In a water mix will kill as well.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  White paste toothpaste – rub on area with paper towel.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Devious tricks<br>  Mix active baking yeast or plaster of pairs with something the ants would like (honey sugar etc) - the idea is the ants that find it die and the marks they left become “bad”.<br>  <br>  Homemade Ant Killer<br>  This homemade ant killer recipe is really cheap to make and does a great job of killing ants. <br>  <br>  Recipe:<br>  <br>  1 teaspoon boric Acid <br>  6 tablespoons of sugar<br>  2 cups of boiling hot water<br>  <br>  Mix ingredients and pour over cotton balls <br>  Put mixture in used margarine containers with lids and poke holes about 1/8 inch from the bottom.<br>  <br>  Don't worry if it seems you have more ants the first couple of days after a couple of days your ant problem should be gone.<br>  <br>  The ants will swarm into the container. Some of the ant will carry the mixture back to the colony, where it will kill other ants.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ant killer recipe #2<br>  <br>  1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>  1/2 cup molasses<br>  1 Package dry yeast<br>  <br>  Stir ingredients together. Use a few drops of this solution on a piece of cardboard or wood and place where you found the ants.<br>  <br>  Don't use these homemade ant killer where children or animals can get into it.   <br>  <br>  What about homemade killers like boric acid, chalk, glass cleaners, talcum powder, Diatomaceous earth etc. <br>  <br>  Let's look at them one at a time. They all have advantages & disadvantages.<br>  <br>  Boric Acid in a sugar base. One of the best of the homemade controls. Boric Acid in a sugar syrup or mixed with sugar is right up there at the top of the research results. Not always consistent results. sometimes it worked well, other times not as well. It's certainly the cheapest way to go. Sugar baits can give a quick knockdown but do not usually reach all the stages of ant life. <br>  In one of the research trials the boric acid had killed fewer ants than the pure peanut butter control....however in a longer trial boric acid killed all of the Pharaoh ants, queens and all within 7 weeks. <br>  In my own yard, I had great great results in one spot, no more ants for about 6 or 7 months. In another spot in the same yard, same mixture...used over and over again and it seemed to have no results at all??? . <br>  Diatomaceous earth. This natural product is made up of microscopic very sharp pieces. It is a very good barrier against ants & snails .Making a circle around citrus trees can be one of your tools to keep the ants away. Chinese chalk and talcum powder probably work the same way. If ants are coming in to your garden from a neighbor a barrier of Diatomaceous earth can help. Be careful not to breathe in the dust. <br>  Windex and other glass cleaners do a quick job of discouraging ants in the home. The ants often return as soon as you turn your back. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Don't forget that just because you make something in your kitchen doesn't mean it is not toxic. Boric acid is a poison and should be used carefully just like any other toxic substance. Always be careful and keep everything out of the reach of children and pets. Sugar syrups especially can be tempting. Always read all the directions on a product and follow them.

h6NqNzHAaa	No, please don't, the oils in the bubble bath will damage the whirlpool mechanisms.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No! You will suffocate and probably flood the room!!|`|TGyYcmKhaa	I had a whirlpool tub in my house and I used to use bubble bath all the time.  You have to be right there though because it makes very thick foamy bubbles and can easily over flow the tub with them.<br>  <br>  As for it harming the motor, the water doesn't go thru the motor so it's not going to do that.  I worked for a home builder and asked the question about bubble bath and was told that while the oils in the bubble bath may build up on the tubing/jets if you do it a lot, if you get the stuff they use to clean hot tubs with, you should not have any problems.  They sell the stuff at Home Depot and probably Lowes or anywhere that sells hot tubs.<br>  <br>  I miss my whirlpool tub because you just can't get the bubbles in a regular tub like you get with a whirlpool.  Just remember, don't turn it on and walk away or you will have a room full of bubbles!!   My friend had glass shower doors on her whirlpool tub because it also had a shower head in the tub.  She put bubble bath in the tub turned on the jets and left the room momentarily.  When she returned the bubbles had completely filled the space behind the glass doors.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Bubbles and oils will jam up the whirlpool jets so no, just water if you are using the jets.

pPr4gWXyaa	The seal in the regulating valve that controls the flow of water into your toilet cistern has failed, this is the valve that allows water to replenish the cistern tank when flushed, in this case it sounds like the pan fills up faster than it can empty waste water. Try holding the ball float up in the shut off position to see if water stops flowing, if it doesn't then you will have to shut your water off at the rising main and replace the valve.<br>  <br>  There might be a blockage in the drains but if there was the water flush would not continue to overspill the pan after the flush had completed.<br>  <br>  The valve is not expensive and can be purchased at most hardware stores, you will need a set of spanners and some grips to do this easy little job.|`|AA10979361	Quick, reach back & turn off the water supply! <br>  Plunge, plunge, plunge till it drains out all the way. <br>  Turn water back on, keeping plunger handy.

That balloon thing that floats on top of the water is supposed to stop letting water into the bowl when the water level raises it to a certain position (about parallel to the ground).  It is connected to a chain which closes the flap that lets water into the bowl.  This chain is probably disconnected.  Your problem could be more than that, though, and you will have to buy a new mechanism for your tank.<br>  <br>  <br>  Once you turn off the valve,  flush the toilet a few more times.  that will allow water out of the bowl, and use up what is in the tank so you can fix it.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	its blocked.|`|XMxf8BGSaa	I hope its not really pouring out.. cause if it is..you are wasting alot of time typing your question when your house is flooding!|`|um29wkUPaa	Nah, don't listen to them.

Outdoors however, the shoots can die off from the cold in winter. sometimes the plant will shoot in the fall or winter, not shoot in the spring, and then start on a regular cycle the following spring, after puting plenty of energy into rhziome and root development.Beth

The cap will allow air out, but deflect the wind.<br>  <br>  Also, have pilot cleaned.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	If it ONLY happens with a high wind, then obviously whatever ventilation you have for the water heater is in a spot that allows the wind to blow straight across the pilot light.<br>  <br>  Consider hiring a licensed plumber to come in, look it over, and perhaps move the vent hole to allow the pilot to stay lit, while still allowing ventilation.|`|Ncu1wJU4aa	It would be unusual for the wind to blow down the vent pipe, through the draft hood and down to the pilot.<br>  Some mobile home water heaters do not have a draft hood and the vent is connected directly to the top of the water heater without a draft hood. In these units its possible for wind to affect the pilot flame but still not likely.<br>  Are you sure it's caused by wind?<br>  Here are some other reasons your pilot may be going out.<br>  <br>  Your pilot has too low of a flame and not hitting the thermocouple properly. Low pilot flame would be caused by the pilot orifice being dirty. Dis-assembly and cleaning of the pilot orifice would be necessary.<br>  <br>  A weak pilot could also be distinguished by the burner popping when the burner shuts off. Turn the burner off and on by the thermostat to see how it shuts off and whether it knocks the pilot out.<br>  If so clean burner and pilot.|`|98p5v51zaa	Your problem is caused by downdrafts coming down the vent pipe when the wind blows. This could be caused by either a faulty vent cap or that the vent pipe is not high enough above the roof line. When the vent pipe is not high enough above the roof line the wind can swirl and cause downdrafts when at the proper height the wind will blow across the vent pipe actually creating a vacuum effect which helps to exhaust the fumes created and to allow make-up air from the bottom to help the pilot light stay lit. The vent pipe may also be clogged which would prevent the pilot from receiving make-up air to maintain a flame.|`|8e3c1da786497f2130276d9d3c413210aa	Sounds like a weak pilot.

You can also use baking soda and water on a hard surface after you clean it up to absorb the odor.  Other than that burn candles or boil apple cider vinegar and water to cover up the smell.
