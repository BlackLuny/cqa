82c034bbba1a57407446ce3e9b74f6f2aa	There is a really easy way to tell if your CV joints are going out.  When you turn your wheels and press on the gas it will sound like a light clicking noise at first.  When they are getting really bad it will sound like you have a bunch of marbles behind your hubcaps.  It is really a noise that is hard to miss.  They aren't the easiest thing on a vehicle to work on, but it is possible to do it yourself with simple tools, a jack and some jack stands.  As far as the price you can find that at www.autozone.com|`|5be2a27fb1e3c0ffb041c2dadd58c11aaa	$200-$250    If its the outer joint it will click while accelerating through a turn.    If its the inner joint it will vibrate while accelerating.    The price is the same for either. The part ishould cost around $80-$100, its not too dificult a job really.
ZFPytNoWaa	Check your battery cables. tightness, cleanliness and so on. i had a similar problem all the lights worked and the motor would crank, it just wouldn't start. i removed and reinstalled my negative cable from the battery and it's worked ever since. it a cheap and easy thing to check before you blow a lot of money at a shop. also, it could be the mercedes anti theft system.try using another key, or see what your owners manual says
zSmcyrgPaa	Best way to check to know for a fact would be a back pressure check. This is done by drilling a small hole in front of the converter and putting a probe in and it will give you a actual reading. allot of time when the converter is clogged it wont rattle cuz every thing is melted together at the outlet.|`|f3af137c6aa10863392adcf146ea6a2aaa	If it is clogged and you push the gas pedal down real fast the car should take right off, if it hesitates and doesn't run right then it could be clogged|`|NNmU0iyQaa	if the vehicle wont run right and will only get to very slow speeds.....  good chance the converter is plugged..... building to much back pressure and cutting your performance  way down.... been there done that......|`|ZFPytNoWaa	hold your hand behind the pipe, but not to close, or you could get burned, and see if you can feel air coming out.

yhrmpU00aa	Yes, it is possible you blew either the "Start" or "Ign" fuse, but all the fuses for your van are located under the driver's side dash, against the firewall.  I would also suspect a bad battery, as in it may have enough voltage, but now it doesn't have enough amperage to trun the starter or click the solenoid.   If all fuses are good and you have a second vehicle, I would take it to Autozone or Advance Auto to have it tested.|`|Q5kKSpQ3aa	Check the fusable link going to your starter.

NRtqNelmaa	The most reliable way to check it is to remove the oxygen sensor closest to but in front of the converter and install a low pressure gauge in its place. Start the warmed engine and hold at 200 rpm. If pressure reads more than 1.25 psi then the converter needs replacing. Next best check is to install a vacuum gauge on the intake. Rev engine to 2000 rpm while watching gauge. The needle should dip when the throttle is first opened, rise to a certain point and then slowly fall as backpressure builds from the exhaust restriction.|`|WG79VhLfaa	feel how much exhaust is coming out of the exhaust pipe|`|xXQEhTyHaa	Get a vacuum gauge and attach it to a vacuum source, with engine running rev it up and if gauge goes to zero, the converter is shot.|`|NiFAP2tIaa	If the car is fine when it is cold and then gets sluggish when hot, then th cat is bad.|`|UZSythqhaa	If the cat is stopped up you will know soon enough but the best way is to drive it a little hard for about 5-10 minutes at night. Leave it pull over and leave the engine running pop the hood and look at the exhaust pipes if they are glowing red then your cat is bad. As far as the tranny it depends on the type of tranny automatic or  standard and what type of vehicle it is also the year model try asking that way... Good luck....Peace|`|8tlTotzjaa	If the problem occurred right after the trans installation then the problem is not the converter.If you can disconnect the converter in front and the power comes back,guess what?Try a fuel filter first.|`|933c588b0680f140e29c74088813f28caa	A good way to check for a stopped up catalytic converter is by using a hand held laser temperature reading device. Get the car at operating temperature,then take a reading just a few inches in front of the converter..then another reading the same distance behind the converter. The readings should be close to equal. If there is greater temperature reading on the engine side of the converter exaust....you can get ready to buy a new converter. NOTE: BE SURE TO USE GOOD JACK STANDS OR A LIFT WHILE WORKING UNDER YOUR CAR!!!! BE SAFE .    One of above answere I totally disagree with. Why get your car so hot as to see the exaust on the engine side glow red??? Your trying to fix a problem & not create another. Your not trying to blow a head gasket, warp your valves,or crack a head on your car. Think about it !!

You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - carquotes.imess.net|`|RknydzkZaa	If you want cheap, then find a used car.  <br>  If you want something that is reliable, then look for a Honda (such as the civic), or a Ford Focus.  <br>  <br>  Be sure and have an independent mechanic check the car out before you buy (it's worth the 50 quid).|`|PZOyNlKaaa	You can buy a Ford Fiesta or Chevy from GM, but...I love Mustang.|`|iq67KsNXaa	Well, I think that it depends how much you're gonna spend. If you're looking for under $5k, then perhaps look at cars for sale at least 5 years old. Mazda has a lot of great cars that as they get older make good cars for teens such as the Mazda3, Mazda6, and the Mazda RX-8. Also it depends on your personality, whether or not you're sporty, cool, trying to be fuel efficient, and more. The Mazdas I just mentioned can come in both manual or automatic.
bvCkplELaa	The oil pressure switch is on the engine, and I wouldn't listen to one thing that person told you. Too funny. I'd get it to a shop and not try to fix it over the net. You are wasting time with this and rediculous answers as you just mentioned.

Check the parts cost on <a href="http://www.autozone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.autozone.com</a><br>  You need to check for good ignition spark with a spark tester to see if your losing spark when it happens.

Check the link out.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Locate and clean out your throttle body, throttle body plate, and idle air control valve. This should restore some power. With the engine fully warmed and running, insert spray Gum-out tube into a vacuum fitting on intake manifold or through throttle body snorkel tube. If your catalytic converter has built up some carbon, this should dislodge it. Go to a muffler shop and have them examine the converter for signs of clogging. Changing the fule filter should have helped a lot. You might also have a bad fuel pressure regulator. This problem does NOT show up in fault codes. Good Luck!!!

ywPADGDNaa	First off I sell Chevy's and considering they are the same price I'm guessing the LS has less miles than the LT, just a guess. Its up to you I would go with the LT cause it has more on it and holds more value than the LS. Go to this PDF to see options http://www.chevrolet.com/m/06/quickfacts...  So looking at that see if it is a 2LT or a 1LT. Also, in my own professional opinion it kind of odd to see two cars used that are a year old. To me as a salesman it means that they have been in a accident or are not clean, if they are both Chevrolet Certified than no worries they have to be clean or else chevy would not certify them. Make sure to look at a carfax and demand you get one they have to. Also ask why they were traded in. Another bit of info for you hold out on the pricing as much as possible walk out if they don't come down always haggle because used cars have like 4 grand profit in them so they will always come down.

OM8G07mbaa	It depends. Delta tends to put their PTV 757's on transcons, and they send all their good equipment to ATL. Now, that's not a guarantee you'll get one, but you have a good chance. Now, if you were flying a 737-800, you'd certainly have TV's. The 73's that do transcons all have PTV's  The ones with the PTV's are ex-song.|`|fCOq04lNaa	I haven't flown it, but Delta puts its ex-Song 757s(the ones with the TVs) on trans-cons, so there's a decent chance of getting one, and they tend to be based on ATL.

The person who mentioned the Model T, I believe it was is someone who should have their head examined, but everyone has their own view points.  I have to say the Honda, but actually the Honda Accord Hatchback in 1984, I'm being really specific as that car was incredible.  My old car would still be on the road if I hadn''t finally sold it to someone who couldn't drive very well, Mr. Magoo the 2nd.  He drove it into pothole and telephone poles and it was still going.  Finally he and his wife moved out of the country and got rid of the car, but it still drove.  The car from Back to the Future is a Delorean, you can still find them around.  First car to use Gullwing doors.  Cars were made in Ireland.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	That depends on how you define "best"?  Best top speed?  Best fuel economy?  Best towing capacity?

n7jXAQFWaa	Well Google Maps says it's an hour drive, so add 30 mins for bad weather and wrecks and it's not too bad. I live in the DC area and plenty of people put up with that kind of drive all the time. Whether or not you take the train is really up to you. I guess the parking in NH and your concerns about putting mileage on your car could come into play.

bkpa5OHtaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.undonet.com|`|u0lRzaXSaa	I would highly recommend the BMW. I have owned many and they are great driving cars and the engines will go forever. I had one that had 280K miles on it and it did not use a bit of oil. Regrettably, my son had an accident and totaled it.  If you are able to do oil changes and brake work as needed, this car should not cost you much to keep on the road.|`|FT7W3f6yaa	I don't know your background so it is hard to say. It will cost you a bit to maintain a 80k BMW. 80k BMW engine is not the end of its life but it is the beginning of the end. Do you know what I am trying to say? Lots of stuff will start to border you a little at a time. The previous owner sounds like a really smart person. "30 pages maintenance folder... the last owner was a freak. He gave his 325i back to buy a 2006 X3"    60k for Japanese and 80k for Continental car. That is the magic figure.
VC7PyH53aa	Offer 1100.00 and don't buy unless you're provided maintenance records.  Also make sure it's not been in a serious accident.     If properly maintained and body in good condition you should be able to take it to 250k with no serious problems.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I would say yeah. I just sold a 99 Camry with 170k on it for $2700. As long as the Maxima looks and drives good it is a decent price.|`|Vsh9Ot9haa	Give her a $1000, that would be a good deal|`|XH4O3ozFaa	No.  800-1000 if mechanically sound and SE.|`|62be2b7b7a35e2d608e657b3ba8393acaa	You probably can come down off the asking price. Find out if the car has mechanical issues (leaking oil, coolant, etc.), see if the car will need tires soon, ask if the sunroof leaks. If possible have someone trusted come with you and review the car or take it to your mechanic. Try to get her to come down to $1,000-$1,200 if the car seems to have lots of issues considering what you will have to spend to fix it.     Maximas usually last a long time if well cared for. My 1987 Maxima had NO mechanical issues and was a good car for 21 years until it was totalled. If you maintenance your car properly, there is no reason it should not see 250K miles. Good luck!|`|Q5tR52Oxaa	YES if its running and smog able and if it has not been over heating or gone for years with out an oil change.    Every one that see mine says these are the best body styles ever for customizing or tuning like adding a turbo, supercharger, and or NOS.
nvQ4WtcBaa	early in the morning or late at night when it's cold you can get more petrol in your tank because the fuel is more dense you can get more in for little less money|`|0qGwCA1Baa	in my town ive noticed they raise the gas on thursday nights right before rush hour and it goes back down sunday night so i always fill up on wednesday after work|`|ZS17qeVvaa	at night or in the morning before it gets hot because gas pumps measures volume not density. the hotter it is the lighter the fuel so of course the colder it is the more dense it is. meaning you get more gas when its colder out.

XH4O3ozFaa	What engine? Turbo or V^ or 4?  headers without new intake and exhaust will not add but maybe 1-3 MPG and 5 HP With rest will get 5 more MPG and 20-30 HP and if shorty headers same torque.  If not turbo do not add as you will have more money in mods needed then car cost.  add all sythetic fluids as a lot less friction will give up to 25-35 HP and add life to engine for about 175.00 for all like Engine, tranny, rear end, steering fluid and brake fluid.Adding 30-40 torque to car will be a very noticable increase especially with Jetta.  Turbo without mods may not give but 10-50HP and car will be unsafe and need constant attention with suspenion and brakes as well as over heating and aixles. Cost is 3000+ whereas other is 1000.00 and will work and not  void anything as well as car will last longer.|`|QyCQMiUCaa	HEADERS WONT DO ANYTHING.

However, I can't honestly answer your question without knowing what type of motor you have in the car...    If it's a 2.0:    There's not much you can do.  The 2.0 in the VW community is affectionately known as the 2.slow.  You can try putting a CAI and an exhaust on the car, but it will be futile.    However, if money isn't an issue--if you can find one, get you a 1.8l 16v head from an A1 or A2 GLi or GTi.  Then get a small turbo like a Garrett T3/T4, a CAI, turbo back exhaust, and a performace chip or a standalone ECU like the MegaSquart N' Spark.    If it's 1.8T:    Simple.  The great thing about the 1.8T is that it's very easily modified.  To get some quick HP/TQ try: a CAI, header-back exhaust, performance chip, better intercooler, and maybe even a larger turbo.    A combination of just a CAI, exhaust and chip will you net you another 70-120hp.    But remember, you can get all the power you want, but if you don't have the suspension and the tires to get to the ground, it's worthless.

b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Its rather simple. If the plane explodes into a fireball, thats what you call it. A fireball. It doesnt matter what the source of the fireball is.   When the missile itself explodes you dont see any fire unless its at night, it just usually looks like a puff of smoke in the daytime.   If the missile flies directly into the aircraft, its called a direct hit. Most kills are from the shrapnel thrown out by the explosive warhead in the missile.

This means that your door chimes and On-Star (if equipped) runs through the factory stereo and also the factory harness does not use an accessory wire to turn the radio on/off with the ignition key but instead has a data wire that tells the stereo when the key is on to allow it to power up. The interface harness/module you need converts the data information from the car to provide an ignition source for an aftermarket radio to operate properly and retains On-Star operation and also has a small built in speaker to provide the door chimes.|`|hZWup7xXaa	if it is a power converter then no you dont need it.to install you go to canadiantire and look for the wireing kit for the amp and subsand then get a wire asembly kit that has the same year and date on it as your car and it well hook right into the deck and well give you all the right colors of wires that your car has for very easy instalation.now when you go to hook up your amp and subs take the big red wire and run that from the poitive of your amp to the positive of your batterie.now run the big green wire to any good boult in your trunk and then to the ground on the amp.and for  the skinny blue and gray wire those are your remote wiers thay go to the cd deck thay mack shure that when you turn the deck off the amp well turn off the batterie.now the convert-er well come in when you are running some sereous watts but a normal car batterie can handle to about 2000watts no problem.hope this helps.|`|HDK10qYZaa	on the back of some cd players they have 2 or 4 rc out puts so you can hook up rc cables from your amp to your cd player, if you dont have the out puts on the back you need a converter. the converter  makes it so you have rc out puts, its wired from your decks front speaker wires,  which you will need to run your amp. best buy should have them. there like 30 bucks i think.
a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	That would be unusual.  The tire size P265/75R16 114S has NEVER been an OEM size on the F150.  The Chevy half-ton yes, but not the Ford.  More likely you have a P265/70R16 111 sized tire as this was OEM on some 4x4 XLT extended and crew cab models.      P255/70R16 109S would be the standard size primarily on the lighter 4x2 trucks, thus the lower load index of 109 instead of the 111 required by 4x4 trucks.  This is one of those times where year and specific model information would be oh so helpful.  At any rate no, unless the tire load and inflation tag inside the drivers door specifies a P255/70R16 109S sized tire I would absolutely not recommend DOWNGRADING your tires to this size.

If I were you, I'd consult a lawyer and get a full assessment on the situation and set up very clear guidelines to the couple who bought your car of when payments are expected and what the repercussions are (like taking the car back regardless).

Its a run of the mill car, at a decent price. Its not fancy, its not flashy its not fast, but its just ok. Don't expect anything to be outstanding on the car, but then again, nothing will be bad, it'll all be average, which is a decent thing for a first car, or a in town daily driver. Ask about service history, Where the car has lived previously(like country or city, shows wear and tear over low miles) and who owned it last (sex, age etc)    Happy Hunting

6uogGZZVaa	Depends what your going to do to it. Personally, I've experienced that anyone with a P Plate on a semi decent car, or a car that MIGHT be modified is an instant target for the police. Like i can drive my farm ute (1987 Nissan Navara) past a cop doing like 110 (when it gets up to it) and they won't even care, but i can be doing 85 in my Car (a Vt Commodore S (body kit and mag wheels) and they will pull me up and have a inspection.

Lf3wiwsNaa	Your car may have an electronic speed "governor" or "regulator" that overrides your acceleration input (pressing the gas peddle) at a predetermined speed.    I had a 1996 Buick Regal that did something similar to your description.     Try to ask your dealership or research your car online to see if that is something your car might have.    The only way to describe the way my car acted is just like you said it seemed to have run out of gas or was going to die/turn off. Every time I got it to around 75mph. Then when it dropped to a significantly lower speed I could accelerate again and everything was back to normal.    Maybe that is your cars only "problem", but I never noticed any warning lights coming on in my similar circumstances...|`|y09wh1CZaa	engine misses are due to :  plugs need to be cleaned/ one of them is nt working   air filter is blocked with dust or any dirt and stuff like tht  u mentioned oil light tht is also a reason whihc seems conveioncing the oil flow is nt proper into the engine might be because a tube has a leak or due to dirt .    any car mechanic even nt trained enough would check up these things and rectify this   make sure u do not have oil leak to check where ever u park ur car while driving out just give a look at the place where it was parked if there is oil stright away take it to garage because SEAL is broken which also causes misses in engine and is really dangerous for car engine .....|`|0qGwCA1Baa	make sure they put the right amount of oil in,and see if it does it when you have cruise control onn.it might be in the transmission it might be as simple as adding a small bottle of lubegard it really works for tranny shuttering,and heat.Id say the wind will mess with you if your doing 65 and its blowing very hard,certain gust here and there pushing back on the car yea i could see that.

BPgqX8tYaa	Don't you hate it when some smart a** posts a web site instead of just answering the question? The least he/she can do is check it and see if there is actually an answer to the question there, and give it.    Anyhow, washes won't give your Durango a shine. If you have swirl marks it's because someone who didn't know what they were doing used an abrasive cleaner or a non-automotive detergent, like dishwashing detergent. Dishwashing detergent is harsh, designed for use on glass and porcelain, not paint.    Clay bar cleaners are not intended to shine your car's finish. They are to remove oxidized paint which can dull the finish. After they are used the paint still needs to be polished and waxed.    You need a professional detailing. They will use a high-quality polish specifically designed to bring up the shine without removing the finish or leaving swirl marks.     You can do it yourself but you need the right equipment. A power drill with a buffer attachment won't do it. The speed needs to be regulated to avoid "burning" the finish or polishing through the clear coat.    The pros use Zymol products. They're expensive, but they work. You can get 16 oz of Z505 Concentrated Auto Wash for $8.99, and 16 oz of Liquid Cleaner Wax for $9.49 from the Auto Barn at amazon.com.|`|AA12160610	If you know how to use a buffer. There is a product that 3 M makes called Finesse It. Read the directions on the bottle very carefully and you can take out all the swirl marks and make it shine. You will have to buy the foam pad that goes with the product. You can buy it at any auto paint store. Use just enough to buff an area 12X12. A little bit bigger than quarter size of the polish is all you need to buff the 12X12 area. Wet the pad down and ring out the water to help with the heat. If your swirl marks are deep you may have to reapply the polish to the area. Use medium to fast speed depending on your experience with a buffer. Make sure you keep the foam pad as flat as possible during the process because the foam pad heats up very fast and will burn the paint very easily. Apply medium pressure on the buffer to start the buffing and when the polish starts to dry use the weight of the buffer or light pressure to finish the area. When you are satisfied with the results wash the car then use the polish like you would when you wax your car it helps with the gloss and take out the smudges from the polish when buffing.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	It's really hard to say          http://www.toboc.com/forum3/default.aspx...  http://www.toboc.com/forum3/default.aspx...|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Car wash soap will clean your surface, does not have much to do with shine. Clay bar removes surface contaminants, will give you a smooth glossy surface, Polish will feed the paint, remove minor imperfections, such as swirls, and give you shine, wax will seal and protect your shine.  Take a look at the tech articles in the link below, they have step by step washing, polishing, swirl removing articles.
WOYgurwfaa	Go with neon. LED underbody lights available today are not bright enough. The best (and most expensive) LED underbody lights available today use only small 5mm LEDs. They are arranged to only cast focused light in a small strip along the side of the car. Small LEDs need to be focused in order to be able to see it. Neon on the other hand is higher output and doesn't need the focusing. With neon your car will actually look like the entire underbody is lit up. With LED your car will look like a little line of light is around your car.  Secondly just go out and look at the price of neon vs. LED. Neon is a lot cheaper.|`|8U3sVjzUaa	don't buy neon or led lights under your car, put blue lightning stickers all around your car, and then buy a nos sticker and put it on your rear windshield so people wil lbe afraid to race you. and then buy some big chrome rims so they think your car is fast. also don't forget to put a honda sticker on your side windows so they think you are driving a honda civic si. you also need some nice bodykits so it can look cool.|`|ZFPytNoWaa	I personally despise underglow lights, but if I were to do it, I would go with L.E.D.

3NoQuoWuaa	Cancel the policy effective the day you sold the car. There should be a return premium. If you acquired another car before or at the same time you sold this one, you can simply roll the policy over to cover this one. In either event you will have to refer to your agent or broker.r|`|36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	Cancel the insurance after all paperwork is signed and the other buyer has paid in full.|`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Immediately!  If you have turned over the title to the vehicle to the buyer, basically sold it, then you are not responsible for the insurance any more.  Many states require that you also turn in the license plates, so do that also if your state requires it, and make sure you get a receipt for the plates.  Many insurance companies require a copy of that receipt for them to cancel the insurance.  Also many insurance companies require the cancellation in writing.  It usually can be faxed.  By turning in your plates, and cancelling your insurance, negates any responsibility to the car.  If the new owner never gets a title or registration in his name, and has an accident, or gets a ticket, with the insurance cancellation and plate receipt, you will not be held responsible for anything.    You will probably get a partial refund on your insurance.  Only 3 weeks may not be much...but it is something.  And by cancelling your insurance you are basically protecting yourself from any further responsibility to the car.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	Call your insurance broker NOW and tell them you no longer have the car insured with them.

x35co5F8aa	How would I know?    You need to know the circuit to make this decision. In the absence of information, I'd have to assume the original 50V capacitor was chosen because the circuit runs voltages not over 50V, but probably well over 10V in which case it's not safe.    This is electrolytic, right? which means if it's damaged it will rupture. 1000uF is big - this is probably for a power supply - don't skimp on the specs - go over, not under.
5BiBamrxaa	You don't "confess innocence" you confess guilt.  If you want to prove your innocence then you will have a very hard job in the circumstances.  You should be driving to the conditions, if it is icy then you should be driving in a manner that you CAN stop when necessary - this would mean driving a lot slower, braking a lot more gently and earlier etc etc.    Basically - your fault.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Just go in and tell them what happened and what the road conditions were and don't try to blow things out of proportion and hope for the best.|`|wpgRMjgraa	You cant win this........you were driving to fast for the road condition sorry and have a nice day.|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	its still wreck-less driving but try to find the weather condition for that day and print out a paper from a web site with that forecast or call you local news station and tell them what you need they will probably help you out that's a start but be careful because the judge can always add more stuff to you and make it a whole lot worst it might be better to plead no contest and pay the fine.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You can't. If it was icy and you slid, you were driving unsafely. You have no case. Drive safer next time.|`|AtRpdjczaa	First of all, its not wreckless its reckless driving.  Second, it is your fault.  You can't use ice as an excuse, because when driving conditions change you HAVE TO ADJUST your driving to the conditions.  Its no news to cops that when its icy it will take you longer to stop.  That is why you have to start braking early for the stop sign.  So he was right to give you the ticket.  And you don't have to convince the judge that it was due to ice.  The judge will know that.  You had to drive according to road conditions.  So tough ****.  My friend rear ended a car because that driver brake checked him at the speed of 75 mph.  Court's answer:  "You should keep a sufficient following distance, which will allow you to safely come to a stop no matter what happens."  So it's not your lucky day, sorry dude.|`|D7KwEaoXaa	Even though it was icy conditions, it is your responsibility to drive slow enough that you can stop.    You will still be charged, but maybe a lesser offense.  You can't go in and say you are not guilty. They hate that.  You can't say it isn't your fault. They hate that too.    Where I live, you can plead "Guitly with an explanation"    You have to do this.  APOLOGISE. It IS your fault, and you need to admit it.  EXPLAIN. The conditions were icy, you were driving below the speed limit, and you thought you were going slow enough. You tried to stop well before the stop sign, you were slowed down significantly before you hit the patch of ice, you tried to pump your breaks, you tried to steer to avoid a collision.  ADMIT. I know I was the cause of the accident, and I misjudged the speed I should have been traveling at. I was not being reckless, I just made a poor decision. I tried to correct the problem, and I tried to avoid the accident. I'm sorry I caused the accident,   CORRECT. I will be more cautious in the future.    You will still have to pay the court fees, but you may be given a warning or a lesser charge. This will only work, if you have a clean driving history. They will look up your merits, they will look up your accidents, speeding offenses, everything. If you have speeding tickets, it will look like you are a reckless driver, and chances are you won't win.    Good luck!|`|cCATmVHxaa	Hello....First, let me say, that you need to do some homework on your case.  Did the officer admit, that there was ice on the road, was it a patch or was the road completely cover with ice.  Know the distance, that you tried to start, stopping of your car.  About what distance, did you have before you entered the intersection.  Did you pump the brakes or did you just slam on the brakes.  Could you have veered another way, rather into the intersection.  Was the road a down hill situation or was the road level before entering the intersection.  The more you can present to the judge, that it wasn't your fault and shouldn't be cited, the better.  However, you are guilty of causing a wreck but maybe not for reckless driving.  When you did all you could do to prevent it, under the given circumstances.  Accidents do happen, but that doesn't mean that every accident is a cause of reckless driving.  As long as your attention, was driving and nothing else, like using a cell phone or something, then argue that no one could have stopped under the same conditions.

Also, I think, your problem could be several things.  Your alternator could be overcharging your battery.  Cooking it, causing it not to last long.  Problem may be a voltage regulator.  Probably is.  Also, if you have a faulty wire coming from your alternator to your battery, your not getting the proper voltage to the battery, to keep it charged.  Also, if your battery connection is not properly fitted to the positive post and your ground is not grounded properly, due to corrosion or if the connections (especially side posts), that may work loose, that may be your problem.  Also, most cars today do use voltage from the battery, even when the engine is not running.  Your clock and/or any anti-theft light will use   voltage. How much, however should not be your problem.  To summarize, your problem is from the alternator to the battery.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	My daughter has one and we had this problem,the positive  cable runs down behind the motor to the starter and "T's"  off to the starter connection and then continues to the alternator.    where it "T's" off to starter connection there is very little room  for it and is very close to other parts that it can short to.    It came a little loose from the starter and was shorting only  under acceleration and deceleration due to the movment of  the motor back and forth,I could not find the problem when sitting  at an idle,it needs to go up on some ramps and the starter is  on the back bottom of the engine,there is a plastic cover that must  come off to check connections.|`|d737ea63327b6a7be9b660b3cc16cd04aa	Hi there it could be low mileage problem, but if they are changing batteries then they must have found a fault in them. to me i would get some one to check your alternator output as if it is overcharging then it cooks battery and causes failure. and if it is allowed to continue then it cause damage to your electronics  Jock|`|nY3PAjtRaa	the garage is right a low mileage problem what they really means is not the cars actual miles but how much the car is running for.  consider how many miles you do a week and try to give the car 10 mile runs at any one time   a huge amount of amperage is used starting cars and with the miles that you are doing is not enough to recharge before the next start.  also the lack of this charging can cause BATTERSULPHUR-CATIONON which destroys them.

AA10503489	If you are going for the old school look, which I think you are with the Autodrags, then yes. Go wide on the rear. Your Cutlass has big, roomy rear fenders that would look great with some fat tires tucked inside.    Don't go hillbilly old school with the tires sticking out too far. If you use an 8" or 9" wide wheel with 275/60r15 tires back there, it should look perfect.     For driving on the street, use a 6" or 7" wide wheel on the front with a 205/75r15 tire.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	I think wide tires all the way around would look better.  The Cutlass is not a drag car and would not look like one even with the wide tires on back thing.

Ht1aY8THaa	I would actually recommend an all wheel drive vehicle. the computer in an awd will tell the vehicle how much power to put to each wheel as it needs it. gas mileage really isnt affected by awd or 4wd as some might think. like any vehicle, it all depends on how you drive it. All wheel drive is on all time and is made to be that way. 4wd is made to be used occasionally. not all the time. therefor, if you use the 4wd a lot, it could ruin components in the drive train. however there are some disadvantages to awd. awd needs all the tires to be the same, and within a few millimeters of the same diameter. if they are not then the drive train will work against itself causing major problems. so, say you have bought tires 6 months ago and you have used half the tire life. you then blow out one tire that cannot be fixed. you then would need to buy all four new tires. i would still recommend the awd over a 4wd. i hope my response helped you out. if you have any more questions please let me know.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	I would recommend a front wheel drive car, with skinny tires, and as much ground clearance as practical.      As long as you stay on roads, you will not have a problem.    I learned to drive in a rear wheel drive car in Illinois back when winters were real (like this year again), then moved to Minnesota.  Eventually getting a front wheel drive (Honda Civic, minivan, Neon).  Returned to rear wheel drive with a Ranger (added a limited slip differential).  We got a jeep because we want to explore trails in Wyoming, and the Ranger would not go slow enough.|`|9V1xoUr6aa	A 4WD vehicle would probably be better. You got the choice of switching it in and out of 4WD when you don't need it.  An all wheel drive is like that all the time.  The advantage of having a 4WD vehicle versus an all wheel drive vehicle is that you get a little bit better gas mileage. But a 2WD car can also work to.

Basically the way it works is that the agent looks your car over and then you come to an agreement as to what the car is worth in the event of a total loss. So essentially you are insuring your investment more so than the car itself.    In most cases with standard traditional insurance, they will only pay up to the blue-book value of the car. They certainly will not insure $5000+ worth of parts on a 20 year old car. In some instances, I have seen exceptions made where the owner of the car was able to produce reciepts for the aftermarket parts and upgrades and the insurance company reinbursed them accordingly. But if that car is worth only $500 without the upgrade, you can rest assured that with all of your upgrades and parts, it is still worth $500 in the eyes of the insurance company.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	You would have to declare this to the insurer, however one of two things will happen: either the insurer agrees to cover the parts for an additional premium and, in all likelihood, a higher deductible or the insurer decides they want off risk and cancels the policy. If you haven't taken out the policy yet the insurer may just refuse to insure the vehicle. If you do not declare the parts the insurer has grounds to deny a claim altogether, never mind covering the parts.|`|AA11212220	why would put 10 g in a car that 22 years old will you get the money out if you cell it?

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	It needs to be a Boss subwoofer control. It should have been included with the crossover. Every Boss BX35 3 way crossover comes with one. Contact whoever you bought it from and let them know it was not in the package with the crossover because it's supposed to be. You paid for it in the price of the unit so they owe it to you.|`|AA10906914	Off topic:    1) take out fuse near battery.  2) disconnect negative battery terminal.  3) charge cap.      If you do  1 why in the world do you need to do  2?    Taking the fuse out breaks the electrical circuit. There's no need to disconnect the negative terminal. It just adds more work needlessly.    You would pull the fuse, connect the cap, use a light bulb where the fuse was to charge the cap, replace fuse - DONE!

7N1bktyPaa	Try to deal it out of pocket, otherwise insurance rates will go up much more. You can check how quotes will change here - carquotes.sinfree.net|`|BJERgbM5aa	Your up the proverbial creek without a paddle.  If they sue you, they will win.  Not matter what occurred, they will win.  Because you were operating illegally.  Give them the 300 or move if they ask for more.  And pray that no one is hurt and the money is enough to make the whole thing history.  But they can still bring suit against you.  Even if you get a lawyer and have him draw up a release that the people sign when you pay them off, the can still sue you.  Of course, if the people realize that suing you will be an exercise in futility because you have NOTHING, then that might be just enough to keep them happy with the 300.  So, the real key to this mess is to make sure that they know and SEE that you are actually pennyless.  Without any means whatsoever.'

And, if the person you hit doesnt have any pictures of his or her vehicle and your vehicle, or any of your insurance information or drivers liscence number, then you shouldnt have anything to worry about. if you type up or write a letter and have him or her sign it then you are pretty much writing your own guilt on paper. therefor if that person does decide to take you to court, you have a piece of paper that you and the other individual signed confirming that you hit him or her. not recommended. just pay them the 300 and let it be. dont give them any information, personal information or insurance info. i hope that i answered your question. if you want more advice let me know and ill see what i can do.|`|CfLVmB9Paa	RECEIPT                                      (Specific)                        The undersigned hereby acknowledges the receipt of          _____________($              ) Dollars from __________________          in full payment, satisfaction and discharge of the obligation          dated _____________,19__ which is more particularly described          as follows:                        Signed and sealed this ______day of ______, 19__.       ______________________________         _________________________          Witness|`|dyIyJqauaa	Reach deeply into your pockets.

It's cheap ($40 to $100) and easy (direct fit) . Keep in mind the Tib's after 03 had 18mm bars so focus on finding 03 Tibs.

Well then try some clear headlights (ebay) and for the shine, don't waste money on a new paint job. On the paint use Nu Finish polish or Liquid Glass (amazon).

GbZ4axroaa	No it wont blow the subs but it wont sound as good with that amp you should go with a rockford fosgate p1500 it will run them to the max.|`|AA12046543	That amp will not blow those subs.  You have pretty good subs, and a cheap amp, no offense.  You should never cheap out on the amp, its the most important thing in the system, probably more important than the subs.  You probably got it because you thought it pushed out a lot of power for the money, compared to other higher end brands, but what ppl dont know is...    These brands overrate their amps to sell more, and they will NOT push out as much power as they say they do.  Heres a easy way to tell..  find the fuse size.  Multiply it by 10.  that is the rough estimate of how much power you are really getting.  if there is 2 fuses on the amps, add them.  This is your proof! So try to get a better amp, and pay a little more if you want it to sound a LOT better!|`|xtOjABiGaa	Yes it will handle it. But like a few people have said you really need to get a good quality amp. Any amp that is cea-compliant;meaning that that amp as been tested and rated for what it states.|`|mA9hvZonaa	yep.           so go put them in right now

BgwTxzEFaa	A problem with your ignition switch.|`|8ifKojOXaa	The next time that happens try pulling over safely then shutting the engine off and  jiggling the the ignition switch and turning it from the Aux to the run position. Be sure you keep trying the stereo's off and on switch as you do this.   If you hear the cd player kick on and off as you're jiggling the ignition switch or hear the beeping noises while doing this then you know that the ignition is the cause of the problem.   A question for you did you hit a bump at all when the cd player did this bec besides the ignition switch have a bad connection internally it could be a bad wire or bad ground going to the ignition switch too.So you might want to have the cd player running as your  parked idling and trace the wiring harness's wires and gently tug on each indiviual wire to see if the problem is in the ignition feed circuit.   It is also possible that the stereo system has a bad connection so check it's wiring too bec a sudden drop in voltage due to the cd player going off could off caused the main comp to send the signal to the beeper system.So be sure you check the stereo's ground and the ignition ground especially.         Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way check with the dealership bec that type of problem could be a factory recall issue too.   Note the guy with the brake paddle stereo issue should try to isolate the stereo's ground and make up a whole new ground for it.|`|I3V0siaGaa	ignition switch problems i have a similar problem but my stereo turns off when i push the brake pedal    what type of car do you drive ? is it a chevy?
3yvuMkzTaa	You can wire the ones with a cigarette lighter power source into your fuse block. I had this done with XM radio at best-buy. Took about an hour, the guy hid all wires, & did a very nice job, cost about $65!!!|`|dRozk0cCaa	yeah you just need the cigarette lighter adapter which is 10 bucks and just power it up through your fuse box and just run the wire for the gps than you'll be set.
6xyeYjkkaa	There may well be.
xtOjABiGaa	That is a great setup. The Comp 12's are SVC subs, Single Voice Coil which are 150rms apiece each giving you 300rms. So the guy who answered first is wrong. You need to wire them like this to get 300x1@ 2ohm which the amp gives.http://akamaipix.crutchfield.com/ca/lear...|`|mA9hvZonaa	yes.|`|WKvIkH2eaa	ok well to be honest i would upgrade that amp seriously. not sure how much money you are working with here but some suggestions are...    1) http://www.crutchfield.com/p_2064SX6002/...   its about $300 but its a good one    or if you want a cheaper one    2) http://www.crutchfield.com/p_489AP1000/P...   its about $130 but it wont last you as long as your kicker, rockford fosgate would      and as for wiring u have to take your power wire coming from the battery that has a fuse no more than 18'' away from the amp connected to the amp. take your ground wire from your amp and obviously ground it. take your remote wire that is connected to your head unit and connect it to your amp. and then wire the subs to the amp as they say positive to positive and negative to negative.
Gn0nR2S1aa	It very well could be a fuse that blew. Might be the motor as well. Could even be just a broken linkage arm in wiper system.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Could be a fuse, the switch, the motor, or a wiring issue.    Or all of the above.  I would check the fuse first.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Try this, where the motor is, loosen a screw or nut that attaches the motor, run a 12 guage blck wire to the screw that holds it on, then attach the other end to the neg side of the battery, if it works, its a neg short, leave it there, if not, the motor may be gone.|`|mxSffuuUaa	you should check your fuse, your car should have extra ones in the fuse box so locate which fuse is which and were the extra matching fuse is (should say on the cover of box) and replace it and try your windshield if it doesn't work then its more th an likely the motor.|`|f1XknLakaa	After checking the fuse & the wires you should take out the motor and test it directly, put the red wire to the plus side of the battery and use the negative wire on the negative side of the battery. Use extra wires for this procedure!  I have a question? Does your wiper motor work intermittently if so, that could be part of the problem.

That isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a sports or even a sporty car. The Taurus was built from intro to demise as a family car.

I think I'd check with a few other insurance companies.|`|u0lRzaXSaa	I have owned 2 BMWs of the same model as your 525 and as old as the car is getting, the insurance premium should be very close to the premium for the Ford.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Yes, expect to pay more.  A Taurus is Absolutely not a sports car and if I were you, I would look into that because if they have it rated as such, you have been paying excess premiums and may be due a refund.|`|FlqyJxMraa	For automobile insurance the best way to get a great quote is do a policy comparison on auto policies.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	The door ajar switches are located at the bottom of the door latches.  If you open the door, if you look down the inside edge of the door, maybe 8 inches below the door handle, you will see the opening for the door latch in the door.  Spray a lubricant such as WD-40 into each latch opening about 5 seconds each.  Open and close each door about 8-10 times each to work the lube into the door ajar switches.  The interior lamp should go out.  The door ajar switches are mounted at the bottom of the door latches and they collect dirt and grime, which makes them stick, lubing usually takes care of the problem.|`|UYTdVcDkaa	I believe you wil find that your door ajar switch is incorporated into your door latch.  Before you take in for repair, try this:  Get a can of WD40 or some other type of light penetrating oil.  Spray all four door latch mechanisms on the side of the door then open and close your doors 2 or 3 times.  If that doesn't remedy your problem, you'll have to go to a repair shop to determine which latch is gorked.
