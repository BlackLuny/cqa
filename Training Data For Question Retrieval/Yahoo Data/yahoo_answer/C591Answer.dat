Although I've had my share of males who seem threatened as soon as you get even close to that area, so I wouldn't consider it a "golden rule".    I've also known some girls who actually put their finger tip on the uethera (is that what it's called?); the opening at the tip of the head of the penis; this prevents a messy external ejaculation, but can also hurt the male oif the pressure is "reversed" and shifted back inwards! So a word to the wise; don't do it!    Plus, some girls just don't know how to do about the scrotum/an*s stimulation... All men aren't the same; while some will appear to want you to shove your whole hand up there in one swift stroke, others will prefer if you gently massage the balls or tha an*s, gently...    It's all a question of personnal preferences... As for myself, wll that's another story!|`|dd3f6232f15699b5907b3dc0bb1ff5f0aa	well it iz up his bum lol!

AA11643748	Men don't develop breast tissue, but they do have nipples.  All humans at one point in time are a woman.  It all depends if the Y chromosome is present or not.  If it is, the body sends out testosterone changing the woman to a male.  The organs "down there" change to male organs, but the nipples just stay where they are.  So in a sence, men have nipples because women have them.|`|4b51cebeda0e7cff2818fb60660376b5aa	cuz we feel like it|`|38901935b69478fade2ebb679fe33d9aaa	when a baby is first developing in the whomb it is female, so nipples grow, after that the baby will either become a male or stay female... thus meaning males and females have nipples because all males used to be female, after that its all up to hormones, female hormones cause breasts to grow etc, and males hormones cause lots of hair etc

When I was 14, it was easilly 2 to 3 times a day, sometimes more!    Masturbation Frequency:  http://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1...    How often does the average male masturbate?  It depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers  maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate  even happily married men.    I think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?  It is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/artic...    How can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?  It's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it.

My suggestion is that you replace the junk food with some healthier alternatives (such as carrots and popcorn without much butter) so that you can still have things around to much on.     Oh, keep one or two of your favorite junk food around as a special treat. It works better when you can satisfy the craving in moderation.     Hope this helps!

b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	Well, ha ha you are asking a difficult question. I had both my children with a cesarean section and I had hysterectomy. I think  the hysterectomy was by far more painful. I want to stress the point that people differ in their reaction to pain, some suffer terribly from an injection and some can endure even a root job without anesthesia. So you might be anyone of the two or somewhere in between. I think you need to accept the fact that the first couple of days after the hysterectomy are painful, very painful. You will probably get medication to ease the pain. The convalescent time is anything between 2-6 weeks, again depending on the endurance of your pain etc. Don't rush and don't feel you HAVE to be brave and do things. Let nature and your body get slowly back to normal. If you want to ask me more, do not hesitate to email me. Good luck.|`|e56f4af0392a97bead7ec4a8be859bbaaa	http://www.4woman.gov/faq/hysterectomy.h...    Hysterectomy    What is a hysterectomy?   How common are hysterectomies?   How is a hysterectomy performed?   How long does it take to recover from a hysterectomy?   Why do women have hysterectomies?   Are there any risks?   Can a hysterectomy lower my sexual desire?   Do options other than a hysterectomy exist?   What should I do if I am told that I need a hysterectomy?   If my cervix was removed in my hysterectomy, do I still need to have Pap tests?   See also...  Endometriosis   Uterine Fibroids   What is a hysterectomy?  A hysterectomy is an operation to remove a woman's uterus (womb). The uterus is where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. In some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes also are removed. These organs are located in a womans lower abdomen (see image below). The cervix is the lower end of the uterus.  The ovaries are organs that produce eggs and hormones. The fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.     Image Source: National Cancer Institute  There are several types of hysterectomies:  Complete or total. Removes the cervix as well as the uterus. (This is the most common type of hysterectomy.)   Partial or subtotal. Removes the upper part of the uterus and leaves the cervix in place.   Radical. Removes the uterus, the cervix, the upper part of the vagina, and supporting tissues. (This is done in some cases of cancer.)   Often one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed at the same time a hysterectomy is done.  If you haven't reached menopause (when you haven't had a period for 12 months in a row), a hysterectomy will stop your monthly bleeding (periods). You also won't be able to get pregnant. And you may have menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. If both ovaries are removed as well, you will suddenly enter menopause.  How common are hysterectomies?  A hysterectomy is the second most common surgery among women in the United States. (The most common is cesarean section delivery.) Each year, more than 600,000 are done. One in three women in the United States has had a hysterectomy by age 60.  How is a hysterectomy performed?  Hysterectomies are done through a cut in the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy) or the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy). Sometimes an instrument called a laparoscope is used to help see inside the abdomen during vaginal hysterectomy. The type of surgery that is done depends on the reason for the surgery. Abdominal hysterectomies are more common and usually require a longer recovery time.  How long does it take to recover from a hysterectomy?  Recovering from a hysterectomy takes time. You will stay in the hospital from one to two days for postsurgery care. Some women may stay in the hospital up to four days.  Abdominal. Complete recovery usually takes four to eight weeks. You will gradually be able to increase your activities.  Vaginal or laparoscopic. Most women are able to return to normal activity in one to two weeks.  For both, by the sixth week, you should be able to take tub baths and resume sexual activities.  Why do women have hysterectomies?  Hysterectomy is used to treat:  Fibroids. More hysterectomies are done because of fibroids than any other problem of the uterus. For many women with fibroids, symptoms are minimal and require no treatment. Also, the fibroids often shrink after menopause. But fibroids can cause heavy bleeding or pain in some women.  Endometriosis. This happens when the tissue lining the inside of your uterus grows outside the uterus on your ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other pelvic or abdominal organs. When medication and surgery do not cure endometriosis, a hysterectomy often is performed.   Uterine prolapse. This is when the uterus moves from its usual place down into the vagina. This can lead to urinary problems, pelvic pressure, or difficulty with bowel movements.  Cancer. If you have cancer of the uterus, cervix, or ovary a hysterectomy may be part of the treatment your doctor recommends.  Persistent vaginal bleeding. If your periods are heavy, not regular, or last for many days each cycle and nonsurgical methods have not helped to control bleeding, a hysterectomy may bring relief.   Chronic pelvic pain. Surgery is a last resort for women who have chronic pelvic pain that clearly comes from the uterus. However, many forms of pelvic pain aren't cured by a hysterectomy, and so this approach can be a permanent mistake.   Are there any risks?  A hysterectomy involves some major and minor risks. Most women do not have problems during or after the operation. Some risks include:  Heavy blood loss, that requires blood transfusion   Bowel injury   Bladder injury   Anesthesia problems (such as breathing or heart problems)   Need to change to abdominal incision during surgery   Wound pulling open   Can a hysterectomy lower my sexual desire?  Women who have had a hysterectomy, in which one or both ovaries are removed, can have lowered sexual desire and decreased pleasure and orgasm. If you have problems with sexual desire or functioning, talk to your doctor.  Do options other than a hysterectomy exist?  If you have cancer, a hysterectomy might be the only option. But if you have uterine fibroids, endometriosis or uterine prolapse, there are other treatments you can try first.  Drug therapy. Certain medications may lighten heavy uterine bleeding or correct uterine bleeding that is not regular. Certain medications can help with endometriosis.   Endometrial ablation. If you have heavy or irregular uterine bleeding, this procedure might ease your symptoms. With a special device, a

Your diet should consist of dark leafy vegatables. Keep fruit to a minium even tho there good for they contain alot of simple sugars.

Keep your protein high with lean meats such as fish and chicken and of course keep fat, salt ,sugar, carbs and calories to all time low .

My thoughts are to put it in your workout. Do exercises that target your abs. Putting them in your workout will also get them out of the way while you are doing everything else. Also if you do your strength training then do abs at another part of the day, it may take up the time for you to rest. You must rest because that's when your workout takes effect. Muscles grow when you're resting. You can do a separate ab workout, but do the ab workouts the same time you do everything else. I do mine after I'm finished my other exercises.   Anyway, you must do abs so they keep their strength up to stay adapted with every other muscles.|`|mjKaAONqaa	ummm... there is never no good time to get abs or not, do your daily excersices so you muscles won't get sore.  oh and guys in their swim truck while at the beach is really hot-only if they're fit, musclely, and have abs.    try doing 50 sit-ups each day...??|`|pwkeo7tTaa	Yes you should do a separate routine that targets only your abs.  50 or so sit ups without weights and then 30 or so sit ups with a dumbbell on your chest for resistance.

Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.

AA11140808	I had panic attacks.  The kind where I thought I would die.  I hated them, I got so nervous that I got dizzy and then my heart would beat faster.  I went to a therapist and she said I needed to work.  I  got a job and within 3 months I was fine.  When one sits and thinks only of their self it just builds more and more in their mind.  I took Xanax for awhile, but I got off that, too.  The best thing is to stay busy and not think of yourself so much and stay with people.  Talk things out with a professional.

zFgYvteAaa	The pyramid method is used to maintain strength when you are playing a sport.   Doing only 15kg for a bench press ins't exactly going to make your chest bigger. First I would suggest being able to lift more weight before you started worrying about how big your chest is going to get. Gaining muscle takes time. You might want to look for bodybuilding websites and seeing how many sets and reps the professionals use to get bigger if you are really interested.  I gained 100 lbs on my bench press in less than a year by doing:                    (sets x reps)  Week 1:    10,8,6   Week 2:     3x3  Week 3:     5x5  Week 4:     5,4,3,2,1    I like switching week 2 with week 3 because it makes maxing out the next week easier, but i never did that until recently.    Doing lat pulls, flies, bicep, and tricep work will also help increase the bench press.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	That sound pretty good, in the past, I've been taught that the pyramid method of lifting was the best way to add bulk and strength.|`|Vsga7eivaa	Well the best way to make your chest bigger is to shock your muscles into growth.  The ideal way of doing this is:  3-4 sets  of  10-15 reps.    So you want to hardly be able to lift the weight on the last rep in each set.  This is why it is much better if you have somebody to spot you, or you use the seated bench press machine.  Make sure when you get to the end of each set you can't lift anymore.  If you can lift it easily, put on more weight.
Z6Nuz5I1aa	Unfortunately, when it comes to kidney disease and treatment options dialysis is usually the end of the road. If transplantion is an option then it should definitely be considered--he should put his name on the list pronto. In the mean time, life on dialyisis while challenging, can be tolerable and fit in with one's schedule. I personally go to college with a woman who is on hemodialysis. However, she does this at home, so she has more freedom...On the other side of the spectrum, my father attends dialysis 3 days a week for 4 hours. It is the only thing keeping him alive (his kidney problems are related to Type 2 Diabetes).     Lastly, one of the best things your friend can do is focus on his diet so that he does not further stress his kidneys. A renal diet consists of fluid, potassium, sodium, and phosphourous restrictions, and in some cases protein considerations. He should speak with a registered dietitian (RD) on how to best follow this diet while he his undergoing treatment.     Here are some useful links regarding kidney disease, renal diets, and how to find a RD.   http://www.kidney.org/atoz/atozItem.cfm?...  http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/p...  http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada...

It's all vanity.|`|9644988c9446b90452576af3df488ffbaa	To be honest, not all women look good being natural.  I think moderation is the key, there are women who don't need almost any makeup, but there are some that really need it to look good.  The problem is that sometimes they take it too far and end up looking like porn stars.  About breast enlargement, I never like them but I say that because I got a good size, I'm sure if I were a AA I wouldn't think the same way.  But if I were a man, the more natural a woman looks the more you know how beautiful she really is.

qRLQjoqhaa	yes, if you do not get enough sleep you can gain weight. this is because when your asleep alot of your body shuts down. one of these if the function to eat. this is why if you have 12 hours sleep you are not starving. if you missed 12 hours in the day you would be hungary. when you sleep also, in the subconsious state you tend to lose a lot of skin, you relly wouldn't be able to grasp how much. however if you are awake most of the day you don't lose so much skin. that's why if you weigh your self before you go to bed and when you wake up there will be a slight difference. if getting little sleep is an ongoing thing then the weight can make a difference.     sleep can also effect your complexion. little sleep will resolve in the likelyhood of gettinf a lot of spots, black heads greasy skin etc. this is because while sleeping because a lot of you bodies functions have shut down you body can focus on other things. one of these things is cooling down your internal body, not so that you get cold but it helps things like spots. it sort of cleans the inside of your body, so that all you've got to do is wash the outside    also if you are awake a lot of the time your body gets little rest resulting in grumpyness and headaches, other parts of your body can ache to, especially your eyes.    one thing that may shock you, a wide spread global survey was undertaken a few years ago and it was found that if you have little sleep you are more lightly to get a heart related disease. it is adviced that you get atleast 8 hours sleep to keep your body healthy. remember that is the minimum, the more sleep the better    good luck  chris|`|5I2iPYvQaa	Thats a really good question, i been wondering that myself. I heard the more you sleep the better.|`|1uBZWClbaa	There are no requirements for the body to get certain number of sleep. Everything depends on your sleep cycle. It consist of 90 minutes which is 60 minutes when you fall asleep, 20 actually sleeping and dreaming and 10 minutes when the brain is waking up... Your cycle extends each cycle you sleep. If you will get up in those 10 minutes when your brain wakes up you'll be very rest. If you will wake up with alarm clock in the middle of 20 minutes while you are dreaming you will feel tired through the whole day ! So only you have to do just find the top of your cycle those 10 minutes. You have to go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time... You will feel rest even if you will sleep just couple hours... you just have to experience with your sleep cycle

vxtZGQNOaa	Hi!  I've beenin dentistry for over 25 years and they work fine.  Here's a few tips to make them work better.    Don't brush before you use because most toothpastes have fluoride and this will reduce the efffectiveness of the peroxide.  When you remove trays just spit or rinse very lightly.  Wait for 10 minutes.  Then brush gently with you own fluoride toothpaste.  For 1 hour after do not drink tea, coffee, eat berries or wine.  Anything that stains.    Follow the directions, and once your teeth are whitened, use once or twice a month for touch-ups.  That will keep your smile nice and bright and not over do it!  If you have any other questions, please ask.   Marie.|`|MAB3yIMSaa	Hm, you've seen them on comercials huh?  Well, i don't use it.  But i use Crest Whitening Strips.  And they're 30 bucks.

When you do masturbate try to delay ejaculation as long as possible.  It will take sometime but eventually you will learn to control and delay your orgasm.  Avoid things that sexually stimulates you until you learned to control yourself. Remember it is normal to masturbate, just dont over do it.  Little advice, Wait until you are ready to have sex.

9748a7acce5be41016d0527bc8625942aa	People usually get veiny arms when they are a bit on the thinner side.     Increased appearance of veins comes in people who train more as there is an increased need for blood to get to respiring cells to provide oxygen. This regular increased bloodflows causes the arteries and veins to stretch out, particularly the arteries that have naturally more flexible walls.   ^^Which means you play a lot of sports and you have a slim body type.    Body fat also plays a role in the amount the vessels can be seen.  ^^You might be thin.    http://www.fightingarts.com/ubbthreads/s...

0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day. Nothing other than water in between. Include plenty of uncooked vegetables and fruits in each meal, preferably 50%. Chew each morsel at least 32 times to activate ur body to generate signals of hunger/fullness. Obey these signals.

Hmm,,,I would try to advice u against being lazy bout exercising but I'll try to accommodate you. I'd say you try eating celery sticks instead of the usual junk food for snacks. I'd also recommend a daily jog before you work or before you eat dinner (helps to improve blood circulation, keeps you fit and builds up an appetite). If a jog is not up to ur taste then try swimming. If the worst come to the worst, I'd advice sit-ups and push-ups to keep fit.

Aerobics, jogging, and even just long walks are great.    Try not to eat candy, sweets, and junk food.  Avoid anything that looks like it should be fatty and is marked low fat.  Avoid anything hydrogenated.  Avoid artificial sweeteners.  For beverages, avoid soda and anything you can see through (unless it is water).  Replace butter and margarine with cream cheese where possible.  Remember that fat consumption does not mean fat accumulation, at least not any more than other sources of calories.    Eat lots of fiber, salad, vegetables, whole grains, fruits, etc.  Try to eat fresh made meals whenever possible.    When you do eat junk food, do not eat directly out of the bag.    Most important, do not starve yourself.|`|pnynoAQmaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

Also, I don't know what your eating habits are, but it certainly wouldn't hurt for me to tell you that portion is everything. Instead of eating a whole candy bar, eat half of one, hell, eat HALF of everything you eat and you will never have a weight problem.Drink 8 - 10 glasses of water a day, green tea is very good for your body as an antioxidant and help subtly speed up the metabolism. Salads (without fatty dressings and cheese) are very good for you, chicken is the king of meat in my opinion, as long as you don't fry it. Avoid fast food entirely, and walk anywhere you can as often as possible and buy a 10 minute tae bo dvd on ebay. Drink diet sodas and juices (aka - cherry coke zero, sobe lean, crystal light, etc.) avoid sugar, switch to the 100 calorie snack packs, including popcorn. Eat apples, they are very filling! Cheese is an unecessary evil as well, so is milk, if you have to have it, drink the fat free kind. 100 calorie popcorn is a great snack. Eat turkey lunchmeat instead of a whole sandwich, etc. Eating is necessary, over eating is not. I also have a meal shake in place of a meal, I find it incredibly helpful at 3:00 in the afternoon.

7623Hd7naa	There's not enough info to really break it down for you, and I'm not sure how accurate your 1000 calories a day you think you are eating is, but that's a start. Assuming you really are eating only 1000 calories a day, it's not enough. 1200 is the recommended minimum for women. When you eat under that, your metabolism can slow down and your body can go into starvation mode. <br>  <br>  Exercising regularly(including weight training), and eating 5-6 small healthy meals a day will help jumpstart your metabolism. There's plenty of research online that will help you learn more about this.|`|tIldpr7vaa	you need more cardio, walking isnt good exercise to burn fat. U need to jog and run. The more u exert urself and the more effort it takes, the more fat you'll burn. Walking takes very little effort.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Get a real good looking personal trainer.

It might sound backwards, but you need more calories.  1000 per day is so small for someone active that it causes your metabolism to slow down.  Now I'm not saying to pig out, but you should eat 4-5 times a day of 300-400 calories, including protein in each meal.  Keep the sugar low and the veggies high.  Also don't consume soft drinks (not even diet) or juice of any kind - just lots of water, or green tea.  Also try to stop eating around 8 or 9 - you will sleep better and you will slowly lose any excess weight.|`|zz6VcUewaa	believe it or not its because your eating to little calories. if your eating 1,000 calories a day thats not enough because you need atleast 1,200. Your body will go in starvation mode if you dont eat enough. You should eat around 1,400 because you do a lot of exercise. but eat 5 small meals a day and not three big ones. this will make your metobolism faster but make sure your getting enough calories cuz that is also a big thing. and you should lose weight that way.|`|G1OSlub8aa	Eat smaller meals throughout the day...5 will do the trick. This will help increase your metabolism into working better throughout the day.|`|ZWDQbfN0aa	There are green tea pills (you can find them at vitamin stores) and they have the same antioxidants as green tea, which speeds up your metabolism. I haven't taken them, but I've heard from people that have and they say the pills work.<br>  You can also strength train and lift weights (not to get buff, just to tone up) and this will increase your metabolism and help you burn fat. You seem to work out a lot so there's not much you can do.

IKakoOfyaa	It has been many years ago for me, and admission requirements may vary depending on the school you choose, but you should definitely take biology and chemistry, english for all four years, algebra and geometry (or algebra II) and two years of a foreign language.  That plus a GPA of at least 3.0 will almost certainly gain you admission into any RN program or in cases where spots are limited and admission is competitive, a good chance of admission.|`|eg0aD3Vdaa	For starters.. take your  math, and science classes all four years. <br>  Make sure you have a math class your senoir year too.. they look for that.<br>  See if you school has extra electives like medical assisting, or health programs. thats a plus. <br>  Also, AP Biology or AP Chem are good choices to go advance. Especially if you want to go into nursing school those kind of things make them want to except you. <br>  Then you'll sure be ready for R.N!
5VdIhM8yaa	I had two baby girls and thanks God I never had morning sickness.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	When i was prego w/ my son, i never threw up! I felt nauseated every once in a while. mainly in the a.m. <br>  Although, when my bff was prego w/ her first daughter, she was always sick. Then on her second pregnancy she said she never felt sick, only nauseated every once in a while, but it turned out to be a girl too!<br>  I think it depends on the pre-natals you take & your diet. <br>  GL!!|`|y8HyP1bzaa	These are just old wives tales!  It has nothing to do with the sex of your baby.|`|ZDdUSL2Naa	As far as I know the sex isnt determined until la bit later in pregnancy.

Nothing is wrong with having money because if everyone became poor, then there would just be more poor people in the wold. You sound like an excellent candidate for volunteering. You should check out charitynavigators.com if you know of a cause that you are interested in, then find out how you can help. There are also missions and websites with international volunteer services eg. volunteerinternational.org. or peacecorps..<br>  <br>   I can relate to you because I am an avid campaigner for the poor. Currently on my school bagpack I have puff painted " stop genocide, savedarfur.org" and I am in college. You can start a group at your school or raise money to help those in need. Darling there are so many things to do and not enough people willing to do it and you should be proud of yourself for your concern. Be proud of you family, because many like myself, wish we had all that you had. But don't be ashamed of what you have just use it to help others. Continue being compassionate, it is a wonderful trait. All the best.

ewswVOrTaa	I agree with the above, he is very lucky to have you.<br>  <br>  I am in the same position he, too takes Nytol (and Kalms!) and even though he has always been what I would call a bit "stressy", it is getting a lot worse.<br>  <br>  I've been with him for 16 years and have seen this come and go, all you can do is listen (if he wants to talk) and try not to add any extra stress into the situation.  If the washing machine breaks down and you get a huge mobile phone bill, keep it to yourself.  Even if you have PMS.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most males will not admit they can't cope.  In my experience, the first way to break him down is to (if he likes a beer or two) get him drunk at the weekend and say something like "We haven't had much fun since you have had this job, wouldn't you enjoy doing something else more?" - then stand back and let the fireworks go.  He will blow at some point - this is more controlled from your point of view and yes, it will all be directed at you but you just have to be strong!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, you sound like really good support for him.|`|S3eWfTqvaa	Have you tried 'rocking his world' every night - 2 things that might ruin it though, you being the type to make him do all the work (in the bedroom) or you becoming pregnant....<br>  <br>  Another issue might be if he is the sole breadwinner in the house, he might feel obligated to that job or else "everything would come crashing down". Men sometimes have that feeling since the burden is usually placed on the man to work.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	He's a lucky boy to have you!|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Hi Miss Elisha,<br>  First of all, well done to you for wanting to help your boyfriend become less stressed. Many women don't notice when their man is feeling under pressure. <br>  You seem to be doing everything you can but could I suggest a massage. You could do a full massage to include neck and shoulders, back legs and arms, or you could just do a shoulder or foot or hand massage depending on how tired he is. You can buy bottles of ready made massage oil or you could make your own up using a good quality Olive Oil and two or three drops of lavender essential oil ( get a decent essential oil). (You will need about 30 to 50 mils of olive oil to do the full massage.) Keep well away from all 'private' areas unless he specifically requests that you work there, so as not to put further pressure on him to perform if you get what I'm saying.<br>  Let him have his warm bath before hand, then massage and if he is still awake, get him a hot chocolate. Don't worry about him taking the nytol for now - his stresses are obviously causing him to have disturbed sleep. You will probably find that he falls asleep whilst you are massaging him, so work on your bed and if he does fall asleep you just need to wrap him up warm.<br>  Also do not worry about the physical side to your relationship for now, that will all sort itself out as the stress reduces. If his symptoms continue for longer than a month then perhaps he would be better seeing his doctor just to check that there is nothing underlying that is adding to his concerns.<br>  I hope this helps in some way and that your boyfriend is soon feeling more relaxed and in control. Good luck to you both, you really do sound like a lovely caring person and I wish you both a long and happy future.|`|ParFJxnSaa	See stress treatments, at ezy build, below, in section 42. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.

g8pRhElsaa	despite popular opinion, going through puberty does NOT make you moody. hormones would only make you moody if you're about to start your period that month. i really think moms just made this up to help figure out their teenage kids!<br>  <br>  it sounds to me like you're just a normal stressed-out teenager. we all go through this, and i'm sorry you don't have someone to listen to you. you should definitely find a good friend or family member who you can vent to - it helps a ton!<br>  <br>  if this continues for a while, i would see a shrink. they are someone who you can vent to, and they're really good at shedding some insight into all of this. plus, if you did end up having some kind of depression (which is getting fairly common in teens), they can help you deal with that.<br>  <br>  hope you start feeling better!<br>  <br>  p.s. with the tiredness, it's just because you're needing TONS of sleep right now because you're an adolescent. most teens don't get enough sleep, so just try to catch up on the weekends and attempt to keep going to bed at a regular time or maybe even a little earlier|`|rchaTSI9aa	I'm guessing it's just hormones. I have very similar things happening to me, and whenever I try to tell someone about it, they just sort of say "Oh... maybe it'll be better tomorrow", or something like that and then change subject.

It happens a lot when you're about to get your period actually.|`|7Rs2z1UIaa	sweetie, I have to agree with RC. I don't believe it's just hormones. Yes, hormones can play a part in our feelings of well-being but that doesn't mean it's the only thing that could be going on.<br>  As an ex-sufferer of severe pre-menstral and menstral problems, I can tell you that your symptoms are not what I would consider normal hormonal problems. <br>  More than likely, there's some stress and anxiety going on and you're becoming depressed. The reason I say this is because I've been dealing with depression for more years than I care to think on. My own symptoms very closely match yours. My best advice sweetheart, is to find a trusted adult and bring them this list of your symptoms, including the crying and fatigue. If one person will not listen or take you seriously, go to another. Don't give up. Get yourself in to see your doctor as soon as you can if possible. Doctors can be very good about taking our feelings and pains seriously and helping us feel better.<br>  Good luck dear and don't give up. In the meantime, here is a lovely little book to help understand depression so you can see that you are not strange, odd or weird.

pW16KBlqaa	Yeah definitely. Keep in mind though that it'll be around 4 lbs a week, and that's a little quick to lose the weight so a realistic goal would be 3 lbs a week. However, if you're really determined to lose that amount of weight in that time, keep your calories around 1,000 and do at least 30 mins of intense cardio everyday, an hour preferably. It's up to you if you want to add strength training to that. <br>  <br>  It's VERY hard to stick to around 1,000 calories and exercise that much, but if you can do it, you'll most likely lose the weight you want to. And as long as you're taking a multivitamin and eating healthy (and I mean healthy, no junk food at all), you'll have lots of energy. And no, this isn't one of those starvation diets to those who think it is. It also doesn't hurt to incorporate green tea into your diet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KuTvjFvoaa	Lets do the math here. This means that you must lose about 4 pounds in each week. That goal is way to high. Try to lose about 2 pounds in each week because it is said that faster you lose the weight the fast it will come back. In 6 weeks you would burn about 12 pounds which isn't too bad. Check this video out, if you follow it you will surely lose weight.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	You probably could, but most people who go on crash diets lose, then gain it all back, with extra, and then struggle even harder to lose it again later. <br>  <br>  Don't set yourself a time - oriented goal.

Friends who have tried stuff like that usually get really bad headaches for a while, that's the typical side effect one gets from taking them.

bP960sWXaa	First have them cleaned, examined and checked for cavities. Then once all of the extra cement and buildup have been removed wait another week to make sure the gum swelling that you may have had due to the brackets is gone. Then whiten them with a whitener ----     Read this post I sent to someone else...     can say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the Crest Whitestrips, some more than others. Our office uses the Supreme which are 4 times stronger than what you can get in the store, but the others will work as well but take more time and possibly more than one kit. The results are usually pretty quick, noticeable in the first few days, best in a week or longer.If you can, do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup (tartar, plaque, or orthodontic cement) will impede their ability to work. They will not whiten any white fillings you may have, but whiten uniformly. Also, don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on (same reason). You should not drink or eat anything dark for at least 1/2 hour after using the strips.   The strips/trays are your least costly whitening method as compared to custom made trays or in office whitening ($500.00+) All of the methods (strips, trays, custom trays, in office whitening) have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive, but will not harm the enamel. If you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste. You might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke. Most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective. Whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life, as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again.     Good luck!

6e4e5ab6816e9787c2ec91b3e8468c3aaa	I suggest that you go ahead and get the shot.  Your doctor is very familiar with the anatomy of your scapula and knows exactly where the bursa is.  Usually, they use very, very thin needles, which do not hurt when they go in. There is some discomfort from the injection -- it feels a little like someone is gently blowing up a balloon underneath your scapula -- but the sensation will go away with a few hours.  Considering how much pain relief you may get, it's worth a little discomfort.|`|oqcjAMJQaa	My mom had to get a cortisone shot in her shoulder.

u3TDayHJaa	Katrina,  Do NOT diet.  Dieting at your age when it isn't necessary can really mess up your growth (bones) and your development (breasts, reproductive system).      I looked on a height and weight chart for a woman of 4'11" and you don't even touch the minimum weight.  It's hard to tell how much you should weigh right now since you are only 13, but you certainly do not need to lose.      What is pressuring you to diet?  Our society is full of images of starved, skinny girls.  They look terrible.  Don't join them.    Eat three good meals a day, skipping junk food.  You'll be fine.

a5MzSF5qaa	OK. Look at your diet. Cut out some sugars and fats, your body does not need a lot of them to be fine. Protein is important because your body uses it to build muscles and make hormones and because it takes your GI tract a long time to break it down, it fills you up for a while. Carbohydrates can be good and bad. Sugars are carbs, but they only give you energy for a short while, whereas pasta takes a long time to be broken down and is a good carb (I don't care what name-brand diets say). Veggies don't have a lot of calories, but the fiber fills you up and it's good source of vitamins and minerals. try to steam them, they're better for you that way. Exercise everyday. At least an hour. Try to keep your heart rate high for 30 min  at a time, that'll burn fat. Run, bicycle, play with the dog , I don't care but get out there and be busy. It'll help your metabolism along. Eat 5 smallish meals a day instead of 2 big ones. Don't eat anything for 2 hours before you go to bed, and if you have to eat something, eat something healthy with very few calories. Email me if you have questions.|`|YL1NQ8ntaa	I have found Taste of Home a good source of good tasting food.

I used to have type II Diabetes issues but now my blood sugar is consistently under 120 even sometimes after I eat. I created a ebook that teaches you how I went from a 500 blood sugar level down to under 120 in about 1.5 months. I don't take any medicine which I'm not saying that you shouldn't but I use natural things from the grocery store. One thing that you can do is drink water (4 cups) before you eat or brush teeth. Wait 15 minutes before you even brush. 45 minutes before you eat. Do this for at least 30 days. You should do it for the rest of your life. Lastly, eat mostly Salmon and fish with omega 3 fatty acids. You need to blend and drink vegetables and you will probably be able to lose weight quickly and keep from having type II Diabetes if you don't have it.

MPX0f5jzaa	Most likely.  I was on Accutane for three months and all of my symptoms went away.  They're pretty much the same thing, an ultra-high dosage of antibiotics and prescribed for the same purpose.

ZwNRGT1Laa	I took Loestrin Fe for about three months before quitting. I wouldn't say its effects were monumental, but they were noticable - breakouts took longer to clear up & my skin felt oiler than normal. Nothing huge to complain about, but not exactly desirable either. <br>  <br>  I also had a little bit of weight gain and felt bloated at times. My periods were nice, short, and easy though!
e9ny4oWEaa	Sometimes it's possible, it all depends on the serverity of the disorder.<br>  Schizophrenia runs high in my family. My aunt and one of my cousins have all suspected they have schizophrenia, but my grandmother and uncle never had a clue.<br>  If I were you, I would just go and ask a trusted friend or parent. Just ask them if you think [insert schizo symptom here] sounds like you.<br>  <br>  It'll be alright:) at least you're playing it safe by checking stuff out!|`|QsVMeaPXaa	It is easy to identify with  a lot of medical problems when you read about them. I went throug Nursing school and so many people always assumed they had a dread disease. :)<br>  <br>  If you aren't feeling well emotionally please seek out help.

Yourself!<br>  <br>  Anyways, you should see a pro to make sure, and perhaps get help.  My uncle has Schiz; he's awfully nice but the disorder itself can get REALLY bad.|`|1zgWUTXZaa	It depends on the individual, but there are people who are fully aware of their schizophrenia. However, just because you are exhibiting some symptoms does not necessarily mean that you do have it. If you have a lot of symptoms and they are happening frequently, you need to get to a doctor ASAP. If it appears to be pretty mild, I wouldn't worry too much, but you may still want to talk to your doctor or a psychologist to find out for sure.|`|DCnNSweXaa	More than likely you do not have Schizophrenia, the onset age is usually around 25 to 30 for females.  But it is one of the most common psychotic illnesses and usually has to be treated before the person can live a "normal" life.  But when the medication starts working and they are doing better that is when they get off their medication.  Most people know that something is wrong, but I would say this is not your problem and it effects more men than women.  If you have had a brain injury your chances are also greater, but it only effects like 2 in 2 million or something like that.  When you read about symptoms, you have to be careful, because anyone of us could fit some of the symptoms at one time or another.  You have not said much of what your symptoms are,but if you really think you do...Try to talk with a psychiatrist.  Hopefully, you are just a Hypochondriac.|`|3EDUhA39aa	sometimes they are, everyone's different. some people with mental illness can be very high-functioning and self-aware.<br>  see a psychiatrist to find out for sure!|`|AIwDdAKcaa	Absolutely. Regardless of the severity of the illness, people are capable of different levels of insight based on intelligence and many other factors.  The symptoms of schizophrenia are pretty hard to mistake, but often are so consuming that it is difficult to maintain enough objectivity to recognize.<br>  <br>  If you think you have a problem, don't hesitate to see a therapist.  Sites like psychologytoday.com allow you to search for professionals in your area by fee, insurance, gender, specialty etc.  Worth a shot.  Good luck!!

xzwZ3lt3aa	Have you had a recent x-ray done? A Dr should probably take a look, and decide. I do know that in a tib/fib break, they rarely set the fibula. The tibia is the main weight bearing bone ( 90% ) and the fib ( 10% ) I believe even though the fib was displaced, the gap will eventually fill in. I think what you're feeling is normal, but for peace of mind, maybe call the Dr who did the surgery and ask him.

ZWDQbfN0aa	As far as the crunches go, you breath in on your way up and out on your way down. In order to lose weight, eat 5-6 small meals a day, and do cardio every day.

Fat loss is hard and takes intense discipline and diligence. If it feels easy, it's because it isn't working. There are no shortcuts. You get out what you put in. If you try to lose weight with minimum involvement or effort, you'll get minimum results. <br>  <br>  The keyword in "workout" is "WORK". It's just as much mental as it is physical. The hardest part about losing fat/weight is the lifestyle change. The actual workouts are simple. Once you establish the courage and discipline to conquer your old, bad habits, you can accomplish anything you want.<br>  <br>  Google StrongLifts 5x5 and do it. You'll be amazed at the results in 3 months.

A PT would be able to diagnose your problem and if they found it was not a musculoskeletal problem they would refer your to a physician.

The problem will only get worse as you get older and i don't know about your grandmothers case but allot of patients who have discomfort after treatment are the ones you waited way to long to begin treatment. So my advise to you again take care of this problem now while you are young so you don't end up having to see a chiropractor the rest of your life. I'm a chiropractor who sees patients with similar symptoms as yours, we have a success rate.  Anyway if you don't trust the guy your grandmother sees go see someone else~ don't let that stop you from getting care.

There are unethical bunches in every profession and chiropractic is not immune to it just like medical profession isn't..    However, would you abandone medical field completely if your grandma had a bad experience with an MD???    Chiropractic does not have higher percentage of uneithcal doctors compared to other healthcare profession.    Sometimes it seems that way because out of  millions of patients who are helped by chiropractic every year, only the bad cases make it to newspaper due to sensationalism...    It's your choice though.  If you prefer to stay away from chiropractors altogether, then that's your choice.  However, you may be eliminating the only or best modality of treatment for you when you do that...    What I'd do if I were in your place is to find a chiropractic neurologist.  They are chiropractors with additional 3 years of postgrad training and they need to pass additional board to get their diplomate status...    It's always your choice...

4dr99XePaa	Oh Sadness...  Try to remember, life is full of peaks and valleys. You are going through a valley right now my friend. You and I have a few things in common. I also have a tendency to have one very close friend. She moved to CA and for 2 years now I haven't been able to replace her.  You get used to it. You find other ways to fill your time. You are young. You will meet other friends.  You just have to want to.  Sometimes you just have to tell yourself to do the things you know you have to do.  "Snap out of it!" That's what I tell myself when I know I am having a pity party. Give yourself some time them move on.  Things will get better. Keep your head up! xoxoxoxo|`|QBeCCJF4aa	You kinda can't get over it.  you just need to reassure yourself that your still going to talk to her.

CONGRATULATIONS!    After having been at the same school for 4 years; you've established a routine, and made acquaintances that you have become used to.  In the back of your mind you're realizing that there are some big changes to come.  Additionally, you're one good friend is moving away.  You are justified to feel emotional/sad/insecure.  If you have been used to speaking with your parents, this is a wonderful opportunity to become closer.  Talk to them:  let them know how you are feeling - that so many changes is such a short period of time is overwhelming.  If you don't feel comfortable doing this, speak with you HS counselor - believe it or not, they can be very helpful and understanding.    To help yourself, again, realize that you are not alone. Many teens feel this way after high school is over.  But slowly, do start to realize that as one experience has come to an end, an exciting new journey is about to begin!!  If you are going to a community college or local university, you will be so busy getting used to so many things, you probably won't have time to be sad.    As for your friend - just because he/she is moving away that doesn't mean that you can't communicate!  E-mail, Facebook, MySpace...telephone each other!  Distance does not have to end friendships (my best friend is in Germany, I'm in CA and after 20 years we still keep in touch!).    If you find yourself becoming more depressed (can't get up, no ambition, loss of pleasure in doing things you enjoy) please seek help.    Best of luck to you.|`|AA12120714	First you did a great thing by finishing high school that is so much to be proud of and happy about and I know your parents are thrilled for you too about your achievement in your education.  At the same time you are very sad from losing your dear friend.  At your age "friends" are everything to you. You live and breath your best friend and that is very normal nothing to be ashamed of. Then when they are taken away it's a very big "shock" you feel as if someone pulled the rug out from under your feet and you are lost....but that is part of life we cannot always control these things. It's a very hard thing to get over.   Can I suggest this....have a talk with your parents or one of them whichever you feel more comfortable with.  Explain the deep loss you feel and how much you need their understanding. I'm sure they will listen and be very thoughtful during this time of adjustment. We all have losses in our lives some more serious than others. You will survive this and move on to new friends and new things to do in your life. One thing you can do is join a social group in your city or school and become more active so you will be open to making more friends.   It would help you a lot but you are in control of this and you can make it happen.  My heart goes out to you, best wishes,  Mama Jazzy Geri
duVTqRM4aa	Ok, when yeast keeps coming back it usually means there is 1.) lack of good bacteria (probiotics) in the intestines. 2.) hidden infection (usually intestinal if not vaginal) 3.) Possibly too much mercury in your body.  For some reason mercury poisoning increases yeast.  4.) overuse of antibiotics.  First off you should get on some good probiotics.  Make sure the potency of live bacteria is guaranteed at the time of consumption.  Obviously wearing cotton underwear is ideal.  Also, I'd look into doing a liver cleanse and a colon cleanse.  There are websites I recommend on my page here or you can look at your local healthfood store.  Stay off of sugar and breads as much as possible.  No sodas either.  If you need some yeast do's and don'ts I'll provide a link below.

This illness, called Acute HIV Syndrome, may include fever, headache, tiredness, nausea, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes (organs of the immune system that can be felt in the neck, armpits and groin). These symptoms usually disappear within a week to a month and are often mistaken for another viral infection.    Later symptoms include:    Lack of energy   Weight loss   Frequent fevers and sweats   A thick, whitish coating of the tongue or mouth (thrush) that is caused by a yeast infection and sometimes accompanied by a sore throat   Severe or recurring vaginal yeast infections   Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or severe and frequent infections like herpes zoster   Periods of extreme and unexplained fatigue that may be combined with headaches, lightheadedness, and/or dizziness   Rapid loss of more than 10 pounds of weight that is not due to increased physical exercise or dieting   Bruising more easily than normal   Long-lasting bouts of diarrhoea   Swelling or hardening of glands located in the throat, armpit, or groin   Periods of continued, deep, dry coughing   Increasing shortness of breath   The appearance of discoloured or purplish growths on the skin or inside the mouth   Unexplained bleeding from growths on the skin, from mucous membranes, or from any opening in the body   Recurring or unusual skin rashes   Severe numbness or pain in the hands or feet, the loss of muscle control and reflex, paralysis or loss of muscular  strength   An altered state of consciousness, personality change, or mental deterioration   Children may grow slowly or fall sick frequently.

(Some people have flu like symptoms within a few months of being infected, but that is rare.) The only way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested. **Once someone is infected, they can transmit the virus to others, even if they have no symptoms.    HIV damages the immune system by killing the cells our bodies use to fight infections (CD4 cells).  When the CD4 count drops to 200 or less, the diagnosis changes from HIV to AIDS.  As that cell count drops, the person becomes more vulnerable to other infections, which they can then die from because their bodies can not fight them off.|`|sc6ufFfGaa	you should see a doctor.|`|TWyWQKlqaa	To know for sure you have to be tested.

XhIYAH6Laa	What is Autism?  Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities.    Autism is one of five disorders that falls under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), a category of neurological disorders characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	People who are autistic usually develop the symptoms as a young child. not an adult.   The range of autism is very large in how well they function.  Many are stuck in thier own worlds and never learn to acknowledge the world around them. Others are considered mild and are highly intellegent and very functional to the point of being in regular classrooms as a kid, as well as boyscouts etc. Just depends on the kid and how much help they get early on.|`|8ryoShBpaa	You have to have the symptoms since early childhood for the label autism.  Yes, you absolutely can develop all the symptoms of autism at any age, but then they call it a different label.  Other labels used if you develop the symptoms after early childhood are schizophrenia, Obsessive-Compulsive Dis., Bipolar, Fibromyalgia, Encephalitis, Lyme Disease, M.S., ALS, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Disintegration Dis., Depression, and I am sure there are more.|`|dVJ3F6YFaa	Autism is a form of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD).  PDDs cannot develop as an adult.  PDD's are typically diagnosed based on behavioral observations, however, they stem from differences in brain functioning.  For more detailed information about the diagnosis and what to look for in a quality evaluation read my article at http://www.ehow.com/how_4723735_autism-a...    -For those with more subtle forms of Autism or Asperger's disorder, it is not uncommon to be diagnosed as an adult, though.  This could happen because the more subtle forms were not as widely understood nor known when most people who are adults now were children.  Additionally, behaviors that do not stand out as inappropriate at a young age, really are noticeable if they are continuing at an older age.  Finally, those with higher functioning Autism or Asperger's disorder often have a set of differences that is not highly observable without a good evaluation.
qFDeiewgaa	Whey will help a lot, but it's no miracle worker and it won't work as fast as you think.    Just think of it this way, your body needs protein to rebuild muscles after they tear (working-out) and takes 48 hours to rebuild. So the more protein you consume within those 48 hours, then you'll gain more than without protein.    And you should gain the amount of grams of protein per pound you have in your body.|`|AA11584616	Whey protein is the best thing you can use if you do not want to take any supplements. It helps you to build muscle. Just remember, no matter what the people at the store tell you, you can only absorb 20 grams at a time. GNC (www.gnc.com) has some great protein products. I used to work there. Thats how I got most of this knowledge.  |`|1FGuhsFWaa	Protein is a vital nutrient that your body needs every day. Whey protein is a natural protein made from cows milk, highly valued by nutritionists and serious athletes alike because it provides an excellent source of the essential amino acids needed to fuel the body and maintain muscle mass. It naturally low in fat and cholesterol, and contains little to no lactose. |`|lEXTHOZPaa	More than other protein supplements, whey protein powder is commonly used by bodybuilders and other athletes to accelerate muscle development and aid in recovery. Some individuals with suppressed or otherwise abnormal immune systems or degenerative diseases use undenatured bioactive whey proteins to increase their antioxidant levels. Native whey proteins are a good source of cysteine, a conditionally essential amino acid, which is the rate-limiting factor for the body's production of glutathione[1], an important antioxidant.

Its great your able to do those exercises but your body seems to be so used to doing them that it will not lose more wait.    Try a running, hiking, or something new.

If you want to do weight training, you can easily buy a set of dumbbells at walmart or some place for fairly cheap to do stuff at home. If not, you can always use cans of stuff, or fill up bottles with water for extra weight. But getting some sort of 'cardio' would be the best, whether it's chasing after your kids, or just a walk.

Free weights are an option, as are elastic bands for resistance training.   There are a lot of good exercise DVDs out there that you can do at home and you might want to check those out.  Don't forget to stretch after you exercise - flexibility is probably the most neglected aspect of fitness.

gDTorxV1aa	I had the same problem. You must have hurt it while lifting the barbell. Well try this it works wonders. First of all get yourself good gloves with additional wrist straps. For the time being give it a rest for a week. Apply ice to the affected area. After it heals. Start with lighter weights. Never bend your wrists while lifting the weights. Work your chest slowly not with a jerk. And, work your forearm muscles once once a week. And, always warm up your wrist with rotations.|`|WIjAw7cCaa	Hey, the best thing you can get is a wrist support, this will help your wrist wile you bench press.     Have you had a previous injury, be it big or small on your wrist? i had an injury to my wrist when i was about 14 (im now 24) that caused a hairline fracture once healed it was fine. but when i started going to gym i had to use a support.    hope this helps|`|iHXS7BuCaa	maybe you're not warming up or stretching before doing bench press, or maybe you have a fracture in your wrist, try to consult a doctor.|`|TgBYy6HBaa	Whatever you do, don't get wrist wraps.  Any time you brace a body part to prevent injury all you're doing is preventing that part of the body from getting stronger.  Period.      If your wrists hurt it's probably because your hands are not in line with your forearms when you are benching.  If your hands are at a severe angle to your forearms when you bench it is very possible to create a pain in your wrist.    It all depends on your size and build, but you need to figure out exactly where the most comfortable and workable grip is for you.  Take the weight completely off and just try to hold the bar at different positions and watch the angle of your hand to your forearm.  Bring it down to your chest and all the way back up and keep a keen eye on everything.  Do this until you believe you have it right and then start adding the weight.  If you are doing this for the first time, then keep doing this before you bench until it becomes natural.    Also, if you are new to the bench then you may be finding the weak links in the chain right now.  Obviously some muscles are stronger than others and when you bench you are using way more muscles than you think.  There is a good chance if you are using a comfortable grip and have good technique that your wrists will slowly get stronger and not feel anymore pain as time goes on.    Your best bet is always to grab someone who knows what they are doing (preferably an employee of the gym... not just some meathead who does bench 5 days a week) and ask them for advice on your technique.  That is a great way to prevent any bad habbits and bad pains.|`|iPxkUJ64aa	its the gloves... get some shiek gel women's gloves and you will be able to lift  heavy without any pain    i had the same thing happen for a workout once... i just took a couple of days off and it felt better    how about showing me your guns|`|VXE3Ces9aa	weights are too heavy, or you have an injury that has to heal first. if it doesn't go away after a month, a scan might be in order, but reduce weights first.

1ggESF58aa	Sounds like a pretty good plan to me.  Glad to see you are balancing your diet as well, just throw some fruit in there... a banana every day might be beneficial as you are working out 5 days in a row, and the added potassium will help kep your muscles from getting to sore.  Also, lots and lots of water.    Depending on the type of cardio I would say you will lose some weight.  I'm not sure about 15-20 pounds of weight.  15 might be more appropriate, but don't be surprised if you plateau around 10 pounds with that regimen.  I would suggest trying to match the cardio you do on average on an elliptical or treadmill that will show you approximately how many calories you are burning.      Calculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate) which is how many calories your body would burn (approximately) if you did no exercise.  Your's is around 1440.    So if you ate 2000 calories today, you would need to exercise enough to burn off 560 calories to not gain weight (in theory - everyone is different and I hear all this stuff about thyroids and chemical inbalance and junk).  I think for a normal person, this theory applies - unused energy is stored as fat.  Energy consumption is through food intake, and energy expulsion is through your body's normal activity (BMR) and added physical activity (exercise).  If it is balanced (consumption = expulsion) then you don't store calories.|`|IiQNfmhhaa	There's not enough information here to predict your result. In general you are doing the right things but you haven't quantized them. How many calories are you consuming each day? How many calories are you burning each day? I know it is time consuming and boring but you must do this for at least a while to determine where you're at.     Here are some inescapable facts:    1. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat.    2.  lbs of fat lost= (Calories consumed - Calories burned)/ 3500    3. Generally accepted minimum calorie intake for females is 1200   per day. Going below this minimum is counterproductive. It will cause your metabolism to slow down resulting in fewer calories burned.    4. Two to three pounds of fat loss per week is the MAXIMUM you should attempt. Anything more will require unhealthy practices. A half to 2 pounds a week is very healthy and will be easier to maintain over time.     A good place to go to analyze your daily calorie intake is http://www.mypyramid.gov  It is free Be honest with yourself and enter everything. You won't have to be as anal after you get a good idea of the difference between your calorie intake and expenditure over time. On days when you eat more than average or burn less than average you may want to go back and be more exact.    Don't diet just make adjustments to your eating and exercise habits to maintain a consistent week by week weight loss until you get to your goal weight. Then adjust your habits to maintain that weight. Lifestyle changes are easier to maintain over a long period of time than dieting.    I discuss a  lot of  this at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com     |`|M6c0hUefaa	I know how you feel I'm still losing the baby weight as well.

QaSPJ9gpaa	It's somewhat normal, but it's also a foresight into a problem that can occur in the future if things aren't done properly. When you do curls, you MUST do the entire movement up and back down straight. If you do not, when the muscles get larger, they will regrow in such a way that will only accommodate for the curl movement that you've done, and if you did not do the entire range, you will be unable to put your arms straight. So keep that in mind as you do curls so that you will retain your full range of motion.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	perfectly normal, it gets very painful/sore after a hard workout, to stretch the muscles again, untill they have recovered after a day or a few days.|`|5xlvMtL3aa	Its a normal thing after a very hard workout. You pushed your muscles too far and probably ddin't stretch before the workout. The only thing to do here is to stretch your arm slowly everytime.

It will take atleast two weeks for your arms to get better.  I wouldnt do anymore curls in the meantime. The first two weeks do light and medium weights until your body gets used to it.  It takes time to lift heavy weights.

CWSmFBs4aa	Like the other person said.. squats is a great way to build strength. However you must make sure you do them correct or you will hurt yourself.   I would recommend doing squats with dumbbells. Get a dumbbell in each hand.. old them to each side of your body and squat down so your legs are parallel. Make sure you keep your back straight or you will injure yourself.  Do 8 reps and do 4 or 5 sets.  Walking lunges is a great way to build leg strength. You will get a great work out if you do two sets of walking lunges for a minute on each set.  Step ups is also a good one. Put dumbbells in each hand and step up onto a box. Alternate which legs you do. Great cardio exercise as well if you do 10 on each leg.  jumping rope is a good way to build calf muscles and work on explosiveness.  Any kind of meat will is a good source of protein. Steak.. baked chicken and fish.. tuna.. peanut better and jelly is a post workout snack.  After you workout you should eat within 30 mins to an hour. or all that you did during your workout will be wasted. your muscles need protein to get big. if you dont eat your muscles will start to break down.  a good and safe post supplement to take is cell mass.. you can find it at GNC   goodluck|`|yqp3RtYWaa	squats deadlift and benchpress should help you improve ur overall fitness and remember to get enough protein.|`|QFipczGLaa	Do squats, lunges, calf raises.

251427a6d1a2adb2b575831180d1c1ceaa	Ice water actually makes your body burn calories because it has to work to warm back up! Good thing is it taste better freezing cold!    You should drink half of your body weight in ounces. Say you weigh 250lbs you should drink 125oz of water.|`|VDKVy4A3aa	No, it is actually not the best thing for you.  When you drink it, it brings a surprise and shock to your stomach and takes a while to adjust to something that cold. You should drink room temperature water.   If you want to loose weight, you can;t rely on this. You have to boost your metabolism by aerobic exercise 20 min a day for every other day, and switching to meals you can eat forever. If you suddenly stop your routine, then you will gain your weight back|`|GLOBmh0Baa	Yes it does! 8 glasses per day:    Here are some other tips if you are interested:    Diet:    As I am sure you know already, cut down on all fatty foods, eat 5 fruit/veg per day and choose low fat options.    You could try joining a club such as weight watchers as this will give you lots of diet plans and help you to stay motivated.    Exercise! :    You should 'exercise' for a full twenty minutes at a time, five days per week to stay at a healthy weight.    Remember, don't over-do it and certainly don't try to lose weight too quickly. The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.    The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, poer-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts. However, strength-training is also important to increase muscle-fat ratio.    Exercise does burn calories but it takes a while to lose 1 pound of weight! However, exercise is essential to maintain weight loss and maintain your body at peak efficiency.

Also, it does fill you up, so that you can fool the stomach into feeling full momentarily.    The ice water thing is bizarre but true, the colder you are, the more you shiver, so your metabolism must speed up to stop you from getting perilously cold - as long as you couple drinking fluids with a healthy diet and exercise you should see great results.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Iced or not, if drinking water does help you lose weight it's because it fills you up, you feel less hungry, and you don't eat as much. Drinking water, tea or coffee instead of snacking on junk food between meals could certainly help.|`|8Ie4S7ggaa	I think so. A little while back i drank loads of ice water a day and i seemed to lose weight and my skin was cleaer. I also generally felt healthier. I heard it burns about 30 calories for your body to warm itslef up again. Sucking on an ice cube burns 40. I dont remember how many glasses i drank per day but aim for about 8 cus that what the recomendation is. Keep it up though as u wont get resukts if u only do it for a day or two. Good luck xxxxxxx|`|BGIsuNMTaa	No but boiled water does as it sterilises anything bad in the water and is much better for washing toxins out of the body     It is reccommended to drink 3-5 glasses a day    good luck|`|KAyVeRezaa	Water in general will help lose weight. Doesn't matter if its cold or not. Studies I've seen just indicates that cold cools off the body better(obviously of course). Carry a water bottle with you. Drink when you feel thirsty. Fill up anywhere for free.|`|xDSScmkDaa	Yes it does, 100 per cent, i tried it myself and it really worked. I drank around about 2 litres of very very cold water, a good idea is to drink most of it with your meals as it gets you fuller fast, you wont eat as much as then you loose even more calories.
nChbnDvyaa	Hepatitis A, (formerly known as infectious hepatitis), is an acute infectious disease of the liver caused by Hepatitis A virus,[1] which is most commonly transmitted by the fecal-oral route via contaminated food or drinking water.|`|DUpZhTwQaa	needles, sex, blood, spit  dont drink the water as egypt can be dirty.  dont eat foods that may have water in them (salads etc)  just to  be on the safe side  HAVE A GOOD TRIP!  |`|woIyecklaa	Hepatitis A is through fecal-oral transmission (dirty water, touching food with dirty hands after going to bathroom.  Hepatitis B is through blood and sex.  Hepatitis C is through blood, and possibly sex.  Hepatitis D is though blood and sex and you can only get it if you also have Hep B.  Hepatitis E is Fecal-oral like A.    There are vaccines for both A and B and I would highly recommend them. You can get them both at the same time in a vaccine called Twinrix. You have to get it 3 times over 6 months though.|`|pyzkCi3Xaa	you should get vaccinated for hep A before you go.  and check out any other vaccinations that are recommended (maybe typhoid).      Hep A is transmitted fecal orally, which means that someone doesn't wash their hands well or at all and then touches food. if you then eat the food you are infected.  sounds disgusting, doesn't it.  it just takes a little bit too, the person probably thinks their hands are clean enough.    Children often transmit it because they are bad at washing their hands and in children you usually don't know that they are sick.  so its business as usual.      So, the probably got the infection from food.      remember, wash it, boil it or peel it.  keep that in mind during your trip. don't eat street food.
HNdJfNYMaa	I think its the other way around. They get addicted to junk food, and that makes them lazy, and eventually they will become unhealthy and fat. And I dont know any fat people who dont want to get healthy... most of them want to loose weight. But if they dont want to, then there is probably something wrong.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	I'm fat and I don't like junk food much these days but growing up it's what my parents [who were always busy with work] left lying around the house and being young and unable to cook it was always there.    So I see this "love" of junkfood as a conveience for people who eat it. See that i am not saying fat/lazy/unhealthy.  Everyone eats something junkie for different reasons. maybe they are busy/running late/to tired to cook/what have you.    I believe those that label others as unhealthy/too healthy/too fat/etc etc are worried about becoming what that other person is.  Or they just feel that they can gain a quick ego boost from people on a faceless forum where anyone from any background can answer un/truthfully about questions they ask.  Makes them feel others agree with them or that they are cool and popular.    Sadly, the reality is that their thoughtless/stupid/inconsiderate answers/questions only get them laughed at and people to hate them.    But if it makes you feel good then please, continue with what you're doing.  Nobodies going to stop you until you've really crossed the line.  But everyone [sadly] is entitled to their own opinion... Regardless of how stupid it logically is.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Hey, not sure what these other people are talking about... obviously the guy who said get a life DOESN'T have one, because if he went out into society AT ALL he would understand what you are saying... I don't get it either... I don't think you can categorize all overweight people into a group like one you have described, but there are definitely a majority of them who make no effort to change their health conditions, and try to belittle those of us who enjoy being fit and in shape...|`|cf11f0be088b7102c472f4c096e92e4faa	It's like a comfort food for them. Sometimes it helps them cope with problems because this is something they think that they only can control. They can control what they want to eat, how much, when to eat it, etc. Sadly sometimes it's too late for them to realize they have more power than searching for food to make them happy.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	why are you generalizing. Who is "they"?  I am overweight. I dont criticize anyone for eating healthy. You are the one criticizing right? Maybe some of us are "mentally weak"   Does that give you permission to judge someone and try and put them down? No.  Get over yourself, you're better than no one?|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Some people find comfort in food. They self medicate with food , using it to what they think is help them through rough times. Just as people with narcotic or alcohol abuse. You criticize  and label the overweight people just as you feel they criticize and label those who exercise.|`|heLEYmZ7aa	excuse me? you are very ignorant.     skinny people love eating junk food too.   I know so many skinny people that eat so much junk.   they just have faster merabolisms.      go get a life. or maybe a conscience|`|NdKbSO3yaa	LMFAO!!!!|`|c5e192691e37f2b13dac95da50617e61aa	Well first off I have never been called a health freak by any overweight person. What I usually find is that my overweight friends try to bring me down with them. If I want to go home for lunch they want to talk me into going for a burger or a pizza...  Next to that I think there are different categories...For instance after having 2 children I found my self to be quite out of shape, not getting in enough exercise and snacking on junk like chips or popcorn after putting the little ones to sleep. Although I still ALWAYS ate healthy meals...just did not put forth enough effort. So you are right VERY mentally weak!! In my case bad food just tasted damn good. I never called any of my friends "health freaks" If anything they were just there to motivate me once I realized what I was doing to myself.  I have lost 18lbs now! ALMOST back to normal!! Once your fat you are not stuck in a rut of being that way forever. I wish I could help more people see that!!
Dhz4XgQ3aa	eating chocolate is a myth i was told this by my dermatologist years ago.   Drink lots of water, eat 5 portions of fruit and veg a day and i tell you what i think helped my skin Actimel drinks, one every day. I dont know how but try it as it worked for me.   I have been through every acne treatment there is until i finally was put on Roaccutane by a dermatologist when i was 15 or 16.   I am now 27 and maintain my skin by eating well and drinking lots of water. I used to drink 6 pints a day of water. 2 in the morning 2 when i got home from school and two after dinner. Its hard to sustain but it def worked for my skin until i just could stand drinking that much water anymore.   If your skin is bothering you that bad go to your doctor and get some antibiotics or if your a girl Dianette is brilliant as a acne treatment.  Good luck honey.|`|xiFBN6aDaa	Drink LOTS of water! my friend used to have a horrible acne problem and all she drank was iced tea.

If you want to drop down a bit you should try a vegeterian diet or eat less meat, or doing alot of running and exercise daily is a good way.

First of all, could you tell me what exercise you do, and tell me in detail what diet have you tried?    It takes time for losing weight but in one year i think you can lose that 50 pound.|`|IiQNfmhhaa	Diets don't work. You have to change your eating and exercise habits.  Fruit is good but limit it to those below 45 glycemic index. Google glycemic index or go to http://www.glycemicindex.com/    Don't eat more than two fruits per day. You need to add protein. Don't eat any carbohydrate that is white, ie. white bread, potatoes, rice etc.    If you are not exercising start walking everyday. Start with a mile and work up to 2 miles in less than 30 minutes.     Add some weight training exercises if you can.    Here are some facts:    1. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. If you burn 3500 calories than you consume, you will lose 1 lb.    2. The equation is: Fat lost=(Calories consumed - Calories burned) divided by 3500.    3. Females should not consume less than 1200 calories per day- males 1800. To consume less will result in lowered metabolism and less calories burned.You will feel tired and lose weight at less than an optimum rate.    4. Muscle burns 98% of the calories you consume. The more muscle tissue you have,the more calories you will burn even while sitting or sleeping. Exercise will not only burn extra calories but add muscles, turning your body into a fat burning machine.    5. Since muscle weighs more than fat, if you exercise regularly, don't use your weight as a measure of your success. Combine weighing with measurements, your appearance, and how your clothes fit to get a better idea of how you're doing.    6. It will take 10-14 days for your body to change from using carbohydrates as the primary energy source, to using fat as the primary energy source. Limit your carbohydrate intake to 35-50 grams for 2 weeks. This will speed up the changes in your body chemistry reguired to convert your stored fat into blood sugar for energy. Don't go above 75- 100 grams thereafter.    7. Drink at least 64 oz. of water a day. This will help maintain the right chemistry in your body to convert the fat to energy.    I discuss this and more at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com|`|VCeMaUA8aa	you should excersise at least 30 minutes a day and control your calorie intake|`|ih0Q48Evaa	Just so you know, i'm 16 and i had the same problem. I lost a lot of weight from this, but it does take time, you have to have the willpower, and you have to want it! Start out your day with a big breakfast. Eat a lot of metabolism boosting foods, like grape fruit. If you skip breakfast your body basically goes into a starvation mode and it won't burn any calories, because it thinks you're starving it. So, it's really important not to skip meals. Try to eat a little lunch, but healthy! Maybe a salad light on the dressings. For dinner have things like pastas, etc. Pastas, like spaghetti, keep you full for a longer amount of time.When you are eating you should always keep portion control in mind. It's really easy for a person to over eat. you should eat until you are satisfied, not until you a full. And when you do get full, you just get lazy and tired, which if you eat until your satisfied you will have more energy to go out and burn more calories. -Make sure when you are planning your meals you are getting all the food from the food groups, it's more important than you may think -You should really try to stay away from coffee and pops. A good snack in the middle of the day is a granola bar. It's also very important that you get exercise two to three times a week, if not more. The best exercise you can do to lose inches off your waste is walking! -- Good Luck|`|u8mZYnBRaa	ummmm seems that you are working hard but not getting the desired results...I can suggest you to carry on whatever you are doing regarding weight loss plus you can do one more thing ie you can join a good gym and have a good trainer for you.

If you get a good gym and trainer I am sure you are going to be slim and look prettier also..:)  so be happy and seek some good gym. Hope I helped.|`|97NcVJ1Saa	start running. Dont get discouraged/embarrassed when you first start out.  If you stick with it, you will lose weight and start feeling better about yourself.
a4b20b8ed961cfe0fc29cf3d3c1d0038aa	congrats on your first yeast infection! just kidding...i know it's gross. make sure to wear a pad while you are on the treatment because it will "leak out" throughout the day and can stain your clothes. by this evening when you do your next treatment, don't worry about the path being "blocked". either your body will absorb the cream from the previous night and some will have leaked out during the day so you sould be clear. plus, the cream is soft and cannot "harden" and block up your vagina. i have been on 7 day treatments and been fine.   when you say "clean yourself out thoroughly" at the end of the three days, if you mean douche, then no!!! douching can lead to more yeast because it kills off your good bacteria. then you would have to start all over again!  after several days, the rest of the medication will have been absorbed or leaked out and you will be "clean" good luck, hope this helps|`|56cc6c6d1f119c41cc008ebafbc3c090aa	No, no. Leave all the cream in there. Even once you've taken all the treatments it's still working to control the yeast. Wear a panty liner. I know it feels kinda squishy and gross.|`|Ime4o7Sraa	just make sure you use all three days worth and its ok if there is some left over from the night befor this infection will be gone befor you no it|`|YCfcl9Evaa	Do not clean yourself out or even put fingers in there - you dont need more bacteria in there.   Your vagina is gona clean itself out - just like it does when you have a period. It will come out a lot during the day - every time you go to bathroom you will see that.  If you use douche or anything like that you might get it again.
26fGdWKpaa	Hmm, it's really hard to tell this early.Some signs of pregnancy do not even appear until later into the pregnancy.     If I were you, I would take a home pregnancy test. If it shows up negative, I would take another one a week later just to be on the safe side. If it shows up positive, I would go to the doctor and discuss your options. If you are pregnant and plan to keep the baby, your doctor may suggest you take special prenatal vitamins.      I hope everything turns out ok! =]|`|16XLEsCeaa	well, before jumping to conclusions, take a test and don't freak out. If you're not sure about the test, go to a doctor and have them tell you.

Then I would go in to the doctor and have them give you a test.|`|dL1FARC6aa	oooo baby ur eggo is preggo!!!  wooooooooo!!!|`|431zhNe6aa	If your period was supposed to start today that's no biggie that you haven't gotten it.  Know what?  All your stress over wondering if you're pregnant can be causing you to be late.    By the way, darkening or the areolas doesn't happen this quickly.  Swollen/tender breasts (which you don't have) can happen when you're pregnant OR when you're getting your period.  You most probably wouldn't have morning sickness yet -- not if you had sex and maybe became preggo on June 20th or 24th.  Backaches don't occur until late in pregnancy.  Food cravings are "iffy" in any case.  Some people believe they are phychological but, in any case, that's no way to judge if you're pregnant as a point of information.  If you're always dizzy, then that category wouldn't apply, right.  But, after having 4 kids myself, I don't remember that that's one of the regular and normal "symptoms" of pregnancy.  I did faint early on with my 1st pregnancy but it was like 90 degrees with very high humidity in a contained, close, hot building.  I don't think that counts.  I'd do the same thing now, probably, not preggo.  Aroma sensitivity?  That also goes with migraines.       Sure you have heartburn, mood swings, irritability and bloating, in ANY case.  You're stressed and upset.  And, if your period is on the way, of course those symptoms, especially the bloating, right?    I think you should wait a bit before wanting to jump off a bridge.  Maybe you can go to a Planned Parenthood facility (in the phone book or can be found online) and they will give you the pregnancy test thing for free, if it's a problem for you to buy one at the drug store.  I don't know your financial situation and can't assume that money doesn't matter to you.    I just would not be upset that it didn't come TODAY.  Don't know how old you are.  Has your period been exactly, absolutely, positively on time for at least a year or two now, never deviating?    Of course, I hope you get your period if that's what you also hope (I think you do).  And, assuming you do, I know this must be scaring you a lot and you'll be more careful next time.      I still don't get what a "questionable" condom is but, that's OK.      I wish you well and lots of luck, OK?|`|AZMabVn7aa	I think you are.|`|LAX7hV0Kaa	while, there is no sure fire way to be sure. except maybe to get a pregnancy test, with the evil little - and +.

9FzQYqM9aa	Steroids are of 2 kinds - anabolic (performance enhancing) and systemic (therapeutic) The systemic steroids are usually available ove rthe counter at all pharma stores but I believe the pharmacist may ask for a prescription.   Systemic steroids are used to help control auto immune disorders such as rheumatism/arthritis/uveitis etc and cause weight gain  and heart problems (pretty much the same as with anabolic steroids) Thus continuous use is not recommended.  The tablets that fall in this category are (for eg:) Betnesol, Prednisone/Prednisolone.  Always check with your doctor before you go in for  steroids...they are very dangerous if overdosed as also in the long run.  If you need steroids for the sake of body-building, please banish the thought and instead go for protein supplements that are available across the counter at many shops. This will ensure you remain healthy and work up your bulk! (try the Bullworker protein supplements)|`|4kp4dYkXaa	Advice: DON'T TAKE THEM. I took some and I would go back anyday to change that!

Only 1/3 of medical schools require physicians to take courses in musculoskeletal medicine.     In short, your OB and PCP are probably not the best people with whom to discuss your joint pain.     Regarding your specific case, all people feel at least random pain in the body...often for unknown reasons, but probably best explained by a random misfiring of the nervous system    Progressive joint pain, especially if increasing in frequency, duration and intensity should be evaluated for further causes.  Pregnancy can increase joint pain due to swelling among other various reasons.  Carpal tunnel, itself, is not described as a joint pain. Rather, it is pain and numbness, tingling and loss of strength in the distibution of the median nerve...ie, usually in the first three digits. It is common those who are pregnant...but if this doesn't describe you, I would probably follow up with a rheumatologist...there is a possibility you need blood work testing.      Addendum: Pain in all five digist would not be usual for carpal tunnel...medicaid coverage for a rehumatologist will vary between states. Generally speaking, it is difficult to get specialty care when you are on medicaid.  Blood tests are safe during pregnancy because they are only taking a small sample out...nothing is being put into your body.|`|0lh4Cxx4aa	I agree it doesn't sound like carpal tunnel. That only affects your hands and wrists (which is where the carpal tunnel is). I'd find a different doctor. I'd also start keeping a pain journal- when it happens, where in your body, what type of pain, and what you're doing when you have it. Then you'll be able to describe your condition easily.|`|S85CFeFVaa	you need to relax more, if anybody asks you to do anythin round da house say to them  'go **** yourself, i'm knocked up'.|`|Z026qDC2aa	it DOES sound like carpal tunnel      The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are tingling, numbness, weakness, or pain felt in the fingers or, less commonly, in the palm. Symptoms most often occur in the parts of the hand supplied by the median nerve: the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. If your little finger is not affected, this may be a sign that the condition is carpal tunnel syndrome, because the little finger is usually controlled by a different nerve than the thumb and other fingers. See an illustration of areas affected in the hand.
W4whHKmxaa	The tests you mentioned are known as the liver enzymes.  The ALT is made mostly in the liver , the AST is also made  in the liver but also other organs as well, like the heart, etc.  There are so many different things that can be wrong to  cause elevations of these enzymes.  There are things  you can stop doing to make these come down if it is  caused from them.    If you are going to a primary care physician, I would ask  if he could refer you to a gastroenterologist or a   hepatologist.  The physicians usually do not start out  doing a liver biopsy.  They do blood work, usually an  ultrasound to look at the liver, then maybe a CT scan or  MRI.  Liver biopsies are usually performed when they  notice that the liver has changed it appearance or they  suspect that the liver may be not able to function well.    The doctors can see from your blood tests if the liver  has inflammation.  Inflammation can be treated and the  cells can heal.  He can see if there is damage or the  starting of damage.  He can also see if the liver is  performing some of the functions it does to keep the  body well.  You mentioned the liver enzymes here.  The liver function tests are known as the Bilirubin,  Albumin, INR, PT, PTT.  You can look them up on  this site and see what the results may mean:  http://www.labtestsonline.org.  You can also look up the enzymes you mentioned.    The liver is a smooth organ and soft and pliable.  As the liver starts to have inflammation inside of it,  it enlarges and feels spongy.  The doctor can usually  feel this when he examines you.  When the cells of the liver dies, the liver will shrink,  scar tissue develops in the liver, and it will start to feel  hard and nodules or lumps will appear.     Here is a link on cirrhosis, which is death of the liver cells.  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...    Liver disease is caused by(1) Alcohol in many patients.  Stop drinking alcohol, and if the inflammation is in the  liver, it may heal. (2) If you are taking any medications  like over the counter pain medications, other over the  counter medications, herbs, herbal teas, or drugs  from other doctors...be sure to tell the doctor you are  seeing for this condition.  Medications go to the liver  to be processed first before going to other parts of the  body and even prescription ones may be hard on the  liver.  (don't stop any meds the doctor puts you on without  first checking with them)....(3)If you are around chemicals or  work with chemicals; this can cause your enzymes to rise.  Stay away from chemicals like carbon tetrachloride.  (4)If you have gallbladder problems or a stone from the  gallbladder blocks the tube like structures coming from  the liver to the intestines...or these tubes become twisted  or mal formed and causes the bile to back up into the liver.  Tell the doctor of any pain you feel and try to pinpoint   where the pain is at. (5) liver disease can also happen   from hereditary conditions.  (6) If you have gained alot  of weight or are heavy, you may have a fatty liver and  depending on what caused the fatty liver, losing weight  will sometimes reverse this condition.     As you can see, it can be coming from many different  things, even taking medications the doctor may have  prescribed for you but are necessary.    Inflammation can be healed with medications.   Changing what you do may also help.  Once the cells  of the liver die, though, there is no turning aback since  this disease may progress.  That is if this is what was  causing it...a problem with the liver.     Hope this info helps.|`|AA10847209	If your Dr recommends one, please do it. good luck.
AA11295695	A TB is not a "finger prick", you're actually getting a slight innoculation of TB to see if you react to it.  The doctor or nurse gives you a SC that forms a tiny bubble under your skin.  If you react, then you either have TB or have had it and have antibodies to it.    About the passing out, did you eat enough today?  Or drink enough water?  Sometimes our bodies just get all funky and you get lightheaded.      You can always postpone the donating of blood if you want, it all depends on how you feel tomorrow.  Feel better.|`|AA11185479	A TB test is just a finger prick, but a blood donation requires lying down for half an hour while a larger needle sits in your arm vein.      I suggest you try to conquer your fear/aversion.  Perhaps it was just the sight of your own blood, or the unexpectedness of it.  Mental focus will help you control the knee-jerk reaction of fainting.      Request that you lie down (instead of sitting) during the donation, and rest there for at least ten minutes afterwards.  Get up VERY slowly, and pause a minute before you stand.  be sure to refuel with juice and cookies (usually provided for you).|`|7E6yEUVoaa	they will take more blood for donation than for a TB test.  if u think u cant make it through, dont do it.  if u are determined, focus on something else. it is normal to feel woozy or dizzy after blood is taken.

BECAUSE I FELT THAT ALL PEOPLE WERE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER, I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LOGICAL THAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE SAME FOODS. IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT SINCE EACH PERSON WAS  HOUSED IN A SPECIAL BODY WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES AND NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, THE ONLY WAY TO MAINTAIN HEALTH OR CURE ILLNESS WAS TO ACCOMMODATE TO THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT'S SPECIFIC NEEDS.    Your blood type is the key that unlocks the door to the mysteries of health, disease, longevity, physical vitality and emotional strength. Your blood type determines your susceptibility to illness, which foods you should eat and how you should exercise.

It happens to everyone!  The reason being is that you lose a lot of water weight in the first few weeks so it seems like your losing more.com Also if you have been exerciseing or working out, you will build muscle which naturally weighs heavier than fat so it wont seem like your losing anything but you are - your toning up!    Try not to use the scales that often....if you look and feel healthier then that should be motivation to keep it up!!    Best of Luck!  xxx|`|SYrkWz9zaa	I hate when that happens!

No dices tu edad, pero me imagino que has de ser una jovencita.  Si eres muy joven, o te encuentras en los tres primeros a?os de tu menstruacin, tu cuerpo esta todava "tomando su ritmo" ya que no es madurado del todo, y todava vas a pasar por muchos cambios hormonales.  Es relativamente normal que las menstruaciones de los primeros tres o cuatro a?os sean abundantes, pero no al punto que desarrolles anemia por exceso de sangrado, te recomiendo tomar multivitamnicos, pare evitar anemia.  Si tu flujo menstrual es de una sangra mas oscura, de lo que sera normal si te hicieras una cortada, estas teniendo un flujo menstrual normal, ve de inmediato al doctor si notaras que tus menstruaciones arrojan sangre "al rojo vivo, ya que podra tratarse de una hemorragia.  Por lo general, las caractersticas de tu menstruacin, pueden ser muy similares a las de tu madre, si ella padeci de flujos abundantes, hay muchas probabilidades que tu tambin los tengas, por eso a ella le parecen normal tus sntomas.  Para evitar los clicos menstruales, te recomiendo que hagas ejercisios abdominales durante  los dias en que no tengas tu perodo, y debes de interrumpirlos justo el dia que inicies tu sangrado.  Es conveniente que bajes un poco tu ritmo cuando ests en tu perodo, olvdate de andar en moto o montando caballos, sas son imgenes falsas para vender tampones. Bajarle a tu ritmo, cuando tienes un periodo muy abundante es una medida inteligente, y con esto no quiero decir, que te arropes en toallas y te tires en un sof como anciana, solo bjele al ritmo a tus actividades fsicas, aydale a tu cuerpo.  La duracin de una menstruacin normal, va entre 3 hasta 6 das, con variedad en el flujo durante esos dias, hasta la desaparicin del mismo durante ese perodo.  Si an as, tus molestias son muy grandes, o sientes que tu sangrado es excesivo, consulta a un gincologo, l te har las evaluaciones fsicas pertinentes, para diagnosticar cualquier anomala.

M7xBOhP6aa	Have you recently gained any weight?    You don't have a six pack. You have a big of chub. But, it's not that bad and if you wanted to improve it, then it wouldn't take very long.    chances are, it they are joking to your face, then they probably don't REALLY think you are fat or unnatractive. Usually people don't joke about that serious of things.    IMO, I like it :)

e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	It depends on the guy. Trust me, when a guy sees a breast, he is never turned off unless he is an immature weirdo.     No one can say if they are going to get bigger. Dont worry about what guys like. I know this is hard to do but when they all grow up, the real men just want a lovely person with a zest for life and being happy.    I am 38 with an A cup and I have never had any problems with men disliking my breast. I always get attention when I go out even if I do not want it. Luckily for me, I dont get a lot of perverts like my busty friends. A freak will go for what they see so that they can have instant gratification. I tend to get men who want to get to know me. I am not saying that I dont get a perv's attention every now and again, I do. I really think that as long as you carry yourself in a positive way, then your breasts are the last thing to worry about.     I have small breasts and my body is hot. I stay in shape and feel good about what I have. If I find I can not fit a certain kind of dress... Victoria's Secret makes a great push up bra.     I have friends who have had breast reductions or say they wish they had mine. A lot of girls who flaunted their breasts in high school are drooping now and mine still look like a teenagers cuz they are perky. It is a downside to being big and to being small. Just appreciate what you have and someone else will too.    No worries mate, you will be fine. Do not let your breast size determine your self worth. Even if you get bigger, if you dont like the real you, your negativity will keep the positive guys away. Guys love confident girls.|`|UCXCkooWaa	of course guys will ALWAYS like bigger breasts.

I don't think any breasts are actually a turn-off to guys, but yes, probably some guys prefer them bigger.  But then again, some guys prefer smaller breasts, more petite bodies, etc and might be turned off by DD's.    Any guy worth having isn't gonna complain about your breast size, if it's that important to him, he's a rather shallow individual that you probably don't want to deal with. But most guys really don't make their decision on a girls physical attractiveness based on one feature alone.         It's just a matter of who you're asking, and there's no way you can please everyone so just be happy with what you got.
AA12109717	Are you an active person? Do you like to drink caffeine every morning? You got to give us more than this. Falling asleep at midnight is not a major sleeping problem.

Go for a jog or try reading a book till you get tired.|`|MKRemZkuaa	Proper exercise would help. Maybe there is too much energy in you  to go to sleep.

If you're not fit enough to run for the interval parts, do walking intervals - hills, preferably, or vary your walking speed (or do the hard intervals at a jog, then walk again to recover).  Stick to it and you'll be amazed at how quickly you'll be able to start running.    Good luck!|`|31otvjiIaa	Ok I'm a fitness person because I'm an athlete. What you need to do is buy more cold cuts (turkey,ham), eat wheat bread because white bread makes you gain weight. Drink plenty of water. Have fruit and vegetables in your house. Try to stay away from snacks. If you do buy snacks then the best kind is like nutri grain bars, chewy bars, and kellogg bars. Now the physical part is being at home and doing around 300 situps a day. You can break it down to 150 in the morning and 150 at night. If you like to dance then make it more fun and choose 3 or 4 songs and just dance to them. Little do you know, that helps your heart rate andit burns calories. Its best if you run also. You may run for 15 minutes and then walk for 2 then run for another and walk for 2. Do this daily or every other day and you should be where you like.|`|5m7MEFzXaa	Don't eat too much food. Not only will you lose weight you'll save pennies! then try doing stretches and stuff which should help your body regain fitness.|`|EAFZ44wgaa	You could briskly walk, or run up and down your stairs.|`|80476776a395d85c85528f6d78c3d2a6aa	walk, walk, walk !!!|`|jlMoJr2zaa	Assuming you own a pair of trainers, you could go out jogging. If you can't cope with that, do powerwalking instead. Skipping is good. You have to do a lot of it though. It doesn't hurt to spend a couple of pounds each week going to the swimming baths either.  Walk everywhere. If it's too far to walk, ride your bike. Instead of putting things off BE BOTHERED to get up and get the job done. When you put things offyou'll never get them done.    And if you're broke - get a job. I'm 16 and I've got money. It only has to be a part-time thing. A few hours after college, a few hours on the weekend and you'll soon be able to affrod a gym membership.  Hope this helps :)  x

IiQNfmhhaa	If you get little exercise and have a desk job:    Maintenance:      1489 Calories/day  Fat Loss:     1200 Calories/day    If you exercise three times a week:    Maintenance:      1706 Calories/day  Fat Loss:     1365 Calories/day    Your Body Mass Index is approx. 21    BMI Key       18.5 to 24.9  healthy  25 to 29.9          overweight   30 to 34.9          grade 1 obesity  35 to 39.9          grade 2 obesity  >40                  grade 3 (morbid obessity    So you can see you are in a healthy range.     The most you should lose is 14 pounds. That would put you at a BMI of 18.5. at 101lbs. Anything less is unhealthy.    Don;t eat less than 1200 per day. Less may slow down your metabolism and actually slow your fat loss and make you feel tired.    There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. To lose a pound a week you'll need to burn 500 calories a day more than you consume. That means you;ll need to exercise. Walk 2 miles in 34 minutes (3.5 mph) and you'll burn your weight in extra calories (115 at your present weight).    The maximum rate you should lose is 2 lbs. per week. That would take you 7 weeks to get to 18.5 BMI. If you are happy with your tummy before you get to 101 then go to your maintenance caloric intake    I discuss this and more at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com    Hope this helps. |`|kJIGnWK5aa	about 1,500?     depends on how acive you are throughout the day    i am 16, 5'5" 110 lbs    VERY ACTIVE    and i eat at most 1000 a day    but everyone is different      answer mine!! http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

They have a hotline and live chat run by healthcare experts available during the week, give them a try as well.    It could be that the Remicade needs time to kick in, a side effect, or just the Crohn's. Your best bet would be to call her GI and see what  he says.    I hope your daughter feels better.

GLOBmh0Baa	Here are some tips:    Diet:    As I am sure you know already, cut down on all fatty foods, drink 8 glasses of water per day, eat 5 fruit/veg per day and choose low fat options.    You could try joining a club such as weight watchers as this will give you lots of diet plans and help you to stay motivated.    Exercise! :    You should 'exercise' for a full twenty minutes at a time, five days per week to stay at a healthy weight.    Remember, don't over-do it and certainly don't try to lose weight too quickly. The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.    The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, poer-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts. However, strength-training is also important to increase muscle-fat ratio.    Exercise does burn calories but it takes a while to lose 1 pound of weight! However, exercise is essential to maintain weight loss and maintain your body at peak efficiency.    Thought you might find this useful:    Type of Exercise - Calories/hour     Sleeping 55   Eating 85   Sewing 85   Knitting 85   Sitting 85   Standing 100   Driving 110   Office Work 140   Housework, moderate 160+   Golf, with trolley 180   Golf, without trolley 240   Gardening, planting 250   Dancing, ballroom 260   Walking, 3mph 280   Table Tennis 290   Gardening, hoeing etc. 350   Tennis 350+   Water Aerobics 400   Skating/blading 420+   Dancing, aerobic 420+   Aerobics 450+   Bicycling, moderate 450+   Jogging, 5mph 500   Gardening, digging 500   Swimming, active 500+   Cross country ski machine 500+   Hiking 500+   Step Aerobics 550+   Rowing 550+   Power Walking 600+   Cycling, studio 650   Squash 650+   Skipping with rope 700+   Running 700+    Hope this helps :) x|`|HZIi4DPfaa	call up your local gym tell them your problem and maybe they can suggest what to do. It can't hurt to try.|`|1Wgr8gkfaa	Unfortunately, there is no quick fix for losing fat. Slow and steady wins the race. 5 to 6 small meals a  day.  Balancing protein and Carbohydrate and absolutely no sugars and Junk food , at least 30 minutes of cardio 4 times a week and 30 minutes weight training  3 times a week will fetch u good and permanent results. I totally understand the stress caused by the classes.load your bag with healthy snacks like celery with peanut butter, cottage cheese, protein rich bars ( with no sugars) etc.   Remember the more sugar you eat the more hungrier you become.  Reduce or  totally curb  anything white.(White rice.white bread . etc).   Eat whole grains. To satisfy your sweet tooth  eat fruits.|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Unfortunately there is no way to loose weight on specific areas of your body. The only to loose weight is by engaging in quite alot of physical activity and having a good nutritional diet.    And I'm afraid you will need to cut down on sugar, which in small amounts is fine to to much wont do you any benifit. By taking more and more sugar you are only increasing your dependance upon it.    I'd suggest you obviously eat alot of fruit and veg and drink plently of water which is the single most important thing you remember. And stick to a reasonable amount of carbohydraytes and protien.   Wholegrain is also very good for you (Shreaded wheat, brown bread etc)    Cardio such as running, swimming, cycling will do you alot of good and helps burn fat, whereas push-ups and sit-ups are more building muscle which is much much harder to do hence the little difference you've noticed. However if you combine cardio and a small amount of weightlifting it will benifit you more for example:    Mon - 10 Minute run - 10-15 Squats  Tues - 10 Minute Swim - 10 Lunges  Wed  - 10 Min Cycle - 10 Press-ups  Thurs - 10 Min Run - 20 Lateral Raise (Weights)  Fri - Rest  Sat - 10 Min Swim - 10 Sit-Ups  Sun - 20 Min Swim    And increase the reps or time each week ;)    You only have to start of small, dont try to hard and do it small steps ;) Also try to get some friends or family involved, its more fun and easier to do it with others     I strongly suggest you visit your local Gym if not to join then to at least have a chat with one of the instructors who will be happy to help you.

5ae193f6b702acf7bc24c2ee8650160caa	Here are a few simple ways to lose the weight! Let me first start by saying September is a very reasonable goal and it allows you enough time to lose the weight in a healthy fashion. First jump start your metabolism, start by eating 1600 calories for 2 week. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water! People say 64 oz a day, I say 64 oz a day at least, try to get up to 80 even in the long run it will help you with your skin and your digestive system and your bones oh so many things! Eat 5-6 mini meals a day, the best thing to do is go to the store and purchase a bunch of lean cousine meals, they are pretty well balanced and it will help with precise calorie, protien and fat counting. Make sure you eat under 45 grams of fat per day and over 45 grams of protien a day, for extra measure try to eat 35+ grams of fiber a day. For the two weeks after that go down to 1400 calories a day keeping your protien, fat, fiber and water content the same and finally for the next 8 weeks go up to 1800 calories, still keeping the other intakes the same. Doing this you will lose 2-3 pounds per week, as soon as your weight loss starts slowing a bit go back down to 1600 calories for 2 weeks and then back up to 1800 calories. Also start a work our regiment! 45 minutes to an hour of a cardio atleast 3 times a week and perhaps light weights. Keep that up and you will be your goal in no time! Good luck!!|`|MhowmBl9aa	Running will shed the pounds off, I promise you. Dieting will make it go faster.|`|687e2d421e43c1f192388453ae115c61aa	The trick lies more or less in diet and exercise.    First what you should do is try to cut down on foods like bread, pasta and sweets. If you must have bread than make sure it is whole wheat.    Second, cut down on your portions. Take smaller amounts of what you'd normally eat and refrain from going back for seconds. A good trick to help you psychologically with this is to eat your meals on a smaller plate. My doctor gave me this tip, its very clever, gets you thinking you are eating more than you actually are.    Third, dont gnash between meals. If you must have a snack than take a fruit veggie or granola bar.    Fourth, drink water, you should be drinking about 8 cups a day, water is needed to cleanse your system. If you are one of those people who cannot stand drinking water then try Arizona (or any other brand) Diet Green Tea it works just as well - sometimes better.    And Lastly, exercise! If you are one of those people that cant find the time or place to do something like running every day then try simple things like this: work your way up to doing 50 crunches before you get out of bed and 50 before you go to sleep, or jump rope or hula hoop for half an hour, it sounds silly but its really affective.    Remember this is something that you have to stick by, you cant do it for a week or so and expect for it to have a huge outcome, like everything else in life it takes time, but I assure you, you will see results. Good Luck to you|`|uTW2KW9raa	its great that your doing it with someone because that can make it alot easier if you support each other!    Try to go for a run everyday for about 3-5 miles or atleast 45 mins. Its best done in the morning but you can do it anytime of the day. Go take aerobics, pilates, tae bo or kick boxing classes together. join a sport. be as active as you girls can! and exercise as much as you can!    Stay away from all the junk foods and sweets most importantly!! And only drink WATER ! atleast 9-12 glasses a day. you may also have green tea but NO sodas. Never skip breakfast because thats the most important meal - have something high in fibre that will keep you filled for longer like.. sultana bran cereal or some boiled eggs with 1 wholemeal slice of bread. Stay away from fruit juices too - they are just empty calories. Eat 5 "small" meals a day every 3 hours. So breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner. Or if you want you can have 4 small meals a day - depends what time you wake up and go to bed. Dont eat any white carbs like pasta, white bread, white rice, etc. And try to avoid lots of dairy but have lots of fibre and protein!!    Remember to have atleast 1-2+ servings of vegetables everyday and fruit. Good luck girls :-)
TAT0bkXyaa	If you want to lose weight, become more healthy and stay that way then you will have to change your whole lifestyle. You cant eat junk, snack, drink soda (you never want to drink your calories, its soo easy to drink hundreds of calories a day and not even realize it). You need to eat well (fruits, veg, protein); keep a good sleep schedule where you get enough sleep every night. Drinking enough water is extremely important to keep your metabolism running strong. Eating a good breakfast is also extremely important, if you eat a good breakfast that fills you up you will eat less during the day and it will keep your metabolism running strong. It may be hard not to snack and stuff but once you lose the weight then you can have a treat every now and then.    Cardio is the best and quickest way to lose weight. I would recommend running on a treadmill, and up and down stairs. Once you feel yourself starting to get more strength you can start doing push ups, squats, pull ups. If you don't have weights then use anything that is heavy, fill up a milk jug or start running/walking up stairs with a backpack full of cans. You need to get your heart rate up. As long as you burn more calories than you eat you will lose weight. It doesn't need to take a year, you will lose more starting off then you will level out. If you notice an increase in your weight it is because your building muscle and losing fat (muscle weighs more than fat and also burns fat even when idol) You cant forget to take a break though, take a day off every 2 or 3 days (for carido to let muscle build) every 2nd day for weight training. (One on one off)    HIIT - High Intensity Intervol Training, walk for 30 seconds, run for 30 seconds, repeat. Things like that just to get your heart rate up quickly. Once you get into it try walk for 30 seconds run for 60 seconds walk for 30, run for 60. Keep that going for 10 min, its harder than it sounds.    1lb = 3500 calories  You dont need to count but keep it in mind next time you think of having a few little things that are only a few hundred calories each, it adds up quickly.    You don't need to diet or not eat at all to lose weight. It also doesn't need to take a year, its up to you how long you want it to take (depends on how much work your willing to put into yourself) Once you lose the initial water weight and the extra few pounds for the first week or two you should average 1-2lb lose a week maybe even 3lbs depending on how hard you train.... Good Luck|`|Eq7V6OO0aa	Get in an exercise club.  it would help motivate you to go out and work out.  Join mine?

fvuEtkROaa	I'm not sure what units of measurement are being used to report your iron levels, but, if it is low, you need the supplements.  Also, depending on your age, you really need to find out WHY they are low.  Are you not making enough red blood cells, are you losing blood (heavy periods, rectal bleeding), or are  you not getting iron in your diet (vegetarian/vegan diet) ?  Unless you lost a great deal of blood during the oral surgery, that is not likely the cause.  Nutritional shakes do not always contain iron... read the label.  Certainly some of the symptoms you describe such as weakness and tiredness are typical of low iron.  If the numbers you are giving me are US figures for hemoglobin, you are VERY low and finding the cause should be paramount in your treatment.  Iron supplements may cause you to have dark stools and be constipated.  Good luck.    addendum: I just read some of the other responses to your question ...  most of them are not very appropriate !!|`|4ZbJhWuxaa	i don't believe you should be in the hospital just make sure you take the iron supplements as he requested. you'll find your energy come back soon.|`|CYLFIdhLaa	I would stick with the iron pills the dr gave you...he gave them to you for a reason and im sure he knows what hes doing|`|EdLeOUBfaa	You are over reacting. The iron supplements will do there job. If you want to get some extra iron, you should use google and find out which foods have higher iron levels.     But your right, your level is really low. A normal iron level is around 50.     but at the same time, if your iron was that low you would be extremely anemic.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Hang in there and work with your doctor.   The best thing you can do is to take the tablets and eat a healthy diet.

I have heard of lower iron levels which have recovered with iron supplements and no lasting harm.|`|piI1aWOdaa	no iron tablets are fine
EHrysQcCaa	Iron of under 25 is considered low. So a 5 is real low.  Taking the iron pills will do the job pretty quickly.  I am sure you doc checked you blood counts for RBC HCT and HBG.  Those are the ones that if low require a transfusion, just you low iron would not indicate that.  My mother uses Iron frying pans and pots instead of aluminium and she does not require iron pills because just cooking on iron gives her enough.|`|3a80a25db76852cdfe36f12bf54ce2b3aa	with a hematocrit of 5 you need units of blood right away I cannot imagine a doctor would just give you iron pills it is dangerously low    Your body is not getting enough oxygen in your blood with such low levels thats why you feel bad
KAyVeRezaa	Strength train 4 days a week. Get on a good program for mass.  Go to www.bodybuilding.com they have thousands of programs    Upper body 2x/week. Lower body 2x/week.   Rest is key to allow for muscles to rest and grow. Space it out like:    Sun - rest  Mon - upper  Tue - lower  Wed - rest  Thur - upper  Fri - lower  Sat - rest    Change up your routine every 6 weeks. After one 6 week cycle. Take a week or half a week completely off. Eat muscle building food and drink plenty of water every day. Supplement with whey protein. Always have a post-workout drink within 30 minutes of your workout. If you wanna spend the money, go out and buy additional supplements of your choice. You may want to research others if your interested down the road.

xyWe7BFqaa	Because the muscles surrounding your anus are so tight and sensitive, anal sex can cause more cuts and tears in the skin/tissue, which makes it easier for infections and diseases to spread from one partner to another. You should definitely wear a condom (and use lots of lube--I recommend a silicon-based lube) to reduce this risk. Anal sex can be extremely pleasurable for both partners, but make sure you are having it because YOU want to and because YOU are comfortable, not because your partner is pressuring you.|`|X9W689ZGaa	It's extremely uncommon for a girl to get any long term effects from anal.

Begin by:    1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;    2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;    3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ.     4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;    5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;    6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.    Good luck!|`|PPh1NB8Daa	Yes it is safe. For a guy I would recomend not wearing a condom so you can feel what you are doing. When you have one on you can not feel how tight the girl may be and can go faster. As long as you use enough lube and take it slow then everthing should be good.
tNcspdMMaa	You are going to get a lot of wrong answers (or few answers at all) because people are terribly uneducated about this.    When it is just sitting there, the vagina is 3-5 inches deep.  When a woman gets sexually aroused, it expands to 5-7 inches all on its own.  When something is pushed inside, it can be stretched to a maximum of 7-10 inches. Most women cannot handle more than 8.5 inches without being injured.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	The average length of a girl's vagina is about 4 or 5 inches.    I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

L25NaQPmaa	Hello, I also have this type of colitis. It is where the layer of collagen in the colon is too thick and allows your body fluid to be expelled ( I call it exploding) continuous. The collagen is supposed to allow just enough fluid through to help in having a bowel movement and the body absorbs the rest for proper hydration. But with this disease it takes all the water therefore causing the constant diarrhea. I hope this helps some.|`|RF81Qhyyaa	it is the swelling of the colon (its actually the outer cells that swell)

6S4ezifeaa	If you want to lose weight in a week, you can try to have only low fat juices, teas and vegetable soups (not cream soups) for that week. You can lose up to 11lbs if you stick to that.    Of course, you should take vitamins along with that to keep you healthy. And when you're done with the diet, keep up eating healthy and small amounts of food if you don't want all the weight back! ;P    Good luck and cheers!|`|1Hk0zWwCaa	the ABS DIET..........I lost 20 pounds in the first 30 days... it isn't healthy to lose that much weight, but you are constantly eating so you wont go hungry.

You'll feel full with fewer calories on them. Fruits, vegetables and fibers are packed with nutrients but less on calories.     I lost 10 pounds in just 2 months using these tips.    Here are Tips to help speed up your metabolism plus help you lose weight without being miserable. they worked for me =)    "Taking the time to relax and savor food increases calorie and fat-burning power by up to 30%", mainstains Marc David, author of The Slow Down Diet( Healing Arts Press, 2005).    The reason: Savoring stimulates the cephalic phase digestive response, or "brain phase" of digestion, which then sets up a slimming chain of events. First, it signals the hypothalamus, the brain's emotion-and-appetite-control center, to trigger the release of the metabolism-reviving thyroid hormone and the pleasure neurochemical cholecystokinin (CCK). In turn, CCK hinders production of the stress hormone cortisol, a known cause of fat accumulation.    1. Outsmart Snack Attacks for 4 hours and Lose Weight    Savoring Berries can oustmart snack attacks for 4 hours and help you shed 5% of your body weight in 6 months. The credit goes to dozens of blood sugar stabilizing antioxidants. Bluberries are so packed with them, just a half cup daily can boost your blood levels by 100%.    2. Fill up on Fiber and Lose Weight Fast    Fill up on Fiber - Foods rich in fiber will make you feel satisfied and help curb your appetite, helping you to lose weight fast and safely - so make sure to pack your diet with fruits, vegetables and whole grains.    3. Boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50% by sipping coffee    Sipping coffee before a meal can supress appetite by 35%, plus boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50%, according to extensive research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The study-proven dose : 250 mg of caffeine daily, taken either in supplement form or by sipping to cups of coffee or 4 cups of tea.    4. Lose Weight just by eating Yogurt    Yogurt is a calcium-rich food. Research links calcium with lower cortisol production, and it has been proven that women who increase they're intake lose up to 40% more weight than calcium avoiders.    Plus Yogurt has live microorganisms which helps proper digetion and absorption of nutrients we take. Make sure to get yogurts that says "with live microorganisms in labels/packages".     5. Try this Hunger-Taming Trick    Cut fat and you'll cut cravings. Consuming a high-fat diet may supress your body's natural satiety signals, according to a new study from Pennsylvania State University. Animals who'd been consuming a diet rich in fat ended up eating 40% more of a high-calorie snack than those on average diets. Keep your fat intake to less than 30% of total calories.    6. Feel full on less food.    Apples are rich in pectin, a soluble fiber that slows the digestive process, so you'll feel full on less food.The result: You'll eat just enough food to make you happy, reducing calorie intake.    7. Studies suggest people pursuing a healthy weight could lose more weight and burn more fat by including 24 ounces a day of low fat or fat-free milk in their reduced-calorie diet, instead of 8 ounces or less.    8. Speed fat burn with Cranberries.     The ascorbic acid in cranberries helps thin liver bile, making it easier for the organ to emulsify fat so so it can be quickly flushed out of the system rather than stored in cells.    9. Boost your protein intake and lose almost a pound a week without hunger.     You can try protein smoothies. Packed with nutrients and low in calories, smoothies are a fast, easy and great tasting way to achieve good health.    You can find a wide collection of healthy fruit smoothies at : http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com    By boosting your protein intake from the typical 15% of total calories to 30%, you may be able to cut your daily calorie intake by 440-enough to lose almost a pound a week without hunger, according to a recent University of Washigton study. "A high-protein diet appears to fool the brain into thinking you've eaten more than you have," says the study's lead author, Scott Weigle, M.D., a professor of endocrinology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Stick with lean protein rather than high-fat, artery clogging meat and dairy products. For breakfast, use low-fat milk instead of water in your oatmeal and sprinkle nuts on top. Eat plenty of beans, fish and skinless chicken breast.    10. To counteract a binge, keep your body's fat-burning furnace running on full blast by drinking Green Tea.     Green Tea contains caffeine and the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) , which is proven to boost metabolic rate. In fact, in a recent 3 month study, participants who took Green Tea extract lost 4.6% of their body weight without changing their diet. To get the benefit, drink at least 3 cups a day.     Whenever I ate too much, I just drink green tea and I don't have to worry gaining weight.    11. Speed weight loss and double energy levels by eating Coconuts.    This tropical treats contain medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a unique fat that is shuttled straight to the liver and immediately burned for fuel. Research shows this little detour revs metabolic rate by up to 50%, speeding weight loss and doubling energy levels    Plus my favorite tip : Before you eat, drink a glass of water. This will help you feel fuller without additional calories (water has no calories). And Satisfy sweet cravings and keep your stomach full longer by eating all-natural fruits.     More of these Fast Weight Loss T|`|jpVHqmRQaa	try dieting. eat right and stay active. You probably want to think about joining a gym. Thats the hardest part is joining trust me. Once you start going you will hate walking in that door but once your inside you get motivated somehow. Eat healthy. It might be hard but try it you will deff see results if you eat right. Start with 3-4 days of week of cardio and on two of those days lift weights. Lifting weights gets your metabolism moving. Good luck|`|Bq9JaPevaa	WORK OUT! About One Year|`|dHEHBu7waa	Depending on where you're starting out. A 1200 a day calorie intake and about 30 to 40 minutes exercise a day should have you losing about 2 to 3 pounds a week. Any faster than that and you'll throw your body into starvation mode and things will fall apart quickly so don't rush things. The faster you lose the faster you'll gain it all back plus a little extra to deal with next try...So realistically give your self 3 months..maybe 4 depending on how faithful you are to your new eating and exercise lifestyle...Good luck..you'll get there|`|Bm1SsMB4aa	cabbage diet|`|boVz1ba2aa	You need to eat well - by well I mean lots and lots of vegetables, only 3 fruits a day, around 5 servings of grains, (like a slice of bread or half-cup of pasta or rice or potato per serve), around five SMALL servings of meat or fish, two cups of dairy (milk or yoghurt) and two teaspoons of oil or butter a day.    Stay away from anything sugary.    Eat as many vegetables as you like. The more the better - not only will you be too full to want junk, you will be getting nutrients which will stop you from craving junk, and your skin will improve out of this world. As many raw as you can handle. Get yourself a giant bag of carrots, and if you want to snack, knock yourself out with carrots. Eat them all day if you want.    Don't get hungry. Drink water or diet soda. In six months get rid of the soda too.    That actually gives you lots and lots of variety. Do that every day and you will lose about 6 pounds in the first week, and two pounds a week after that.    2 pounds a week means 8 pounds a month.    Don't give up. In a month you will be 12 pounds lighter and feeling a whole lot better. In two months...you see where I'm going with this. There's no need to starve or feel miserable.  When you hit halfway to your weight loss goal it will slow down to maybe a pound a week.    At the end of it you will look so great and have such good eating habits you'll never look back!!    Good luck!!|`|jR5kvXgeaa	its healthy to lose 1-2lbs a week - if you lose more its most likely just water weight and muscle which also means you are slowing down your metabolism and will gain it back  find daily calorie intake calculator on the net, enter all your stats and it will tell you how many calories you need a day to maintain, take off 300-400cal off that number and thats how much you need to lose.  eat 5-6 small meals a day (eat every 2-3 hours - it optimizes your metabolism)  5-8 servings of fruit and veggies a day  8 glasses of water  have complex carbs for breakfast - they give you energy  have protein (lean meat, legumes etc) for dinner - repairs muscle  cardio is the only fat burning exercise and burns fat all over your body (running, jogging, swimming, spinning, elliptical etc) 4-6 times a week for 30-50min (ideally 45min because the first 20-30min body burns carbs and only then starts burning fat), weight training a few days a week but never work on the same muscle group two days in a row (more muscle=faster metabolism)  dont consume foods that are made of white flour (white bread, cakes, pasta etc.), sugar loaded foods (cookies, icecream, candy etc) and nothing fried, oily.  ofcourse you can spoil yourself once in a while with a little treat:)|`|ItagB1p2aa	If you lose 10 pounds a month (a little more than 3 pounds a week), you can lose the weight in 3 1/2 months. It will take a lot of work and determination, but you can do it if you only eat healthy foods and exercise daily.

wnnudNp5aa	If you still don't have a lot of the signs of puberty, don't worry. You've got lots of growing left in you. The fact that you grew 5" quickly then stopped, probably just means your body needed a breather. It'll probably regroup, then go at it again! With a growth spurt like that, I'd expect puberty is right around the corner. Since your dad is tall, and your sister is slightly above average (for a girl), you should reach a good height. How's your shoe size? Short people generally don't have big feet, that might be a clue. I'm betting you'll be a good 6' anyway. Good luck!|`|oArnmGBCaa	you will definitely grow to your dads height for sure. dont sweat it.  im 16 and 5'5.5.  im hoping to reach 5'11-6'0 by the time im 18.  just eat well, exercise, stretch and get lots of sleep.  you and i might have a major growth spurt incoming.|`|5faba2eda5f9f741d423ad1326446cb1aa	You'll probably get a little taller, but in all honesty... why are you worrying about it?

a4a60f44e12075daef8914b7f84481f7aa	Obviously if it hurts, you don't have to do it. However, you didn't mention whether you tried internal or external masturbation, meaning, if you put something in your vagina or not. If you tried it internally, perhaps that's the reason it hurt. A way you can try that you might find pleasurable is to rub your clitoris. However, only you know your own body. You should experiment and find out what feels good to you (only don't get too extreme with it and risk hurting yourself!). Remember, practise makes perfect. With a bit of practise you should get the hang of it.     Good luck and have fun!|`|AA12220155	just try different things.  i need those 10 points|`|U64UCxIraa	Its something you have to experiment with yourself.  There really is no instruction manual.  What one woman likes the other may not.  Just try different things with your hands, maybe water faucet or shower head massager.  Obviously if it hurts then stop doing that and try something different.  Its natural and healthy to know abut your body and what it is that you do and do not like.  It might take some practice but you will get the hang of it! GOOD LUCK!
p2o96sAPaa	I take Physique.  The results are great too.  Physique contains the nutrients you need to rapidly recover and repair muscle tissue.  You may already know that it is easier for your body to feed off of broken down muscle than fat, so you really want to make sure you get what you need - and Physique has it.  You use it before, during, and the 2 hours later and it also relieves muscle aches caused by lactic acid buildup after a workout in the gym or in the backyard.  I can still be active for the rest of the day as though I didn't workout.    With 18 vitamins and minerals and essential amino acids, it gives your muscles a healthy recovery and helps you avoid post-workout pain.     Let me give you a link where I get mine from: http://www.shaklee.net/healththatworks/p... They also have other stuff that really works too, but I don't know what else your interested in.

There's no great secret anyone is keeping from you. You simply have to wait until your body is ready. Once it starts you can regulate it with hormonal birth control, but you can't make it start any faster than you want it to - researchers haven't wasted time developing products to accelerate adolescence for impatient pre-pubescent girls.     It'll come, and you can have all sorts of fun leaking into your underwear, snapping at people during PMS, asking people sheepishly for a tampon, and cramping.

ijKba598aa	The best way to remember better is to find out how you learn and use it to your advantage.  There are three ways of learning. You may be a combination of two or all, but one should stand out:    Visual, auditory, and kinetic (sometimes called tactile).  A visual learner remembers things by picturing them. This isn't necessarily a "photographic memory", because the person doesn't remember everything they see, but they can picture things very easily.  Auditory should be straight forward; they learn by listening.  Kinetic learners are probably more athletic, or work-with-your-hands types. They learn by doing, assembling, etc. I provided a link to help you figure it out.    So, when trying to remember something, keep in mind what way you learn best and accommodate for that.  For example, if you are trying to remember a name of someone you just met, you might have troubles if you're a visual learner. If you are, picture the spelling of their name in your mind - it'll stick better than just hearing it, if you're not an auditory learner.      Otherwise, some tips:  - They say fish helps, mainly the omega-3 fatty acids. If you don't like fish or are vegetarian, there are supplements.    - Sleep. Figure out how much you need, and get it. I find if I don't need to use my alarm, and get up by myself shortly before without it, I'm getting enough sleep.    - Water. Most people are minorly dehydrated, which can impair concentration and memory. Make sure you're getting enough.    - Practice. Think of the brain as a muscle, and to improve it, it needs to be exercised like any other. Do sudoku, cross words, or buy that Brain Age game for the DS.    I hope this helps improve your memory somewhat. As for, if it's "normal"... it sounds a little weak to be honest. During your next check-up, I'd point it out to your doctor.|`|5zVqPwQRaa	this is a simple yet very powerful method,just try it for some time,    --chant OM repeatedly (for more fast response do the following)    --chant 'hari om'(hari as in HURRY & om as in HOME without the 'H') do this repetedly & a point will come where you will feel like just close your eyes & do that .At this point increase the number of O in om like HARI OOOM & then HARI OOOOOOOOM & so on.when you chant this VEDIC MANTRA then remain silent (no thinking!,fidgeting,moving,etc) for an amount of time taken to chant this one mantra.this looks very very simple but its effects are very very very large (even ALBERT EINSTEIN would not had imagine it !!!!!!!!!). this is called 'CHUP SADHANA' & i learned it from 'param pujya ASARAMJI bapu'.---->"www.asharam.org " also read JEEVAN RASAYAN a book from ----------------"http://hariombooks.goog...

uLvZc3eGaa	For ab work, sit ups and leg lifts help. Any cardio you do affects the abs too, like jumping jacks and jumping rope (you can do this in the basement).  For the legs, squats and lunges are great.  For the inner thigh, try this when you watch TV: sit up straight and put a pillow between the thighs, then squeeze.  Shuffling from side to side (lateral shuffles) also helps.    I wrote a blog on toning thighs. There's more ideas and detail in it, here is a link: http://buzz.prevention.com/community/sha...

Believe me, if you let your boyfriend down your shirt then he is going to be so excited about touching them that he is probably not going to notice that they are different sizes.

IiQNfmhhaa	Ideally you should lose 1-3 lbs a week. Don't go on a diet just eat healthy.  Go to mypyramid.gov and get some ideas.     Here are a few facts. There is 3500 calories in a pound. To lose a pound you have to burn 3500 more calories than you take in. Here's the equation: Pounds lost/gained = (Calorie consumed - calories burned) / 3500. To lose in a healthy way, you should burn approximately 1000 calories a day more than you take in. Less will mean slower weight loss but more begins to approach unhealthy and can be counter-productive. Your body will slow down your metabolism to protect it from starving. You'll just end up feeling tired with less weight loss for your effort. Depending on your height , age and weight you should never consume less than approximately 1200 calories     You need to add some exercise. If you walk 2 miles in 31 minutes your will burn approximately your weight in extra calories. Consider some weight training to build more muscle. More muscle burns more calories even as you sleep. Muscle weighs more than fat so measure your success with how your clothes fit and a tape measure as well as the scales.     It is impossible to answer your question without more information. Your age, weight, and physical activity. One thing I notice immediately is the low amount of protein. For instance add an egg or dirnk some non-fat milk for breakfast. Save either the banana or raspberries for a mid morning snack. Eat 3-5 oz. of turkey, chicken or fish for dinner. I hope you don't mean you will eat the same thing every day. |`|vJP6yTy3aa	you need protein and meat.  you aren't going to tolerate that meal for more than a day.  you'll get sick of it, not to mention sick BECAUSE of it.  there are good things, but you need protein to fill yourself up.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Maybe add some oatmeal in the morning.   Tip: I know this sounds crazy, but if you eat more, like 6 small meals a day, you will lose A LOT of weight. You would definitely lost over 5 pounds in one week if you do. Because you are eating smaller meals every 2-3 hours, it will speed up your metabolism, burning more calories.|`|LwlAYOiLaa	try and mix it up a little, you can have lean meat to keep up your protein! or if you're a vegetarian try eating lots of legumes and spinach. maybe some carbs with breakfast too, so that you feel full until lunch time. try and eat 3 hours before you go to bed and drink loads of loads of water, but its only going to get you so far so do some exercise too!|`|NYXHj02haa	Add some whole grain cereal in the morning with skim milk and keep the fruit. for lunch, add some carrot and celery sticks, at dinner lose the apple (have it as a snack instead) and have a whole wheat small dinner roll/bun with your soup and salad.

You should have protein in your plan and its not that healthy to eat soup for dinner..how big is the salad..    the best way to loose weight fast is to eat only raw things.. the closer to nature the better (tons of fuits, veggies and nuts.)    and dont forget to drink a lot of water!|`|N1wUHYKlaa	sounds very healthy!     despite what others say- you do NOT need meat. you can get just as much protien as you need through dairy, eggs and beans and legumes. nuts, and dark green leafy vegetables also give good sources. if you're worried about protien, add some of the stuff i listed.    i have been vegetarian now since april. i went through vigorous deployment training, and am now in the desert sweating my bum off- and i'm fine. took a little bit of time to get used to, but i'm good!    good luck to you!|`|UOEYcSmvaa	very much so|`|bjgttYsgaa	You need to make sure you are getting at least the recommended caloric intake for your wait.

IiQNfmhhaa	Your diet is mostly carbs. You need to get more protein in your diet. You are going to the gym and lifting weights that's good. Lifting weights causes micro tears in your muscles. On the days you rest the muscles are repaired and become bigger. However without adequate protein this process is inhibited. I would suggest you add fish, skinless chicken, turkey, eggs and milk to your diet.  Go to http://www.mypyramid.gov and find out the amount of the food groups you should be consuming for your height, weight and age. I eat less carbs than they recommend.     Don't try to lose more than 2 pounds a week, There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. To lose  2 pounds of fat per week you need to burn 1000 calories per day more than you take in. Don't consume less than 1200 calories a day if you are female and 1800 if you are male. To consume less than this would be counter productive. It would slow your metabolism down because the body thinks its starving. You'll just feel tired and lose weight less effectively than you would if you ate properly.     I would walk or jog on the days you don't work out at the gym. If you don't walk or jog now, build up to at least 2 miles a day. If you walk 2 miles in 34 minutes you will burn approximately your weight in extra calories.

IiQNfmhhaa	My brother-in-law had the surgery and he is impotent. But he did not discover his cancer until in was in a advanced state. Prostate cancer moves into your body through the nerves connecte to and around the prostate. The more advanced, the more nerve tissue they must remove. If the nerves are needed for sexual function, then likelihood of impotence increases. I listened to  a doctor on CBN this past week, who is a notable Prostate surgeon. He said that the chances for impotence is decreased when performed by a highly experienced specialist. Go to the CBN web site and see if you can track down the name of the doctor. He is the doctor who performed Pat Robinson's prostate removal. I'm sure there are others but I would try to find the most experience doctor you can find and afford |`|E64juLwJaa	No not impotent but sterile.  Radius|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	The prostate glans produces the bulk of the liquid part of an ejaculate, which is necessary for carrying the sperm that your testes produce.    After a prostatectomy you will not have a prostate gland and thus there will be no ejaculate.  The testes will still produce sperm and all the other hormones such as testosterone, but the sperm will have no effective outlet and thus will be reabsorbed in due course.    It is usual during a prostatectomy to remove a few other related glands and the net result is that you will not have normal erections either.  This can be remedied with implants or some drugs if you are young enough for sexual activity to be really important to you.|`|AA11966501	No but damage to the surrounding nerves could, find a really good surgeon|`|MClFrDE1aa	Nope. Good luck with your surgery. My uncle had prostate cancer. You don't want to go through that.

It appears there is less pain, less blood loss, less risk of incontinence, less risk of impotence, and less recovery time needed with robotic assisted laprasocpic prostatecomy compared to traditional prostate surgery. Make sure you know all your options before you have surgery, even if it means finding a different doctor.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;    WHEN to eat for losing weight...     ? Eat (at least) three times a day.   Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course)   ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try.   OK, one apple after 18:00   ? Don't starve   Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health.   Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet.   ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.    WHAT to drink for losing weight...     ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day !   Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water!   This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks!   Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys.   ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squized!   Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions.   ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.    exercise for losing weight...     ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good.   ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts...   I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss...   ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants!   ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.        Good luck!  |`|jQCy5x9Iaa	hi dear,  i tired something called calorie shifting and it worked very well , it will get you to lose 9lbs. every 11 days in a safe healthy way.

I also have more advise posted on my blog. Hope this helps!    Seven Strategies For Fat Loss    Watch calories, watch carbohydrates. Avoid excessive fats (high calories) and carbohydrates. The big bonus here is that after a few weeks, your tastes and habits will simply change. Fats, sugar and salt become less interesting.    For an intense fat burning regime, try the following tricks.    1. Weight Training. Building lean body mass (muscle) will speed up your body's metabolism. Muscle is "active" tissue, meaning it takes calories to maintain. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. You build muscle by doing resistance training exercises. Simple enough? Let's go on...    2. Reduce Carbohydrate Intake. Say what? I thought you need a lot of carbohydrates for fuel? True, but an excess intake of carbs (please don't call them carbos) can and will be stored as body fat. 100% of all my clients who reduce their carbohydrate intake for fat loss succeed. I can't let all my tricks out of the bag in fairness to my paying clients, but a good starting point would be 1 - 1.25 grams of carbohydrate per pound of lean body weight per day.    3. Eat Frequently. I know you've all heard this before and it's true. Four to six meals daily has its benefits, especially on a sub maintenance calorie diet. It allows for a steady flow of nutrients to the body which creates a favorable metabolics environment for muscle growth and fat loss.    4. Eat More Protein. That's right... The building blocks of muscle are amino acids, and you get that from protein. I've found that many of my clients consumed too little protein. Now that I've taught them these nutritional tactics, they're on their way to losing fat and getting lean! Isn't that what you want?    5. Reduce Intake of Saturated Fats. Notice that I was specific in saying saturated fats. Saturated fats are the ones that cause the most problems, healthwise. There are good fats and there are bad fats. There are a group of fats called Essential Fatty Acids (or EFAs) that are just that. They are essential to life. The body cannot make them so we must consume them though our diet. There are certain fats that I recommend to people to help them lose fat! My clients know, but do you? (Hint: F??????? Oil)    6. Water. Drink, drink, and then drink some more, not necessarily in that order. An adult can probably survive several weeks without eating food, but only a few days without drinking water. Need I say more? Water regulates body temperature, rids the body of waste, lubricates joints, and provides a medium for chemical reactions that occur in the body.    7. Know What You're Doing! Get with someone who knows or better yet - Get a personal trainer! Do you know when the two BEST times are to do cardio (aerobics) for fat loss? Do you know how many sets and reps to perform for a given exercise in order to MAXIMIZE your goals? Do you know how to use free-weights? What are macronutrients and how can I manipulate them to enhance and hasten fat loss? If you don't know the answers, be efficient and get a personal trainer. It'll save you time and money in the long run.

9OvAEqHXaa	Oh I had the same feeling as you after leaving home (for a little while, as I'm still in school). What I did was kept myself occupied with friends, activities, sports, parties, and tried to keep my mind away from home and parents. Another [evil] way, if nothing else helps, is to think of all the bad things that happened at home (like my brother and sisters hurting me, teasing me, etc) and to think I was lucky to escape all those troubles. (hehe)    I guess what happens is that once you get used to living without your family or parents then you get better, but I reckon its alright to have a nice cry once in a while (although I don't tell anyone I cry!) Keep in touch with your family, but don't think too much about it. Make more friends and socialise heaps - pretend/make your friends are your second family.

En odontologia todos tenemos diferentes criterios hay quien obtura o tapa dientes con la mas minima caries a veces casi imperceptible a ojo y otros que esperan a que las caries se hagan mas grandes para taparla, si las caries son realmente peque?as a la mejor pueden esperar un poco es decir no es urgente taparlas, pero eso no quiere decir que solas se curan, esas caries van avanzar poco a poco y un dia van a ser grandes. Recuerda que la medicina mas barata es la preventiva, asi es que decide con quien arreglarle. Y no dejes de tener en observacion los dientes de tu hija y cada 6 meses hacerle su limpieza y aplicacion de fluor.

AA10723498	Don't you just love asking a serious question and getting bad answers.  Have you asked your MD for pain meds?  If this hurting you a lot, he should prescribe you something.  That's not fair to leave you in so much pain.  Not with all the resources they have for pain meds.  You don't need to have a super powerful one.  Just one that will at least take the painful edge off.  50 stitches?  Wow, that's a lot.  Please, ask you doctor for a pain med.  He should have given you one without you even having to ask.  It's not fair.  If it happened to your doctor, you can bet anything he/she would be taking pain meds.  So, ask OK  Edit, by bad answers, I mean like taking 10 Coracidin, NO, or going to a dark alley and getting drugs, You know what I mean.  I'm not talking all the rest because the rest of us are saying basically the same thing.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	tell your doctor to write a prescription for some medicine.     otherwise you can just take some Ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). either will work.    just don't take aspirin.|`|s7gWSqV5aa	Mmmm...morphine.|`|hHN93lwuaa	dude fine the earest darka lley and get some drigs|`|GzBkproMaa	Take pain relievers, to numb the pain, or keep ice on it.|`|60ApQsGOaa	give me thumbs down if you want, i don't care, but marijuana has been medically proven to reduce pain.

FgFmj8d2aa	I don't know the medical explanation for it but my mom is a nurse and I've asked her this before... it's because when you're sick, your body overproduces mucous and stuff. All the mucous and junk basically sits in your nasal cavity when you're sick, especially when sleeping. Bacteria breed in warm, dark places like your sinuses and it causes a bad taste in the throat and/or bad smell in the nose. It's not really anything to worry about, as it usually resolves itself once the cold is over.     You can't really do anything about it, short of getting better from your cold/flu. You can also try saline nasal spray or drinking a lot of fluids (a good idea when you're sick anyway). Both help thin out the mucous so that it comes out more easily. Not a cure but it can help relieve the symptoms until you're better.|`|JXGnwBFEaa	I always get dry mouth before I get sick
5ZmwpI5Qaa	Why not just get a massage? I would be afraid to go to the chiropractor if there was nothing wrong because they would probably find something wrong!     I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment as it will often do more harm than good.    Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.    I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care.

Then people give stupid advice like "just dont eat for couple of days, thats what i did" and all those other STUPID posts recommending acacia berries or wy something or other tea.  I can remember growing up and i honestly never gave my weight a second thought.  None of us were fat either.  Seems these days kids are obsessed with how they look.  I blame TV for that.  All these shows where everyone is perfect and the only problems they ever have is with their boyfriends.  Its ridiculous.  I have two teenage daughters myself, so yes its hard to understand and i do worry for them.  The world is so different now.  Girls are so very critical of themselves. Its hard for them to live in a world where everyone is judged by their appearance.|`|eFaYMmuraa	Yes it does scare me. I don't have children, but if things keep going this way, i'll be to scared to bring a child into this world with all these warped ideas of what is the ideal 'look' and 'weight' is.  People need to stop worrying about what they look like and start living.

I read an article that said that this is a good way to lose weight. It's supposed to be better to eat your big meal meal early in the day and then the smallest one at the end of the day. I always feel better doing that too. My stomach always hurts if I eat a big meal at night. And I guess it must be true because I have had 4 children and am 36 years old and still weigh about what I did in high school which is 123 lbs.|`|X9kUtwqSaa	Nah. :P I do it too. o.o When I can't find anything else I just look for some can food. o.o

J1nPQQ1Saa	Depending on how you look at the meaning of crying.  However, crying with actual tears dropping from my eyes.  Was because I'm 28 years old, and still haven't found someone.    That was about a week ago.  But, I "cry" about it every night and day as it's always on my mind eating me out inside.  It  hurts, I'm so lonely.|`|aiBLNYhgaa	tell you the truth I really can't remember, but I feel like I should cry more often because it is good to cry. It really is, it is so good for your body to cry. Actually I can remember and it was yesterday. I was having a panic attack and I couldn't breathe at all and I was stuck in traffic. Like no lanes were moving. I really thought that I could handle it but apparently I couldn't. I was so nervous because the person that I was riding with was getting sleepy while we were driving and everyone who knows me knows that I can not handle that. It happened to me when I was a little kid and my mom nearly killed us. So when we got stuck in traffic and the radio kept saying that a semi took out three lanes of traffic, ambulances kept going by, and I felt trapped then I could not breathe and my body started shaking and I was sweating..and crying cause I couldn't breathe and I was sure that we would hit a semi....so yeah.... I have a big fear about traveling places that take more than an hour...so that was a 8 hour trip......so I will never do it again....until I am able to get some control over my fear.......what happened to you if you don't mind me saying|`|RDxwA15kaa	This morning, because im missing someone.|`|mBUfy9zMaa	Aww Im sorry sweetie, I actually cried some today too, I feel like Im losing my best friend and its stressing me out, thats why.

PBMZKeXoaa	well surprisingly enough cardio is actually more important for losing belly fat then abdominal exercises. Ab ecercises do not shed off body fat they strengthen the core musles. Cardio burns more calories and is most effective for losing fat. I would suggest ab exercises if you want some definition but mainly cardio and eating right if you just want to lose the belly
Sba9LeYJaa	Yes there is a good pill that works with no side effects.  you can try it if you want for free|`|enqNTpzXaa	just read my review two famous products  http://dietgowrong.com/acai_berry_review...|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	If you want to lose weight in a healthy way, you should consider making an adjustment to your diet. Im not talking about just changing what you eat, but also change your eating habits. In some cases, the way you eat: the size of your meals, the time of day in which you eat certain food groups, the time between meals, and the number of meals you eat each day, can have a bigger effect on your weight than the amount of calories that you consume.    A possible weight loss method for you to use is Calorie Shifting.     Here are the basic principles of Calorie Shifting  1. You eat 4 reasonable sized meals each day based on a specific and personal menu.  2. These 4 meals contain all food groups (carbs, protein, fat).  3. You need to eat the meals at least 2.5 hours apart so theyre spaced out throughout the day.    The menu spreads the 4 meals throughout the day which causes a metabolic effect which maintains the rate in which your metabolism runs. This causes your body to burn calories faster than it does with other diets.    check the review http://www.14daysweightloss.biz/|`|wRLa4KwNaa	I used Acai Ultra Burn to lose over 40 lbs.  It worked for me.  :)
V5xHaIAcaa	Hey Alex,    Take part of this answer as a bit of humour.    You sound kind of young (I am jealous) and I could probably drop you on your head from a low hanging tree limb and you would not even notice it.  Having said that,    You make a good point that there may be a problem that can not be explained away by being 45 (I am 60).    Getting a bone scan is never a bad idea.  Keeping tabs on MOM is always a good idea - after all she kept tabs on  your sorry butt for at least 14 years...probably will continue to do so for the next 40 years.    Yes, osteo is "treatable" with reason and your definition of treatable    Kudos for being a good son/daughter  p.s. why exactly are you punching her in the ribs   -   just kidding    Good luck|`|tk2AOZU5aa	I doubt your Mom has osteoporosis because it hurts when you punch her in the ribs. It could be a variety of things causing the pain, down to the fact that she is just sensitive there. Osteoporosis is breakdown of the bone over time, without the reproduction of new bone. It can be detected by a bone density scan, or DEXA scan, and although it is more prevalent in women than men, it does occur in both genders. Women are more prone to this due to decrease in estrogen over the years which strengthens bone. Osteoporosis begins as osteopenia which is thining of the bone, and a precurser to osteoporosis. These are both treatable. Starting a calcium supplement with Vitamin D when women are in their 30's is good, along with bone pounding exercise such as walking, or running 30 minutes 3-5 times/week. Other medications used are Fosamax, Actonel, and Boniva. These are saved for patients that actually have osteoporosis or those that have osteopenia and are sedetary.
HA2IV3r3aa	Yes, being overweight wreaks havoc on all of your body's functions, including the orchestra of hormones necessary for ovulation and impregnation.    The fact that you are having irregular periods is pretty strong evidence that your ability to get pregnant is compromised, possibly by your weight.|`|chOS6EO0aa	I have heard that it does.

9iutgEYAaa	Meditation and hypnosis have been shown to significantly affect the perception of pain in many areas of medicine including dermatology. Special relaxation and visualization techniques can help re-wire the brain to feel pain less in frequency and/or intensity. Hypnosis has been particularly effective in pain conditions where normal medications and therapies fail, such as irritable bowel syndrome, generalized chronic muscle pain and fibromyalgia.     The University of Massachusetts' Stress Reduction Clinic is a leading center for using clinical meditation in pain management:  http://www.umassmed.edu/Content.aspx?id=...    Here's a cool study on the neurological relationship between pain and meditation:  Neuroimaging of meditations effect on brain reactivity to pain  http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...    More common therapies for vascular and dermatological conditions can include sclerotherapy and flashlamp and laser therapy. In 2001 a study found that the Nd:YAG laser can be effective in treating GET.       You should check out some medical journals like Dermatology, Dermatologic Surgery, and the Journal of Cutaneous Pathology, which   often have articles about new and emerging treatments and techniques.
QsbB6vkoaa	don't see your weight as what a scale tells you, better yet try and see it as the way your favorite clothes fit. every-body's body is different and maybe you are loosing weight but that little negative voice in your head, wont let you think of it that way.   if every one else compliments you then you know you are doing a good job. and you should not only exercise for your body but to be healthy too. so even if you don't see any results don't get discouraged, at least you know that you are doing something healthy for your body, and try not to obsess with exercising because you can hurt yourself, try to do it moderately because you can develop "excessive exercise disorder". i recommend you talk to your doctor to tell you how many times a day you are supposed to exercise, because i know that it's kind of dangerous to do cardio every day.  good luck have patience and be healthy
VQs0adT8aa	It could be because he was hitting your cervix.    However, it could also be an ovarian cyst.  Not to alarm you, but many women have no other symptom of cysts except for pain/cramping during or after sex.  Some kinds of cysts can grow and endanger the ovary if not caught early enough, causing the ovary to need to be removed.      Go get a pelvic exam to be sure.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	no u shouldnt be worried it was probably putting alot of pressure on ut insides... nothing to be worried about|`|CS3W706xaa	no if you drank water be for having sex than no because having sex is a little bit of a work out so you probably were getting cramps from drinking to much or had a drink of any sort|`|bm1rsts7aa	No he was probably just hitting your cervix which is connected to your uterus.|`|GaYLCY1Waa	i wouldnt be worried about getting pregnant. maybe the sex was just too rough for your body! ive been sore many times after sex. maybe he just hit a spot in you too hard.. if your still sore then see a doctor! it couldnt hurt!|`|BhYDTUrWaa	no you are ok that happened to me before and my stomach was hurting so bad i couldn't stop shacking my leg and i also has to cramps i was on the floor in pain|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	That means the condom broke and you contracted AIDS!|`|4RpUP4teaa	This could have happened as a result of an orgasm. An orgasm is not only a feeling, but it often causes the vagina and uterus to rhythically contract. The uterus also contracts during menstruation to rid of the endometrium. So basically, orgasms cause your uterus to contract which can be a bit painful just like usual menstrual cramps. You probably don't have anything to worry about.

I work at one and there is another one very near by.  One is very nice with wellness, center, 2 pools, gym with all kinds of equipment and a full schedule of fitness classes like Spinning, Pilates and Yoga.  The other YMCA has only one or two classes, a small pool and small weight room.  One is family oriented and has kids around all the time, the other caters more to working adults only.  All depends.    Go visit it. They will give you a tour for free, maybe even a day pass to try it out.|`|Of4fg507aa	Yes|`|mbwjrAZtaa	The YMCA is absolutely a good place to workout.

QRnVLT6laa	What you need to do immediately is if you haven't already, tell your parents (no matter how much trouble you'll think you'll get in because it's worth it) all of this, and make sure that they IMMEDIATELY seek professional help. If you really are throwing up like you say you are at the end of your question, then you could be developing a serious eating disorder called "Bulimia," an eating disorder where the victim compulsively throws up every meal after they eat it. I think you should either go to a rehab clinic or a nutritionist or someone for help with your weight loss; I've known a lot of people who've tried to cope with an eating disorder on their own and it did not come out good. Professionals will know how to take care of you and will do it in a safe, monitored environment. And remember, you don't have to look like the people on T.V. to be beautiful. As long as you are confident, clean, and nice, that's where the real beauty lies.|`|0PpQxZ62aa	Don't throw up your food, it is so bad for you.      It takes -3500 calories to loose a pound, which means you need to both burn calories by working out & take less calories in by eating in order to loose weight.    Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help!

Also, when you are overweight, your body WANTS you to take it off. When you are just trying to shed vanity pounds your body isnt as helpful =)|`|0WxoAdOxaa	Yes, it is harder for thinner people to lose the weight compared to someone who is bigger.
c3f0c2ff42137562e3110961086554beaa	The best thing you can do is to do alot of exercise. Just go walking everyday for 30 minutes, and build up to jogging/running. Try different activities and get friends to join you if you can. Exercise will surpress your appetite and it releases happy hormones so you feel great afterwards. Even though it's hard while you are doing it, it really is worth it. As for the eating, encourage your family to cook healthier meals, and if they won't listen and it's not possible to cook your own meals, then just eat smaller portions of what they have and drink lots of water. You don't need to starve yourself to lose weight. The key really is exercise. It will take your mind off of food.|`|57Avg06Waa	Drink water or tea instead! They'll fill you up, girl. |`|e2H0qLH8aa	One thing to do is fill up on water. It's extremely good for you in every way!    Another thing to do is chew your food! Literally, take more time to eat your food. The organ in our bodies that controls whether we're hungry or not is not the stomache, but the brain! One commonality with over-eating is people tend to eat so fast that their brains haven't registered with the stomache yet that it's full. Eat at a slower pace, and you will fill up without eating as much.

Just keep telling yourself you arnt fat, you are perfect weight. actually, you are underweight. that isnt a bad weight. you just need to learn that even if u were fat, it doesent mean a thing. weight doesent show who you are.    just tell your boyfriend this. and go threw it together. its the best thing to do|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Sweetheart, I know how you feel.  Don't get discouraged, you aren't fat.  You should tell a parent or friend who can get you help.  Believe me, I went through this and you don't want it to go untreated for any longer.  Once you get treatment, your life will get so much better I promise.  That nagging voice in your head that tells you that you're fat can be overcome.

It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and ascertain whether you are really overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the sole method which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce results!

lY82TsNBaa	Dont stop eating. You just have to eat less. Make sure you eat lots of fruits and vegetables and drink alot of water. You should also try running and weight lifting a few times a week too|`|n33kEwIGaa	It has been stated that the average person carries 30-40lbs of undigested food stuck in their intestinal tract. Any and all unknown toxins are stored in fat cells in case the time comes when the body needs them. Of course the body does not need them, but the body is working hard to keep you healthy. Detoxifying the body is one of the best things you can do to assist the body in optimizing the elimination process so greatly needed on a daily basis. The most amazing part is that it is as easy as drinking great tasting, silky smooth, high alkaline, ionized water.
AA11626328	Yes you can.    Cut out junk foods,   stop drinking sodas, and sugars.    Workout Inside:  Bends, stretches, sit-ups,   movement: Dance,  put on some music and Dance.    You'll be surprised !!!|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	It's humanly impossible unless you starve yourself which is an insanly stupid thing to do.  You can however lose about 15 pounds in two months if you cut back on calories and exercise.    Find your BMR online, then shave 500 calories from that unless that makes it less than 1200 a day.  In that case, eat 1200 a day.  Then, do cardio at least 20 minutes a day 5-6 days a week.  Also strength train but train a different muscle group every day.  This way, you'll gain muscle and that muscle will higher your metabolic rate so you'll burn more calories at rest.    Hope I was helpful.|`|i47Y0tpGaa	its called the master cleanse you do it for 10 days and you lose weight look it up its kind of cool
e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	It is normal as long as it does not have a foul odor. You should tell your mom to check it out.

Its okay to say period LOL    Anyways, its just normal discharge. You can wear a panty liner if you like
NyTkZJQ0aa	No.  Fat and muscle are two different substances.  If you workout, you will burn fat and gain muscle, and the muscle will in turn burn even more fat while you are at est.  So you will have less fat and more muscle, but it won't turn your fat into muscle per say.|`|Vpa3cmVyaa	20 lbs over weight? If that's true then yeah. But anyway, fat will turn to muscle if you weight gain. But not lie 30 mins in the gym. 1 and a half to 3 hour work outs as much as possible. BANG OUT weights dont move them around lol.
3f6656b4b1c9055aeefeb6b07165a17daa	Taking loestrin 24 will protect you from pregnancy if taken correctly, and/or can also be used as a hormone replacement to shrink the size of ovarian cysts.  Take as prescribed, but if you are taking 1 active pill daily, you will also be protected.
	As long as your periods are usually within 21-35 days of each other, they're considered regular. Some people have all their periods on a 35 day cycle (I do).   Missing periods for a couple of months does not mean you're necessarily in danger. The first few years after women begin to menstruate can be very irregular. If your continue to skip months in a row (three or more) you should probably see either your primary care physician, a gynecologist, or both. Keep in mind that stress, diet, and excessive exercise can also cause skipped periods. There's a possibility you could have something like a hormonal disorder, an infection, or another unusual condition but considering your age, I don't think you should worry excessively about it.   If you're still concerned, try talking to your primary care doctor about it and get their opinion.|`|	nothing,many girls don't get regular until their second year of having their period.Some people have had it for longer and are still not completely regular.The only thing that guarantees you stay regular is being on birth control.

NyTkZJQ0aa	It depends on how much you weigh now and how much you eat now.  But you could probably lose like 25-40 pounds if you're strict.  But the situps won't really help all that much, if you're going to exercise, really EXERCISE.  Believe me, situps are next to ineffective if it's all you do.|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Depends on weight, age, height, metabolism, fat/muscle ratio, and many other factors. But with none of that information i am going to get as close to an accurate guess as i can, and say between 12 - 27 pounds.    Good luck. :)|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	4 lbs.|`|34tNnzQ7aa	Depends on your actual diet because 100 sit ups will take maybe two minutes... That's two minutes of exercise...
Jd1bHebRaa	Im afraid I don't REALLY know, the only one who can is the doctor. Trust me, waiting a week will be just fine. Also, dont put your hands under water,and use lotion everyday. It should be fine.

Wear perfume, tht day too....|`|3YJRqFGJaa	maybe u should ask ur doctor|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Try using scented tampons.  Go to the doctors though, because this might be a serious problem.  All periods have an "odor" that can't really be covered up.  Believe me, it bothers you more than it bothers anyone else.  If you are very worried about what other people will think, just wear some heavy perfume or body mist.  It should cover it up to were even you can't smell it anymore.|`|DH4o26rIaa	Most women feel self conscious when they are on their period. It bothers you more than anyone else and most other people can't smell it. If it really bothers you, try asking someone you trust if they can smell it too. If they can and it still bothers you, go to your doctor and see if they can recommend something.  As for the color, that doesn't matter. Periods come in a variety of colors, so don't worry.|`|2Nznp6BSaa	You may have an infection. Go to your doctor and have him/her check you out. Btw, do you use scented tampons or pads?

uUCH3hJRaa	Could be.  How often are you working them?  Some people train them everyday with high intensity.  You want to rest them like any other muscle group so they can recuperate.  I would suggest cutting back on how often and or the intensity of your workout for a bit and see how you feel.|`|wOsxpIjYaa	It sounds like so. After you are done working out try taking a warm shower and laying down. You could hurt yourself if you work your muscles to much.|`|OItPJZjBaa	I would have to say yes and no.  I am working my abs as well and I go through the exact same thing.  I figured to just tone down a little bit that way I don't injure myself.  If you are just starting out, start off slowly. Over time then increase the amount that you do.  The reason why our abs are sore for a day or two is because we are waking up those muscles.  But you do have to be careful not to injure yourself, because next thing you know you can't workout at all.  I hope this helps :)|`|OrneIpcPaa	It is sore because you are making your muscles bigger and to do that they rip open and heal back up but bigger when it hurts is the part were they are torn open it takes about a day ir two for them to heal but I recommend you don't do any exercise with them while they are sore could cause serious muscle problems

dfUSLWY4aa	It really depends on what you want to learn more about.  Both topics are extremely interesting and you will find more information than you probably will need to write.  I personally would choose PCOS...my daughter has it...and you will be surprised how many woman go un diagnosed...you will be able to spot them...but don't play doctor!  Funny thing is I am also a  of a brain injury...although the subject is interesting.  It will be to broad and the PCOS is a current topic.  Hope this helps. Lucky Lady:)|`|vOFdHvlvaa	The PCOS sounds more interestin just cuz most peeps don't know alotta about it, i think more peeps know about brain injuries than they do the PCOS, i know i do, lol, so i'd def. go with the one that would prolly be more interestin.

meLGAZLcaa	Weak knees are very common, like lots of joints.  Cod Liver Oil can help strengthen your knees and make them more flexible.    I would recommend seeing your doctor so he can take a quick look at them.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Sounds like your tendons, this could be due to over exercising, running or doing something which you dont normally do.  Knees are fragile and you would be surprised the number of people that suffer this way. If this keeps on I would go to the docs you may need a course of anti inflammatory tabs but for the meantime take Ibuprofen or even aspirin as they have an anti inflammatory action.  Good luck but dont let it go on too long it could cause long term problems if not sorted.|`|Ac0jF74vaa	i dont know what it could be, but for the last couple months ive been having problems with my left knee..it also hurts when i straighten it like you said..i used 2 have a lump on it but now its gone. I really wanna know whats wrong with it. Sorry i dont know whats wrong with your knee, but i hope it gets better :)
jn34aSgHaa	if anything say that they are for a friends baby and act like if you are on the phone with them so that the lady wont even talk to you.|`|LdlTNSSeaa	Just tell them that they are for your little sister or cousin or something like that. And by the way you will not look weird by having diapers in your hand, alot of people have little brothers and sisters.

mBUfy9zMaa	I was diagnosed by my therapist with depression and anxiety, I found her from this site, www.psychologytoday.com you just type in your zip code and it shows you all the counselors in that area.  It also shows you what each and every counselors strengths and weaknesses are when it comes to working with kids who have certain disorders.  Hope I helped, good luck sweetie!!|`|MpVQE8tnaa	If you need medications for these issues you'll need  a psychiatrist|`|gkqmrIAGaa	You first want to see a psychiatrist and get a correct diagnosis and the right and safe medications to help you. Then you want to see a therapist that your psychiatrist can refer you to. These are very hard problems for you to deal with. You should be proud of yourself for making a step towards wellness and I wish you the best.  I speak from years of experience with all three and success with medication and therapy.
5Qo6OWNzaa	I believe thats a lot of sugar based carbs.. if your not having weight issues then I guess its a moot point. If you are, that might be part of the problem|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	i hope not. I LOVE fruit. Since the sugar is natural, I dont think its bad.    The more fruit, the better right!?|`|d6IVA6mRaa	It is a lot of sugar, but it's also a lot of NUTRIENTS, plus they are filled with water and they don't have a lot of calories in them.|`|YgzpSbxdaa	It is if you are a Diabetic. Diabetics should only have 2-3 serves of fruit strictly per day. Unless of course their doctor tells them otherwise. Otherwise their blood sugar level ends up too high.    It is alot of sugar, but it's good sugar. Are you putting on weight because of it?

Rinse your head with warm water and take some puritan or antihistamine for allergies (ask at a chemist - do this now if this has only just happened in case it gets worse)  See a doctor about it if it persists.|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	Happens to a lot of people so it's not to weird.   Try to make sure you wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and focus on scrubing your scalp. A lot of people don't realize that they should focus on the scalp instead of the hair when they wash it. Then take the conditioner after you rinse out the shampoo and use that focusing on the hair itself.  If these are pimple then as you continue to do this they will go away as would any zit you keep clean. If they are ingrown hairs you might need to pop the hair out of the pimple to make it go away.  Just remember to focus on scrubbing your scalp when you wash.|`|zsg2dkPFaa	Facial cleanser will help.  I have heard of toothpaste helping...  Simply washing with soap and water could help.  That is just a reaction to sweat building up under your hair.  The sweat can attract more bacteria, and that gives you more pimples.

Crunch: Lie on floor, bend knees, put arms on chest/hands on shoulders, try to get up, without moving ur legs, move ur upper body 2 legs................dat bout it!!    Example of ur body: [o^-] ,ur body should like this when ur lying on the ground!|`|9vBuOZXxaa	a jack knife is like a crunch. To do one you have to lay on the floor straight on your back. pick up your arms and legs high ,you can lift your body up but not by much. hold for 5 seconds then go down.             To do a crunch you have to lay on the floor with your knees bent. lift up to your knees then go down.|`|mKDSnQO5aa	With a jack knife you lay flat on your back, raise your arms and legs to form a v shape, than slowly lower. Crunches are sit ups but you only raise your head a little bit and you go much faster. happy exercising!
NDOvByeXaa	try jogging/running instead of walking/jogging.    Also, do swimmer kicks(do a google search if you don't know what they are). Those are a great work out for your abs.    Also, take a look at the rest of your diet to make sure you're getting the right ammount of daily intakes.    caloriecount.about.com is a great FREE site to keep track of calories taken in, and burned.|`|I54KyS8Laa	It sounds like you are self conscious. Yes, you might still have a few pounds of baby fat that will dissolve on it's own.   If I'm right about your self consciousness, I'd suggest reading Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz as a start.   Exercise is important regardless and you may as well use exercises focused for your midsection such as crunches. A good exercise it to place a ball behind your back as you do sit-ups and when you go back to the floor on the ball it gives you extra flexing.
UDKLeWd2aa	umm dude lets see it will take you some time to have a good body man , a lot of factors come in when it comes to body building i mean you genetics, you body shape, your diet, and well the workout, if you are so into making a good body try the p90x from what i have heard p90x will turn you into superman dude it works too if you cannot do that then your workout plan seems good to me keep working out buddy and good luck|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I think it's good.    But eating four eggs everyday is bad. It causes very high cholesterol. Eat LEAN meats. Cut down on the soda. DRINK WATER EVERYDAY!|`|7pkxOc6Raa	Running is not a leg workout. Squatting is. Leg pressing is. Running is not.    You aren't working your back.    You do three bicep exercises and one tricep exercise, though triceps are 2/3 of your arm.    Routine looks bad, get on one that someone more experienced than you has made.|`|axkgR1wjaa	Dude, from the looks of it, you're kinda like a fresh canvas, metaphorically speaking you have the ideal body to mold however you see fit, i think personally, you should add a little more compound exercises that workout more than one muscle at a time, like dead lifts, and squats, these will increase your testosterone, and help you buff up, just be careful your form is correct or you could hurt yourself, also it seems like your diet consists of alot of junk food, try more lean meats, and you should definately take some protein shakes, try Muscle Milk, that stuff is good, and remember heavier weight, lesser repititions to get buffer, lesser weight more reps to get cut, hope it helps!

9XmJPjXvaa	If you want to lose weight fast, you should consider making an adjustment to your diet. Im not talking about just changing what you eat, but also change your eating habits. In some cases, the way you eat: the size of your meals, the time of day in which you eat certain food groups, the time between meals, and the number of meals you eat each day, can have a bigger effect on your weight than the amount of calories that you consume.    If you want to lose weight in 14 days, a possible weight loss method for you to use is Calorie Shifting.     Here are the basic principles of Calorie Shifting    1. You eat 4 reasonable sized meals each day based on a specific and personal menu.  2. These 4 meals contain all food groups (carbs, protein, fat).  3. You need to eat the meals at least 2.5 hours apart so theyre spaced out throughout the day.    The menu spreads the 4 meals throughout the day which causes a metabolic effect which maintains the rate in which your metabolism runs. This causes your body to burn calories faster than it does with other diets.  check it out here    http://www.14daysweightloss.biz/
CJvJVNbdaa	both of these medications are in the same class of drugs benzodiazapines and should not be taken at same time.  Xanax can be very addictive and should only be taken as prescribed Klonapin may be used as needed for increased anxiety between doses but be very careful!|`|vqpXBSNkaa	If I were you, I would not take them together unless you have a high threshhold for sedatives. They both will knock you out pretty good. Also, I think for more effective management of the problem it makes better since to seperate them out through out the day to manage your symptoms better.|`|S6JyEimJaa	Ask your doctor. Did they not come with directions or a writeup??    My doctor always explains how to take any medication she prescribes. And if she doesn't the pharmacist does.
9pLdhuBnaa	This could be related to the pill if she is just starting out and having the body try to adjust to the medication (an example only).    I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.

awUzUxo5aa	Open a window|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I wear warm clothes, a hat and a scarf. If you walk as often as you can, you become acclimatised to the weather as the seasons change. I remember enjoying a walk in frost of -18 oC a few years ago. I had ice in my beard and a smile on my face. It's usually much warmer though.|`|ToztjpAsaa	They don't, they drive everywhere.  (I live in the UK, by the way.)|`|AcsML4Leaa	wrap up warm :)
HA2IV3r3aa	It depends on how much weight you are using.  If you are serious about weight lifting, go get a standard olympic set.  Length isn't as important as the load bearing capacity of the bar, rack, and bench.
PnaE2bWBaa	First of all, Targeted fat reduction is kind of sketchy. Working out your arms will only make your arms more defined or more muscular depending on what type of training you do. (aerobic for defined anaerobic for muscular) so just the elliptical machine will help you loss arm fat. If you want to burn more fat you can do more exercises to help you lose it but exercising your arms will not make your arms skinnier.    Secondly, it's not a matter of how many you do it's how hard you work out and how long. if you really want to get skinnier go on a diet and exercise regularly aerobically.    Lastly just good luck to you on your quest for weight loss.|`|sdf5runGaa	2 times a week is enough

7gcdOCbtaa	Erhead,    You have to be honest with yourself above everything.If your not ,your not going to feel better inside or out.Talk to your Parents / Adult you respect ,tell them what is going on.They need to get you to see a Psychiatrist who can give meds.( if needed).YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST WHEN YOU FILL OUT THE FORMS,TO THE DR. HIM/HER .What is the point in going otherwise? Do you like feeling like this? Of course not.So do yourself a favor and your friends ,reach out and ask for it.You should be living a fun & happy, life,School & boy's are the only problem you should be trying to figure out.SO DO IT !!!!!! go now.....|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	You sound like an extremely intelligent 14 year old.  If feeling sad and depressed has been so bad that you have seen psychologists then you need help. You need to see a psychiatrist who can make a correct diagnosis and if needed the right and safe antidepressants.  Only a psychiatrist can diagnose you correctly. But it is of no use if you are going to ask for help and not tell everything. You have nothing to be ashamed of or embarrased about. They have to know every detail if you are going to be helped. There is help and it can change your life for the better if you are honest. There a number for teens that is staffed by professionals who can help you. You can talk to them anytime and they can help you decide what to do and what kind of help you may need. the numbe is 1-800-833-5948.  It may help if you open up with someone on the phone first. I wish you the best, you don't deserve to feel like this and there is help!|`|tMghXutuaa	I think you might have bi-polar, do you have a school consuler? Talk to He/Her and they might tell you. Or you just have a mood swing of depression.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Seems to me that you might just be going through teen age mood swings which are common at your age, but it could also be a little depression.    I"ve had depression a loooooong time but varying degrees of it.  All those changing hormones will throw your mood out of wack..happens to lots of teenagers.    If you really feel like you've got the blues for more than 6 months, you definitely need to do something about it in some way.  If you really wanna know, I think Jesus is the best anti-depressant.    But also good are: getting exercise every day, cut out negative thoughts, learn to stop them in your head and don't let them rewind over and over...start focusing on something positive that can make you happy.    Well, depression is a real pain in the butt...sorry I can't help more.  Try to thank God when you see something good in someone else for giving them this gift or talent.  I know he must have given you gifts, too.  What are they?  Write them down.  Ask your friends.    God Bless!
xqtS3rWAaa	Put less food on your plate and eat slowly. If you feel like you have less food on your plate, use a smaller plate so it looks like you have more food. Eating slowly will help you eat less and realize you're full faster since it takes 20 minutes for your body to know if it is full or not.    Good Luck, and remember that food is something you use to nourish yourself not a treat or drug or something you do only for fun.    Hope this helped! =)|`|rbjzHWabaa	you should eat slowly-- then within 20 minutes your body will tell you that your full- then just walk away.|`|1aybJTCBaa	dont put so much on your plate   email me and I will give you a whole bunch of tips if you want. :)  it kaybrunettee@yahoo.com|`|lY82TsNBaa	Try using a smaller plate, so when you fill it it will have less food on it

If you want one or two colors, turquoise and purple look good together, and they don't usually fade.    Your still young, have fun with them if you want. Hopefully you'll only have them once, so you might as well have some fun.     Good luck to you!!!

It seems to be an average of all types of people i.e. race, culture, etc. Keep in mind that the BMI doesn't take into account of body builders or other sports which require safely being over or under weight.|`|wpBMkIzlaa	Your BMI (body mass index) is 20. Which is normal. And it all depends for every person. It shouldn't matter if someone was slightly overweight or underweight. It's about what's inside you.

8p7ZmllVaa	this is a tough situation. but lets not to jump to any conclusions here. what you could do is have you and your friends all sit at different areas to see which person he seems to be around a lot. if you feel anyway uncomfortable and he is making remarks about your pants i would tell a trusted adult. if you cant tell your parents, you could try a friends parent, a trusted teacher, or even the principal. dont be afraid to speak up for yourself. who knows. it could all be a misunderstanding, but if you dont speak up then it will continue to happen. try talking to some one who can help you so this doesnt happen anymore|`|RwNVHqWnaa	first you need to say something to your parents. then the three of you need to sit down and talk to the principle (not the creepy one). if he won't do anything then you and your friends and parents should take it to the school board.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	Go and talk to a female staff member about this and your parents|`|chOS6EO0aa	I am unsure if you are a student or worker.

ODD7UZFuaa	ACV works pretty good, not as a diet pill but it helps break down the food you are eating so make sure to drink it with the meal. I recommend the ACV pills. you can get it at any vitamin store or local drug store. That way you don't have to deal with the taste of the ACV.
QYv6VI99aa	Apple Cider Vinegar, is so Healthy & Good for You, For so many things, Not only just to lose weight.  You should drink it everyday, NOT Straight.  Drink it with water ~ You put about 3 Tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar in a Glass of Water. Don't ever make the Apple Cider Vinegar hot because it will destroy the Natural Wonderful Ingredient.  Though if You are going to eat a Salad, You can put a 1/4 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar Sraight, in cup & Add About a 1/4 cup of Cold Pressed Olive Oil & Salt & Pepper, Mix it all Together & Eat & Enjoy!  ...  This might sound discusting, But it's a Miracle worker.  If ever You have a Yeast infection, or Burning, or Uncomfortable feelings "Down Below" You then can pour a 1/4 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar in a Basin, With the other 1/2 Water, Maybe just a touch more Water, & Get a clean Cloth & Drench the Cloth with that Solution that You just made up. & Squeeze the cloth just abit & Wash around That area ~ "Down Below" & Do Not rinse it off, Leave it on. It will sooth the dicomfort, & Soon The Discomfort will disappear.    You can use Straight on Misquito bites, It helps take away the itch.    Anyways with Your Diet ~ You will see a Good difference, When continuing to drink it. & With Prayer!  If You want to lose weight, Seriously ask GOD in Prayer, Cause GOD reads our Hearts & He Knows what we are thinking before we even say it. He wants Us to talk to him.  Read The Bible & Pray to God & Tell Him what You want ~ He will hear You.  "IT WORKS!"  GOD Answers Prayer!|`|mOZfR8yhaa	Don't eat that its gross! Try getting Wii Fit or something.

Hope I helped you!|`|am5ESJHgaa	There is no easy way to lose weight.    It takes -3500 calories to loose a pound, which means you need to both burn calories by working out & take less calories in by eating in order to loose weight.    Try to move away from fad diets. There is a slight possibility that it will help you lose weight but it will be extremely hard to keep it off    Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped drinking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help!

Do not try to feel that what you feel for both sexes discourage you from talking to your mother or any other adult you feel comfortable with.  If you can not talk about it you will feel you have to hide it.

If it bothers her to the point where she's dehydrating herself, running it by her doctor might not be a bad idea, just to make sure nothing is more seriously wrong.  Constant excessive thirst can be an early sign of diabetes, although I think with that she would just HAVE to drink constantly... but anyway, she shouldn't be dehydrating herself like that.  She could also have an "overactive bladder" where one of those meds could help.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	She could be dealing with something like a condition called urge incontinence (an example only).

AA11432707	What you need to do is find out who gave you the anesthetic, and what exactly happened.  It's also a good idea to request a copy of your anesthesia record.  You might not understand it, but any anesthesiologist who takes care of you in the future would benefit from looking at it.    Meningitis is not a complication of anesthesia, unless it was a spinal or epidural that got infected (not done for brain surgery).  Meningitis is a surgical complication.    Still, DO get that information.  If you show up in MY operating room someday, I'm going to want to know what happened so I don't repeat it!  Some people respond to anesthesia in funky ways.  If you're one of them, we want to know.  It's also possible that somebody just screwed up.  It happens.    Hope your meningitis resolves, and that all goes well with you.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	No, meningitis can not be caused by anesthesia. Meningitis can be caused by either a virus, or a bacteria. Hospitals are ces pits of infection, and you probably picked it up there.

RXI8ImdIaa	A root canal is the treatment for a deep cavity that has reached the nerve area of the tooth. If you had that sort of cavity you would know - it would HURT!    from your description I have no idea what the problem is with your teeth, if there is one in the first place.|`|3vBALAlaaa	Go to a dentist, and I've heard it hurts like heck! Good luck!|`|5e1843a800af8a0c4fa0753cee310ddbaa	call you dentist and he should be able to tell you.|`|tSwfHhT3aa	You wont need a root canal, the tooth would hurt very much if you needed one.   The root canal would be to get rid of the infection in the tooth, but you would certainly know if you had one because it would hurt!
uKXgg9heaa	Saline Drops can decongest your stuff nose.|`|xVMtfuWPaa	hot mint tea with honey and lemon.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Drink some hot tea with a little honey in it to help with your throat, sip it slowly. For your nose take a hot bath or shower and relax. The steam from the bath will help clear out your nose. I hope you get to feeling better!|`|qK2B6Ivaaa	I would reccomend taking a long hot shower.  The steam in the shower should help your nose run.    It always does for me. :)    And whenever you CAN go to the drugstore, go there and buy some Vicks shower tabs. They're little bluish green discs you can get and place at the bottom of the shower drain, and they're amazing. If you've ever tried Vicks VapoRub then it essentially does the same thing.  But the shower tabs, (which dissolve in the water by the time your shower's over) are great when combined with the steam. :)
AA11895447	Ok, you didn't hurt yourself, the bleeding is normal. Some girls bleed a lot, others a little, still others not at all. It will go away in a few days and you'll feel back to normal again.    About the birth control option - you need to talk to your sister or mother about it. Tell her that you know that there has been some family history surrounding sexual activity, and you want to be responsible and mature about it, so since you have recently been sexually active for the first time, you want to go on birth control. Just be honest with her, don't hide anything, and tell her you want to do the responsible thing. sex is a natural part of life, and as long as you are being an adult, mature, and responsible about it, there's nothing wrong with it.    If you are over 16, you don't need your parent's permission to go on the pill. However, I still think you should talk to your mother or sister or another trusted female adult. Your mom will not be offended if you come to her and are honest with her, however, she will be offended if you hide the truth from her. She won't trust you, because people who have nothing to hide, hide nothing. Talk to her, you are being an adult about sex and doing the responsible thing, good for you!    Good luck, I'm sure things will go just fine.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	Go ahead and tell your sister, she'll understand! and if you're not ready to tell your parents your sister can help you get on birthcontrol privately without them knowing so you won't risk getting pregnant its safe but make sure the boy still wears a condom!    and its totally normal for girls to bleed on the first time that just means your cherry popped|`|t4BpFdmdaa	no that is spose to happen...when u have it..  i think,|`|3YJRqFGJaa	u should just go to her and tell her. also its normal ur cherry popped it may bleed some more|`|JhGEokVsaa	thats normal, don't worry. it usually only happens the first time though, !
UCq4Ap5Eaa	i had the same problem with my knees! after a while i could barely walk ahah..  try the elliptical, its alot easier on the legs.  switch on and off with that and swimming. dont forget light weight training..trust me it will tone your body and you will look alot better.  change your lifestyle a little bit, nothing dramatic, because no one wants to dread exercise/their diet. once a week eat something you love, but dont overindulge on it. if you completely cut things like that out, you will just end up craving it. diets dont work for me..because then i'm always worrying if im messing it up or not. i just eat as healthy as i can. have no more than 1200-1500 calories a day.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	If exercise is not your thing, then you should go on a good diet plan called calorie shifting.    Calorie Shifting will help you to lose weight fast, from less than 14 days.  In Calorie Shifting you will be making adjustments to your diet.  Its just not only about changing what you eat, but also changing your eating habits, the way you eat, the size of your meals, the time of day in which you eat certain food groups, the time between meals, and the number of meals you eat each day.  All this can have a bigger effect on your weight than the amount of calories that you consume.    The researchers have discovered that the human body takes several days to "sense" any change in calories, so if you SHIFT your calories (in a VERY special way and eating pattern) then your body gets "confused" and begins burning extra fat .    Here are the basic principles of Calorie Shifting :-    1. You eat 4 reasonable sized meals each day based on a specific and personal menu.  2. These 4 meals contain all food groups (carbs, protein, fat).  3. You need to eat the meals at least 2.5 hours apart so theyre spaced out throughout the day.    In Calorie Shifting, the menu spreads the 4 meals throughout the day which causes a metabolic effect which maintains the rate in which your metabolism runs. This causes your body to burn calories faster than it does with other diets and causes your body to lose weigh faster.  If you follow the menu exactly you will be losing 9lbs in just eleven days.

NyTkZJQ0aa	Probably 10-15 pounds or so depending on your weight, but you'll be in starvation mode and gain it all back when you eat normally again.  Add more food, count calories, try to eat 1200 a day and exercise.  Believe me, if you do that, you'll lose at a pretty fast pace but you'll actually KEEP it off.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	2 lbs.|`|43A0U8l2aa	depends on the person and how much you weigh..maybe around 5 lbs    but that is really unhealthy bc you are not getting enough nutrients your body needs!!!! you need more fruit, protein, dairy, and vegtables in your diet!!!!     try eating more but also exercising|`|JHfxwDsqaa	depends on how much of that stuff u eat. u still need vitamins, so pay attention to that.

fvuEtkROaa	I believe your question relates to the size of the breast and cancer.  Breast size does not make any difference in the prevelance of breast cancer.  Density of breast tissue decreases with age in women making the usual screening tests such as mammograms more easily read by the radiologist.  Breast cancer in younger women (pre-menopausal) is more aggressive and therefore more often fatal, but that does not have anything to do with the density or the mass of breast tissue.  Men, too, can get breast cancer and comprise about 1% of breast cancer patients.  For further information, check the American Cancer Society web site.
fRjaIyL6aa	Breast cancer is staged using the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging method.    T staging ranges from 1-4  T1 = 5cm, T4 = skin/chest wall involvement, peau d'orange, inflammatory cancer    N ranges from 1-3  N1 = ipsilateral axillary nodes, N2 = fixed ipsilateral axillary nodes, N3 = ipsilateral internal mammary nodes    M ranges from 0-1  M0 = no metastasis, M1=distant metastasis    Staging is then made as such:  Stage I = T1, N0, M0  Stage IIa = T0-1, N1, M0 OR T2,N0,M0  Stage IIb = T2, N1, M0 OR T3, N0, M0  Stage IIIa = T0-3, N2, M0 OR T3,N1-2, M0  Stage IV = M1    Estimated survival at 5 years out from diagnosis:  - Stage 0 - 100%    - Stage I - 100%    - Stage IIA - 92%    - Stage IIB - 81%    - Stage IIIA - 67%    - Stage IIIB - 54%    - Stage IV - 20%    WIth a 5cm tumor your T stage is T2 bordeline T3.  Your nodal stage is 0.  Your metastasis staging is presumed to be M0.    This all depends on how you were diagnosed since you state you have no spread to lymph nodes.  This suggests that you have already undergone treatment of some kind.  Lymph node status is usually diagnosed by biopsy either by sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection.  If not, then likely you were clinically examined for lymph nodes and none were found.  In this case there is a 25% chance you have a pathologically negative lymph node based on your primary tumor size.    Doing chemotherapy prior to surgery, known as neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been shown to improve overall survival.  What it does do is improve your chance of having breast conservative surgery after the chemotherapy is completed.  Thus I would presume your doctor is planning on having you undergo surgery once the chemotherapy is completed.    The chance of it spreading and recurring depends on the rest of your treatment.  As long as you have surgery you can be treated for cure.  There will still be a chance of recurrence.  There are many studies that have calculated recurrence rates after therapy.  Risk of recurrence or new tumors after treatment is 1% per year.    So you have either Stage IIa or Stage IIb breast cancer.  You will need your primary tumor removed and a sentinel lymph node biopsy done during that procedure. You can potentially have breast conservative surgery consisting of wide local excision of the tumor.  You have somewhere between 81-92% survival chance at 5 years out.  After treatment, you will have a 1% per year risk of it recurring.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	A 5 cm tumor is pretty substantial. That you don't have any positive lymph nodes, though, is good news. Yes, you will have surgery, but sometimes people have chemo before surgery, while others have surgery before chemo.     The size of the lump, itself, is not a good way to tell if it's going to spread. The fact that you have no positive nodes, that you are receiving chemo, and that you will have surgery to remove the lump will all help you to achieve very positive outcomes.    Good luck and God bless. Stay strong!|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	not compared to some, my mum`s whole breast was cancerous, mine was 8cm, some are a lot smaller they`re all scary, it`s not the size that really counts its the type and if it responds to treatment, every ones chemo is different too and radio, and if you want it removed ask for it,only your doc knows whys and wherefores, don`t be scared to ask, the breast care nurses are usually great and spend more time explaining things, good luck

It takes -3500 calories to loose a pound, which means you need to both burn calories by working out & take less calories in by eating in order to loose weight.    Eat fruits & veggies of course.

I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories.

FVs2GRxGaa	You need to add a lot more fruit and veggies in your diet! And I would personally drop the sandwiches as I've noticed in my own body that cutting the carbs even in 1/2 made a huge difference. Maybe try something like turkey WRAPS which is a bit better!  I would also up the jogging unless you're doing that 7 days a week.. you're gonna need to sweat a lot more to lose those 30 lbs. No eating after 8 is good and celery is a good thing to eat because it has no calories (just use a LITTLE peanut butter, no dressing) If you eat salads don't use cream based dressings, go for the oil based like vinegarettes. I also noticed that eating small snacks throughout the day helps curb me from sitting and eating everything I see because I'm so hungry. I personally recommend the Turbo Jam 20 minute workout as I've been doing for awhile and really enjoy it..   good luck!
sdf5runGaa	ok boobies first of all is keep with the fat loss and concentrate on your upper pecks (incline bench press) this will pull the boobies upwards,     so how do u lose fat?    well there are a thousand fad diets out there, but im a believer in clean healthy food in the right amounts at the right time,    so firstly things to avoid while on fat loss,    drugs lol  alcohol  junk food  chicken skin etc  deep fried foods      now u can eat some of the following but i reccomend you try to cut out carbohydrates after like 3pm in the afternoon and ur fat loss will increase, instead eat high protien throughout the day and especially at night, try to avoid too much of the following    white breads  pastas  rice  potatoes    try to eat chiken steak of fish steaks with salads or protien shakes etc at night,    eat 6 small meals through out the day,    and make sure u know how many calories u need to eat to loose weight,    this is done by finding the amount of caloires your body need to maintain its current weight and taking around 300 caliroes of that amount. you can see bodybuilding.com for a calculator and more info.    mix this all with high intensity cadio training (meanin doing say the treadmill of 2 mins normal pace then 1 min flat out top speed, and the repeating the cycle around 10 times) at least 4 times a week more if u like.    and some weight training, with a swiss ball work for your abs and leg raises,      now for a pregno lookin belly, many people have this even skinny guys, the problem is stress levels and bloating caused by carbs, so cut out carbs at night and when u train stik with high - low intensity training like i said,

Hope you have a good recovery!|`|BhFeii5Xaa	I think that depends on your podiatrist or surgeon who put the casting on it.     Ask the doctor when and if you can return to sports endeavors.     You don't want to be crippled for the rest of your life! So don't rush back into your sport too soon.
AA10378447	No idea. Call the pharmacy that filled your prescription and ask. Don't use soaps, especially if you're sensitive. Even if you're not, many of them cause yeast infections at the least. Use something like Summer's Eve instead.
HA2IV3r3aa	You can spend your entire life in a Sauna and you will not lose a single calorie because of it.  Saunas only make you sweat, and sweat is comprised of water and salts.  No calories.    I think people make the mistake of believing that a sauna will lead to weight loss because when you work out you end up sweating a lot.  But it isn't the sweating that is causing you to lose weight.  Sweating is only a mechanism to regulate body temperature  If anything, staying out of the sauna will burn more calories.  If you are cold your body has to burn energy to keep you warm.  If you're already warm you'll just get rid of some water weight.

bAxAhQr9aa	I would talk to a doctor about this.  Or just browse some websites about being pregnant? This is probably just a few side affects, maybe post this question in the pregnancy section and see if anyone has similar things going on. Sorry I am not much help.  *Best Answer*|`|RSm8aXgzaa	Apparently that's normal.  Don't worry about it.  I don't know what causes it but you could look it up on google or wiki or something.

It doesn't kill you internally, but it can ruin your life. It WILL ruin your life, so dont smoke
UpPWXRK4aa	Yes probably barely 50 calories. I have this soup that is just broth and vegetables and some black beans, and a serving is 60 calories. And that is from a can so has more sodium and crap in it, plus the beans, so you are probably near 40-50 cals.|`|f84a503830fa54387d6c79c677ba67a3aa	It might have a few caloried to start with but with those vegies you will burn more calories than you will take in.  It is called a negative calorie food.    Seriously, there is a soup recipe called "Peel-Pound Soup" and you can lose a pound a day eating it because all of those ingredients burn more calories to digest than they contain. These are good to lose weight fat but are nto good for you if you follw the diet for more than  week at a time    Google the "Peel-a-Pound Diet" and you will see what I mean.
js2NiTYIaa	Just keep doing what your doing, eventually, it will shrink.  That's normally the best way to lose it.  So just keep eating healthy, and sit-ups.

By all means tone your core abdominals but you need more aerobic activity too.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	im a personal trainer, only certified for women exercise tho. however, i find the only REAL way for women to lose lovehandles is cardio, so i would say maybe try running (ii know, its hard to do in the cold winter!)    your technique is actually a great target exercise; still, you are defining muscles UNDER fat. it will look better, because of definition, but to get rid of the fat, you need aerobic exercise/diet|`|W6gKHMemaa	Eat Fewer Pies !!!|`|AA12048771	are you male or female and what do you eat on a daily basis ? cardio is the key to loosing weight lifting weights will add and help sure but cardio is where you burn the most calories.

I run a lot for exercise and do crunches and push ups and i'm really happy with my sucess so far. I'm going to keep going until i reach my goal  So take it into consideration.

Although you can leave them in for longer, four hours is my cutoff time for having a tampon in. I use 4-5 a day, depending on how heavy my flow is. It's probably better for you to change your tampon more than you need to rather than less.|`|m7I5QnE1aa	Uh yes.  If you're saturating the tampons in that amount of time and still having to wear a pad for protection, get a super absorbency one!|`|MW5EJxKNaa	Yes, clearly your flow is very heavy.

Everyone is different but this is normal.    2. jackinworld.com has a lot of info on techniques and also questions like yours.    3. I never tried this on ps3, but tubehentai.com is a good site.

cK6krJGoaa	SPH is the sphere, or the amount of magnification/demagnification your eye needs to see properly. If you have a positive number, the lens will help with closer images, and a negative number will help with distance images.    CYL is the cylinder. What that is is a section of the lens that is a different strength that the main prescription. What usually happens is your eye is not round; it's more football-shaped which distorts the way the light enters your eye, causing difficulty seeing. The cylinder will lay in the opposite direction of how your eye leans, helping focus the light back how it's supposed to enter your eye.    AXIS is the degree line, from 0 to 180, that the cylinder should be oriented.    Not all eyes have astigmatism so not all will have a CYL & AXIS. Some may just have a SPH.|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	SPH means sphere, cylander means, axis, its' the power in your glasses or contacts, -sphere is near sighted + sphere is farsided, the axis is the measure of the tilt of your cornea|`|PIcomI6Oaa	sph means the myopia. cyl means the astim. and axis is the curvey of the eyes. axis will come with the astim|`|f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	If you see a prescription that is for example    OD (right eye) -1.00 sph That means minus one sphere meaning there is no astigmatism in the eye  OS (left eye) -1.00 -.75 x095 That means that the sphere is minus one and there is minus point 75 at 095 astigmatism found.     CYL means Cylinder     From the AOA: Astigmatism is a vision condition that causes blurred vision due either to the irregular shape of the cornea, the clear front cover of the eye, or sometimes the curvature of the lens inside the eye. An irregular shaped cornea or lens prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, the light sensitive surface at the back of the eye. As a result, vision becomes blurred at any distance.

f0vdBz2iaa	The most logical reason for the sudden surge of hunger is the increase of demand on your body now that you've begun exercising.  And it doesn't help that at your age (particularly if you're a boy), your body is going through rapid growth.      I recommend going about your exercising and dieting the right way from the beginning.  If you are only drinking water, and are suddenly exerting your body more than it is used to, you are dooming yourself to failure.  That is completely unsustainable.  Check out this site: http://www.dietitian.com/calcbody.php|`|ZRk9ptfoaa	Sounds like you have been eating too many carbs and need to eat more fiber and fluids.

NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.    Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.    First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.    However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at theweig htlossplace.com along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.    Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|AA12149303	Should be, it has been approved by the FDA.
uXP1Xij4aa	If you have high metabolism, the solution is that you eat more, when you consume more calories then you burn during the day, then your body will start to store it as fat.    How your body will store fat on you, how much oif it will got o your breast and how much in the middle, depends if you exercise regularly or not.  If you not physically active, most fat will be stored in the middle of your body, tights, butt, stomach.   But if you exercise do cardio regularly, the body learns to store fat differently and distributes it more evenly on the body, not just in the middle, so this way more fat tissue can be stored on your upper body and make your breasts larger, without looking like you are fat.    So basically, with your high metabolism you need to eat more to gain weight and you need to exercise too, cardio 30 minutes per day, this will help spread the gained weight more evenly on your body, and could help put more fat tissue on your breast. Eat a lot of chicken, it has healthy protein and good fat, and that's what you need.
kVybkdOsaa	You are right!  Your hormones are all messed up.    To get a full understanding of what your body is going through and what you can do about it you should read the book: "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause".  Written by Dr. John R. Lee with Virginia Hopkins.    This book explains your hormones better than any textbook I have ever read in College.

Couldn't lose any weight until I came off it.|`|60mDEusiaa	HI, yep, I know how you feel. I'm 22, 5'8 and 171lbs.     Before depo I was 147lbs(I had lost close to 80lbs down from 225lbs!).     I'm tired all the time, I can sleep 12 hrs, I have an appetite all the time(and it's so much easier to give into it, than attempt to fight it). I've gotten dizzy from it 3 times.     0 sex drive, right here. Now that it's time for my next shot, I have been able to tell a difference these last two days. I'm wanting it more.     My hair has been greasier and my skin breaks out in the month, that I am due for my shot.    Most of my weight seems to be around the waist. I know I've helped out the weight gain though, alcohol, sweets, junk food, BUT I always have an appetite.     I use to not have such a bad appetite, seriously. As soon as my first shot, WHAM.appetite, instant gain of 5lbs.    I've been on it since August of 2007.    I hate the tiredness, appetite, and depression from it.    Also, my joints crack more... :(    I'm going to switch to the pill. The depo shot is the only birth control I've had.I'd like to see about the Paragard IUD though, no hormones. I just don't understand the "good" in putting a bunch of hormones into the body... I'd be thrilled to lose 25lbs.    If it wasn't for the appetite and tiredness, then I would stay on it and try to deal with the depression, but it's getting to be too much.      EDIT: Also very dry down there...no fun. :(|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.

5LJUiqOUaa	an ortho. usually knows if you need braces or not just by looking at your teeth . if s/he decides you need braces, they will take x-ray, take pictures of your teeth, and make an imprint of your teeth . the ortho. might look at your teeth the 1st day and do x-rays and everything on another visit . then, there is a visit with your parents to discuss the cost of your braces . on the next visit, the ortho. will put spacers between your teeth ( if you need them ) to make room for braces . the ortho. usually keeps the spacers in for a week and you go back to the ortho. to get braces on . so it's about 3-4 visits before you get braces .|`|0lCnu1g2aa	they will look at your smile, take x rays and maybe molding of your teeth (unpleasant but necessary). They will also discuss your options with you and your parents
pzLDXL6gaa	It's possible. Yes just wait to see if she gets her period, if it's late or abnormally light then take another test    Harriet|`|LMRaSXFeaa	just wait like two more weeks and have her take another one.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Ovulation usually occurs around the middle of her cycle, or 14 days before her period is due to come again.  However, women do sometimes ovulate at odd times of the month.  Wait until she is a week late, take a good quality home pregnancy test, do it first thing in the morning, as there are more hormones present in the first urine of the day, and you will know five minutes later.    good luck..|`|Fn4kxmLEaa	Well if you took a first response it would be pretty acurate. Since you had sex 1 day after her period I would say it's not likely. A woman doesn't usually ovulate until about 2 weeks after her period. Good luck!
S3XT8UtYaa	this is so freaky.  I just took my son to the doctor for the SAME THING.  Three weeks and he's been sick nearly every day.  This is not to be taken as doctors advice but I will ask the same thing he asked us.  Have you been out of the country and eaten the food? (bacterial or parasitic infection) Are you abnormally stressed?  (irritalble bowel syndrome)  Because of my son's age ,16, it's most likely a case of lactose intolerance.  He's going to keep a food diary for two weeks with NO milk products to see if the symptoms stop or continue.   If they continue, then we are going to look at blood work and stool samples.  My son is not cool with that part but he's tired of puking his guts out at school and having the drizzles nearly every day.  Headaches can be caused by dehydration.  Drink water, even if you don't think you can keep it down.|`|DQMMCmY6aa	u could be pregnant!|`|amb3ouXjaa	You could be pregnant, you can be pregnant and have your period at the same time.  It has happened to a lot of people.  When my sister was pregnant she dropped some weight and then gained it back. Take a test, or go to the doctor.  Then again it could just be a stomach virus.  Good luck!|`|zx8cVDqIaa	You might have a Stomach Virus, you must've eaten from a resteruant and the chef coughed or sneezed in the food.
qMQJx0tdaa	there is no typical day.. there can be no calls, to stupid calls, to death calls... the least i have run in a day is 0 and the most, 16...   but hey, i think it is one of the only jobs you get payed to sleep or play on the computer!!!

eO4y3m1maa	As the spammers said, it is hard to target the belly area. The reason women in the fifties had that look...it was natural, they were sucking in (seriously) or they belly danced (not purposely exercise)    Exercised wasn't thought of really to extent that it is now...in Bettie pages modeling time you were naturally like that or did ridiculous things like that belt.    You can do sit ups, cardio, and stuff to slim the belly area and watch your food portions..finish eating before you think your full..drink ALOT of water so you don't keep water weight|`|4iQwI6D7aa	thats easy hmmm if only i could explain well press both your hands together with a lot of strenght and you should be able to keep them :)

They could do   more harm than good at your age.|`|npT9UmPeaa	i take 'Redback complete protein powder' you just add it with water and it works really well it gives you alot of energy and like helps with muscle mass and working out as well|`|yLGDj86Qaa	BSN Syntha 6 and NO-Xplode has done wonders for me.|`|IDVFsy5waa	i take juice plus!  definitely the best!
MoNePl6naa	I would say doing the DVD would cause you to burn more calories. You can increase the intensity of the exercises by performing them faster, which would result in more calories burned. However, you could do the same thing with biking by either pedaling faster or increasing the resistance. The DVD sounds like you will get more of a total body workout and weight training. Increasing muscle mass will increase the amount of calories used. Lastly, riding a stationary bike can get boring, whereas the DVD could be more interesting. When the weather gets nicer, you should try walking outside...much more satisfying.|`|c6c3197c22f4d9981122190a19ed2212aa	What your doing is working the heart muscle which does lead to some weight loss but not as immediate as weight lifting.  A balance diet combined with aerobic and muscle development will be the best and quickest way for you to loose weight.  Muscle uses fat to grow, however too much weight training may also increase your weight (more muscle which weights more).  So repetition of low scale weights may be the best solution.|`|ig08e4Pdaa	Don't you really mean "fat loss"?    If you're really serious, then just keep up your exercise you outlined.     If you really want to lose fat, then try "calorie shifting". It's not just about how much you exercise, but what KIND of calories you're taking in. Not just how many.    Here's a site that has the calorie shifting program: It's the one that's called "Fat Loss 4 Idiots" and I believe there's a discount.  http://bobs-reviews.com    You can lose 9lbs every 11days...without exercise. Can you imagine how much you'd lose if you did both?!    Good luck,  Robert|`|QnGtN0oHaa	You should know about growth hormone which is anti-aging hormone .It help to build up muscles in body and to increase your metabolic rate.There are natural ways to increase the secretion of this hormone like:food rich in proteins especially arginine and lysine (in all meat and peanut),do not sleep or workup after you have your food for at least two hours because after food especially food rich in sugar ,your body will secret insulin(anti-growth hormone) and usually growth hormone is secreted in your blood in the first two hours of sleeping and during exercise.
UpPWXRK4aa	It really comes down to how often you smoke... for example if you normally smoke every day, it doesn't matter what you do for the next couple days in terms of detox because it will probably still come up positive. If you smoke like once a week or maybe random 3 times one week and none the next, you will probably be good. I remember when I had a random drug testing, I had smoked the day before (only 1 hit though)but it didn't come up positive because I hadn't smoked a lot the past month (maybe 3 times total).    If you are muscular and in shape or skinny, you will have a better chance of it getting out of your system quick, if you are overweight THC stays in fat cells longer and you can't really push that out of your body. I spent 2 days freaking out and reading up on whatever I could find, all those detox "secrets" are BS.|`|L6w8YmoOaa	better be sure and drink at LEAST a gallon everyday till then,|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	It's not really possible to get it out of your system by then, but there are ways to hide it.  My friend smoked two days before her test and passed by drinking a gallon of gelatin mix right before the test.  Look it up, it worked for her at least.
DIRbVD5uaa	Im not sure.  You can try to eat unhealthy foods like chips, doughnuts, cookies or even [[ Cupcakes ]]    You may even not gain anything at all. You could have a fast metabolsim [ spelling ].    Id suggest seeing a Doctor if its really Bothering You.

dcWN4v6Jaa	I recommend light pink and baby blue because those colors look so nice together. By the way if your orthodontist haven't explained about how they put them on and if they hurt here is some information you need to know about. It doesn't hurt by the way.       WEBSITES  1. http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...  2. http://www.bracesinfo.com/  3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...  4. http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...  5. http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...     PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5.

They will stain from food and stuff and make your teeth look yellow :(|`|8rwy2TJ4aa	umm try black or white most recent cool colors|`|i1k7B2n9aa	The hardware that goes on the molars are called "bands", they come in all different sizes so chances are they'll have a size that fits.  Valentines Day is coming up so pink, red (or both)  would look cool  and a word to the wise?  They start to hurt (a lot) about 6-12 hours after they are put on so you might want to consider taking a pain killer after they are on    Good luck!|`|93yb4QaHaa	Don't worry they have some really small brackets cuz I have tiny teeth too, but you'll be in ALOT of pain for a good week. I would recommend taking some pain relievers before going to the ortho to delay the pain, but I always get silver rubber bands because they don't make your teeth look discolored or make food stand out. Good Luck!|`|rrIgv0EOaa	Any shade of blue works well. I also like dark reds.    But no matter what, do NOT get yellow or white. They just make your teeth look yellow.    As for your small molars, orthodontists have many sizes of brackets, they will have a size to fit you. After all, they do have to have some to fit 7 year olds, and their teeth are much smaller than yours.|`|ylta3PD8aa	I'm getting my braces in a week. I've been told not to get clear or white because it stains and yellow because it makes your teeth look yellow. I would go for a dark color like a navy because it makes your teeth look whiter. Don't get rainbow because it is immature.|`|hkzGYQD4aa	No, they wouldn't cancel putting on braces. When you went to get evaluated for braces, the orthodontist would have looked at that. As for the colors, either would work. Rainbow would be cool =] Just don't get white because it starts to turn a yucky yellowish color. Good luck!|`|A2ODlbKfaa	yellow so it could match your teeth jk|`|5LJUiqOUaa	i think rainbow would look too confused lol baby blue would look nice :) light color tend to make your teeth look whiter . don't get white because after a while it makes your look yellow . don't pick red because it looks like there is blood in your mouth lol . but pink looks really good :) i don't think they will cancel your braces because the ortho. already knows what your teeth look like and they have many sizes of brackets . and sometimes if your back teeth are straight, they won't even put brackets on because i don't even have any brackets on my back teeth .|`|5UlD5mVpaa	I don't know if your orthodontist has them, but mine had glow in the dark bands.|`|rKsgGHKkaa	My friend once got neon pink and yellow braces it looked so cool!

It specifically states on the tube that it can be used for ringworm and I found it very effective when I had a mild case not too long ago.    Also... to keep it from spreading, cover the rings with band aids if possible.  You can put the band aids over the lamisil.    They only thing you NEED to watch out for is if he starts getting breakouts on his head.  Ringworm on the head can cause nasty scarring and even prevent future hair growth, leading to bald, scarry patches.
AA11432707	Not likely.    Great idea in theory, but I can almost guarantee that once a nurse, that's what you'll stay.  You can't work while in med school - there's barely enough time to study as it is.  Nursing undergraduate courses are not adequate for pre-med.  You'll need more advanced sciences than are required for a BSN.  So, after you get your RN, you'll need another year or two to prepare before you can even apply to med school.    Medical school is four years.  You don't learn any specialty during that time - it's just to prepare you for residency.  Anesthesia residency is another four years.    Your plan would likely end up being:  4 yrs - BSN  1-2 years taking things like organic chemistry and physics  4 yrs med school  4 yrs residency    Most RNs with that plan stop after the RN, or go on to advanced nursing degrees.  RN -> MD is pretty rare.  It happens, but not very often.  I know a bunch of CRNAs who were going to go to med school but never did.

MOcsfKyMaa	I know what i'm about to tell you can be risky and you'll see why    I myself have a few extra curves. But something i discovered as a real self esteem booster was taking pictures of myself.     The reasons it boosted me was because I had the control.   I would even play dress up sometimes.

Aukt6vHVaa	Ugh vags come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and such. Guys only probably talk trash about a girl down there, because they don't like the girl the vag is attached to. My opinion is don't let some guy see yours if you think he is the kind of person to talk about you that way. Secondly i mean a vag could be so disgusting that it puts people off for many health reasons... STD's, yeast infections, or just poor hygiene, but really if you are safe, clean and tested find a guy that likes you for you, not your vag because its "normal".  Also my best friend and i have similar vags, but our other friends has one that is probably closer to what you said about "saggy" and to us it doesn't matter.

Otherwise, your labia are just fine. This, of course, is different than saying you think you’re labia are just fine, or that you like the way your labia look. We all have parts of our bodies we don’t like or that we worry about from time to time. If you don’t like the way your labia look, I agree that you should do something about it -- but, what you do should be psychological rather than surgical. The increase in questions about labia size seems to suspiciously coincide with a small number ethically challenged plastic surgeons who are trying to make money off of others body image problems, but it would be hard to prove a causal link.<br>  <br>  The fact is that there is no objective “ideal labia” anymore than there is an ideal hair length or nose size (although in my case, I’d have to say “ideal” would mean just a little bit smaller). While there aren’t too many major ramifications of cutting your hair, altering your labia comes with several potentially serious complications. But before we get deep into labia size, we should make sure we’re on the same page in terms of terminology since most of us are not raised learning the proper names for female genitalia.<br>  <br>  There are two sets of labia, the outer labia and the inner labia. The outer labia are what you see if the genitals are not pulled open or if the woman is not aroused. They hide both the inner labia as well as the urethral and vaginal opening. Both sets of labia are rich with nerve endings, and both may respond to sexual stimulation. What little research we have on labia size indicates that there is a wide natural variation in the shape and size of labia.<br>  <br>  Too Big Compared to What?<br>  Because the inner labia are tucked away out of sight, unless you are a gynecologist or someone having sex with lots of other women, you probably haven’t seen that many labia up close and personal. If you’re comparing your labia to bodies you see in pornography, remind yourself that porn isn’t real, and neither are many of those body parts you’re seeing. To get a good look at other labia, check out illustrations you can find for free online (like these and these). Many years ago, Joani Blank produced a beautiful book of full color photos of vulvas called Femalia. More recently a book called Body Drama included photos of vulva, again designed to offer women an accurate point of reference. <br>  <br>  If I Don’t Like My Labia, Why Not Change Them?<br>  There are a small number of cosmetic plastic surgeons performing medically unnecessary cosmetic surgery on female genitalia to alter the look of the genitals (variously called vaginal rejuvenation, labiaplasty, and female cosmetic genital surgery). Despite media hype, these remain fringe procedures, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' official position is that these surgeries show no sign of benefit and carry a variety of risks. For these reasons, the only circumstance under which having your labia surgically altered is recommended is when it is medically necessary (if they are causing pain, preventing you from doing daily activities including having sexual intercourse without pain). <br>  The Bottom Line<br>  Body image is tied up with sexuality in a variety of complicated ways that are difficult to untangle. If you’re unhappy with some part of your body, you should try to do something about it. Talk with friends, a partner, family member, or healthcare provider you trust. It isn’t easy, but you can make change in the way you feel about your body, and sexual expression --alone or with a partner -- can be a great help. If you are experiencing pain during sex and think it might be related to your labia, you can get an answer by seeing your doctor and getting a referral to a gynecologist. "<br>  <br>  I hope the above helped you... Here is a site (below) that you can read that goes into a bit of detail on celebrating the diversity of female vaginas, labias, and clitoris.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/n_html/c_size.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/n_html/c_siz...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you.....|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Don't really know what "normal" vagina lips are supposed to look like, but a camel toe is when a girl wears really tight pants which makes her vagina kind of stick out like a camel's toe.|`|baW9u4yLaa	Everyone is different....there is certainly no set 'standard' or any 'normal' appearance...relax about it...it shouldn't be an issue
kA0xb0MVaa	Depression is a common enough occurrence in most of our lives.  Your body is feeling the effects of stress created by the depression.  You should seek some counseling, and they can give you some meds to help you feel better.  As well as, a professional who will listen and help you deal with the depression.  Good Luck.|`|BGpykTMYaa	reaction to heartache varies from person to person. if all thise things you have mentioned is affecting your daily life you better seek counseling.|`|bLplapNIaa	I don't think you'll find a single girl out there who hasn't went through heartache at least once in their life! What you are feeling is unfortunately how it feels and let me tell you - it sucks!     However, with that being said if it is affecting your health you need to talk to someone! When you are depressed your immune system slows down and you are less able to fight off infection, your appetite decreases so your body isn't as well nourished. Also bottling everything up inside isn't good for your mental health. You need to talk to someone, friends, counsellors, your parents(?) anyone you think will listen.     You need to heal from this my dear and realize that life does go on. It may not seem like it right now but you'll be just fine. You have to take care of yourself first because just think you need to be 100% for when the next great guy comes around!|`|k0x99dGraa	The one time I was in love I had similar problems. I too got physically sick so it's not crazy. It helps a lot to find something that you enjoy, and then get involved in it. Say you like painting... then join a class, say you like listening to music... then plan on going to a concert with a group of friends. STAY BUSY, Become committed to something that you love and that your in control of. You may have loved this guy... but your not in control of him. Remember he is just a guy... and unless you find yourself again your only going to attract similarly depressed people.... in turn never getting out of this cycle. Look for the things in life that still make you happy... dont say there isn't anything... and then step by step fill your life with those things! Good luck!   PS. You will always love this guy, you just might not always be IN LOVE with him. and once you can love him with out being in love with him is when those stomach pains go away. :-)

Do you have sharp pain under your right rib cage that kinda goes arround to your back? If so it could be galstones or a diseased gallbladder (which there is no test that will detect that only surgery) I know this from experience.

If there isn't too much damage to veins and nerves it shouldn't be a problem.  But if it has come completely out it may cause later problems so you need to take him to a dentist.    http://www.whmc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id...|`|33830adac8471178d652a04c4a347442aa	Why don't you call your dentist.

yfwY8XGlaa	your therapist should help you with that issue.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Yes, he is family and he isn't supposed to do things like that.|`|xjZNnFLtaa	Possibly|`|AA10824931	Yes it can and it can create a domino effect until you face it.  I have know women who remembered they were molested some 30 years after it happened.  It's good that you are talking with a therapist.  Don't hold anything back.  About your cutting, I suggest an acupuncturist as well.  If the cutting is from a condition called interior wind, they can relieve the symptom of wanting to rip your skin open to get relief.  It can be caused by the chemicals in the food.  Good luck from a person who was also molested and learn how to stop the craziness.|`|0xV86BdPaa	yes what happened to your brother in law

Feel better.|`|0cCZkuBOaa	-Try a teaspoon of honey.

The real main point of the "cure" is to knock you out so as you can sleep.  everyone knows that sleep helps one to get over ailments.|`|AA10270012	try gurgle warm water and salt|`|feyZ3bkBaa	Make a mixture of tea, honey, apple cider vinegar, and a hint of lemon.|`|ROV3shkNaa	Make a clove tea and sip the warm solution. Warm salty solutions help like chicken or beef broth sipped slowly also helps unless you are on a salt restricted diet. Aspirin is a good topical pain reliever. Chewable aspirin works or powdered aspirin (Goodies, BC Powders). Lozenges like Cepacol with benzocaine or sprays will help some. Advil will hep but take time to work 45+ minutes and Tylenol works a little but not good for swollen throat
MkZC5gd6aa	Really, really low bodyfat... aka diet and exercise.    We all have perfect abdominal muscles underneath. But for most women, to even attempt such a thing could be hazerdous to your health, because of the low amount of bodyfat involved...
hiToH4kCaa	Oh man who wouldn't want to be like Selena? She was amazing, no doubt.     Well first thing I'm gonna tell you is to be happy with yourself. Believe in yourself. You absolutely have to be happy with yourself in order to gain confidence! Love yourself!     Don't change! Be yourself. Don't be someone you're not! You can still be like Selena without changing your personality. If you wanna be funny like her, be witty. Get creative. In freshman year I was the girl that looked down at the floor, that everyone would crash into. I never really talked and I was so quiet in class. My version of being funny seemed faked or staged out. I wasn't funny at all. Then I started gaining confidence, and getting creative with jokes and comments. You are funniest when you are being yourself. Now I am pretty social and during lunch and class, I feel like I can shine because I am happy and everyone knows it just by looking at me. When you are happy with yourself, that's when people just kinda come to you. You gain charisma.     Lastly, don't sit around your house! Get out there! Meet new people! Call someone up and ask them to hang with you! Attend a dance workshop or something that you love doing. I'm sure people want to meet you and be your friend. You're friends are there for you to be yourself, and for you to act goofy and stuff like that. Good Luck and Hope I Helped!

I worked off 20 pounds, it really does produce success!
U3EiMHYJaa	what you're describing to me sounds like a calcium or iron deficiency. drink lots of milk or calcium supplements. what you eat has a lot of impact on your body. try consulting a dietitian or even google up necessary vitamins and minerals. i hope your nails get well because i know how important nails are for girls.|`|yKXxtrhsaa	Folic acid, also known as folate. It's in things like spinach, etc. Look it up.|`|8VEEihaqaa	JELLO!!!|`|7I4xa4NHaa	multi vitamin, or lots of different fruits and vegies
d5KySuEFaa	Pills will mess with your system.  If you exercise and diet properly you won't need them.  Pills are a wsted expense and only work for a very short term, and will not have long lasting effects.  If you use them you will rely on them and probably not exercise or eat properly which are very important.  Dont mess with your metabolism.  Diet pills often cause anxiety, which at 14 I am sure you have enough of, and can damage your organs.  Drink only water and cut out sweets or fast food with a workout and you will be fine.  You need to have some calories so don't starve yourself, so your body can process and burn fat while building lean muscle (which helps lose fat weight as well).|`|FcqOie0zaa	I wouldn't use diet pills if I were you. They are expensive and contain laxatives and caffeine. Just eat healthily and work out.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	NONE    im 20 160lb. im gunna just tone down... no pills....|`|NXimjHa7aa	Pills are for 18+ dumb girl.    Exercise you lazy oaf, that's how you became fat.|`|yYgsyopAaa	You sooooo should not take diet pills. Bad idea. Bad habit to get started so young in life. As far as weight loss, exercise is the key. Everyone will tell you it's diet, that "you are what you eat", nope. Exercise burns calories ~ calories not burned turn to stored energy... a pretty way of saying fat. Thus, to lose weight, you need to burn calories. How much fun is that??|`|LhvLMsyWaa	your way to young to be using diet pills   what u should do is exercise eat well and definatly dont starve yourself cuz when you finally do eat something your body just stores it and you get fatter|`|z5k0ZTt6aa	Try cutting your meals and exercising.   Use any kind of pill last. You don't know how they will affect you.|`|gH7wqHrdaa	Actually, you don't need to diet in fact in order to lose weight, the sole thing that definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|OujhXy2yaa	being 14 you shouldn't be using diet pills or homeopathic remedies at all because they can effect your body and mind growth...  you should just work on exercising more and eating fewer calories (this does not necessarily mean eating less) eating smaller meals more frequently and more filling foods like nuts, berries, celery, and drink water when you're thirsty instead of soda or juice|`|XDf8xSyyaa	No diet pills!  You're 14!!  Try to start a healthy eating eating plan and exercise.

UZxeBrxQaa	There are women who would kill to have your body.    However, true beauty comes from within.  Be yourself.  Let people see you for who you are.  Never, ever, date a guy because he thinks you are "hot".      Watch their eyes.  If he looks into yours, then he knows enough to sense there is someone at home in your head that needs attention.|`|e4ba687fef0f0cf91aee345fda8cb98caa	this sizes are really good except the stomach, i like the stomach with some fat on it|`|dqa1hD9laa	i agree with ari..|`|72iZuDjeaa	i will accept your apology,,, but just this once...|`|nsVbWXKraa	add a photo of urself...|`|cngrEZRHaa	Sounds real good to me!|`|359acab69e373a5054bd503451816a87aa	Let me ask you this: Why do you care what other people think of you? Why does it matter if a guy thinks your boobs are too small?  Or if your waist is too small? All that matters is what YOU think. If you think you are beautiful, then it doesn't matter what guys or anyone else for that matter thinks.    Don't change yourself to make a guy like you. It's never worth it!
p9DW7iRfaa	Depends.    Health food store peanut butter, no.    Any other peanut butter? Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan, etc.? Yes.|`|PBMZKeXoaa	no itis not. Its not as healthy as turkey or ham for lunch but peanut butter is mostly peanuts which is from the lagoon family which is very good for you. Peanut butter may seem to have a high fat but its natural good fat. Almonds and cheese are higher in fat too. Ask yourself what seems healthier peanut butter or potato chips|`|Vj13f7zmaa	EXTREMELY fattening.  One serving has 200 calories in it.. 180 of those calories are fat calories.  So very fattening. You can have it in your diet, but be aware that it is packed with cals.|`|DWCSDzo4aa	NO! Based on the newly proposed FDA regulations about trans fat labeling, peanut butter would declare ZERO (0) trans fat. Independent analyses of peanut butters by The Peanut Institute have shown extremely low levels of trans fat. Some peanut butter contains a very small amount of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to help prevent oil separation, which is preferable to most consumers. These oils contribute an insignificant amount of trans fat.
ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	Wow.  What a question, and you have bared your soul, haven't you?    Okay.  It's pretty normal.  I'm a male and it has been a long time (50 years) since I have been your age, but I have also experienced what we call "galloping hormones."    Don't feel guilty about masturbating.  It's a normal and fairly healthy release.  Arousal is very normal at your age, for guys, too.  You will have a boyfriend at some point.  My advice is to be extremely careful about getting into sexual relations with anyone.  There are a lot of risks.    It is so easy to ruin your life by getting into the wrong relationship that the smart thing to do is just what you are doing.    And don't feel guilty or worry about being abnormal.  You aren't.  Teenagers are just at that stage when their bodies are changing and the hormones are ready to conquer the world.    You sound very intelligent.  Stay intelligent.  And don't worry about your hormone levels.  50 years from now you will wish you could have saved some.|`|3b0iEteqaa	Normal-Normal--and did I say--Normal
Vj13f7zmaa	Technically, yes.  But your surgeon may not want to do that.  It is really up to them.
780bLw5Waa	Im thinking.. try degree clinical strength also remember that your hormones are going all crazy this is a period of time when you might be a little more sweaty in life...    :) im sure the boys wont mind... who cares we all sweat|`|MOcsfKyMaa	Try one of those Under Amour Shirts. They fit tight to your body but they are suppose to absorb moisture.  I have a sports bra that works wonderfully. You can wear it under your gym shirt and you can find them at a sports store. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Armou... ) Maybe wearing a wife beater under can absorb some of the sweat so it doesn't show through to your gym T. Also combine that with stronger deodorant. Deodorant doesn't just have to go on your arm pits, you can try it in other areas of your body. Maybe throw in some baby powder on your chest.    I think guys won't find sweat un attractive tho. I mean, it is GYM. Plus, i promise you, they are stinkier =)  Anyway, good luck.
OdLj07Svaa	nah ur right mine lasts at least a week its normal for some people to have theirs longer than other its gotta do with genetics or something just dont freak out theres nothin wrong lol|`|L3NA7Ywnaa	mine last about 5-7 days too... its normal though no worries really and your siblings dont affect the length of your period|`|zxaqL885aa	that normal. my mom gets hers for almost 2 weeks. mine is about 5 days or so...sometimes 3 or 4 and sometimes 7 or 8. it just depends.|`|AeGsY5O4aa	well mine last for 3-4 days but my friends last for a week so its perfectly normal.  everyone is different   i have two sisters lol but i dont think that has to do with anything

Do this with wheat, etc....)  *virus or bacteria from food.       If this doesn't yield any answers you'll likely need some medical tests.

YQk8zW6caa	you dont really need a plan  more of a life style.  if you are trying to lose weight invest in a good pare of running shoes  running is cardio it burns fat, also invest in those strech bands.  so after your 15 min run or w/e do some strength training, incorp that with goos eating and in 6 weeks or so you will se resaluts|`|HA2IV3r3aa	Just do it.

I guess they want you to be absolutely sure that you don't want any children. My guess is that the reversal procedure is a lot harder to do.

G9oeY7tsaa	okay fine if you die, though, do you relize God wont let you into heaven for killing your self|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think hormones can cause it so if you notice you feel better in a few weeks you will need to find out what you can do to improve your health. I know women get that way sometimes before or during their period & it is because they have things that depress them that they don't do anything about but it bothers them more when the hormones are raging. The awareness just might not be there. I also get this way in Dec. because my son died in Dec. & all these memories of what went on come back.

The most important thing to realize that this is not really the normal.  You need to talk about it and get some counseling.  If you decide to talk to your doctor than he might prescribe some medication.  If this is not what you want than a school counselor or a priest or the like can help point you in the right direction.  If not helping you them self.  Depending on your parents you could try talking to them.  Some parents might understand, some might not.  The very least you need to talk to someone.    Asking the question here is the first step and now you need to make another step.|`|6cDaLogfaa	yeah...just pray and tell the demons surrouning you that they have no power over you and to leave now in the name of jesus!|`|KRDZ5AQyaa	Some suicidal thoughts can occur because of a chemical imbalance in the brain while others are caused by distressing situational conditions, low self-esteem, or even a combination of the aforementioned three situations.      Today, there are a wide array of antidepressants and anti-psychotic medicines that are used by psychiatrists to help their patients cope with these feelings; there is also benefit to be gained from participating in psychotherapy.

If you have suicidal thoughts, you should talk to someone - a doctor, cleryperson, family member - someone. You may find taking an anti-depressant helps. In my experience, drug therapy works best with talk therapy so you may want to schedule an appointment with your family doctor and a psychotherapist.    Good luck!!! And know you are not alone. There are millions of people who suffer the same way you are now.|`|r1UQZTjraa	dont worry, its just a thought,  people always have thoughts about "what would it be like if i never existed"  but, dont do it,  you probably havent known anyone close t you who has taken their life...but if you have, well, thats your buissiness and you should know what im talking about when i say that sit a veryy horrible thing and its an irreversable decision and killing yourself for "no reason" isnt worth it,  so try and ignore the suicidal thoughts and go tobagganing or something :)
ParFJxnSaa	You may well be suffering from  PTSD:  There is a quiz for the presence of P.T.S.D., via page E, in ezy build, below. Some of the symptoms include "flashbacks", sleep disorders, especially nightmares, and just staring blankly. See Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris in sections 33 - 34, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators in sections 33 - 34, and section 1, and phone book, and/or various associations for psychiatrists and psychologists, to find the nearest one using EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy).    In EMDR, a therapist will ask you to revisit a traumatic event and remember the feelings, negative thoughts, or memories associated with it. While you are doing this, the therapist will hold up two fingers about eighteen inches from your face and move them from side to side. You will be told to track the movement of the therapists fingers with your eyes. As you concentrate on the traumatic event during therapy, you are trying to bring its memory to life. The mental imagery you are able to conjure up during the therapy session is then processed, aided by your eye movements, facilitating the processing of painful memories, enabling some of the powerful emotional states involved to be discharged to some degree, and helping to achieve resolution and a state involving less painful emotions.    EMDR has 8 stages. Professional EMDR is always much preferable, and Opester, (who gives it a glowing recommendation) a therapist with more than 20 years experience, and a former contributor, here, stated that it was one of only two disorders which can be completely cured.If unable to afford it, or to locate one nearby, contact the county/local mental health agency: any therapy on offer may prove helpful, particularly if combined with appropriate medication. Contact your county/local mental health agency, and find out what help they can offer. (U.S.A.) Try phoning 211, or 411, and Google: "clinics; mhmr; (your city); (your state)" Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is also used successfully, with PTSD.    There is advice on recurring dreams & nightmares in section 3, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris. Remember the troubling nightmare in as much detail as you can. Create a scenario in which you manage to prevail. "Tonight, in my dreams, I want to confront the ???/call on a dream ally for help". Write down your chosen form on a piece of paper, at least 3 times, and repeat 3 times aloud, after lights out, and visualise yourself doing it, as vividly as you can, and WANT TO DO IT!!!, with all the desire you can muster, to better communicate this concept to your subconscious mind, through imagery & emotional intensity, so it understands that this is important. Place the piece of paper under your pillow (metaphorically "sleeping on it"). Your subconscious existed before you could walk, or talk. It knows images, muscles/movement, and emotions: communicate with it in terms it can understand.      It doesn't understand negatives. When dreaming, try calling for assistance from a dream character - anyone, alive or long since passed on, even your favorite superhero is available to provide assistance, in the dreamstate.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	it will take a lot of time to feel better, maybe you need a different therapist (tell your parents and family your concerns). Sometimes it takes a lot of effort and a lot of psychiatrists to feel better about something that really bothers you..|`|23bs0kAKaa	well tell your mom that your not over it, that kind of thing is really hard if not impossible to get over!

God Bless.|`|ahfzZ665aa	I was also molested at 5 yrs old and I had all sorts of screwed up dreams for years, and then began cutting to release the anger and frustration. Be careful you need to talk to someone you dont want it to lead in that direction. You need to see someone and talk about it. You are going through Post traumatic stress disorder. My nightmares went away gradually as I got older. But it still haunts me to this day, but I had a reallt screwed up childhood and was beaten and stuff and what helps me with my nightmares is my kitty. He will come up and snuggle in my neck and i fall right asleep and have no more nightmares. Try to find something thats comforting and sleep with it...it might help. Or maybe try knocking yourself out with some sleeping pills. Honestly, you need to get it out, it will affect your nightmares though...but eventually they will start to fade. Please talk to someone
RKMgokm6aa	Please don't listen to David. He has no clue what he is talking about. I am not a representative of any nutrition companies, but I have used tons of different supplements, all with positive results, no side effects. Prohormones are just natural chemicals, usually lots of herbal compounds, that have been shown to raise testosterone levels in the body. They are completely safe to take, and he won't need a post-cycle. Typically you post cycle after taking steroids. These, however, are not even close to steroids, and don't have any side effects. I hope he gets bigger. Tell him to eat a lot.|`|3tFMYYt8aa	if you use steroids right, and follow a proper pct protocol, you will be very satisfied  i am 14 years old and have done 4 cycles of PH,DS, and Steroids  including tren xtreme, halodrol, epistane, and a Test E/dbol cycle, i know everyone probably thinks this is insane, but i have never had any adverse side effects, and have always done a proper on cycle and post cycle pct    if you are interested in using steroids and have acne problems  do not take steroids, a pro hormone would better suite you as most actual steroids cause sever acne post cycle    bud look up H-drol or Epistane  they are the two safest pro hormones out there, the health risks are very low, and its your life do what YOU want to do  half the things people say about steroids are NOT proven    i would look into a 6 week hdrol cycle  your going to need a few things for pct  a SERM is not needed, but you will need an ATD    heres everything you need for pct/on cycle support    NAC- 1500mg on cycle for liver  Red yeast rice- blood pressure  Inhibit-E- ATD post cycle to get your hormones balanced again    normally if you do a steroid cycle you would need to do a standard nolva pct of 40/30/20/10 but for h-drol it isnt needed    h-drol is not a miracle drug and no steroid is  you need a dead on diet, hard training, and dedication  steroids are 15% of the task, the rest is hard work    research this stuff some more then try it out  he will only get one first cycle  make sure he is getting 3-4000 calories and 200+ grams of protein per day, and have a clean diet, i suggest epistane for bulking/ and hdrol for cutting  both are very very mild and have minimal side effects    a PCT or post cycle therapy consists of supplements or prescription drugs used to get hormones back to normal|`|Mm2yIwGgaa	All supplements, with the exception of protein powder are bad. Its all a scam. They do work, but only if you take them constantly. They are expensive, and if you stop taking them, your body will become dependent upon them and you will acutally get weaker with out them. Be a good GF and keep him away from them. There are MANY other ways to get big without those things. Eat healthy, work out correctly and consistently (he may need a trainer), drink lots of water and take protien powder. Good luck

Just get into a gym. You get your muscles stronger, they teach you proper nutrition, proper form, it sets you up for life. I'm guessing your quite young if you are considering this, so i will just say this even if you already know. Your teenage years are the most important years of your life for body development. Not only does your body mature and blossom, but it begins strengthening bones, building muscle, and your mind gets into it's habits that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. If you do this, you will not be taking in the nessasary vitamins and minerals your body needs to operate or sustain it's strength. Who cares what people think of you? So somebody doesn't like you because ya got some love handles, well screw them. If they are avoiding you because of your body in the first place then they obviously aren't interested in a relationship and settling down anyways. And you can use this as motivation while working out too! Who knew something so negative could actually be worth jack all. Whatever you do, make sure you think about it everyday.

zMD0VeOmaa	a lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction. it has many different applications. for example, in a car lubricant can be used to reduce the friction caused by the engine parts rubbing together. think about how much damage your engine would get without oil.    in sex lubricant can be used to reduce the friction between your hands and your private parts, which can be uncomfortable if there's alot of dry friction. without lubricant you might get sore.    also a lubricant can be used to reduce mental friction. for example alcohol is a social lubricant that helps people with anxiety to open up more.    I'm sure there are more examples but these are some of the more common ones.|`|UgS1Jpu8aa	It's like grease on a door hinge.|`|AOnNtUNLaa	it goes on yr dick so when you stick it inside of your friends buttocks it will go in and out smoothly|`|d2zGNPUoaa	anything to make things rub against eachother easier|`|6cN8aLnaaa	Sexual lubricant, if this is what you are referringto is used when a woman can't produce enough moisture to have sex comfortably.

(there's all kinds of different types of personal lubricant) and there's the natural kind that women's vaginas produce when they are sexually aroused. hope that helped|`|LuIsLQH2aa	It can be used as different things. For instance, it can be used to help something slide better (like if you put butter all over a slip 'n' slide that could be considered a lubricant), or if a woman can't produce enough lubricant to her liking (or at all) during sex.
9dyPKI9Vaa	LIsten...on my thirteenth birthday my mom took me to a counselor and she said i have "severe chronic depression" and prescribed me ...zoloft i think it was (i was on a few different ones but they all did this...) the first few weeks ....you seriously need someone to watch out for you.  you WILL do weird stuff you wouldnt do normally ...like...plan your death...harm yourself....sniff wierd chemicals..im not even kidding it warns you too on the label it says the patient may feel extremely suicidal with the first few weeks of taking these. i sure did. and i thought i was already depressed. those pills i think made me even more crazy i enevtually pretended i was swallowing them then flushed them in the toilet. i would even overdose on them! why!? i dont know...they made me crazy i say. i didnt care about anything but harming myself. thats all i did. my mom found out and basically it was an ongoing battle of forcing me to take antidepressants. i would take them with soda cans and just push the pill in the can with my tongue as i was "swallowing" it...but anyway...i would try counseling first.  sometimes you jsut need someone to hear you out and you hear their view...it helps...

Q4ggnG0waa	Most cases of mononucleosis are caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you're infected with EBV, you carry the virus  usually in a dormant state  for the rest of your life. Periodically, however, the virus may reactivate. When this happens, the virus can be detected in your saliva  but you're not likely to become ill. Rarely, reactivated EBV may cause illness in people who have weak immune systems.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	speak with your doctor.|`|PleCBQeqaa	A person normally only gets mono once (if they get it at all)    However, it can reoccur in rare cases, so if you really suspect mono then see a doctor and have blood work done so they can catch it early if it is reoccurring.

Go buy yourself some generic flip flops, don't touch the floor with bare feet.
g8pRhElsaa	no, not that you're pregnant necessarily. i also get nauseous from my birth control pills. if the blue pills have more hormones than the others, that would explain it. definitely take them with a little food and water if you don't already, and if you still get nauseous, you can switch to ortho tricyclen lo (it's what i'm on) or start taking them before you go to bed so you can sleep through the nausea.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|enbB895Paa	it could be that you are taking them on an empty stomach or without water. same thing happens when i take vitamins. i have puked them up before even =[
Z8d9ipxmaa	It's because they're only interested in their wages. Dentists get paid more for certain procedures, and many of them consider that rather than what'd best fit their patient. They might tell you that need something doing, when you don't really.     I know they've got to make a living, but part of their job is being good to their patients!|`|YedeSYjmaa	"MOST" dentists?

Wn4tjazIaa	unless your teacher is A.) a nosy person or B.) a concerned teacher, they're not really going to ask you who you are. If they answer, "No, but if you tell me your problem and who you are maybe I can help" then don't reply. If they go, "Sorry, there are no guidance counselors, but if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm here." Then it's a go.    If there's no guidance counselor, consider asking one of your favorite teachers if they can hear you out.|`|oq0jpqAgaa	say you're another students mother.|`|lfg4PXZ4aa	I doubt it. Generally teachers want students to feel safe and comfortable in their environment. Until it reaches a severe level, they really try to keep the trust of the student by respecting confidentiality.     Go ahead and email your teacher. If you want, you can even include something in the email like, "This is regarding a sensitive issue for me, and I would prefer to remain anonymous. Thank you."    Good luck!

Technically, males continue to grow into their early 20s. However, most growth is pretty much done by 18/19. It is, though, an individual thing.

x3PLREEuaa	The television series The Dukes of Hazzard followed Bo and Luke Duke, two cousins living in a rural part of the fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, racing around in their modified 1969 Dodge Charger, The General Lee, evading corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg and his inept county sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Bo and Luke had been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine - their uncle Jesse made a plea bargain to stop brewing moonshine in return for the boys to forgo jail time and instead be placed on probation. As a result, Bo and Luke were not allowed to carry firearms (they often used compound bows) or leave Hazzard County (although the exact details of their probation terms varied from episode to episode; sometimes it was implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it was shown that they may leave Hazzard as long as they were back within a certain time limit).|`|iBPqutK5aa	It's probably just a birth defect, just like conjoined twins and two headed animals

nksewi03aa	It is a little known fact that about 75% of contact lenses on the market today are made with a type of plastic that actually protects your eyes against U.V. light.   You should never substitute your contacts for protective goggles in the tanning booth or at the beach though because they can only protect you from the U.V. portion of the light spectrum, not the infrared (heat) and brightness portion of light, both of which could harm your eyes.<br>  <br>  Soft contact lenses are mainly water.  Though direct U.V. exposure won't damage them, except after many many exposures, the heat of the tanning bulbs will certainly dry them out   Dry contacts will irritate your eyes, and in extreme cases can "stick" to your cornea so tightly that removing them might tear or damage your corneas.<br>  <br>  In short, is it ok if, one time, you forgot to take out your contacts? Yes, you'll be fine.  Do you want to wear them everytime you sun tan? No, avoid that.|`|rxjdovzyaa	This is probably not the answer you want, but why are you tanning anyway?

rev4lrn0aa	Since you are bleeding heavily it is possible that you are becoming anemic from a lack of iron. You should see your doctor about this so they can possibly give you some iron pills or look into if something more serious is going on (possibly a cyst or something like that). Also, you may want to consider going on birth control because it will usually lighten and shorten your period. Good luck and have yourself checked out so it doesn't get any worse!

What happens is it shuts down the autonomic nervous system. That system controls basic body functions. (breathing, heartbeat, and digestive system).

ParFJxnSaa	It may well be caused/exacerbated by something different, such as a mineral, (magnesium?) or vitamin deficiency. View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively).     The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.    Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.    Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past. Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge (professional is best). Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread. A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, (also see the first page: ANXIETY: WHAT REALLY WORKS website) and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective.

Im a sophomore too, in middle school and elementary school, grades were my life. I wasnt very popular, so grades were all i had going for me. In my freshman year, i realized that grades werent everything, but still strived for them. I got put down many times, test after aching test, and realized that it wasnt worth it. Sure, i studied, but getting a bad grade was i tried my best, and getting a good grade was i tried my best. Feeling of not caring, we've ALL been there. Its like the world/the man is just making me take tests as another way of controlling my future or something like that (That 70's show enlightened me to "the man" concept) But now im a little bit more popular, i hang out with kids, i filtered out people and realized who my true friends are, and if you dont care about your grades dont worry, you will realize grades arent everything soon enough, and you will eventually get back on track.

This is a perfectly normal way to feel, but a little extreme in your case maybe. Most sophomores have very little idea of where their life will lead in ten minutes time, let alone ten years time. Try to do subjects in school that you enjoy - you will find it easier to do well in them and try not to focus on doing them for getting into college, just enjoy learning and doing your assignments for the moment - the rest will follow. It is only a few unlucky people who know they want to be a doctor, lawyer etc. when they finish school. For the rest of us life is much more exciting! I still don't know where my life is going, but I am making sure that I have fun on the ride. One of my best friends did a science bachelor degree - now he works for a charity doing projects for children in Brazilian slums - neither of us imagined when we were sixteen that was what he would do, we both assumed he would become a pharmacist.    Try not to beat yourself up about being a confused young person - life has a funny way of working out - like I said, enjoy the ride.

Q6ig8k7Xaa	I am going to disagree with the above poster, in that I noticed a change the next day when I started taking lithium, and very quickly when I started taking Wellbutrin.    Currently I am taking Lithium, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal.    The Lamictal stabilized my mood a bit so my lows were not as low. It help curb suicidal thoughts.     The Wellbutrin helped improve my mood since I was still depressed, but it also puts me at the risk of becoming manic (well hypomanic), so the lithium was added.    Lithium narrowed my range of emotions, not to say I can't be happy or sad, just that the extremes are evened out. It also slowed down my thoughts, which I dislike, but has enabled me to focus more, and has made me much more articulate and communicative in person.    People stop taking their medication is for a number of reasons.    Sometimes they aren't really working and people just get frustrated.    Many people like being manic, they just hate the depression part, so meds lift their mood, but makes them think life is boring.    Side effects is the other big one. Lithium for example can cause you to gain a lot of weight, it kills your sex drive, and is a pain to monitor since you need blood tests regularly.    It can also give you permanent kidney damage.|`|AA12357988	The first time you take them, you don't feel anything from the pills themselves.  One may feel a sense of relief knowing they are beginning treatment, and that they will soon feel better.  Sometimes, it takes months, because not every medication combination works for everyone.  If a person is severely bi-polar, they may stop taking their medications when they are feeling 'better'.  This is very common with severe cases of mental illness, such as schizophrenia.  My friend's friend has been hospitalized numerous times since high school due to exactly that.    As for being forced to take them, you generally can't.  I suppose it would vary from state to state.  My mother works in a psych ward, and you CANNOT force them to take their medications without a court order.      Some people don't like taking their medications for various reasons: cost, having to take multiple pills on a daily basis, and side effects, such as drowsiness, feeling 'numb', and weight gain.      EDIT: ANti-psychotics and benzos may act quickly, but the vast majority of anti-depressants and mood stabilizers take anywhere from a few days to a month to start seeing real results.

pb1CcCbXaa	Its hard to feel better sometimes. Everyone has there own way of dealing with hurt or stress. Dont feel discouraged. Take a few deep breaths. And try and find something you like to do. <br>     It doesnt always work for me... but I love to draw. When your down often you feel the desire to express your feelings, just to get it out. Sometimes I draw. I think really hard, and I try and put it onto paper. Or I write a story- often about someone who is going through the same thing I am.  This wouldn't work for anyone who didnt like to draw or write though. Maybe try sports, different forms of art, or what not. And often when you do something amazing, it gives you a certain sense of pride.

I wish I had a sure answer that would definitely help you feel better. Do you have depression? If so you might need to talk to someone--a counselor or therapist. Maybe you need some fun things to do, like some hobbies you enjoy or you can try some new things. Hopefully you will start to feel better soon.|`|Atae1dnkaa	i feel that way to, but your not alone
SOfbIOzUaa	I didn't know you smoked! Learn to love yourself and stop doing that, permanently.    My wife has high blood pressure as well but only her systolic is high and it is all over the place anywhere from 130 to 170 or more. so far she takes no medication for it. She has tried many natural things but I won't mention what exactly except that we just ordered a product that sounds promising which you can find on eBay.    It's called Mukta Vati and the testimonials including many which are on independent sites such as curezone.com. google it and see what you think. It is sold by some vendors with a money back guarantee if it doesn't work for you.    That said you should [as anyone should] try to live a healthy lifestyle. Eat less animal products, avoid refined foods, eat mostly plant based foods & 50% raw if possible. And never mind avoiding salt; use sea salt. Drink plenty of water and get sufficient exercise. And start reading health related books.    There are many suggestions for controlling high blood pressure. Some work for some people and many don't. the same is true of drugs but they have side effects, some of which are serious in themselves [Whatever happened to "First do no harm"?]  There are many things that cause high blood pressure and sometimes the cause is simply unknown which can partly explain why what works for one person may not work for the next person.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	your blood pressure is not as crazy as your pulse! WOW    a normal pulse is 120/80, a little up or down is fine. If the two numbers are far apart (160/60) that is concerning. Your top   (systolic) is fine, your bottom   (diastolic) is also fine for someone with blood pressure issues. You need to see your nurse or doctor to explain all your medications to you and to explain exactly what different blood pressure readings/ pulse counts mean to you and when it is safe to take your med's. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.    propanalol is a blood pressure med and you should not take it if your blood pressure is ever low, regardless if you are shaky - you also can not stop taking this med cold-turkey. See your doctor or find a new one.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Why are you checking your BP so much?  Has your doctor put you on antihypertensives?  Is your doctor concerned?? 111/90 is not considered high!  I think you are stressing and this causes it to fluctuate, and so does 2 packs a cigarettes per day!  You seem worried about your BP but not worried about continuing to smoke 2 packs per day!!  My advice is: try and quit the habit again as you did very well before, stop stressing about you BP, leave it to the health professionals and stop checking it yourself!  Lastly, THROW OUT THE BP MACHINE!!!  I'm not being mean to you, it's just some things need to be left up to the health professionals for a reason - because we know whats going on and why things are what they are, and people that monitor themselves at home like this end up stressing over things that might not need stressing over.|`|bLplapNIaa	Propanalol is a blood pressure medication (it's a beta blocker) and this could be the cause of your numbers being all over the place. You should really speak to your doctor about your blood pressure readings. Sometimes the cuff that you are using, the time of day you are testing, whether you just came in for a smoke, whether you want to go out for one right then, all these factors can influence a blood pressure reading. Your doctor will not diagnose you after only one reading, he/she will do up to 3 readings at different times and make a diagnosis based on that. Tell him/her that you are on propanalol!!|`|XDf8xSyyaa	Hey, I agree with Monika here.  Especially since you've got anxiety as well, you are making yourself worse by trying to self-diagnose and checking your own BP.  This is not a good idea, please get your nurse or doctor to do the checking and for gods sake - throw the machine away!!  Hope you feel better real soon.  Also Propanalol is a drug that needs to be taken regularly and daily!  Not willy-nilly.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	I also use beta-blockers but they are to control my heart rate.  You have to take the medication as prescribed, or you'll be all over the place.If you've suffered from a rapid heart rate for a long time I would suggest you go and see a cardiologist, with your anxiety fast heart rate and blood pressure you could be looking at a heart problem.  I'am not trying to scare you but I had the same signs for years now faced with heart problems,it would be in your best interest.|`|EPVWrEOxaa	for 111/90 the 111 isnt high ... the 90 is a LITTLE high.  the fact that you smoke doesnt help    you should tell ur dr. everything youve said here.. also taking propanalol once in a while isnt recommended.. when taking a drug like that you should be taking it every day. but seriously you should talk to your doctor|`|QEIKzdzlaa	Stop Smoking!!  That 111/90 - not bad on the top number, you want the bottom number to be about 75. Try taking your blood pressure in the morning then in the afternoon and record each one.  You should run a pattern - low in morning, high in afternoon or vice versa. Blood pressure problems are hereditary.  Keep a check on it and make a Dr appointment.  Take your findings to the Doc and get a professional opinion.
EW9Dgbz7aa	5x5?  sounds like you will be building more muscle    less reps = bigger muscle  you dont wanna look like a butch do you? - i assumed you were a girl by your picture up there  more reps less weight = toned slim and sexy|`|HA2IV3r3aa	If you want to get toned, do not increase your protein intake.  In order to get ripped, you need to do two things:  1) Burn fat  2) Do muscular endurance exercises to increase muscle definition.  Muscular definition exercises involve using light weights and high repetitions with 30 second rests between each set.  Hope this helps!

I had wanted to play a little longer so I could avoid meeting with my accountant just so he could remind me how rich I am, but then I had no excuse.

3RNJ5uNRaa	good news....you're already skinny. so you're good for febuary 8th!  but if you are so retarded you think your fat, then here's just a lil advice:  do not stop eating, because your body will go into starvation mode, and your metabolism will slow down, and you'll get fatter, and bloat...  try eating around 1500 calories a day...you should be fine. 400 is close to starving yourself.  do not eat any candy, junk food, or fast food...that will ruin everything!  avoid foods with high SODIUM content on the nutrient facts...that means a lot of salt! which causes your body to retain water, making you look even fatter!!! nooooooo...  if you're hungry, eat...dont starve yourself...grab a handful of nuts and stick those in your mouth because they're full of fiber which is great and also they cure hunger pains...but dont overdo it on nuts cuz they can be fatttty  wake up every morning and run. jog for twenty minutes. randomly do 40 crunches at a time throughout the day. move a lot...clean your room...shovel the snow...turn up your favorite song and dance for the whole song...take a break...dance to another...admire yourself...you'll be fine. just keep movin and dont give into bad foods.|`|zd73p42Waa	Honey you are 14 and weigh 105...that is not fat! that is normal....and u will lower ur metabolism if u plain out not eat! so don't do that...instead snack on healthy things every 3 hrs and that will help kick ur metabolism....go walking and dont worry, cause you are beautiful no matter what people think....don't get into a bad habit.|`|F6znYVAwaa	ur pathetic no offense  live your life|`|Iibh8kdzaa	You can't.

c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	See a Dr...|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	You have some kind of sinus problem which makes pressure in your head and causes pain.  Try putting a hot pack on over your face, inhale steam, drink lots of extra water.  Try a medicine called "guaifenisen". It liquefies mucus and helps clean all your airways out. It is a cheap, effective, safe drug.  Sometimes one of your sinuses can get blocked and even have a vacuum like condition in it that really hurts.  Even spending some time in  a hot shower can help loosen up and moisturize your sinuses.  If you have fever or chills, you have an infection.  Go to a doctor for antibiotics.  Otherwise, you need to get your sinuses clean and healthy again.  You can get salt water (saline)  nasal spray or you can put salt in warm water and put it up your nose.  Look up "neti pot".  These things can really help with sinus problems.

Cold flashes?  loss touch of reality?  That tells me it is something going on in your brain.  And sounds are blurred?   Do you see colors?  or flashes?  or stars? any of that?  Even feeling heavy suggests the part of your brain that controls balance is being affected.   And the fact that this is happening a lot more frequently ...  see a doctor.|`|A6fghDn9aa	I have never heard of any thing like this but I have experience with lots of mental disorders my advice is find a good psychologist and try to explain it the best you can also see a therapist as they can help you allot when dealing with these kind of issues I know I have had some weird things go on in my head also and medication and counseling helped allot|`|B4diva6Qaa	I used to have similar experiences with weird sensations and the weird, random flashbacks to scenes from childhood.  They happened maybe a dozen times between the ages of 13-18.  They haven't happened in decades after that.      In my case they turned out to be harmless, but different medical conditions can produce similar symptoms.  You should get examined by a neurologist to make sure there aren't any problems.

However it also depends on what type of milk you are drinking. If you want muscle then you should try leaner and less fattening milk ! Drinking a glass a day won't dramatically help you gain muscle but it will help you in the long run
ko81Laeraa	haha, actually the only downset of eating that many eggs is you can build up an allergy to them. If  you dont have any allergies though you should be pretty fine.

YIi7scHsaa	Doing heavy weight training, like squats. (from what our football trainer told me), is supposed to release testosterone, which could help you grow faster (provided your body hasn't already stopped growing).    It is entirely possible however that you really are done growing, and won't grow anymore, but most males aren't fully grown until their late teens/early 20s.|`|DKnBzCUpaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.      Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does.

zMD0VeOmaa	The best way I can think of to answer your questions is that depression hits people differently. There is no normal course for depression. Often people with depression will still function in some capacity. After all, their livelihood depends on it. Think about it. If you have a family to support and you're depressed you're still going to go to work no matter what.    It's good that you are coping with your depression in constructive ways(exercising, working, etc). It's also good that you're getting help.    I'm not a mental health professional but based on what you are saying I believe that you have mild to moderate depression. Severe depression by definition is completely debilitating and paralyzing. If you were severely depressed you would want to kill yourself and you would often miss work to stay in bed.    I'm a 25 year old man that has been diagnosed with clinical depression. I'm taking prozac, which seems to help. I would say that I have moderate depression. I've had suicidal thoughts before and depression has impaired my productivity/concentration but I'm still able to function in some capacity. I work full-time as a hospital intern and am finishing a master's degree.     I saw the psychiatrist today to increase the dosage of my prozac from 20mg to 40mg. Meds are not scary if you take them according to your doctor's recommendations and if you let him know about side effects. Your doctor will work with you to find a medicine that works right for you with minimal side effects. Good luck!

It is based on your family genetics!!  Genetics controls everything about your body including shape, size and growth.

AG9msdUDaa	Sounds like a food allergy or allergies:    "Symptoms of food allergies may include rash or hives, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, itchy skin, shortness of breath, chest pain and swelling of the airways to the lungs, depending on the severity. With many of the same symptoms, food intolerances cause nausea, stomach pain, gas, cramps, bloating, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea and headaches."  http://www.uticaod.com/lifestyles/x49779...    I had lots of digestive problems partly from food allergies and partly from screwing up the flora balance in my stomach from using antibiotics. The problem for me was that the allergies came after the flora issue, so it was more because of the imbalance that I couldn't tolerate some food. So for now, you could try what I tried. I eliminated the top 5 food allergens from my diet: wheat gluten, dairy, sugar, nuts and eggs. And for now, if spicy food and caffeine make it worse, avoid those too. While you are doing that, also find a probiotic with as many strains of bacteria as possible, there are some with as many as 9 or even 12. The more complete the better. Start taking it according to the instructions on the bottle. If you do this, you can eventually alleviate the food allergies and therefore, the digestive problems.    I also developed a systemic yeast infection from years of antibiotics and I had to treat this first to be able to get the probiotics to work. I used a yeast cleans kit with diet recommendations.    Can you get an allergy test done? This would give you a good idea of what food to start eliminating if the ones I suggested above don't help. You have to eliminate foods that you are sensitive to for up to three months sometimes before you start to feel better, so you have to be patient.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Well for now, avoid all acidic and spicy foods and drinks. I mean everything. You should be eating totally bland, unflavored plain meat, bread, plain rice, without condiments etc. and drinking water. Also avoid caffeinated beverages. I know it sucks to eat boring food, but, you'll appreciate the relief it gives your stomach.    You might get some temporary relief from over the counter Tagamet in addition to dietary adjustments.|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	Try Prilosec OTC twice a day untill you see him.  This might help.|`|PwnQuNnKaa	let me a chinese to answer your question.  In my opinion, if you want to lighten your symptomthe first thing you should do is eatting less spicy food and caffeine as much as possible.
4KNZ0xefaa	aww don't worry! it is coming soon! i thought i would NEVER get it and i got it today! your next trust me! your just a little small.    i was sooo mad that i didnt have it. but i think its not great at all. cramps are insanee! and pads are annoyingg!|`|ahfzZ665aa	Aunt Flo should be coming. But the discharge could just be hormones. Yes your weight could be the reason. People that are underweight can stop getting their periods..and people that are overweight can stop getting it.Also, a poor diet, and too much exercise can stop it. I got mine when i was 12, and I have a twin sister who didnt get hers till she was 16. I am 24 now and I will tell you whats wrong with periods CRAMPS bad bad cramps and extreme mood swings due to PMS, crying over a stupid commercial, or for some stupid comment someone made. Then there is the nasty blood comming out of you and it makes you feel dirty especially when its hot out, thats why I have banned pads. Trust me once you get it you will understand,.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I didn't get my period until I was 14.  I've hated it ever since, haha.  It'll make you feel womanly until the novelty of blood spewing out your vag wears off.|`|wgm9ADfBaa	dude i feel the same way. sounds like you will be starting soonish. but i think its your weight that is making it come slow|`|QmnKDX7jaa	if you've been having discharge since march then your period should be right around the corner. probably you'll have like a growth spurt and then get it. and i know how you feel about wanting to get it! but when i got mine i started bawling lol.|`|a9iTYbrNaa	I was the same as you. i am thirteen years old and i only just started getting my periods. Your time will come. Trust me. And periods give you cramps and you get PMS. I HATE getting my periods because i get really big mood swings craving period pains and pms. the same will probably happen to you so don't look too forward to getting your period it isnt really that good at all.|`|fc0d0ccbf5397f1031bcdd4e0d86df1aaa	Nothing is wrong with you. It will come before you know it. And trust me, once it comes, you will wish it would go away.

2SSD6BP9aa	Semen is naturally alkaline, which is what gives it its bitter taste and the bleach-like smell.    Eating sweet things and acidic foods will help make it less alkaline, and improve the taste and smell.  Citrus fruits are great (pineapple is supposed to be best), and bananas are supposed to be good too.  Honey and other sweets are also good.  And it helps to drink lots of water.    All those things will help improve the taste and smell.    There are also things to avoid, that can make the taste and smell worse.  Things like red meat, coffee (or anything with caffeine), asparagus, alcohol, tobacco, onions, and garlic.  You may not need to cut all of them out completely, but at least cut down if you are seriously trying to make it taste better.    I found all this info on the web, and I had a guy at my school try it and it really worked!  He tasted much better after.  And on the bad side, there was another guy who tasted really nasty one day, and I found out after that his mom served asparagus with dinner the night before.  So that definitely makes for bad tasting semen!    It might take a day or so for it to filter down, and he might have to ejaculate once in the meantime to get rid of the older bad tasting semen before you get the better tasting stuff.|`|YYsldZcYaa	Blow him with flavored ice cubes in your mouth.|`|QBUypAmAaa	Tell him to cut down on fatty foods or some of the meat. Protein and lipids make ejaculate taste bitter and salty and make a much thicker load. Throwing some more fruits and vegetables into his diet can help change the flavour a bit to become sweeter.|`|gDu53CIjaa	well there are amazing foods in the world to have a test why you r going for ur b/f s e me n then?|`|iASdeAdJaa	i think its either cucumber or celery|`|k3DAUE20aa	PINEAPPLES!|`|qPmPAhiwaa	no joke at all but eat pineapples and avoid iron.    That will make it sweet and tasty|`|YoAELVZTaa	have him eat lots of fruit like pineapple =]|`|yLC5WYRMaa	You will often hear pineapple juice suggested as a way to make semen taste better. But pineapple juice usually comes in can and tastes like it! To avoid metal mouth, eat the real thing. Also, avoid certain foods that can make your semen taste bitter. See below.
kAblN2YTaa	well i think you can rule out pregnancy its difficult to get pregnant when he is inside of you i think it will be almost impossible for that to happen by the time he started fingering you the sperm may have gotten too weak to even travel up there...you're fine|`|I64JOuMKaa	you can't get pregnant unless his ... THING .. went inside your .. THING so dont worry (:
9fLLn2PFaa	Yeah it probably is.  The best thing that worked for me was to take a vitamin E capsule break the outside with a pin and take the oil squeeze it onto the wart and put a badage over it.  repeat it and it will disappear in 4 days.|`|fLdEOmPVaa	I don't think this is a plantar wart. If it was then there really shouldn't be pain, odor, or black spot.  It sounds like it could be a possible infection.  I suggest making an appointment with your doctor to see if you can get it checked out.
LzJMaw2Iaa	Ummm...no.  It's sorta kinda but not really the other way around.  If you've been diagnosed with leukemia you are at an increased risk for developing anemia (low red blood cell count), even more so after you start chemotherapy.  However, if you have been diagnosed with anemia, it will NOT cause you develop leukemia.  My sister has struggled with anemia her entire life but isn't technically being "treated" she just eats foods that are rich in iron.  At the same time, there are OTHER health problems that you might develop as a result of severe or untreated anemia.|`|d2AzNKEFaa	In people, leukemia is the abnormal growth of white cells that crowd out the red cells and the platelets causing anemia -  anemia in itself does not cause leukemia - anemia is a symptom and not a disease process - whoever told you this does not know what they are talking about|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	no you can't get it coz leukemia is acancer of white blood cells and anemia affect the red blood cells also they are very different<br>  if u want to know more about anemia u can read this article on this medical blog <a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/02/what-do-you-know-about-anemia.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|1dbC3SKVaa	yeah just type men breast cancer

I found this link where you can try it for free:    http://32whiteteeth.com/Free-Whitening-K...    I've been using the stuff for about 3 weeks and my teeth are 5 shades whiter. It works really well.    It's free to try, but they charge you after the first teeth whitening kit. But my teeth were noticeably whiter after that first kit. You could just use that and then not re-order anymore. Then you'll have some shiny teeth for free. hehe    Check it out.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	There are dentists that can professionaly whiten your teeth, and there are kiosks for that purpose also.

C0sT0PPyaa	theres no creatine in it so go ahead, and better yet ask the person at the health store too. but its fine.  but if you wanna put on weight you have to up your calories
wtg8vtzBaa	I prefer a female ob/gyn.  When I got my pelvic exam, I was expecting the worst.  But it wasn't painful at all.  They put a thing called a speculum in which stretches the vagina so they can look in it.  It feels weird, but it doesn't hurt much.  Then they stick some tools up there to collect cells to test for cervical cancer.  They also look for irregularities in general.  It's not really that bad.  They don't care whether you shave.  They've seen it all.|`|ahfzZ665aa	Ya I was scared to but i think the best thing is to be clean and shave. It makes you feel better, i even wipe with a wet paper towel before i go in lol. But they put your legs up in these stirrups and tell you to spread eagle and scoot way down to the end of the table. They shine a huge light in there and take an extra large coton swab and swab it. Then they take this thing i have never even seen lol and scrape cells of the inside of your vag. It is a really wierd feeling, but it dosnt hurt..its like mild period cramps. Then they lube up two fingers and stick them up their to feel your cervix, After that your done, unless they give you a breast exam, which they usually do during the appt. Its scary at first...but just look at the celing they usually have pics of like tropical islands and pretend your lying on the beach.|`|8YhITQ7laa	I would prefer a female. Just shave and make sure your clean with clean underwear. Try to relax and dont worry about it|`|94EGAGmUaa	I first went to the ob/gyn when I was 15 (I'm 20 now).  I was pregnant, but I was still very nervous to have a stranger "down there".  I'm sure it was a bit different than your's will be because I was pregnant, but it will still be the same in many ways.  They'll probably just do a pap which is a breeze and talk with you about a few things.  Just make sure you clean yourself up before hand.  I go to a male, he's been my doctor for the whole five years and I feel completely comfortable with him.  If you go to a male he'll bring a nurse in the room when he's examining you, females may do that too, I'm not totally sure.  Just relax and everything will go well.  :)|`|l72nSzIFaa	At 16 you are very young to be having a Pap smear.  Under 25 years old can give false readings due to all the changes going on down there and hormones etc.  You do not need to shave, as long as you are clean they don't care.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	See a Dr...|`|PleCBQeqaa	It's a myth that you cannot sleep when you have a concussion, so you can fall asleep (Especially since, even if you did have a concussion, it would be extremely minor).    Personally, I think that your nausea and headache are psychological because you are worrying about whether or not you had a concussion. A concussion is caused when the brain crashes against the side of the skull very hard after a direct hit to the head.     Normally when you have a concussion, you feel like you are in a dream-like state and lose memory for a short time (and that is for a very minor concussion). Since you were fine and drove home, you definitely do not have one.    Bottom line, you're fine. Sleep away, and you're headache and everything should be gone in the morning =)|`|NWazPeE0aa	I would stay up for about 3 more hours, drink some water and stay comfortable. If you get any worse goto the doctor.|`|JR1MKBKtaa	A concussion is usually from a direct blow to the head, however if you recieved alot of trauma from your fall it is possible that you could have gotten one, try drinking some coffee to stay awake, the caffine will also help with a headache, and check to see if there is a bumb on your head maybe you did hit it slightly. If it persists see a doctor|`|jCQXXPHWaa	Not all the information given here has been correct.  You CAN get a concussion without a direct blow to the head. even a whip like motion of the head and neck can cause a concussion.  I can not exactly say whether you had a concussion this time but symptoms include; headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light sound or smell, feelings of confusion, loss of memory, dizziness.  The list goes on and on.  You can have all or one of these symptoms and still have a concussion.  Some concussions are very minor and some are major.    If you did have one it is ok to sleep.  You can take some ibuprofen for the headache (Avoid asprin), If you are not playing school sports, just take the week off from any physical activity.  If you have gym class or after school sport you should see your primary care physician to give you the ok or give you a note to sit out.
nIsV5iK1aa	you'll figure it out. but it is good that you do it.  Im 19 and never masterbated when i was young.  Now, i cant have an orgasm and i think it is because i didnt do it when i was young.    as for techniques... vibrators are good. just get a little tiny thing and put it on your clit. like the Vibrating Touch by Trojan.  just dont be noisy and your parents wont know!   The shower is always a good time also. especially with a removable shower head!|`|y56BkEcMaa	your a effin pervert|`|XgwGxdb3aa	just do it. your parents dont find out. do it in bed at night.|`|ahfzZ665aa	put some lube or something slippey  on your finger and rub your clit. it might take up to 45 min. the first time but you will start to feel it getting stronger and stronger. then you might reach a plateau where you feel like it s just not gonna happen, keep rubbing on and off,.... like teasing it eventually you will feel it getting stornger and stronger again and then BAM! You'll know when you hit the big O. Every woman is different but i suggest medium to light pressure and you gotta go in a circular motion and make sure your finger is gliding across the clit. If you put to much pressure or dont have enough glide then it will go numb and you wont be sucessful!|`|nOmX8XGUaa	firstly, lol. secondly, let the bath water run over your lower privates.|`|1VZhUxiHaa	lol.

CL5Plgekaa	I think the more serious pain signals a heather flow of blood.  Have you kept a note of blood flows which are heather and when these occur. There could be a pattern. Hope this helps.|`|kVW4WOAXaa	Usually your period starts out slow and in the middle would be your heavier days and towards the end it will be lighter.  Expeirement a little bit.  Good luck!!|`|ivyHOwZUaa	your second and third day are usually your heaviest. Stick with regular tampons and carry extra with you just in case.|`|LU08Ogb7aa	Yup.  Ask your vaj.|`|YiDhb60Paa	i would just wear tthe heay pads
4RpUP4teaa	What the girls did to you was immoral and wrong. I can see that they were controlling you, making you do things. You might have suppressed those memories, consciously or unconsciously and didn't come to terms with the abuse until now. It wouldn't be a bad idea to seek counseling, as the other answerer said. Moving on isn't the answer because it doesn't erase what happened to you. Do what you're comfortable with man. And as for your sex addiction, that may be as a result of the abuse. There's nothing wrong with having sex but if it has caused problems in relationships, a professional could help you reduce your need.|`|iF92Q2f3aa	It sounds like your GF is perhaps the best one to consult about this, since she's in a position to know if memories of the past are disturbing your relationship.    I'm of two minds about therapy in these situations. Sometimes it just seems to open up a whole new vein of "victim-think" which isn't good for anyone; I guess the main reason to do it would be to see if there are some patterns that would lead you back into active sex addiction, which would be harmful to your relationships.     Good luck!|`|EjdOItfEaa	Yes, it was wrong of them to do that but your not the only male I have heard of that went through something like that my husband when he was 11 his baby setter was having sex with him she was 17. It happens, its wrong but it does. It all depends on if you think you need counseling really if it is stoping  you from getting in a long term relationship then I would go to counseling. But again that is up to you no one else. Good Luck
AA10766729	Open up your phone book and look in the front for rape crisis hot line in your area, or call information and get it that way, or contact your local ER.    And YES you should get counseling; it doesn't matter if your assault happened 2 years ago or 20 years ago, you've got unresolved issues you need to address and bring closure to.    I wish you luck.|`|IFd94XDkaa	Yes, yes a million times yes.  It's never to late for counseling.  Just when you think you've successfully pushed it down and forgotten it something will happen and pull it back up again as you've just experienced.  Especially as an EMT you're likely to run into other rape survivors from time to time.      Your experience could help you really help these people if you can work thru your pain to the point that your able to tell them, Hey this happened to me a few years back and I understand how you're feeling.  You could really make them feel that they aren't alone, and help them understand that they aren't to blame.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I would definitely seek counseling I too have been repeatedly assaulted and sometimes there are certain things that will trigger a memory and I will start to cry I have taken some counseling and I am starting to wonder if I will ever get over it mine happen about 5 yrs ago.
crLDgaXYaa	The best time is as soon as you wake up, BEFORE you eat anything.    Your insulin ,(blood sugar) levels are at their highest right when you wake up. Not only that, but your cortisol (muscle destroying) levels are at their lowest at that time as well. The reason why is because this forces you to use the fat off your body for energy instead of the food in your are digesting. The goal is to reach an anabolic state, and reverse catobolism.     Be careful though. You may feel sick at first because your body is not used to ONLY using your body fat for energy. Normally the body uses a combination of body fat, muscle, and food for energy. The amount of muscle your body literally breaks down for energy, is directly linked to the amount of cortisol in your blood at the time.     That is why I would recommend only doing cardio first thing in the morning, then immediately drink a low protein/high carb shake so you have energy for your weight training, and to reduce catabolism caused by the cortisol spike in your blood from working out. Also, studies have shown that the post-workout meal is the most important meal of the day for athletes, and that whey protein and Waximaize, (or any simple sugar) combined with BCAA's, (particularly L-Glutamine) after a workout is the best meal that your body needs for recovery. This is the ONLY time you'll actually want to ingest a simple carb instead of a complex carb. The reason for that is the insulin spike in your bloodstream allows for maximum protein absorption.    The thing is, the harder you work out, the more cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream. It's a total catch 22. So you almost have to reach a certain, pardon the word "Zen", to be able to work out enough to tear muscle so it can be rebuilt, but not work out so hard that is causes your cortisol levels to spike and break down other muscle for energy.    So if you're trying to gain muscle and burn fat, that's the best way to do it. Combine that everyday with a multi-vitamin, at least a gallon of water, a low fat, medium carb, high protein diet, and at least 6 hours of sleep a night, you are guaranteed to gain muscle and lose fat, with minimal exercise needed. I used to weigh 320 pounds. And in a year I was able to lose over 130 pounds! I only work out 3-4 times a week now and I am still burning fat and gaining muscle.    -Jonny|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Really anytime is fine.  It is all about what works for you.  Just be consistent and stick to a healthy lifestyle.  You can do cardio early in the morning and your weights at night.  This way you are revving up your metabolism twice.  As for health going home and doing nothing and eating a box of krispy kreme doughnuts might kill ya.|`|J0N7KFTTaa	early morning is better.|`|LIFbV29raa	Any time.  Just be sure to get a good pre-workout meal about 60-90 minutes before your workout and a post-workout within an hour of your workout.|`|a15475bc6e1e7cdf03ede09bc4724701aa	Early morning and late in the eve is good. Simply look for a cool climate.|`|lY9wHo50aa	do it in the evening after dinner if you are working out to loose weight    work out in the morning if you want energy throughout the day
a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	The leg cramps and pain are a symptom of hypOthyroidism. Not hypeRthyroidism. So you should get back to your doctor and get new blood tests. You probably have iatrogenic hypOthyroidism.    The muscle loss is caused by long term hypeRthyroidism. It will reverse itself if you are no longer hyperthyroid. It takes a long time though.
qu7DSLTqaa	You should have a check up. If you are sexually active, if you've gotten your period (you don't give your age), it should be discussed with your Dr. If you've never gotten your period yet, it may be a sign that your body is getting ready.  Either way, get to a Dr. (local free clinic if your underage and can't or won't get a parent to get you in).
5eGE4AkLaa	Well, dont worry about getting involuntary ones, those are just embarassing and annoying. However, maybe stop masturbating so often. Wait a couple nights and then give it a go. Give yourself enough time to build up a craving for it and you should be "like a rock".|`|eDjdCw48aa	Very Lucky man i always have them
er8hefmSaa	sounds like it....|`|L3NA7Ywnaa	yea sounds like something like that you should take one of those vag bacteria test thingies and if its says you have bad bacteria head on over to the doc

ww9Wx0mwaa	off course,.she is u r friend,.so be worried,.but make sure u try to change her diet,.don't stop trying one day it will work.|`|eMZthQnKaa	Well you never know, she could just eat at home because school lunches are not that good! LOL :)|`|OdLj07Svaa	see ur school councilor about her its really dangerous to not be eatin whn now is when she is grown the most|`|pC4YyCNraa	Yes you should...from personal experience...i had a friend at school who wasn't eating and we took her to the school counselors, it didnt do anything, sooner or later they dont want your help and will keep to themselves.    My friend started obsessing over exercise (walking an hour to school and home everyday etc), lost her eyebrows, looked unattractive, wasnt strong enough to open a big door, shes getting better after treatment but from what your telling me they were the starting signs with my friend so yes be worried and its good your noticing it earlier.    I would suggest mentioning something to her parents, get in there before it gets too serious. try the councelors (that didnt work with us). If you notcie her eating becasue they will give in, make sure when she goes to the bathroom u go with her....and after eating ater 3 hours the food is digested so they cant vomit it up.     It is a hard Situation and i hope everything works out.

Also, the condom is about 97% effective if it's used correctly, so your risk of pregnancy is certainly minimized but you can still get pregnant. You are making a wise choice by using condoms and also protecting yourself with some for of bc. Being a sex/reproductive health educator, I would suggest you wait for a while longer to have sex, but if you are going to anyway, it's good to know you are making responsible choices.
Vux3Gx2saa	Because they are invisitrons|`|o5ms0Gifaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to consume less food and workout more, the issues arise when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are lots of temptations out there don't you think?!

3YfYWpAsaa	1)eat a lot of protein and eat 5-7 big meals a day. STAY AWAY from hot peppers or anything spicy- they tend to increase your metabolism and make you therefore lose weight, since less of the food turns to meat on you.    2) take a multi-vitamin in the morning w/ breakfast, take 2 calcium/vitD pills a day to keep your bones strong (many tall girls have weak bones), drink 2 musclemilk: chocolate protein shakes a day (they taste the best, honestly...), get 9 hours of sleep a night, etc.    3) lift weights, 3 sets of 10... do this routine: (get a gym membership, and do it at a gym. TRUST ME it is ur only hope to really gain 20-30 lbs without having a heart attack from unhealthy foods!)    mon, wed, fri = lower body    squats  leg press  dumbbell lunges  deadlifts  leg extension  leg curl 5 SETS  standing calf raise  sitting calf raise  knee raises on captain's chair  butt kickbacks  leg abduction  leg adduction    tues, thurs, sat= upper body    bench press  upright rows  incline bench  lat pull  overhead press  assisted pull-ups  chest flies  dips (on the U bar)  overhead pull-down  shoulder shrugs  tricep extension  bicep curl  forearm curl/reverse curl  lower back extensions  ==========================    4) If you want to REALLY gain weight quickly, then you can take creatine.  Creatine is naturally created in the body, and has no side effects aside from increased strength, increased water retention in the muscles, and increased IQ.... so it's a good choice if you want to bulk up quickly.    ONLY TAKE CREATINE IF YOU ARE 16 OR OLDER.... not a rule but my suggestion, I wouldnt want a young girl getting involved with supplements..... and take HALF the suggested dosage (since ur a girl) and do it for 2 weeks, then do a week without it, then 2 more weeks with it, etc.  It is a TRAINING SUPPLEMENT and helps you increase your max with weights.|`|EW9Dgbz7aa	whey protein not soy protein  eat organic peanut butter and organic bread pb sandwich everynite b4 u go to bed

AA11176387	this may not be what you want but I want to tell you how to cure your epilepsy or stand an excellent chance of doing so    You can be healed.    Dr John r Christopher, the "father of modern herbology,  who cured the incurables had such success with healing epileptics that they came from not only all over the country but from all over the world    see what he recommends    I would strongly suggest if doing the formulas you make your own tinctures using organic or wildcrafted or fresh picked herbs as these are 7-10 time higher in phytochemicals that cure and prevent disease.  Dr Christopher's heirs who run the school of natural healing do not use organic herbs I heard.  Also teas are better than teas and capsules are not absorbed well so no to them    If you are interested in making any of the formula's I can look them up in his book school of natural healing for you and also can give you the links to the save your life incurables program that the man who learned from Christopher and went far beyond him in curing the very ill and dying incurables recommends for epilepsy.  He also recommends the nerve formula (herbdoc.com) if buying the incurables or most can be made yourself using the formulas he gives for most of the formulas in the manual..these 12 volumes of videos and 700 page manuals originally costs $435 and are out of print and hard to find but I know where you can download them but do not want to publicly post for reasons I will tell you if you want.    But in these videos he shows you how to make your own tinctures etc and I save about 90% making my own.    http://www.herballegacy.com/search.php?z...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Epilepsy.htm...    herbdoc.com recommends the incurables program and nerve formula    also see the film first do know harm with Meryl Streep (many of the actor were former epileptics cured by the ketogenic diet)    also go to the site curezone.com and do a search    I have studied alternative health, herbs and nutrition for 30 years and I think these men are not quacks and the best hope for illnesses and I truly believe in them and have seen the sick get well|`|FjOdTTL0aa	http://www.clinicalconnection.com has virtually every clinical trial that is available in the US listed in their database, just search for clinical trials on that site or go straight to http://www.clinicalconnection.com/clinic... to find epilepsy clinical trials.

AA11301302	Sorry you're going through such a hard time. Are you not eating because you are not hungry, or because you don't want to eat?    If you're never hungry, it may be because you are stressed out and anxious. Maybe the move from your Mother's house was really hard on you and it affected your appetite. Usually under stress and anxiety the first thing to change is the appetite. If you are anxious or depressed, try to talk to your parents about it. If they can't help you, talk to a pastor at a church, a teacher or a counselor. You could also have a health issue, so if you're sure you are not depressed, maybe see a doctor and they can do a checkup to see if anything physical is affecting your appetite.    If you're not eating because you don't want to eat, that's a different story. You may be using food to make you feel better and by avoiding food you feel like you have more control in your life. Most people call that an eating disorder, but don't worry about what it's called, just try to talk to someone you trust, and also, ask God to help you. It's very important that you eat, so if you aren't eating, you should ask for help as soon as you can. I hope you get better! Take care :)|`|eYw4Z6mSaa	You really should eat three meals a day. Fruits and vegetables won't make you fat, if you're worried about that. It's better to eat health foods than none at all.

UpDjoWuVaa	My brother is a drug-addict. It is one of the hardest things to overcome. I know that it is expensive, but rehab will help if you want to stop doing drugs, and it will help you figure out why you want to take drugs and deal with your problems. If you dont have the money I know that some churches are willing to pay for this. If that is not an option you should try to see a psychiatrist. They will help you understand your problems and help you to deal with them so you don't have to numb yourself anymore. I know it is a very difficult road, but it is possible. Take it one step at a time. Seriously, you can do it! You should try to write in a journal everyday. Also, you definitely should go to AA meetings and you can get a sponsor too. Just look it up on the web for which city you are in to find out when and where meetings are. Your sponsor will help you out immensely! You will be able to call him or her whenever you are feeling this way and they will listen. they have been through it before so they are the best people for you to talk to. Hang in there|`|U1WUNCwLaa	do you have anyone to help you get admittance into these places? Google your area (City and town) and Rehab. www.google.com    you could consider visiting a psychiatrist if you think you have the ability to live on your own.  The prices ranges on quality and area, do you have insurance that covers it? call different places for a price range ( or get someone to help you, it will go by faster)    in the mean time you could pick up a sport, such as tennis, or karate, to focus on you physically and improve yourself mentally while at the same time keeping you busy and your mind off of drugs. try to keep yourself busy and stay away from areas and situations that might encourage you to do drugs.    you might also need to be placed on different medication for your bipolar but talk to a professional about that

Alcohol brings down families, causes the most severe impaired driving, and many other things. It also ruined many native and indigenous cultures... This doesn't stop me from drinking, but I'm not an idiot when I drink.    One of the reasons the government won't legalize weed is because they won't be able to control it. How the hell can they tax marijuana? You can grow it anywhere... "weed" is a damn good name for it.    Another reason is because, whether we like to admit it or not, it's a step-up drug. I'm not saying you're going to be hooked on meth, but there's a better chance of you stepping up to a more stronger, potent, and usually more harmful drug if you're smoking dope.    Hope that answered your question. :P|`|8VEEihaqaa	Marijuana is the most misunderstood and demonized drug in the world, especially in the U.S.    I personally smoke, and am open minded and mature enough to not ridicule people for their personal choices, whether it's to smoke or not.

This article has a lot of information:    http://www.emedicinehealth.com/arch_pain...|`|pqnEavSyaa	The most common cause of arch pain is Plantar Fasciitis. Plantar Fasciitis involves inflammation of the Plantar Fascia - the fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. Someone with arch pain usually has inflammation of the tissues within the mid-foot.     Plantar Fasciitis is caused by over-stretching of the Plantar Fascia. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament. These can lead to inflammation, irritation, pain and swelling. Arch pain is more likely to happen when:    -- the feet roll inward too much (over-pronation)    -- walking, standing, or running for long periods of time, especially on hard surfaces    -- excess weight    -- tight Achilles tendons and/or calf muscles    Medical studies on foot pain found that a combination of stretching exercises and wearing a standard, off-the-shelf orthotic shoe insert is the most effective way of dealing with arch pain.  This treatment regime is also very effective for the treatment of heel pain.    An explanation of the importance that proper arch support plays in controlling over-pronation, and some stretching exercises for relief are provided in the links below:
oluzjSgjaa	the best way for some women to reach their climax and have their orgasm, is if you have a partner.   you need time to be together and relaxed.     you lay on bed , he/she  lays beside you and sucks your nipples, and with lube if necessary, plays with clitoris.   if clitoris is too sensitive to touch directly, then around the sides or through its covering hood will feel better.    if your nipples are sucked and clitoris played with for around 20 mins, some times quicker, sometimes longer, you should feel aroused, and experience involuntary hip movements. like you do when having sex .    if stimulation is increased as you are able to take it, and fingers can go into vagina at this stage, you should feel yourself getting very close and moving your hips and vaginal area a lot.   then it should build to your sexual peak, and then your vagina will clench rhythmically 5 or 6 times as you orgasm.   after that you will feel like you need to relax, as you come down from your high.   you may experience a few aftershocks, jerks quivering , toe curling, legs going rigid.   its different every time, and varies in intensity for different woman  and circumstances.   website below may give more info...........|`|z3uUtr33aa	you prolly have to use it longer... until it hurts then stop.|`|M7pYK1rJaa	Awww, thay sucks! I am sorry for you.  I think so much of not orgasming for women is psychological - we have been conditioned to think of sex as "sinful", and to think of ourselves as pure only if we are unsexual (and if we are sexual, to think of that as dirty). Begin by evaluating your attitudes towards your sexuality - do you embrace it as something that is healthy and can be wholesome and beautiful? Do you feel that it's dirty and wrong? A lot of women's orgasmic hang-ups stem from underlying issues like these.   I think the first thing to do is to embrace your sexuality as a beautiful part of you, and something that is fun, wholesome, and loving, not dirty, kinky, or something that has to be done in secret.   If you've already come to the point where you feel comfortable and safe with your body in that way, then I would say that fantasy can be a powerful ally for you. Imagine a loving, passionate situation, and imagine taking yourself out on a great "date."!  Lock your door, play some romantic music, light some candles, have the bed be made up with clean sheets - I mean, really make it nice. Then start with yourself SLOWLY. Let your fantasy take over, and the idea that you're on a loving, passionate self-love (or whoever you want to think about) date. I think this might help. It has helped friends of mine who were in a similar situation, and it has helped me.|`|JgKosPJpaa	i think a good idea would be to have sex.|`|pTDbZWpiaa	if you find an answer to this, i would love to know.  i've been sexually active for 3 years, and done a LOT of different things, by myself and with a partner, and i have NEVER had one.  :(|`|C0LZRO2Laa	sometimes you only get it once a life.

5Qo6OWNzaa	Take a look at www.atkins.com   Its free so dont think this is a scam. I weighed about what you did when I was 15 and spent the next 30 yrs battling weight until Jan 1 2003 when I started Atkins. I lost 50 lbs in 6 months and kept it off. I just started Atkins phase 1 Jan 2nd to trim off another 23 lbs just to see if I can get a 6 pack going for the first time in my life. So far Im 15 lbs down.     If you look over the foods, read the 90 links to studies that say its safe, and the best way to lose weight in the first 12 months and you dont think its right for you..thats cool..    Check heart rate by finding your pulse on your wrist with your first two fingers and tracking your pulse "beats" for 15 seconds and times it by 4, or 30 seconds times 2. You can check by the carotoid artery in your neck too.     A healthy heart rate varies but usually between 50 and 70 at rest. The lower, the better shape you tend to be in .     The weight you should shoot for is 10 lbs loss a month or so until you look in the mirror and you don't have a lot of body fat. The scale can be decieving. I use it as a guage for progress, but I use the mirror to tell me when to stop.

ParFJxnSaa	Those who have been abused, as children, may go on to abuse others, as adults (a higher incidence, is shown, statistically). The medications may be playing a part, as well, since they sometimes result in aberrant behavior. Check yours out at www.rxlist.com & www.drugs.com     So, begin by forgiving yourself for that outburst. Christmas is supposed to be about family, not material things. BTW, things won't make you, or her happy, at least, not for long. You could knit, or make an article of clothing that she indicated she liked the colour, and style, of, or string together some beads in her favourite colour combination. That, a nice card, and possibly some perfume, aromatherapy oil, or incense, or a CD that she doesn't have, by one of her favourites is enough. Realise that the reason you self harm was initially to help cope with the emotional suffering you were experiencing, which would definitely be related to the abuse. Google: "outreach facility; self harm; glasgow; uk" & "self harm; glasgow; uk". A previous answer follows:     View the suggestions on what to do about self harming, in section 16, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and contact them, when you feel the need to self harm/cut. Use one of the alternatives shown, such as snapping a rubber band against your wrist, or holding an ice cube. There is much information, and useful weblinks in the website: far too much to fit in the allowable space here. Seek therapy, to help you address the actual cause of those problems, rather than using an inappropriate method of treating the symptoms, which others have found, doesn't work, in the longer term, and that leaves behind the extra problem of scarring to deal with, then. There is also a selection of treatments for scarring shown. So, are you aware of why you self harm?     The general reasons given are: depression (see section 2, at ezy build; page R first, then, if female; page V, young women's depression, & teen? depression; eventually the rest); if male; male depression; anger (see section 4; page C first), attention seeking, or boredom (suggestions for both are in section 16). Stress is addressed in section 42, at ezy build; view the COMPREHENSIVE POST on page i, first, then the rest of that section. Consider taking up amateur abstract, impressionist, or surrealist art, clay modelling, designing and/or making fashion, or jewellery.     Journalling those thoughts, and feelings, poetry, or story writing are some more options. No-one has to see them, but you may well surprise yourself at how good you become, with experience. Even if not, and you are totally dissatisfied with every single effort, it will still have served its purpose. Use that emotional energy, and allow it expression, through an activity other than self harm. The topic of suicidal thoughts is addressed in section 5.|`|AA10997370	Have you tried COPE? they really helped me when i was going through my problems.

The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|vHwYENVjaa	You seem like a high risk person even right now. You need to either look up hospitals you can check yourself into, or call a hospital or police, tell them you do not feel well and want to voluntarily check yourself into a psychiatric hospital. They will help you.    IT IS SIMPLE, JUST CALL. PLEASE. FOR YOUR FAMILY.    You are devastated. But you are also devastating them. Please see someone. The best way to get help is to start seeing a psychiatrist more regularly, if you aren't already, and also more frequently. If you feel REALLY bad though, like it sounds you do, CHECK YOURSELF IN NOW. Don't chance it.    Do it. Get help. 24/7 help and evaluations where they will better meet your needs.      By the way, my best friend of 9 years killed herself 7 months ago. She killed me with her, if you want to hear the truth. I am seeing both psychiatrist and therapists with little improvement. They say I am doing worse than before I started seeing them..    Please don't do this to your family... you can't even fathom how I feel right now, about losing someone I loved..... don't lead your family down the path where they will question their own life and existence.

You are at a perfectly healthy size and weight. If you want, excersize a little more, and have a little less junk, but dont go on a diet, for two reasons.

So if the date of the last menstrual period was January 1st, January 1st plus nine months is October 1st, plus one week would make a due date of October 8th

deAyKj2Uaa	i work in a pharmacy and we get questions similar to this. sometimes womens cycles are out of wack when their bodies arent getting enough vitamins and minerals.  you can pick up a bottle of multiitamins for about 3-4 dollars. they usually come in bottles of a 200-500 so they last a long time since you only take one per day.  any multivitamin will do, but the 'one-a-day' company makes a 'womens health' formula.  this should help regulate your cycle. :) :)

yDJiiqcsaa	Write a letter to your mother. Writing is better than talking because you can revise it until you've said EXACTLY  what you want to say and you will get it ALL said because she won't be there to interrupt.  Tell her that you're hurting, upset and depressed.  There is no one that will ever love you more selflessly than your mother. Maybe she's tired from working and doesn't "look very closely" at you and your brother/sister because she is hoping that if she doesn't know about problems that there aren't any.  Tell her and ask her to help.  I'm sending (email) you something that has never failed me or my family in times of trouble.|`|hKRmXcyzaa	Christian AND Catholic?

Find someone that's older than you that you trust and let them know how you're feeling.  hope you feel better!    well if you don't have anyone like that to talk to then what about your school counselor? I used to talk to mine and she was very nice. I saw her once a week and she helped me deal with my depression that I kept a secret for 4 years. Don't keep yours a secret you need someone to help you with it.
XDf8xSyyaa	Clear urine is a very bad sign.  Your urine is way too diluted!  Urine ideally should be pale yellow.  Diluting your urine to that extent can cause kidney problems and if you are constantly doing this you could even cause long-term kidney damage, also your sodium levels in your blood can become VERY out of balance which is also damaging.  btw - to all the answers above me, have you actually had any medical training?  Where are you getting your information that clear urine is best???  People shouldn't answer these questions unless they know the facts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|GgB6bLhTaa	It is a good thing.  Generally it means you have been drinking plenty of water.    You can always check with a doctor if you are still concerned.|`|DAimMrGLaa	clear is great :) you're doing the right thing by staying well hydrated.|`|0b7hq71Faa	it's actually supposed to be clear  it means you drink a sufficient amount of water|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Um...the other nurse is correct.  Urine should NEVER be completely clear, it should be pale yellow or yellow.  Drinking too much and causing your urine to be clear can cause major kidney problems as well as an imbalance in your all important electrolytes.  Be sensible, and don't listen to people who know nothing about the human body and the way it works.  By all means be hydrated, but don't over do it and damage yourself.|`|h4oi81ssaa	GOOD|`|iVAqP6P8aa	Very good. It's only bad when it's extremely yellow.

AA10620879	Man's change of life is different from one to the next. They hit a certain  age and they have to still feel like they have it, if only to flaunt it. It is part of their ego.

Discharges are seen in typical cases only, like curdy discharge in Moniliasis or a frothy discharge from Trichomoniasis, not in all cases or not atleast in the initial stage of infection. Infections of vagina result from sexual intercourse but not always. And if you are taking oral contraceptive pills or if you have diabetes or if you recently took some antibiotic course for some other infection then it can be fungal or yeast infection. But you should see a doctor so that he can take a swab specimen of your vagina and send it to lab. That would be the definitive treatment. And dont fully focus on the sexual causes of infection in the vagina. There are a lot many causes of infection in the vagina or of vagianal itching. You gotta see a doctor.Hope it helps.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is quite common for some bleeding to happen a few days after taking Plan B.  Studies are being done with regard to Chinese women, but it does say that there are more frequent pregnancies in this race.  As far as going to pee, it is natural for semen to come out of your vagina if it leaked out of the condom.  It doesn't have anywhere else to go and if the condom broke on the end, semen would have leaked into your vagina.  That doesn't make you more likely to become pregnant, it only takes one sperm to get you pregnant.    good luck..|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Plan B is essentially a super-dose of birth control pills.  Brownish discharge was normal for me when I started BC.  If you're already pregnant it won't work, however you took it so soon I think you're fine.  Maybe take a pregnancy test in a few days to be sure.|`|M7pYK1rJaa	Plan B totally messes with your hormones (although it's better than getting pregnant!) - your symptoms of gas, breakouts, bleeding, etc are completely normal. It may alter your period by making it come early or late. For me, it made me bleed for a couple days early, and then got my period again at the time I was supposed to. It also made me EXHAUSTED for a week or so.     And as far as the condom breakage - yes, that huge rip increases the chance of you being pregnant. And that probably was semen dripping out...so I am glad you took plan B! I think you'll be fine. :)
067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	Creatine keeps the ATP/ADP ratio high at subcellular places where ATP is needed, which ensures that the free energy of ATP remains high and minimizes the loss of adenosine nucleotides, which would cause cellular dysfunction.    Creatine works with ATP to slow muscle "fatigue". They allow you to get that last push in (since the final push's of a lift are what build the muscle, the last push's that you can barely get) which tears the muscle, effectively making yourself a tad stronger.    There are no term side-affects.   Make sure though if you drink it your working out efficiently, as if you take creatine and don't use it, it'll give you a feeling of bloat.|`|b9c65ec66aa315c64475cbf494f861beaa	creatine is good but i suggest u to take it later first be a adult 18  creatine is jus gonna gve u big muscles not muscular.

Women shave theirs so why can't men?|`|83e0d317bb2b739248318df72b7f9d59aa	You can't define someone as 'gay' by their behavior... sexual orientation has absolutely nothing to do with how someone acts (though on occasion, the stereotype can be true. They are called stereotypes for a reason.)    If you dislike hair and shave, go ahead. It shouldn't mean anything to someone who matters, and those who think it defines you probably sorts the world into small boxes.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	thats a stereotype?  no its not.  i dont, but who cares.  i know swimmers probably do.|`|QLZQtUH4aa	I do cause its sometimes too long and gets pulled.

Usually guys dont do that but some do.

My husband hates it but I make him. lol|`|TrauHaubaa	haha. well when it comes time for girls to go down there they wont care. lol just dont go telling everyone. thats what makes it gay.|`|bYoGeKUUaa	please shave its not gay.|`|IoVBib3maa	no hell no..I'm 19 and I've kept it clean since I was 16. Its so much better and so much cleaner. Its not gay dude|`|bFAj5b0Paa	its called manscaping and its not gay thats a stereotype. people who dont like having hair down there do it it just depends on what you like. i know im a girl but if my bf did it i wouldnt think of him as gay at all.|`|Ac9AzRHRaa	oh stfu, dont listen to them    no it is not gay. my boyfriend does it, and so do all his friends  and TRUST ME, it's wayyyy better for me if you know what i mean    if girls can do it, guys should be able to as well  and you shouldn't be worried of what other people think of you  do what you feel comfortable doing|`|DI4a42xoaa	no. i know guys who shave their pubics, and their not gay. however, ive heard it can be very uncomfortable and itchy when it grows back|`|GkqTIGVqaa	I do it and I'm not gay, but I don't shave it all off otherwise it's pokey|`|eOX8U3bAaa	Only if you let your boyfriend do it for you.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Ever considered just trimming short? Perhaps you shaving to retain a pre-teen look for some reason, concern about body changes or something?|`|5b820805b9932bc37844045b822eddbeaa	No, not at all.    I'm a 38 year old man and like to just keep it clean.    I have 3 children and a beautiful wife.    It is not gay to shave and keep it clean my man.|`|lMbYgBtQaa	No not at all. Infact the ladies like it more when you shave.|`|7YWuHIMJaa	To avoid any key  words, let's just say   it is mighty peculiar--IMHO. But why ask us? You have a say in it.|`|qOU9IX7Qaa	It is not gay to shave pubic hair. Some girls prefer shaved pubic hair too. Just go with it if you feel comfortable with it.     For me its hygienic and simply more comfortable.    Some rumors saying people who don't have chest hairs are gay. That is not true at all. Some people are genetically don't have chest hair doesn't mean he is gay.    As long as you know you're straight then you'll be fine. Don't listen to any rumors.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	*sigh* its only gay if you have sexual relations with another guy    I hate how your generation says everything is gay    if you want to tidy your pubes you can still be hetero for christs sake|`|AOnNtUNLaa	no. lyk i make my boyfran shave down there all the time and he isn't gay he fucks me lyk every night....|`|2lC1cJ5haa	GAY|`|X64drAmraa	YEAH!

Hope this helps.|`|9hLEo32Iaa	Its a little bit nasty if you don't.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	it's no gay if that's what u are comfortable with|`|a0f80a327fcf6b505541bf1ca4e04140aa	of course its not gay, its just that guys are supposed to be careless and let it grow out so they would have a big bush just like me haha  but theres definately nothing wrong with it if you shave. be confident and do what you think is right  dont care about what people think because it will never benefit or hurt you if they think something about you. i learned that from experience|`|UuxIJztRaa	no but maybe be u should trim instead
hnPgpulzaa	You should try at least an increase of one per day. Then if you find yourself becoming stronger you can increase in bigger numbers, say 2 a day or 3 or 4 or 5 a day. You'll get up their soon enough. And don't call yourself a fatass. That's horrible.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    Exercises will help to build and tone the Muscles.  A Balanced diet rich in proteins and a good 8hrs sleep will go a long way if you really want to see real change.  Overdoing exercises will cause muscle burn and will do more harm than good.  Take care|`|6Trgwz1yaa	A change in fitness level will occur almost immediately.  But there is a problem.  You must maintain your fitness level for many months before you could see a change in your arm muscles.  The problem is that it is easy to start an exercise program. You must continue it for years in order to see tangible results.    The temptation is to increase the number of push-ups to 50, to 70 to 100 to 200. If you don't see the result you want you may be tempted to increase the number.    But only increase the number if you can continue with it for an indefinite period.    The better option is to select another different exercise, and do some of those. Maybe do these exercises twice a day (morning and evening)    A gradual build up, to a level that you can continue month after month is what is going to make the difference you desire.    Also, exercise in itsely is not the whole answer.    Exercise is an excellent way to get you going on the way to a new lifestyle.    But look for other activities. Riding a bike, walking, swimming. This type of activity is more "pleasing" to you than repetetive exercises.    And the bottom line.  Your bottom will get muscular over time.  It is your motivation that is going to make it happen.  Just take it slowly.|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Push ups will work your triceps, but chin-ups will work your biceps or guns.|`|ej6OdnDBaa	well pushups work your chest, but for arms you can lift dumbells, or do dips
db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	Best to call the Dr back and ask for the specifics.   This could be any number of things.      In general, when the kidneys are not functioning properly, they are not filtering out waste products and the waste is accumulating in the body.  This throws off lots of systems and eventually, people start feeling like crap if they don't seek medical treatment.   This can happen when people have diabetes or high blood pressure and are not managing it well for awhile.         Call the Dr back, he or she will give you all the information and then the specialist will also explain things to you.
ZNKchhXSaa	Lots of guys don't care how big they are.  Many even think big ones are gross.    Keep them natural.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Just to let you know, most women go from a size A at 18 to a size C at 25.  I have no boobs too- 34A. Seriously just wait it out.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	okay, i'm not trying to ridicule you in any way for wanting breast implants, but I just want you to realize something.... breasts arent everything! and surgery doesnt solve anything!    One. If you are already on a lot of medicines then you're really prone to infections... so I wouldnt get any unnecessary sugeries unless you absolutely have to! It could end up devistating.     Two. You should never do anything like that until you're finished growing. You're only 16... so you should defiantly wait until you're in your early 20s before even thinking about this!     Three. You don't have to have a big chest to be beautiful. I'm absolutely flat as can be and I take pride in it. I was given the body I have for a reason and I wouldnt change anything on it unless I had to. And if you don't believe me I was just watching a show on models the other day... some of the richest models in the world are completely flat chested... and I mean... not even an A! Besides you can do a lot more with small breasts. I hear so many people complaining about their larger breasts. I can wear low cut tops and look great, not skanky. I can wear almost any dress I want, and I have less back problems due to them.     But hey, again its your body and it was given to you, so if you want to alter it then go ahead.|`|y7OLG5rIaa	high risk of infections, and if they leak your ******.  other than that just make sure you have a really good doctor, with a clientelle that doesnt mind talking about their experiences with him/her!    they will probably tell you that you need to be 18 at minimum though!
4c01f84c489c38ef4897dc66078e3c31aa	Try to drink lots of water and eat less carbs in one meal. Or you could be just bored.  I know when I'm bored I start to eat even if I'm not hungry.|`|KkFKdRG8aa	I do the same thing and i even eat when im bored. Try to keep yourself busy, dont thinkof food, and you won't want it.|`|as8MVHbxaa	You must be eating the wrong foods that leave you feeling empty and disatisfied. . Try eating more protein, fish and white meat. Drink lots of water.

More information:    http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/faq/pcos.ht...|`|lVNYRSs8aa	yes    definitely see a doctor now|`|FECYVcduaa	depends if she is young then no because she could have a period for a month then like miss a month due to where her period aint regulated yet|`|H8QzKGiPaa	deffinatley go see a doctor.|`|un0C52G8aa	Yes, because the female can become anemic from the loss of blood. Periods that last that long can be a sign of a miscarriage, fibroids, endometriosis, or cancer. Anybody who has a period that lasts that long should see a doctor.
AA10768321	If you normally eat three meals a day, try splitting it up into six smaller meals spaced throughout the day. This should stop you from feeling so full, since you won't be eating so much all at once.    It could also be that you are allergic to one or more of the foods you are eating. Do you feel sick if you just drink milk, without having food to accompany it? It could be that you are lactose intolerant.     If you continue to feel sick after eating, even after changing your eating habits, or if you are concerned now, you should talk to your doctor.|`|AA11086337	Are you lactose intolerant? Or maybe eating too fast/too much at once.|`|9dyPKI9Vaa	cut your portions  its not good to eat big meals  you dont need that much food to give you energy,  eat small portions throughout the day and yes...pace yourself that will help a lot. you get very full on liquids too keep that in mind.  i usually eat my whole plate before i touch my drink.    also what are you eating??|`|oLRXc7kMaa	If you snarf down your food, your stomach and body won't have time to send the full feeling to your head.  Thats why when your starving and eat a meal, you can still feel hungry for a while after until your body starts to realize that it has new fuel.  Maybe try to not eat as much, or give your body time to process the stuff your eating.|`|VG4r3miJaa	Make sure that your rice is fully cooked.  Take the previous advise and eat at a slower pace.  Conscientiously make yourself slow down for a couple of days and see if this helps.  If not try drinking water instead of milk for a few days and see if that helps  Then, based on your results, tweak your plan.|`|75Oa8Ni7aa	I assume you mean white rice.  Switch to brown rice.  Make sure your meat and milk are from animals raised and fed according to their evolution.  Eat your vegetables, at least half of them raw for the enzymes that would be destroyed by heat.  Eat some cultured/fermented foods with each meal.  Make sure you chew your food til it is liquid.  Also "chew" your milk by swishing around in your mouth a bit to mix in some saliva to start digestion.|`|ej6OdnDBaa	well dont eat too fast   pace yourself   when you feel like that again, stop eating until you can eat again
AA11020187	Your doctor is correct. There is no point in running further tests when it is not going to change the fact that you need surgery. Any adnexal mass larger than 2cm should be considered suspicious and it could rupture. It needs to be removed.
EaurpLufaa	Yes, they can.  Artificial gums raise the gum-line in an attempt to fill the voids in between teeth that have been worked upon.  They are not too costly depending on whether or not your insurer approves you.
yhX02yuNaa	You are absolutely right.  What your dad and grandma are telling you is an old wives' tale.  Pay no attention to them.  They're probably just trying to get you to cut your hair.|`|m8ihn5wVaa	You're right that hair outside of the root is indeed dead. I don't know the answer I'm afraid, but I can't think that your hair could possibly rob your body of vitamins and minerals, that seems ridiculous. After all, our cavemen ancestors didn't cut their hair!
BUI2nlUVaa	I'll start with the basics and then move forward.<br>  <br>  Lupus is an auto immune disease where the body's own immune system attacks both good and bad cells.  It cannot distinugish between invaders and normal DNA.  As a result, people with Lupus usually have swollen and painful joints, fatigue, kidney damage, heart, lung, liver and brain involvement.  <br>  <br>  There is no cure for Lupus only treaatment of symptoms.  Plaquenil (an antimalarial drug) is used to help keep the immune system quiet.  Prednisone (a steroid) is used to help reduce swelling and inflammation.  Cellcept (an immunosuppressant) used to lower the immune system.  Cytoxan (a chemotherapy) is used when kidney damage/failure occurs.  More recently Rituxan (a chemotherapy) has been used to help knock the immune system down.<br>  <br>  You do not have 'borderline Lupus' as there is no such thing.  You have either been diagnosed with Lupus or you haven't.  I think what you're doctor is trying to tell you is that you have Lupus but aren't having any severe side effects yet.  Unfortunately, Lupus is a progressive disease.  Most people with Lupus will eventually have some type of progression.  Approximately 80% will have some type of kidney involvement in their lifetime.  This kidney damage can range from very minor to needing a kidney transplant.  People who's Lupus continues to progress have many more serious issues.  <br>  <br>  The important thing is to follow your doctors directions exactly.  If you are not currently on any medications then make sure you eat healthy and exercise regularly (not too strenuous).  Make sure you see  your doctor immediately if you have increased symptoms and have a Lupus flare.  If not treated quickly Lupus flares can get out of hand.   It is very important that you have good communication with all of your doctors.  <br>  <br>  If you ever have any questions about your Lupus please feel free to contact me directly at tandd2@sbcglobal.net<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!
TAtrcCzhaa	Well I live in Massachusetts.  I know most RN's start out at around $30/hr around here.  Im not sure about LPN's, and I think CNA's start around $12-15 an hour.  Thats just from people i know in the field around here.  And nursing school is challenging, I suggest you start out with a few courses and see how it is.  And then when you get to the really hard stuff, just take one or two a semester.  Goodluck!
VB3ZK5f9aa	That sounds too complex a set of problems for you to get a good diagnosis or answer here.  I certainly don't know.<br>  <br>  I am afraid you may get bad answers, which would uselessly increase your anxiety.  I know two days can be a long time, when you're living with uncertainty.  Please try to hold on.  You may have to deal with a period of partial answers and possibilities from the doctors.  Diagnosis can be a lot more difficult than they make it on TV.  (Of course you probably know this.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.
i3TiYBUqaa	Simple, there is a such thing in your body as hgc levels, which is a fancy word for hormones.

fecUjSr1aa	want another advice?<br>  <br>  running out of breath is just natural for you at this stage. like you said, you just started this week. stamina is developed, not achieved in an instant ..<br>  <br>  here's what you can do ... set yourself a route .. say 3 miles .. day 1, start walking .. all 3 miles.<br>  <br>  day 3 or 4 ... walk a distance, jog a distance, then walk a distance and then jog a distance till you finish 3 miles<br>  <br>  the next week, walk a distance, this time jog a bit further distance than the last .. walk again (make walking a time for rest) and run again, further again this time. <br>  <br>  do this routine until you are running / jogging further distances than your walking distances. and before you know it .. hey, you are running the whole 3 miles .. and then when you can do 3 miles non stop .. go for 5 miles .. eh .. do a little walk/jog combo in conquering the 5 miles. pretty soon, you're running the 5<br>  <br>  oh and ah .. have fun doing it (and make sure there are no loose dogs in the neighborhood - know what i mean?)|`|zz6VcUewaa	I used to have that problem and i thought it was asthma and it turned out to be asthma. but now my body is in really good shape so i hardly ever use the inhaler and i run 3.50 miles each day and its no problem, its just gets boring lol. i think it might be that your out of shape but if the problem continues for like 2 weeks you should get checked out by a doctor.|`|ZBQN8viuaa	neither, everyone gets tired when running, it is a really good sign that your lungs start burning, that means your getting stronger and eventually you'll get better and push yourself harder, stick with that burning feeling, if its not burning its to easy and you won't get any better at rnning|`|tIldpr7vaa	ur just outa shape|`|CYCIlR7Eaa	You look quite young so health shoulldn't be a problem but if unsure, get a check up before embarking on a strenuous excersize regime.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb, calculate heart rate by following formula. 220 minus your age gives your maximum heart rate. Aim for 40-60% of your maximum heart rate as your training pulse for 20 mins for a beginner.<br>  <br>  Your probablly working too hard.<br>  Hope this helps|`|JNBxEQgcaa	Try to start slowly, walking, don't rush at first.

imZtZ8Dyaa	Sweetie I can relate. I have had panic attacks for over 20 years. Mine usually come from out of no where, like when I'm watching tv or tring to go to sleep. I wish I knew what to tell you to do to make yours better but I don't. I have learned to talk myself out of them but that has taken me many years to do. I have been on so many different meds I cant even count them all. Nothing ever seemed to work for me. So I started talking to myself when I felt them first coming on. Telling myself that I was ok and no, I wasn't having a heart attack, ya know stuff like that........ But anyway hope you find what works for you and good luck .... I know they suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|F8tQkDPcaa	Hey there, I have been Panic Attacks for more than 12-years now so I understand how you feel.<br>  <br>  There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.<br>  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.<br>  <br>  You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.<br>  <br>  The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.<br>  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.<br>  <br>  Check out this site for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://PanicAwayLindenMethod.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://PanicAwayLindenMethod.blogspot.co...</a>|`|TAtrcCzhaa	Yes it is possible to have panic attacks that come out of no where, thats called Panic Disorder.  They dont last forever, eventually your body has to calm down, there is only so much adrealine in your body to keep you that way for so long.  It sounds like you have a moderate case of agoraphobia.  I've suffered from panic/anxiety for 5 years.  I am almost 100% cured.  One thing I would seriously recommend is some CBT ( Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ) with a therapist and to realize that the Benzo's you are taking carry a very high risk of dependancy.  And believe me, the withdrawl from Benzo's is 10 times worse than any anxiety you have every had, so take it easy with those.  I also used to experience trouble breathing, never could get that calm deep satisfying breath, always trying to yawn and make it happen.  One thing that worked for me was...  If you can, lay down with no pillow.  Put one of your hands on your belly right on top of your diaphram.  And breathe slow and somewhat deep, try not too use your chest to breathe.  Alot of people breathe with their chests and this causes all kinds of problems.  You might be Hyperventilating, I also suggest you look into that.  Again, breathe slow, and no matter how bad you want to try and take a deep deep breath, dont try it.  Just keep going slow and you'll feel better.  Feel free to email me.

GvQHw4Ntaa	The bleeding started because you stopped taking the pills for two days... its VERY important that you take one pill each day, especially since you're sexually active. All you can do is keep taking the pills one every day. Unfortunately, I don't think you'll stop bleeding until you finish the pack of pills, get your period, and start a new pack. It's a huge hassle to bleed for a month, but that's what can happen when you miss pills. Stopping taking the pills will only make the bleeding worse, and besides, you need them as a contraceptive.<br>  <br>  You should read the information that came with your prescription, though.. you will need to take the pills you missed. I believe if you miss two pills, you're supposed to take two pills at a time for two days and then take the rest of the pack as you would normally (unless you're taking a triphasic pill).
g8pRhElsaa	just keep taking your pills. they should at least keep your period light|`|4kuWOZowaa	Birth controls really screws up your period. Let me tell you.

I've also tried everything and nothing works.  Drink plenty of fluids so your body has enough to wash away what's left of your spotting.  And make sure you're back on track with your pills before you start having sex again, or use another form of protection.|`|1aJjFrUCaa	theres no way you can stop it. birth control f***s up your periods majorly. and i've tried everything and nothing works!|`|Qri6T5pqaa	I've known ladies who have bled for months straight until they quit taking BC altogether.

ivyHOwZUaa	Did you talk 2 ur doctor before you stopped taking the meds? The doc has to ween you off the meds. And you probably really need the meds. The first 4 - 6 weeks are very hard cuz it feels as if the drugs aren't working. You have to give it time. <br>  <br>  And, no, you do not have a neurological disease. Wait, maybe that's why you have to take Paxil. You might want to check dat out and start back on it before you really have problems. You were placed on them for a reason.|`|wC0sxhJXaa	Hi, I took zoloft for a while and for a couple weeks i had the same symptoms as you are stating...it does take a while to get used to it..BUT in the end it helped me ALOT ....I would think that you are having withdraw symptoms your body was probly just becoming used to it then you took it away..kinda like when you started your body wasnt used to it...nothing is wrong with you ....no disease just anxiety from the drug thats all...try zoloft and start at very small dose like 25mgs to start use it for 2 weeks then go up 25mgs thats the best way ...good luck|`|Tt6lkGrUaa	I'm actually suppose to take paxil today but don't want to after reading up about it online.

Take about 1gram/ kilogram body weight on days you work out and about half that on days you don't. You have to go quite a bit higher before it becomes a problem.|`|G1OSlub8aa	That amount is fine. Your body can only handle about 20-25 grams of it at a time, but smaller amounts (20 grams) throughout the day is good.|`|73W7ReR9aa	you should have your weight in grams each day 150lbs = 150g protein.<br>  Have it every day and get it from canned fish and hemp powder too.|`|urkNRr5Kaa	The last time I checked this hasn't been proven yet no matter what you may hear.  <br>  <br>  I think it's okay, because consider that most of the protein you eat in one or two scoops won't be digested by your muscles.  It'll be digested and come out in the toilet.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you that I started working out when I was about 17.  I saw decent results, but when I started taking whey protein and creatine, I gained about 45 pounds in about 5 - 6 months.  Some of it was fat but most was muscle.  That happens depending on your metabolism. <br>  <br>  But, if you feel comfortable then take it.  I'm 23 and I'm fine right now.  If it bothers you, then ask a doctor's advice.|`|plcVbZoDaa	Not more than any other food, if your taking too much you'll just waste it out. Excessive protein being hard on organs is a myth but too much of anything isn't good. Don't worry your not having too much, I would suggest casein though since you only need whey really one time of the day IF that.|`|ZBQN8viuaa	i knwo that alot of calcium is to hard, you'll get kidney stones

22ec7debe984f2bd87d099cfdf59f308aa	Have you ever had a dream like this before, if so what happened?  I have dreams when someone is going to die.  It is never the person in the dream and sometimes it takes a couple of weeks for it to happen.  At first I was scared by this, but now I can tell if it's someone in the family or a friend.  I know it sounds weird but it's true.  I can never prepare myself because I don't know who it is but it does take the shock away.    People claim they can tell you what your dreams mean, they can't.  I looked up my dreams before and there were so many different explanations for them, it was silly.|`|AA12258992	Just forget about it.  It was only a dream.|`|3eb891e43419df13cb9124a20ecdd45eaa	If you see that someone is dead in the dream, that means this person gonna live longer.
fypgDK53aa	You can eat anything you choose.. other than the items that you've selected, if that's what your practice is. <br>  <br>  Historically. you would abstain from meat and poultry through the week, and only eat meat on Sunday; or fast until 3pm and only have a light meal in the evening containing little fat, sugar, and no meat. <br>  <br>  If you've only given up bread and junk food except ice cream, eat anything else. I hardly think all you eat normally is bread and junk food, so there is little chance of you starving. <br>  <br>  Pasta, rice, vegetables, salad, fruit, soups.. all good and healthy options, readily available, no bread or junk food. Fish is usually acceptable during Lent, but I don't think you're actually abstaining from meat from what you've said. Eat tuna salad, without the bread, or wrapped in romaine lettuce leaves for something to hold.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) ok im catholic so what should i eat now?<br>  <br>  Rhino frittatas.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) bread, junk food except ice cream...i want to lose weight as well<br>  <br>  Well, if you want to lose weight the first thing I recommend is throwing out the ice cream as well.    If you're on a diet, obviously you want to stick to as much low-calorie food as possible - meaning veggies.  Fish is also good, but you shouldn't eat too much because of mercury levels (two meals a week, I think, is the recommendation, or is it 3?).  Salmon is supposed to be one of the best - because of Omega 3 & 9 - but tuna is also pretty good (if you don't like salmon).  Baked fish is great (especially with lemon juice) and requires no bread.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, stick to healthy stuff like soup, crustless stew, etc.  Soup is really easy to make.  Just chop a few veggies, add some meat and spices...Allrecipes has some really good recipes.<br>  <br>  If your restauranting, stick with no-crouton steak or chicken salads.  Mmmmmmm.<br>  <br>  There's so much great stuff you can eat, I don't know what else to say.  You might be able to justify low cal microwave popcorn as non-junk food (Orville Natural is really good).  Definitely helps if you're addicted to chips.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>

Instead of stuffing a burger excess of cheese use fat free tofu made from soyabean which is very low in cholestrol. The same thing applies for pizzas and hotdogs.    Since u dont have much time for sport make it a point to either jog do some yoga every morning just for half and hour or 45 minutes but u have to do it regularly, only then will u be able to lose a lot of weight in a month's time.    learning yoga is not tough it is just a trick of various positions of the mind and body when combine to give the art of living life.    here is a link to help u........  http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/low-ch...|`|SDuvWi0haa	a diet is the only other solution, but that's not a great idea. exersize would be the best solution, even a walk in the park every morning would do. since you're a buisy mother now, you must be getting lots of exersize right?|`|TAxc74iRaa	Just walk.

I also like the baby carriers that strap on to your shoulders, you can walk around the block with your baby strapped to your chest. Walking is great exercise, and it allows you to socialize with the neighbors as well.     The great thing about exercising with your child, is that your child will learn that this is a normal activity, because you are the baby's role model, and this will foster exercise in your child as he/she grows up into an adult.    An added recommendation, visit your doctor or nutritionist, consult with them on these topics. It is always better to get an expert's advice, rather than doing things based on what the general public thinks you should do.     I'm sure your doctor can recommend a good exercise program and a good diet plan for you.

522978ac03501cb6ea58b23b4876664caa	Although many people suffer from this condition only during the teenage years, pimples can occur throughout adulthood, depending on your hormonal activity, heredity and hygiene.  Instructions        * STEP 1: Resist the urge to attack when these plugged sebaceous glands pop up. In other words, don't pop your pimples'this can cause infections and even scarring.        * STEP 2: Keep in mind that a combination of hormonal activity, a buildup of bacteria and the shedding of dead skin cells causes pimples. Do what you can to prevent a breakout by establishing a skin-care routine appropriate for your skin type.        * STEP 3: Have patience. It could take up to one month for a blemish to disappear completely. The less you poke at it, the better.        * STEP 4: Buy an antibacterial, oil-free concealer that can blend the redness of the pimple into your own skin color. Green shades tend to offset redness the best. (This might not be an option for those who don't wear makeup.)        * STEP 5: Try a facial mud mask. This may shrink a pimple.        * STEP 6: Realize that despite the happy teens in the commercials, 'zit zapping' solutions'medications you apply directly to pimples'don't do much more than dry out the top layer of skin covering the pimples. These medications don't provide a long-term cure.        * STEP 7: If you are going to break the rules by 'extracting the blemish''aesthetician-speak for popping your pimple'wash your hands, then lightly squeeze the top of the pimple with a tissue or cotton swab. Clean the area thoroughly when you're done. If nothing happens, leave the pimple alone until it's ready to pop.        * STEP 8: Apply a benzol peroxide acne medication to the pimple and avoid applying medication to the surrounding area.|`|f7cc91c5d3e379eb48334b472bcb1716aa	How about washing your face once in a while?|`|a65598755d0a65a9d5c63451cbb064e2aa	soap n water|`|AA11559274	umm.. iahev heard that if you put some Vicks Sab on them they will clear your face up with in a week or two.. i know it sounds kinda weird but i do it and it really helps..
2f34b3e62c3ec015941c7cf2d3e79c4caa	Yes there are some instances.. see the links belowl    The proof that it can happen can be found in the existence of identical triplets, given that conjoined triplets are just a single fertilised egg that twice splits but fails to separate properly, and the developing embryo results in a conjoined foetus.    As only one in approximately 100,000 births will result in identical triplets; a far, far smaller number will survive full-term, and given that medical complications are more probable during a pregnancy involving 'higher-order multiples', and that they will probably share vital organs, you can imagine how unlikely it is for conjoined triplets to occur.    However, when the subject of conjoined triplets (or 'triple monsters' as they call them) was addressed in Gould and Pyle's infamous 1896 book Medical Curiosities, they made reference to some unverified cases. They wrote: "Haller and Meckel were of the opinion that no cases of triple monsters worthy of credence are on record, and since their time this has been popular opinion.    Surely none have ever lived. Licetus describes a human monster with two feet and seven heads and as many arms. Bartholinus speaks of a three-headed monster who after birth gave vent to horrible cries and expired. Borellus is quoted as mentioning a human monster formed of three foetuses, but his description proves clearly it was a union of two. Probably the best example of this anomaly that we have was described by Galvagni at Cattania in 1834. This monster had two necks, on one of which was a single head normal in dimensions. On the other neck were two heads. Geoffroy-Saint-Hillaire mentions several cases, and Martin de Pedro publishes a description of a case in Madrid in 1879."    The closest instances we could find were cases where there were conjoined triplets, but they weren't all conjoined at the time of birth, ie, one of them was completely separated from the other two. In 2003, in Argentina, two conjoined triplets were born. However, only two of them were joined at birth and they both died, although their sister lived. There was another similar case in Texas in 1982, also involving three girls, but the same thing happened: only the separate child lived.|`|d8ac7dfd341def99d4987b048d08c1e6aa	It sounds highly unlikely, because the egg doesn't normally split into three identical children. But it could happen, i've just never thought or heard about it. There are some animals that develop three heads, but I've never seen three humans joined together.|`|AA10584907	sure!  its not very likely to happen.|`|AA11662302	Twins aren't too uncommon.

8WVRcFh0aa	Both can work for a surgeon and assist in the operating room.  Both can work in ERs and Urgent Care clinics.  I don't know if there is a difference in how much/what percent of the surgeon's fee is reimbursed for each by insurance companies/Medicare.  (Certainly something a surgeon would think about)  Both can work in any number of specialties - the training is general and what they go into after graduation is pretty open.               One key difference is in the amount of independence in practice.  NPs function with less supervision than PAs  - goes along with the difference of NPs have Master's Degrees.
AA12270248	Oral irrigation refers to the use of a stream of water much like a high pressure fire hose to clean food particles from around the teeth . Plain water ,salt water ,or diluted mouth wash can be used .

Gum irritation is a side effect that is often experienced with any type of peroxide-based at-home teeth whitening system. The gum irritation caused by tray-based systems is typically thought to stem from either trauma caused by the bleaching tray or else a reaction of the person's gums to the whitening gel itself. The best tray-based teeth whitening systems make use of "custom" bleaching trays. These are trays that have been specially been fabricated for the person who will use them. This type of tray design helps to minimize the potential for the common sources of gum irritation.|`|30ed50abf949b3b5d15aeedf592e242daa	do you mean irritation?

Just put it on before you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning wash it off. It takes a little while for it to work, but after the 3rd day of using it you should be golden. No sweat, no stink. And if it still smells a little bit, then just put on a deodorant.

AA11387869	You definitely need to see a doctor--you most likely need antibiotics.

It could be something serious.   A less serious cause for this type of pain could be dental related (and you are getting referred pain), or from TMJ, which is a problem with the tempero-mandibular joint.  People with TMJ often complain of ear pain and headaches.  Because our facial nerve runs very close the the ear canal, we can easily get referred pain.
EcmSTrnxaa	Push-ups are by far the best and most traditional chest exercise.  Try doing three sets of ten every day.  If you can't do a normal push-up yet - place your arms and legs farther apart so your body makes an "X" shape, and do three sets of ten that way.  It should be hard around your 7th rep of each set.  If it starts getting easy, switch to regular push-ups, and when three sets of ten gets easy, do as many sets as you can.  Try working yourself up to doing 50-100 push-ups a day.  The most important advice I can give you is to do lots of cardio.   Run or jog, anything to get your heart rate up and do it for thirty minutes a day.  The cardio is what is going to burn the fat off,  the push-ups will help tone it and diminish the appearance of the "man boobs."

I haven't had any complications at all with my surgery! My health has been very good, and I've lost the weight nice and slow, so my body doesn't look that much out of shape. I've been faithfully taking my vitamins, and my blood work came back excellent! I still think very highly of Dr. Pilkington, and would recommend to anyone thinking of this surgery, to have Dr. Pilkington as his or her surgeon. I'm walking proof, that he is an excellent doctor. I just spoke to another patient of his who told me she had a very good experience with him, and she is in excellent health, as well. He is a very caring doctor. I live in Florida in the winter. I see alot of folks down there because of my job, and I see people from all over the USA and overseas. Since my surgery, I've talked to lots of others that have had the surgery in Florida, and some of them didn't do as well, and I tend to think it's because their doctors werent as competent as mine.

There were recommended by my surgeon and nutritionist.  http:/|`|Wv3IUDalaa	im doing research also. but they dont recommend that you intake food that has no nutritional value. you could have an occasional glass of wine.|`|FXfCT261aa	I dont know but will be watching for answers as I had lap band only 1 month ago.I totally recomend it [so far] as I have lost 20 Kg s.Good luck.|`|FVzURSU5aa	I have had a band since 2001.  Yes, you can drink whatever you like.  It is advisable that you don't eat and drink at the same time as this causes distention of your now small pouch stomach.  You also feel very full if you eat and drink together.  This would be worse with liquids such as beer which is very fizzy.    I have no problem drinking coke or other fizzy drinks.  Everyone is different with their band - one person can tolerate something another can not - it is a matter of experimenting.  As for the band - I cannot recommend it more highly - it is excellent.    Goodluck|`|TOlBxfSMaa	Yes they can, but its really not good for you. If you have one or two once in a while it wouldn't hurt. Beer has calories but worse then that is the carbonation that can strech out your pouch, now you could open a beer and let it go flat to get around that issue, but who wants to drink flat beer.

7Cn6ZKuGaa	When I was in track my coach introduced a "side crunch" used to target your hips. You lay on your side with your legs together scrunched up to about your bellybutton. if your laying on your left side then extend your left arm outward and keep that relaxed on the floor. with your right arm, bring your right hand to your ear and lift up to your side and then come back down. if you go at a steady pace for about 100 crunches or more if you'd like on each side, it will tighten your muscle in that area.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	Only if you have excess fat on them, otherwise you can't change the width of your hip bones.    HTH : )|`|vlSUi2a0aa	Many people ask me how they can slim down. I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").    The Hoodia sold at http://www.2youl.info/free-diet-pills.ph...  is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market. It's pure, has no side effects, and they give you a free sample bottle (there is a $6.95 shipping and handling charge).  Fantastic results have been seen with this particular Hoodia.|`|LhsOoqseaa	nope, your stuck with what u got!
qIuoNztPaa	Did you gain weight after the baby?    I've read that women with heavy periods tend to be heavier and I know that's true for me. I just had 2 babies in a row, ages 18 mos and 4 mos. My periods are still a bit "off" and heavier, but I think it's because I gained so much weight during 2 close pregnancies.  When I was a "gym nut" just 4 years ago, my periods were almost non-existent.  Whenever you drop a lot of body fat, your periods become significantly lighter.  But also, your age (are you in your late 30's?) -- if so, your periods could be becoming more erratic, heavier, etc. as in pre-menopausal.  Pre-menopause can begin as early as your later 30's. Ask your female family members too. If  heavy periods after childbirth is in your family, it could be this.    However, if you ask any female athlete, they'll tell you that their periods are light and sometimes they don't even bleed, meaning skip a month altogether.  The less body fat you have, the less frequently or heavy you'll bleed. It's just a fact of nature with humans.  More body fat = More heavy periods.  Hope this helps.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	You period is fine.  We all go through changes in our periods as the years go on.|`|Hr2C5gzzaa	Yes its normal, your body changes after a birth of a baby.|`|AA12229612	I've never had a baby or been pregnant but my period has changed many times over the years...your body changes as your life does. I wouldn't worry.|`|AA11218898	it is normal to beed too long after child birth some even have thiers as olng as 1 month
4JtMLw9qaa	natural fruits and veggies, but I think that's kinda worldwide....|`|kaCdJamJaa	Ice cubes. And celery and watermelon and apples and lots of other vegetables. But the cubes are the best!|`|lbgzGW5oaa	chicken, veggies, fruit. If you have carbs, stay away from simple carbs like sugar, white bread, or regular potatoe. Instead try to have complex carbs like whole wheat, sweet potatoes, whole grain pasta. Just remeber, if you eat carbs, just go work out so it doesn't turn into fat.|`|49b2b9597618b05d0b440c0defad0d88aa	I think celery and watermelon.   Celery has less calories than it takes to eat it.   So you burn more calories than you gain eating celery.|`|d576a06455a6c8075042bfddfef9db46aa	Seeing how we are American, I'd have to go with the Ball Park Fat Free hot dog. Gotta love em. Top 'em with onions, fat free american cheese singles, mustard and ketchup. Yummm|`|g3OIWfcuaa	I know celery is great for you it is called a negative food, you burn more calories eating it then it contains if that makes any sense. There are a few more foods that are like that I just cant remember them right now :(|`|uCY8pUaGaa	Celery.... you use more calories eating it then it has itself.
aoSY1wKEaa	Hi sweetie. If you're getting the morning after pill from a pharmacist or nurse practitioner you can simply ask them. Don't be embarrassed (because they've heard everything).   If you already have the morning after pill you can always call a Walgreen's or Rite Aid with pharmacist department and speak to one of them. I've spoken with Walgreen's pharmacists over the phone. They were extremely helpful and nice.  Good luck!|`|048aca806c0a3b07f423c7a4acfaa4adaa	I've taken Plan B- it says right on the box it is ok to use it if you are using another type of birth control. Just make sure that you take it within 2 days of the incident. Hope that helps!|`|S10GM4t1aa	i would suggest you keep taking the birth control as prescribed and take the Morning after pill.|`|zxogFzhIaa	Try plan A.|`|RNPq5hHkaa	Get the morning after pill and just keep the Nuvaring in. It won't hurt anything. You can even take the morning after pill if you just started birth control but got a load busted in you anyway
