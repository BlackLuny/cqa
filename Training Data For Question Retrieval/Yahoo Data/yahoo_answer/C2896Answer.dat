AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL em primeiro lugar tem a ver com a 'Camada de Oz?nio', existente entre o Planeta Terra e o Sol , portanto, em nosso sistema solar desta galxia (de 24 setores).    Houve um MOMENTO no passado em que esta CAMADA foi ROMPIDA drsticamente.  Os primeiros estudos nesta rea s?o do ltimo sculo, onde se pode COMPROVAR que o dito BURACO na camada de oz?nio diminuiu nos ltimos 50 anos!    Exatamente nos ltimos 50 anos se deu o processo maior de industrializa??o no planeta, PORTANTO n?o foram os HUMANOS os responsveis por este inicial ROMPIMENTO da Camada de Oz?nio. Ser que estes pseudos cientistas n?o percebem isto?    Ah, percebem sim, mas os que mais emitem opini?es na mdia s?o os 'MERCADORES DO CAOS' e claro, organizando um CENRIO para seus objetivos, que podem n?o ser claros para a popula??o, porm, aos que n?o est?o dormindo em ber?o esplndido, por certo SABEM muito bem...  E se um dia, estes mesmos 'Mercadores do Caos' vierem apresentar outras quest?es como 'o Planeta X' ou ajuda de extraterrestres, VOCS j sabem ent?o o por que destes Cenrios montados e n?o entrem nesta, por favor! (Afinal, podem de fora apresentarem solu??es ao que ELES mesmo no passado FIZERAM, nos traindo e desejando novamente repetir o FEITO (e depois chamam de Big Bang como algo ocorrido no Universo todo!... Ah, meu planeta!).  E aos menos avisados, que teria aqui sido efeito de um meteoro (De Yucat?n? Jamais...). Um dia saber?o...

O nosso MEIO AMBIENTE tem sofrido muitas AGRESS?ES pela industrializa??o e o mau uso do solo, das florestas e do len?ol fretico.    - Descontrole no desmatamento, n?o agora apenas do Brasil, mas do PASSADO de todos os pases que acabaram com suas florestas naturais.  Sim, louvamos ao menos o REFLORESTAMENTO por todos estes pases e o aumento da CONSCIENTIZA??O de todos.    - Em nosso Brasil, muita coisa divulgada carece de Estudos importantes, n?o apenas nas reas que j devastamos, mas tambm na nossa parte da AMAZ?NIA INTERNACIONAL (Brasil, Venezuela, Bolvia, Colombia, Equador, Guianas etc...).  Especialmente a que nos pertence, a Amaz?nia Legal.    - O destino dos materiais n?o reciclados que contaminam o meio ambiente, especialmente a GUA, seja de nvel ou de len?ol fretico.    - Os poluentes 'invisveis' como os GASES em nossa atmosfera como resduos das indstrias, queimadas, alm dos gs carb?nico (de animais e humanos somados).

Os primeiros estudos sobre a deple??o do oz?nio na Antrtica mostraram duas caractersticas principais. A primeira indicava grandes perdas no oz?nio estratosfrico observadas, durante a primavera, entre os anos 1974 e 1985; a segunda, mostrou compara??es com medidas realizadas entre os anos 1950 e 1960, que indicavam uma atenua??o mdia de 300 para 200 unidades Dobson (DU) de oz?nio.     Vrias teorias foram propostas para explicar as causas desse fen?meno. Entre as principais est?o: 1.) a Teoria Dinamica (Stolarski, 1988), propondo que a circula??o atmosfrica sobre a Antrtida mudou de tal modo que o ar da troposfera, onde h baixa concentra??o de oz?nio,  levado para a baixa estratosfera e, conseqentemente, redu??es dos nveis de oz?nio s?o observadas; 2.) a Teoria do xido de Nitrognio (Callis e Natarajan, 1986) que se refere ao aumento de NOx produzido pelos efeitos fotoqumicos aps um perodo crtico de aparecimento de manchas solares (1979). A presen?a excessiva de NOx seria o responsvel pela destrui??o excessiva de oz?nio.|`|EMlLMOOvaa	OZONO seria oq ?    Oh!! beb !!

Giving aid to countries bordering the Amazon to reduce the amount of clearing they need to do for financial gain. Some ex situ conservation is occuring. There are numerous conservation groups operating within the Amazon, conserving animals, wildlife and culture - my friends have travelled there and participated in such groups. Then there are protests.    What we could do further is come up ecologically sustainable forest management in the Amazon (make it economically viable for these countries to keep and conserve forests). The Brazlian government has previously asked for the World Bank and foreign countries to cancel the debt in exchange for protection of the Amazon (but the developed countries wanted their money back) ...

Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. Oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. Noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. Mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neuralgic symptoms. Lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. Chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth defects. And this is just a few examples of what it can do to us humans, just imagine what it is doing to the rest of the living ecosystems. It can cause respiratory problems in animals, disturbs its population. Bird populations have been drastecly changed, bears that rely on fish diets can become contaminated. Mysterious mutations in frogs and other small animals have been detected. Polution and is the primary reason forhabitat destruction  and extinctions of animal populations.

You will obviously not be able to do a major in a junior college but you can certainly take all your general ed so that once you transfer to a university you will not have to pay twice as much to take them.  Take as many science classes as you can, and see which of these can be transferred to a university for credit.  As a bio or zoo major you will have to take chemistry, physics, statistics, physiology, etc.  The more of these you can take while in junior college the better.  Get a good handle on these subjects as it will be easier for you to get though your classes once you are an undergrad. Also, try and get some hands on experience while still in school..look into volunteer work or internships at zoos, wildlife rehabs/sanctuaries, etc. Also if you have a local Resource Conservation District..look into volunteering with them.|`|buHzPMHZaa	A junior college is only going to be good for a small job or as preparation for a full university degree. Land trusts are the best places to start for most conservation jobs, but combining zoology and conservation is pretty specialized. A degree in wildlife ecology, management or zoology is a good place to start. Jobs in zoos are a little rare, but a good place to start is as a volunteer at any place that works with wildlife. Science museums, aquaria, animal shelters and rescue centers, and zoos are always looking for volunteers. This is a good place to learn about the field and get a handle on what it is you want to do. You're going to need that degree to get a job that pays a living wage, though, so be prepared.
buHzPMHZaa	Sure! The reason that New England can't have any oil refineries is because our air predominately flows over the Ohio Valley before it comes to us, and picks up pollution from the power plants and industry there. Our Asthma rates are too high as it is, so no oil refining takes place, courtesy of the EPA. We can't handle any more dirty air.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	yeah|`|buU2w7dTaa	Yes.

1AZIDkNlaa	No.  If you can figure out what power supply your computer has, you can figure out the maximum wattage it can use.  Monitors and tvs should have some kind of label indicating how much electricity they use.    You can get a kill-a-watt meter if you want to find out for sure how much electricity an appliance is using at a given time.  (See the attached link.)    For reference:    My laptop: 65 watts (maximum)  My room mate's tv: 69 watts  My Mac Mini: 110 watts (maximum) + 40 watts for my lcd monitor  Radio Shack's Blackbird gaming computer: 900 watts (maximum) + monitor    By the way, turning computers on and off frequently doesn't hurt them.  You just want to make sure you shut it down properly each time (going to Start | Shut Down, rather than just hitting the off button).|`|yAed3TZYaa	That depends on how much power they both use up. Find  out those numbers and you'll have your answer - a netbook uses less power than a gaming desktop, for example. Also, some people say that it's bad for computers to be turned on and off frequently, though I do not know whether that is true.|`|MI0MIAfaaa	It depends...  Different types of tvs and computers use different amounts of electricity.    Laptops use less than Desktops,  LCD monitors and TVs use less than CRT monitors and TVs,
qA2TJiEqaa	It depends on how many volts the motor is.electric motors are measured in volts.So if you have a 24 volt motor you will need enough electric to push 24 volts constantly for the amount of time it will take your electric car,golf cart to go 100 miles.so you will need very long life batteries or batteries to switch out in your trip.not likely you will find batteries that will last a 100 mile trip.                             The bulb is what changes volts to watts.120 volts runs 60 watt, 80 ,15 watt and so on. speakers  are measured by watts to.  light bulbs break electricity down by amps.speakers break electricity down by ohms|`|NcN633LWaa	Alex,    There are a number of books written about converting gasoline or diesel cars/trucks to all electric drive. I suggest you look up the Electric Automobile Asociation...www.eaaev.org...the books will be available there. They contain the formulas to calculate the range (miles) that an "X" weight automobile with a "Y" amp hour battery pack can travel on level ground. Hills reduce range and declines increase it. Cars are already being converted that easily exceed 100 mile range. I was at the Phoenix EAA meeting this Saturday when a newly converted car (a Miata) was driven to Phoenix from Flagstaff...over 137 miles. There was still additional battery capacity left. The older electric cars had lead acid batteries...they would only have about 30 miles range. Then Nickel Metal Hydride which for the same weight car and same weight battery pack would be good for about 60 to 70 miles. And now advanced Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate batteries are available. There are several different Lithium Ion chemistries...Lithium Ion Cobalt was the chemistry that caught fire in laptops. But the Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate battery is not so flamable. None of them are as flammable as gasoline, and there are many people badly burned from automobile accident gasoline fires every year. Also, current advanced battery installations include electronic monitoring of every cell, as a means to prolong battery life by more precise charging and selectively drawing current. There is evidence that an advanced battery pack can be recharged about 1500 times and more. 1500 x 100 is 150,000 miles. So even a $15,000 cost battery pack is only $0.10/mile.|`|027e4b603b33c0e5ccaa877273bf5a75aa	You are confusing a lot of different things and need a basic understanding of Electricity..     Volts is the measure of electric Potential (higher voltage more potential)  and Amps is a measure of "flow"  of electric current    Watts is the measure of power/energy in electricity    Watts = amps x voltage.     Kilo watt hours (watts x time) is a a measure of power used in an hour and KWH measurements is actually  how your electricity company charges you for the electricity you use.        So a system with much higher voltage will need less amperage to achieve the same wattage.          For example .. most cars run on 12 volt systems with 12 volt batteries.  However, I believe a Toyota Prius has a 300 volt system (I also think some hybrids run on a 40 volt system)     Batteries are usually rated for amperage at the operating voltage and have limited power (KWH).         So how do You calculate how much electrical energy is needed to travel 100 miles.. it depends on the power needed, resistance and a whole very complex situation... a lot of things will affect the calculations.. (weight of vehicle, whether you are operating on flat surface or on hills, etc. )      I am looking right now at an sales brochure for a a 45 watt solar panel kit (for $200) that will be able to put out current at 3, 6, 9, or 12 volts..|`|sHc155B4aa	I believe you would not be be able to express how much energy something uses in volts. The correct measurements would be watts, and there isn't a way to convert watts to volts. and yes, some cars can run purely on electricity.
bKwQyCEHaa	The largest volcano on earth is Mauna Loa on Hawai'i Big Island. It is a massive shieldvolcano constructed by countless lava flows. When measured from the base to the top, the pile of lavas measures more than 17,000 m (56,000 ft)!       When measured from the sea floor, Mauna Loa's height is still more than 9,000 m, thus it is also the highest mountain on earth. Mauna Loa in fact is so heavy, that its weight has bent the oceanic crust under the volcano several kilometers downwards into the mantle.      Mauna Loa is one of the Earth's most active volcanoes, with 33 well-documented eruptions in historic times since 1843. Its last eruption was in 1984 and since 2004, Mauna Loa is showing increasing signs of a possible awakening in a not-too-distant future      Hope this helps|`|feVEpsWYaa	Mauna Loa located on Hawaii's Big Island.

If it is raining now, there is a better than average chance that it will rain 1 hour from now.  The problem is extending the prediction beyond the correlation period, which is certainly much less than the 30 years needed for a climate trend.|`|t1zlbOURaa	They're better climate predictors than Al Gore.

badeb4e509edbe31e00e0cf98a9ad4f3aa	Someone who can say "Green is the new Red" is obviously too young to really appreciate what that statement means.

But Reagan buried it again, with Star Wars, And defeating the Russian Bear.  (well, actually, we gave lots of arms to terrorists in Afghanistan, who did the job,  and at the same time, really learned, with our help, how to be "good terrorists".)    then came the 90s, with it's economic boom, and several years of debt reduction.  nothing at all to scare the public.  AH HAH,  let's go resurrect that Global Warming Hoax.  it gained some momentum, but it was a bit shaky.  then came the war in Iraq.  and the need for distraction - how the debt was growing, how many soldiers were being killed, but far worse, how many were being maimed, and disabled for life.  that's when the Hoax really took off.  people just flocked to the cause, in an all out effort to hide from reality.     and that's where we are today -- cowering in our "climate corner", and ignoring the tremendous success being experienced in the middle east.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	It's the latest pretext for an agenda that long predates it.

This earth has been here for hundreds of billions of years, right?  How long has humans been on this earth?  Maybe a couple hundred thousand years, right?  500 million years ago, carbon dioxide levels (which they claim is the main cause of global warming) were thirteen times higher then it is right now.  The average temperature only increased a little over 1 degree F in the last 100 years.  The ice shelf is melting because it is summer there.  All the ice levels in the north are the same as they were in 1979.  There is something out there that is even more disturbing.  There is a United Nations Population Fund that Pres Obama just signed to support with 400 million dollars of our tax money.  This UN project wants to control the world's population through contraceptives and abortions.  It is believed that if population is controlled that the earth will be better off.  Do you want to know when this organization was started?  Wanna guess?  Try 1968!!  How is that for a little proof about what you have been hearing?  Really scary stuff people.  So it is all a hoax designed by countries and their governments to find new and inventive ways of regulating and controlling their people.  Look at us!?  Look how many billions and billions of tax payer dollars are used for this instead of schools, bridges, highways, and drilling of new oil?  There is something really not right here.  This is a natural cycle our earth goes through every 11,500 years and it is time people wake up and see the truth before it is too late.|`|Nfw68G6raa	You GO!

2Ypig4jBaa	Off hand I can think of three separate types of "Flat Irons".    The first is the type my grandmother used to iron clothes with.  It was heated on a metal plate on top of a wood burning stove. Then used to press the wrinkles out of the cloths.  With this the solar energy stored in wood was released by the chemical reaction of the rapid oxidation of the carbon compounds as heat.  The heat was transferred from the flame to the pad that the iron would rest upon.  The heat passed from one piece of metal to the other and then from the iron to the cloths.  Steam formed out of the water in the cloths, the evaporation cooled the flat iron.    The second "Flat Iron" is what is used to straighten hair.    These are most commonly heated with electricity.   Electrical energy is transformed into heat.  Hair irons can also be heated with butane.  Stored chemical energy is transformed into heat.    The thrid "Flat Iron" that comes to mind is a "Flat Iron" steak.  Solar to photosynthesis, to grass growth, to cow, to digest, to muscle growth, to dinner plate.  Basically solar to chemical energy.

EpkQJnJOaa	Plastic is typed from 1-7. 1 being the easiest to recycle going up to 7 the most difficult to recycle. Curbside recycling only accept 1 and 2 because they are the only materials they are equipped to process.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	1 is PETE (as in soda bottles) and  2 is HDPE, as in milk jugs. They can be recycled as insulating fibres, garbage cans, or motor oil bottles. Other plastics can be recycled as plastic lumber but the demand for it is insufficient to make it economically feasible to recycle the plastics from 3-7 and make a profit.
oEYrC1Wsaa	Mate do not let this dude wind you up.  You will be the one in trouble for throwing the 1st punch (which is exactly what he is trying get you to do).       Can you have someone film how he acts around you a couple of times, then take it to the principal?   If you have evidence of this idiot's behavior, warn the principal you don't know how much more of it you can take.       Also show it to your parents just in case 1 day you do lose your cool & pop him, you will have evidence of self-defence.  Knowing he is a coward, he would more than likely bring charges against you - it is so not worth it.    Take care, stand tall, ignore him & don't lower yourself to his level.   Cheers.|`|nbGf6udUaa	punch that punk..you will always regret it if you dont. plus that sort of thing makes the girls cream.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	you should tell your story to the principal or teachers first, so they`ll know the scenario when things get beyond control, or you may embarrass him,tell him that he`s only borrowing toughness from his friends.  when he`s intimidated, let him strike first then do your stuff.|`|8tQ8JLO5aa	Discuss the situation with your parents and some of the teachers at school who you respect.
