20090202165921AAoJGAe	Pets;Cats	Kitten acing strange after visit to the vet?	I took my 9 mo. old kitten to the vet today for vaccines and the dewormer Profender. He was calm and happy and didn't even cry when he got his shots. But when we got home he ran under my bed and wouldn't come out. He is not eating food or treats, which is extremely strange for him. After he came out he still refuses to play or do anything (he always plays). I figured it was stress but it has been hours since and it's too late to call and ask them. Do your cats act strange from medicine or visits to the vet?

He always gets in fights with other cats I think cause sometimes he comes home with a scratch or two.      Right now he has a BIG bump under his right eye. It kinda looks like he got hit in the face. I don't know if its an infection in his mouth or just a scratch that got infected and has ALOT of Puss in it?      Is there a vet on here or can someone help me please?!      I wish I had the money to have him checked out but I don't =[       http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v511/J...        http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v511/J... 
20090202170226AAr8nQw	Pets;Dogs	How to teach a dog to play with toys?	I recently (1 month) adopted an older (7+ years) dalmatian/Australian cattle dog mix. He is a great dog, but rather calm, reserved, and submissive. I've not had trouble crate training, house training, or basic leash training him. (Honestly it seem more like a review for him.)        I'm trying to teach him to play, but he is not interested in toys.  The only toy that ever interests him are a hollow toy with food.  Even then it's only interesting when it's something like chicken.  Fetching or the take it command seem out of the question.  At the dog park he'll chase the dogs chasing balls, but has no interest in the balls.  Attempting any physical play results in him standing still looking away, or retreating into his crate.  He does sometimes play with other dogs at the dog park, but is bad at initiating the play.  (Generally he'll just come up to the dog, and stand there instead of doing a play bow or the like.)       PS- Squeaky toys seem to distress him as he doesn't seem to realize the sound comes from the toy.  (He hears well, but it seems like he can't always tell where a sound comes from.)  If you keep going he'll franticly look around, and even try to dig at the carpet.

Low and behold what do I find;  http://dakotawinds.homestead.com/Puppies...       No only do they breed Mini and  'Nehi' Saints they also breed Comfort Retrievers (GoldenxCocker Spaneil mix), Labbes or Toy Labebes (LabxBeagle mix) and the Dakota Shepherd (English Shepherds, Australian Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels, and Poodles)      I am beyond disgusted and their justifications, including hybrid vigor are insane      What really makes it worse is that their adult kids have join in  http://windswept.homestead.com/puppies.h...       Windswept Kennels offers      -Toy Labbes   - Copicas (Corgis, Cockers, & Mini Poodles)   - Ori Peis (pugs and shar peis)   - Cuddles (1/2 Beagle, 1/4 Pug, and 1/4 Pekinese)   - Puggles (Pug , Beagle)   And last but not least for the basset lover the Hush Basset and the Minute Hound - other than basset no mention of what the other breed(s) are.

He didnt use any official tools or anything, and When I look into her eyes they reflect "light blue" when she isnt under a light her eyes look perfect no cloudiness or distortion.      He didnt do any official test and im wondering if I should just get a second opinion from another vet who can actually perform an eye test instead of just looking in one eye in a dimmly lit vet office.

20090202142741AAF1xb2	Pets;Fish	I think my betta fish is sick, but i don't know with what. what do I do?	I have had a beta fish for a little over a year, and he (the girl who gave it to me told me it was a male) has an unusual bump or something on his right side. He swims kind of erratically, and it looks like he might be losing color by his chin and face. He is breathing very quickly and it looks like it's with quite a bit of difficulty. I looked this up, but I'm not sure if he really is sick or not. I just recently left for a few weeks and the woman staying here overfed him. I'm not sure if this is just fat from too much food or if he really is sick. I think the food i had for him was bad though, and I just bought some new food (freeze-dried bloodworms) today. He ate a bit, and then I was watching and noticed his strange behavior. It looks like he has stopped swimming so strangely for now, but we'll see...      If anyone knows what to do please help!!

They hatched weird, some hatched earlier than others, and they hatched basically every other day.      Well, today we tried hand feeding. They rejected it, and we couldn't get them to eat it. I was wondering how to get never-before-fed cockatiel chicks from a syringe?            ANd there is a runt in this clutch. He is the youngest and the smallest, and he doesn't get fed as much :( So we are trying to feed him to get him to a healthy weight. We think the parents don't feed him enough because he is the smallest, and the quietest of them.      How do I get them to feed from a syringe? This is the youngest I ever fed at. And how do I keep the smallest baby healthy?

Anyway, I resent his dog to the point where I want to just kill it! (I really love animals also) This dog though, it drives me nuts! I hate when my husband feeds it, I hate when he sleeps next to it, I hate when he says he misses his dog and I hate when he calls his dog a puppy because the dog's 6 freakin' years old!!! I have no idea why I hate this dog so much! I mean, maybe it's jealousy, but I don't know why it would be that. Maybe it's just my pregnancy hormones, you think? I am 9 months pregnant, so maybe that could be helping with all the hatred towards the dog.      Here's the stupid dog    http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...

The mother is so skinny that you can see her bones and the bones in her tail. I personally want one of the puppies so I was thinking about getting one on the 19th since by then they should be a month old. The mother really needs to be relieved of some of the puppies before she dies trying to take care of them. My auntie doesn't know squat about dogs and therefor I also want to take the mother dog and her West highland White Terrier. The mother dog actually belongs to her neighbor's friend but he is locked up in jail and has 5 more years to do.The neighbor is the one who is really suppose to be watching the mother dog but he doesn't care about her. I want to take one of the puppies, the mother dog and the westie but I'm not sure how to approach the situation. Should I take the dogs? What would you do in this situation? Also since the mother dog belongs to a totally different person and is unaware of her condition would it be wrong to take her? Sorry that it's so long

20090202175223AAFS8oG	Pets;Horses	Tips on selling a horse???!!!?	I have a ten year old sorrel paint mare that I need to sell.  I have too many horses and she is the most likely to sell the best and be suitable for all different levels of riders.  She is between 15 and 16 hands tall, has a very wide, white blaze on her face, 2 very small white socks, and a medium-sized belly spot on each side.  She is mainly used for trail riding and is very quiet and calm.  She has a very sensitive mouth and was kicked in the jaw when she was young- we tend to use a something bitless with her (sometimes a hackamore, sometimes a halter with a lead rope).  She is kid safe, but could be brought to the next level very easily.  Sometimes you have to kick on her to get her to lope, but has a very slow lope.  Her trot is slightly bumpy, but not too bad.  She is a decent keeper and never gets too skinny.  Her only vice is that she weaves, but it does not affect her when she rides.  She only weaves when she is in the barn.  Middle of the pecking order, nice hooves, stands to be saddled, shoed, loaded, groomed, etc.  Moderately easy to catch out of the pasture.  Neck reins and responds to leg cues.  Wanting 1500 for her but how much is she really worth?  I use her for trail riding and cattle RIDES WESTERN.  Also, I was thinking of posting a few internet ads, any good websites with free photo ads or any tips?  Was also going to make a video.  What should I do for it?  (just walk trot lope or what?)  Also, what  should I take for pictures?      -----Thanks!

As she opened the door, she let go of their leases so they could hop in the car.At the same time, the neighbor's Jack Russell came running at them barking. One of my aunts dogs (a 10 year old Chow/Lab mix who is waaay more Chow like in temperament that Lab like, ie she's very "watchful" and always on alert to her surroundings like a guard dog) jumped out of the car before my aunt could close the door and grabbed a hold of the Jack Russell and killed it.       The people who own the Jack Russell ALWAYS let their dogs run loose in the street and they just really don't take care of their dogs in general.They had 3 dogs: the Jack Russell, a Yorkie, and another small mixed breed dog, and pretty much at any given time of the day, one of their dogs is running around in the street, barking and nipping at people.      Also, a while back they had let their Yorkie out into the street and it found a way into my aunt's backyard and the Chow mix got a hold of it and mauled it. The Yorkie lived but it had like $3000 in vet bills. They never reported it because technically it happened on my aunt's property so it was their fault.      This time the SPCA is saying that my aunt is at fault because her dog did the killing and she didn't have a hold of he leash when it happened.       I think that's wrong and the neighbor's should be at fault, or it should be 50/50. What do you think?

20090202183701AAkweKo	Pets;Fish	Is it ok if my aquarium is not PERFECTLY level?	Hi. I have a 10 gallon aquarium that has been established for a couple of months. My tank is on a stand built for it's size, but it has an open bottom. It looks like this stand:       http://www.flyriverturtle.com/aquarium%2...       I recently noticed that my tank is a little bit off-level. I used a level to see how level my tank was, and it was off by 5mm. Is this ok? My 20 gallon has been set up for 2 years and it's off by 5mm as well. I have had no leaks yet, but I'm worried that, since I have an open bottom stand for my 10 gallon, the un-levelness might collapse the tank.      What do I do!? Is it ok if I leave it? If it's not, how can I fix it easily?      Oh yeah! And both my tanks are on a carpet.      I will choose best answer and any other answers will be appreciated!   Thanks!

Now my dog is 12, and recently peed in my living room. My whole family loves the dog, with the exception of my dad. One time, when my dog peed in the house, my dad took him away to this boarding place. We couldn't find him. My parents got in a huge fight. Now my dad said he's going to send him away for good. I'm going to have my dog sleep in my room tonight, and my mom is bringing him with her tomorrow when she goes out so my dad can't take him. What should we do, long term?

20090202184233AAsSpiT	Pets;Horses	Question about mules?	Actually, two questions.      Number 1... Is there a specific breed of horse that people usually use to get a mule? Or are there a lot of different breeds being used? Wouldn't mules be as almost as varied as horses are? Why aren't mules known by the horse breed they're crossed with?      Number 2... Gaited mules. They have to use a gaited breed to make a gaited mule, correct? What breed do they usually use? And why doesn't the mule get the donkey's gait, if breeding a gaited horse to a non-gaited horse only produces a gaited horse 25% of the time?      Okay, sorry.... That was a lot of questions : /

20090202122826AAuGRtH	Pets;Cats	How to know if your cat loves you?	I've had my cat, Rocky for about 6 years. He was eight months old when we got him from a rescue centre after he was badly treated by some horrible old man.    He's one of my best friends and I love him like my own flesh and blood. The thing is sometimes I wonder if he reciprocates my feelings.      He-   Comes to me when I get in from school.      Sits on my chest when I'm in bed.      Sleeps in my bed when I'm sleeping and paws my face while I'm sleeping.      Pads my chest.      Curls up next to me on the sofa.      Sits on my lap when I'm reading.      Meows at me.      Sleeps on my clothes.      Shows me his belly.      Watches me from the window when I go to school.      Plays with the toys I buy him, while my other cat, Simba,  doesn't.      When we were looking for cats, he was the last one we saw and he came straight to me. I was leaning down to pat him on the head, and he stood on his hind legs, grabbed my hand with his paws and nuzzled it. (love at first sight?)      I think he loves me, but what do you guys think? Sometimes cats can just do all that for food.... *cough*Simba*cough*      Thank you!

We told the doctor that he doesn't gobble down his treat he hides them and the doctor thought nothing of it. I'm not sure what to think of it, he doesn't act any different than he used to, he just doesn't like to eat. it's odd my other 2 pugs act like they have never eaten and he could care less. any opinions.

Is this something that can wait till tomorrow or do I need to call an emergency vet? As to the aftercare sheet my son accidently threw it out.

20090202184905AAsIJg9	Pets;Birds	Is this person considered a backyard breeder?	I bought a german shep pup from a lady on Sat. She had an ad in the newspaper.She was selling them for $500. She had 13 pups from 3 different litters. She said she was down from another state, visiting a friend and brought the puppies with her, to sell. Just the pups, not the parents. So, after about an hour or so, we finally picked the perfect pup! She then offered us 2 pups for $600.00 We only wanted 1 puppy, so thats what we got, 1. She said she had wormed them twice and had given them their 1st set of shots. She gave us a paper she had filled out for C.K.C.(Still not sure what that is)  Saturday evening, we brought our puppy home. She didn't eat anything all weekend, and I made sure I bought the same puppy food she had been eating.She did drink plenty of water, just wouldn't eat. This morning , she had diarrhea and her poor tummy was making all kinds of noises and sounds. I called the vet, and they said it was most likely her nerves and she had changed houses 3 times in 2 days, but if it continued over a day to bring her in. I took her outside again to go to the bathroom, and  a big, long , white worm about 8 inches long came out of her!!! So, naturally. I freak out and took her to the vet immediately. They did a fecal on her and she had roundworm and hookworm. The vet said, usually, if she was dewormed as the lady said, the worms would come out in her poop, but they should be dead. The worm that came out of my puppy was alive and well and doing fine, squirming around on the ground. So, if she had wormwd the puppies twice as she said, how could a worm that big, live thru it? I am kinda thinking and questioning if she actually did worm the pup or even gave the 1st set of shots. I have NEVER bought a dog before. Usually, I go to the shelter or pound to save a life. I have been searching for weeks at every shelter , pound and rescue  in 4 surrounding counties, and nobody has German Shepard puppies. So, is this lady a backyard breeder? I am keeping my puppy, no matter what. She is ours for the next 15 years!! :)

20090202122954AAgfvoI	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone have any information on Yugo? -please read-?	Yugo is a 5 year old, American bulldog-mix who was found on the side of a highway with burns on his front legs and ear. A woman picked him up and brought him to the East Providence Animal Control Center. The veterinarian said the burns are about two weeks old. Animal Control Officer, William Muggle, considered euthanizing the dog, but then said, "The dog had a great disposition, even with the severity of this wounds. I was picking him up to walk him up the stairs of the ER, and he wagged his tail and he didn't growl." Caring for Yugo's extensive wounds will cost hundreds. On top of having badly burned front legs, Yugo was also malnourished. If you have any information on Yugo's neglectors or want to make a donation please call; (401) 435-7675.

20090202124502AA1GxL2	Pets;Dogs	Keeping a border collie occupied?	My wife and I recently adopted a 2-year-old border collie -- it was hit by a car and the owner never answered our fliers/ads. Instead of sending an injured dog to a shelter, we added him to our already existing family of two dogs.    When we're gone, the dogs stay in a spare bedroom with toys and a dog door that leads to a 20x20 fenced in portion of the back yard.    Now that his leg is healed, this border collie is back to his old self. According to the vet, we lucked out and got a pretty well-mannered border collie compared to some. He's affectionate and likes to be around us; he's just obsessed with playing fetch.    My wife and I work the typical 8-hour day 5 days a week, so he's alone with the other dogs during that time. Obviously, a dog like that gets bored.    For a while, he was only destroying his soft toys. Then we came home to find that he had pulled out the stuffing of one of the dog beds. The next day, he destroyed the other dog bed.     And as an intact male, he seems to be marking certain areas of the room.    I want to start walking him every day and playing frisbee outside so he at least has that routine to look forward to. Is there anything else i can do for him? We cannot afford to have anyone come in and play with him or walk him during the day.

One last thing insted of him going a lot of pee once, he goes a little multiple times , just wondering if he just has a small bladder or if he`s just excitedly marking or what so ya thanks.

20090202191323AAyS6Iy	Pets;Birds	Cockatiel socialization problem?	I recently adopted a cockatiel from a shelter (about 6 mo. ago). When he came home, he had a severe biting problem. He would sit on my shoulder or arm and chirp hapily, but if I brought my hand near he'd bite it. He has gotten SO much better. He doesn't bite any more, and lets me even touch his head. However, this new trust is to me and me alone. He trusts my hand, and only my hand. While he has gotten better somewhat with other household members, and occasionally lets mom pet him, he still doesn't like my sister at all. Is there anything I can do, or does he just not like her? I've read about birds getting attached to just one person before and not anyone else, could it be that, or could it be a trust issue?

20090202191842AAmCqYE	Pets;Horses	Question about jugular vein thrombosis?	Okay... December 2007 my mare got jugular vein thrombosis on the right side after being sedated by the vet. We took her to the vet, they put an IV in her left jugular vein, and she promptly got another clot on that side. After a couple weeks at the hospital, she was allowed to come home.      Now, I read somewhere that when a horse gets jugular vein thrombosis, they cannot get a shot of any kind in their jugular vein, or they could get another clot.      When my vet came out to do a Coggins on her last November, I explained to him what had happened. He told me she would be fine, and did it anyway.      Is this okay to do? He's a really good vet, and I trust him, but that seemed a little weird to me.

I got two dumbo rats a few weeks ago and Vald, the rat acting weird, was totally fine yesterday and this morning once I left for school. When I got home tonight I was going to let him out with Tybalt, the other rat, to run around and stuff. But he just started hissing and stuff once I tryed to touch him. I left him alone for a while after that; I then noticed that Vald did the same thing when Tybalt walked around and got to close to him.       I don't know whats wrong and I'm really worried. I have never had rats before these two. Also, last week I did a science experiment with them and I feed Vald popcorn, while Tybalt ate the normal rat food. My mom thinks that it's just that he hasn't taken a crap but we don't know that. I don't want to take him to a vet if it only turns ou to be something simple. So if some one knows it would be nice.       Thank you.

20090202192112AAmiPsK	Pets;Reptiles	Turtles water is always dirty and other problems!?	I have a Chinese box turtle, had him since I was 7, hes lived in a 10 gallon tank his whole life with a leaf and a rock to sit on. I recently got a 40 galon tank, so I put about 100 bucks into making it very nice and he now has a new home. 3 problems. I have live plants so I put top soil, and then some coconut fiber bedding on top of that, first is he always tramples through the damn plants. Is there something I can do from keeping him doing this? As soon as I walk away he tramples the plants. Im thinking of just buying fakes and siliconing them to the bottom of the glass. Second one is tricky, I have a paint roller pan (brand new dont worry) as a water area, so its like a little slope and he can regulate how deep he wants to be. the problem is since it is surrounded by top soil and coconut fiber and he is covered in it, it gets dirty as soon as I change it. Is this a problem? WHat can I do to prevent it? And finaly, he seems to be only interested in escaping as all he ever does in aquariums is walk into the glass. Im thinking I should maybe cover all the sides of glass with a background so he doesnt think he can get out and wont walk into the glass all day? ANy advice? THanks. My main problem is the water though.
20090202192248AA7HxyY	Pets;Fish	Molly Fish Is Not Eating!?	I just got two mollies about a week ago.  I thought one was a boy (golden color) and the other a girl (dalmation).   The Dalmation one bullies the golden one.   After reading a bit I figured out it is actually two girls (both have triangle shape anal fin).         Just yesterday I noticed that the Dalmation had given birth!   No wonder she was so fat.  I thought that was the way they normally look.        Anyway, I separated the babies out to their own tank and ended up cleaning the main tank since I had to drag everything out of it to get all the babies out from under all the round glass pieces I had on the bottom.  I completely changed out all the water because it looked gross due to the poo and old fish food floating all around (I have backed off on the amount of food I give them).         The Dalmation one is still very happy boistrous and eats a ton, but the golden one is now hovering near the bottom and not eating.  I even put in an algae flake right next to her and nothing.        At first I thought it was because the dalmatian bullies her so much, but even when she is left alone she just sits there looking listless.  What did I do wrong and how can I get her to eat?

He's only been in our backyard which he's lived in his whole life.  We can't think of anything he might've gotten into and eaten or anything.  If you have any ideas or recognize the symptoms or ANYTHING!!!! please let me know!!!!
