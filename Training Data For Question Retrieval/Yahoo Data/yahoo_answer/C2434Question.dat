20090219234545AABG1Ac	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Law of Attraction doesn't work.....?	I decided to take up the 100-day Secret/Law of Attraction challenge, and quit halfway through. Reasons why? I did everything that was in the book (think positive, visualize, etc) and I always got what I didn't want and worse. Today, I had bought a book called EVERYTHING of the Law of Attraction before work and I had the most horrible and most stressful day at work you could possibly imagine, so I took the book back and the bad luck just seemed to die away.       I'm not sure what I did wrong. I visualized, thought positive as much as I could and I am really thankful for what I have in my life now, and me being a writer I even wrote down what I wanted in the present tense, but in the end I've come up with nothing but, well, like I said, a lot of negative stuff.  Maybe it only happens to lucky people, and Lord knows I'm one of the most unluckiest guys around (and I can say that because I've about quit on the LOA. I do have a history of putting myself down before I even heard about the Law of Attraction.) And for the record, I do not concentrate on what I don't want.       What am I doing wrong? Either I'm doing something wrong or the Law of Attraction is just a scam that uses positive thinking to get money from us.

20090220002041AA1BxG2	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	If our body is just a vessel to our soul, do you think our sexual orientation is just a vessel to our love?	I just had this thought while I was sitting in the toilet. Aren't toilets amazing for giving inspirations!      But I was just wondering about it, since the nature and discussions about body and soul is somewhat similar to sexual orientation and love.      The love is the most important thing of all, and sexual orientation is just something to achieve a bigger and better love. Like our soul, which should be more important than our body.      We strive to gain better soul, and the way to achieve it is always different from each person, because the vessel which we are born with are different than each other. And we should optimize our soul with the vessel we got.

20090220001541AAqtlmw	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does an external reality really exist, or is it simply a product of the mind?	I often think and wonder if something existing in our physical realm is only existing because we are aware of it's presence, and that we understand it's usefulness in relation to something else, which brings about another cause and effect, that could further enhance our subjective awareness of us being a living reality. I believe reality to be a woven state of consciousness, continually interpreting how to use the physical world to expand it's conscious purview. A something exists only in terms of our awareness of it, and how it can be manipulated into our design for the purpose of progression. If I ascribe something to having a physical mass, colour, size, and shape it is because my mind has created a form of the external object, and has made it real in my conscious understanding.          What are your views?

Don't most book writers have day-jobs or other careers to make money, and just write on the side? I've aspired to be a writer since I was very young, and I had this delusion that, the writer's life was a glamorous one, from all the successes you hear from best-selling authors. I was under the impression, that that's all a writer's life would entail, just writing.      So, realistically, what is the life of a writer?

But I had no idea I would be part of the greatest discoveries in all of mankind." - Dr. Mansing    No tracings, no warness......nothing.The meteor soared into Earth's orbit in a blink of an eye. Hitting,the Atlantic Ocean, the meteor created a vast island stretching from western America to eastern Europe. The meteor was only half a mile in diameter, therefore, the tsunami would not hit land. Passing by in a helicopter, Dr. Robert Mansing had been hit by the giant wave. Sending him to the shore of the newborn island, Dr. Mansing discovers many alien creatures with extraordinary abilities. These creatures are here to fight the Xiotan alliance, an alien force secretly living in Earth. The Xiotans want to take control of the power core, the source for all life for Earth and surrounding planets. The island contains the core in its crust. If the core is destroyed Earth and half of the galaxy will die as well.

20081004083934AAKmg9d	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	POEM:PIANO - What does the poet (DH Lawrence) mean when saying "poised feet"?	Piano      Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;   Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see   A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings   And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.         In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song   Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong   To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside   And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano our guide.         So now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamour   With the great black piano appassionato. The glamour   Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast   Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.      D. H. Lawrence         What does it signify that the poet only describes the mother physically through feet?

20080712042149AAVDcwM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this opening good for the book i am wrighting.?	Into the….         My name is Trevor and I am 15, I have an 11 year old brother named Joey and a 2 month old sister named Tina. I can still remember the day my life changed.  I now live alone in an old abandon shed in a forest with my siblings. Life is hard when you lose you Parents.   Everyday is trying to survive…….          Chapter 1: Why live?      “Hey Joey!” Trevor called out.  “Take care of your sister while I go see if I can get some food down the village for dinner tonight.”  Joey ignored and continued playing with his almost torn stuffed bear. “Hey! Are you evening listening to me?” Joel said. “Yeah yeah…. I heard you the first time.”  Joey snapped. “Take care of sister till you come back, see I heard.” Trevor sighed and went to go grab his worn out shoes from the old dusty cabinet.  “Make sure you don’t leave her alone in the house and go throwing stones at animals in the forest again.”  Trevor said goodbye to Joey and Tina and walking out the wooden door. Joel reached the small village called Tamvill. Once there Trevor saw am old women that dropped her groceries. “Are you ok?” asked Trevor?  “Why yes dear. Thanks for your concern, but aren’t you one of those pesky kids from that Pock Gang.” Said the lady nervously. Trevor started picking up the lady’s groceries and putting them in the brown paper bag.  “No, I am not. Who is the Pock Gang?” asked Trevor. “You never heard of the Pock Gang? Said the lady in much surprisement. “They are the most ruthless band of teenagers who go around beating people for the fun of it. Why yesterday they almost killed a 14 teen year old girl with long black hair with a cute butterfly Hair pin who would have got killed if it wasn’t for a small boy with a worn out teddy in his hand. He took her to the east side of town and took care of her till her bruises were okay. Oh my how time flies!” The lady said while looking at her watch. “Here have these” The lady handed a batch of bananas, gallon of milk and a loaf of bread to Trevor. “Thanks, I am very grateful.” Trevor said while taking the stuff. “Take care and try not to get in trouble with those Pock Gang members.” The old lady said waving to Trevor. “Well I came what I came here for and looks like I have some free time.” Trevor said in his head. He walked to the small river on the west side of the village. He saw a girl about his age standing dangerously on the edge of the bridge. “Hey what the hell are you doing?” Trevor yelled out to the girl. “There are ones that get up and just end up falling again.” Said the girl crying. Trevor notice the pin she had on her head was a butterfly. “What do you mean? I don’t understand! Please get down from there.” Said Trevor. “Shut up! You don’t know what I have been threw! She shouted. She started to fall. Trevor ran as fast as he could and grabbed her hand. “Let go! I have no choice but to do this! If you have been threw what I have you would do the same.” She pleaded. “Shut up! You’re not going to die while I still live.” said Trevor with watery eyes. “Well I guess we will just have to fix that.” Said a mysterious voice. Trevor pulled the girl up as hard as he could. “It’s the guys from before.” Trevor looked and saw three guys, one with think long hair with a Mohawk and a tooth pick in his mouth. The second one was a short hair but very tall. The last one was very short but looked built and had torn raged short. “The name is Ryan, Pock Gang member. I see out little trouble maker has found a new partner. Should we kill him? Ryan said in a cocky voice. “Yeah! Let’s kill the boy and have fun with the girl.” The tall boy said. The girl just took off her shoes and threw them straight at Ryan’s face. “You little slut! You’re going to pay for that!” Ryan said trying to stop his nose from bleeding. Ryan pulled a gun out from his pocket. “What now? You suddenly froze! You scared? I bet you are!” said Ryan slowing coming to the girl and Trevor. Ryan heard to splashes behind him. He turned around and saw a boy with curly black hair and Brown eyes. He noticed that his two Gang member were gone. “Where the hell are they? What did you do with them?” Ryan demanded. “You more stupid than you look. Here let me explain the even you little pea sized brain can understand. I T-h-r-e-w T-h-e-m O-f-f. You get it now?” “You’re going to die for that!” said Ryan. He pointed the gun and the curly haired boy. Trevor ran up and grabbed Ryan’s hand. He got the gun and Ryan fell back. Trevor pointed the gun at Ryan. “Hey no need to get hasty. I was just playing around.” Ryan said. Ryan got up and started walking back slowly. The curly haired boy ran at Ryan and pushed him off the bridge. “Hey, say hi to my father for me when you reach hell!” Shouted the curly haired boy. “You killed him….. You killed them all! Why?” said Trevor fumbling the gun. “What are you, still a little boy who need his blanky? It was either us or them. You would have ended it up shooting him anyway.” Said the curly haired boy. “Who are you?" Said the girl whipping off her tears. “My name is Mezzo.” Said the curly haired boy.

Like sometimes you just feel on top of the world, like you can do anything...then not too long after feel empty and sorta down. I mean, I know as you grow up you kinda lose that childish joy and get worn in by the world...I tend to be somewhat of a melancholy personality type anyway...And I don't think I really suffer from clinical depression or anything. It's just it seems like as i've gotten older, you feel down a lot more...I know I find a lot of inspiration from music, but still sometimes, I mean, whether it's physical or spiritual or emotional situations, it's harder to be positive through the annoying or tough things you go through...Any thoughts?

20081106190845AAss3eP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Need help writing a book?	I'm attempting to write a book. I'm only fourteen so I really don't have that much experience with writing but I really do have a passion for it and it's what I want to do for the rest of my life. Currently, I have a plot, and almost a complete outline for the book. I have typed the first four chapters, but they are only about 6,000 words. I have read the average novel is from 70,000 to 80,000 words (please correct me if I'm wrong). I have asked my language arts teacher and she said to try and work in a few motifs a bit. I am still having trouble though because I have made an outline for it, but I am only predicting 11 chapters. I average about 1,500 words per chapter which is only an estimate of 16,500 words for my entire book. My question is how can I add things in to make it longer and get my word count up?

But the one thing he said was in the gas chambers when they thought they were getting a shower. You could see marks where people dug their nails into the walls trying to escape. I was just wondering if that was true, if it was so horrible that people would could do that in a desperate attempt to escape?      And also his story had me extremely curious about the camp in general. So can someone give me some websites or video links where i can learn more?
20081113223403AAOaLSC	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	Is it complete enough or does it need another verse?      Shadows,    Cold and empty   Clutching at me   Always there   Lurking just out of sight   I cannot see the face    But I want to erase   These shadows from my mind.   Hauntingly familiar,    I've been on this road before.   Shadows pull me downward,   Before I reach the door.   Falling,   Reaching up to shield my heart   I find that someone's taken it   And ripped it all apart.
