So, I think I might be pregnant (long story) but the HPTs are coming up negative, I keep trying to get a blood test to find out and I am sort of limited to my options. There are only 3 places here that do it, one of them I can afford (I know obvious answer go with that one) the only catch is is that I have to order the test on-line and then go to the lab and take it. My problem is that it would not be a doctor that could answer my questions. I have called every place in the phone book that i could after calling the health department and all of the pregnancy care center that are supposed to do blood tests, but none of them do. There for they would not be able to tell me what was causing my period to be 17 days late. So what do I do now. I still have a while before my insurance kicks in, so that option is out. And I am so lost and confused it isn't even funny!! Can anyone give me any advice on this??

20090225124846AA78oBC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is it too early to suspect shes pregnant?	I have a female Pomeranian Shih Tzu mix and a male purebred Shih Tzu. My female was in heat about 2 weeks ago. It seemed to be a very short heat cycle and it was her first cycle because she’s only a year. Well my male shih tzu has always tried to hump her and she refused but just near the end of her very short cycle she finally allowed him to do so. They locked on February 8th and then they locked again the very next day! It’s been 2 weeks since the mating occurred. My female dog has been looking like she’s putting on weight and her nipples are bigger and there is a lump underneath them. I’ve been calling the vet and doing as much research as possible about pregnancy and dogs because I plan to have a career in the veterinarian field. I’m just a little confused about her being pregnant or experiencing a false pregnancy. It’s only been 2 weeks. Is it too soon for signs like bigger nipples, sleeping a lot, laziness, and slightly bigger belly? Please answer this and tell me what you guys think. Thank you so much!!                  ^^^^^ alot of poeple have been saying im a mean person and dumb person because my animals bred together. well it wasnt a planned pregnancy. dogs and dogs not humans. they dont always know whats best for them. there is no way i would ever hurt my dogs or harm her puppies. i know shes a little too young but im not an animal killer im not getting them aborted i love my dogs very much. and i dont think her pups are going to be abanded or neglected there for family members not for people in the paper. ive bought from people in the paper thats where the dad and mom are from i know the problems that come along with that and im gonna make sure her pups are safe and loved with people i know and trust.         thank you very much!!!

20090225130457AAbIPB7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Do a lot of 7 year old girls have anxiety?	I had a parent teacher conference with my 7 year old daughter's teacher yesterday. The teacher said that she is doing well with her work and gets along well with others. But then she commented that my daughter is very emotional, sensitive, and worries a lot. I said yeah I know she is like her mom because I am the same way. Well then she brought it up a few more times and said that she obsesses over things that she can not control such as world events. After she brought it up a third time I flat out asked what she is getting at and she said that she thinks it may be something that needs to be addressed with her doctor! I was astonished.       I know that she is sensitive but I never thought of it as a problem. It does not interfere with her daily activities and she has a lot of friends. In fact I always thought of it as a good thing because she is so kind and cognoscente of other peoples feelings and she behaves well because she thinks carefully before she acts.       I definitely do not agree with her teacher about it being a problem but I just wanted to ask if there are other 7 year olds that are the same way?

Im 39 weeks pregnant and currently in a really stressful situation which involves me trying to get housed before my baby is born, living with my in laws in very close proximity and trying to get many financial and legal things sorted on my own while my husband works and focuses on university. Today something happened that wasnt too good, as a result of my head being everywhere and me and my husband had a huge huge argument, with his mother getting involved and comments being made that were unhelpful and upsetting to me.       Since becoming pregnant my mind has transformed from thinking rationally and logically to being all over the place and making really rash stupid decisions. I am devastated about it and my husband and other people get so angry about it, I cry all the time because I feel like nobody understands what Im going through. Im under the most amount of stress, as is he with his uni work and no matter how hard I try to explain myself nothing works, I feel like my brain has been stamped on and I feel absolutely furious not being able to think or act straight.       Today I had an antenatal appointment and my blood pressure was very high twice and the doctor said it seemed to be creeping up. I have no swelling or any signs of pre-eclampsia such as protein in my urine etc but its due to the stress and I dont know what to do. Im due to give birth in 5 days and need advice on how to relax. Im crying as Im typing this as sad as that sounds, but I feel so alone, under pressure to be the perfect wife especially in front of my mother in law, and to be 'on point' all the time with all the stuff Im trying to sort out. Im scared my baby will have suffered badly from the stress as Ive had it throughout my entire pregnancy and he is my first child. Can anyone share similar stressful experiences and does anyone know good ways to calm down and stay patient and relaxed? I would really appreciate some answers, thankyou so much x

20090225130240AA6YjSp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is my sister pregnant?	My sister has been gaining weight, mainly in her belly area, and has also started feeling what she refers to as baby kicks. She took hom epregnancy tests, they came out negative. She also went in to her doc and he listened to her stomach, and she said it sounded like a baby's heartbeat like you would hear when they do an ultra sound, but he told her that was her heartbeat. The doc also took a blood test and it came out negative that she was pregnant. Is it still possible? Is there anything else that comes to mind that would be causing this baby kicking in her belly, and weight gain in that area? I saw a pic of her (we live far awa) and she really does look pregnant.

We were at a play rehearsal and during a break we were talking, and when I was complaining jokingly about something, I crossed my arms and pouted a little, then laughed.     he laughed too and said "Look at that mini-tantrum. It's absolutely adorable."     I laughed and said, "yeah, i guess it was two-year-oldish."    He said, "no, it's kind of awesome."

20090225130025AAyDfnZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do I Have A Right To Request A Paternity Test?	I live in Oregon and about 7 years ago when I was 18, I had relations with a friends sister. About a week after we stopped having relations she got in a relationship with another guy and that same week discovered she was pregnant. I had asked multiple times if there was any chance I was the father and she told me no it was the other guys. After she had the girl I had asked again and was assured that I wasn't the father. Now 7 years later I got back in touch with my old friend and saw some pictures of the little girl. The little girl looks very similar to myself and nearly identical to my daughter I had 5 years ago. I asked my friend about it and she told me that her sister had mentioned the similarity a couple years earlier, but just left it at that. Right now the little girl is in child protective custody. They have been permanently taken away from her mother because she has sever drug problems. The supposed father is away in prison for the next ten years. I am very stable, I make good money and am fully capable of taking care of a child. I know I have an obligation to that girl to take care of her if she is mine, but I don't know what kind of rights I have to find out if she is. Please, only give serious well knowledgeable answers. Thanks

I rarely talk about my emotions, and it's hard for me to communicate to my friends when I'm upset, so it's easier to talk on here.  Here are some things that went wrong   ?I was late to school   ?I hate my new schedule   ?I got a C on my math final   ?My friend is mad at me for a reason I don't understand   ?I have more homework than ever, and I have to go somewhere at 5, which is in less than a half hour, and I don't get home until 9:30.  And please don't tell me I should be doing that instead, I really need to get my anger off my chest.   ?I thought I had unlimited texting, I guess not because I owe my parents $270.   ?The guy I like is in one of my classes, so is his girlfriend   ?I'm PMSing horribly, and so my emotions are all mixed up and I have the worst cramps ever!

20090225132007AAdXY7a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	2 month old immunizations?	ok i am gonna ask about vaccinations and for those out there that say i shouldnt do it i dont want your advice.  My son already got his vaccinations and will continue to get them as his dr. reccomends.  and this is kinda long, but thank you for taking the time to read and answer me.        ok now so yesterday my son had his 2month well child check up.  he got his normal vaccinations: hib, polio, pneumococcal,hep b, DTaP,and rotovirus.   my questions are:      how high is too high of a temp for a 2 month old?(just need to know i have heard several different numbers)      how much crying/fussyness is considered a bad reaction? i know some fussyness is normal,but he all he does when he is awake is screams/cries. and normaly he is a happy baby that rarely cries only to say feed me or change.       and how do you determine that the child is sleeping to much or lethargic when they aren't really playful at this age? normally he is sleeps for 4hrs awake for 4 hrs sleep for 4 awake for 3-4hrs.  now  he is only awake fo 30-60 minutes between sleeping 3-4hrs at a time.      fyi: i have called the dr. office and asked the nurse questions atleast 8 times in the last two days and now they are just blowing me off as an over paranoid mother and not really answering my questions.  I know i have two older children, but my youngest is 4.5yrs so its been a while and things change and i just want to make sure he is ok.  my oldest had to be hospitalized with an iv in her head at 2wks for fever and my middle was recently hospitalized with an iv because of a severe kidney infection with a fever of 106. so i AM really paranoid when it comes to sick babies.

Its about a 15yr old girl who gets pregnant, but nothing bad ever happens to her. I mean she has someone that loves her, her family is well off, her parents support her, and she's still able to go to school to get an eduaction.      where here in real life, most people dont have enough money to support a new baby, most girls have to drop out of school to take care of the kid, and the father usually forgets all about the girl and ditches her.      I just think this show gives kids like my age (13) the wrong idea of what its really like to have a kid. It annoys me so much when all the 13-15yr olds in the Adolescent section are saying they are ready to have sex, and they don't really know the consequenses that may follow.      ( ~ 8*

20090225131517AAoZWEb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am 99.9% sure I'm feeling flutters at 11w.  Why does no one believe me?	It started at 10w6d (Sunday, I'm 11w2d today) and has kept happening with more and more frequency since then.  It feels like I'm being tickled from the inside, not the belly, but the pelvis.  It happens when I'm laying down and relaxing, OR, like just now, when I sneezed (I think I woke the baby up).      Everything I read, with the odd exception, says it's too early, unless you're super skinny (which, I assure you, I am not).  This is definitely not gas, nowhere near the correct area for that.  And the timing of when I feel it, and exactly what I'm feeling, matches everything else I've read, except how early I am in my pregnancy.      I doubt I'm further along than I think, as I've had ultrasounds.        The only "x-factor", if you will, is that I had surgery to remove a huge ovarian cyst and an ovary a few years ago, with a "bikini" cut.  Do you think this would make me feel my baby sooner?

Well it was making me a nervous wreck, so just now i called my doctor and told her what the lady had said, because they had schedualed me another ultrasound but not for another 6 weeks and i thought that was a little far off for a problem like amniotic fluid, anyways, She said my doctor was out of town,but she seemed to know my problem right away, she knew who i was and had my file right there on her desk already before i even told her my name which kind of made me nervous to, but if they're was something terribly wrong would they have already told me to come in instead of waiting for my doctor to get back in town before he called me??Its so confusing.

20090225130933AA226sY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do I handle this situation with my daughter and her friend?	My daughter is 9, she rides the bus home with her friend everyday. The friends mom and I arranged it, because I work until 5 and my daughter hated the afterschool program.    It was really going well until the last couple of weeks, the little girl has started being mean to my daughter and to another little girl that stays there (her cousin). To me it bothers my child so it bothers me,  But she says really mean things to my daughter and the other little girl,  I have made little comments to her mother about it and her response was " I don't know why ****** is being so mean lately" and then jumps to something that made her little girl upset a few days before. Which solves nothing. I would really like to sit all the girls down and talk to them about it but I feel like it might be pushing the boundaries of what I have the right to do.    My daughter is very sensitive, her feelings are easily hurt. Especially when her best friend is all of a sudden being ugly.    What is the best and most tactful way to deal with this? My husband have discussed taking our lunches late and picking her up from school and taking her to our house to stay by herself until her brother gets home from school  (great grandmother is next door but confined to a wheel chair so she can't meet the bus for drop off)   I know kids have little fights but this is going on several weeks...I would really like for them to work this out whatever the problem is, I am just not sure what to tell my daughter to do, I hate that their friendship is suffering!

My sil who will give birth in a few months is totally against bf-ing (don't know why don't care either), anyways she stated that they give checks for formula regardless of income. she was angry because Wic is no longer going to give out checks for formula till a baby is 6 months (in order to ensure that a baby gets the attempt of being breastfed), and that she will lie on her application in order to get these checks. Is all this true about the 6 month thing? It seems like such a grossly negligent thing on my sil behalf.

Even if I tell them before the teachers and tell them I had no idea it was illegal... So do you think I am going to get a call home? And is the school even allowed to do this? Because at the beginning of the year they gave us these books with rules and everything and i remember it says "We do not have the responsibilities of anything that happens outside of school" or something like that. And besides the rumors going around none of this happened at school. And i didn't have permission form him to make the account. But I didn't really threaten the kid or anything like that.

20090128135314AAnyN4C	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My body, my choice, right? Wrong!?	I asked this more than a year ago, but I want other opinions. I was pregnant 3 times by age 19. I kept my children and don't regret it. That being said, at age 17, I had 2 children. I wanted sterilized, and was told no. Why? Because you have to be at least 21 to get a tubal in Illinois. I know that by age 21, I could have had as many abortions as I pleased. Because it's my body and my reproductive rights. But those rights don't count for permanent birth control. At 20, I had my third son. I'm currently on the shot and my husband got a vasectomy to ensure no "oops" pregnancies, but I'm taking it further. I'm getting a tubal as well as soon as I can. But, why does an underaged woman's rights stop at sterilization? I was even told to hold off at age 21 "in case I want more children." My hands are full and 3 kids is definitely enough for my husband and I. I got my consultation appointment for 2 weeks after I turn 21.      Do you think it's right that someone can get 10 abortions or have 10 children by age 21, but can't make the choice to get sterilized before that?       And for everyone who may say something like close your legs or don't have sex, I'm married. I'm not going to not make love to my husband because people say I shouldn't.

I mean yeah, I know it is normal, hormones and all that, but when I feel dizzy, I feel like my head gets hot, really hot and than my heart starts to go fast and I feel like I am going to faint. I found out that it happens on hot days, when the weather gets too hot or my body really gets too hot or when I push myself, walking around too much and doing too many things around the House or outside. I don't do anything heavy though, just little things, like cooking, dusting the house, vacuuming, you know, normal things we women all do around the house!

I'm dating a senior, and its really hard to find times to hang out because my parents are strict.

20090128135300AAPZHyd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What do you think? Could I be?	I have a 28-31 day cycle. My cycle was 29 days long. I started on the 15th of Jan. It'll be 2 weeks ago tomorrow that I had my period. According to my calculations my ovulation days started on the yesterday the 27th. My fiance' works alot so it's hard to make time. We had sex on the 26, but it was a quickie, because he had to go to work, (He didn't *** though?) We also did it on the 24th. We don't get much time to, and I hope my chances are good, We had sex alot before that to. After a great deal of research, Alot of women have a very regular period like me, and conceive right after their period is over. From what I've read technically Nobody, not even fertility doctors really know when you ovulate even if you have a regular cycle. Thats just what I've read.    Anyways, I hope this is my lucky month.    I've been having symptoms, Regardless if it's to early these are my smyptoms:   my nipples are darker   and I've been feeling extremely Nauseated.      No rude comments please.   Some opinions and stories are welcome.
20090128134555AAXSgKq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	2 yr. old potty help?  kind of gross.?	I have a daughter who is a little over 2 yrs old.  We been trying very hard to potty train her because she won't keep a diaper on.  She won't consistently go on the potty, pretty much only when she wants to.  For the past month, we have had to keep a very close eye on her because when she poops she rips her diaper off immediately and plays with it, smears it, and paints the walls with it.  I just don't know what to do.  I have tried everything but i'm at the point right now where i just have to watch her constantly because she WILL do this everyday!   i've tried putting her diaper on backwards to make it harder to take off but she just reaches down the back and pulls out a handful.  I know this is really gross but i need help!  I can't clean her horrible messes everyday!  HELP!!!!

20090128141130AApDupH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What is a good punishment for a 10 year old boy. ?	My son had three weeks to do a book report and he did not do it. My husband and I didn't even know it was assigned because he didn't tell us. We were upset and grounded him for 3 weeks with no TV, Video Game or going to his friends. We also told him he had to write another book report for us. Three weeks came and went. Yesterday we found out he had another book report due and he had three weeks to do that one as well. So the whole time he was grounded he could have been working on this new book report. He didn't even tell us he had a book report. He is the oldest of 4 so we have never really had to ground a kid before this. I'm not sure if we should be harder on him or what kind of punishment we should hand out. Any suggestions?

20090128141143AAGhBml	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think this is right?	I'm thirteen and my best friend is fourteen.       Her mom is really uptight and strict and whatnot, she barely lets her daughter do anything.       My best friend used to be over my house ALL the time a year or two ago, and her mom never had a problem with it. But last year, her mom told her that she could only stay over (and hang out) my house once a weekend because my parents smoke (cigarettes.)       Then, a few months after, her mother said she could only hang out at my house once a weekend, still because my parents smoke. No sleeping over.       And today I found out that she can no longer hang out with me, PERIOD, still because my parents smoke.      Do you think this is the stupidest thing ever or what?      I know her mom is looking out for her, but does she really have to be THAT strict about it? I think her mom has to cut her umbilical chord and let her get a life.

Then she came into my room mad and stuff and she was like give me your damn phone. I was like um, why? She was like you know. Then she snatched my phone out my hand and started going through my text messages she read a few inappropriate ones. She was like oh I see. Then said I'm not getting my phone back anytime soon, and I'm going to get on birth control. So I got mad and I said okay get out you done took what you wanted so bye!

20090128140845AAgB6rK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Unlikely or possibly pregnant?	My girlfriend and I are very careful. I use contraception and she is on the pill, but sometimes (once or twice) we do not use a condom. The most recent time was - I think - about a month or a month and a half ago.    About a week and a half ago, she had her period. She had taken two consecutive months' of contraceptive pill and had all the usual symptons: period pains, grumpiness and then, the period. Since the period her mood has stabilised, her boobs aren't so tender and have got smaller and the period pain went, as usual.    At the weekend, a few days later, my girlfriend was very ill and had the flu: fever, shiverring, cold, runny nose and she was also sick (vomiting once) after feeling a little nauseous. She spent the day off work, in bed and made a recovery.    Today and yesterday she advises that she is feeling better but that she has pains in her stomach (like digestive pains) which are worse immediately after she eats something.    I'm worried about her and think she should see the doctor, but she doesn't want to worry them and says that she is better today than yesterday, but I'm worried that there is a possibility she could be pregnant? I think it's highly unlikely as she has had her period, but is it still possible? She is losing weight rather than gaining weight, boobs are not tender and are shrinking and it has been quite a while since we had unprotected sex (she was on the pill still at the time).    Any ideas? I'm thinking she may simply be suffering from flu or norovirus, but I'm just a bit concerned!

20090128141805AA0wpWx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about my monthly cycle?	I'm 15 years old and my periods still aren't regular. I started my periods back in April 2006, almost 3 years ago.   Surely they should be regular by now?      I know they can take time to settle and I thought after 3 years I'd be regular. Well, I was wrong.      I'm a little over weight. Admittedly, I could lose around 10lbs but I find it hard to lose weight due to lack of motivation and any weight lost isn't as apparent as I would've hoped.      My mother has talked about putting me on the pill to regulate my cycles. At 15, I don't want to be on the pill for various reasons. The main one is possible weight gain and I cannot gain any weight.      Is there anyway I can increase the regularity of my cycles? I got my period today - 26 days later than it should have come.      Another thing is that they often last for up to 9 days and I'm on very heavy. Could this be helped by going on the pill?      I'm beginning to become worried about this affecting my fertility as an adult.

20070610115129AA8AxWk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am I obsessed with been pregnant?	Ok Ladies, brace yourself!   Me and my hubby have only been trying for a month but I have a strong feeling my body isn't working how it should. My periods used to be 35 days to the dot, now between 35 and 45.   i used Ovulation predictor and had positive LH surge on day 35! Got down to it that night, and the night before and after! After 5 days had dark brown discharge for 2 days, then went clear with a few tiny brown bits. It's now 9 DPo and i had red this morning and slight cramps. This is nothing like usual period, i get brown for a day or 2 then heavy red. No more red this eve or cramps just a little brown again. Does this sound like any one else? I have used a pantyliner all week with just a few spots. I am really confused, think I may just be hoping rather than possible. Breasts were very tender and sore nipples but all seems normal again. I would love to be pregnant but don't want to do a test now as too scared it will say no!   Thanks in advance! x

Il m'a ausculté et m'a dit qu'aparamment j'avais un fibrome. Il m'a demandé une échographie pour être certain de son diagnostic. je l'ai fait et l'échographe lui me dit qu'il ne voit pas de fibrome mais plutot un sac non embryonné. Selon lui, c'est le signe d'une grossesse qui pourrait évoluer comme ne pas évoluer. Nous avons fait un test de grossesse qui s'est révélé positif. J'ai encore un autre rendez-vous avec l'échographe la semaine prochaine pour voir si ce sac dont il a parlé a évolué ou non. En attendant, il me demande de me reposer. Pourtant je travaille et il est difficile de me faire remplacer .Je me dis que j'ai enfin de l'espoir parce que je veux un bébé mais j'ai très peur parce que j'ai eu une perte de sang hier. Ce sac non embryonné pourrait il évoluer ? Je ne veux pas perdre cet espoir de faire un bébé. Que dois-je faire ? Aidez moi si vous avez déjà vécu cette situation.
