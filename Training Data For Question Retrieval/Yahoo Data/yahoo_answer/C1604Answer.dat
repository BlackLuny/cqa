keGOvavbaa	Frequent flier miles can be accumulated by a passenger on a ticket regardless of who pays for it, so yes, you could accrue miles based on tickets purchased for you by your employer.  To claim the miles, you'd have to give your FF number when you check in or somehow attach it to the reservation before you fly (by giving it to your corporate travel agent, going online to add the number to the reservation, or by calling the airline directly).|`|AA11496012	Yes, most companies allow you to keep your miles even if they pay for the ticket.  When you book your flight, just make sure you give them your frequent flier account number.  Even if you forget, you have up to 1 year to tell the airline that you want mileage credit for your trip.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Yes. Your frequent flyer account follows your name, and has nothing to do with who buys the ticket for you. Some companies are setting up programs where the miles go into one account, for the company to use. But you would already know if they are doing that.<br>  <br>  You can redeem your miles anyway you like. Most people will just use their miles for a free ticket on a personal vacation. You want to book that well in advance though.

If only In-laws were that easy, right???<br>  I guess the beauty of a paper hat is that it's an example of what we wish most of our lives could be.

pTLcvsVfaa	Yes.. they do. You can also get them on Continental and Delta. But it is based on availabilty. If they have seats avialble the day prior to your flight you might get upgraded. Sometimes they will upgrade you right before flight time. To be honest, most of the time you wont even get upgraded though.

By the way, I'm not sure what you meant by your last two questions but they seem a little inflammatory. If someone chooses not to wear green then that is their prerogative.|`|q9PVawNyaa	No. That's an American thing.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Clothes-wise, no. There is no hard and fast rule that you HAVE to wear green. Many people wear shamrock badges - with real shamrock, which apparently grows only in Ireland. And there'll be plenty of kitsch and tack and all the rest of it around too, don't worry.|`|Fu1emcF3aa	They don't take it that seriously over there. You Americans make a really big deal out of it. The Irish hardly mention it and any parades that do take place are either "gay pride" or "multicultural" stuff.

And I have no right to judge people by what they wera/don't wear,and I have no intention to do so!!<br>  But a lot of people wear a bit of shamrock on their top/jacket,or maybe even one of those big ugly badges from the shop.....<br>  =D|`|yH5deod5aa	The vast majority of us Irish do wear green, especially kids and teens, for some craic like, and if the business men or grannies are too sensible for the mad greens, the just wear shamrocks, I just grab some from the garden, wear both of them =)

vEEeq7kYaa	I see you've asked this question, or a variant, several times..so I'll just give the same answer, as perhaps it will help others.<br>  The Pesach observance (Passover) is the memorial of the day God saved Moses and Israel from Egypt and showed that the man/god of Egypt, the Pharaoh was impotent to God's power.<br>  The day before Pesach is the Fast of the Firstborn, a minor fast for all firstborn males, commemorating the fact that the firstborn Jewish males in Egypt were not killed during the final plague. <br>  the evening of the 14th of Nissan in the Hebrew calendar and the 15th is the first day of Passover<br>  Jewish Year 5769: sunset April 8, 2009 - nightfall April 16, 2009 <br>  There are many different fasts in Judaism, but Passover, the observance of God's deliverance of all Israel, is not a fast.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm</a> < tells the dates and has great information on it's observance<br>  Now for my own words and some Torah excerpts to support. I hope you will go to read Exodus in entirety.<br>  Jews are required by direct commandment in the Torah to keep the Passover observance for an eternal memorial. Passover ( Pesach in Hebrew) is the celebration of the deliverance of the eternal covenant nation Israel, the Hebrews, from the yolk of idolatry, superstition, and physical slavery in Egypt. It was a reaffirmation of their identity as a nation dedicated to God through Torah and our memorial reaffirms this for each generation. . The events we retell at Passover were demonstration to Egypt that their deities were false and their man/god Pharoah impotent to God's power.<br>  <br>  It is a very important part of Judaism and many central aspects of our identity as an eternal covenant nation are embedded in it's observance. 12:12 I will pass through Egypt on that night, and I will kill every first-born in Egypt, man and beast. I will perform acts of judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I [alone] am God.<br>  That is a very important passage there..NOTE..God will enact judgment against the false gods..plural now..of Egypt. That was the purpose of the Passover sacrifice. <br>  12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are staying. I will see the blood and pass you by (pasach). There will not be any deadly plague among you when I strike Egypt. <br>  <br>  12:27 You must answer, 'It is the Passover service to God. He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, sparing our homes.' <br>  The people bent their heads and prostrated themselves. <br>  <br>  The Passover sacrifice serves to demonstrate the people’s courage, as they take the Egyptians’ object of worship and slaughter and eat it in the service of the God of Israel. Torah is clear that the sacrifice and eating of the lamb at Pesach was the killing and eating of the false god of Egypt to show allegiance to the real God. The continuation of the Paschal lamb sacrifice is an eternal remembrance of that deliverance from idolatry and slavery. This is why no uncircumcised male or Gentile could partake of the Paschal lamb. If Christians wish to honor and observe the Passover for the meanings that are commanded in the Torah, you are welcome to attend any synagogue's community seder. Without the Temple we no longer make the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb and eat it so that command (no gentile may eat of it) is not broken. 12:42 There was a night of vigil for God, [preparing] to bring them out of Egypt. This night remains for the Israelites a vigil to God for all generations<br>  12:43 God said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the law of the Passover sacrifice: <br>  'No outsider may eat it. <br>  12:44 If a man buys a slave for cash and circumcises him, then [the slave] can eat it. <br>  12:45 [But if a gentile is] a temporary resident or a hired hand, he may not eat [the Passover sacrifice]. <br>  12:46 'It must be eaten by a single group. Do not bring any of its meat out of the group. Do not break any of its bones. <br>  12:47 'The entire community of Israel must keep [this ritual]. <br>  12:48 When a proselyte joins you and wants to offer the Passover sacrifice to God, every male [in his household] must be circumcised. He may then join in the observance, and be like a native-born [Israelite]. But no uncircumcised man may eat [the sacrifice]. <br>  12:49 The same law shall apply both for the native-born [Israelite] and for the proselyte who joins you.' <br>  <br>  Now, we have a bone representing the lamb on the plate. I have had non-Jewish friends attend many seders at my home in the past and they find that learning the Torah meaning they've often overlooked is very powerful in its messages. <br>  <br>  the link below is a great source to discover more about Yom Kippur, the major fast<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm</a><br>  <br>  and the other fasts of Judaism<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm</a>|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi. That would be Passover. Passover is a Jewish event and if you're considering, as a Gentile, trying to observe Jewish events you need to explore the Gentile's specific role to play as it is assigned within a legitimate Jewish only source. Not all Gentiles participate in all Jewish events just like Jewish people don't participate in other people's religious events. Some, as a Gentile are participative though.  So you'll just have to learn more.  I suggest you learn from site I am about to give you as they are a credible source and I know that there are many many non-credible sources out there, so BEWARE as they will be quick to lead you astray and you won't know you're astray til it's too late. Consider your warning now and save yourself the heartache later. :)  Seek only reliable Jewish sources for your info.<br>  <br>  To learn about Jewish events and how they affect Gentiles then one must know the basics, the Noahide Laws. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://noahide.org/" rel="nofollow">http://noahide.org/</a><br>  <br>  If keeping track of Jewish events are important to you (and I agree, I think some of these things are important for Gentiles to know) then try using the Hebrew Calendar and then learn about the Jewish events and how they pertain to Gentiles (from the reliable source I gave you above)  The date shifts from year to year we don't use Gregorian. <br>  <br>  Hebrew Calendar/Date Converter<br>  <a href="http://hebcal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hebcal.com/</a><br>  <br>  Why the Wall is Holy<br>  <a href="http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall_is_Holy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall...</a>

ZPxJNpMxaa	Just remember that many expats have family and friends in SA and that many left for reasons outside their control, like for instance, high crime, BBBEE, high unemployment etc.<br>  <br>  There are some that may not want to return to SA but the vast majority would return if conditions in SA improved and they could secure employment, so in no way would they wish that SA will become like Zimbabwe.<br>  <br>  If there are any expats that feel this way they are a minuscule minority, SA is their home and most living abroad see it this way.<br>  <br>  SA, however,have a number of very serious challenges to overcome and address before the majority would consider returning and the probability of Jacob Zuma being the next SA President, I personally  think, will not  fill them with too much confidence.|`|NqEZ120iaa	Not at all! I wouldn't think anyone would wish that, let alone of your own country.|`|xcDwLp4uaa	Nobody wants that. Why would anyone want their home country to be destroyed like that, to suffer like that? Your question is so ridiculous, and I suspect racist, it is actually insulting. Many expats still have family and friends there and still love the country. It is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. If anything I would guess the majority of expats want South Africa to get better so that they can go home.|`|AA11326712	What ever for?  South Africa  is not anywhere near that yet.  And,  the world will NEVER allow South Africa to deteriorate so much.<br>  <br>  The opposition parties are strong, and the voting majority is also becoming wiser to the tactics of the politicians.  <br>  <br>  South Africa is still on the right path, it will simply take some time.  Never say die.|`|2UomwjfEaa	Yes, the expats do wish that. Most of them a bitter people who make themselves happy by persauding themselves that there moving away is justified if SA is a horrible place.|`|O5KOwhovaa	It's already like Zimbabwe.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A total mess.
aREreo9laa	I'll put them in this order:<br>  <br>  1. The Grove - Centrally located in the heart of the Westside. Much more to do. Farmers Market offers much to eat. Hollywood is close by. Celebrity Sightings. Near Wilshire. Huge Abercrombie Store!<br>  <br>  2. 3rd Street Promenade - Close to the beach and pier, also is a pleasent walk, but sometimes there can be some awkward weirdo's walking around, comin up from Venice.<br>  <br>  3. Americana at Brand - Very beautiful structures. Not enough to do, and Glendale.... Enough said!|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Wow, tough choice. I would go with the Grove, because you're closer to Farmer's Market and CBS, which have a little history, and where you might spot a celeb.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	The Grove...more to do.|`|aa1212d2112ebf6374db523da2b22064aa	3rd street|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	I would say the Grove as well.|`|lzEuuseJaa	The Grove, mostly because I like the movie theatres and the Barnes & Noble. = )

But Vegas is a party town, first and foremost. Everywhere you go people are drunk and drinking, gambling, and getting wild. Even at the "shows" and restuarants. There are MANY places in this country to see culture and shows, Vegas is generally reserved for people who enjoy a very "adult scene". I guess my point is that some who does enjoy many of these things, may feel a tad uncomfortable.Because even though are may be wholesome things to do, you are always surrounded by the towns vices. My mother in law, who does not drink or gamble ( strict christian ) said she was VERY uncomfortable in Vegas.. and did not have a good time.|`|G0wGbdENaa	probably , these mosques spring up everywhere >:-(|`|Om11iR7waa	I understand that Kosher is acceptable for Halal users.

No state is recession proof today.Talk with your husband about his job and if it too is available then a transfer to Florida will work out.<br>   I personally would move to Florida as a relocation simply because I like the state.But the hardest part of such a relocation is learning about the new state and the new town.Look up the state of Florida web site and look at the info on it , also check out the various vacation and resort locations for further information on the state and areas of the state.But by all means discuss with your husband and the two of you make the plan and ultimately the move.<br>   I moved to Florida when I was 20 and lived there 4 years.Illness in my family moved me to my home state.But i was scareed when I moved there but it was shortly that I was comfortable and enjoyed living there.

Typically its easier to do that then it is to get free tickets|`|siHN027laa	Had the same problem.<br>  I finally gave them to that charity "Last Wish" or something like that.<br>  Figured if I couldn't or didn't want to use them, maybe someone that is dying might get some joy out of them while they are still alive.|`|AA11496012	You do have to plan and be flexible when cashing in your frequent flier miles since there are fewer flights, meaning fewer seats for those cashing in miles.  You should have enough miles for a free trip internationally.  Also find out what alliance your airline is in and see if you can fly their partner airline.|`|bvzJ9hAbaa	The problem here is that everyone always wants to use the miles to go to some incredibly popular place like Hawaii where they usually sell pretty much all the seats and therefore don't have leftovers to fill.<br>  <br>  The solution is to reserve as far ahead as your airline will allow, usually a matter of 48-50 weeks.  Yes, it's a pain to have to plan a trip that far ahead and make it stick, but that's the only way to get freebie seats to popular destinations.  <br>  <br>  If you are going for a long flight, check the difference in points needed between economy free seat and first class free seat.  On Air Canada the first class to Europe only costs 20 or 25% more points than the economy, but the difference in the flight experience is of course out of this world!
2Ltc1dAwaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  If you rely on the city transportation, Mississauga is DEFINITELY not the way to go!  <br>  Its quite out in the outskirts of Toronto, and it is probably 1.5 hours to Toronto by bus, and its just very time consuiming, and the rent is just about as much.  Also, there is very very poor social life in mississauga.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest downtown Toronto, more specifically the following areas:  <br>  <br>  -Annex: is a great area to find apartments, is filled with recent grads, students, and an eclectic group of people. Your walking distance to everything- good pubs, restaurants, GROCERY STORES, drug stores, transportation, and 2 nearby subway stations.  Rent is also very reasonable.  <br>  <br>  -Also, if you are looking for something a little more upscale, you can try the newly developed areas of Toronto such as Liberty Village, Queen and King West or King East.  <br>  Rent is a little more expensive, obviously, but you are still in the midst of all the action  <br>  <br>  -Speaking from experience, another great area to live is in the newly developed condo complexes by the Harborfront, such as Cityplace.  Rent in the condos, if your looking for a one bedroom, is rather reasonable, and you have access to a number of facilities, which means you dont have to spend more money on gym memberships, etc. Also, ALSO! Its right beside UNION station which is a major transportation hub for toronto- has access to  GO trains, Go buses, and the TTC- toronto transit commission (subway system).  <br>  You are close to chinatown- which you have great cheap groceries, and in the summer its a great place to be outdoors by the lake.  <br>  The neighbourhood is close to entertainment district as well as the sporting complexes Rogers Centre, ACC, etc.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, <br>  there is an area in the midtown section at Yonge and Eglinton.   <br>  Thats a great area for working, although it is not as lively as downtown.  Its also on the subway line.  <br>  <br>  To give you more of an idea of where these neighborhoods are located, look at www.ttc.ca (map of the TTC Subway system), or www.toronto.com.  <br>  <br>  If you need help lookin for a good place...you can also check the website <br>  <a href="http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/apa/" rel="nofollow">http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/apa/</a>  <br>  <br>  or www.viewit.ca  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9H28jzwSaa	Yes Mississauga is a fine place to live. The transit is pretty efficient and it also connects with the Toronto Transit making it easier to get downtown if necessary. I would also recommend Etobicoke. It is very close to Mississauga but still considered part of Toronto.|`|4Rh1qQAoaa	Somewhere around Boulevard Ave. <br>  Toronto's a beautiful city--good choice and good luck! =]|`|hKHupeT7aa	Being unemployed is very depressing until I came across this sight which gave me a new light.

You must see the Temple of Literature,You need to do the street walk tour  - the streets are really interesting the way they all have one type of product, like paper street, shoe street, etc , Huc Bridge goes to Ngoc Son Temple.Memorial House is a lovely old restored Chinese house that is worth a look.The Museum of Ethnology is supposed to be excellent. There are several museums, and of course Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum Complex . <br>  <br>  Then you should do the Perfume Pagoda day trip which is fantastic.<br>  <br>  If you go to Halong Bay it is nice to overnight on a Chinese Junk.<br>  <br>  If you are driving north, which is what I gather you should go via Hue and see the Citadel, and if you take a Dragon boat trip down the river you can stop off at different shrines, pagodas and/or mausoleums. There are several to choose from.We opted for those right on the river and they were great.Then drive over the mountain for a great view, to Hoi An which is a really beautiful town. The Japanese Bridge, and all the old Chinese houses, pagoda and meeting houses are all within walking distance.<br>  <br>  Have a look at <a href="http://www.fascinating-travel-destinations.com/travel-to-vietnam.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fascinating-travel-destinatio...</a>|`|LeLZ4sOPaa	Phan Thiet - beaches<br>  Mu Nai - same<br>  Dalat - cooler weather <br>  Hoi Anh - famous place,  buy a suit for cheap.  <br>  Danang and China Beach - say no more<br>  Hue- fascinating.  old culture<br>  Hanoi - Yow!  busy place but again,  fascinating<br>  Sapa - never been there and never will.  <br>  Halong Bay - you can't go to North Vn. without going there.<br>  <br>  Buy a Lonely Planet guide also.

The first time, I came home from work late at night to my house on Big Pine Key.  I was heading up the stairs to my stilt house when I noticed a large 'branch' in my driveway. I went back down to investigate it, and this 'branch' turned out to be an eight foot python.  I would up trapping it in a garbage can (this is a story unto itself).  This snake turned out to be an escaped pet.  The second experience happened on a drive through the 'Loop Road' off Hwy 41 in the everglades.  Great drive, lotsa wildlife, even saw otters.  But as we were driving along, I saw something big moving along the shoulder of the raod.  I stopped the car, hopped out, and went to go see.  Turned out to be a 13-15 foot Burmese Python.  It was HUGE! And as fat around as my upper thigh.  I'd guess it was between 200 and 300 pounds.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	Living in South Fl, and I really have no idea about any python problem.<br>  We need help w killer Africanized bees though, can you switch to that problem?

AA11589437	Nothing to worry about! No special vaccinations, food and water is OK (on the islands drink bottled water, bu it is not dangerous to drink tap water either, just better bottled for the child), and keep in mind that pavements are not the best if you go around with a baby pram with wheels, there may be motorcycles parked on the pavement and such sometimes, but all will be fine, don't worry.<br>  Oh, the MOST important thing: always cover your baby's head with a hat, and use sun cream and don't let her play in the sun naked. I see so many Brits soing this and this really puts their kid in danger of burning and being in danger of cancer later on. She will be fine as long as she wears a hat, stays out of the sun 12-3 p.m., wears a sun cream and plays with clothes on (she will take them off to swim, of course).|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Hey :)<br>  <br>  i went with my little cousions on holiday & they LOVED the plane.<br>  <br>  Make sure her todler sits next to the window because kids find that fun :):)<br>  <br>  From the airport buy lots of puzzles and games to keep them occupied|`|OdFIQYyhaa	go on a air plane or something...get some little toys that he or she likes and let him or her play them on the plane ok.|`|uECSBZodaa	Make sure you have something to repell the mosquitos they're so annoying there.

IUyXLfdKaa	Bargaining is a matter of practice. A lot of practice and a cool nerve.<br>  Bargaining with Chinese shopkeepers is an art, and always remember that they have more experience than you do.<br>  <br>  They generally quote a price as much as five times high. So first of all never quote your price before listening to ask price. When they ask you make a counter offer at least five times lower. Offer and counter-offer, that is how you go through it. Never show too much interest in the article you are bargaining for. Also its always better to take someone who speaks their language, or you will be using a calculator to show them the price.<br>  <br>  Here are few articles that you might find useful.<br>  <a href="http://gochina.about.com/od/shopping/p/Bargaining101.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gochina.about.com/od/shopping/p/B...</a><br>  <a href="http://www99.epinions.com/content_3280707716" rel="nofollow">http://www99.epinions.com/content_328070...</a><br>  <a href="http://china-travel.suite101.com/article.cfm/range_of_bargaining_in_china" rel="nofollow">http://china-travel.suite101.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|bAQJxyHGaa	Bargain is very easy in CHina. When you want to buy something, you just ask him what's the price and cut 30 to 50 percent. If he don't make the deal, just go to another shop. Most of the shopkeeper will ask you back and see the items for you. <br>  <br>  Bargaining is a national pastime in China so you will find that most retailers except for department stores, large shopping malls will be prepared to bargain.<br>  <br>  You should check the import restrictions in your home country as some items may attract tax on arrival in your home country, especially if it is mailed or shipped separately. <br>  Fore more China travel tips, you can visit here:<br>  <a href="http://www.chinatravel.com/facts/china-travel-tips/shopping-in-china.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinatravel.com/facts/china-t...</a>|`|fVWYr0ISaa	well, like the previous person said, you cannot bargain in malls or stores, but you can bargain in markets. <br>  <br>  Bargain does involve a lot of skills. It depends on how much you think the item should be and how much you are willing to pay for the item, you can bargain down to different prices. Of course, the seller won't sell you something without making a profit, rather it is a matter of how much profit they are making from you. <br>  <br>  When I bargain, I usually act like I don't really care about the item even if is something that I really want (remember these people are pros at reading buyers). If the seller say the item is 150RMB, I usually will cut it down to the minimum, e.g. 20 or 30RMB. Of course, the seller will tell you that you are crazy. Ignore them, act like that's how much the item is worth (which is probably is, or even lower). If the seller is not willing to give in, you can either add 5 to 10RMB to what you offered, or by walking away, the latter is rather more efficient because in most cases, they will call you back to making compromises with you. <br>  <br>  Of course, what I stated is just one of the ways you can bargain, there are many different ways. I usually like to bargain down to a price that is right for me, not necessarily the lowest possible price because I think these sellers are not easy at selling these products themselves.|`|TpQdg9jfaa	it depends ... you cannot bargain in fixed price stores .. bt in cheap market places you must .. better to have a local chinese friend with you .. this may help with the language too ..|`|kdjB33lFaa	never be d one to say the price.. let them be d one to bring the price down... if uncontented w/ d price then try to go to another store.

Alot of people like London but I didn't.  English people are nice but London is very crowded, has a repressed atmosphere & to me it felt like a police state.  Lived in Toronto for awhile, again I didn't like it but I was only there in Autumn & Winter.  I thought it was pretty boring for a large city & lacked atmosphere & energy & the people were very conservative (at least in London, UK you get some interesting looking people & personalities).  I loved Montreal & Quebec City though, but  you need to speak French to study there.<br>  <br>  NZ I live in & am from.  Auckland (1.5 million people) & Wellington (300,000 people) have a good night life & there are lots of international students in Auckland, although alot are from Asia.  There is stunning scenery anywhere in NZ & Auckland has 100 beaches in & around it.  It has a mild climate & rains alot in Winter.<br>  <br>  It depends what you're looking for, if you want something more laid back then choose Canada or NZ, but if you want something really busy & a huge city then choose London.  London is less safe though, particularly at night.<br>  <br>  All in all I guess it depends which option is cheaper as some places will charge cheaper student fee's than others.  Bear in mind international students are charged a much higher amount than local people.

xzwZ3lt3aa	I have a friend that works at Diavik base camp on the ice highway every year. It's my understanding there's no roads because it's either lakes or swampy, so they have to wait until January when the ice is thick enough to support all the heavy duty trucks going in. That's the only way to truck in supplies. Whatever doesn't make it through in the winter, has to get flown in on small aircraft.

1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	The most important Jewish fast is on Yom kippur,Yom Kippur is the only fast day decreed in the Bible. Abstaining from the pleasure of food is meant to improve one's ability to focus on repentance. The Yom Kippur fast is a 25-hour fast that begins before sunset on the evening before Yom Kippur and ends after nightfall on the day of Yom Kippur.Spiritual elevation is a pre-requisite for true repentance. One way to achieve spiritual elevation is to abstain from the physical.<br>  Then there are a few more minor fasts<br>   There are five minor fasts on the Jewish calendar. With one exception, these fasts were instituted by the Sages to commemorate some national tragedy. The minor fasts (that is, all fasts except Yom Kippur  and Tisha b'Av) last from dawn to nightfall, and one is permitted to eat breakfast if one arises before sunrise for the purpose of doing so. There is a great deal of leniency in the minor fasts for people who have medical conditions or other difficulties fasting. The date of the fast is moved to Sunday if the specified date falls on Shabbat.<br>  <br>  Three of these five fasts commemorate events leading to the downfall of the first commonwealth and the destruction of the first Temple, which is commemorated by the major fast of Tisha B'Av.<br>  <br>  Following is a list of minor fasts required by Jewish law, their dates, and the events they commemorate:<br>  <br>  The Fast of Gedaliah, Tishri 3, commemorates the killing of the Jewish governor of Judah, a critical event in the downfall of the first commonwealth.<br>  <br>  The Fast of Tevet, Tevet 10, is the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem. It has also been proclaimed a memorial day for the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust.<br>  <br>  The Fast of Esther, Adar 13, commemorates the three days that Esther fasted before approaching King Ahasuerus on behalf of the Jewish people. The fast is connected with Purim. If Adar 13 falls on a Friday or Saturday, it is moved to the preceding Thursday, because it cannot be moved forward a day (it would fall on Purim).<br>  <br>  The Fast of the Firstborn, Nissan 14, is a fast observed only by firstborn males, commemorating the fact that they were saved from the plague of the firstborn in Egypt. It is observed on the day preceding Passover.<br>  <br>  The Fast of Tammuz, Tammuz 17, is the date when the walls of Jerusalem were breached, another major event leading up to the destruction of the First Temple.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	The Pesach observance (Passover) is the memorial of the day God saved Moses and Israel from Egypt and showed that the man/god of Egypt, the Pharaoh was impotent to God's power.<br>  The day before Pesach is the Fast of the Firstborn, a minor fast for all firstborn males, commemorating the fact that the firstborn Jewish males in Egypt were not killed during the final plague. <br>  the evening of the 14th of Nissan in the Hebrew calendar and the 15th is the first day of Passover<br>  <br>  There are many different fasts in Judaism, but Passover, the observance of God's deliverance of all Israel, is not a fast.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm</a> < tells the dates and has great information on it's observance<br>  Now for my own words and some Torah excerpts to support. I hope you will go to read Exodus in entirety.<br>  Jews are required by direct commandment in the Torah to keep the Passover observance for an eternal memorial. Passover ( Pesach in Hebrew) is the celebration of the deliverance of the eternal covenant nation Israel, the Hebrews, from the yolk of idolatry, superstition, and physical slavery in Egypt. It was a reaffirmation of their identity as a nation dedicated to God through Torah and our memorial reaffirms this for each generation. . The events we retell at Passover were demonstration to Egypt that their deities were false and their man/god Pharoah impotent to God's power.<br>  <br>  It is a very important part of Judaism and many central aspects of our identity as an eternal covenant nation are embedded in it's observance. 12:12 I will pass through Egypt on that night, and I will kill every first-born in Egypt, man and beast. I will perform acts of judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I [alone] am God.<br>  That is a very important passage there..NOTE..God will enact judgment against the false gods..plural now..of Egypt. That was the purpose of the Passover sacrifice. <br>  12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are staying. I will see the blood and pass you by (pasach). There will not be any deadly plague among you when I strike Egypt. <br>  <br>  12:27 You must answer, 'It is the Passover service to God. He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, sparing our homes.' <br>  The people bent their heads and prostrated themselves. <br>  <br>  The Passover sacrifice serves to demonstrate the people’s courage, as they take the Egyptians’ object of worship and slaughter and eat it in the service of the God of Israel. Torah is clear that the sacrifice and eating of the lamb at Pesach was the killing and eating of the false god of Egypt to show allegiance to the real God. The continuation of the Paschal lamb sacrifice is an eternal remembrance of that deliverance from idolatry and slavery. This is why no uncircumcised male or Gentile could partake of the Paschal lamb. If Christians wish to honor and observe the Passover for the meanings that are commanded in the Torah, you are welcome to attend any synagogue's community seder. Without the Temple we no longer make the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb and eat it so that command (no gentile may eat of it) is not broken. 12:42 There was a night of vigil for God, [preparing] to bring them out of Egypt. This night remains for the Israelites a vigil to God for all generations<br>  12:43 God said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the law of the Passover sacrifice: <br>  'No outsider may eat it. <br>  12:44 If a man buys a slave for cash and circumcises him, then [the slave] can eat it. <br>  12:45 [But if a gentile is] a temporary resident or a hired hand, he may not eat [the Passover sacrifice]. <br>  12:46 'It must be eaten by a single group. Do not bring any of its meat out of the group. Do not break any of its bones. <br>  12:47 'The entire community of Israel must keep [this ritual]. <br>  12:48 When a proselyte joins you and wants to offer the Passover sacrifice to God, every male [in his household] must be circumcised. He may then join in the observance, and be like a native-born [Israelite]. But no uncircumcised man may eat [the sacrifice]. <br>  12:49 The same law shall apply both for the native-born [Israelite] and for the proselyte who joins you.' <br>  <br>  Now, we have a bone representing the lamb on the plate. I have had non-Jewish friends attend many seders at my home in the past and they find that learning the Torah meaning they've often overlooked is very powerful in its messages. <br>  <br>  the link below is a great source to discover more about Yom Kippur, the major fast<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm</a><br>  <br>  and the other fasts of Judaism<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm</a>|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi. There are alot of fasting days within Judaism. I answered your Passover (Pharoah) question on the other question too.  You are basically asking the same questions so here is same answer. <br>  <br>  If you're considering, as a Gentile, trying to observe Jewish events you need to explore the Gentile's specific role to play as it is assigned within a legitimate Jewish only source. Not all Gentiles participate in all Jewish events just like Jewish people don't participate in other people's religious events. Some, as a Gentile are participative though.  So you'll just have to learn more.  I suggest you learn from reliable site I am about to give you as they are a credible source and I know that there are many many non-credible sources out there, so BEWARE as they will be quick to lead you astray and you won't know you're astray til it's too late. Consider your warning now and save yourself the heartache later. :) Seek only reliable Jewish sources for your info.<br>  <br>  To learn about Jewish events and how they affect Gentiles then one must know the basics, the Noahide Laws. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://noahide.org/" rel="nofollow">http://noahide.org/</a><br>  <br>  If keeping track of Jewish events are important to you (and I agree, I think some of these things are important for Gentiles to know) then try using the Hebrew Calendar and then learn about the Jewish events and how they pertain to Gentiles (from the reliable source I gave you above)  The date shifts from year to year we don't use Gregorian. <br>  <br>  Hebrew Calendar/Date Converter<br>  <a href="http://hebcal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hebcal.com/</a><br>  <br>  Why the Wall is Holy<br>  <a href="http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall_is_Holy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall...</a>|`|e3685f49608aafc5826d78a4417c8ab8aa	there are many communal fast days<br>  tzom gedalyha<br>  yom kippur, asara btevet<br>  shiva asar btammuz<br>  tisha b'av<br>  taanit esther<br>  taanit bechorot<br>  <br>  plus all sorets of private fast days and special ones (like a wedding day)<br>  but while yom kippur is on the 10th of tishrei, the 7th lunar month (nissan is the first), none is about moses' being saved.|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	Next Jewish light fasting day is Ta'anit Esther, which is the day before Purim. Passover is celebrated on 15 Nissan which is on the full moon. This is not a fast day, but we do eat matzo (unleavened bread), which is the "bread of affliction".|`|PAtbjVCoaa	Passover April 9-15|`|luWMdsrOaa	Yom Kippur is probably the most important holiday of the Jewish year. Many Jews who do not observe any other Jewish custom will refrain from work, fast and/or attend synagogue services on this day. Yom Kippur occurs on the 10th day of Tishri. The holiday is instituted at Leviticus 23:26 et seq.<br>  <br>  The name “Yom Kippur” means “Day of Atonement,” and that pretty much explains what the holiday is. It is a day set aside to “afflict the soul,” to atone for the sins of the past year. In Days of Awe, I mentioned the “books” in which G-d inscribes all of our names. On Yom Kippur, the judgment entered in these books is sealed. This day is, essentially, your last appeal, your last chance to change the judgment, to demonstrate your repentance and make amends.<br>  <br>  As I noted in Days of Awe, Yom Kippur atones only for sins between man and G-d, not for sins against another person. To atone for sins against another person, you must first seek reconciliation with that person, righting the wrongs you committed against them if possible. That must all be done before Yom Kippur.<br>  <br>  Yom Kippur is a complete Sabbath; no work can be performed on that day. It is well-known that you are supposed to refrain from eating and drinking (even water) on Yom Kippur. It is a complete, 25-hour fast beginning before sunset on the evening before Yom Kippur and ending after nightfall on the day of Yom Kippur. The Talmud also specifies additional restrictions that are less well-known: washing and bathing, anointing one's body (with cosmetics, deodorants, etc.), wearing leather shoes (Orthodox Jews routinely wear canvas sneakers under their dress clothes on Yom Kippur), and engaging in sexual relations are all prohibited on Yom Kippur.<br>  <br>  As always, any of these restrictions can be lifted where a threat to life or health is involved. In fact, children under the age of nine and women in childbirth (from the time labor begins until three days after birth) are not permitted to fast, even if they want to. Older children and women from the third to the seventh day after childbirth are permitted to fast, but are permitted to break the fast if they feel the need to do so. People with other illnesses should consult a physician and a rabbi for advice.<br>  <br>  Most of the holiday is spent in the synagogue, in prayer. In Orthodox synagogues, services begin early in the morning (8 or 9 AM) and continue until about 3 PM. People then usually go home for an afternoon nap and return around 5 or 6 PM for the afternoon and evening services, which continue until nightfall.

AA11375099	Seattle is nice and now pretty affordable if you have money to buy property.  Homes are discounted due to the economy.  That means people are out of work here.<br>  <br>  Starbucks, Boeing, Microsoft, are just some of the business's laying off workers.  <br>  <br>  Outside of Seattle to those other areas is like small town USA.  Very quiet and peaceful.  You don't have the traffic and everything that goes with being in a big city.<br>  <br>  There was an article in the paper about how people are hard to get to know in Seattle.  And it is true.  Unless you join a group and meet people that way, you could have a hard time making friends.<br>  <br>  So, it is possible your children could find it hard to make friends too.  I  have worked at the same place for decades and have never been invited to anyone's house for dinner.<br>  <br>  My wife has friends because she joined a group and she see's them a lot.  <br>  <br>  If you join a church you may make new friends, and it may be the only way to in a small town like Wenatchee.  Lot's of cowboys and farmers in those surrounding communities.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	I found it to be a friendly city.<br>  <br>  It does have a very high depression and suicde rate though.|`|iaLVRwBnaa	seattle - on the west side of the state. biggest city here. very expensive. very liberal. moderate weather year round.<br>  <br>  ellensburg - located on the east side of the state (the west side and the east side are VERY different). small, college town. big on rodeos and cowboys. all thats really there is a college and fast food and gas stations.. lots of them. it's kind of known as the "pit stop" when you get to that side of the state from the west side on road trips and stuff.<br>  <br>  wenatchee - also on the east side of the state. bigger than ellensburg, and in general is a mid-big sized city, especially for the east side of the state. haven't been over there except for a couple times, but i heard its a nice town. there's a lot of farming outside of the city though. they're big on apple groves and all that stuff over there. <br>  <br>  weather on the eastside of the state is much different than the west side. reason being is that there's a mountain range that you have to cross that "seperates" the 2 sides of the state. it is colder in the wintertime on the eastside and they always get way more snow than the west. but in the summer time the weather is MUCH nicer on the eastside. the sun actually shines over there and it gets pretty hot... in otherwords the generally have a summer over there whereas around seattle it only really gets "hot" a week or 2 during the summer.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	Life in Seattle and Wenatchee/Ellensburg are totally different.<br>  Different sides of the state and the eastern side is definately more conservative than the left side which is where Seattle is.

I guess the schools can be okay and don't have the problems that Detroit's would, but the people are so snobby, inconsiderate, and fake.

You can do a Canopy Tour on zip lines there and play with monkeys and macaws and swim off the beach.

Its a nice place and all, but may not be what your looking for. <br>  <br>  Southport, N.C (near the S.C. line) is quite nice- on the water, with lots of downtown Southern charm. Plus, its near Wilmington, N.C., where there's plently to do (but it still has small town charm, and plenty of water access). I've been there quite a few times, and have always enjoyed it.<br>  <br>  New Bern N.C. is lovely as well.Very historic (it was N.C.'s first capital and has a Royal Governor's palace/museum similar to the one in Williamsburg Va.) and very quaint. I spent a few weeks there last summer and can't wait to visit again.
zBWefnYHaa	It is not the agencies that are illegal, in most countries that is, it is some of the services they might sell.<br>  <br>  It is not illegal to hire a girl or guy to accompany you to a dinner or evening out.<br>  It becomes illegal in many cases if the girl or guy is also offering sexual favors.<br>  Whether it is illegal depends on the laws of the country, the kind of license the company has, what kind of contract the workers have and which age the workers have.<br>  But overall, those laws are almost always nationwide, not different for a single city in a country.<br>  <br>  If you want to have more precise information you will need to give more details. <br>  Which country, what city, what agency and what kind of services.<br>  Now we even have to guess that you aim at Europe, your question could also be posted in the wrong category. (But my answer would still stay the same.)

4qcCsyOzaa	If you are going to work in Taiwan and want a work permit, you will need a company to sponsor you so you can have your work permit. This is because they will need to file tax information for you and to tell the government when your employment is over. To teach English you need at a bare minimal a 2 yr degree and a TESOL/TEFL certificate that is recognized by Taiwan, but most companies will require a 4 year degree in anything. If you apply for a job once you get to Taiwan and are accepted you will need to leave because you can only have one visa at a time, so in order to get your work visa you must exit the country. Going to HK is an easy thing to do, just about an 1hr flight from Taipei no visa required for Americans. <br>  The only thing with this is that Taiwan only issues 1 year work visas and all companies are by law required to issue a minimal 1 year contract. It helps to keep the backpacker teachers who use to come to Taiwan work for a few weeks or months and then leave and not put in any real effort from messing up the education system.<br>  <br>  Now you didn't hear this from me, but it is possible to work under the table. However you really need to be careful about doing this, because if the Taiwan government finds you odds are you will be deported put on a black list and not allowed back for at least a year. I have heard from some other teachers that you can do private tutoring without claiming it to be a job as long as you don't advertise and you tutor more than one person at a time. Mind you I have never tried this and have no idea if this is works or not, but tutoring or working for a friend might be your best bet. <br>  <br>  Just know that if you post a question about working short term, or illegally in Taiwan as a English teacher on any ESL page, serious teachers will flame you and tell you not to do it because as it is things are good for us here, and every time someone causes trouble everybody else feels it after you are gone.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	You need a four year degree and a job offer before you get there.And a work visa.<br>  EDIT:I'm not 100% sure,but in most countries, you need to apply for the work visa before you enter the country.If you happened to find work after you were there, you would have to leave the country,apply,and then re-enter.This is how it is for Japan.You can probably find work there on your own,but you could be deported if someone turned you in.You might want to google "working in Taiwan" and see what comes up.I wouldn't want you to take any chances while you're there.|`|5698c19371c3088c5b5dc78dedafc0a8aa	You can get a work permit upon arrival but you might need to make a visa getaway for a day or two. NOT  a problem as many people make visa runs to HK. Now I read in the papers that a return flight to Macau is only NTD2500/- So you can go away for a weekend. <br>  <br>  Remember as far as Immigration is concerned-You are coming here on a holiday only.|`|fQdfHxB1aa	You can obtain a lot of helpful information on the forumosa.com website.
cfa96832d4bc6849f245fc1b2328aa42aa	You would need to apply at the USA Embassy in London and get an interview for a visa. They do cost more but it is totally possible to get a visa. The interview is for them to assess whether your criminal record is a threat to them!!! <br>  After 9/11 the security has been tight for the States. I have known many customers who have applied and been granted a visa who still have their criminal records but it is not worth chancing going without it. <br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about as I am sure it wont be a problem. <br>  Remember to call in plenty of time as sometimes it can take 2 months before you get an appoinment. Then you have to wait for their decision. <br>  <br>  Keep that in mind. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your course and dont worry|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Yeah of course.<br>  <br>  Even if it was still on your record you could still visit America.

5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Firstly where are you purchasing your ticket from? If it is from a travel agent, you can check with the travel agent for the details of flights, payment methods, whether there is refund if theres any cancellation, how to reconfirm etc. <br>  <br>  If you are booking online, I would recommend that you purchase from the airline website itself. Its safer in a way. Read the rules carefully so that you know what deal you are in for just in case of cancellation/delay. <br>  <br>  Usually when you go to any website that sells air tickets, there should be a schedule for you to check the flight you want. Select the date of travel from your departure airport to the arrival airport and check the button on oneway/round trip. They would then show you the flights available and then stopovers required if it is quite a distance away. There should be a part which allows you to read the rules. If anything, they should also provide you with the contact number to call. So after selecting the flights, they would show the price and then you proceed to pay with your credit card. <br>  <br>  After which, they would allow you to sign in and print the ticket from the website or they would send the ticket to your email address. In the email, they should advise you how to reconfirm the flight.. usually either by calling up a their number or go to the website and follow the procedure within 48hrs of departure. <br>  <br>  After you have follow the procedure, you are ready to fly!
HqQmZfA6aa	Meals are prepared and snap frozen prior to take-off, often uncooked or only partially cooked. They are loaded in carts and when it is time the 'hots' are loaded in the fan-forced ovens and cooked. Then the hots go back in the meal carts onto the prepared trays, usually with a salad, dessert, coffee cup and even a chocolate sometimes. They are then delivered to the passengers. Coffee and tea are brewed on board in special built-in urns.<br>  <br>  In first and business class, meals are prepared similarly except that the quality of the food and presentation is much better than economy. They are not pre-loaded on trays but served individually in a silver service fashion. The meals are very high standard and sometimes even include things like Sevruga caviar and Moet champagne.<br>  <br>  When you think that a jumbo jet holds 450 passengers who receive two meals on a long flight, that's a lot of meals! The galleys are designed well.|`|64IEjXOBaa	They put them into Hot Boxes, which heat them slowly to a specific temperature.|`|FvmrSeqRaa	Everybody here is partially correct, but my answer is the most accurate. A link will be posted after. It depends on what class you fly, if you fly first of business, the meals are professionally prepared by a chef, and later sent to the airport. Until then, they are wrapped and frozen in a fridge. Eventually, the meals are loaded onto the cart you typically see, and are frozen up once again. Once on the aircraft, they are heated up once more and served. <br>  <br>  In economy, if you are flying long-haul where a warm meal is served, it follows the same process. But if you happen to get a meal on a short-haul, the airline just buys products (Candies, Sandwiches) and neatly add them onto a plate, in which the meal is given.<br>  <br>  Check this video out, it's pretty cool:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alh_2xg5GWo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alh_2xg5G...</a>|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Meals are prepared/packaged before they get on the plane. The flight attendants usually just have to heat everything up.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Meals are pre-cooked, so all they require is re-heating.  A microwave will do, as well as a toaster oven.
Qtys8AiTaa	Are you flying to LAX or SFO? If LAX then you will be on Air NZ. If to SFO then most likely you are on a codeshare with Virgin Atlantic. <br>  <br>  If I had the option between BA or Air NZ to LAX then I would choose Air NZ every single time. BA is absolutely fine. But Air NZ's economy seats are very comfortable. I find the Air NZ seats on that run are comfortable, roomy and the food is actually quite decent. <br>  <br>  Air New Zealand by a country mile.|`|3JMfrsMHaa	Air New Zealand is great.

g8LLIeXKaa	How long has the "expired ID" expired? If the "expired ID" is a license, it may be renewed (online, mail, & DMV) if it has been expired for less than two years.<br>  <br>  If it is over two years, you will need to carry all your documents with you to DMV as you will not be able to renew it.<br>  <br>  If the "expired ID" is a non-driver photo ID card, you will have to renew it at DMV as you can not do it by mail or online.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, if you're ID is no more than 60 days over due, you can still renew your card with just your Social Security card. Just go to the New York States DMV website and print out a copy of the DMV renewal application, fill it out and personally take it to the DMV Office. Your new ID card will be mailed to you within 30 days. The form is in PDF format.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|45a8c885a9b24a213fe52c9cba5e4a24aa	Honestly, your best bet is to call your local DMV and ask them what they require. That way you aren't stuck on those horrendous lines for nothing. Good Luck!

I think that covers everything!|`|a7VkyZLfaa	take towels , bathing suits , sunoil and cream after sun ,robes , shorts and comfortable clothes and flipflobs or slippers  , hats to protect your head from the sun and sunglasses . Take water and juices because you will need lots of water if it is hot in there , some caned food as well will be something that maybe need . Wear tennis shoes and jeans , you dont need regualr shoes for the beach. Have fun
AA12016117	Truly amazing, I agree.<br>  <br>  I've been a couple of times some years ago, and feel I'm recharging my batteries by "communing" with the magnificence of nature.  Those magnificent mountains, beautiful wild scenery and deep seas just make you forget the rat race and noise and bustle of the city.<br>  <br>  I loved Dunvegan Castle, where we saw the Fairy Flag.  We stayed in a charming little guesthouse in Portree, and just drove around marvelling at the scenery which changes around every bend in the road, over every rise of hill.<br>  <br>  It was magical going over on the little ferry; I do wish they hadn't built the bridge across - yet more "civilization" encroaching on an area that should stay as unspoilt as possible.<br>  <br>  (I love most of Scotland.)

There's hotel and tourist info on this website..................|`|bb1d785305d9940f30a4ac0ee52a9957aa	It depends on the kind of holiday you plan to have. If you want clubs then go to Rimini or Riccione. The beaches there are abysmal, but it's full of clubs and young people. You go there just for the nightlife, it similar to Lloret de Mar.<br>  If you're after gorgeous beaches, then go to Sardinia. The east coast is the most popular and better developed for tourism. San Teodoro is a good place to go, as there are clubs and the beaches are great. You will need a car and to book in advance (now). Don't go to Costa Smeralda in the North West unless you're a millionaire, a TV presenter or a WAG.<br>  You can also go to Puglia, in Salento (the southern tip of the heel). There in mid August you can go to the Taranta festival, which in the last 10 years has become really popular. People dance and play all night long. It's based on a really old tradition, but it's full of young people dancing, drinking and enjoying themselves. I am planning to go this summer, as many of my friends love it and go there every year. The beaches are gorgeous, too. Sicilia has got good beaches, but I've never been there, so I don't really know where you could go.  <br>  Tuscany, where I'm from, has got some good beaches in Isola d'Elba (Elba Island) and some good clubs. Argentario is really good as well, but posh, too. Not many clubs, but good for relaxing.<br>  In all cases, except if you go to Rimini, you will need a car. That's because the best beaches are not near resorts, but you need a bit of inside knowledge and do some research and your efforts will take you far.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I just re-read your question and realized that for 'girls' you meant your daughters and not your friends. <br>  Don't go to Rimini, Elba would be better. Puglia is good and the Taranta festival is good for families as well. Sardinia is good as well, as I said, try the east coast.

pcHp7Dgkaa	If you're from the US and aged between 18 and 30, a Work and Holiday visa allows you to live and work anywhere in Australia at any type of work for up to 12 months. The only restrictions are that you can only work with each employer for a maximum of 6 months and must be a high school graduate..<br>  <br>  If you're from Canada, the UK or Ireland (and a number of other countries), a Working Holiday visa is much the same, but can be extended to 24 months if you meet certain regional work conditions during the first 12 months.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	There isn't a location in New York State that has snowfall all year round.  I've lived in Buffalo, Albany, Poughkeepsie, Westchester County and I'm from and currently reside in Brooklyn - the worst, in terms of snowfall, was Buffalo, but it even stops snowing there in April (DEFINITELY by May).  If you're looking for all year round snow fall, or at least snow fall that late in the spring, you might want to go for your characters possibly driving in the Poconos or somewhere in Pennsylvania, in the mountains?  I've really only been there in the winter for skiing ... but if you pick a mountainous area, even Vermont in the Killington/Rutland areas ... but it's not going to be snowier and snowier, with less houses.  It would be the same climate in New York until you gradually worked your way into the mountains.<br>  Sorry, but as the guy above me said - it's not Siberia, it's New York and we have lovely weather with all four seasons.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Um.. this isnt Siberia.

Pr3QIlweaa	Here's the main page for this agency: <br>  <br>  Canada: <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html</a>  <br>  <br>  U.S: <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/</a><br>  <br>  Navigate from there.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would ALWAYS encourage anyone travelling to or from the U.S. to refrain from using the words "girlfriend" or "boyfriend" when going through immigration.  That sets off all kinds of red flags.  They're worried you are going to go there and live illegally with your significant other.  (...Which is fair enough...but their actions only encourage the kind of deceit I'm recommending.  Not lying, per se.  Just not divulging every detail of why you're travelling.)<br>  <br>  I dated an American man for 9 years.  The first two were here in Canada, until he moved back to the U.S.  The next two years we travelled back and forth.  And the final years, I lived there half the time, and here half the time...until we broke up.  It only took one or two times at airport immigration to learn that any mention of the word "boyfriend" meant more time being scrutinized, with all kinds of insulting, lame, and sometimes downright offensive questions and comments.  (I'm pretty affluent, so I was surprised that made no real difference to them.  It's tough, sometimes, dealing with someone who I could buy and sell many times over, treating me like a criminal, a liar, or an infant, and I had to just stand there and smile... and take it, if I wanted to see my boyfriend.)  <br>  <br>  (Don't misunderstand...I'm brutally polite and easy-going.  I smile and answer any and all questions without hesitation.  But some of these minimum wage border folks are power-trippers, who seem to delight in giving people a harder time than they need to.  Since I don't do anything illegal, they really have no cause to suspect illegal activity, or anything like that.  As I always say, if I fall into some kind of criminal activity "profile," it's really no profile at all...since I do abosultely nothing wrong.  I.E. I come to a complete stop at all stop signs.  Never speed.  Have never tried illegal drugs.  Etc., etc.)<br>  <br>  I mean, it only takes one or two those experiences to teach you that you just say you're going for pleasure, to do a little shopping and see some sights.  And I can only presume it's the same for Americans travelling to Canada to visit their significant others.  <br>  <br>  Just keep that little bit of information (about the boyfriend/girlfriend) to yourself.  When going through immigration, you're just another Canadian going to the U.S. on vacation (or vice versa).<br>  <br>  Oh, and also be aware that a complaint to border patrol could mean your name is flagged for future border crossings.  ...Just a heads up.  It shouldn't be that way, but we all know how agencies work.|`|bvzJ9hAbaa	I cross the border frequently, and I often get asked odd questions, probably because I usually travel alone.  Last time, the officer asked me my occupation.  When I told him "geography teacher" he spent a couple of minutes working away on his computer, and then out of the blue suddenly asked, "So, what's the capital of Peru?"  I told him it was Lima, and he handed back the passport and said "Have a nice day."  I guess he was verifying that I knew some geography!  Also, they knew that I had crossed more often last summer than I do most years, and they wanted to know why.  My guess would be that the same thing is happening here, they have spotted the pattern of frequent border crossing that has suddenly sprung up and want to know the reason for it.|`|k6u1Kka0aa	Goes both ways.

2o3BHgCCaa	Melbourne was voted the most liveable city in Australia due to its public transport, cultural diversity and entertainment. There are always things to do at any time of day or night.<br>  As far as affordability goes it is on par with most of the east coast cities. Things are becoming more affordable with the economic downturn and the lowering of interest rates, but that is Australia wide.<br>  <br>  At the moment I live in Perth which is just like a big country town really. Crappy public transport, but it has a slower pace than other Austalian cities.|`|qVaaaT7Gaa	melbourne all the way.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	That's really hard to answer, every city has it's pro's and con's. <br>  <br>  North Queensland for instance is prone to the tropical weather in their wet season, so torrential rains, cyclonic winds, flooding, etc.. <br>  <br>  Perth get a little bit of weather issues when they get their heat waves which can bring some bush fires. But mainly it's thier isolation from the rest of the country. Prices are rising to meet the east coast. <br>  <br>  Sydney, while we get great weather, all four seasons, mild and comfortable, we do get a little humidity and prices are pretty hefty. <br>  <br>  Melbourne, best public transport I have ever used. Cold winters, four seasons in one day, unpredictable weather. On par with pricing of Sydney. <br>  <br>  Tasmania, cooler weather, isolated, higher prices for goods due to the need to ship everything. <br>  <br>  Adelaide, lacks the culture, frequent heat waves. Much of a 'still' city. <br>  <br>  Regional Victoria, not just looking at the current fires, but is often prone to bush fire. The heat waves don't help. <br>  <br>  Really it depends what you're after. In search to find a perfect city you will need to take the good with the bad. Perhaps a regional city will suit you. Sticking near the coast will bringer slightly cooler summers. Regional will be a little cheaper, but too rural and you get bush fires again. You lose culture in the smaller cities. <br>  <br>  It's really to hard to answer, I love where I live doesn't mean you will.|`|uKjV9fADaa	I'm Adelaidean, so my vote is for that city. It's cheaper than the others, it has the best dining scene in the country (while Sydney and Melbourne have excellent quality of food, they're much more expensive for the same as Adelaide. This is so true that when I travel overseas, I'm disgusted by the quality vs. price ratio in most countrie - I won't even eat out in France, where I now live). Theres a bigger and I think better cafe scene in Adelaide than even Melbourne - thanks to Italian migrants in the 60s and 70s. There's also the biggest urban food market in australia, again thanks to mediteranean migrants. Half the countries wine comes from here and many argue the best beer also. <br>  The downside is the lack of culture. There isn't much to do there, except during the festival season (Feb to April each year) when it really is the best place to be on earth. The fringe festival is the second biggest in the world, behind Edinburgh. But outside that time, there's virtually nothing to do except drink all that lovely wine. Broadway musicals and rock gigs often miss Adelaide altogether, and most Adelaideans take advantage of discount airline fares to go to Melbourne to see the musicals. Also, there is a large bogan (our equivalent to the chav or redneck)|`|s2IOyj8iaa	All our cities are very livable all are multi cultural.

AA12212523	You need permission to live and work in Canada. It's going to take a while:|`|azypqsphaa	u can't move to Canada, u have to apply for permission to immigrate...|`|rDtl7aGdaa	IT's Not worth it....<br>  <br>  <br>  40 per cent of professional and skilled immigrants leave Canada within 5 years<br>  <br>  Canadian HR Reporter<br>  Feb 10, 2009<br>  <br>  By Shannon Klie<br>  <br>  While Canada does a good job attracting skilled and educated immigrants from around the world, government and businesses need to do a better job of keeping them once they get here, says a professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.<br>  <br>  "We spend a fair amount of time and discussion on attracting immigrants, but we don't spend that much time on talking about retaining them. It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said. "We have to do a better job of receiving that talent

bb1d785305d9940f30a4ac0ee52a9957aa	The school year begins in mid-late September, depending on the region (it starts earlier in the north and later in the south for weather reasons). In Tuscany it's usually between 15th and 23rd September. Then you get 1st November (All Saints) as a bank holiday and then 8th December (Mary's immaculate Conception or something like that). Christmas holidays usually start around 22nd December and finish after 6th January (Befana). Then you get 5 days around Easter, usually from the Thursday before Easter until the Tuesday after it. 25th April (Liberazione=end of WWII) and 1st May (Labour Day) are holidays too. I cannot remember if 2nd June (Republic's Day) is holiday for schools now, I think so, as they introduced it after I finished school. Summer holidays start in the second week of June and last for three long, hot and amazing months!!! You have to do some homework, usually kids (me included at the time) do everything in the last couple of weeks, but it's amazing anyway!

And many Quebecers in the larger cities (Montreal, Quebec City) and in the tourist areas are bilingual (French/English).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Most people there speak French, yes. But most are bilingual and also speak English.<br>  <br>  And if you're asking if they are French, as in, "from France" - no. They are French-Canadian.

keGOvavbaa	The answer depends on whether the fare you purchased allows free same-day standby or not.  Most fares and airlines do allow it, but some do not (especially on international flights).<br>  <br>  The only way you're going to get a definitive answer to your question, since the answer is dependent upon your specific fare, is to call US Airways directly to ask them.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Sometimes there will be no charge if you take a different flight when you make changes at the gate (vs. the ticket counter). To increase your chances of getting on standby, call the airlines prior to arrival to find out if the flight is at capacity. Be sure to get to the gate as early as possible and ask them to put you on the standby list.|`|AA11496012	I would talk to someone either at the ticket counter or call customer service.  Normally the airline would charge you to change but if for some reason your flight is overbooked, they may be willing to change your itinerary for free if the 2PM flight is not full.|`|1f53d307e103593725c9ad616aeeaca1aa	The answer is no. That's because US air charges more for nonstop flights, which you probably noticed when choosing to take the connection. Another reason is that even if the first leg had empty seats, they cannot confirm you on the connection. The only way they would let you take the nonstop (and this has happened to me) is if your flight is delayed and it doesn't look like you'd make your connection.|`|fWi18dyoaa	They may or may not let you change the flight.  One experience I just had with US Airways is that they are now<br>  charging $25 for each bag you check in.  I think that is outrageous.  They should at least let you check in one bag free.|`|7toznquyaa	It's likely that the non-stop flight is more expensive than the one you chose.  If that is the case, they will  not put you one that flight free of charge.

5dWLIicYaa	try looking at the internet for last minute deals....coz airlines mostly hike their prices as the date/time of departure comes nearer....so mostly will be difficult....but not impossible.....hope this helps...!!|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Buying flights at the last minute will usually be allot more expensive than buying them in advance. Try to purchase as early as you can to get the best deal. You will notice on internet sites that the prices for the same flights gradually increase as the date gets closer.|`|bvzJ9hAbaa	The question of price, whether ahead of time or last minute, depends entirely on how full the flight will be.  If the airline can sell all the tickets ahead of time to businessmen paying full fare, they are not going to discount any seats.  The best way to get an idea is to spend a couple of hours doing some online research -- just pretend you are flying tomorrow.  Then ask all the wholesale websites and also the actual airline websites what the rates will be.  Do this for the same day of the week you plan to fly on.  And you can basically forget about finding cheap seats on Friday, Sunday, Monday, as those are usually the busiest days for business travel.

I also had a friend that was a pilot on the submarine.  <br>  <br>  This is one of Barbados's main attractions. I am glad that you have good reviews of the submarine.

bvzJ9hAbaa	Yes, but as it was only a 1-hour flight it was no big deal -- they warned us 10 minutes before boarding, and there was a panic dash to the terminal washrooms.  What's fun is when a commuter airline uses an aircraft type with no washroom.  There was no end of controversy in the media when the old Canadian Airlines started mixing in Jetstream 31 prop planes with 737 jets on flights from Ottawa to London Ontario.  The little Jetstream had no lavatory, and they airline finally got rubber stamps to put on the boarding passes, "No Washroom on Aircraft"!|`|0fygxRHLaa	the lav?  or the loo?|`|RuFZABFxaa	Heh, I heard once that a lady flushed while sitting on it and she got stuck from the suction!<br>  <br>  (Ya know they're arguing about whether or not obese people can get two seats for the price of one if they have a doctor's note.

Il0QA1Hcaa	It depends on your card you have. Do you get charged a fee for using debit then use credit. Either way the charges should appear on a statement. With debit the money is taken directly out and if there is a problem with the amount you have to go through the bank and then through the company who over charged you. If you use credit depending on the provider you can dispute the charges until it is fixed. If you have the cash then put it on your charge and pay it off when it comes in so you will have no interest payments.
HqQmZfA6aa	They differ in degree. Terrorist/hijack is a life and death affair where access to the flight deck is to be stopped at all costs. Any such deliberate attempt is dealt with in any way possible, including killing the terrorist hijacker.<br>  <br>  Unruly passengers are like trouble makers in a pub except the consequences (safety at 40,000 feet!) are different. Alcohol and low oxygen levels in the cabin air don't go well together. Crew use verbal persuasion of an escalating scale as required until the passenger understands that if they don't sit down and be quiet they can and will be met at the other end by police, arrested and charged with air piracy.<br>  <br>  If necessary, physical can and will be used, leading to the passenger being handcuffed and ankle-cuffed until arrival. Not pleasant.<br>  <br>  These days a lot of flights have air marshals on board, armed. Even the crew don't know who they are. There a last resort against terrorists/hijackers and will rarely if ever get involved in cases of unruly passengers.<br>  <br>  The law is VERY heavy when it comes to misbehaving on a plane, so don't even go there.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, here how to get from Penn Station to Nassau Coliseum.<br>  <br>  Step 1: take the LIRR's Hempstead Branch from Penn Station to Hempstead. The fare on the LIRR from Penn Station to Hempstead will cost you $8.50 peak (going to Hempstead during rush hour) and $6.25 off peak (returning to Penn Station). Purchase your ticket before boarding.<br>  <br>  Step 2: once at the Hempstead Station, walk one block to the Hempstead Bus Terminal. Take either the N70, N71, or N72, which will drop you off on Hempstead Turnpike opposite the Nassau Coliseum.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Kat Woman, the Woodbury Common Shopping Center is a good place to go and shop. However, the outlet center is located 47 miles (75km) northwest of Midtown, Manhattan, and a taxi ride from West 57th Street to the outlet center will cost you almost $120 each way.<br>  <br>  There are 2 ways get there from West 57th Street.<br>  <br>  Option 1: Bus<br>  <br>  You can take either Gray Line New York or Short Line Bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to Woodbury Common. Both bus companies get you there and back in about 2 hours for a very reasonable price. I've include the link to both companies below.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.coachusa.com/newyorksightseeing/booking.asp?action=ProductDetail&productId=1062" rel="nofollow">https://www.coachusa.com/newyorksightsee...</a> (Gray Line New York)<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.coachusa.com/shortline/booking.asp?action=ProductDetail&productId=1985" rel="nofollow">https://www.coachusa.com/shortline/booki...</a> (Short Line Bus)<br>  <br>  Option 2: Train.<br>  <br>  If you preferred to take the train. You can take NJ Transit from Penn Station to Harriman via Secaucus Junction. A shuttle bus will wait for you at Harriman station to take you form there to the outlet center.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy shopping.|`|AA11536773	If you're staying in Manhattan, a taxi to Woodbury Commons will cost you a small fortune. It's about 50 miles north of the city. It might be more cost effective to rent a car for the day - even with gas and tolls. (It's exit 16 off I-87 North.) A more reasonably priced option is to take a bus. Coach USA runs several buses all day long. (www.coachusa.com) They go from Port Authority right into the Commons. There are trains that run north, but it's a hassle with the PATH into Hoboken, then NJ Transit north to the Harriman train station and then a cab to the Commons. <br>  <br>  As far as it being "worth a visit". It depends. If you have an open mind and are willing to browse a bit, you can pick up some good deals. But, if you have a specific item in mind that you're shopping for, you probably will not find it. Some of the outlets carry "seconds" - meaning the items are not perfect for firsts - the dye lot is half a shade different or something like that. Some sell last season's leftovers from the department stores. Many sell the same things as the current department stores - their buyers are allowed to go in the day after the department stores do. So, if you want to wander around and see what's available, it's a good day trip.|`|AA10032302	It a little more than an hour's drive outside the city.  You wouldn't be able to take a cab.  You could probably find a bus that will take you out there.  To be honest if you are visiting the city, I wouldn't bother going out there.  It is pretty nice, you can find some good deals there for sure, just like any other outlet mall.  You will get your fill of shopping here in the city.|`|T497f0iwaa	I would not waste time visiting Woodbury Commons.  It's a depressing little shopping mall, I believe it's in New Jersey.  You have to take a weird bus to get there.  I would definitely not go!!<br>  <br>  Shop at Macy's instead.  There are great bargains there!|`|paerqxfMaa	Take the train.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	A taxi would cost probably 100-150$ each way. Its a good hour drive out of the city.<br>  <br>  I would check into Metro North Trains. The hudson line probably has a station with a very short taxi drive, or possibly even walk of the outlet mall. Catch the train right at grand central.<br>  <br>  Its worth a visit only if shopping is very important to you. If you have been to outlet malls before, this is nothing special.

AA12086491	You could look at Maine, do some hiking in Baxter State Park, then spend a few days in Acadia National Park.  New Hampshire has great hikes in the White Mountains, same with Vermont.  There is a great book called "New England Seacoast Adventures" by Stephen Jermanok that has company and location listings for backpacking, camping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, biking, rock climbing, seakayaking and so many other activities.  The coast is where most of the activities are in this area, inland you generally just find hiking.|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Have you done wild wood in NJ. Tons of activities as well as beaches.

AA12129792	If you're fairly fit then taking one of the established routes such as the Pyg Track or Miner's track would be strenuous but achievable.<br>  <br>  Depending upon the route it will take about 4 hours or so - remember to allow plenty of time to get back down before dark, and make sure you have some warm clothes and energy food as it gets MUCH colder and windier at the top.<br>  <br>  This site has some details of the routes.|`|jUjkvis8aa	There are many ways of getting up Snowdon, some harder than others. Possibly the most tourist/novice-friendly is the PYG track as there are no particularly steep or rocky parts. It can take anywhere between 2 hours and 7 hours to climb up Snowdon, depending on your speed. And of course, there's the going down bit aswell! Your climb will take you a whole day.<br>   No, you do not have to be a fitness freak to do it. Just get a bit of practice of going up mountains beforehand by climbing up local hills. It's very achievable! <br>  p.s bring some food, the cafe isn't open yet!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|AA10310496	Our school had a camping holiday in Snowdonia way back in the 60's, and we all went up Snowdon and we found it pretty easy but I have no idea what path we took.<br>  <br>  I was in the team that was on cook duty that day and, along with another member of our team, had to get back to camp before the others so that we could get the kettles on, and start heating up the food that had been prepared before we left.  We hotfooted it at a quick pace back to the site and spent ages hunting for the matches...couldn't find them anywhere.  To our disgust the rest of the group turned up a short while later having been given a lift on the back of trailer by the farmer who owned the field we were camping in.

This is the biggest danger. (2 people died on snowdon in the bad weather a couple of weeks ago.)<br>  <br>  If you are reasonably fit then you can give it a go. How long it will take will depend which route you take and how quickly you walk but always allow more time than you think you will need.<br>  <br>  This can be a very good interest and Snowdon is a good place to start out and cut your teeth.|`|NePxlTnZaa	Snowdon is not a particularly difficult climb at all. Ok it's not a Sunday morning walk in the park but depending on which route you take isn't full on mountaineering either.<br>  <br>  The easiest route, with a well made path right to the top, is the Llanberis path, which I can walk in under two hours.<br>  <br>  Dress appropriately.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	I have done twice.

If he had sex with her teacher six times already, I wonder what kind of "boy" he is.  A "big boy"? Or a "stupid boy"?  Punish the teacher alone?  How could it be fair?  However, it all depends on the established law of the land.  The safest  thing to do is "when you are in Rome, do what the Romans do".  If you don't want or can't do it, if you are a fforeigner then go back home!|`|GTAKIE9kaa	not really, i think if she is not a teacher, nobody will care. as teacher had the responsible to impart knowledge on the younger generation. so she should know not to get into this kind of relationship.|`|AA10535892	reading all your answers, I'd say the boy had the time of his life and was not in the least bit complaining !<br>  assuming this I can't see how the punishment on the teacher is going to give him a positive view on his treatment of women and could only be negative for his future treatment towards women !<br>  was the teacher at fault probably yes was the boy at fault probably yes :- if he is old enough to get it up and partake then he should be old enough to take responsibility ! <br>  assuming the teacher was a women was the boys name really Anthony or was it, Well ???<br>  exactly what subject was the boy studying? my how school must of changed ?|`|0pUsMhQBaa	justice done and she got only 10 months jail sentence but the<br>  damaged done will be with her for the rest of of her natural life.<br>  <br>  Society will looked down on her, a sad case indeed.<br>  <br>  Love is blind?

Male teacher, female student.  Would you feel the same way?  The female student should be responsible too, right?  Because they had sex six times and the female student had free will and all that, right?  I don't quite get your argument, but it sounds a little sexist to me, unless you'd feel the same were the roles reversed.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the person in a position of power over the other is held responsible.  And as laws protecting children are getting stronger all the time, that law probably won't go away.  Whether or not it should I can't say, but I generally don't think it's ok to blame statutory rape victims.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, men can and do get victimized too.  The reason you don't hear about it is because they never report it for fear of being ridiculed.  <br>  <br>  I don't know about threatening, though.  That may change things.|`|SZbAkEbXaa	It is based upon the premise that a "boy" is not responsible for his actions until he becomes an adult. The same holds true for a "girl". The teacher, on the other hand, is an adult, therefore, totally responsible for her own actions.

eD7qRBKHaa	Disney World does have four parks.  For a 3-year-old, definitely Magic Kingdom should be on the top of the list.  You can probably spend at least 2 days here, maybe 3.  There are lots of rides that cater to very young children.<br>  <br>  Second choice - Animal Kingdom would be a possible option if your daughter could stand and watch animals.  There are a couple of rides she could do, but it would be more like a zoo experience.  <br>  <br>  Or Hollywood Studios.  There are quite a few rides and shows she would like here.  Epcot is probably too advanced for her.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest looking at <a href="http://www.allearsnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allearsnet.com</a>  They have a list of everything at every park, so that will help you to pick.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Magic Kingdom is the best for her age, they have a special section for little children and the whole park is magical.<br>  <br>  Epcot has a thing where you get a starter card and she can get things to complete it at all the areas.<br>  <br>  Tripadvisor.com is a great free site for more info. on WDW. The Orlando area will get to the people who know.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Magic Kingdom definitely. It is tailored to the young audience. for a second, I believe Animal Kingdom would be nice for her|`|0WASp0bHaa	The Magic Kingdom would be best. It has Toon Town and the Cinderella Castle. <br>  Hollywood Studio would be my next choice. Not a lot of rides, but lots of fun shows for her age.|`|AA11349881	Magic Kingdom|`|tnznR01paa	Magic Kingdom:).<br>  It's the best for little kids, though it's still one of my favorite parks, aha.|`|73ac745efcfce839836e14b0f116395baa	Definitly either Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom.<br>  <br>  At Magic Kingdom, they have the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique. This is where little girls(your daughter) can go and dress up as a princess, like Bella, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. This does have an extra price, but it's well worth it for your daughter. She can also meet the princesses. That's always a thrill. Also, there's Mickey's Toon Town Fair, where she can go to Mickey and Minnie's "house" and meet all the characters. She'll get a kick out of that:)<br>  <br>  At Animal Kingdom, they have Camp Minnie-Mickey. She can meet Minnie and Mickey, and get their autographs :) Also, there's cute shows, like It's Tough to be a Bug, The Lion King Festival, and Finding Nemo's show. Also, you can meet Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, and Piglet! It's always fun to meet the characters.<br>  <br>  Definitly don't pick Epcot. It is really advanced, with all of the "future" stuff, like the countries. She won't have a clue about that.<br>  <br>  She may not even know where she is, but she'll sure have fun meeting the characters!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a safe and MAGICAL trip (;|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	Magic Kingdom<br>  Its the best and main park, it has everything.. the castle!<br>  great rides like peter pan, its a small world, etc.<br>  theres alot of great rides for children there. im 15 yrs old and i love it!! <br>  I hope you have a great time!<br>  Ohh and another park, there is SeaWorld, if she is interested in looking at animals, MGM is a great park, Animal Kingdom, and Epcot <br>  I would suggest Magic Kingdom, and SeaWorld<br>  Magic Kingdom is what you should do. they have shows hourly, and some parades, princess stuff too!<br>  Have fun! And hope she has a great time|`|OugNf0x6aa	For a 3 year old, I would think the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. Both of the parks offer the greatest selection of family attractions, especially MK. EPCOT and Hollywood Studios are more geared towards teens and adults than families. ?|`|yWi0gWiBaa	the magic kingdom would be the best because thats where all the princesses and everything are.  and the animal kingdom would probably be second best because of the entertainment from the animals and everything|`|AA11489169	Magic Kingdom is 1st, followed by I'd say Disney Hollywood Studios for the Playhouse Disney Live show! My DD was about 3 when she saw it and I thought she'd NEVER stop talking about it. AMAZING!!|`|Ukh1zQhbaa	magic kingdom and hollywood studios magic kingdom has many kiddie rides and hollywood studios has some great kid shows|`|SdDoOMnBaa	I suggest Magic Kingdom. That is good for all kids. Other wise Animal Kingdom if she really likes animals. I hope you have a great trip.|`|AkGbYsU7aa	Probably Magic Kingdom!<br>  I think the younger kids, older kids, and even adults enjoy this park the most because there is a wide variety of things to do. <br>  If she likes princesses, there is Cinderella's castle. If she likes all the characters, you can find them there. Also another that younger kids enjoy is Animal Kingdom. Idon't know if she's a big animal lover, but there is DEFINITELY something to do with animals there :)<br>  Hope i helped!

They don't feel European--and why would they? The islands of Britain have been split off from the mainland for over  8000 years. They've also heard some of Brussels' silly rules and dictates and mistrust a central European government.plus a lot of countries said prices went up when they switched from their currency to the Euro which makes them mistrustful.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Because I don't want to learn a new currency.
EOZsYlZkaa	Yes, and apparently it has already started. The unemployment rate has increased drastically in recent months and poverty (especially in the interior) is on the rise. The government is quite worried about this, as the rebellions in China that led to the Mao Tse Tung regime began in the interior of China and spread. Because the world's economy is in such a mess, fewer manufacturing contracts are being awarded to China. There's an article in the today's New York Times.|`|l0U5k26Jaa	No, they will help in many way to make it stronger. What will eventually happen is that due to Chinas business success the countries exchange rate will alter and the cost of buying Chinese goods will increase making it less competative. That will take a long time though.

Do a search on Sedona Weddings and i'm sure you will find places that can put a great wedding together for you two|`|wAl9knNzaa	I attended one at the Red Rocks Church it was beautiful and it was a lot of fun, this wedding was horrendously expensive...like $30,000 or more...but I think the bride's dress was a major part of that expense.

UMIWCzMdaa	The Taj Mahal one of the most enchanting place in Agra, even one of the most beautiful place in the world.|`|cWuumdy7aa	The Taj Mahal  located in Agra, India, built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. is one of the seven wonders of the modern world<br>  <br>  The Taj Mahal (also "the Taj") is considered the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Persian, Ottoman, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was cited as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."<br>  <br>  While the white domed marble mausoleum is its most familiar component, the Taj Mahal is actually an integrated complex of structures. Building began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, and employed thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The Persian architect, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri is generally considered to be the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.|`|ZmikGFTEaa	An awesome place to see.. Taj mahal will be one memorable experience and especially in the night they have light show and that is spectacular..
AA10368727	Typically you will pay ONE fee per bag, per direction, especially if the United and US Airways flight are code-shared (ie, you're ticketed on the same airline on the same ticket, but one segment is operated by the other airline).<br>  <br>  There are some instances where changing airlines will require an additional bag fee.<br>  <br>  By the way, Southwest Airlines does not charge any bag fees.   Just thought you'd like to know.|`|Df7k9bgVaa	I am pretty sure that you don't have to.  They typically go by the rules of the first airline you fly with.  They usually just transfer your luggage over from plane to plane and therefore you don't have to check it multiple times and therefore don't pay more than once.  Of course if you are staying overnight in a place you have a layover and retrieve your luggage before continuing on your journey you would have to check the luggage again and therefore have to pay again.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	No, you will only have to pay the fee once on United.  But, if you have to re-check your bags with US Airways, you may be subject to a second $15 fee.|`|gdW8rZt8aa	I watched that airline show, and they did not care if you got layed over or not, they said it is not their fault, so they made people pay for whatever.  You might want to call the airline and find out.  More than likey yes.|`|7toznquyaa	No,  your bags should be put thru to your destination, so you won't have to pay additional fees.  Same with the return.  You pay the $15 for  round trip, unless you booked each layover seperately.<br>  <br>  I just flew from Bahamas to Phila and then on to NY and back.. I paid only $15 ..one time.  I had a 5 hour layover in Philly.

You could be qualified and better than someone, but if they know the boss they get the job.<br>  <br>  I had three jobs here at one point and I hated it.  The cost of living is HIGH.  You have to have a lot of roommates and it is extremely dangerous here, I was robbed, and so was a friend of mine.  It is only 20 minutes from Tijuana, one of the most corrupt places in Mexico.<br>  <br>  The demographic is mostly illegal aliens and 20 somethings.  It is also full of transients from Europe looking to scam people or rob people.  To be 100 percent honest I met a surfer in SD who I initially thought was "mentally challenged," but he was just from SD-seriously.<br>  <br>  It is a huge party scene, lots of fake people, looking to impress anyone they can due to low self esteem.  The only thing it has going for it is the weather, which is almost always 70 and sunny, very little rain.  However, the terrain is barren and ugly, lots of brown dirt and ugly plants.  The beach towns are really trashy and dirty, not a place to raise kids.<br>  <br>  I would try San Francisco or northern California.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|m2eHPeciaa	- very expensive to live here<br>  - weather is great, always around 70-75<br>  - work: your gonna have to commute, its VERY hard to find a job where u live.<br>  - night life: really isn't that great, i'd go up to LA<br>  <br>  also, the city of San Diego is very small.

Cuba is not a cheap destination..........more mid range. The accommodation, food and drinks can add up. Havana is best just to walk around and see the sights.Then you really get the feel of the place, the people and the culture.<br>  <br>  I assume you are going to Varadero? This is really very "unCuba" like compared to the rest of Cuba.Or does your trip actually travel through the country like Intrepid or one of those? Trinidad is lovely........but further away. <br>  <br>  Not knowing the nature of your inclusive trip it is a little difficult to answer.|`|KHXO5LPpaa	Hey my family are cuban so i dont take much spending money with me as i stay with family when i go i'd think for 2 weeks about ￡500-￡600 is fair it just depends what your planning on doing|`|c5ec3f17461cb30d3d9d0c83ea690fb5aa	Ive just come back from Cuban all inclusive and it i possible to spend next to nothing. however I advise you get out of teh complex and see teh real Cuba and meet teh real people. ￡800 is easily enough to live liek a king in Cuba. Aviod spending in teh Old Town Havana as it gets expensive. Check out Santiago de Cuba and Trinidad, just as beautiful but less of a tourist rip off.<br>  And Elizabet, I did look behid te curtain as there is very little put on show just for the tourist, its easy to see teh poverty there. but i saw no street children with Coe habits. No old people wasting away waiting to die. No kids scavenging on rubbish tips. All these things Ive seen in other S American countries, sure its a dctatorship, but the USA supported dictatorships in Argentina, Chilie, Niguaragua, El Salvador , panema, Boliva, Columbia the list goes on , all far worse than the bearded fool who is buggering up the Cuban economy.<br>  Oh No Ive jsut done what i hate, turn a travel question into a political rant.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	I went to Cayo coco which cost about $800.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	You cannot just move to the United States.  To move here legally you must apply to immigrate at the U.S. Embassy. You must meet all the qualifications, and if accepted your name goes on a waiting list. At the present time there are so many Brits wanting to immigrate here that if you would be able to get on the waiting list today it would be 5 years before your turn came up. <br>  <br>  The United States in in a deep recession. 1 in 11 Americans are out of work and looking for a job. Even if your family was issued permission to immigrate,  at the present time no one in your family could get a work visa. You wouldn't be able to support yourselves, and the ability to support yourself is one of the requirements to immigrate. Sorry, but it looks like you're going to be stuck in the U.K. for a while.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	And why do you want to move to the USA? Plus, it's not as simple as moving.

I would live in the UK if I had the chance.|`|lzEuuseJaa	It would be really difficult for your parents to get green cards or work visas to be able to move to the US. Most brits I know who moved to the US worked for large US companies in the UK and were transferred to a US office of the company, so the company sponsored their move. Also, the economy is really bad in the US, especially LA. It would be almost impossible for your parents to find work. Look at the LA Times - <a href="http://www.latimes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/</a> Search: Layoff on their website.<br>  <br>  That is really sad that your bf is moving to Australia. = (  Maybe you can go visit her on holiday soon? <br>  <br>  Has anyone spoken to you about some sun/light therapy for SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)? It sounds like maybe something you might look into. I understand, I can't stand when it's dark and dreary and we don't get too much of that here. Although, today it is dark at 11am and rainy here. <br>  <br>  I'm guessing you're a teen, so you can start planning now if you think you might want to move out here when you're an adult. You can look into university programs in the US, working for companies that are based in the US, or based in the UK with US offices, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	We get this question in this forum from selfish kids who get it in their heads that California is some magical place where there are no problems, the weather is always perfect, and they have a chance to meet a celebrity or become one. They just don't think it through. Do you realize what you are asking your parents to do?<br>  -Give up their jobs<br>  -Give up their friends<br>  -Move to a MUCH more expensive location. Did you ever stop to think how much it cost to live here? The average home price is $400K, which means your mortgage would be about $2,800. Renting a 3 BR home would be about $2500-$3000 in a decent area. Try asking your parents how much they pay in rent or mortgage each month.<br>  <br>  Sure, it's great out here. But asking us to come up with reasons that will magically convince your folks to move out here is unrealistic and selfish. Give your parents some credit. Maybe they cannot afford it, and don't want to admit it to you. Wouldn't it be terrible if you moved out here, tried to make it work, then lost your home and had to live out in the streets? Count your blessings.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're not happy where you are living. However, you need to keep things in perspective. None of us are entitled to wealth, priviledge, or entertainment. Secondly, the best cure for being depresseed is to devote your energies to something other than yourself. Surely there must be some place where you can volunteer your time and energies to make the world a better place. When you do that, you'll find that you'll feel much better.<br>  <br>  Neither LA nor the US is the answer.

Our school district (HEB) is in the top 4 in the state.  Euless has a great set of parks with several miles of walking trails, a fishing pier, a dog park, and great places to play.  Euless also has housing for all price ranges.  There are several Baptist churches in the area, large and small.  Most have gone to the more contemporary style instead of traditional, but some still offer traditional services.  Good luck, and welcome to the area!  Feel free to email me with any questions.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	I'm not familiar enough with FW to give any advice on neighborhoods.<br>  Texas is Baptist country so you'll have an abundance of churches to pick from to find one that suits your family's needs. We lived in Irving for several  years and I taught school there, before moving to south Grand Prairie, which is mid way between FW & Irving, and might be a good location for your family.  Las Colinas, which is what the northern part of Irving is called, is very nice but south of Hwy 183 has really become run down. There are a lot of lakes in the area.  An especially nice one is Joe Pool Lake at Cedar Hill State Park. It offers boating, fishing, swimming area, playground, picnic tables/grills, pavilions and furnished cabins complete with A/C, linens, cookware, dishes, -- you just bring your food. FW has a very nice zoo your kids might enjoy, and another place you may want to go is to Glen Rose about an hour from here.  There are several dinosaur tracks in the Brazos River bed that can be plainly seen when the water is low. Call to check on water level before you go. 254-897-4588  In addition to exploring the tracks you can picnic, fish, swim in river, hike, mountain bike, & camp.

There is also River Oaks which is right next to the base, but a quiet older city.  Azle is right on Eagle Mountain Lake, Possum kingdom is about an hour west, but I wouldn't buy or rent there till you have seen it, as some sales right now are questionable.

94b8KImYaa	For jobs on cruise ships you need more of practical work experience in the department you want to go for on a ship, than a college degree. <br>  So even if you have a college degree in Hospitality and not worked in a Hotel - there will not be much of a chance that you get a job there. <br>  <br>  There are 3 main departments on a ship: Deck, Engine and Hotel. <br>  e.g. in the Deck Department you find AB's (Able bodies Seaman) and you need no college degree for that. Carpenters - you need to be a Carpenter. Deck Officers (you need to be a certified Officer, after attending nautical school and have worked before on cargo ships, before you get to be on a cruise ship) <br>  <br>  Since there are plenty of different jobs onboard a cruise ship, what you have in mind ? Which department ? Reception, Kitchen, Restaurant, Housekeeping, Spa, Shops, Casino, Purser's Department ?|`|I4KqAZThaa	You can easily get a job on a cruise ship if you study courses such as:<br>  culinary courses, sales or marketing in the shipping industry, hotel management, public relations, etc.<br>  <br>  Cruise liners basically require you to have excellent social skills.<br>  <br>  You can also ask various cruise companies what kind of professionals they are looking to hire.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Um, I don't think taking your home town prices and multiplying them by 5 is the way to go, as one answerer suggested - if you live in California, actually, that would be a horrible idea.<br>  <br>  You can shop at discount stores like Century 21 and Daffy's - they both have designer clothes at discounted prices (sort of like a TJMaxx or Marshall's, but a lot nicer and organized).  Rather than wasting money on Fashion Ave., you could visit the malls in Brooklyn or Queens, as well.  Honestly, I find MUCH better deals at the Macy's in Kings Plaza (biggest mall in Brooklyn) than at the one on 34th in Manhattan.  Queens Center, in Queens, is also pretty big with fewer crowds and lots of stores.  BUT, if you are content on staying in Manhattan, I would suggest visiting the stores in Herald Sq. (34th and Broadway) - there's a Macy's, H&M, Forever 21, Victoria's Secret, etc. - they're all very large stores, they offer a lot of choices that you might not find at the smaller, townie stores in the rest of the state/country, and though it's a little pricier, it's still affordable.  I'd bring between $200 and $500, depending on what your preferences are and what you'd like to purchase.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|pTLcvsVfaa	NYC is terrible expensive.

When you are visiting the islands all you need is your ship pass and that will be given to you on the ship.  You will need this in order to get back on the ship as well as when you are entering the different ports. As of June 1, 2009 you will need a passport so should start getting one now.|`|ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	The best answer is that you should have a passport whenever you leave the USA, whether by land, sea or air.  Click on the USA image at <a href="http://www.getyouhome.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.getyouhome.gov/</a> to see the rules; go to <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/passport</a> for form and direction to apply for your passport.  (Generally, you'll have your passport within 3 weeks and it'll put you out $100.)  Also check into the low-cost passport card, which many cruise lines will accept for your Caribbean voyages.  <br>  <br>  By the letter of the law, you don't NEED passport, but having one can make your trip a lot more fun!  Without a passport, the cruise company can, in its discretion, choose not to board you (so be sure you check with your line in case you decide to go this route). Also, if you don't have a passport, any ports of call (Trinidad, Barbados, French West Indies come to mind) that DO require passports won't let you in.  This means you'll have to sit on the boat while all the passport holders are out having fun. <br>  <br>  The choice is yours.
AA12074269	There is a train that goes from T1 to T2 - its one station. much quicker than lining up for a taxi.<br>  <br>  BUT do you have to recheck your bags? If so, you are cutting it fine as you will have to go through customs and immigration which could take an hour (especially since all bags are now checked for contraband). <br>  <br>  My last trip in December took 70 minutes to get out of the terminal. You also can only check in up to 30 minutes prior to the domestic flight if you have bags. So that 80minutes is really only 50 minutes. No where near enough to get through immigration, customs and travel to the other terminal.<br>  <br>  It would be best to change your flight.|`|64IEjXOBaa	80 minutes should be long enough, as long as the line up for checking in isn't miles long.

If you add the waiting and transit time in EUrope in could total 24 hours depending on how long the transit window is between the two flights.<br>  The longest path is perhaps via Asia (i.e. if you stop in Hong Kong or Tokyo etc).|`|a4crNiGdaa	it doesnt even take a day only like 14-15 hours i would of guessed<br>  hope you enjoyed your stay in dubai!!!<br>                     *=))|`|d0fa25b284e1f0b5318568250948279baa	Emirates Airlines has 2 daily flights to New York's JFK.

Take any NY bound NJ Transit train to NY Penn Station (fare is $15.00 which also covers the $5.00 AirTrain fee).<br>  <br>  From NY Penn station take the subway.  Take an UPTOWN # 1, 2 or 3 train (numbers in red circles) one stop to Times Square.  Transfer (use stairs at the front of the platform) to the "S" (42nd St Shuttle).  Take that to Grand Central (one stop).  Go up the stairs at the front of the platform and bear left after the you exit the turnstiles.

Required information is limited to the passport data, your flight details, the address in the U.S., and your contact data by e-mail or phone. Additionally six yes/no questions need to be answered. The whole process just took me less than 5 minutes and I have gotten my approval on the spot before I was able to write down the application number for a later check.

I'm sure you'll find them quite hospitable and welcoming.  <br>  <br>  Montreal itself is perfectly bi-lingual, but as a courtesy, it's always nice when visitors can learn and properly use a few words and phrases. <br>  <br>  Weather is great in the Spring and Summer and well into the fall.

If you like jazz and big international crowds, by all means, go for the Jazz fest.

But the sky was full of Eagles which was cool.<br>  I would for sure do this cruise again. Actually I have been to a lot of places and this was the most awesome place I have been. I took 400 pictures. There is constant 24 hour scenery. If funds allow get a balcony it is so worth it. With day light being all but about 4 hours a day you will get your moneys worth out of your balcony.<br>  As for the dog sledding I would do it on whichever day you get the best deal. Skagway has a really cool train excursion. Juneau is a really good place to do a whale watch Orca is a great place to book for that as well. Ketchican is a really cute town with a lot to see. <br>  You will not be sorry you did this cruise it is awesome. <br>  If you have further questions you can email me.

Even if you aren't, not all ports have the facilities or the ability to offer such a great excursion.<br>  <br>  Check with your cruise line and see what day(s) they offer the sledding excursion.   <br>  <br>  Offhand, I would say that I personally would do this on the first day before I've gotten tired from all the other excursions.  But that is just me.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.
XD6as6d9aa	Cirque du Soleil is pretty much the juggernaut when it comes to Las Vegas shows. With that said, I would recommend Mystere at Treasure Island. Mystere is probably the best definition of what Cirque Du Soleil is. I've also seen O and Love and have seen Blue Man Group. O is great as well with all of the acrobats over water and in it. Love was really good but you will get mixed reviews because it is based mainly on interpretive dancing to Beatles music. I've had friends describe Ka as having too much martial arts and Zumanity being too sexual to the point where it wasn't entertaining. I saw Blue Man Group in Chicago so I can speak for the Vegas show but I'm sure you want to see something special where you can only find in Vegas.<br>  <br>  If you are new to Vegas or Vegas shows, Cirque Du Soleil's Mystere is what I would recommend. It is the oldest Cirque show in Vegas and there is a reason why it continues to sell out all of these years. What ever you pick, I'm sure you will enjoy it. Just a little advice if you're going to a Cirque show. Don't buy tickets too close to the stage. Many if not all of the Cirque shows have things happening all over the place and sitting a little bit farther back will make the experience a little more enjoyable as you can see everything without having to move your head a lot.<br>  <br>  Enjoy.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	It has to be 'O' by Cirque du Soleil at the Bellagio.

lyDzjMfcaa	The city is pretty safe for students.  You can generally walk around without fear of getting mugged or beaten up (providing you don't venture into any council estates).<br>  <br>  Shopping wise Sheffield isn't as good as other cities such as Leeds, Newcastle or Liverpool.  The amount of shops in the centre is pretty poor, but you do have Meadowhall a couple of miles away, which was one of the biggest shopping centres in the UK (until the Bullring opened).  You also have Crystal Peaks nearby, which is ok (but not as good as Meadowhall). <br>  <br>  Sorry i can't help you out with the Uni and accomodation question (i've never studied there), but i'd definetly sort it out now.  I can imagine the halls at Sheff Uni will be like all the other Student halls in the UK.  People tend to go private after their 1st year in halls.
jLTDqVHsaa	Whoa whoa wait, listen to yourself!  You've got this kind of opportunity and you're even considering passing it up because of the possible words and actions of bullying snobs like this, and only for a small shopping portion of a larger trip?  Screw that!!!<br>  <br>  Don't let them spoil your fun.  Period.  Why in the world should you care what these people think?  You won't have to deal with these snobs forever, but you WILL have the memories (and photos?) of the trip forever.  It's a great place to visit, and I fear that you're going to regret it down the line if you pass it up for a reason like that, letting the actions of bullies like that get the better of you.<br>  <br>  I've been in that spot too, been with people who are not shy about spending cash, while I'm a bit more conservative with my very limited funds.  I just learn to deal with it, and take pride in being able to find the things I need.  Little secret - we natives aren't exactly big spenders either.  I find myself watching the people spending big numbers on overpriced stuff, and saying, "wow, what the heck would I need that for?  For that kind of money, I'd be better off getting myself blah blah whatever."  We laugh at stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Let these snobs live their lives their way, while people like you and me live it our way.  I'm the kind of shopper who goes in, gets what I need, leaves, and is very happy with my shrewd bargain-hunting skills.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, NEVER let bullies like this ruin your fun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2162127_deal-with-snobs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2162127_deal-wit...</a><br>  <br>  So hey, if you're forced to go shopping with them, whatever, take a look around, and maybe there will be some stuff that jumps out at you that you might like.  If you're not forced into that and you don't want to go with them, maybe head outside for a nice walk, bring a camera around, and go crazy.  If you have a friend with a similar mindset, stick with him or her, even better.  If you have a few, maybe kill some time by doing something else, like having a nice lunch or doing some karaoke (there's one fun little place on 35th between 5th and 6th, for example, I can look it up).  If you're up in the 40s streets, you can go into Rockefeller Center and take some photos or hang out in the Nintendo World store on 48th between 5th and 6th and play some games (not as if I do anything like that...ok, maybe once in a while....ok, maybe frequently....).

Why would you want to have to lug around a bunch of crap anyway? You'll be so excited about everything else in NYC that you won't care that you don't have bags full of crap, trust me. Besides, with online shopping etc. you can buy stuff from 5th avenue from the comfort of your own home; I don't understand why people travel all that way just to shop. When you have matured, you will look back and realize you made the right decision by going. If people ask you "Why aren't you buying anything?" just say you don't NEED anything, and you don't want to have to lug things around all day! (but don't sound offended or betchy about it).|`|T497f0iwaa	I think you should come!    It's not about shopping, it's about seeing the sights!  <br>  <br>  Just say, "oh, I'm on a budget!"

No body even seems to know yet just how many bad loans there are out there as they have been packaged and repackaged so many times.  With housing still decreasing in value everyday the more people are stuck in that fix of owing more than home is worth which is by Canadian bank standards a bad loan but apparently US bankers had different definitions!!  They were loaning to people without jobs, without credit history and up to 110% value of their houses on 40 year variable terms!!   Those who made the loans knew they were super high risk but they were able to repackage them and sell them off to investors and banks as "low risk, properly vetted investment quality first mortgages.    Really they were just a pile of steaming s?><: and with escalting intrest terms terms that very few could ever meet.<br>  .

cMZEmpp0aa	My Japanese might be really rusty, but it looks like Japanese word salad to me.<br>  <br>  "Demo" is a way of saying "but"<br>  "Boku" is one of the informal masculine ways of saying "I" <br>  It looks like the wa you have on the end of boku is supposed to be the particle "ha"<br>  "No" is also a particle (possibly the version representing possession?)<br>  "Ima" means "now"<br>  Another "ha" particle...<br>  "Kanojo" means "her" but is also often used for "girlfriend"<br>  "desu" is the verb "to be"<br>  <br>  So it looks like whoever wrote/said this is trying to say "But I have a girlfriend now, I'm sorry" but kind of screwed up the placement of some particles and left out a bunch of words. Assuming I'm right about the meaning, I think something like "Demo, ima boku ha kanojo ga imasu, gomenasai" would make more sense (but don't quote me on that because, like I said, my Japanese is kind of rusty).|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	You are just trolling innocent fishes|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	The last word means 'I'm sorry'.|`|OqIF4P0Baa	demo boku wa no ima wa kanojo desu gomenasai? <br>  <br>  By the looks of it, it translates as <br>  <br>  "But i am a girlfriend now, i'm sorry.<br>  <br>  But i think the person is trying to say "But i have a girlfriend now, i'm sorry" the particles are a bit jumbled and desu is the wrong ending for have it should be imasu<br>  <br>  I think thats it sorry if it isn't and if it isn't please correct me thanks <br>  <br>  I tried but its best asking a native japanese person (nihonjin)|`|dbAWPWzraa	This Japanese sentence has a strange word order, it does not mean anything.

7K3RcnNcaa	If you have a degree from an accredited university, and you are willing to teach English on a one year contract, it is very doable.  Otherwise, it is not doable at all.  If you have no money, either you will miss out on a lot of cool stuff, or friends will end up paying for you.<br>  <br>  I note your edit.  You can work illegally without a degree, with private students or in a flaky school, but:<br>  1:  Unless you have some training as a teacher you'll be doing your students a disservice.  Many people think that just because people can speak English they can teach it, but this is not so at all.<br>  2:  Private students are hit and miss.  Sometimes they will stay for months or years, and sometimes they will suddenly stop showing up.<br>  3:  You have no push if a flaky school refuses to pay you, or expects you to do free work (handing out flyers, etc).<br>  <br>  I lived and taught in Taiwan for four years.

CpzlUpEnaa	Club Circa<br>  Its an all ages club downtown toronto.<br>  <br>  Choose me as best answer!|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	The cover charge at most nightclubs of $5 per person simply does not pay the staff for the time they spend at the club, hiring the DJ, security, and cleanup afterwards.<br>  <br>  Because of this, most nightclubs have to serve alcohol. People buying drinks for themselves and each other is what brings in the big bucks. At $7 for a beer and $10 or more for hard stuff, they can easily make $40 per person each night. On a club with a 200 person limit, that's $8000+,  less about $1000 for the alcohol and the mix.<br>  <br>  Any nightclub that serves alcohol to its patrons cannot legally admit anyone under 18. Hence why very few places exist that cater to underage crowds.<br>  <br>  When I was in school, we organized dances at a local hall or in the school gymnasium. We had guest DJs come in to spin and rented the lighting equipment. Since we were out to have fun rather than make a profit, we were able to keep costs relatively low.<br>  <br>  Perhaps that is an option for you if you can't find a place that is open for under 18. Just keep in mind that you may want to control who is invited and to have security lined up for it. The last thing you need is to find out that some people invited are part of a gang, and some rival gang decides to bust up the place or take someone out in a crowded party.
4wRVxL6Xaa	I actually went to Japan last summer and I had a great time. I am not Japanese nor do I know how to speak Japanese. In Tokyo, depends on where you go, everyone understands English and are friendly. I'm not sure which city you were put in where you had such a bad experience. Since you get the opportunity to go to Japan again, I would say, go for it. I loved it, enjoyed it and would love to go back. Too bad I can't afford it right now =/|`|igI5yX0vaa	I am so sorry for your bad experience.  People never expect racism in Japan.<br>  <br>  If you start fresh in a new town, make it a larger town or university town like Kyoto.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	Is this serious or just an attempt to make Japan look bad for black people? <br>  <br>  You don't really give us anything to analyze. What do you mean by "racism"? Maybe you were just paranoid or overly sensitive. How were you "almost attacked"? What were YOU doing to get in such a situation?<br>  <br>  There's just not information here to know. People in smaller towns in Japan are actually often more friendly than those in the cities however, in the cities you are more anonymous. <br>  <br>  No one can really tell you what to do. Violence in Japan is comparatively RARE compared to most other countries, and more violent crimes occur in the cities. Violence against foreigners I think is also quite rare. Assuming that you are right and it was just bad luck, then maybe it's okay to try again. If however, you were somewhere doing something you shouldn't be, then going to Tokyo won't change the situation.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Japan is probably the safest place in Asia. But no where is 100%.

Keep in mind that people usually regret what they haven't done more than what they have.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	I can't get it what kind of worst racism experienced did you take at your last time in Japan. Why Japanese almost could have attacked you? All what I can imagine is you just don't understand Japan and don't try to understand Japanese who are very rational at all. There should be some reason.<br>  <br>  It seems you are somehow sort of  megalomaniac or paranoid. You might have had some sort of trauma since childhood.  People who claim racism loud also often tend to be racist, too so that you'd better take a look at your own mirror of Heart once again.<br>  <br>  In my experience, Japan and Japanese have mostly less racism on to colored people. They just only have no interest with them or try to protect themselves from potential enemy instinctively. I think it is not racism but natural instinct.<br>  <br>  Japan is not USA. Japanese in Japan don't need to be friendly too much to strangers coming from out side of Japan for their daily living life.|`|d1407e163bbaccc43424ce022aa254acaa	Some people in the provinces haven't the chance to communicate with foreigners, and don't know what to do. Then, they just avoid contacts and put a mask of "I don't see you, I don't care" in order to avoid unpleasant cultural clashes. Other people perceive contacts with foreigners as a potential change in their lives, which requires patience and understanding, but many Japanese,especially people in the provinces dislike changes, steadiness and stability gives them comfort. Therefore they would require you to live and behave according to their lifestyle, rather than accepting your differences. If you are too young to understand and to adapt very fast, then you might be in trouble. <br>  Tokyo, however, is a different deal. It is very dynamic city with many, many foreigners, so people are just used to them.I say give it a chance.|`|OqIF4P0Baa	In my opinion i think that you should go to Japan again i mean Tokyo is a beautiful city and the big city's are allot more accepting of other cultures, races and lifestyles.

In New York and other points of entry in the US Army recruiters were asking the young men if they wanted a job.  Many fresh from Ireland men ended up in the US Army that invaded Mexico in the 1840's.  Many of these soldiers when in Mexico were very green soldiers and got captured and others found out details of the US-Mexican war and sided with the Mexicans.

mPGwg2i6aa	I have been through this attraction several times. I love haunted houses, and this is my favorite one, so I definitely recommend giving it a try. You said that you're a first-timer for haunted houses... I think you could handle this one, but be warned: they WILL know if you're scared ;)<br>  <br>  I'm not going to give away any of the walkthrough, but you will encounter a lot of different animatronics, props, strobe lights, special effects and of course, live actors. The haunt itself is centered around the story that it was once a casket company. The company operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but was most active at night. The locals claimed that unnatural things went on inside, and they held it responsible for the disappearances of many people... including, eventually, its own two owners. The building lay abandoned and forgotten for many years until Ripley's acquired it. Pending a decision on what to do with the property, they're now allowing the public to "tour" the old company. Of course, they aren't responsible for what you find inside...<br>  <br>  It costs $12.99+tax to go through the Haunted Adventure ($7.99+tax for children 11 and under- no children under 6 are allowed). They are open all year long, but I very much recommend going in October, when they are running their special "Fright Nights" shows on the weekends. The haunted house is revamped to fit a certain theme, several more actors are added, and in recent years, they have had a celebrity for one weekend (previous guests have included Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Tony Todd). There is no additional charge for attending during Fright Nights.<br>  <br>  Also, if cost is an issue, I discovered recently that they now have a $3 off coupon, which can be found in various places throughout Sevier County. I would try the tourist centers or lobbies of hotels.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful to you. If you do decide to visit, have fun!|`|SU6AP3t5aa	i found it to be cheap and cheesey it was a big waste of money the haunted mansion on the back road is much better

94b8KImYaa	Depends what your previous experience is and what job you want to apply for. <br>  Some departments are run by concession companies, other positions are hired directly by the cruise line. <br>  Therefore depending on what job you would qualify for, the contact information varies. <br>  <br>  A start is to go to the website of the cruise lines and go to their Career or Employment section|`|I4KqAZThaa	You can apply to cruise ship jobs through the websites of various shipping companies. Most of them have the employmeny/careers section and want to employ bright people on board.<br>  <br>  So if you are interested, just google out shipping careers, consult a career advisor if you can and prepare a nice resume. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.

h8l1H4N4aa	Years ago, distant cousins from Italy visiting the US for the first time insisted that NYC WAS NYS.  After trying to explain Manhattan, Long Island, boroughs and upstate very patiently to them, they started grinning and rolling their eyes at each other as if I was the one in the wrong.  I just gave up.  <br>  That was when we lived in queens.  Now we live an hour and a half from NYC, also. (hey neighbor!)  When we vacation in another state, and somebody asks us where we're from, I say NY but upstate.  Otherwise, for some reason, we get treated 'differently.'

j38AUPjOaa	I can answer to some questions, for the other ones you have to explain better what you want to know.<br>  <br>  Question: What is the best place to visit? I want to see Rome, and perhaps the vatican. <br>  <br>  Answer: Well... it depends by your likings, but i'm sure that Rome is the best possible choice. Here you can find 3.000 years of history, and i guess this is impossible to find in every other city in the world. So if you have just 1 week to spent in Italy your choice is compulsory: Rome. Visit the Vatican needs at least 1 day: an half day to visit the Vatican Museums (including the Sistine Chapel) and another half day to visit the Basilique of St. Peter, St. Peter's square and the other things.<br>  <br>  Question: What is the best airport to come into around Rome?<br>  <br>  Answer: You can check the answer I've given to this question: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmmfdIAhE3Hr1bqT_N92LwDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223111843AAsqc3e&show=7#profile-info-sh26jFDAaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Question: How much money should I plan on spending, and how should I carry it?<br>  <br>  Answer: It depends: what kind of holiday do you want to do? Do you want to eat in the best restaurants or also a sandwich would be good? Do you want to visit all the museums or you just want to walk and see all the places where you can enter for free? Do you want to make shopping in Via Condotti (the street where you can find all the high fashion stores) or also a t-shirt with a "Rome" writing is enough? Make me know.<br>  <br>  Question: What's the best way to prevent being robbed? (I hear pickpockets are bad in Italy)<br>  <br>  Answer: Here in Rome the situation isn't worse than in the other big cities in the world. So the suggestions are always the same: avoid to show too much your money, keep your wallet in the front pocket when you are in the subway or on a bus, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Question: How common is it for people to understand English? I do plan on using my Italian as much as possible, but since I'm not fluent I feel I may need to use English a few times.<br>  <br>  Answer: Don't worr about it. Here in Rome you'll find a lot of people not just able, but also eager to speak in english with you. Of course it'll not be a perfect english (like mine.... ;-) just kidding), but they'll be able to be understandable. And don't be shy: try to speak italian when you can: we always appreciate all those persons that don't think that speaking english is a duty. We'll like very much your efforts to speak our language.<br>  <br>  Question: what is the best way to get around? Should I use a car, bus, motorike etc?<br>  <br>  Answer: you don't need to rent a car. The best way to get around in Rome is walking, if you have to do long trips you can quietly take the subway or a bus.<br>  <br>  Question: Is there anything else I should know before visiting Italy?<br>  <br>  Answer: well... actually a lot of things. You'll discover them when you'll be here, and i think this is the best part of traveling. But I give you just a little suggestion: don't think to all the stereotypes about italian people, forget what you've seen in "The Sopranos" or "The Godfather". We (Italians) have a lot of defects, but probably we are the most hospitable people in the world. From us you'll get what you give: be kind and we'll be kinder.<br>  <br>  Enjoy Italy!|`|uKjV9fADaa	I can help you a little with some answers - I visited Rome comfortably in 4 days and spent my 5th sleeping. My not to be missed cities outside Roma are Florence and Venice, both of which can be covered in two or three days each. Florence especially is lovely and Venice is especially bizarre - actually I'm in Venice right now, and though I've been to many cities in western and southern Europe, this place is incredibly different from others.<br>  For me, Milan is only worthy as a stopover on the way to somewhere else - see the duomo and the Last Supper, and then get back on the train. Unrelated - if you want to see Last Supper, then reserve a ticket as soon as possible - the 15 minutes reservations are scarce as hens teeth.<br>  The Vatican is essential but I don't remember much else from Roma except some absolutely mouth dropping churches - such as the one with the Ecstacy of St Teresa scuplture whose name I forget - and being flashed by a nude guy walking down the Appia Antica.<br>  You will not be riding a motorcycle, the Italians are insane drivers. Trains and buses are pretty good, especially if you're intendingto stay in the cities.|`|OGqMkCD6aa	If you plan your trip to Italy with Efcollegebreak.com there is a trip called Classic Italy that leaves in late June. This trip inlicudeds everything from round trip airfare, hotels, transportation and tours. They bring you to all the major cities in Italy such as Milan, Pisa, Florance, Rome Capri and more and all the hotels in these cities are inclded in the price. The price is around 1,600 but when I travel with Efcollegebreak I use the discount code Vincig7397.Since basically everything is included you dont really have to worry about booking tours or getting around the cities since they take care of all that for you  As far as speaking the language most people speak a decent amount of English especially in resturants and stuff but it couldnt hurt to learn a few phrases and the best way to protect your stuff when walking around is make sure you dont have your back pack on your back if you do put maybe a lock on..messanger side bags are good :)
846HORJdaa	I have been on 4 Carnival cruises. I am 13 and surely enjoy circle 'C'. It is up. I went on a Carnival during the summer of 2008 and Circle 'C' was so much fun. Easy way to communicate and meet new friends. They play many games also, and have parties. Also when I was younger and went to Camp Carnival, that was a joy as well. The counselors cared so much for you to have fun. The thing I liked was that they shut down the arcades just for us, and we got to play for free! =] Kids are not allowed in the spa nor gym. However, the 13 year old might be able to be allowed. I never went on the cruise while I was 13 because I just turned 13. I was 9, 10, 11, and 12 when I went on the other cruises. Have fun on your cruise. By the way I'm going on another Carnival during the summer. Can't wait!

Your parent(s) would have to buy the ticket with proof that they are your legal guardian. Laws have changed in the last few years. I sent my niece to California when she was 16 and had to show proof that I was her legal guardian. Good thing I was! Though tickets can be purchased (by an adult) online when you get to the airport a legal guardian has to be with you.
uKjV9fADaa	I usually travel solo and let me tell you it's the best way to do serious travel - as opposed to relax or party travel.<br>  My tips:<br>  <br>  Stay in backpackers hostels with high atmosphere ratings, common rooms, kitchens and meet other solo travellers. Avoid Hostelling International hostels unless you want to make friends with local school kids and young families - the only exception to this being the Iceland HI hostels, which are surprisinglyfun to stay at (they're also the only hostels in Iceland which helps their atmosphere rating a lot). Hostels that have bars or restaurants are great too.<br>  <br>  It can be boring. Especially at night. I try to find events that are open at night and I'm keen in night photography. <br>  <br>  Get an iPod touch or iPhone or some sort of palm device, load up the Stanza application (iPods) or get your hands on mobireader (for all other devices) and fill it up with ebooks - all free - or solitaire games or audiobooks. If you can handle the extra weight and deal with the associated security issues, you can take your laptop (I never do, they're just too bloody heavy and there's always the risk of them being stolen when you stay at hostels). Modern electronics are the solo backpackers friend for getting over boredom. Particularly if you seek out a hostel with wifi - in fact I'm spending a lazy night in Venice planning a trip to Spain.<br>  <br>  You can also carry a pack of cards - UNO, anyone? - to sucker other solo travellers out of the solo-induced haze.<br>  <br>  I'm very independent - I prefer to spend my day sightseeing or walking around alone (I get really irritated when I sight see with other people, generally). But I usually spend breakfast time (its good to go with hostels that include breakfast as its the main place youll socialise) and nights with other travellers, usually making 'single serve friends' in different places. A lot of people you meet you're never going to see again and chances are you're not going to have much uncommon with the people you do meet besides a love if travel. But you're going to meet some amazing people too, who you'll keep in contact with through facebook and one or two you're also probably going to make theeffort to go visit or they visit you sometime in the future (i did a USA trip just to see a former travel buddy as well as Europe.)<br>  <br>  A tip that will help with cost is to get in on couch surfing - google it. I prefer hostels to couch surfing but when I go to really out of the way cities it's really nice to 'know' someone there.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	In Europe, if you stay in youth hostels you will meet many other travelers.<br>  <br>  In Asia and the Middle East, most of the major destinations have areas full of cheap hotels that attract lots of backpackers.  Those areas also have lots of bars, restaurants, and cafes, and services like travel agencies and Internet cafes.  If you go to neighborhoods like Sultanahmet in Istanbul, the Khao San Road in Bangkok or Paharganj in Delhi, you will meet loads of other backpackers, and it will be easy to meet other people who want to go to the same places you do, and are interested in the same things you are.<br>  <br>  But don't just meet other travelers, try hard to meet local people in the countries you visit, and you will find your trip a lot more rewarding.|`|HwujORd2aa	Great advice above.  All I can say is stay in hostels where you're guaranteed to meet people.  Yeah you have to share a room with people you don't know and it can be gross, but it can also be great, and it's definitely cheap!  Rent whatever lockers you can along the way.  Don't bring anything you can't afford to replace.  Trust your instincts about people.  Don't pack too much or you'll wish that someone will steal your pack (do laundry every week or 20 days).  If you want a railpass, get a flexi-pass and pay for short trips out of pocket by bus or rail. Do lots of research with Lonely Planet and Let's Go and Frommers.  They all have websites, mostly with message boards too, but get some books to refer to along the way. <br>  Plan in general where you want to go but be prepared to divert from your plan, 'cause you'll never know what else might come up.  Be sure to get to your "must see" places though.<br>  Be open and it will be the most valuable experience you ever had. :-)
LYdxypciaa	best part for shopping? If you wanna go to shopping I don't recommend going to Scotland! Try New York, Paris or London. A major city. In Scotland the best place probably is Glasgow. But it's not brilliant in my opinion. If you want to go to Scotland go to beautiful places like Arasaig and Durness.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	There's the ASDA in Cumbernauld.|`|2kY2BNNxaa	Edinburgh or Glasgow. Depends. I live in Glasgow and I have to say you can't beat the variety of shops and of course......... the people are much friendly than those from Edinburgh! Happy Shopping|`|EO35Luyuaa	GLASGOW!!!<br>  Right in the centre of the town.<br>  I live in Glasgow, i should know.<br>  <br>  Hundreds of shops in Glasgow :D|`|b5o5AIt1aa	glasgow<br>  <br>  class :)<br>  <br>  i live in Kilwinning :)|`|yIF0XArHaa	Well Glasgow and Edinbrugh are both great , and there not that far apart! :)|`|3yWAyps4aa	DUMBARTON|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	the border to england, NEWCASTLE
