I couldn't answer questions all day earlier this week.  Sometimes going back to the question and refreshing the page produces your answers, but if it's anything like the other day... probably won't work this time.  All i can suggest is do some other things here.  If you have any open questions that you can choose a Best Answer for, you can do that.  You can click on the "Vote undecided questions" tab in any desired category and vote for Best Answer on questions that have gone to voting.  You could read the exciting Community Guidelines and have a better understand of the rules.  Other than those suggestions, you are probably out of luck for a while for answering questions.  Just try every now and then.|`|1l7bK325aa	wait a couple of minutes before going on again<br>  or you could sign out and then sign in again<br>  or you could go to the forum help|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I know, it has been running hot and cold for me|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It was doing this all day yesterday for me, not today. it's your turn haha
suPD7c3gaa	No... it doesn't matter how the Best Answer are achieved. So they can be chosen by the asker, or by votes if the question goes to voting. Just to clarify, it's not just 50 answers in a month.  It's 40-50 answers in ONE category in about a month.  The percentage is simply based on the percentage of Best Answers chosen from those answers in the one category.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I personally think you get cheated because I have been in a certain section for a good while and even got some best answer and I have never gotten top contributor.

7u77AiBjaa	In your Yahoo! 360, yes. In Yahoo! Answers, no. You have your Yahoo! Avatar option selected.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if your image shows up when you go to click the "360 image" option in your Y/A profile settings or not. Choose that option and wait. Although, you should choose one of your images in 360 as the primary image as well.<br>  <br>  The image will eventually show up. It can take anywhere from minutes to weeks. If you don't want to wait, continue using the Yahoo! Avatar and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now). <br>  <br>  Otherwise, after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. Although, you are not guaranteed a written response from staff. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.

Profile (to which Yahoo! 360 will eventually finish migrating).<br>  <br>  When you start a Yahoo account, you automatically get a Yahoo Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) associated with that primary Yahoo ID. It used to be called the Yahoo! Members Profile, but it has been recently updated. This new profiling system has been integrated with your Yahoo! Mail Welcome tab to create a "smarter inbox". If you don't want to participate, turn off the entire panel by:<br>  <br>  - Clicking "Options" in the upper right corner of your Mail screen.<br>  - Click "Mail Options."<br>  - In the General section, uncheck "Enable Connection-related features (Messages, Suggestions, Updates)."<br>  - Click the "Save Changes" button on the top left.|`|4fa79abc921b5615b3a81280bdca2d2baa	i had that too, i had to keep clicking ignore everytime i went to my mail page until eventually it didnt have any more suggestions lol

On the email click the link to get to the briefcase, you will see folders listed, but they should be empty since you didn't know about it. If by chance you do have things in the folders, you will need to move it out back to your computer or Yahoo will delete them. You probably don't have anything to worry about.

AA12270507	Send an email to them asking for an explanation on "purchased item in error? Did the seller not mean to sell it" ??<br>  Since your echeck already went through, this might be a scam. Contact ebay (email) and explani the situation and simply ask for advice.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of this. If you won the item and then paid for it, your echeck has been processed, then the seller is required by ebay rules to ship you the item. If not, then the seller needs to give you your money back "in full"<br>  <br>  Have you already received the item or got an email saying it's be shipped?

If you become a member of their program and are unable to complete one of their offers,  you still qualify for a gift if you get 3 of your friends to complete an offer. What that actually means is that they are harvesting mail addresses and that will definetely get you and your friends loads of SPAM in your mail accounts!<br>  <br>  Specifics about their TOS: <<Freebiejeebies reserve the right to check all referrals for signs of fraud.>> Sounds okay, but then they go on saying that they <<... reserve the right, to determine which referrals are fraudulent, and to not disclose the reasoning behind this decision if in doing so we would compromise our detection methods>>. That of course means that they can do what they want and you'll maybe end up with nothing for all your work.<br>  <br>  Also in their TOS I found this: <<Freebiejeebies cannot guarantee the receipt of any product regardless of offers completed or referrals gained.>> Nice, eh? That of course means that if you're elegible for a gift and it never arrives at your doorstep, you're left on your own and can't even complain to them!<br>  <br>  To sum it all up: stay away from such a site!

When Obama said the checks were in the mail in the speech last night, he was talking about the 8$ that the average worker's taxes will be reduced per week.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There are no stimulus checks this year. There is a tax credit on your tax return if you did not receive a stimulus check or the entire amount last year. You compute what the rebate would be using a form in the instructions based on last year's income. You then subtract what you received last year. The balance is a credit on the tax.<br>  <br>  There has been a change in the tax tables that will cause lower earning workers to pay less tax and higher earning workers to pay more tax that will be implemented by April 1.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|AA11004428	why is this in the yahoo! section?

y6CGTNT5aa	In my school firefighters cant leave during school to go to a call without getting in trouble (hate that rule). I heard some schools may allow it.  I might leave if I knew it wasn't a BS call and it was confirmed structure fire. It would be ok if the call went out right before school and he got to school late. BTW hope he keeps his pager on vibrate during class... actually tell the school to go **** themselves, the call could be educational to some.|`|AA10132204	I think if he checked with the department, they would tell not to leave school for a call.  Even working people can't just leave at any time to respond.  The rule is usually if circumstances allow.  So your son was in the wrong and could get in real trouble with the school.|`|AA11004428	why is this in the yahoo! section?|`|hXk1JGj2aa	Some schools may allow a student to leave to go to emergency calls, sometimes they require a parent or fire chief to authorize it. One thing that is a fact is that when a student is in school while school is in session the student is basically their responsibility or their property, therefore they have the final decision as to whether he can leave or not....obviously everyone has free will and can leave whenever but it might bring on punitive action by the school. Another thing is that he is 18 years old and there for can sign himself out of school If there is a call that goes in before school is in session and he requests a late to work/school form from the chief or company officer and it is signed by them he can then go to school/work hand it in and be considered late with a excuse of absence and no punitive action should be taken....if it is I would question whoever seeks punishment against him. There are actually laws that deal with this but I won't take a guess as to what they state specifically as I don't know what state you live in. From personal experience I used to leave all the time for fires, usually only if they were serious though and I was always getting into trouble for it, then again I hated school and could care less what they had to say or how they decided to punish me.... I hope your son realizes that school is more important than fires as there will always be fires.|`|76K7hw5baa	There is a law for working people that says someone can leave for a call and not be punished or fired by law. Im not sure if it applys to school. at 18 he is free to leave. im 17 and I can leave if dispatch calls a deskbox. (He should know what that is if you dont.) Otherwise it is at the teacher of the class that im in weather or not I can go. I would suggest talking to the chief or assistant chief and possibly set up a meeting with the principal. Thats how I did it.|`|yTxVfUDcaa	saving a life is more important than learning about the past when a stupid president died..haha
3IimJWgXaa	Nameste! <br>  i just moved back from New Delhi maybe three weeks ago((: i miss it so much): I was there for treatment for my disease.<br>  <br>  Im so sorry about yourself and your girlfriend, i hated living in India and my bf in U.S. its hard. But theres this GREAT! FREE program called Skype. Go to Skype.com and download the program, you can web cam, chat, send videos, songs, pictures, you can put money on the account if you want so that if your online, you can call her cell phone from your computer. <br>  <br>  Or start writing letters to one another, its always exciting to know that you have a letter coming in the mail for you. (:<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  p.s<br>  the phone service in india sucks): sms is so hard.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	hand written letters|`|N0EEYQUnaa	I can only think of Skype or MSN like webcam chats and phone chats you can do on that.<br>  Other than those two things you really just have to go visit her.|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	Plan a vacation. Seriously as soon as you can try to get to her. And if that's out of the question keep trying your internet chat lines.
A7QROnjLaa	For sure, the world sucks like that huh. It's easier to get something when you already have it, what a cruel world!|`|SaINc1Plaa	yes, you're more desirable to someone because you have a gf/bf<br>  <br>  someone else is obviously into you enough to date you so other think you're more dateable|`|uhZ38xYkaa	True that one!|`|9nfkTVm6aa	Yes I agree with that. Your prospective employer wants to see someone that is reliable and dependable. Well grounded. You present yourself as someone who has something to give. Most people want to improve their life and move up. That is why they are looking to change jobs. A go getter and that is makes you look like you are willing to give to your new job 100%. Just my opinion.|`|uGxWOIOdaa	i cant agree with the others.<br>  i have gotten plenty of jobs without already having one.<br>  it has been said that someone is more attractive when they already have a partner but that can always go the other way too.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Yes because girls are not that smart, so they only like you once you are unavailable.
MCSB8ezRaa	Twill is a kind of weave.  It looks like the threads go up diagonally, rather than a plain weave, where the threads go vertically and crosswise.  <br>  <br>  Many name brand jeans are made from twill-weave denim.  You can check the jeans you have and see the difference.<br>  <br>  So really, the difference is in how the fabric looks, not in how it will wear.  You will want to see if the manufacturer or retailer tells you the weight of the fabric.  14-oz fabric is heavy, jeans weight. 6 or 8 oz is light weight, shirt weight.  14-oz. fabric refers to how much a square yard of the fabric weighs.

AXLjSj2qaa	To be honest I have wondered the same thing and I happen to be a foreigner (except I speak good english). But to be honest, i think its a culture thing. If you have ever been to South American countries, they actually act like that there too. I personally think its stupid because I don't think doing that to girls has ever worked. <br>  <br>  But if you apply this same concept to the rich and poor people (same race), it's like that too. There are things that the lower class do that make the upper class roll their eyes at disgust. Its all about culture.|`|Hzw8wHusaa	Because they are probably foreign and don't see Americans typically ?|`|8yE2sYGeaa	They want you to know that they are fluent in the language of love and are willing to show you how versed they are|`|7rD3uJzdaa	Because if they told you they thought you were cute you would not understand them unless you spoke their language?

Ly9L53AYaa	you cant. sorry
GChWTGNiaa	Yeah, I feel that way.<br>  Someone who really, really doesn't like me has a friend up high who keeps deleting my questions, I'm thinking.<br>  I asked a question about banjos and mandolins because I was thinking of getting a new instrument, and Y!A deleted it for being inappropriate.<br>  It's a conspiracy!|`|W0hNoMSsaa	I don't know if it's a conspiracy, but I think there are people on here who are angry and vindictive. <br>  <br>  Earlier today I answered a question in the Gender and Women's Studies section by someone who was clearly on a rampage against feminists. His question went something like this: "How bright would the world be if all the feminists in the world who hate men were light bulbs?" <br>  <br>  I thought it was a ridiculous, biased question from a troll who was trying to bring out other woman haters who would agree with him.<br>  <br>  My answer was based on a famous quote by the 19th century British author Oscar Wilde: "I refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed man."  I thought my answer was rather funny and certainly not out of line.<br>  <br>  The next thing I knew, I had a Terms of Service violation notice in my mailbox. For what little consolation it was, the original question was deleted, so maybe the troll got one, too. One can only hope. I protested the violation notice, but Yahoo let it stand. <br>  <br>  The point is that even if you think you are being reasonable and telling the truth, if someone doesn't like it they can report you.  So yes, it is "kinda like a conspiracy."|`|5O62YuUJaa	i think people should be able to answer a question anyway they want,unless there spamming. sometimes its fun to give a funny answer and be a little controversial.other times you can tell that the person really has there heart into the question, thats when your answer should come from the heart as well. what happened to our freedom of speech? oh , thats right it doesn't apply to yahoo answers.hang in there mystacal,its not our faults that were sleeping with the wrong people.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Yeah.... the feminist section is like a firing squad for my answers.|`|AA10520442	How do you know who is reporting you?  There is no way to know unless the person tells you.   <br>  <br>  No, I do not feel that there is a conspiracy at work here. I feel that alot of people read what is here and maybe they don't say much.  When they see something that violates the guidelines they report it.  Ranting at someone about their socio econmoic status is definitely a violation.|`|xlxZV0Xsaa	everyone in this world wants to be the best and not be criticized. but some people have to learn that the truth, which is the best sometimes, is what makes someone uniqe. people just got to deal with it.

If you are an automated spammer, you cannot read and copy the character string, if you are human, you can.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	It's  an anti spam measure that Yahoo are trying out to make sure it is a person sending the mail not a bot.. I am very curious as to why they are going to these lengths though. It would suggest that they are aware of some serious bot spammers infiltrating Yahoo Answers. We will have to wait and see how long it continues.

9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.|`|IM7vMURJaa	Try the old version of Yahoo! mail and then if it works then use that.<br>  Its probably some kind of runtime error with one of your addons.<br>  Thats basically it though

GIqHMBOpaa	You are asking a question that I am sure many brother - sisters at some point cross their minds.  So I will not say whether it is 'normal' or not.   However, it is an area of trouble that you do not want to enter.<br>  <br>  I am sure that just saying, 'don't do it' is not the answer that you are looking for.  You truly want to know more than just that.<br>  <br>  Let me just list four primary ones, of many more.<br>  <br>  1)  First, even if the act were one of 'mutual' choice - it would be one that sooner, or later, you would both regret.  It is highly likely that the 'relationship' between you both AS brother and sister would be damaged, possibly beyond repair.  You would not want that.  Plus, you both ARE at a stage in life that both of you are easily 'confused' by your own sexuality.  Currently, you both are being affected much, much more by puberty hormones than you want to admit, which makes takes away your ability to fully think this through about what its consequences could be in ALL respects.<br>  <br>  2) If your parents, or anyone else, inside OR outside your family were to find out - they would be hurt, mad, and confused about how to handle the situation at a level that would be Beyond words.  Also, if 'somehow' any of your friends were to find out - Your 'social' lives amongst your friends would be destroyed and you would be laughed at, teased, avoided, etc., etc.<br>  <br>  3) What 'happens' if she were to get PG - that is a whole nother story that there are not enough words for here.<br>  <br>  4) Lastly, it is 'incest' and there are laws against that - especially for you, because you are the oldest - you could end up in juvenile court and then, in a juvenile home until 18.<br>  <br>  Are those enough reasons of 'why not'.  I hope it makes you think twice and channel your hormones into the direction of a healthy 'boyfriend/girlfriend' outside relationship.<br>  <br>  Wish you the best.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	No, it is not normal.  <br>  <br>  What you are basically saying is that you want to sleep with your sister.<br>  <br>  That is wrong on so many levels, I don't have enough space to list them.<br>  <br>  Please find a girl outside your immediate family to crush on.  <br>  <br>  Stay away from your sister because the only thing that you will get is big trouble.

The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.<br>  <br>  The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Yahoo has revamped the profiles and the member search. Until recently you could enter <a href="http://members.yahoo.com/">http://members.yahoo.com/</a> to get to the membersearch, now you are being redirected to: <br>  <a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/intro/?s=209">http://profiles.yahoo.com/intro/?s=209</a> which asks you to create a new profile. <br>  <br>  At the bottom left of that page you'll see 2 buttons, 1 takes you to an official blog with explanations why and how the changes were made: <a href="http://www.yprofileblog.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yprofileblog.com/</a> <br>  <br>  The other one has tutorials about how the new profile system works: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/profiles/">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/profile...</a>

Note: you should sign out and back in again to make sure that the settings are working.

AA11004428	why is this in the yahoo! section?
AA10132204	In complete form, your question would be either "Are you a celebrity on YA?" or "Do you know of any celebrities on YA?"  Both would fall under the chat violations.  You should ask it like "What celebrities have participated on YA?".  Your question can be answered yes/no/idk a red flag for chat.  My version requires a factual answer.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	You should have specifically asked if any celebrities have been on Yahoo Answers. As written the questions looks like chatting. Here is your answer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_answe...    ? ??l???q ?|`|IRQfUb68aa	Maybe you're not allowed to know the people who answer!  But if you think you didn't deserve it, write a mail to Yahoo!|`|F4rD4HF0aa	when u first sign up for yahoo answer there is a big list of the thing u can not ask... but i am sure it's just someone being a *** and felt like reporting you|`|nrqWwQBXaa	its dumb but they think it chatting?|`|AA11252878	Chattiness was the reason why your question has been removed. It's already the most-violated rule of the Community Guidelines. Keep in mind questions like that don't belong here at all because they aren't of general knowledge material. This is never the way to exchange knowledge between other users. Besides, they're already a waste of other users' time.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Blocking in Messenger and blocking in YA are 2 different things. Currently, you have your YA profile set to private. So nobody can see your Q&A unless they are your YA contact or fan. If you allow fans, anybody can add you on YA and then see your Q&A. If you don't allow fans, then only your contacts can see your Q&A here.|`|AA10108021	Nobody will have access to your contacts, such as email, but only if you decide to have it blocked.

AA10132204	You can delete your Yahoo Answers Account in two ways, neither direct.<br>  <br>  First you can leave the account as it is for a few months without accessing it and it’ll be eventually deleted! But before that you’ll have to:-<br>  <br>  ?Make your Q&A ‘PRIVATE’,<br>  ?Set no Avatar and remove all ‘CONTACTS’ and ‘FANS’<br>  ?DISALLOW Fans and remove anything in the ‘’ABOUT ME’ column<br>  ?Remove your NICKNAME or name it ‘Blank’ (Anonymous), and <br>  ?CLOSE all links to your E-mail and other websites.<br>  <br>  <br>  Secondly you can Use this Link to delete your entire Yahoo account<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/acct/ho...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/acct/ho...</a><br>  <br>  Before deleting follow the above things (from the first point) and read the warnings carefully in the link given above.<br>  <br>  When you delete your Account all the questions you asked and answered will be available for the ‘Search’ and you cannot delete them. It now becomes a property of Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Terminating your Yahoo account means you will LOSE access to: Yahoo answers, Flickr, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Address Book, Yahoo notepad, Yahoo Briefcase, My Yahoo, and all Yahoo properties.|`|suPD7c3gaa	You don't delete your Yahoo! Answers account.  The only way you can cancel it is to cancel the entire Yahoo! account, which would include your Yahoo! mail and any and all Yahoo services you may be using.  Basically, what you do is simply stop coming here.  You can set your questions and answers to private so people can't see them by viewing your profile.  To do that, click on "My Profile" on the upper right, or your avatar to get to your profile. Then click "Edit My Info". You'll see the option to make your questions and answers private. When you do that, any Contacts or Fans you might have would still be able to view them. If you'd prefer they didn't, also select the option to not allow Fans or Contacts. This step would eliminate any Contacts or Fans you now have. Be sure to click "Preview" and "OK" to save your changes.  Then just don't come here anymore.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	Post a vulgar question or answer. They'll suspend the account which will effectively wipe out all the info.|`|AA11865915	It's kinda ironic that you would ask how to delete your Yahoo! Answers *on* Yahoo!

7u77AiBjaa	You have Yahoo account that is used to access various SERVICES like Yahoo! 360.<br>  <br>  Closing your entire Yahoo account gives you the best chance to completely remove your 360 space from the web. Closing a Yahoo account does cancel access (and for some removes associated content) to Yahoo services under that account. Otherwise, if you do not want to lose your Yahoo ID, your second-best option is content removal and permissions adjustment.<br>  <br>  So, here are your two choices:<br>  <br>  1) Go to <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...</a> and click the Account Deletion link. If you read through the text, you will find this will also delete all associated services for that account like Yahoo! Mail. I still recommend removing any content that you've added to your 360 before deleting your entire account.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If a COMPLETELY deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific).It's possible that you won't be deleted COMPLETELY from the user registration database until after 90 days.<br>  <br>  2) If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.
QFEFOaCRaa	PayPal is one of the most trusted and biggest online payment companies.  I use it for my online business.  They are extremely secure, and would never steal your money.  My password had to be really long and crazy.  Just calm down, PayPal is owned by e-Bay and both companies are very well recognized and reputable.  PayPal is better for you, as the company you are buying from never sees your credit card or bank account information. Happy Shopping

jKfV6DoOaa	I have already answered that question before in Yahoo!Answers. When you have a question you should really first check if there is not already an answer to that in Yahoo!Answers. <br>  <br>  Here is what I wrote before to someone with the same question. <br>  <br>  " That is easy. Just sing into your Yahoo!Messenger and put your mouse curser on your avatar and then it will show you a little error on the lover left corner of your avatar image. Click on that little error and a window will open where you can see your avatar. In that window click on "Display Image". It will open up the "My Display Image Window" and there click on the little circle "Share my picture" and then click on "OK" on the bottom. This will open up another window and there click on "Browse..." It will open another window called " Select a picture file". You can go then to where ever you have your picture that you want to use as your display picture. Click on that picture of your choice and then click on "Open" on the lower left corner. It will close the previous window and put the picture that you chose into the window " My Pictures". You will see your chosen picture on the top right. Then click on "OK" and it will close that widow and transfer your picture as your display picture in your Yahoo!Messenger right away. Have fun choosing a picture."<br>  <br>  And if you want to change your Avatar it works the same way except that you click in the "My Display Image" on "Share my Avatar" again and on the right on "Customize..." to change the look of your Avatar and then click on "OK" again and then you have changed your look of the Avatar. <br>  Just experiment with it. It's easy to figure out. Have fun.
