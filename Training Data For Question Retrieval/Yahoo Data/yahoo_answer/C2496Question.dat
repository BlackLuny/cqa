Passers-by on busy street corner   watch in amusement a   white faced mime in   self-imposed box, struggling   to find his way out   pressing gloved hands on   imaginary walls as they   slowly close in upon him   until his fingers find a break   and he pries himself out   for quick escape   they applaud his efforts   and continue to walk,   silently wondering    if their walls are   imaginary, too.

20090226095940AASKL2R	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Harry Potter and the Dusty Time Turner?	(I feel pretty stupid that I never thought of this before.) I read an article where the writer criticizes Harry Potter & co. about the Time Turner.      In 'Prisoner of Azkaban', Hermione uses the Time-Turner to take extra classes. Then Harry and Hermione use it to go back in time and save Sirius. And it is never used again.      Why? Go save Sirius when he dies for real, or Dobby, or Mad-eye, or any of the characters that die. It's a time machine. Heck, they even could've stopped Voldermort's resurrection or saved Harry's parents.      I know "time paradox", "fabric of space time", etc. But if you're using a time machine you obviously don't care about that stuff anyways so why not use it selfishly. Like when they saved Sirius the first time.   *If you use time travel for a silly reason like 'more school', you might as well use it for a good reason like 'saving lives' too.      Right?

20090226101703AAbbXzu	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Want to dance, don't know what to do with experience (not really wanting to teach)?	I began learning how to dance from about the age of 2, in ballet, tap and modern. As I got older the classes began to disappear one by one until I was left with tap, my favourite. In true X Factor sob story style, my tap teacher who is the reason I passed my last exam with flying colours actually died. The dancing school owner sold the school and it was never the same, especially without my tap teacher. I left soon after (at around age 17/18).      On and off I've taken up classes for fun, in anything from street dance to contemporary. I'm not proficient enough to be a professional I don't think, and I never progressed far enough to take I.S.T.D qualifications.      I'm now 23, a graduate with no job and desperate to pursue something I enjoy. I feel that I am too old to start pursuing anything like gymnastics or any sport really to competition level (my flexibility isn't what it used to be - lack of practice), and dancing was what I always enjoyed.      So my question is this - what can I do with my dancing that would take me beyond it just being a hobby, but wouldn't become a dull run of the mill job?

20090226102318AAY45mx	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you know anyone that has been forgotten?	FORGOTTEN            I've heard that the New England winters can take a toll on a man, but Ed's face was as weathered as the sun-bleached hull of a lobster boat that has been grounded for decades. A toothless smile lights up his face as he parks a Pall Mall into the corner of his dried-husk lips. "You see that that swingset over there"? I look in the general direction of his crooked finger, and all I see are the rotted remains of broken 4X4 posts. "I used to push my son Bobby so high on them swings, that somedays I swear he was gonna fall off and fly to the clouds!". He stares off in silent reflection of the ruins in the distance, as I ask "Where is Bobby now"? He kicks the dirt with an old boot and says "Bobby is a lawyer o'er in Bangor. I think I seen him round 'bout '89? I reckon he's a busy man". His droopy, weathered gaze searches the sky. "Side's, I guess when your bones is as old as mine, you got nothin' left to offer".          No draft on this one, I wrote it on the fly.       Have you ever seen someone like Ed? I'd never let my own dad down like that.

In the swing was a boy   With a watergun toy   On a hot summer's day in the breeze.      The mouse crept up.   The cat jumped down.   The dog woke up and ran around.   The small boy watched until 'twere done   And then he squirted the dog, who'd won.

We live and then die...what we do in between doesn't even matter. This is kind of comforting in a way, because if it all doesn't matter, then that gives us freedom to do whatever we want. Another part of me is not happy with my nihilism, and does want to find meaning and purpose in life. A part of me doesn't care if I work some clerical job for the rest of my life..and that's it. And then a part of me what's to do great things. How do I reconcile my nihilism?

20090226110216AAMOIlN	Arts & Humanities;History	Why do people try to tell me the civil war was in america was about states rights and not slavery?	Thats ludicrous. While the south did fight for states rights, so to speak, one of the 'rights' they wanted was their right to determine whether to have slavery or not. They made that clear, and that's why they so violently opposed Lincoln. Even during his election, the southern states threatened, "If Lincoln is elected, we will create a southern confederacy" Lincoln was a radical northern abolitionist. Slavery might not have been the only issue, but it was one of the big issues that sparked southern successions, was it not?

Whatif they've closed the swimming pool?   Whatif I get beat up?   Whatif there's poison in my cup?   Whatif I start to cry?   Whatif I get sick and die?   Whatif I flunk that test?   Whatif green hair grows on my chest?   Whatif nobody likes me?   Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?   Whatif I don't grow talle?   Whatif my head starts getting smaller?   Whatif the fish won't bite?   Whatif the wind tears up my kite?   Whatif they start a war?   Whatif my parents get divorced?   Whatif the bus is late?   Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight?   Whatif I tear my pants?   Whatif I never learn to dance?   Everything seems well, and then   the nighttime Whatifs strike again!          What's your favorite Shel Silverstein poem?

I have alwas had a keen interest in make up and have been told my a number of people that I should become a make up artist. The problem is that I don't know how to go about it. I'm 20, have 10 GCSE'S (A* - C) and 3 A Levels (French C, German D, RS D - not great I know, but my grades slipped because of depression). I have been unemployed for the past year (not on the dole because my parents have been very supportive so please no ''get off your *** you lazy scounger'' comments) because I suffer from depression and agrophobia. I intend to seek help for these issues, but I would like to know what are the possible routes availible to me for getting into make up artistry? I'm not interested in home distance learning because I don't believe I would get the practical experience.

The Whistler   How sweet and swift does the whistler sing,   Upon the verdant lands of melodious word.   The sweetened approach for the dawn of spring,   And the ripened song of a baby bird.      Blithesome tales of wooded land,   So thick and dark in slumbering heat.   With a turning face, he lifts a hand,   Farewell winter, and falls of sleet.      His working limbs that tread the earth,    To blanket the ground in printed feet.   He blows a tune of rapturous mirth,   In reply he hears the lungful tweet!      The sunlit pools of dappled light,   Cast golden rays upon his wizened cheek.   His love of branch, and blooming sight,   Over feathered birds with sharpened beak.      From his lips he cried the whistled song,   Moulded from lands of watered moss.   His crooked bones, from years are strong,   The canopy place through spring to cross.

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;   Be kind anyway.   If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;   Succeed anyway.   If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;   Be honest and frank anyway.   What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;   Build anyway.   If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;   Be happy anyway.   The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;   Do good anyway.   Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;   Give the world the best you've got anyway.   You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God;   It was never between you and them anyway.

I see you in my dreams , thus the reason I refuse to sleep.   Even if I go insane at least I wont see your face.   I trace each step from the moment we met, till this day .Since you said goodbye.I try to stay strong , try to tell myself you dont love me anymore.Pain I guess but Im so numb . I dont feel it anymore.I didnt want to kiss you that day , I didnt want to look into your eyes ...Ever ounce in my body fought and tried!The piece thats missing makes me shake and cry ..my soul has been screaming out LOUD for you ...but you havent answered the call...So I take this walk of life alone . Down a dark quiet road .Icy and cold I will never be the same , I will grow old and still be in love with you.

20090226115642AAhtmjF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Possibly too cliched and boring? What do you think?	"Catharsis. I like that word.       You might be surprised to hear this but I don't actually find empty threats intimidating. So yeah you can smile, go ahead. If you can even call that a smile. It looks like one sure, but I suppose if you words are so deceptive, your body must be an excellent liar too.       That explains a lot.       You are beautiful though, as much as it pains me to say. Not just pretty, or cute. Actually breathtaking. Breath. Another thing you took from me.       Admittedly, if someone were trying to imagine beauty itself, to picture genuine perfection, it would be pretty close to you. You have kind eyes. Had. Those frightened looks you'd feign to make me hold you. Now I see those were false too.       I used to think that mouth was so sweet, so gentle. Little did I know there was a razor blade hidden under that wet, insipid tongue. **** knows where that unholy piece of flesh has been. I don't really want to know. You never were too shy about putting it to work. It was more of a tool for you, like some kind of horrendous serpent searching for prey. Something to sink it's teeth into. Not for food. For pleasure.      So right now I'd say it's more of a sneer than a smile. A malicious grin say. Malice - I get it now. What kind of a sick joke is that. It cant be your real name. Malice. No that would be too ugly a word for you wouldn't it? Just like rape was too ugly a word for your father. How about molest? Abuse? Any takers? Didn't think so.      No. Those words are ugly too. Ugly and bitter, angry.       It wasn't like that...Right?"            Kane Roderique-Walker

20090226120137AAAAq0e	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think of my argument ?	If one has to be talented to be a pro athlete then how come Glenn Cunnigham was one of the greatest track runners of all time? He was severley injured as a child and he could barely walk. He was athletically handicapped but through great determination he became a famous track runner. Michael Jordan was cut from varsity when he was a sohpomore in high school. If he wasa talented player, he most likely wouldnt have been cut. His great determination made him great. Reggie Meller had leg deformities and he became a pro basketball player but there were tons of people without leg deformities that strived for the nba and didnt make it. Reggie's determination had to be what got him to the nba.         Doesnt that defeat the concept that a person needs to be talented to be a pro athlete?

However, I have this fear that they're not going to have an alternative day, and that I will lose the opportunity to audition. I've been really looking forward to this audition, and now I'm scared that they won't really have it and they're just saying that, but I can't "cancel" my class....the teacher is very strict, and we're only allowed a set number of absences.

20090226154413AAUS23j	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Philosophy question for ya guys?	I had this question in my class a while back and I saved it to my computer.. just wondering how you guys would answer it?      "Several years ago there was a criminal case I investigated involving a car accident. A woman (woman "A") was driving behind another car on a dark road at night. The person in the car ahead of her (person "B") suddenly made an illegal u-turn and her car hit that car in the rear-side. The police were called and they pulled both of these cars over to the side of the road to fill out paperwork/reports. However, the police pulled the cars over on a narrow shoulder at the base of a small hill, so that a car coming over the hill did not see them. The car coming over the hill was going 40 miles an hour over the speed limit and the driver (person "C") was legally intoxicated.He had been drinking at a friend's party, where they served him drinks and kicked him out when he got too drunk. His car then hit one of the cars that had been pulled over--pushing it into the woman "A" who had been pulled over by police. Woman "A" was critically injured with internal bleeding and brought to the Emergency Room. When told that she would need a blood transfusion , she stated that she was a Jehova's Witness and refused the transfusion. She died as a result of internal hemmoraging. The drunk/speeding driver was arrested and charged with negligent homicide as a result of this, so MY QUESTIONS ARE: 1)Who, IS responsible for the woman's death, and to what extent?--person"B", Person"C",his friends, Woman"A", the police, fate? 2) Is the driver (person "C") in fact guilty of negligent homicide? Would you agree with the skeptics that the nature of “causation” isn’t as clear as we sometimes think, or is there an obvious answer to who exactly is responsible for this chain of causation?"

20090225115722AANJpTU	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Rate my story preview please?	My story is about a young boy genius, who was teased in his early years of high school (not to mention ignored all through elementary school), and selfishly turned to cocaine to cure his depression. The title of the story is 'Misery Loves Cocaine', and the boy's name is Natsu Chou Kisu, which in Japanese mean Summer Butterfly Kiss. Here it goes, it's very long:::      "I went into that bathroom, that same, precious bathroom I always go in. No one was there: Most students at high school usually left this horrible place to eat their ‘fatty foods’ and smoke their ‘death sticks’ at lunch time. Although this school was the reason for my insanity, it was also the only place I could feel anywhere close to sane. I walked on the stained, tiled flooring, and I stopped in front of a stall that read ‘out of order’. Of course it was ‘out of order’, it was the drug house: A little stall of heaven, where teenagers like I could feel at peace with their selves and the world. I locked myself up tight in that cozy little stall, and dropped my book bag to the ground. Looking around the stall, you could definitely see that this was MY piece of heaven, and I had claimed it well. Strange, tripped out drawings of butterflies were all of the walls and the floor, done with markers, nail polish, and a few done with facepaint from Halloween.       I knelt down on the dirty ground, and reached into my bag. When I pulled out my hand again, I held a piece of paper, and a small plastic bag filled with my powder of joy: Cocaine. I put the paper on the closed toilet seat and poured the white dust carefully onto it, making sure to get it in as perfect of a line as possible. When I had it just the way I wanted it, I took out my own, personal, modified snorting device, and looked at the cocaine with hungry eyes. Sure, this high came with a price, but it was a small amount to pay for ten minutes floating high in the sky. With not even a slight pause, I snorted up the cocaine off of the paper, trying as hard as I could to not miss even a small particle of it.      After a little while, I could start feeling it kick in. It felt to me like rain, pouring off my skin. I forgot about how horrible my life was, if only for a few minutes, leaning back against the walls, drawing even more butterflies all over the infected walls. The powered corrupted my brain, and I leaned my head back, closing my eyes. I stayed perfectly still, drinking in each little drop of happiness my addiction brought to me. Every time I snorted my stash, I felt like a butterfly myself: Slowly drifting, too stupid to know my fate, and the fate of the world. Floating on and on, without a care in the world… until, of course, the crash. When I finally burned out, I felt like I was that same butterfly, only mounted up on the wall, dead.      I felt trapped when I looked at my watch, noticing there was only about twenty minutes left before this bathroom because inhabited with many people. I growled loudly to no one and nothing in particular, and closed my bag. I left my stall, closing it behind me, and threw my bag onto the line of silver sinks. My reflection in the sinks was distorted, and made me look like some kind of monster. Really, I was, wasn’t I? I was a cocaine addict. That’s as horrible of a monster as I’d ever get. A pathetic, fifteen year old cocaine addict in the twelfth year. But oh god, what a high."

20090226153154AApJ0RO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What song reminds you of a poem without allusions to the actual poem?	The song Anna Molly by Incubus reminds me of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe because the girl (Anna Molly) is an anomaly that doesn't exist and he is hallucinating about this perfect virtual girl. Yet, in The Raven, Poe as the narrator is hallucinating about the Raven actually being real. Somewhat similar since both involve hallucinating, depression and a woman.
20090226153501AA6JlOq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	URGENT! Please help with my english homework, i have to write a short story but don't know where to go with it?	This is what so have so far... and don't worry it's not as long as you think, you can skip to the end if you want.   "Smile.” My aunt Judith held the camera to her face and I leaned towards my Grandfather. He held his arm around me and I plastered a smile onto my face. We stayed frozen like that while my aunt fumbled with the camera. I kept that grin there the whole time and finally the camera flashed and I was released. My mouth ached from smiling and I rubbed my cheeks sureptitously.    “Oh, Merideth,” I grimaced, only Judith called me that and I hated it. To get her back I called her Judith when she wasn’t around even though she had all her nieces call her Aunty Jude. Blech, she was so full of herself and she tended to over state things and her sentences where so wordy. “I LOVE that necklace. WHERE did you get it? Really I MUST know.” See what I mean? She also had a tendency to talk loudly which made it hard to say anything and be heard.   “Thanks. I love it to, it’s my favorite.” The necklace I was wearing at the time was a simple leather cord with a painted tiger face hanging off it. I loved it because I felt it was simple yet elegant, like me. I don’t know if that sounds snotty or not, I’ve never shared that thought with anyone.   Just then the waiter walked up and said in that falsely polite voice that all waiters have to use.    “May I interest anyone in dessert?” Really, I feel bad for those poor people. No matter how annoying the customer is they have to smile and nod and do whatever the person asks. I wouldn’t be able to stand that. It’s hard enough for me to resist telling Judith what I think of her. I’m very independent and I always say what I think. If I set my mind on something you can bet I’m gonna get it done.   “None for me thank you very much. I’m QUITE full up with your EXQUISITE food.” Judith’s loud voice was first to answer of course and I rolled my eyes. I opened my mouth to ask for the chocolate cheese cake but my mother shook her head and said quickly, ”I believe we’re all ready for the bill.” The waiter nodded, smiled and headed towards the kitchen. I know times have been hard lately but I thought that my last night at home before I head off to a college half way across the country would allow for a little more freedom.       This is just a rough draft and i know the writing isn't perfect. It is supposed to be a short story and i don't know where to go with it. I have to have some kind of conflict, what i want is for her to have to deal with someone who she doesn't like, It was gonna be Judith or i could add a cousin or something. The main issue is how do i get it to move quickly to the start of the conflict and what is the conflict about? Could you help? thanx

Im not sure what to think but i just need something to hand in to school because everyone needs to submit something to a writing contest.   Thanks for your input   --------------------------------------...   Anxiety:      Have you ever lived a life with shaking hands?   or perhaps the feeling of your heart beating too fast.   I have been through it all    and have found myself at last.      I remember the ways to find my escape.   Self harm or self love were both hard to take.   I remember the faintness I felt everyday   to enter this horrible world of dismay.      My heart beat kept escalating. Fast as can be.   All I wanted then, was to be set free.   The world was the enemy, I felt so afraid.   Sometimes I’d rather be stuck in a grave.      I remember the feeling, I would never get well.   Planning to end it, for this earth was hell.   The escape couldn’t work, the scars were still there.   So I just crept in bed,  gasping for air.      All I wanted was just to not feel this manic.   As well as the ever increasing panic.   Humans were cruel, they could not comprehend   The perspective I had, I was at my wits end.      I never found God, instead freedom I found   Knowing that I was homeward bound.   The missed opportunities may be lost,   and the pain I had , never can be forgot.      Yet here I am. Alive as can be.   The shaking has almost ceased to be,   My heart beat stays in time, relaxed and slow.   I no longer feel the fear, no more.      Now I can be all I dreamed I would be.   For I no longer feel the pain of anxiety.
20090226154712AAihPXE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The Loss of Love by Countee Cullen poem?	How would you analyze this poem?       http://project1.caryacademy.org/echoes/p...       I sincerely thought the speaker was a woman looking back in her life as a young child. When "her" and "she" is used in the 1st stanza, I thought it was referring to love. When it talks about the cows and orchards, I thought it was about a child and the loss of innocence because of the work she had to go through. She was forced to grow up fast due to that feeling of being neglected. And the last stanza is obvious about how death is even better than not being loved.      So I find out that my analysis is incorrect and the speaker is actually about a guy and his love.      Why is my analysis so far out? Is this bad?

A Bleeding Sun   Where streams of strict obedience   beholden in broken hands   of quiet passion run      through cracked fingers   once curled into warm palms   of a father's love   neither floats nor lingers      hardened feet breaking the backs of leaves   tinted orange---from where   the Sun's rays hath weaved      on strong shoulders he heaves   the heavy burden of perfection   under heavy rain   he sees---the dampened voice      of his somber reflection.

20090226154218AAOii5a	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me!!! I need help writing from ANYONE who sees this...PLEASE answer!?	okay, I'm 13 and trying to write a book. I'm also a huge Twilight fan so whatever I think about writing is something to do with vampires and stuff, and I'm getting real paranoid about it! I've asked a few questions about my book so far and all of them came up with " it was fake". I thought of only one scene ( not the beginning) and here it is: if it's a romance, at one point, the main guy will try to save the girl by grabbing her and accidentally falling down a cliff in the process. that's what I have and it already sounds Twilighty to me, that's me being paranoid again! also, I'm trying not to use vampires, but to me there's no other hot/cute mythical or fantasy creature ( I'm trying fantasy because that's my favorite genre). If any of you guys have written a book before, I would also like ideas as to how I would find inspiration? do I have to study my setting or something?And don't worry if you haven't written a book, I just kind of need help as to what sounds interesting and how I can try to stay away from plagiarizing ( from Twilight, the plot not words)! HELP!?!?!
20090226150609AAAeXjP	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Thoughts on human rights?	So i had to write a paper in philosophy. I was given the situation of a celebrity who needed to go to rehab. This star refused. Should the celebrity be forced to go to rehab? I was asked to evaluate Kant and Mill's reactions. I said that Kant would be against such force because of his nonconsequentialist views (ends do not justify the means). I was torn a little more by Mills. I said he would be for the forcible action due to the Utilitarian view of "greatest" happiness. This would be because the gain of the music. However, Mills also has his book "On Liberty". Do you think the musician's abuse violates the harm principle, and thus is worthy of action? I said yes, what are your thoughts?

20090225115255AAm12iN	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	What to do about music lessons?	I've been playing violin since I was 4 years old, and now I'm 13.   I've wanted to quit violin now, since I was about 11.    I mean, I don't want to be throwing away my music, but I don't really want to play much anymore.   One of the reasons is because of my private lessons. No matter how hard I try, I can't focus for the 45 minutes that my lesson is. I always feel myself flitting away and getting bored, and often tapping my foot like there's no tomorrow. Whenever I try to talk to my mom about this, she just starts yelling at me, saying basically these words to me: "You've been playing violin for 9 years now, and you have talent. I don't care if you can't pay attention for that long, just TRY HARDER! I'm not paying for these lessons to just throw the money away, missy."    Another reason I want to quit is because I don't think I'm good enough. Even though I've been playing for 9 years, I can't seem to feel as dedicated and in love with the instrument as some other people feel, and thus, I don't feel good enough. In NYSSMA, I'm only a level 4, a low one at that! One of my best friends has been playing for 8 years, and she's so extremely dedicated, she practices for literally, like, 3 hours a day! I feel so inferior compared to her, and it makes me really sad. I try to practice an hour and a half every day, but I can't get into it without thinking about how good my friend is, or getting bored of it.      Third reason, sometimes I just don't feel the music, and I don't know why. Whenever my mother listens to me play, she criticizes every wrong note, and she then asks me "Oh my god, Adrienne Skye. Can't you feel the music and hear the wrong notes?" and she says this in such a mortified tone, I feel like a dog being scolded.      I want to quit, but I'm afraid that once I do, I'll feel the actual need to play again! Also, I don't want to throw away my supposed "talent" my mom says I have, and I don't want to have wasted the years of money from all my lessons.      What should I do!!!!!!!!!!????
20090226150039AAgN30x	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.       How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

Lately I've been hanging out with a bunch of people who are older than me, and I feel like they've read so many interesting non-fiction books (or fictional books with huge philosophical undertones).  Every time they start talking they sound so smart!  I really want to read something like that; something that isn't as mindless as the silly novels I've read in the past.  Help?      Thanks in advance...

20090226143919AAzEBd6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What genre is it? Literature list?	Ok this is a homework asignment and some of these we have not even read in class yet. but i want to check with you the ones i have and haven't read. so please fill in any of the blanks you know! and correct me if these books are under the wrong category. The categories to choose from, btw, are: Science fiction, fantasy, myth, legend, folktale, fable, realistic fiction, non fiction, historical fictoin, drama [btw they do not list authors on here]   [also if u know why it is the genre it is state that.]      Brian's Song- Nonfiction, because it is an event that happened in real life   Fever- Historical Fiction, because it happens during the yellow fever epidemic and george washington is the current president.   The Cliffhanger- ???   Nancy Drew- ???   Goose Bumps- idk, do they mean a story or the series?   Dark They were golden eyes- science fiction, because there are martians and earthlings living on mars.   Freak the mighty- ???   The outsiders- realistic fiction, because it's about the uprising of tension between one side of society and the other.   Harry Potter- Ooh, isn't this fantasy, because everything they do is imposibble, such as flying on broomsticks and casting spells?   Serial Garden- I think this is fantasy, because everytime the boy sings a song, he shrinks to small size and can enter his carboard garden model which comes to life.   Pic- ???   Titanic- Nonfictoin, because it is an event that happened in real life.   Elanor Roosevelt-??   Thesus and the Minotaur- Isn't this a folktale or a fable, about the one son of the king who goes to fight the minotaur off?   Narcissus- myth, because he is only in love with himself and echo who is cursed by herra the godess can only repeat what he says.   Young Arthur- Legend, beccause the story may be true but it has been exaggerated somewhat.   Ant and The Grasshopper- err, fantasy? idk because its aboutr a grasshopper who doesnt store any food during the summer for the winter and instead fools around while the ant works hard, and then in the winter when the ant moves his last grain of corn in, the grasshopper begs for food and the ant scolds him for not working hard and says no.   "Waters of Gold"- idk if i read this. is this about the moon snail?who feeds the farmer every day until one day he tries to touch her so she has to leave?      thanks!

Woman Accused of Trading Children for Pet Bird      Donna Greenwell, a 57-year-old woman from Louisiana, has been accused of swapping two young children to a family looking to adopt for a pet cockatoo and $175 in cash. Greenwell's relationship to the 5-year-old boy and 4-year-old girl is unclear.      Police became aware of the situation after receiving a phone tip and approached the Romero family at a local fast food establishment and took the children into custody. The Romeros, along with Donna Greenwell, were charged with aggravated kidnapping.      The Romeros, who traded the bird and cash for the children, had "good intentions" and just wanted to take care of the kids according to detective Keith Dupre. The Romeros were free on $5,000 bond while Greenwell remains in jail on $100,000 bond.

Too childish?   2) Miles? Too average?   3) Ezekiel?    4) Donald (Don for short) Remind you too much of Donald Duck?   5) Isaac?

20090226113116AAfJlfQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	If you made one of your favorite books into a movie...?	What book would it be?   What actor/actress would you chose to play the main character/s?      I think I'd make Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk. That is one of his most under-appreciated books. And, since more people see movies rather than read, I think it'd be a good way to get that story out there. Plus, if you stuck to the book very closely [like they did with Fight Club] it'd be an interesting movie.      I'd chose Phillip Seymour Hoffman for the main character. He's pretty perfect for the role.

To just give it all up and pack things away and move would be sure to be heart breaking for anyone.

Well, in the story, he's having trouble with a dream that predicted a horrific event. A month has passed, and he's still obsessing over it. How can I write this so it doesn't sound kind of 'feminine'? I don't think guys tend to obsess over stuff like that.      It's like having a nightmare that clings to you all day - but for a month. How would you feel about this if you were a guy?      This guy (Liam) is trying to take his mind off it, so he's going over to a friend's house. I was going to make them play video games and eat pizza, but is that a little unimaginative? I kind of want 'stereotypical teen boy' here.      What do guys talk about when they hang out? What do they do?         Also - a general writing question - how do I stop the story from dragging on?

I only got halfway through, and felt that alot of the middle part of the book could easily been cut out....it wasnt helping the story to get anywhere. Seems like Paollini just enjoyed writing it for the pure fact that he felt like god himself, creating a whole world with histories and its own language. But why would I give a damn. I just want to hear the story, not be impressed that youve pulled another Tolkien.

20090226171208AAUvcJ3	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Please give me your take on this...?	I especially don't understand the first sentence.      “I acknowledge and understand that there are parallels in the systems between humanity and the natural world. The systems within the world of plants, animals, trees, rocks and the atmosphere all contribute to the overall understanding of life process and the principle of cause and effect. The imbalance in one system ultimately affects the other. The natural world celebrates our healing as it means greater opportunity for increased balance and bio-diversity. Both systems strive for balance in their own manner, whether it is of mind, body, spirit, or emotion. Humanity and the environment are stewards of each other.”      Thanks! : )

Dawn's peaceful, luminous blue   Intensified with the day   As did happiness,   Blue... bluer... bluest,   White puffs of delight,   Joy overflowing,      Until sunset   Wrapped us in tender pink   And we fused in a    Passionate magenta goodbye,   Earth-soul and cosmetic-soul   Bursting with beauty.   When night came,   A baby moon   Laughed sideways in the dark.   I laughed back And thought:      Partway across the world,   Your sky is filled with   The same golden laughter,   And hoped that you,   Twinkling Blue Eyes, saw and heard,      So that somehow we three    Were joined in our gladness,   Each in our on space, Together apart,   Distance meaningless.      And I slept in a world   Full of smiles.

This is just a shot in the dark, but I'm trying to remember a book from when I was a child.  It was probably published anywhere from 1980-1995.  It had really well done illustrations.

I just remember being amazed by the illustrations and I really would like any help in finding out what book(s) I'm remembering.  Any suggestions of children's books published in that time frame, or perhaps earlier but not later, that vaguely resemble what I'm referring to would be great.  Thanks a lot!
