20090308072402AAcXEjJ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	White plume of smoke from exhaust, normal condensation or clue to a problem?	I just bought this 2004 Mazda6 S and it test drove great, drove it down 3 hours to my home and had no issues. However just yesterday (day 4) I had a little scare when I had just started it up, drove about 3 miles or so, and was idling at a stop light. I looked back and there was a plume of white smoke filling the air around the back of my car. Later that evening after the car was sitting cold for 2-3 hours I started it and instantly got the white plume again, I stuck my head in it and took a whiff and didn't smell anything potent.       Anyways I called a guy who sold me the car (carmax salesman, who has actually be very right about everything he has told me so far including prices at other dealers and everything, I was actually surprised a salesman was being so honest after I checked on his info) and he told me that this is normal and is caused by condensation (yesterday was the first warm day in a few weeks). I also noted that googling this issue with other Mazda6 owners seems to be slightly common issue.       The engine seems to be running fine and it has only happened those two times and it isn't constant at all. Should I be worried? Does anyone else have this happen on their cars? I never experienced it before with a car so I am unsure of what the deal is. The plume of smoke sort of hangs in the air for a while and drifts away making me think it might not be all water vapor. Anyways... please advise.

20090308054529AAha2TD	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car making very strange noise, what could it be?	For the past few months my 1997 Subaru Legacy Brighton AWD has been having some trouble starting, when I turn the key to Start I hear a loud click from under the hood, and it doesnt start. Usually after about 5 or 6 tries it does start. Today though, I went to start it and It started fine in the morning and a few hours later I started it again and I started hearing the clicking but this time the engine was on and running and it sounded like the car was turning over, when it was already running! Then I immediately turned the key to OFF but car would not shut off. It just sputtered and sounded like it was going to stall but it would not shut off no matter what I did. I turned the key back to the ON position and the engine started right back up as if I had put the key in the START position! Could this be the work of a faulty starter? I touched the starter after I was able to shut the car off (after a few minutes) and it was very very hot. It was a very strange and nerve wracking experience and I hope someone has an answer for me. Thanks

I've had the truck for ~almost~ a year, and it's never done this before (and we've gotten plenty of rain, btw).

It continued THROUGH the starting/backing, and is still going, though the truck's turned off.   Of course this is happening on a Sunday...  Help?

The dealership never mentioned it to me either (it's a certified Mazda dealership).  However, I see that it's common in the '04-06 models. I've heard mixed reactions as to whether this was corrected after those years. There was an engine recall for the '04-06 to fix it, but I don't know if the problem still exists. Is there a guideline in the owner's manual to help me avoid this problem?

What documents do we need to complete? Should I just call the local DMV for that? Any advice in simple terms from someone who's done this before... please help!

First and most annoying the speedometer and the fuel gauge doesn't work but the tach and temp does. when you step on the brake some idiot lights come on and others go off. You have to keep turning the lights on and off to get the lights to come on. The headlights always come on but the marker and dash lights don't unless you keep turning it on and off. All these problems are probably caused by the same thing I'm guessing but I thought I'd check if anybody has run into this with theirs before I spend a small fortune at the shop.

Since arriving here, my windows are repeatedly and stubbornly grimy in my car. I clean the inside, outside etc. only to find them dirty again the very next day. I've tried windex and it end up streaky. I tried something mild like the window cleaner that comes out when you pull the lever deal inside the car and it doesn't cut it.

20090308080908AAXlPBp	Cars & Transportation;Boats & Boating	Johnson Outboard, 90 hp; what could it be?	The motor sounds like it isn't getting enough gas.  We've changed the fuel lines, spark plugs, Primer Ball, gas tanks, gasoline, and the clip from the hose to the tank (can't remember what it is called).  While driving, it's fine for a few minutes, then starts powering down.  If you squeeze the primer ball, at first, there's air, but once gas gets in it, the motor starts running fine.      Other than the fuel pump, is there anything else we could check?

20090308083323AA3GLrH	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Whats wrong with my Chevrolet truck?	I have a 2000 Chevrolet K2500 with a 4L80E transmission and there is a problem with the shifting. When Im driving highway speeds and my truck faces some resistance (i.e, hills, stiff wind), the truck will downshift and not shift up again. All of the other gears will shift just fine except overdrive. Then, when I shut the truck off for a couple minutes, and restart it, its almost as though nothing happened, shifting just fine. I have done valve bottle work using a TransGo kit, replaced the front and rear speed sensors and still nothing. My next guess is torque converter. The truck used to have a 5th wheel behind it and that is my reason for guessing torque converter. The lead tech at our local dealership suggested a replacement transmission but, thats $3200 so, anyone have any suggestions or ideas?

20090308083406AAFeLqC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	98 Grand Am - car shakes and  backfires while stopped.  Potential causes?	Hello.      I have a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am (3.1, V6, automatic). At times (not always) the car will shake violently (like a bucking horse) and the RPM meter will fluctuate rapidly when the car is stopped (it can happen before moving out of Park, also - not just in Drive). Following this, the car will give a loud backfire and then be fine for a while.      This usually occurs shortly after the car has just been started up after sitting a while, and after it occurs once or twice, it won't occur again until the next time it's started up. The last time it happened, I believe I heard a small clicking/shifting noise from under the hood.      The car has all new spark plugs and wires, also, and behaves perfectly fine other than this - it doesn't shake after its episodes where it feels like its about to die and then backfires, and its a really quiet car, overall.      Any ideas on what could be the cause?

20090308085612AA4GDyI	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Drivers should ALWAYS warm up their car's engine for about two minutes before driving off. Right or wrong?	I'm going to defer to all you mechanics and car junkies out there who might know more about the subject - I really know diddly-squat about auto mechanics (my expertise is Venezuelan women, ha ha).      OK, basically I have a rule for myself to always idle the engine for about 2 or 3 minutes before driving off, to allow the engine (and more importantly, the oil) to warm up.       I live in Phoenix, so cold weather is not really an issue for me. But if I lived somewhere like Minneapolis, I would definitely be warming up the engine for about 10 minutes before going on my way.      And even on very hot days here in PHX, I still believe in warming up the engine for at least a minute to get that oil lubing those cylinders.       The only time I don't do a warm-up is if the engine is already warm, like for example if I've just pulled in to a mini-mart and I'm inside the store for only a few minutes before coming back to my car.       So how come more people don't do this? I've heard that most of the wear and tear on a car engine happens wirhin the first few minutes after start-up. The reason for this must be because people floor their gas pedal and drive at 60, 70 mph less than a minute after start-up, so the oil hasn't had a chance to circulate.
