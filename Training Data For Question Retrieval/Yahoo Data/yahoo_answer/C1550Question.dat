20090128183307AADfaZh	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Have you ever had just a really bad day that made you cry?	Yes. And today was that day...Everything added up and just made me finally pop. I have been going to bed around midnight every day. And I have to wake up at 6. My homework has been hell. I start at 6 and don't end until hours later. I don't eat at school and I am getting nauseated and dizzy every day. And the cherry on top of everything is that my girlfriend isn't responding to any of my texts and I'm worried that something bad happened to her. (I know she isn't mad at me or anything because this morning we were texting and everything) So my mom started fighting with me and then my dog bit me and that was like the last straw. I just broke down when she left. Right now tears are in my eyes because I still have so much work to do for just one class and then I have a bunch of tests coming up. And one that I have to make up. I just want to crawl under a rock and not come out until school is done with.

20090128183902AAlPsdG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was George Lucas Nuts?	Ok, George Lucas made star wars and in case you didn't know made anakin skywalker out to be like Jesus. Which means christs teachings were of the dark side. This is a common christian belief that christs teachings are of Beelzebub. It is said to cause men to lose their souls, that we should only hold fast to the blood. Now when considering this are these people nuts. In light of this would you join the dark side of the force, or go by the jedi code.       P.S. Not the first story like this many stories have metaphorical symbolism of such things you idiots       To Name a Few:      Huckle Berry Finn   Don Quixote   The Scarlet Letter   Alvin and The Chip Monks   The Carpenter and The Walrus    Jim Morrison Albums   Pink Floyd Albums   Beetle Albums   Ozzy Osborne    Metalica Albums   Alice and Wonder Land   Grimms fairy Tales    Peter Pan   Balthazar    The Silver Chalice   Harry Potter    The list goes on and on and on we will stop here for time purposes      Note: Dream interpretation has been used and common symbolism constructed by leading literary experts with a P.H.D in several books. One major one is Tony Crisp.  This type of universal art of language has been in use since the Renaissance era you idiots

20090128185017AAcQ2tZ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Aryan and Dravidian conflict resumes after 5000 years?	I am wondering whether this Aryan and Dravidian conflict has resumed after 5000 years since the great Indus Civilisation. Though many have disputed and refuted that Aryan Invasion is a myth, but now seeing the present scenario in India it looks like Aryan Invasion is true.      If you look at the present Tamil genocide, the entire Tamil population is against Srilankan government and the entire Brahmin population and Aryan influenced north Indians support Srilankan govt. Both the parties have completely different view on the present war against Tamils. Even in TamilNadu, the Brahmin community support Srilankan govt's stand while the real non-brahmin Tamils support Tamil community and Tamil freedom fighters.       How do you look at this? Who is going to win?

This is in regards to the wave of gay bashing on this site and the way christians are saying "Hey its not my problem talk to the man upstairs".      Don't you at least have at least show SOME empirical evidence before you use it as a catch-all to get away with bashing people and pretending your stuff stinks less than someone else's?      Can you show me a Creator who condones the game modern-day Christian hypocrites play. Anybody?      Case in point:   Pastor Rick Warren says gays are as bad as pedophiles yet he admits he is addicted to internet porn. I'll never get over that one.      You say God has "standards" which is a nice way of saying you are better than someone else because of your religion.      Funny, Al Qaida says the exact same thing!      Yes Al Qaida does put up the same type of absolutist wall.      I am sorry. It has nothing to do with you, but xians tell some of the most mean-spirited lies I have ever seen. The way the excuse themselves from responsibility for their bigotry via God is truly appalling.         Can I at least see some proof that gives christians a blank check to "sin" and "repent" as often as they wish and also be not sorry for other "sins" yet holds others as beneath them. Any proof at all?

Science seem only focus on the outer aspect of thing. There is no real way of science to produce the conscious experience of a lion, they can see it brain chemistry and stuff, but it cannot get in the lion, to see what it experience is like.

The candidate is a student graduated *** laude in X (class 3) in the X. Now the candidate has concluded her thesis dealing medical English through an analysis of a corpus of research articles. The candidate has conducted her work in a serious way, in full independence, showing a deep interest in the topic and going beyond its obligations to student by participating in a conference on the topic. She showed precision, attention to detail and desire for knowledge. Her curriculum studiorum shows excellent results achieved in disciplines related to English language and literature, a proof of the great interest which the candidate has for the language and culture of the United Kingdom. I support the nomination of the candidate to the position of Italian-speaking assistant at English schools. I believe that a practical and full immersion experience like this can help her broaden her cultural horizons, make her grow personally and professionally in her future work as an English teacher.         It's important, it's for a job

Thanks         Data Analysis (cont’d)   The mean GTF for all subjects was used to predict pressure waveforms from the volume waveforms. The agreement between predicted and measured waveforms was quantified by the root mean square (RMS) difference between the 2 signals. In addition, we measured the height of the IP and compared changes in IP in the predicted and measured waveforms after NTG administration. The IP was defined as the point immediately preceding the second peak of the waveform (occurring in early diastole), at which the first derivative of the volume signal was maximum and was expressed as a percentage of the waveform amplitude.    Statistical Analysis   Results are presented as mean±SD. ANOVA (for repeated measures where appropriate) was used to compare differences in IP and RMS errors between the groups and waveforms. A value of P<0.05 was taken as significant.

Sorry I'm going to see it next week so I'm super psyched :)      Anyway my question is as follows...       I'm thinking of changing my Avatar to something more groin grabbingly exciting. At the moment it is merely a rough facsimile of my face but it doesn't stand out from the crowd.      I was wondering what people though would be a good idea, my first instinct was to get a picture of C Montgomery Burns (my namesake) up there but then I thought meh not sure.      Bear in mind I'm not a extrovert bisexual so not too many rainbows and unicorns unless they are exceptionally cute. Also I'm not into anime so nothing like that, and I cant draw so I shouldn't put anything of my own making up there.      Any input appreciated.      Thanks a doodle in advance :)

20090128170732AAvNZF1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some Christians say that full immersion baptism is necessary when the bible doesn't teach it?	I always hear this argument about how baptism has to be full immersion (you can't just sprinkling the water over top of the head), otherwise it's not a real baptism. Quite frankly I don't think it matters, but it looks to me that scripture actually more supports the action of 'sprinkling' the water instead of dunking someone under water. Allow me to explain:      I was reading Hebrews 10:22 and it says this:      "Let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water." (the apostle uses the word 'sprinkle' in association with 'washing' which is a clear indication that he's talking about baptism (See: Acts 22:16; 1 Cor 6:11; Eph 5:26; Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 3:21).        Now read:  Hebrews 9:19    (which is referencing Ex 24:6- as well as Lev 14:4, 7; Num 19:6, 18 and Ex 24:7)       Next, read Hebrews 12:24      It appears to me that the apostle is making a correlation between the salvation that comes with believing in Jesus (which includes baptism) and the 'sprinkling' of blood in the sacrifice.  Whereas an animal was the source of the blood in the Old Covenant, Jesus is now the source of blood in the New Covenant (The Lamb of God).      So I cross referenced this with the Old Testament and found an interesting prophecy in Ezekiel 36:25:      "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols."      So do you still think that baptism by full immersion is the ONLY way a person should be baptized?  If so, please demonstrate how your view is biblical.

20090225151510AA0Viab	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"The Kingdom is within you." Is that the real gospel from the words of Christ himself?	And I realize that evangelical theologians are busy trying to change that verse from "within you" to "among you,"       but considering the original translation from KJV and the Catholic Bible and the NIV..... is the "Kingdom is within you" the real good news that Christ himself was preaching?      He supported this statement when he said: "I am in the Father, you are in me and I am in you."      And of course this puts the real gospel right in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount when Christ gave the way when he said: "Let thine eye be single."      And I realize that when I tie together things Christ himself said, I will get many who say "huh?" As if they never thought that Christ would be giving out his own message in everything he was saying. When the gospel is right, then everything he says fits together. (more context on my biography)      So is the Kingdom within you or not?

20090128182253AArLaxP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could this Bible translation be wrong?  Or is their definition wrong here?	Didn't the Bible's definition of homosexual really mean "heterosexual" men who raped men? For humiliation?  In reference to the story of Sodom & Gomorrah, if the words "to know" actually did mean "to rape" or "have sex with", why would Lot offer his two virgin daughters to the mob outside who wanted "to know" his guests? If they strictly wanted to "rape" or "have sex" with men as homosexuals, why didn't he offer the mob his sons?? Wouldn't that have made more sense?    Personally, I see the story as heterosexual men who just wanted to humiliate strangers and to show hatred and/or dominance. It doesn't sound like typical homosexual behavior to me. Educated people understand that "rape" is more about power than sex, regardless of the sex of the victim.

I've liked this girl since    4th grade now im in 8th grade.   I told her last year I liked her she was fine with it. and didnt mind. but then her friend saw our IM's and our conversations and her friend told the whole school i liked her. so then me and her fought for awhile cuz she blamed me for everyone finding out. but then we made up and she said sorry. But on dec 17 2008 we were having a nice conversation and then all the sudden she blocked me on myspace and took me off her friends list. and i thought it was just maybe a little pms or something so i waited and still she didnt unblock me so come january still not unblocked so i texted her on jan 7th and told her i was sorry for whatever i did. and that i wanted to know why she blocked me and what i did wrong and she texted me back saying "no you didnt do anything wrong" and so i texted her and said "then why?" and i never got a reply back even after i sent it a second time.      So now ive been really upset. im just not functioning right. I really love this girl shes everything to me. and even though shes straight and doesnt like me the same way i still want to be a friend and be there for her no matter what. because i love her.      my therepist told me im showing signs of deppression and that the only way im going to feel better is to talk to her again. But I dont know how. i need her back in my life.   what do i do??? Please help!!!       also i cant go and talk to her one on one in person becuz her friends would have a cow. and it would never happen. so it would have to be over text message or a note to her.

20090225151645AA6lBbX	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do Western guys like Oriental girls?	I quite often see Western guys and Oriental girls hanging out together.   Some of the girls are as beautiful as European or American girls, but some of them are not really attractive - They have small, sharp eyes,  which are typical of NE Asian women who have never undergone cosmetic[plastic] surgery.   Far be it from me to insult Oriental girls, I really want to know why Western guys, if not all, like Chine, Japanese or Korean girls.   ( Actually, I'm also from North-East Asia.)   For example, Nicholas Cage, the actor, is also married to a "typical" Korean woman, who is not very attractive.   (Well, he could have been attracted by her other aspects.)   And the Chinese-American actress, Lucy Liu is not really beautiful, from our Oriental point of vew.   Of course, many Oriental girls also perfer Western guys, who are usually taller than Oriental guys they can see every day in the street.   On the other hand, Western girls normally don't have any interest in Oriental guys, while the Oriental guys might have fantasy about long-legged and gorgeous Western girls.   In fact, it's not easy to see pairs of Oriental guys and Western girls in the street.   I'd say that Western girls are a lot more beautiful than Chinese, Japanese and Koran girls.   And in addition, if any of you Western guys imagine that all the Oriental girls are as faithful and dedicated to their husbands or boyfriends as Madam Butterfly (appearing in Puccini's opera), I would like to say to you "Dream on! And the days are gone when they would kneel down in front of their husbands. They live in the 21st century. And many of them are ready to break up or divorce if their boyfriends or husbands are fired from their jobs."   Please, bear in mind that Western girls are gorgeous.

Theres about an office of just under 60 of us.   I'm not convienced the gay person pays much attention 2 my jewellery...I was hoping he would say something (so i could talk 2 him about it) but hasn't even brought it up.   No-1's ever questioned me about these items (i've been wearing them for about a month now) either at home or work but GBLT community in general, do i make myself obvious this way or is it simply a case of str8 people not blinking an eye lid and probs thinking 'Oh shes just wearing the same rainbow jewllery again?'

20090128171445AA0xgJz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Did I make the right choice?	Ok. So on Jan. 9 this guy asked me out. I knew him a little bit but not a whole lot. Before he asked me out he went out with these other 2 girls one before the other and they always told me things like he was cheating on me, or he was going to break up with me. When on the other hand all his guys friends told me about how he liked me so much and how he always talked about me. Obviously I just ignored the girls cause I was sure they were just trying to break us up. I really really like him a lot but every time I tried to ask him about these things he would tell but he didn't always look at me. So I finally broke up with him last Monday (i know only 2 weeks) but I was so fed up of everything people were telling me cause it was something new every day almost. And when I tried to talk to him he would get mad and not talk about it that long and it's not like I was accusing him! After I did break up with him, his best friend was like he still really likes you and all this stuff and i'm kinda regretting breaking up with him now. I heard him and this girl talking (not flirting) and she was like omg she's gorgeous(talking about me) and he was like, that's besides the point. So do you think that means he really does think so?

20090128191920AAIjKsG	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What should you do if...?	I was doing a group project for my school. Since all of us have multiple APs and things to do, the only way to contact each other after school would be either phone or online   There was a person in our group   I called her one day, she agreed to meet me at facebook. I waited and waited and she never came, so I got offline since I have other homeworks to do   Next day, it turns out that she was online and trying to find me, only an hour later than the phone call   Then there are times, when I sent her message through her cell phone after finding out she is not online and turned her phone, when she did not answer me. Yes, she saw it, as confirmed next day, just did not respond   And then there was one day, after I sent my part of the project to her to ask for advice, I waited and waited online for answer. I never gotten any until next day   Turns out she fell asleep   I am not a really demanding person, I know that sometimes it takes her time to do stuff, all I want from her is that she responds me, let me know that she heard what I said and is doing it; and sometimes tell me exactly what she is doing. Like tell me that she will be online an hour later instead telling me that she "will be" online, and tell me that she is going to sleep instead making me wait for a long time expecting her to give me an answer. It is very frustrating to waste time constantly waiting her like that, especially when I desperately need time to do other things.    I then sent her a message telling her that it is better for her to respond me when I contact her instead ignoring it, because I have other things to do and cannot wait for her forever. Then she started talking about me giving her a lecture of responsibility and that I think she did not work hard on the project, and that I am harassing her with the idea of not being responsible   So... what should you do if you are in my situation? How should I say it right so she will respond me next time when I need to contact her?

Finally when I finish my chores, I hang out with my friends, we like to go the the beach. We bring lots of sunscreen to protect our skin from burning. My mom makes food and we put it in the cooler. I like looking at shells and playing in the sand. Unfortunatly when it is cold outside we cant go to the beach, so we watch movies and play games.         thanks :)

20090128184659AAXVdjf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I feel living with homophobic family members is just like living with strangers.Am I normal to feel that way?	Maybe you have read my question before, if you really do, just ignore my question. If you haven't, I appreciate if you spend 2-3minutes reading my question    My parents and sister hate me because I am gay. What should I do?  I am 23, male. I am a full-time history student at a Hong Kong university. I am also a part-time clerk in the history museum. I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.    Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, I wanna lock all gay men up.Put all gay men to concentration camp, You are such a loser, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) Everytime they say such things , I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for 6 months!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?  " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say I am straight anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about yourself therefore it is imposible for you to get help from counsellor. "    Question 1) I decided to turn my study into part-time, also turn my job to full-time so I can move out. Do you mentally support me?    Quetion 2) How do you think of my sister and my parents?    Question 3) How to raise my own self-esteem now? It seems no one like me.    Question 4) The same as my title question      Question 4) IS IT OK FOR ME TO CLOSE MY ROOM DOOR WHEN I AM CRYING? AM I GUILTY OF CLOSING MY ROOM'S DOOR?

20090128191705AA9N34Q	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Men do you expect darker skin black women to be unattractive? ?	I hear the statement "she's pretty for a black girl or for a dark skin girl" a lot and sometimes coming from other black people. So it is that most darker skin women you see are unattractive, overweight, bad attitude what is it?   I'm listening to SargeWP (yes I listen to him don't get all angry lol) but in this video he was saying it's because of the weight. That he sees more overweight dark skin black women who don't wear make-up and don't try to be feminine and attractive then lighter skin black women. MEN do find this to be true or false?

20090128190507AAusXh9	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is this good or bad for the LGBT community?	I saw an episode of Law and Order tonight where a character was able to find a genetic marker for homosexuality.      While the episode itself ended with the presumed death of the fetus in question do to other plot elements and because of that gene, it does put recent scientific evidence out to the public.      I'll grant that from the 1/2 of the episode that I saw that there wasn't a lot of information given but we all know that TV is responsible for a great many changes both technologically and socially.       So the question is this: Does putting this information in the plot for what is arguably one of the most viewed dramas on TV help or hurt the LGBT fight for recognition?      Please don't be offensive in your answers. I don't care about Religious ramifications of homosexuality in this question, only the sociopolitical ramifications, if any.

20090128185948AA1CynY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think it's kind of irresponsible to have children?	I want to start out by saying that I'm not condemning anyone who's pregnant or who already has children. I know everyone means well and I hope the best for your families. With that said, here are my thoughts lately:      I know a lot of people have really strong faith in God (I'll use Christianity for example), so they assume they know that the afterlife will be ok for them. However, Jesus says that the way is narrow and most people are going to hell. In other words, statistically, you'd be more likely to be raising kindling wood for hell. I know that sounds awful, but seriously, why chance it? Why not just adopt a kid who already exists?      And what if Christianity's not even true and everyone ends up going to some horrible afterlife. Why create more people when none of us truly knows that comes after this? Even if you think you're saved, Jesus talks about how people will come up to Him and say "Lord, Lord" thinking they had been saved when they weren't.      In other words, isn't it a little irresponsible to reproduce when you have no solid basis for what lies ahead, and when most religions specifically state that most people will be tormented for eternity?      Thanks for your understanding.

Bear in mind, by the death of Jesus, more lives have been lost in His name, including by Hitler (than Hitler alone), and Jesus' death made it possible to save the souls rather than lives of all after, the victims and the killers including Hitler.  And to travel in time to kill Jesus so you can be forgiven for killing seems a little crazy.        I don't like Catch 22's...they make my head hurt.

I am a very relaxed, you know no worries kind of person with almost everything in life.  For example, I got fired on Monday and I really cried when it first happened but by the end of the day I was able to smile and brush it off and start looking for other opportunities.  Or when our car got towed for no apparent reason, I was mad for like a minute but then I got over it.  That makes it easier to bounce back from bad things that happen but I sometimes feel that maybe by not getting worked up by anything for more than a few hours that I am just passing through life.

20090128185446AA20fYF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Author or creator of ravers manifesto?	who is the original creator or author of the raver's manifesto?:   Our emotional state of choice is Ecstasy. Our nourishment of choice is Love. Our addiction of choice is technology. Our religion of choice is music. Our currency of choice is knowledge. Our politics of choice is none. Our society of choice is utopian though we know it will never be.      You may hate us. You may dismiss us. You may misunderstand us. You may be unaware of our existence. We can only hope you do not care to judge us, because we would never judge you. We are not criminals. We are not disillusioned. We are not drug addicts. We are not naive children. We are one massive, global, tribal village that transcends man-made law, physical geography, and time itself. We are The Massive. One Massive.      We were first drawn by the sound. From far away, the thunderous, muffled, echoing beat was comparable to a mother's heart soothing a child in her womb of concrete, steel, and electrical wiring. We were drawn back into this womb, and there, in the heat, dampness, and darkness of it, we came to accept that we are all equal. Not only to the darkness, and to ourselves, but to the very music slamming into us and passing through our souls: we are all equal. And somewhere around 35Hz we could feel the hand of God at our backs, pushing us forward, pushing us to push ourselves to strengthen our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Pushing us to turn to the person beside us to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy we felt from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening, protect us from the horrors, atrocities, and pollution of the outside world. It is in that very instant, with these initial realizations that each of us was truly born.      We continue to pack our bodies into clubs, or warehouses, or buildings you've abandoned and left for naught, and we bring life to them for one night. Strong, throbbing, vibrant life in it's purest, most intense, most hedonistic form. In these makeshift spaces, we seek to shed ourselves of the burden of uncertainty for a future you have been unable to stabilize and secure for us. We seek to relinquish our inhibitions, and free ourselves from the shackles and restraints you've put on us for your own peace of mind. We seek to re-write the programming that you have tried to indoctrinate us with since the moment we were born. Programming that tells us to hate, that tells us to judge, that tells us to stuff ourselves into the nearest and most convenient pigeon hole possible. Programming that even tells us to climb ladders for you, jump through hoops, and run through mazes and on hamster wheels. Programming that tells us to eat from the shiny silver spoon you are trying to feed us with, instead of nourish ourselves with our own capable hands. Programming that tells us to close our minds, instead of open them.      Until the sun rises to burn our eyes by revealing the distopian reality of a world you've created for us, we dance fiercely with our brothers and sisters in celebration of our life, of our culture, and of the values we believe in: Peace, Love, Freedom, Tolerance, Unity, Harmony, Expression, Responsibility and Respect.      Our enemy of choice is ignorance. Our weapon of choice is information. Our crime of choice is breaking and challenging whatever laws you feel you need to put in place to stop us from celebrating our existence. But know that while you may shut down any given party, on any given night, in any given city, in any given country or continent on this beautiful planet, you can never shut down the entire party. You don't have access to that switch, no matter what you may think. The music will never stop. The heartbeat will never fade. The party will never end.      I am a raver, and this is my manifesto.
20090128192831AA0vg4W	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Selling your virginity: shouldn't it be illegal?	What are your thoughts on this?   Isn't it prostitution - therefore illegal?   Would you ever do it?   Before you ask, NO I would never think of doing something stupid like that, I just want to hear others views.      Natalie Dylan, the 22-year-old girl auctioning off her virginity, will potentially rake in $3.8 million for the sale of her innocence. Scandalist spoke with Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Nevada, who is facilitating the auction. Dennis reported that so far the auction is going very, very well.      “We have offers from $1 million to $3.8 million, and we have started collecting deposits,” Dennis exclusively tells Scandalist. But the highest bidder won’t necessarily win Natalie’s heart, and virginity. As Natalie told Scandalist, she won’t do the deed with just anyone, but hopes to find someone who “seems intelligent.” Although her personal top pick, Barack Obama, has not placed a bid, Natalie has some excellent potential first-time partners.

20090128183426AAtsDge	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do I tell my friend I love her, in a non homosexual way? ?	DISCLAIMER: I have NOTHING against gays/lesbians/bisexuals. I am straight. And I just love this girl.       Okay, so there is this girl, Anya, who is my best friend. She's 18 and I'm 15. My school is really small, and she is seriously my best friend. her family was in a terrible car accident, and I was diagnosed with Epilepsy in Sept. 2007. Because of that, she and I relate so well. I know that probably doesn't make sense how we relate that way, but we do.    I can talk to her about anything, and I just love her so much. I mean, I am NOT IN LOVE with her. But I love her so much. But like more than a sister.    School gets out at 3:45, and at like 8:00, I'll be missing her! Like, I could spend the rest of my life together, and she even said that when I get into med school, she thinks we should live together.    Like, if I had to pick on person to be with in my life, it wouldn't even be my boyfriend. It's be her! It almost hurts me how much I love her. If that makes sense. Like, I always want to be with her.       Like, how do I make it clear to her that I love her so much? And to make sure it doesn't sound like homosexual love?

20090128184521AARP6It	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For athiests and god believers...?	Lets say there was a medical miracle that can bring people back from the dead it only works on people if they've been dead for about an hour. It doesn't work on anyone, only on who gets lucky to come back to life. Lets say 1 million dying people were tested and only 500 thousand of them were brought back to life 1 hour after they were pronounced dead.      For god believers- Lets say all those 500 thousand people say for the hour that they've been dead they've all experienced the same thing, there is no god, no afterlife, no heaven, no hell. They all say there is nothing. Would EVERY god believer in the world now drop belief in all religions? would religious wars be over? would there be no god believers anymore? Would everyone be an athiest?      For athiests? lets say those 100 thousand people all say they all met god and they all described him to look the same. They all described seeing "a light". Would every athiest in the world now know that there is a heaven and hell and a god exists and would everyone in the world now know that religion is important? would the world become even more religious then ever before?

20090128183222AAlCQ40	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To whom it may concern ?	Despite my Piscean nature and almost addiction to love, I know that It can only bring pain. The truth may hurt but that's it there it is. Love being just a chemical reaction can and will dull over time. Love is inevitably going fail. Ether you will stop producing the right amounts or you will become tolerant to them like any other drug. I feel I must clarify my reasons, I find many people that have spoken these same words for many different reasons. I haven't really been hurt much, the truth is I just think that is how it is. I do "love" a few select friends, but that magic connection just can not be maintained for a physical relationship. I am a dreamer and have a deep even painful longing for love and commitment. But the world just has too many people and not enough love for all of them. I'm leaving this place that has been my prison and for it to be complete I must throw off my childish notions of love, honor, heroes, and fairy tales.           to whom it may concern,   I metaphorically commit my body and life to the ages, and brake your worldly bonds. tho I shall live physically no that it will not be a life of a childish dreamer. Nor that of a gullible young man, No from this day forth I shall be a realist. The world is a cruel place, so to survive I shall be a cruel man

Why wouldn't they have been on their best behavior, instead of attacking that one church, or that little old lady?

20090128185533AA5FAM1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How can i confront my teacher?	i hate my chemistry teacher. im a sophomore (16) and only 4'8", no im not a midget. but im the shortest kid in my class and she seems to always pick on me. She acts like she's not trying to be mean about it but i feel like she only wants to embarrass me in class by using me as examples. like today she got the tallest guy and girl come up in front with the shortest guy and girl. she asked us to stand next to each other so when the shortest girl stood by me she was taller than me and my teacher kinda smirked and almost whispered that even our shortest girl is taller than me making the whole class laugh. She ended up making us do some dumb presentation on how energy and wavelengths flow by using the tops of our heads as the peak. Which technically doesnt make sense cause its now how tall or short the wave is but how long/short horizontally so i think she just wanted to humiliate me. Ive been dealing with this kinda stuff all year and want it to stop, so how? Should i try to arrange a meeting with her? oh and her procedure of how we line up to leave the room is tallest to shortest so im always last. i just think she dislikes me cause im short and shes kinda tall maybe 5'9" and maybe she had a bad incident with a short person. all i know is she is discriminating me and i think she could actually be fired, right? suggestions.

Hi (this is a previous post that was deleted- not sure why??- so I couldn't read all the comments) I'm an athiest who started a Christian organization at my family's church.

Camel Snus is a new tobacco product that can be enjoyed indors or anywhere. Its in a little pouch that you put in your mouth. No spitting involved until you are finished with it. I think the idea of it is so that you don't have to go out in the cold to smoke. Smokers will now be able to tolerate long flights, hospital stays/visits, movie theatres, and other smoke free environments without going nuts because they can't have a cigarette.

Recently (3 weeks) I've been having casual encounters with someone I've known for a while.  As I've been spending more time with her I've discovered that we have more in common than I knew and I'm totally open to taking it to the next step, though I don't want to rush things.  I'm having trouble reading how she feels about it though.  But anyways, I want to hangout with her more one-on-one and in group settings.  However, we have A LOT of mutual friends in the LGBTQIA community and I'm unsure about their reactions and any weirdness that might happen if they know our history.      Summary:   1. Do I even ask her about hanging out in a group setting more often or is that pushing things?   2. Does a group setting where we can both feel like we know people and interact have to involve our mutual friends?   3. Do I ask her about what we'll tell our friends or how we'll act around them?

I put everything off so this is hard for me. I think it is because of anxiety. Then there is the drama I get myself in by trying to make friendships with people that don't want one with me. I have this really bad and it's starting to consume my life. I feel worthless unless I make these relationships work. I tell myself if I can overcome this than I can overcome other things. Yeah...crazy, I know. I am starting to think these people know this and are getting a kick out of ignoring and rejecting me.

20090128202832AAGNqYS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, why do I need to be saved?	I've been told that I need to be saved because I was born with 'Original Sin'.  This is because Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit so therefore, all mankind was punished forever for this original sin.  So, if I understand this correctly, I need to be saved from eternal punishment because one of my ancestors committed a crime?  Is it fair that I should pay (forever) for what someone else did of which I could not have prevented even if I had wanted to?  Then one might say, "Life isn't fair."  But does not God have the power to make it fair?  Another argument might be that God is doing all this to teach us a lesson.  But if I was not the one who committed the original sin, why would I need to be taught a lesson?

20090128200148AA9IlUQ	Society & Culture;Etiquette	HELP! I have a problem.....?	I am an immigrant who came from China, the really conservative kind. I will not bug others to follow my rules, unless, maybe, to a healthy extend, let my girlfriend follow some. Exclude that, I keep all rules to myself.   So, here is the problem  I really hate it when people bug me by asking me which girl I like, do i like certain girl, and tease me suggesting that some girl and i have an relationship [which is not true]. This maybe fine in American culture, but in mine, I am offended because I want complete privacy on who I like. It gets worse when someone suggest that a girl and I "make out", or looks like a fine couple, or some girl pretend they like me by doing the kissing expression to me. This bothers me so much, like when it bothers you when someone said the n word. So, what should I say to them if they are teasing me about this?  And, if someone asks me if I like a girl and I answered that she is not my type, does that offend the girl? If so, how should I say it?

I would really really appreciate if someone out there would help me. Please help a fellow psychic (if you are a psychic). well thanks in advance   love,   C

20090128200936AA0lCvn	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What do you think about this story? Ramadan?	So this is the story, and PLEASE correct me if i am wrong.      So there was a man (not sure if he was a sahaba, companion of the prophet) but he was walking down a river. And as he was walking down, he saw an apple floating down teh river towards him. He picks up the apple and eats it. So when he has eaten the apple, he continues walking down the river to find an Apple tree farm owned by a man. So the person who ate the apple goes up to the man and says, "I ate your apple, I am sorry, How can i repay you?"       than the owner of the farm says "You have to work for me for a certain amount of time (not sure what:)" So the man who ate teh apple is extremely guilty for his actions and agrees to work for the man on his farm.      So as time passes the owner of the farm sees that this person is actually very noble, humble, well-mannered, respectuful, loyal, kind, with integreity and many other good qualities. So because the man who ate the apple said that he would agree to all the commands of the farm owner, one day the farm owner comes up to the companion and asks him to marry his daughter. So because the companion promised that he would do anything and everythign, he agrrees to his request, but is warned that the farm owner's daughter is blind, deaf, and mute. Even after hearing all this, the companion continues  with his decision.      After the marriage when he first sees the daughter he is in extreme shock because the woman who stands before him, is one of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Than the father explains that his daughter is "blind" because she has never laid eyes on anythign that was haram or bad (or was it that no man had laid eyes on her? not sure about this part) that she was "deaf" becaues she had never heard any bad thing and "mute" because she had never spoken anything of evil.      And they lived happily ever after.   <3      What do you think of it?

When he's there he's all smiley and twinky and fun and tries on a million and one things while I'm working in the fitting rooms.      Anyway, he's been doing this for a while now, and every time I see him I want to die inside because he's so totally adorable.      So today, ok, I know, I know I should have...  but I totally checked out his name on his credit card and Facebook stalked him when I got home.        We don't have any friends in common though, leading me to believe that he might not actually be gay because I live in a small city where EVERY gay guy seems to have like at least 20 friends in common when they add you.      I really want to make a move, but am afraid of coming off as rude or creepy... or offending him if I got his sexuality wrong.        What should I do?????

20090128202002AAOcmfg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Evidence of Evolution Working in Action Today?	I've taken the first 2 paragraphs of the article but if you have the time read the whole thing, very interesting.      From www.richarddawkins.net on this page- http://www.richarddawkins.net/article,35...       Reposted from:     http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...        "ScienceDaily (Jan. 24, 2009) — Penn State Assistant Professor of Biology Tracy Langkilde has shown that native fence lizards in the southeastern United States are adapting to potentially fatal invasive fire-ant attacks by developing behaviors that enable them to escape from the ants, as well as by developing longer hind legs, which can increase the effectiveness of this behavior.       "Not only does this finding provide biologists with an example of evolution in action, but it also provides wildlife managers with knowledge that they can use to develop plans for managing invasive species," said Langkilde. The results will be described in a paper to be published later this month in the journal Ecology.       I think it's brilliant we have more evidence for evoultion. Evidence we can see and test in our own lifetimes that theists can't cast any doubt upon.      What do you think?

20090128194739AAUBrHy	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My manager made a mistake didn't she? ?	I do not work in an office.  I am a home visit nurse that does not need to report to the office personally except via telephone or computer. On occasion I do make quick in and out of the office to drop off documents or pick up supplies. I make it a point to park in our 15 minute zone so this alone makes it clear days can go by before I even make an appearance in our office.  I purposefully do NOT spend any extra time there as our nursing staff has the tendency to park themselves there for hours for idol gossip. It's an issue with our managers and frankly I don't want to be seen as a problem employee!       Ok saying that yesterday while I was out seeing my first appointment I got 2 voicemails from my office telling me that I had my "student" nurse was still at the office waiting for me to pick them up!  Unfortunately, where I was there is NO cell reception as everyone knows this.  I got my messages a couple of hours later.  I will say this.  I had not notification of this being assigned to me. My manager does not want us to be in the office or start there in the am... so the only way I recieve communication is via email or phone calls.         I spoke to my manager today about this as I felt bad there was student nurse waiting for hours before she was able to leave the office and join someone in the field.        My manager told me that the "schedule board" at the office showed that I had a student with me and I should of checked it.  I told her, I do not go into the office unless I am dropping off docuements, or supplies.  This board is located in someone's private cubicle.  I told her I am sorry things worked out this way, but in the future an email or phone call must be done to me as I just don't spend time in the office as my work is out in the feild and she discourages employees coming in!        Am I correct?

20090128193817AAhqGif	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Homosexual masculinity?	Okay before I ask this, I just want everyone to know that I am a staunch supporter of homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, heterosexuality, ANY kind of sexuality.       Now, for all my gays out there! Anyone who calls themselves a gay man is absolutely a man. I mean, no matter whether you like men or women, BIOLOGICALLY you are a man. This doesn't apply to transexuals of course. So, being gay MEN are you proud of your masculinity as well as your sexual preference? I mean...just because you are a homosexual doesn't mean you're not a man. i thought of this question when I saw a facebook event called "national man day" and the rules of the event was just "be a man. Watch football, drink beer with your friends, blow things up, manly stuff like that." I don't know if I really expressed myself exactly the way I like in this question but I think you get my point. I understand it won't be the same for everyone who answers this question. So, opinions?

Please translate into Spanish without the help of online translators (I can do that myself)   Thank you      Data Analysis   Pressure and volume waveforms in the time domain for each individual were ensemble-averaged (with periodicity normalized to 1 second by scaling the time axis). ITF relating Prad to the DVP waveform and relating the Pdig waveform to the DVP waveform in the frequency domain were determined from fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of waveforms for each individual: ITF(Prad/DVP)=FFT(Prad)/FFT(DVP) and ITF(Pdig/DVP)=FFT(Pdig)/FFT(DVP).    The first 10 harmonics of each waveform were used for this analysis because higher harmonics do not contribute significantly. ITFs were determined at baseline and 3 minutes after NTG administration (when changes due to NTG were maximal) by use of a minimum of 6 consecutive stable cycles obtained from all 3 transducers.

Pressure and Volume Pulse Recording   Photoplethysmographic digital volume was determined by use of an infrared light–emitting diode (940 nm) and phototransistor (Micro Medical) applied to either side of the index finger of the right hand. Applanation tonometry was used to record Prad by use of a piezo-resistive cantilever transducer (Millar SPT 301, Millar Instruments) applied over the radial artery of the left arm. Pdig was measured noninvasively by use of a servocontrolled pressure cuff device (Finapres 2300, Ohmeda) applied to the middle finger of the right hand. Previous studies have shown that changes in pressure recorded by the tonometer and Finapres accurately reflect changes in intra-arterial blood pressure. Signals from all transducers were amplified, displayed in real time, digitized, and recorded via a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (sampling frequency 100 Hz). Further digital signal processing was performed offline. Brachial artery pressure (left arm) was measured by use of an automated oscillometric method (Dinamap, Critikon). Because the purpose of the present study was to compare the shape of the waveforms, all waveforms were normalized to the same amplitude (nominally equal to brachial artery pulse pressure).

Majic Jack Dangerous Puts Spyware On Computer - The Hidden Truth Behind Majic JackPosted Jan-28-09 19:17:31 PSTreal problems with magic jack .... is majic jack hiding something?       read the tos ("terms of service) for magic jack very closely. you might be surprised at what you see there. or not see there. i've pointed out issues with magic jack in earler articles on broadband nation (see archives). but this revelation should make you very concerned.      in short ... to quote a favorite cartoon character .... "be afwaid, very afwaid".      this is just pointing out the not-so-obvious that is hidden deep within the tos, and other 'gotcha's' that you won't realize until after you give up your $ and privacy!      first:      here is the contact info for magicjack:      po box 6785   west palm beach, fl 33405      magic jack phone number: 281-404-1551   billing magicjack number: 561-594-2140      caution: it looks like they track the number that calls and places you into a repeating loop if you call back a second time. so if you need to call a second time make sure its from a different number.      second:      in the tos you agree that everything in your computer is fair game for them to know about, all web sites, email, and numbers called are there info.      you agree to have all of your information resold to third parties.      there is no un install for this program. even if you stop using it, it gathers your information.      you are put under high pressure to sign up and pay for 5 years.      there is no published phone number, email address, or mailing address.      all customer support is done via type in the box chat.      there is no written warranty on the box. it breaks, you buy another to maintain your service.      computer must be left on to make or receive calls.      pop up window comes to front of screen anytime there is a call in or out call.      majicjack spyware slows down your computer even when you are not using magicjack      advertising is in the pop up box.      and yes, you do save around $150 a year not using a real voip company.      at what little price people put on the information and security.      so ask yourself, is it really worth it?      wait .... there's more.      majic jack is owned and run by ymax. they are not a stand alone voip provider.       also .....       "the software for the magicjack does not run directly from the device. it fully installs on the windows system, which also makes the magicjack less attractive for situations where one might want to use it on someone else's computer (say when visiting family). making this even worse, there was no easy way to uninstall the software from the system, with the program not even showing up in the windows remove program window. update: magicjack confirmed that there is currently no easy way to uninstall the software. the process required to uninstall the software requires multiple windows registry edits and the removal of several folders on the windows system. based on this, i wouldn't recommend using the magicjack on the systems of friends, family or business associates." -- (see magicjack fails to cast a voip spell)       nobody should accept having to leave unwanted software on a personal computer, or any tell-tale trace of the mj program on a public computer, a business workstation, or a borrowed device.      the key concepts here are action and intent. if mj is not actively monitoring computer activity and collecting data about its customers, that's great. they would be taking no action that anyone could be concerned about.      but consider their intent. their tos spell out their intent -- the intent to feed context sensitive advertising, which requires manipulation of information from your brain through their software into their processors. there seems to be little restriction of what info their software can see. (kind of like your home builder installing bugging devices and cameras into your bedroom, just not yet watching the feed.) then there is the ability of mj to modify their software (upgrape, anyone?) at any time, without the common user's ability to stop it, and that revision could include the spyware coding. while you, the uncommon user, have the ability to see what they are doing, the common user has no idea when the change is made. now let's consider mj's intent of not building in an uninstall capability. i am suggesting that this exposes mj's intent to have their software on your pc whether you're an active phone customer or not. what would be the intent of having that software on the pc of a former customer? (consider, also, their "convenience" feature of taking the device with you so you can use it on a friend's pc -- thus installing the software on that machine, too!) what information could that software obtain that would be of value to mj? and what could the common user do to stop it?      mj could shut down their phone service tomorrow, and they have a window into 1 million pcs -- to feed advertising, log key strokes, and obtain surfing patterns.      by l

20090128203604AAeJ5gA	Society & Culture;Languages	Do you understand this?	In the extraordinarily grand scheme of things, do words actually mean anything?      I’m starting to believe that the answer is, in fact, No.   Think, incredibly hard, the words themselves, had they been their own,inanimate beings. Would they mean anything at all? Towards humans, physical beings?   If someone tells you “You’re stupid.” How does that make you feel?      Hurt? Annoyed? Upset?      Why?   They are inanimate objects, non existent, inanimate objects. Again, compared to you, the human PHYSICAL being, why would two NON-PHYSICAL beings bother you at all?   They are WORDS, literally meaning NOTHING; for they are simple grunts and moans that we comprehend as a language. It is beyond me why we are affected by these grunts and moans in such a PHYSICAL way, seeing as they are NON-PHYSICAL.      And why, why in the world do people bother to do much of anything that they shouldn’t be bothered to do?   The end result of LIFE, is DEATH. No matter what you think. So I do not understand why people bother fighting their opinions. Now, before you start to assume things, hear me out for a sec: I’m not saying stay in your room and wait to die, in fact that is the complete opposite of what I’m trying to say here.What I’m saying is don’t bother with things that absolutely do not matter in the long-run. If you don’t like what someone is wearing, yet they do, why would you (in this case, literally) waste your breath by telling them you think it’s ugly. Trust me, that will not hang over their heads for the rest of their life,and if it does, they obviously have not thought of words being the NON-PHYSICAL beings that they are. Do not bother with people who waste your precious time by telling you they don’t think you’re as smart as them. They went to [a better] college; they graduated from high school; you hadn’t. Therefore, you’re not as intelligent. What right do they have to say something like that? In mine and many people’s opinion, school does not equal education. School can either teach you everything, or nothing, it all depends on the kind of person you are.
