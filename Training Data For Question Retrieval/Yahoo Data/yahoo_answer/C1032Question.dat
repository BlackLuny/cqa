20090307165539AAgPmng	Sports;Winter Sports;Snowboarding	Heli-dropping in Alaska?	Ive been snowboarding for my entire life and just regular mountains, while they are still fun, are seeming to get a little redundant.  I was doing some research and i heard that the ultimate place to snowboard is to get a helicopter and drop on a mountain especially in Alaska.      So my question is   how do i come across doing this?   are there any programs that will do group drops to avoid spending as much?   What should i expect while snowboarding? (terrain, hiking, ect.)   Will my Burton Hero suffice?   How light will my wallet be at the end of the trip?   I've heard that it is really dangerous, but honestly, how dangerous is it?   I'm looking for a challenge and an experience like none other.   HELP ME OUT

I've been playing for about 6 years now and recently I have become very quick on my feet in tennis. About a year ago, I was overweight and lazy so I never ran, but then I started to run on my treadmill and now I run in tennis all the time. The first real hardcore tennis I have played would be my tryout to my high school tennis team. I feel a whole lot better now that I run alot and hit some nice ground strokes with my Babolat, but now a new problem has arisen. Blisters all over my feet. How do I deal with them? Almost every day after tennis practice my feet have em. The first time I saw them, I just took a nail clipper and clipped off the weird skin. the next day, there is a new blister right where the old skin was clipped off! The blisters are mainly on the inner facing side of my big toes. How do I deal with them?

20090307180224AAeNWIQ	Sports;Wrestling	How Does Wrestling Affect YOUR Personal "Style"?	This is Basically a Combination of My Past 2 Questions (Wrestling Affecting Personality , & Affecting Culture) , Along with a New Twist.      This Time , I Want to Know , Does Wrestling Affect Who You Are as an Individual & The Choices You Make as it Pertains to Music , Clothes , Attitude , Movies , How You Treat Others , Etc...         Example (for Me) :      Music - I've Always Like Rock Music , but with the vastly Increasing Amount of Themes (PPV & for Superstars) Produced for WWE by Rock Groups like Saliva , Rev Theory , Alter Bridge , etc... It's Brought Me New Groups to Listen to As Well. I Thank WWE for Jet Black Stare , EndeverafteR , & Especially Rev Theory. I've Also Introduced to a Different Sound , that Upbeat Rap like MVP's Theme by Silkk the Shocker , & RR's Theme "Let it Rock" by Kevin Rudolf. My Preference has been Widely Expanded.      Clothes - My 2 Favorite Superstars are John Cena & Edge. My Style has been Adopted to reflect both of Their's to fit Me. I have the Original & New Reebok Pumps and Under Armours , but I Also Have Affliction T-Shirts. It's a Compilation of Edge's Rockstar look w/ Cena's Rap look.      Attitude/Treating Others - Wrestling has been a Great Proving Ground as it were to Understand Respect is Earned , Not Given. Credit goes to Undisputed Jericho Y2J for this Quote "RAW = Respect All Wrestlers". It Fits in Everyday life as Well. I Respect Everyone , So Long as There is Mutual Respect Shared.   As for Personality - as a Fan , You Almost become the Same way as Your Favorite Performer. my Personality has Become Tenfold more Outgoing & Spontaneous in the Last Year.         I just Want Your Thoughts on this.   Thanks...

20090307180826AA7Yx8e	Sports;Running	Breathing while running?	Lately we've been running 3 miles every monday, wednesday, and friday, and it's really not that hard to me.  I've learned how to control my breathing on them so its like a steady breath (because we're really not going at a fast pace).  Well on Wednesday, we had to run a mile and i ran mine in 6:36 (fastest i have ever ran a mile lol).  Well when i was running it, I kept my breathing at pretty much the same slow pace i usually do (although it was faster on the last lap). So my question is, on the one mile runs should I like breathe really fast like some people?  To the point to where they're like panting while running, or does keeping that same steady breath do better?  I'm not sure if I'm getting enough oxygen to my legs when I do this is what I'm wondering.  I can't really explain the feeling on the last lap because i kind of forgot it lol, but it was like my breathing wasn't keeping up with my legs? lol

20090307183750AAmQSGl	Sports;Hockey	Issues discussed on the hotstove?	The NHL tiebreaker should be wins in regulation, not just wins.......Ken Holland's idea I believe. Makes sense to me! You?       One of the sticking points for no shows at the all star game and the subsequent suspensions was an argument of competitive balance......for example, Lidstrom and Datsyuk were suspended for 1 game, it was vs. the Columbus Bluejackets (who won) and alot of people felt that it wasn't fair that Columbus got that advantage (I find the whole notion a little silly because how is it different than any other suspension aside from the fact that the team that the infraction was against probably does not get the advantage) but the point brought up was players who sat out on the eve of the trade deadline......many players were a healthy scratch (Antropov-Moore-Recchi) because they were going to be traded and it upsets the competitive balance and they should have to play. Seems a little nitpicky to me! How about you?

Who is the greatest "cancer" (By this I mean combo of talent but a real cancer like TO) in NHL History      6) Is it good or bad when your teams biggest signing in the last 15yrs is Doug Gilmour      7) Is hell freezing over

20090227092347AAP5TU8	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	How are Villa going to cope with the Champions League if they cant even compete in the uefa cup and the league?	Ok i can understand why spurs rested players, however it still bemuses me as to why villa rested players, after all if they are going to qualify for the champions league next season then european experience in the uefa cup would have been very good for their team.  O'Neill stated that the reason why he played a reserve team in the uefa cup this week was to rest his key players for the league and hopefully qualify for the champions league, but surely if villa were to qualify for the CL next season then they would still be faced with the same problem between league and european commitments.  The Champions League is a much tougher beast than the uefa cup and if Villa's squad cannot cope with interlinking league and european commitments at a basic level then surely they are going to suffer even worse if they were to qualify for the CL.  So therefore it begs the question whats the point in villa qualifying for the CL other than the financial incentives if they have had to rest players all ready this season and that's just for the uefa cup...

WTF      Did David Stern not receive Dick Barvetta's phone call today? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FfLbd_Zi...       Great game, maybe the win of the year. The Heat are losing, meaning we gain a game on them. the local Southsouth station didn't pick up the game, so I had to watch the game on the internet, which means talking mean trash to Piston fans. Instead, they had on some irrelevant Pac-10 basketball game. Anyway, BIG win, and I can't wait till the Nuggets come Monday.      LETS GO HAWKS!!!
20090227094603AAtL7Vu	Sports;Wrestling	Why do wrestling fans associate drugs with some wrestlers but not others?	The reason I ask this is because a user on here was asking a question about Jeff Hardy and Edge, and one person said that Edge didn't need drugs to succeed. But, Edge has been suspended for drugs in the past.    So my question is, why do people say things like that? Whenever a question is asked about Jeff Hardy, at least one answer will pertain to drugs. But people seem to forget that Edge, Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Bret Hart, Mr. Kennedy and a whole bunch of other guys have either tested positive or admitted to using them.   So what's the difference? Why does Jeff Hardy get such a bad rap when Edge and Randy Orton get off easy?

20090227094724AACQ3ZC	Sports;Wrestling	Front Row Seats to WWE Raw in Atlanta, GA (April 13th)?	I'm very upset, as I was on the ticketmaster site this morning for the presale and tried to get 3 front row seat tickets, and they were unavailable by 10:02 AM, and I refuse to sit so far away from the ring. I hate this tremendously, as my little nephew was looking forward to landing those seats big time.       I called Ticketmaster to see if some better seats will be available tomorrow when it goes on sale to the general public but the guy didn't give me an answer that I liked.       I don't understand the purpose of the presale, if the public can't compete for floor seating when it really goes on sale tomorrow.      With all of that said, I'm now asking the Answers community if they know how to land 3 front row seats to the Atlanta Raw taping for April 13th, because I'm still determined to get them. I'm still going to see if any are available tomorrow when the tickets actually go on sale to the general public but I doubt if any more will be available.      If not front row, then I can deal with other floor seats just fine. I'm just a little ticked off since I really had my heart set on landed front row or floor seating for the event.

BUT THEN THE FOLLOWING SEASON HE THREW 49 TD'S lol! I like Al but this seems too much. He is guaranteed 41 mil no matter what and he has had injury problems. In this economic climate, i don't even know how players can get paid like this. I hope Al works out but If AL DOESN'T PRODUCE, i will not be happy with his ***.

Now I know the story as far as, Gerald Henderson was making a desperate attempt to smack the ball away and he was full force in hitting Tyler in the face. Whether you think it was an accident or a cheap shot doesn't matter. But I was wondering if he actually "broke" it. I was watching one clip where the commentator said " it bled alot but not enough to be broken." or something along those lines. Which led me to believe it was not broken. So basically bloody and bruised, or actual full on break. I know he had to wear some sort of protective mask though as well.     I would like 100% honest answers and if at all possible a credible source for the replies.    Thank you.

20090307184005AAf4zf3	Sports;Wrestling	Here are my ideas for smackdown vs raw 2010?	First I think that some people’s overalls should be boosted.    Jeff Hardy Overall 90    Big Show Overall 91 or 92    Rey mysterio- 87 or 88       While some peoples overall should be lowered    Matt Hardy- 84 or 85    Chavo Guerrero-82 or 83    Mr Kennedy- 85       Another problem is that some people should have DIFFERENT attires such as    Edge in camo or in red    Jeff hardy in face paint    Undertaker ABA    Batista in white or red    Kane with mask   Something else is the create a character DESGINS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO ONLINE!!!       As in game modes GM mode back and more main eventers in RTWM such as    Edge    Jeff hardy matt hardy co-op    Batista and rey co-op    Randy Orton    John Cena    Shawn Michaels triple h co-op     Chris Jericho          Lastly matches and legends we need new people not hulk Hogan and Bret hart. We need       Owen hart    Eddie Guerrero    British bulldog    Ultimate warrior,   The Von Ehrics     LOD      Mainly diva legends such as the    Fabulous moolah (Manager)    Trish stratus    Mae young (Manager)    Sensational Sherri (Manager)   Lita      Matches- I think they should bring back    The casket match and get rid of    the gaulnet match.       In the backstage brawl they need more spots and maybe even travel around them.       They should also add the    I quit match and    Readd special referee.       Finally, created stuff and online       CAS- more items and more layers. Also said above DESIGNS should be playable online       Movesets- in 09 they removed many older moves especially Chris Benoits.       Entrances I can’t come up with anything       But the big one CAF should be shortened to 5 instead of 10 due no glitching online. Also they should be from anywhere just not groggy front and       Finally online im praying they remove the R1 Triangle Square glitch. They should make it that you can mute others mics and kick anyone no matter if there in out of the match character choosing.

20090307184710AAsE0dI	Sports;Football (American)	Should the Titans sign Aaron Moorehead?	They need Recievers. He has 31 catches for 330 yards and 1 td in 36 career games.      That's more than Percy Harvin, Hakeem Nicks, Brian Robskie, Kenny Britt, Jeremy Maclin, Michael Crabtree, and Darius Heyward-Bey all combined.      One guy has 31 more receptions then 7 of the "top" prospects coming in the NFL next year. So i'd say it'd be a good signing.       Him and Justin McCariens, sounds soo sweet. Then we can trade Gage and Young for a 7th Round Pick. SWEEEETTT. SPORTS F'ING ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's such a joke! They are blowing every team out by 25+ points in their conference. Please get them out of Conference USA. What's the point of them even playing these teams. They shouldn't even count their conference games, they should just give Memphis a bye through conference play, and send them straight to the tourney. The best solution is to send them to the Big East, SEC, or ACC.

20090307185232AApz8pI	Sports;Wrestling	Guys, what do u think of this wrestling statement (inside) ?	This came from one of the users in certain fansite :      "Shawn Michaels may have been better at wrestling than Taker when Shawn was in his prime.   That is no longer the case. Taker has continually gotten better, learning new moves and recreating his gimmick many times. Shawn Michaels has progressively gotten worse, and he’s never changed his gimmick. He is no longer able to get 5 star matches out of people like he used to. The last good match he had was at WM 19 with Jericho. I don’t know why everyone thought the matches those two put on last year were good, I thought they were sh*tty compared to their WM 19 match. Just more evidence that Michaels isn’t what he used to be.   I think he will be the let down in this WM match, Taker will be carrying the match, especially if he wins it, because Michaels hates to lose, especially at WM. So he’s going to be lazy and pissy all through the match, like Hogan at Judgment Day 2002. I don’t know how many people were watching WM in 2007 live, but Michaels chucked a fit before his match with Cena because he didn’t want to lose. I’m expecting him to pull a similar stunt this year. Because it’s no secret that Michaels and Taker don’t like each other."      Please tell me your opinion, OK?      For trolls and haters, why so serious ?

I've been watching videos of matches all day. I've noticed something like nearly all of the 5 star matches or legendary matches had either a superplex, a superplex counter, or the wrestlers battled on top of the turnbuckle.      Now tell me a 5 star match, or a fantastic match where there wasn't a surperplex, or battle on the turnbuckle.      WQ2- Since I highly doubt that people will find one, which current main eventer in the WWE dislikes his current gimmick.

He's a big Raptors fan, and he says that his uncle is Chris Bosh's penis. So, according to my friend, Bosh's penis (my friend's uncle) has never been inside of a vagina. And the penis told his nephew that an awesome NBA player is a virgin, and my friend thought this was amazing. Has anyone else heard that Bosh is a virgin? I just found it surprising that an NBA player hasn't had sex.

20090307190558AA76sQC	Sports;Basketball	Has there ever been an NBA season before where four teams have reached 60 wins?	That's what four teams are on pace to do now. Cleveland is on pace for 65, Boston for 64, Orlando for 60, and Los Angeles for 66. How ridiculous  is that? Plus it just goes to show you how good the Eastern Conference is that 60 wins will only get you the third seed.

Okay, so I've never played soccer before and I'm already 14 (I'm a girl btw), which I think, is a little too late for wishing that I would exceed all those girls who've been playing it all their lives. But whatever, I feel happy when I play it, I've been praticing with my brother who is in varsity team, and I absolutely love the feeling of running and playing with the ball, so I'm thinking, screw them, I'll outrun them by practice, practice, practice. The trouble is, I don't really know whole lot of soccer drills, tactics, and stuff. I've learned from my bro that I should pass using the inside of my foot, but my shoot isn't accurate and it doesn't go straight like my bro's. So, I would appreciate any advice as long as it's about soccer.

I also have a pretty high pain tolerance.. but do you think that will be enough layers or whatever to keep the paintballs from bruising and welting me and stuff? like i've gotten hit in the back by the ball during lacrosse and it's bruised but didn't hurt..So any advice in general is needed. thankss.

First, he should have not brought  Alex Ruoff  back into the game. Second he should have hacked a Shaq ( fouled until the end of play and turn the game into a free throw match ). Lastly, he should have told his team to foul with 46 seconds left on the clock. Bob Huggins should be fired. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure this out or a great head coach.      Even though West Virginia got some bad non-call fouls it didn't cost us the game. Only time you should complain about fouls is if it costs you the game.

20090307202653AAj6cEu	Sports;Running	Heart pain when running...?	Well, I have two questions to ask...      1) I am 195 pounds, 17 years old, and 5' 8"... meaning I am obese. I used to be an athlete but I've really slacked off for the past two years which has brought a huge gain in my weight... So I've been doing the walk for a few minutes, jog for a minute kind of thing... The problem is that when I run, I get this horrible heart pain... I really want a true answer... People say it is because I've been out of shape for awhile... Also, because I'm fat, my legs cannot endure my weight... So how can I improve my calf muscles etc... Also please tell me some good tips in improving stamina and running in general... I need to try out for the track team in the spring of 2010 so can I get tips on running or maybe even things like shot put etc... I really need to get my athletic look back...      2) My other question is that if I burn off five hundred calories working out and take 500 calories out of my diet, will that help me lose about 50 pounds in about five months?      I would really appreciate some good answers :)...

This year there's been a suggestion to shake it up and switch to a head to head league. I've never done it before and am wondering what the advantages/ disadvantages will be. I'd prefer a daily lineup system if that's possible. Any comments from those who have played both? What do you prefer and why? Can FA's be added and used during the week? Does it balance the league a bit, or will a good team be more likely to run away with it? Should I change my league settings from what we had for rotisserie scoring (Innings Pitched, Games, etc) I am worried about changing over... Thanks.
