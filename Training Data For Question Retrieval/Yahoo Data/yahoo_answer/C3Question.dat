20090202161227AAkWhkx	Politics & Government;Politics	Is "Liberal media bias" simply code for the fact that neoconservatism has failed and offers no new ideas?	Every day I hear about it... but I don't see it.  Fox News is the "most watched" news network in America.  CLEARLY it is as conservatively biased as MSNBC is liberally so, and Fox proudly proclaims that far more people actually WATCH its programming than the more liberal network.  Talk radio... well anyone who has ever listened even briefly knows that the conservative bias there borders upon fascism/ultranationalism.  Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is unapologetically conservative and the 4th largest media company in the nation.  Time Warner is the largest media company in the world by revenue.... the former CEO of Time Warner Richard Parsons was a well-known Republican and gives generously to the GOP.  The current one (since 2007), Jeff Bewkes, is a Democrat.      Conservatism has the Wall  Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune (maybe even the formerly "liberal rag" the Washington Post)... Liberalism has the New York Times and the online Huffington Post.      It plays both ways.... yet it is the conservatives (who like to pride themselves on toughness) who are doing ALL of the whining.  How is it that those who are always about being on the attack (be it in politics or with live ammunition) have been reduced to pitiful whining about feigned injustice.        How can those who watch Fox News, which has been accused by its own employees of taking a top-down approach to its editorials (that's just a fancy way of saying the CEO/Board tells them what to reports on and how) then claim that it all of the OTHER news agencies (CBS, AP, Reuters, NBC) are the ones manipulating the news???  That is the irony in all of this.... the network that actually DOES manipulate what is reported is very likely the network that promotes the concept of a "liberal bias"  It is just ludicrous.        Don't think Fox News does this???  Run a search on Charlie Reina...former producer and copy editor for Fox News and get it straight from the source.... he was force-fed "news" to promote an ideology for years at Fox... and he has said so publicly.      I suppose it does make sense when you look at it from the point of view of a Fox executive... you have to have some explanation WHY every other news agency in the world interprets events differently than your network.      Liberal bias...conservative bias.... blah blah blah.....ONLY YOU choose your sources and you have PLENTY to choose from.  The only bias out their is the reality of what is going on on the world.... and how YOU decide to interpret it.        My suggestion.... never get your news from less than one COUNTRY let alone one media outlet.  What do you think?

I'm sorry but I was going through the forums about Proposal 2 and all the replies were about "white" this, "white" that, "I lost my job because of Affirmative Action", gimme a break. Don't put me in that category of "SLACKER HIRE!" Cause I'm WELL Qualified, more Experience, and more Educated.      There have been plenty of times I tell myself this, "Why is he even my boss?" He doesn't even know what he is talking about! I ask him, "How you get this job?" He answers, "My dad knows one of the corporate guys." So hiring someone just because daddy's knows someone = "EDGE". No ****** wonder our economy is downhill. I believe we NEED only the BEST in our schools as well as in our Businesses, Corporation, work place, etc; or we'll lose this Global Competition.

20090202211111AAmY9Ab	Politics & Government;Politics	Anyone here support global federalism?	I do for a variety of reasons, but most importantly - and this may seem paradoxical to the Alex Jones type - but I think it would result in a vast INCREASE in personal freedoms, good governance, and political liberties throughout the world.       My reasoning is thus: people tend to be far, far more tolerant of coercive government, totalitarian power grabs, public corruption, etc.  when they share a national identity with those doing the coercing/thieving/whatever. On the other hand, most people tolerate none of this from perceived foreigners, especially foreign occupiers. If we had a multinational government on the global level, I think it's very reasonable to assume that people would view it with a high degree of skepticism, and would thus create immense pressure on such a government to perform well. This would in turn foster a culture of accountability for national governments.      Furthermore, it's not as if issues of global significance aren't already dealt with in the current system of nation-states - albeit in a very makeshift, haphazard, ineffectual way. For those concerned about the power such a government could wield and its effect on civil liberties, transferring those responsibilities to a global federal government could well result in more freedom, as it would further divide power and pits powerful interests against each other.      Finally, it seems that there's little use in fighting it; global governance of some sort is inevitable sooner or later if human development continues. Assuming further development beyond that, the next form of governance would be at the level of the solar system - it's just the natural evolution of things.      Provided that a world government has a strong constitution, deeply entrenched civil/political liberties, an independent judiciary and the like, would you support such a government? Why or why not?

20090202203730AAVjNZl	Politics & Government;Politics	Why don't Liberals Understand that Abortion is Murder?

I don't believe in souls, or life at conception, and you're not going to convince me that 1st or 2nd trimester abortion should be banned. And most of America agrees with me. Tough luck for you, bub. "      I will now refute each of these points:   -Government interference: The government intervenes in the case of murder, and has done so since its creation.   -Clump of cells: What do you think people are? Look at yourself under a microscope. Guess what you'll see? Clumps of cells. I could just as easily dehumanize you by calling you a "clump of cells", but it would still be murder to kill you.   -Life at Conception: You don't believe in life at conception? Why not?   -Most of America Agrees with me: Actually, most of the judges during Roe V. Wade agree with you. Of course, you would never let it come to a vote.      You want to bring in the case of rape? Fine. You don't want to see it? Fine. Give the child up for adoption. My best friend was raped, luckily she didn't become pregnant.

But what about those who would do so unwillingly?          let us not debate if it is constitutinal or not, but rather :   If you were drafted, would you join up or dodge the draft?   If you were drafted, would you start being more active in protesting the war?   What are your thoughts on America's current wars.

Since most police departments in this area don't pay more than $11-12/hour, I have decided to take a reserve position and keep a better paying full time job (until I can move out to Springfield, KC or St. Louis).      Anyways, this department requires me to purchase my own duty weapon. I currently own a Ruger P89 that I bought used for the academy, but it is close to 15 years old and not the most reliable weapon. So I want something much newer and more reliable. Caliber really isn't an issue so much for me, but I would prefer .40 or something in that general area.      I'm not big into handguns, so I wanted to know what else is out there in addition to Glocks. I'm looking to spend around $700.      Thank you.

He hasn't paid a penny of it because he is an illegal alien and is unemployed. She has no job so all the money she gets she uses for herself pretty much and buys the kid a few things here and there.  Isn't this illegal?

20090202222804AAGUv5L	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do most of the Republicans here object to being called Neocons when it describes their ideology accurately?	Neoconservatism is a political philosophy that emerged in the United States. Its key distinction with classical conservatives is in international affairs, where it espouses an interventionist approach that seeks to defend what neo-conservatives themselves deem as national interests. In addition, unlike traditional conservatives, neoconservatives are comfortable with a minimally-bureaucratic welfare state; and, while generally supportive of free markets, they are willing to interfere for overriding social purposes      Jonathan Clarke, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, proposed the following as the "main characteristics of neoconservatism"[35]:      "a tendency to see the world in binary good/evil terms    low tolerance for diplomacy    readiness to use military force    emphasis on US unilateral action    disdain for multilateral organisations    focus on the Middle East".

20090202225858AAu8p0e	Politics & Government;Politics	How should we as Americans thank Denny's for their generous deal?	In case any of you weren't watching the Super Bowl commercials, from 6AM tomorrow (Feb. 3rd) to 2PM, Denny's is giving out free Grand Slams to anyone throughout their restaurants (The only two stores not participating is the Denny's at 350 Baker Blvd. in Baker, CA, and the one at 740 Main St. in Las Cruces, NM.). No paperwork, no buying anything first, just a big platter of American Breakfast-y goodness. (They're also doing this in Canada and Puerto Rico, too.) Here's a link to prove it.       http://www.dennys.com/       In this time of worldwide economic slump, most companies wouldn't dare do something like that. Not even in times of prosperity, because it's just too expensive. And as the economy gets worse we're saving what few dollars we have left when companies need them the most. (Hence the bailouts: had we been in good shape, they would've been doing great) Aside from "Going Out Of Business" sales, we don't get very many discounts anymore. American (And the rest of the world's, too) morale has been really low, especially with the news media staying on their rants that this is the worst economic slump in history. Us as a people are hurting.      But Denny's has shown it's giant heart capacity. After all this, "OMG the economy just keeps getting worse and worse, and we're all gonna be broke", they're helping to mend our mood and restore our hope. Everyone is saying, "Wow, that's going to be over 250 million free meals. How can they afford to do that?" and slowly but surely the public will come out from underneath that big dark cloud and look at the sky and be able to say, "Hey, things aren't so bad. After all, if a chain of restaurants can afford to give away over 250 million meals normally valued at $8.50, then I can certainly afford to do a little spending myself!" And once we get back our confidence (no thanks to the media), we'll be back in prosperity in no time.      After a year of economic woes and other problems, America is finally going to get a fair deal, courtesy of Denny's.      How can we thank them for that?

I agree he is an intelligent man and color does not matter, but if color doesn't matter then what is all the excitement about? I think he is a man who everyone could be proud to call their president. Does anyone else feel the only people who make a big deal about this are the racist themselves? I felt as though nothing was different when he was elected maybe this is because its hard for me to just notice someones color. But it makes me mad when people just talk about his skin color, and I feel its racist to Caucasian people when people are just ignoring his white heritage and calling him black. I just think it is unfair to not only Caucasian people but mixed races when people call him "black" because its like our race is not worth mentioning. What are everyone else's opinions?   Also, if African Americans are proud because of his African heritage, then are any of you upset that alot (not all) of the black people in the public eye (like celebs: Halle Berry,etc) are biracial and not 100 percent African heritage? As if someone was saying you have to be light colored, and if the public likes this so much why not recognize biracial mixes more?         Please dont be mean or call me racist because I am not, I am married to a black man and we have biracial kids. Just wanting some different opinions. Best Answer= 10 points
20090202215212AAKZDe5	Politics & Government;Military	MEPS. What if a girl has her period while at meps? And a question about a disease?	Ok so I'm enlisting in the Army National Guard. I have been trying to go to MEPS for about a month now but it keeps getting rescheduled because I have a scar on my back from a mole being removed and the MEPS doctor wants EVERY possible paperwork on it. My recruiter has given her everything that was ever written about it, and the doctor still wants more. Either way we sent another copy of everything and the doctor is reviewing it now. So I was scheduling to go when I didnt have my period but now it keeps getting pushed back and I might end up going next week (finally!) but i'll probably have my period. For girls, do they do a full gyno exam? Because that would be a problem then.    Also I have another question/problem. 6-7 years ago I came down with a disease called shingles. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles  ) It was years and years ago and when I was filling out my medical history it completely slipped my mind. I'm worried if I mention it, it'll take atleast another month to get all the paperwork cleared, and I'm worried that the MEPS doctor will just disqualify me for having to deal with so much from me. Also my mom said if I dont tell MEPS, she will. (She doesnt want me to enlist and she said her only hope is that I fail at MEPS) But the thing is my shingles is gone. It's been gone, and I highly doubt I'll ever get it back. In most cases it is a one time thing that lasts a few weeks. I didnt have a severe case either, it only lasted a week. So do i just wait for word from my recruiter on when I'm going to MEPS, or do I bring up shingles, and embark on my journey to gather all the paperwork for it from years ago?

20090202225530AAUeLqQ	Politics & Government;Immigration	Are there actually ''illegal'' Irish immigrants in the United States?	When I first heard this, I thought it was a mid-nineteenth century novel. Turns out, it's actually something that may or may not exist in 2009.I remember reading something about this during the presidential election. It was like a question for McCain. Someone told me there were some living in Upper Darby in Pennsylvania. Honestly, I just don't get it. When I just hear that, it sounds kind of funny. We're talking about people from a Western European country from the EU. A relatively affluent country with decent education and all that. They're really no different than us, if you think about it. Of course, there's Americans living abroad, as well as Irish, British and who ever else living abroad, but to intentionally not have your papers right in a country that seems to have a similar standard of living seems weird. Especially considering the people who they'd be living around are labeled unintellectual simpletons in their continent. Sadly, there's some truth to that, but to see there's illegal Irish immigrants in America is like saying there are illegal American immigrants in Canada. Which there probably are, although not many.      So, there's really two answers I'm looking for. Either this is not true or so insignificant, that it's meaningless. Or two, there are ''illegal'' Irish immigrants in the United States. If that's your answer, please state why you believe such. More importantly though, the question I'd ask is why.      If you're going to be illegally residing in any country, why go to one that is so far away? Why leave such a prominent region of the world to another to not live well?

How do I word that? Do I just keep it short like "Petitioner has a new child to support" or should I go into detail "As of March 7, 2008 the petitioner has had a new child to support.  DCE is unable to adjust the case for 5 years as the child support order was signed off by the court."

She thought it was outrageous how so many people can can make claims like "I'm not American as long as he's in office." and "I didn't vote for him, he's not my president."  Then she told me when she was young (1940s) that people stood by their president no matter what party they belonged to. So why can't we come together now, and at least wait until Obama actually messes up? Why be so judgmental when you have nothing but a grudge or hate towards the other party?

My roommate/landlord was arrested for assaulting me and I was granted a TRO against her.She is not allowed in her own apartment and I am here. Our final hearing is on Thursday. If I lose the case and the judge doesn't grant the final restraining order then she can come back into the apartment. I have no money to move my stuff, I am not prepared right now, no place to go, and this extremely dangerous person will be here with me.     I just need a little time to earn some money to move, is it likely the judge would allow me just to have that? I'm not looking for a million dollars but in some cases the defendant will have to provide relocation or housing assistance to the victim. Is it likely I can get that? I live in NJ.

20090203012022AA8eIF0	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I be prosecuted for crashing my friends car? ?	Ok...here's the situation..i had been hosting a bartending graduation party when i felt the need to go for ciggerettes. I was pursuing to go walk since the place wasn't so far but was convinced to drive there. To all of my friends, I was apparently drunk. To her, i was fine and perfectly normal. I had made it down to the store and back ok until i had to park. When parking I had sped too quickly and rammed the back into the car into a pole. I and her was ok but the car was totaled in the back. I parked it aside and acessed the situation. Due to me not having a liscence, being driving under the influence, and having not nearly anything to be able to fix the damages right away, obiviously i'm stressed. I had to finish off a few finacial obligations that had finished this month. But this is the month i owe her. The crash was not reported to the insurance on her behalf( she insisted due to her father) and i told her it was a bad idea to say it was a hit and run while the car was parked. So far the only attempt i had in fixing the car was throughout the first week. Which was so the car was aleast drivable with the tail lights working. That was 300 from my pocket. Then I find out from her and times going out that after the accident, doesn't really try to take care of the car after by hitting little poles, walls, or backing into objects to make space for parking. Then after that i get a her story telling me that the car has gone through alot in the past with engine and transmission problems with starting or running the car. Following that I i find out that she had been tickected for driving with no liscence because after the accident, she did not want to take the car to the insurance agency so discontinued to use the insurance. But she was tickected out by venice beach living in granada hills. At first the amount she had asked for was 5,000 for a 98 nissan, i belive. But now her dad has told her to tell me that it is now at 3,000 for the damages. I'm concerned because from the intial car crash to a month later with tickets to having the car break down again two months later. I just don't know what to expect anymore because I have been working with my same job and had 2 other side jobs to try to pay this but i haven't been able to, especially now with a problem at work with how they did their taxes on the tips( all the workers are goin to have thier pay checks reduced or tips removed) and now to get this to haunt me again now. It has been about 9 months now and they are asking for the money. What am i facing is i guess my true question but what other solutions are there? I have been going through too many trail by fire moments these last few months without end and gotten through but I am tired and having to deal with my finances at work to be able to pay. I thank you for your time.

20080926141443AADB8Yx	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Juvenile Speeding Ticket...Cop Forgot Speed?	Hi I got a Speeding Ticket this summer in California for 60 mph in a 45 mph zone. I am due in court on October 7, 2008 in a fairly harsh court so I've heard. I am under 18, so I know it is harder for me to plead not guilty. However, I was wondering what I should do get out of this considering the fact that the officer wrote SPEED and the violation number but forgot to write the actual speed and what he used to measure it. Is this worth fighting? I just don't want to deal with traffic school and what not. I was thinking I might say that I can't have due process if I'm unsure of my allegation. Honestly, I don't remember if I admitted guilt when I got pulled over, but I do remember saying I was sorry and that I had never been pulled over before and could he let me off with a warning? (didn't work) Thanks!

I had my hair done at a reputable salon and explained to the senior technician IN DETAIL how I want the end result to turn out. He told me not to worry about a thing since he understands perfectly what I want. After 4 hours of "fixing" my hair, it turned out okay and I actually paid almost $300 for it.       Unfortunately, after 3 days, it turned out the way I had hoped it would NOT be. And I'd have to endure this for more than a year (my hair grows slow) if they don't do anything about it.      I will be complaining about this but I just want to be armed and ready and feel secured that if they don't fix it (or rather it turned out worse than before), or they don't give me any refund for this, can I file a lawsuit against them just based on not following instructions or not being satisfied as a customer?       Thanks guys.

20090202195901AASmnBO	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Am I committing fraud If I do not disclose an Injury to human resources, I was not on duty or on their prop.?	My human resource manager said I was guilty of fraud because I did not disclose an injury to her that I suffered outside of work. I disclosed to my immediate supervisor the incident when it occurred and worked with him on the scheduling of my appointments.. He was also notified of any results of my various tests. The incident occurred after I was hired. Human resources said that I should have come to her, yet in the employee handbook it states that I notify my immediate supervisor of any doctor appointments. I have been undergoing tests for 9 months, two MRI's and and E.M.G. The E.M.G. was positive for a pinched nerve. I had a myelogram two weeks ago and it was discovered that I had several pinched nerves and a slipped disc. There is a lawsuit connected with this injury but it has nothing to do with work or my employer. Human resources said that Hepa law states that my supervisor was not allowed to disclose to human resource my condition.. When I received the results of my Myelogram, my Neurologist suggested and wrote a note stating that I should be put on light duty until I speak with the Neurosurgeon. Human resource has now stated that I cannot return to work until I have a document, that the company provided, filled out by my Neurologist listing my specific restrictions. She says that I am a good employee and she does not want to fire me over this. She say's that she feels like she cannot trust me now. I have been up front with the company and thought I was following procedures. I could use some good advice on this matter.

20090202213544AA095qD	Politics & Government;Politics	Is being a libertarian just as difficult as it must be to be the character Cassandra from Homer's Iliad?	source:  http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite...       Being a libertarian means living with a level of frustration that is nearly beyond human endurance. It means being subject to unending scorn and derision despite being inevitably proven correct by events. How does it feel to be a libertarian? Imagine what the internal life of Cassandra must have been and you will have a pretty good idea.      Imagine spending two decades warning that government policy is leading to a major economic collapse, and then, when the collapse comes, watching the world conclude that markets do not work.      Imagine continually explaining that markets function because they have a built in corrective mechanism; that periodic contractions are necessary to weed out unproductive ventures; that continually loosening credit to avoid such corrections just puts off the day of reckoning and inevitably leads to a larger recession; that this is precisely what the government did during the 1920's that led to the great depression; and then, when the recession hits, seeing it offered as proof of the failure of laissez-faire capitalism.       For those of you who don't know who Cassandra was, see:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra

I understand that air pollution affects health, that if we run out of fresh water we will suffer, and that climate change could bring serious economic and social problems. Are these "liberal" ideas, or just common sense?       ...or could it be that most people assume that anyone who shows any level of environmental concern is an environmental extremist?

Yet the media and Obama worshipers pardon Obama for attending a racist church since he "apologized" But if it was someone like Sarah Palin in a church like that then God forbid. What do you think?

They didn't notify us (her parents).       This incident was regarding a friend of hers and some shoes that were reported stolen. The girl shares a locker with my daughter. They went through her locker and went through her cell phone friends list.      They were questioning her as a witness. What are some legal issues to bring to their attention when I go down there tomorrow?

20090202213341AAErJkh	Politics & Government;Politics	A question for those who support Michael Steele?	Michael Steele is a strong fiscal conservative who is opposed to wasteful spending, social programs, earmarks and pork, and he loudly spoke out against ALL of the bailouts.      When it comes to social issues, there are 3 that may concern some conservatives:      1) Affirmative Action: Michael Steele is FOR affirmative action...This is based on his own experiences growing up in poverty...When he first started out, determined to make his own way WITHOUT welfare or any form of government assistance he was hitting roadblocks because of employer discrimination...Filing discrimination lawsuits isn't easy when you can't afford a good lawyer, and the state appointed lawyers in some areas can't do much to prove discrimination in places where a discriminitive employer can easily say "He wasn't qualified" when he really meant "he wasn't white enough"...This sort of thing does NOT happen where I live, but it did happen where Steele grew up, and where he was encouraging his friends to get off of welfare and pull themselves out of poverty...His friends were also experiencing discrmination.      I am opposed to affirmative action, because I personally have seen the opposite happen...I've seen too many people abuse affirmative action in the union...Minorities given positions that they weren't qualified for, only because of their race, while a more qualified white person was denied the position because the quota needed to be filled...It goes both ways...I believe that every person should have a chance based on their own merit, not their skin color...I won't pretend that discrimination doesn't exist, but I don't believe that it occurs on a scale large enough to support the need for affirmative action         2) Abortion: Michael Steele is strongly opposed to abortion...But, he believes that Roe V Wade should be left up to the Supreme Court to make any descicisons on, and he has stated that he would not attempt to overturn Roe V Wade personally...He also says that the issue of abortion should be left up to the states...Basically, while he is personally opposed to abortion, he doesn't feel that he has the right to make decisions about it for the entire country      I am strongly against abortion...Yet I know that as a political issue, it isn't going anywhere...I want to know where a person stands on this issue, because it tells me what kind of person they are, not because I believe they will be able to stop abortion...As sad as it is, we have to realize that it isn't going to just stop.         3) Death Penalty: Michael Steele is opposed to the death penalty...He's afraid that innocent people would be put to death, most especially poor people and minorities who couldn't legally defend themselves, and wouldn't be appointed a lawyer who really cared...He saw this happen every day, all around him (not the 'put to death' part, but the 'incarceration with little or no provocation' except that you were poor or a minority)...It concerned him...I can't fault him for that concern, and I allow him his beliefs.      I support the death penalty...I believe that there are ways to prove positively in many cases that someone is guilty, and I believe that a murderer who took someone else's life, shouldn't be given the chance that they didn't allow their victim      Michael Steele and I didn't grow up in the same neighborhood, with the same world view...So, our opinions differ...I can accept that...While I disagree with some of his stances, I still support the man.      Personally, I'm not nearly as concerned with social issues as I am with national security and economy, Michael Steele is strong in these areas      How do other conservatives feel about these issues?

I got pulled over by the state trooper because he said my tint was illegal. I tried to explain to him the reason i had them like that but he did not want to hear it. My brother usually stays with me and that means i have to take him to doctor appointments. He has been diagnosed with lupus therefore he can not have any sun exposure to his skin. My tint is not limo black, its a little darker than normal tint. I just want to know if that ticket can be removed so I do not have to pay for it because of my brothers condition????
