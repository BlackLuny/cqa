pcjOQDymaa	do a desert.  the others sound ridiculeous.
UA8zGGTsaa	For most people, a right.     But there are some people who should NEVER reproduce.    And, unfortunately, for whatever reason, some people that would be AMAZING parents are unable to have children.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	well its a right   people dont need to be given the abilty to have kids so it cant be taken from them like how tv privileges is|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	It should definitely be a priveledge.  But then again, if half the morons I think shouldn't have kids didn't get to have any, then the world would be grossly underpopulated.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Privilege! I see so many unfit parent's out there. If you want to see them all you can see them at our local Wal-Mart... LOL!    You have to have a license to own a dog... a child is no where comparable to a dog but you can have as many as you want.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I think it is my right to procreate if i so choose and it is my privilege to raise them|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	an accident ..like it usually is|`|dPULl5hjaa	privilege|`|oP504BtFaa	Both. This could get confusing...    I think that it is every woman's right to have the choice to have children. You can take it or leave it, it's 100% up to you and no one should or can put a limit or any other rules on that (except that you need to care for them, of course.)    However, it's also a privilege that some mother's cannot have. Myself, for instance. I've always wanted to be a mother since I was a little girl and believed it was my RIGHT to be a mother, but I couldn't get pregnant without some help. Now I have four daughters, and it is truly a privilege to have them|`|VuUz8NgKaa	A privilege|`|7PNbjit0aa	I think it is a right UNTIL you forgo that right by neglecting or abusing your child.  At that point it becomes a privilege that you no longer deserve.|`|f4d95cfe6010fdbb2024a827389acfc0aa	it should be a right to begin with to peopel that are ready to be parents and can afford everything that the child would need....But it is a privilege for the people who screw around get pregnant and dont really want the kid and are too young and not responsible enough to take of it....|`|iCLGHUdQaa	It SHOULD be, sadly that will never happen!    But yes, there a plenty of people out there who aren't capable of being parents...who shouldn't be parents, but this is me being judgmental.    Too many kids are neglected physically and emotionally.  If we had to pass a test to be a parent like we do for everything else in life - I think things would be much different.|`|8nNF3t65aa	It's definitely a privilege. Having a hammer and saw doesn't make you a carpenter, and having the ability to procreate doesn't make one a good parent. Having sex and producing kids is easy compared to the process of raising them. People who are selfish, lazy, impatient, drug-addicted, etc. have no right to have custody of children. Take Casey Anthony, for example - she certainly didn't deserve that beautiful, sweet little girl of hers.|`|1J43qnOJaa	should be a privilege but obviosly it's a right, anyone can do it    except infertile ppl
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Shock treatment? I thought they stopped that years ago. I know someone who is bi-polar and they have medication. Why not just tell your mother how you feel. But realistically, if she needs this, you need to accept it and show support. ??|`|pcjOQDymaa	oh im sorry.  just try to help her out too,  but i mean seriously?  youre being selfish.  its not her fault that she has this.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	i'm so sorry htat u have to do this. if ur mom is aware that she has this, thenjust tell her that u will keep a journal/write her a letter with stuff u want for her to know to rebuild ur relationship... also try talking to a counselor at school they might have some good ways to help u. for now, just breathe & when things get a little more stable (ina few hrs or tomorrow) suggest the idea that i gave u... it might help.   good luck :]|`|5i1J2RLLaa	She is your mother for godsake, you move out then, not her. Did she ask to be bi-polar? You need to get used to it, you are not the only child living with a bi-polar victim. And where do you live that they use shock treatment? It is called Lithium, it is a pill patients can take. So deal with it because I am sure your poor mother isn't enjoying matters either.|`|l1STgPyRaa	yes ECT is not a nice treatment for her or you i would Imogen, i am sorry you are going though it.    do you have a relative to stay with? that will take you on full time and not just while she is getting the ECT? you need to tell your mother about how it is effecting you! but if the ECT is working for her then it is better then her not having it and doing something like your dad did.     ECT is something I have never liked as if it was a drug it would never get FDA approval as there is no prof that it works. but then also if she (your mother) was to have the right amount of drugs in her system maybe she would not be able to function at all (I have seen that often too)     So again I think maybe your best answer would be to have her give up rights to you to someone in the family if you and she can find or have someone that is willing to do this for you     Good luck with this|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	I'm very sorry that you are dealing with this.   Do you have a place that you can stay at with relatives or close friends who are like family?  I strongly suggest you talk to a counselor at school on Monday.    There needs to be another adult who can take care of your mom during this time.    There are services available to help you  and your mom with this difficult situation.   Stay strong and God bless.   Here's a song that has always been inspiring to me when I need a lift  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhuDJgpKk...    And the same song from the original singer in 1972.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaVXfHZv5...|`|55AOkGa5aa	im sorry to hear that...but...your not the only one this is happening to.....Its a medical disorder there is nothing you can really do about it... god wouldnt had dealt you these cards if he didnt think you could handle it...best of luck..
rx0ekB9Paa	no ur ok. my doctor said when your in your first trimester if something is going to hurt the baby,it will just kill it. i know thats harsh sounding but thats what she said.    i got wasted for 2 weeks straight(my hubby came home for R&R) and i asked this question to my dr|`|5J0sIvksaa	No. Just DON'T drink any more. It wasn't enough to hurt the baby at that early of a stage.|`|HGDVgyJTaa	I wouldn't worry about it, I was smashed when I found out I was pregnant with my 1st, alot of women dont find out there preg until about that far along and they go on drinking cause they dont know.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	no don't worry.    i was five weeks when i found out i was pregnant and a few weeks BEFORE i found out i got trashed at my friends bday party and i talked to my doctor about it and she said that baby will be fine...    just make that your last drink!|`|QPmTzcGmaa	Relax its okay|`|hHEMhPZyaa	No. Relax, your baby is fine.  It takes repeated, long-term exposure to develop FAS.|`|KN0GQIXaaa	No, but don't drink anymore...you can cause developmental problems for your baby.|`|51736e494ebf305ca5b1cba0d35f09e8aa	just 2 times drinking....? definitely not, stop worrying please|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Probably not but they don't know how much alcohol cause FAS so the safest amount is none.|`|Ax5mw8dVaa	Don't worry I drank when I was that early too  And they said nothing will go happen  Unless I continue drinking  Which obviously I did not continue  So don't stress out  Because you stressing could cause more problems  Then having those drinks|`|k9nLue0Uaa	doubt it and they say you can even have a glass of red wine every now and then. I dont but some do.
Tc23KWgzaa	If your son is Brycen, he's Brycen.  Brycen Anthony is wonderful.    TX Mom|`|cR8UZdi1aa	I say if you like it, then name him Brycen. I do like that name, it's unique & goes well with Anthony. But If I had to choose one for you, how about "Braydon, Brighton, Brandon, or Brian" ? I like all those & are similar to Brycen.|`|VjFCNozjaa	I like Bryce Anthony - one thing though if your last name starts with an M you may want to reconsider.    We named our son Brady Austin M---- thinking we would just use all 3 initials but everyone else uses 2 so when his teachers write it it's always BM.|`|9g734Pjaaa	Truth be told, I don't like Brycen myself. But I wouldn't shy away from a name you really love just because your best friend doesn't like it. Yet it really can be hard to make a personal decision if someon else disagrees with you. I say go with Brycen if you love Brycen, but if you decide you want more choices for boys try Laura Wattenberg's "The Baby Name Wizard" for a really fun but practical guide to naming, or Bruce Lansky's "Baby Names Around the World" for a broader and more multicultural array (but just know that the former is a baby name GUIDE and the latter is a baby name dictionary). Both books are outdated stastically, so for current statistics, you can try http://behindthename.com or http://babynamesworld.com (I love Behind the Name because it allows users to comment on names - there is no entry on the site for Brycen but there is one for Bryson, and people have left comments).    Some of my very favorite boys' names include Neil, Oliver, Isaac, Hans, Luther, Jackson, Casper/Caspar, Jasper, Alden, Luke/Lucas, Benjamin, William, and Phillip. Yes, yes, I know I am a tad old-fashioned (being a lover of Mildred, Mavis, and Mabel for girls) ...|`|SiaWY5n2aa	its your baby. you chose the name. just remeber he will have the name for life. the nickname is really good. congrats on the baby|`|IwBIM1tVaa	No I don't too weak he will be a man someday he needs a man's name|`|jXpV0CAlaa	i don;t like the name but he is your kid!!!!!|`|yOFWD0unaa	Wow I've never actually heard that name before but really like it! It goes well with Anthony! When I have a boy I'm naming him Brycen lol. Oh and who cares what your friend thinks, it's your baby, you have to push him out, not your friend lol|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Bryce Anthony sounds better then Brycen Anthony and since you will likely call him Bryce, why not just go with that?|`|V1Ev5s1laa	Just because your best friend hates it doesnt mean you have to change it! your the mom...do what you want to do. and its a VERY cute name.    Suggestions:    Tyler  Tye  Dillan  Cole   Parker  Jake   Jason  Leo  Jacob  Alex  Mikey (micheal)  Garrett  Sean or Shawn  Carlos  Steven  Adam  Chris  Marko (Mar-co)  Mirko (Meer-co)  Donald  Edwin  Brian or Bryan  Rian or Ryan  Geoffrey  Tim or Timothy  Clay  James  J.T  C.J  T.J  Austin  Oliver  Jackson    plenty more 2!|`|gAPwYArkaa	Im not a huge fan of Brycen but i do like Bryden,|`|87WOSjwgaa	I like the name but what about spelling it Bryson instead? Just a suggestion. I also like Bryce! I think that it would be a wonderful name!|`|y46ZQItQaa	Love it.|`|nJn7WjZ4aa	i like A.J. but i am bias...and you can have the first name starting with an A and the middle name starting with a J. then you have options!!!|`|kWKZoQogaa	Yes! And it's not your best friend's choice. It's yours and your husband/significant other's decision, if there is one.|`|Fml5V53Baa	Not to be a ***** or anything, but it's you child, what should your best friend care? Name him Brycen if that's what you like! I like it it's a little bit different!|`|ISNdzRCHaa	It's your baby, so I think you should go with your instincts on this one! You're going to be calling him by his name forever, so if you love a name, then it's totally 100% your call. Bryce Anthony has a great ring to it!|`|mIj6Ccdzaa	It doesn't matter what other people think of the name you choose for your child, it's what you like that matters.  I happen to love the name Brycen.  It's very cute.  I know a little boy names Brycen, I do believe it is spelled Bryson though. Choose what you want, follow YOUR heart and mind.|`|O5TJWiFzaa	Hmmm, not a big fan of Bryce or Brycen, but everyone is different. I named my son Zion, not everyone will like it but I loved it. It is your child, name him what you love in your heart =)|`|qYP3j2Uvaa	I really like the name! It shouldn't matter what your friend thinks of it. She will gt over it!! Name him brycen! It is really cute.|`|bikDnJdlaa	I know a little boy named Bryson...love the name just not sure on your spelling.|`|0eqCf7w4aa	If you LOVE the name BRYCEN, go for it.I think you dont need approval of anyone. besides, that's YOUR son. but if your asking for my opinion, i think you should better take some other name.. like ZANDREI.|`|fD6uCk64aa	how about Kyler Bryce Anthony or something like that|`|eidLWi7iaa	i   likee jordan|`|BOJEbnCtaa	no I don't like Brycen at all. I like Bryce.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	Brycen is a neame I hear for the first time, may be culture specific. On one hand, it's good that it is unique, on the other, make sure no-one will mock your son if the name is too strange.    I like Victor.
3MmVWDT3aa	Go to the principal, or have her go to the principal, and tell him/her straight up what is happening. Those boys can get ISS or even worse- suspended. Also include that the bus driver wouldn't do anything about it.    Harassing is illegal and they can get in SERIOUS trouble for it. Once they are turned in, I don't think they'll do it again.|`|gdvCvWrLaa	First of all you should go to a school asministratorbsuch as yhenprinciple. If they won't to anything about it then she should talk to her parents.  If they still persist in being arrogant when try are humping the seat she should trap a hold of their nuts squeeze really hard and say " if to want to be fully functional I suggest you stop "..     It's harrasment. You can also take it to your SRO ( school resource officer ).|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Aww I'm sorry to hear that. Guys can be such morons, huh?    Anyways you may want to talk to a higher authority, like a principle or house administrator(wait do you guys have those? we do at our school XD) That's pretty stupid that those guys are doing that to her|`|AtTxzYXbaa	That is really wrong.    Can she sit in the front or something where the bus driver can't ignore it?|`|MPjk5wPWaa	hit those jerks in the nuts. thats what i did|`|kBsQSiRCaa	back hand that little boy
Bcfw1rweaa	well, i think definitely that he liked you fer sher....  but now i think hes trying to make you "want' him,  he's keeping you wanting more and it sounds he's being mysterious.  no..... i really think that he likes you.... he is making you jealous. just wait it out. .... and see what happens . you never know whats gonna happen next!!!!  goodd luck. love bridget noelle erin.|`|hQB4TfQFaa	he don't matter!!!!!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Move on. Do you really want to be with a guy like that? He probably does that to feel superior to get girls to jump over hoops for him. ??|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Ahh, I know the feeling. Guys are pretty confusing.    This guy is sending some pretty mixed signals so you may want to talk to him about it.|`|55AOkGa5aa	he an idiot....ignore his *** too...|`|eya1WDS4aa	Boys will be boys. He could be trying to make you jealous or he could have been trying to get you to have sex. boys try to get girls to give it up and when they dont they go away. But its not a bad thing trust me if he is just after you to get in your pants then you deserve way better. Just ignore him and dont pay attention to him and see what happens.
aka2d6Wiaa	it is only normal for you to be watching these shows because you are pregnant and all of these shows are about babies. i bet evey time you finish watching a baby story you cant wait to bring your baby home!

AA10672842	I imagine this woman truly feels she is being a "mother figure " for you.Does she have the same expectations for you as her own daughter?Every household has different rules and expectations ? What does your friend think of her parents ? There must be something that attracts you to their daughter ,in spite of her strict parents? Does your friend seem happy ?I think some of the problems you've had in the past have been situations where you have made poor choices.I think this woman is trying to keep you from making bad choices.She is also going to be concerned how you may influence her daughter.It will not matter to the mom that her daughter is responsible for her own choices. I think you are intimidated by this mother because you realize that basically the things she expects from you are not unfair and that when she "tells on you" she is not trying to get you in trouble.I think if she really didn't like you she would not allow you in her house.Try to be respectful towards her and let her see you aren't the immature girl you  once were.I'm not saying you have to be fake, far from it, but you seemed to have become more mature based on most of your answers..You seem to be becoming a nice young lady with goals and aspirations, let her see this side of you.I'm curious, is there anything about this lady that reminds you of your mom? I know you've said you miss your mom, and rightly so , but could  it be she reminds you that your own mom had hopes and expectations for you?Take care. EDIt on Sunday, Lori, thanks for answering  my questions .I would like to add that  from what we know about your father I'd say he doesn't sound like the type of person who can be easily fooled.I think he respects this woman's input because she is a"little old fashioned" and shares some of the same values and beliefs as your father.You say this lady intimidates you .You say you are afraid to talk back to her because you're afraid she might smack you.I still think that this lady reminds you of your mom in some way.I don't mean that she is like a mother to you but the fact she cares about you and has expectations for you.Both you and your dad seem like strong willed individuals and that is why you butt heads a lot. I don't get te impression that anyone could convince your dad ,or you for that matter, of anything if you didn't think it held a grain of truth.I don't think this lady is trying to be your mother, she's just trying to be motherly. EDIT  Your mom sounds like she was a wonderful mother.it is no wonder you miss her.Take care.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I would ignore it, but one day, I might snap and remind her she isn't my mother. But, I think that might cause more conflicts. I wouldn't go there anymore. ??|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Tell her that if she touches you one more time, you will have the police on her in 5 seconds.|`|KN0GQIXaaa	If you feel that uncomfortable around your friends mom you shouldn't go to her house anymore.|`|MPjk5wPWaa	pshh i know how u feel man...|`|eN5Ju9Zuaa	i wouldn' t go to that house anymore or maybe tell my father or friend about it
5OP7BRscaa	I swaddled my son till he was four months old if he will let you i would say do it.Also i would suggest that you have a chair next to the crib and sit by the crib so he can see you but you don't have to hold him  till he falls asleep.    My son had so many sleep problems it is never to early to start training him to fall asleep on his own so look up some stuff on sleep training it will help and follow a bed time routine this will help lull him to sleep as he gets used to it.    For sure keep swaddling|`|44OH7Si6aa	He isn't too old to swaddle, my daughter HAD to be swaddled every night in order to fall asleep until she was almost one, she'll be three in a couple of weeks and still likes to be tucked in tight at night.   If he's been doing this for just a couple of nights don't worry. Make sure everything is going regularly for him. Is he having his bowl movements, is he maybe getting a little gassy at night? Is he colicy? What is the bed time routine, maybe a bath will help him start to relax and make him less fussy.|`|iUMrd7qlaa	give him a 8 ounces bottle full of formula, warm it up and lay him in the crib with a little sound machine on the top of his crib or a radio silently at the side of his crib. or just let him keep crying until he falls asleep because if not he will never fall asleep by himself in the crib or anything. if you have anymore questions Instant message me on yahoo messenger at MRSMEIER060808. Thanks|`|HqSsNmeUaa	Just snuggle him!  He's too young to worry about getting him to sleep in his own crib... he will eventually... my son is 15 months and we would lay on the couch together till he fell asleep, then I got tired of doing it and he wasn't falling asleep anymore so I just had to do the cry it out method, but at that young of an age he will be ok if you snuggle him for now... everything is still new.|`|k4r4LJG2aa	No, he's not too old for you to swaddle him if you've been doing it all along.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't swaddle my son LONG enough and now it's too late.  he hates to be wrapped up now and i wish I would've done it longer because he wakes up every time he has a reflex and it's arms jump out a mile! Try to swaddle him.  Good luck!  I'm having a real tough time right now even getting mine ( 10 weeks) to sleep in the crib and dealing with his everyday fussing!  It's exhausting!|`|24RnTuB1aa	Babies go through difficult periods that usually correspond to developmental leaps. During these periods, they become fussier and more clingy. According to the book "The Wonder Weeks," which I have found to be a great resource, one of the leaps happens around 8 weeks. That is most likely the reason behind your son's sudden refusal to sleep.    That said, I would not give up on encouraging him to fall asleep on his own. If you give in and start rocking him to sleep, etc., he'll come to expect it all the time.     I found that with my daughter, playing soft music (lullabies, Baby Bach) gently patting her (but not picking her up) and giving her a pacifier was the best combination to encourage her to sleep. The idea was to show her that she wasn't being abandoned, but that bedtime was bedtime. Try different pacifier brands - my daughter spit out every one we tried except for Avent, size 0-3 months. Also, 8 weeks is not too old to swaddle, as long as your baby will still tolerate being swaddled.    Getting babies to learn to sleep on their own is a big challenge, and there are times when they regress, but it can be done. Good luck!
AA10959932	If you close them tightly, they should be sterilized indefinitely.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, why are you sterilizing bottles anyway? recommended by your doc? everything else in your home is covered in 'germs'; babies need to have exposure to common germs to build their immune systems, so trust me if u r sterilizing the bottles, they aren't going to magically become so contaminated that they will in any way harm your baby, although i think it is overkill to do anything other than the manufacturer's instructions regarding boiling the nips, etc...|`|3klIx1Egaa	im not sure, i never sterilized my sons, every time i did he would get sick.  But as far as i know, they are good until the next use. Remember alot of people are going to have mixed opinions on this, so good luck :)|`|HF2HiUQJaa	I sterilized all my daughters bottles at the same time using a microwave sterilizer. I left the unused bottles in the sterilizer until I next needed one. As long as your bottles have been sterilized properly and they are not sitting around collecting dust or germs than they can sit in a closed container until you next need them.|`|SKNxILUqaa	Really I was sterilizing my bottles all the time after each use....then my girlfriend found out and called me crazy! She told me that I only need to wash them with hot soapy water after each use and that I was wasting my time by sterilizing them...she said baby's need to get used to the germs at some point. So the next day I stopped and only sterilize once a week...No problems yet!!!! That was several weeks ago!|`|03szAlNvaa	I have the Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Electronic Steam Steriliser, it takes 5 minutes to sterilise and tells you how long the bottles remain sterile which is around 3 hours but after reading other comments i feel like i've been too careful.|`|zUaCf8coaa	After you sterilize them it is good to put them in the fridge...  The fridge is at a certain temp which bateria doesn't grow at...

ENANtueuaa	Lots of reasons...maybe you were not ovulating at the time, and even if you are ovulating that does guarantee that you will concieve. On average it takes about a year to fall pregnant.|`|pSaUlVa5aa	try again! geez!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I guess because you weren't ovulating at the time of sex.|`|wgr34MqOaa	you prolly didnt time it right.sorry.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You were lucky.

There are only a few days a month when it can happen because many things have to line up - the egg has to be ready, the lining of the uterus has to be just right and fertilization has to take place in time to reach the uterus before the lining starts to die off.|`|aka2d6Wiaa	may be he was shooting out blanks!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	PLEASE!!! make the world a better place and STOP HAVING SEX!!|`|vFBOFecQaa	Getting pregnant is a lot harder than people think.  I've heard that there is about a 24-48 hour optimum window of opportunity to get pregnant (more or less depending on the woman)...     Not to be insulting, but the tone of the question sounds as if perhaps you are a bit young and might need to talk to a family member or a healthcare provider about sex before you continue down this road.  A family is a very real responsibility.|`|te6RmB7taa	u almost make me laugh....huhu.. that's because it's not the correct time u know.. the most encourageble time is in day 14 from the day your period started..this is the time when ovulation happen.|`|sKCGN2i4aa	It all depends on if you have an egg to be fertilized when you have sex.

l1STgPyRaa	if he is a ex then why would you be having sex with him in the first place? that does not make sense at all.      if you think he will force you to have sex with him then don't pick him up, if you have no control over whom gets into your panties then maybe you could think of not going too but really i do not think that is the cases so are you two really ex? if you are then just don't have sex with him simple as that if you are still going out then what is the point in the question|`|TBbf0dQZaa	if u fear getting pregnant so much why even bother going there...?? or take a frnd with u or sth...!!|`|kBsQSiRCaa	just use a condom|`|KN0GQIXaaa	No you shouldn't go over there.  Yes I can blame you for being a teen.  You need to take a cold shower and keep your pants on.|`|N34q6jlBaa	No I do not think you should go hook up with your ex boyfriend. Give a friendly goodbye hug. You're 16 enjoy your adolescence while you can!|`|te6RmB7taa	u realise that you're only 16, right?? so, my answer is  NO! Seriously i don't agree u go.. think before u do something. and always remember that condom does not guarantee anything!|`|r39EDGhPaa	I seriously laughed out loud at this question.    Being a teen? Well, there are a lot of teens with morals and self respect.. which you obviously do not have.  Ugh.. use condoms, I don't want you to get pregnant either.. you're too ignorant to raise a kid.|`|4a2VzINCaa	keep your damn pants on. meet someone new. im a teen too but dont use that lame *** excuse. grow up|`|0dbFAyniaa	as long as you're using condoms, you have a pretty good chance of being fine... if you're that worried, just blow him off and after he moves, you wont have to deal with him|`|8xEBheQsaa	if i were in your position, i honestly just wouldn't have sex with him. he's moving to mexico anyways. meet someone else. but, if you end up having sex with him and getting pregnant...don't use "you can't blame me for being a teen" as an excuse. now that's just dumb...|`|AA10529334	I think you know our advice is going to be to stay home. He is your "ex" for a reason.      Its very close to your ovulation time and pregnancy could be a risk at this time. The timing is not good you understand?    And no I can't blame you for being a teen. But you know how people are always talking about making good decisions - right now is the time to make a good decision!!     Stay home - be careful - you don't want to be a single mom.
GYoNyoWtaa	I'm not really sure what your asking. Edit your question and make it more clear.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No.  That's no longer necessary.    But the safest birth control is doubling up--add a condom, or foam, or jelly, whatever.    TX Mom|`|sKCGN2i4aa	yepp.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	No, you only had to wait the week the first month you started.

df54f1044a5b499adb758231bb8e4a90aa	I think if my Father was not there because of work, I would be a bit saddened. We don't do baby baptisms in our church, but we do baby dedications. My in-laws came to our baby's dedication eventhough they are budhist. My parents could not come because they live 13,000 miles away but we did video tape it for them!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	To a non-religious person a baptism may not be viewed as a very important event. On the other hand very religious people will travel hundreds of miles to be there for family baptisms. It could just be that grandpa isn't really religious and doesn't see the significance. From an outsider standpoint a little baby is getting some water poured on him.    My family is Catholic and I'd expect them to be there for the baptism of all family members. I'm traveling 12 hours in April to see my cousin's son be baptized. But if it wasn't a religious thing that was important to ME, I wouldn't be going.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	Well, I think that it would be nice if he could be there, but sometimes circumstances don't allow people to do what they want. Do you know for sure that he didn't try to change shifts? Even so, sometimes it's hard to do. Asking doesn't always guarantee the response that we hope to get. You are sort of implying that he shouldn't go to work because they have money. Sometimes you just have to let people be.
sMukgX7Xaa	My 1 month old is always fussy as well, but she cries all the time unless eating or sleeping. It might be gas. try the frog position and some mylicon drops...thet work miracles.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	my son is similar to yours. He can be fussy certain days, and some days (thank goodness) not so much.     On his fussy days, I have to hold him and play with him a lot. Nothing in the house gets done. That's all you can do really. My son also has a rash, but he has a mild cash of cradle cap that's tracing down his body. I don't worry much because babies have different temperaments any my son is just a fussy one.     The best thing I could advise is keep your cool. When you get keyed up it makes it so much worse. I also give him a bath at night to settle him down. I also use lavender oil in his bed sheets to facilitate sleep. It really works wonders (they put it in baby lotion!). I also give him a good massage after his bath...he knocks right out for the night. I use Huggies Calming Touch to wash him with and for his lotion.|`|4x8frPUhaa	IDK... really i'm only like 13 yrs old... mabe just tired or something|`|5OP7BRscaa	It takes some time to get the formula out of his system so that could be the problem also my son started getting a rash from crying so hard did you try a bouncer this might help just wait he'll work through it.    By all means take a time out put him somewhere safe and take a break crying never killed anyone don't let yourself get to worked over by his fussy be calm he can sense that.    You'll be ok it will work out and if you feel you need answers seek other doctors for answers.|`|ISNdzRCHaa	Your son, it sounds to me, has infantile eczema aka atopic dermatitis. Two months old is not too young to have this. The rash being all over the body excludes seborrhea, and as you didn't mention anything about fever or puss, I'm assuming it can't really be anything else.    Some simple things to try and resolves this is to make sure you haven't switched to a new laundry detergent, soap, baby shampoo, etc. It could be an allergy to any of these things, and the discomfort could be causing the fussiness. Eczema is very itchy, and the baby can't do anything to resolve this. He could be frusturated if this is the problem. So, try some sort of non scented, basic laundry detergent. And don't use fabric softener sheets when you wash the baby's clothes. If you don't already, which you probably do, use hypoallergenic (which Johnson's and Johnson's is) sensitive skin products. You could try to use the non scented, original baby wash and lotion. Since some have lavendar and all that.     As a side note to that, if it is NOT an allergy to the baby wash or lotion, you may want to try the bedtime calming lavendar scented Johnson's and Johnson's lotion/bath wash. It works like a charm for the fussiness.    Also, if his clothing is too tight or abrasive, the heat can be trapped, and with sensitive baby skin, it can cause a rash (also atopic dermatitis). So, you may want to get some cheap, 100% cotton onesies (since cotton breathes very well) for him to wear in a size up, if the clothing seems snug.    Also, try maybe using a sling when you walk around the house? Sometimes that is soothing, especially if you sort of dance while you walk.    I'm sure once the baby's skin is healthy, he will be less fussy. A main cause of colic, or just plain ol fussiness is rash.|`|OjHFN4imaa	I feel for you! It's so frustrating! I have been there and the good thing is it doesn't last forever!! Your son will eventually grow out of it. Try to figure out ANYTHING that makes it better and go with that. I found that I had to get out a few times a week and just go to Walmart or a friends place..then I had to balance that with staying home too. Also I learned( with my second) that wearing them in a wrap type sling works like a charm. Once you get them in..start moving right away! I got the Sleepy Wrap and it is GREAT! My new baby is 2 weeks now and she is starting to get colicky too, so I have hauled out my sling and the wrap and put my heavy duty patience on call! My husband also helps out as much as he can in the evenings.     I suggest going to Dr Sears website and checking out his ideas on high needs babies and fussy babies as well. I have had many great ideas from his books.    As for the rash..that may be an allergy to fabric softener or laundry soap..try dye free and fragrance free maybe? Also baby may have had a fever at some point, you may have missed it and has the rash as a result of it.    Lastly I would suggest getting baby to a chiropractor that specializes in infants, especially colic. It can make a world of difference! Good Luck and don't despair! This wont last forever!!!|`|d9f63360c00901d3fe28d35b4e974c71aa	A sick child is a fussy child. There is one universal remedy though. Hold and rock... alot...

But there is no way that you can have another child, sorry. Think about surrogacy or adoption if you want another one, there are so many children out there looking for loving homes|`|dgRTkccBaa	It's not wrong of you to feel that way, but if you had a hysterectomy there is no way for you to be able to carry a baby.  Eventually you will need to come to terms with that fact.  If it's been a year and you're stil feeling bad you might want to consider seeing a therapist who can help you to work through some of your feelings.|`|eya1WDS4aa	No i dont think so.|`|bOxlw3ZHaa	Hi Elizabeth and no there is nothing wrong with you, But to be honest there isn't a way where you can have another baby, I don't know exactly what your going through but to be honest I could imagine how hard it will be knowing that you can't, Sorry to hear about that.....

But otherwise your fine.      Some women get their normal period throughout their entire pregnancy.|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Sounds like the mucous plug. You still have awhile to go so I would suggest calling the dr to be safe. If you've had sex or an internal exam within the last day or two in may just e from that, but better safe than sorry.

mBXu5G5saa	I could tell you are a freshman, this is not a mistake, you are in school, the teacher had every right to take your phone away, as a student, you have to be responsible, you cannot get caught up in something like that because when you are ready to graduate all of this will be on your records and that is the last thing you want. i was once in high school, so there aren't any excuses, Learn from your mistake, because your parent will probably have to pay a fee to get the phone back (the is a law in most high schools) the first time you are given a warning, the second time it's a wrap so go to detention and learn from it!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	your school had every right to take it [i know it sucks]. youre just going to have to get your dad to go up there and get it. =[|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	My sister also recently recieved an administrative referral for refusing to hand over her cell phone. A teacher accused her of "engaging to text" after she put her hand in her purse for a pen. My mother made a very angry phone call to the school and reamed them out for it. Lawfully, a school has no right to take and hold a student's property for an extended period of time, until the end of class, yes... until the end of the week, no. It might help if your dad went in there angry with the school for abusing their position. See if other parents would join him. Taking away a student's cell is dangerous, most people have them because that's the only way they have to let their parents know where they are when they will be home or if they are trouble. However, you need to use your phone responsibly, too. This means, keeping it off or silent if it's important that you recieve messages right away (like you need a kidney transplant) during school hours and keep it in your pocket or book bag. Don't allow friends to use it in class, you know the rules and are old enough to follow them.|`|PiPAIs31aa	You should not bring your phone to class, and if you do at least make sure it's on silent. My school has the same rules, I just turn my phone on silent and don't bring it if there will be a test.|`|xcPghcw9aa	school is for learning. not to be reciving text messages|`|FiUprYsvaa	Just ask your dad if he could pick it up.

xS5Uqgnuaa	Well rikki denied rebekah, then so did vikki, and they both chose trevor. In the end, trevor picked vikki, and rikki was left with no one. after rikki went up to trevor and said "I hope you more honest with her then you are with me" (when trevor told rikki he loved her) vikki made him explain what rikki was saying but all in all, they are still together.  if you get a chance, watch it, it was so good!|`|dlTdrokfaa	tell me what this has to do with babies|`|AA10145416	wrong category
d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	Wow, that is ridiculous. Nobody causes their own miscarriage. That was so insensitive of him and he does NOT deserve to be a father. Not until he grows up at least.     I would feel hurt and very upset, like I am sure you feel now. I don't want to sound mean or cold hearted but I'd be glad things ended how they did with him. He doesn't sound like someone I would want a child with. Actually...he does sound like the person I have a child with but that's a different story. (My son's dad asked me why I didn't have an abortion...mind you this is when our son was FOUR years old! Men can be so disrespectful!)    Something like that is hard to just brush off but just remember you're happy where you are and focus on your current relationship. Good luck hun.|`|G7EUr6kCaa	he is a troll, and should be sterilized! he probably has a genetic defect in his sperm, you tell him that, what a loser thank God you aren't with that b***ard and more!|`|ONQpHeycaa	Oh my god, what a jerk!!!  How dare he say that to you!!!    You know, I went through a miscarriage a few months ago, and I still have not gotten over the guilt of feeling as though it's my fault.  I don't think that will ever go away, but we both need to understand that it WASN'T our fault.  The guilt is something we'll feel, but that doesn't mean we can't accept the fact that we didn't do it on purpose.  I'm sorry that jerk made you feel this way, but it wasn't your fault.  Our babies weren't meant to be born in the situations we were in, and we will have our chance again when the time is right.  Please don't feel discouraged, if you and your current boyfriend have talked about kids in the future, this is a good sign that he is a good man, and he's excited about raising kids with you.  Good luck, and ignore what that a**hole said.  I would suggest no further contact with him whatsoever...that's just plain mean.  I'm glad you found someone better, and good luck with all of your future kids :)|`|eya1WDS4aa	He is such a jerk. No plenty of things can cause a mc it wasn't you. And frankly get a new phone number so he cant contact you he is apparently jealous because you have a b/f and that you have a better life then he does. Screw him.|`|004852a905529110fe5b732be4895189aa	I think you should go back and beat the crap outta him for implying you murdered your child.  I'd be glad he was out of my life, and probably never speak to him again.  Either he's really stupid, or he has some big issues.  Anyways, he's your past. You should move on.|`|Ax5mw8dVaa	Wow I don't know if you would consider this a rude answer, but that guys a d-bag. And nothing was your fault I know plenty of wemon who have miscarried and are now happily pregnant. And out of the danger zone. I think that guy has something wrong with him. But there is nothing wrong with you. Miscarriages are VERY common actually a lot of wemon have them and don't even know it (they didn't know they were pregnant) and stress can cause miscarrages so maybe it was his fault. So smile and just put him behind you and be happy with your current boyfriend. :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	ignore him ( easier said than done) be glad you're not with him|`|QVg9KB1vaa	It's not your fault that you had a miscarriage.  Your ex sounds like an a**hole.  I'm glad you are no longer with that jerk.|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	Don't worry about it. I miscarried on 05/17/08. My brother in law came over that day and told me it was the best thing that could've happened to me. If I wasn't so sick from the pain meds that I had a reaction too, I would have beat the crap out of him. He knows never to bring up anything that has to do with children around me now, lets just say.
PYSMK0JBaa	I would rather see a child adopted by a loving gay couple than left in foster care or an orphanage.|`|bc5jGZ0uaa	Kids deserve loving parents, so what if they happen to be the same gender.  At least they will be able to raise a more open minded child than you I guess.|`|EgKR721maa	it doesnt bother me at all. i mean, if the child is happy and health and loves his parents than its fine. but why leave a child in a foster home where they are not loved.|`|FgVvTnyOaa	I love Jesus and try to abide by His example.. and I know what the Bible says about homosexuality. But honestly, I do not see why a gay couple should not be able to have children! They know love, they know how to raise a respectable member of society. For Christians to say that gays should not be parents is very narrow. There are worse parents out there who claim to be the typical nuclear family, but would do more damage to a child's development than a gay couple would.  Being gay does not make you an unfit person or potential parent, it is ignorant to think otherwise.|`|s5Tg2M4paa	baby i dont care|`|0Id85yiYaa	i think it's discriminatory to put a ban on gays not being able to adopt. it's much better for a "child's mind to be played with" than living in a shelter or going from foster family to foster family.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	I'd be fine if they would allow it.  Then I might get a new niece or nephew!!  I don't think it will be an issue in relation to the mother/father thing these days.  Most schools now teach about all families being different.  My kids both have an uncle who is gay, and living with his partner, and none of them think twice about it.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I see nothing wrong with it. They will get the love they deserve and there's nothing wrong with diversity. It's becoming more commonplace these days so it shouldn't really pose much of an issue.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I think we`ve come along ways as far as our society`s idea of what a family is supposed to look like. A loving household is all that is needed in my eyes. I agree with the other poster, I`d rather see love and compassion, than see a child waste away with no true home and belonging.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	as long as any person is not having sex with the child, the sexual orientation is irrelevant to parenthood.|`|r39EDGhPaa	How will it play with the childs mind?  Once the child starts middle or high school, they will encounter tons of gay people and if they are brought up to think negatively of them, they won't go very far.    And if they are adopted by a gay couple, they won't think that "mommy and daddy" is the norm.  I have a friend with a lesbian mom, and he is perfectly fine.
LHOXXHMnaa	I was usuing pre-seed for almost a month and nothing.I used the clomid by itself and my 1st month I was pregnant.
r39EDGhPaa	I'm sorry that happened to you.  I know what it feels like :(  I had bunnies once, and my cousin left them in their cage outside IN THE SUMMER, and they overheated. I came home, asked if I could feed them, and they were dead.  I had another bunny that had a huge tumor on his face.. he died, and I found him there.  I swear it was one of the most horrible moments of my life.    Anyway, you could get a chinchilla.  They're adorable.  http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll177...    Or a ferret.

dTLTNZTzaa	I use Similac since day one (did not breastfeed my baby at all - did not have any milk).  She was doing great on it (we used Similac Advance), but we had to switch her to Similac Alimentum (she was getting gas and sometimes constipated from Similac Advanced).   She loves it and we do not have any problems right now. And that is the best part.  If your baby has no problems with his formula - do not switch. Do you know how many mothers wish their babies were doing fine with formula from very beginning? My friend switched 12 formulas before they found right one. So consider yourself lucky (I definitely am).  As for your MIL  - tell her that this formula is good for your son and explain to her why. Also you can tell her that it was advised by your doctor not to switch him for the same reasons (gains weight normally, is not gassy or constipated).  And, please, do not feel like bad mom - you are not. You are great mom, since you know what your baby needs. Your baby does great being on Similac? Than be it! That's all what matters.   And also you can tell your MIL - you tried it - and your son hates it (that is what I tell my parents when they start bugging about things I do not agree with) - what kind of grandmother would want to do experiments on her grandchild to prove you are not telling the truth????? lol  Good luck|`|iUMrd7qlaa	Similac is a good kind, i have never tried Good smart but im sure it is good too.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Its my son and he is doing great on similac and im not gonna switch him when he is doing great on one. If the similac bothers him at any point then i will change him but for now its fine. thats what i would tell her.|`|b6cuytMyaa	i think similic is fine :)  & it seem like more people use that, so it's probably better.  good luck & hope this helped!|`|k4r4LJG2aa	If he's on Similac now and is doing well on Similac than you should leave him on that formula.  Basically if a baby is doing well with no problems on a certain formula then leave him on it.  Good Start is a good formula as well, but why change something that's not broken, ya know?  You could be in my shoes.  My 10 week old has been on 5 different formulas and we STILL haven't found the right one for him yet. So like I said, if your son is doing well on Similac, leave him on it.|`|AA11625299	tell her she raised your husband and she did what she thought was best for him, now let you do that for your son, plus unless there is an issue you shouldnt be switching formulas it can cause problems...like constipation, gas, spitting up, fussiness...and if you are having any problems with what he is on there is no reason to switch him!!!|`|v3YJq4moaa	Hello,    I used similac at first and it did not agree with my daughter. I then switched to Good start until she was 6 months old and then went on to Generic from costco. Before 6 months their Digestive system is under developed. Good start breaks down the milk protein so it is not whole like it is in other formulas like similac. The Broken down milk protein makes  digestion easier in babies with sensitive digestion like my daughter. After 6 months she was fine and I switched to generic. all this was done with the help of her pediatrician and I learned a lot. In my opinion I would not switch your baby because he seems to be just fine with similac. Trust me you would know if he was having a hard time with digestions and it sounds like he is doing great!|`|5IK1kQcSaa	You are the mommy....not her.  You do what you feel is best for your baby and for that matter... my son is on similac and has been since he was about 2 months old (had to stop breastfeeding too) and he is now 5 months old and happy as ever:)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	always blame it on doc; doc said since he is doing so well on similac that i shouldn't change him at this point...that should back her off if she is truly nice as you say she is...|`|Grmsgziaaa	If he is doing fine, dont take it off. Tell her to shut up and that he is just fine, and it is bad to change formula anyways, it hurts your babies tummy. Gosh MILs are so annoying arent they? And your a great mom even if you could not breastfeed.    By the way I use Similac and its great.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Tell her that your baby is doing fine, what more does she want? My baby is on the generic from Walgreen's, or regular similac. Whichever one is on sell.|`|QvrhmdAtaa	I would go with the Similac but if you really can,buy goat milk,it's the closest to breast milk there is. When I was 9,I was extremely malnutritioned and was put on goat milk for nearly 5 years. I've had 5 children and am 45 now and my doc just got back my bone scan results a few months ago.He says that I have the bone density of a young child and can't believe how strong they are. I definitely have to give the credit to goat milk,my doc does to. It's sold in most stores in the dairy section but can be a bit spendy. Good luck and I hope I could be of some help to you.I would also tell Grandma that she is a great help and always appreciated but that you've made up your mind and thats that.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Just tell her that she has raised her kids and you would appreciate it if she let you raise yours. You appreciate her help and will be sure to come to her if you are unsure about something. But you are sure that he likes Similac and that it does work well for him. So while your appreciate her trying to help to just let you be mommy and provide for your son!
047dd891d3b2f95a8772081d47f8d49caa	I would just make the best of it.  You won't have to go forever, and you might actually like having someone to bounce your thoughts and feelings off of that won't judge you at all, or give up your secrets like sometimes friends can do.
bMDprymgaa	Some newborns dont poo for a whole week...Its very normal.. My sister has a newborn and we were concerned to but the doctor said its fine|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Hey hun,  It's normal for breastfed babies to do  2 less than formula fed babies, so try not to worry too much. Can you ring your midwife? Or maybe NHS direct to get some advice :) xxx|`|7C9Ett7Caa	My friend took her newborn to the hospital because he hadnt pooped for a week.. They said it was normal and nothing to worry about. They said for her to bring him back if, when he did go poo, if was hard stool or crumbly. So shes fine. Congrats on the new baby!!|`|Xi20QZfMaa	yes you should you need to take it to the doctors|`|vJEatJFPaa	Contact your Peditrician. They might want to observe your baby to make sure all of her systems are working right.    Is she breast or formula fed? If your using formula, you might need a more gentle brand.|`|nFetwOQGaa	you might want to call her doctor just to make sure its ok but i gave my son 2oz of water mixed with 1tsp of karo syrup and he went within 20 minutes! He was a few months old though...I wouldn't worry too much unless she goes more than 3days without pooping...Then you might want to see what else the doctor can suggest...If the syrup doesn't work than they suggest laying the baby down on her belly and putting vaseline on the tip of the thermometer and sticking it just a little bit in her bottom--only the metal part, maybe 1/2 inch...its supposed to help too..i'm sure she will be fine though. Congrats!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	You have every right to worry - infrequent/difficult bowel function is a root cause of most major and minor illnesses!   My usual answer: give her another 48 hours (tops) - then if she still hasn't done, put a baby size suppository in her (a glycerine suppository, aka a "jelly-bomber" - "pop in a jelly if she can't do a smelly!")|`|rftEZA50aa	She'll be fine.

She will go when she has too, she will be fine|`|HHUSNn7iaa	I don't want to worry you, but please get your baby checked out asap. My son didn't poo for his first 36 hours and the midwife told us to take him to hospital, I'm so glad we did because it turned out that he had hirschsprungs disease. (no, we'd never heard of it either!) Basically, he ended up in great ormand street hospital for a week, then he had to come home and get stronger so that he could have part of his bowel removed (the part that wasn't ushing the poo along) when he was 9 weeks old. He's nearly 3 now, and he's absoloutlely perfect and healthy, but I'll always be soooo greatful to the midwife who insisted we took him back to the hospital. Aparently a lot of babies with the same disease my son has do start off with normal bowel movements, and then develope problems after a couple of days.      Sorry, like i said, i don't want to worry you, and in the vast majority of these cases it's nothing to be concerned about, but please get your little one checked out. Good luck! x x x x|`|ifUB8Zziaa	my mum has had four kids, i have a 7 month old little girl and when she was very little she got a little constipated too.. my mum showed me get both legs and bed them up to her stomach then massage the two glands on either side of her bum hole ( this sounds gross and its not a joke) it really works it will just shoot right out hahaha honestly i didn't believe it either but it does work pretty quick too|`|RyYWzEZcaa	if she's fomula fed they tend to go less often and sometimes get constipated because of the iron.  I would give the doc a call just to be sure, he might recommend using a rectal thermometer with vaseline to get things moving, or maybe just adding a little brown sugar to water to help thin things out.

6Knhikr1aa	China has taken their responsibility? China aborts baby girls quite often because of their one baby rule, because everyone wants a boy to carry on their name. If this was implimented everywhere and kept going in that manner, there would be no females and humanity would end. People have basic human rights. Reproduction is one of them. Do you want to live in a world where your basic human rights are taken away from you? Imagine which rights might be next to go...|`|6YvkP2sGaa	I agree.  Though I think one is enough, and the rest can be adopted children or foster kids.    The only thing worse than not being able to have kids is being an unwanted child.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Yes, CHina has taken their responsibility alright - by aborting female fetuses. They now have more men than women - I'm not sure how many societies can continue to function that way. In no way shape or form should we adopt China's policies on two children households (actually, it's only one, FWIW). Read here:    "Sex-selective infanticide appears to occur infrequently in China today. However, there is a strong imbalance in sex ratios in China, which has commonly been attributed to sex-selective abortion. In addition, there appears to be some sex-selective abandonment of infants to circumvent China's one child policy."    That means, basically, that if parents couldn't determine the sex of their child via ultrasound, they resulted to desperate measures - killing their own child - as a result. It is imperative to understand how females are valued in Chinese history - not very highly, in other words. While times have changed somewhat, obviously they haven't a whole lot of an entire society sees killing a child just based on sex to be an acceptable practice.     Our society has already made the two child family the norm - look at the number of couples with only two kids. If you're that big on the environment, look at the number of 'earth friendly' cars that only seat four people. Not much room for five or more, let alone all the gear that comes with kids. We're already a 2-kid society, for the most part. It's a mindset that overall is very difficult to come out of, especially when people hear about those who have more kids than they do.     I think rather than forcefully encouraging people to adopt instead of have their own kids, that perhaps we should encourage those people inclined to abandon or mistreat their children to be better parents! Why should I be punished, in essence, and not allowed to grow a baby, because of someone else's bad parenting choices? That makes no sense. If I'm a good parent, I can easily parent my own kids and take care of them, then what difference does it make? If I"m teaching my kid well and how to be a responsible citizen, then how is this not making a positive impact?    And who's to say the next generation of kids raised in large families aren't being 'environmentally conscious,' and aware of their surroundings, in that sense? Why should they not exist, just because they are seen as 'too many' in the eyes of some? THey stand to leave just as much of a positive impact on this planet as a family with only two kids.     And lastly, I can't think of anything more detestable than someone trying to dictate my fertility or guilt me into not having more children, as long as I can be a loving parent towards them and provide their needs fully. Who are you to say how many kids a person should have? And what happens with accidental pregnancies, birth control failure, etc.? That opens up a whole new can of worms.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	I agree.  Maybe 3 though.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I think there is no possible way to do this ... and no need to do this.    In western societies, overpopulation is NOT a problem.  The average family size is already less than 2 chidren per couple, and the tiny percentage of couples who have large families are more than balanced out by the number thta have one child ... or none at all.  The great majority of population growth today is in the third world, where decreases in infant mortality have not yet been accompanied by decreaes in child-bearing.     Second, there is no way for a FREE society to implement such a policy. (Hint -- China is NOT a free society.)  How would you do it?  Force women to use birth control? Force them to have abortions?  Force them to give up 'excess children' for adoption? (Maybe by those other families that 'want' more than 2?')  The only possible way to achieve such a policy in a free society would be to heavily fine parents who have more children -- and that leads, of course to a whole new group of issues ...like  forcing families into poverty.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I don't want any type of govt in my uterus.  its not their job to decide.  its mine.  no way no how would i ever support that type of legislation.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Once again...more proof of the general public's willingness to allow the government to control our everyday lives.

Even if we don't approve of how or why other people choose to have x number of kids, doesn't give us the right to take away one of their rights as human beings.    If it is as serious as some think it is, then mother nature will eventually put our species back in check.  Remember, she is very effecient at unleashing a variety of "population control" methods when necessary.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i agree with you and i am sure that wil piss ppl off I think after 2 (unless multi births or adoption then you dont get a tax credit for the extra kids|`|GAMypxIFaa	I agree although I guess if you think that way then you would also agree with the fact that there are many female babies killed in China in order for their  family name to carry and having boys are more convenient for work?     I am having my first baby in the next few weeks and i plan on having one more because i had siblings and i love them and wouldn't have wanted to grow up any other way.     I think that the woman out there who go and have the in vitro thing done and have 2 to 8 kids at a time but abort the babies who have something wrong with them within the first three months and then try again until they can get an embryo to stick should apt for adoption, they may seem really mean but i find it odd how many woman have multiple births after getting the in vitro done, doesn't seem right.|`|NI8D46J0aa	Wow, remind me never to move to a place where you're in charge of the population. Seriously though. I am thankful that I live in America where I am free, and where I can have as many kids as I want. I am having my 5th, yes 5th child in August.  I take care of every one of my children. I am not on public assistance, I pay my bills, I dress and feed and love my kids. And I am fortunate enough to be able to stay home and raise them myself. That said, why should I be limited to 2 when I have enough love for 5.  I don't want to adopt, either. I am also fortunate enough to be able to have my own.  If you would have everyone adopt, do you know what that costs? It's a rip off.  I'll take things the way they are, thanks.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I do think that having children is a human right, but I think part of your "problem" could be solved by reducing unplanned pregnancies and especially teen pregnancies.  If you spend any time at all on this site, you'll see that plenty of 13+ girls are freaking out because they are pregnant.  If we get good education and contraceptives out to the girls and women who need it, I think your population "problem" will get better.  I'm very sad that in this day and age with all the options to prevent pregnancy, that so many girls make poor choices and fall pregnant.  Margaret Sanger would be devistated to know that after all her hard work to make birth control legal, that so many people choose not to learn about it or use it properly.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	This has a term that is known as "zero population control". I think without making it a harsh law it could just be taught to educate people. Some people are just not going to care and will either never have children or go on to have 12. So many people don't believe in birth control, abortion, or adoption that is would be hard to enforce this "policy". The only thing we can do is educate ourselves and try to make good decisions concerning the future of both this planet and our children.|`|cJ1RpqY2aa	I agree that our world is becoming overpopulated.  but, isn't it supposed to be a free-world?|`|VEnVl264aa	I think that is wrong!
5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	mine is 12 weeks and has hair on her ears, forehead, arms, legs ahhhh a cute little monkey LOL  i am still waiting for it to fall off!!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	My son was born hairy too lol, he had hair on his upper arms and upper back...and a little on his ears.  It fell off before he was 3 months old....he still has a little bit on his ears but the hair on his back and arms completely fell off.  Just give it a little more time, it will fall off.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	yes my daughter had it and after a few months it fell off.|`|rSwce38saa	Hey,    stop worrying about the kid. She will be fine! :)   If there was something wrong, your doc's would have told you by now.|`|FLpMShKNaa	My son was super hairy-he had dark hair all over his back, tiny tushy, arms, legs, ears and had big sideburns-we called him wolverine. It seems like around 2-3 months it gradually fell off, but he now has some very pale downy hair on his back and shoulders.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	My daugther was born 4 weeks premature, and she was born with hair on her upper arms and back, and it all went away by I'd say 2 1/2 or 3 months or so.|`|qLkknQx1aa	my niece was that way for a little while, it falls off after a bit. - it's cute though isn't it?|`|dc628c84ed9b9f2f5bfb75b116f5d31caa	my son was hairy as well up till he was 2 months
V6vAvs0Yaa	Don't worry, my wife does the same thing with our second born.     A few days ago, I caught her complaining that he hadn't napped and thus she was unable to take her shower:    Dad-"So, why not just put him in his pack and play and take a shower."  Mom- "but he's awake!"  Dad-" So what! Your going to be gone what, 10 minutes at most. He's right around the corner"  Mom- "but what if I don't hear him crying"  Dad - "he's not going to explode if you don't get him right away"    Thus we see difference between men and women. Don't hate your husband for it. We all do it. And don't sweat the "my daughter," "our daughter." It's all context and feeling. There isn't all that much psychology behind it.     He's her daughter too.|`|MjashZnvaa	Its sounds like you need to talk to him and let him know how you feel. Ive felt like that plenty, my husband gets involved in other things and kind of blocks out whats going on in the house around him. I think its easier for dads to zone out, us Mommy's are very aware of everything our babies are doing. Just talk to him....|`|aKvxy3xBaa	Lots of new Mothers feel the same way, just remember the baby is BOTH of yours. You husband is not babysitting, he is watching his own child. It gives him a one on one with your baby. Just try to relax and enjoy  your shower or a nice bubble bath. Congrats|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	it's natural for men to be a bit selfish (believe me.. :) i'm a man and i know how we feel).. but..it doesn't say that he doesn't want to get involved in ur daughter's affair and .. the more important thing is.. it really doesn't mean that he doesn't love u anymore..   if u want him to get a little more involved... plz do try telling him wat you think he should do... however..DO NOT TELL (NEVER) in a way that would insult his personal character.. if u do like this.. things will get worse.. DO TELL in a way.. that u r making only suggestion and at the same time.. showing that... u care for him and his feelings..|`|UfYo8Lmlaa	Sweet Julia...reading your words are almost as if I typed them myself when I had my son.  I bet you are feeling very overwhelmed and a bit crazy at times.  Let me assure you that you are not going crazy and it's a combination of hormones, responsibility, change and being a mom.  You carried that baby around for 10 months and now there is that little life looking to you to provide it nourishment, cleanliness, safety...it is alot to take on.  Please consider what I am saying and I promise things will become a bit more normal.  I'm not sure if your husband is supportive or not but you need some time to yourself and to regain your composure.  Start small and go for a five minute walk or go for a drive and do it as often as you can.  You are going to be a way better Mom if you are healthy and refreshed and sane then if you are stressed out and overwhelmed.  Worst case...the baby screams it's head off for 5, 10 or 15 minutes......Dad's need to learn how to comfort and handle their children too.  If it seems to be getting worse as the days go on, see your Dr. about post partum depression.  One more suggestion, one that was a gift from god to me...find a mommy group that gets together to support new mom's and you will soon see that you are going through the same things many women do.  Good luck.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	My fiance is the same way...and my daughter is 5 1/2 months. I have tried to talk to him and things still havent changed. Maybe if you tell him how you feel you will have better luck than me.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Perfectly normal and you sound like a good mom.   Sometimes we worry because we're afraid something will happen when our baby is out of our sight.  I think with time you will learn how to relax when he watches her.       Just your maternal instinct at work...|`|68c6B8dRaa	Normal...|`|eRKIfrVfaa	Tell him you need him to take more respsibillty.I feel the same way wen my older brother wont take care of our younger brother.It all ended wen I told him that.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	lol I do the same thing! Its crazy, I feel quilty even when I make dinner and hes in the living room with my husband. Or if I am at the store and I left him its terrible and he is now 8 months and it hasnt gone away!|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I truly thing this is all in your head. Your husband probably cherishes and looks forward to the time that gets to spend with his little girl one on one.  I think your probably feeling that the mother has to do everything. It could  be a common feeling for a mother with a new baby even more if its your first, since in days gone by the father had very little to do with raising the young ones. Its probably only in the last 30 years or so that dads are taking a big step in sharing the parenting with their wifes or mother of their child.  After carrying the baby for 9months even though the baby has been born you might still feel a little bit uncomfortable and weird when the baby is not with you.     I would talk to your husband about this perhaps you just need to hear him say Honey dont rush take your time, me and baby are going to be fine and enjoy our one on one time together   You should be able to enjoy your time with out the baby, just as your husband should be able to enjoy his one on one time with the baby.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	You may feel more relaxed as your daughter gets older. I used to be the same way, but now I take my time when I have a break to take a shower or do something around the house while my husband watches our 9 month old. I still do feel rushed sometimes, but not as much as in the beginning.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	He's cruel you have a life also...tell him how you feel|`|dcd11iUwaa	jesus Julia. chill out and relax.  shes not going anywhere.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	i would send them on a father daughter day, have them do something together, like go to the park, walk around, maybe go to the zoo if you have one close. then spend the day to your self. or have some friends over. take a nap, a long hot bubble bath... pamper your self get some you time|`|nYI8eB0Baa	My husband is the same way and it has been going on for 8 months!|`|kMbwD8WZaa	OMG !!!!    Please...read this !!!!!           OK. I know EXACTLY how you feel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My kids are 2 and 4 and I'm JUST NOW feeling like my husband should share in the responsibility.  But I still do stuff like feeling rushed in the shower, or feeling bad for leaving to make a quick store run, ect ect.    I even make myself WAIT until the kids are in bed before I'll go to wal-mart and leave them with my husband.        I also feel like I never can relax in the shower...I'm ALWAYS rushed even though my husband is here.       I'm so sorry I don't know what to tell you....other than talk to your husband about the way you feel.   I try to...but it seems to not work.  I'm pretty sure its just a "motherly feeling".  And its not a BAD feeling...it just shows that you care about your children.         I wish you the best...and don't feel alone.  Until I read what you wrote...i felt alone...|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I feel this way at times.  I am never relaxed and always in a rush to get back to my son. Not because my husband is rushing me just because I am worried my son needs me. He will scream at times with his dad and wont be comforted til I hold him. I cant stand thinking of him screaming for me and me not being there.|`|rNdun1V7aa	i don't think it's your husband, after I had my son I didn't feel relaxed, ever. my sister would come to watch him so I could get some sleep and i felt this bizarre guilt feeling that I should be with him, and that i shouldn't be sleeping. I cannot describe it. i just thought it was the whole connection thing since we carried them for so long. it's really weird but it passes.|`|nFetwOQGaa	I'm kind of the same way with my son. I think its just a mommy thing...we feel like we need to be there to make sure everything is ok. It's probably not even something your hubby is doing wrong, you just need that reassurance. Try to trust him more and watch how he interacts with her--maybe it will show you that he can do the job just fine..it might not be exactly the way we do it (i'm way more careful with my baby than my hubby is) but as long as she is taken care of you need to try to relax. Its important for you to have time to yourself! It will probably get better as she gets older...goodluck!|`|br0BbJfcaa	tell him how you feel. take your time to look after yourself to.|`|ZkrPKdqwaa	I don't think your husband doesn't want to do anywork,  i think its that you don't think that he can or wants to|`|I5SypMlsaa	so you dont trust him witht the baby? is there a reason...|`|1eWDadlFaa	Sounds like normal new-mom syndrome to me. Enjoy, it will get easier.|`|JZNIyClNaa	This is normal - you need to allow yourself the room to make mistakes, even with a child.  If she is to grow up normal and healthy, you need to stop hovering around her.|`|x0bJmyDPaa	I think most new mothers feel this way - I know I did.  Thing is, unless your husband is honestly making you feel this way, then it's probably just that you feel it's your job to be taking care of the baby and that's why you feel rushed to get back to her.  It takes quite a while to get used to being a mother and realise that you won't now have a lot of spare time to just relax the way you could before your baby arrived.|`|QkUPftjnaa	tell him how u feel ......try showing him what u wrote..|`|OGV3NtYSaa	You should talk to him about how you feel. It will make you feel better to tell him.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	I think that's normal.  It takes time to trust, even those you love, with some new little precious person that's been only in your care all this time (pregnancy included).    Let him handle the baby more when you *are* around.  This way, you can feel more comfortable leaving her with him when you can't make sure he'll take good enough care of her.|`|zJ282m3naa	don't care about what you feel , just take longer showers and let your husband feel a little responsible... and tell him you are the fatherjust remind him from time to time that he is the father as well as you are the mother.
aaZ0cTdCaa	If it is like a "butterfly" or "flutter" feeling, then yes, it could definitly be fetal movement. Most women don't feel anything until a couple weeks later.     Congrats!|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Maybe its just rapidly growing, I'm sorry!|`|yjhpBM11aa	Sure you can.. I started feeling my baby move at 14 weeks. They didn't feel like flutters as some people describe it. They felt like little movements. Congratulations!  :)
r39EDGhPaa	Nothing that she has done is any worse than the majority of the teens on here, actually.     She's taken a few racy pictures.. so have tons of girls.  And the Asian eye thing, wasn't bad.  5 other people were in that picture, including an Asian.  What makes her any worse than the rest of them?    It wouldn't matter to anyone if it were normal people doing these things.  No one on here calls each other whores for doing things way worse than what Miley has done.  She's a teenage girl, just like the lot of us on here.  She's just in the spotlight, so every single photo she is in becomes publicized and somehow turns into an offensive picture.    http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/02/asian-grou...  what is wrong with that?  I think that all of the people who are making a big deal out of that picture are bored and need to get out more.    edit: OH MY GOD. Are you kidding me?  You are turning this into some huggeee deal.  And as far as those pictures go, they were just pictures.  I bet some of your friends have had sex, or someone you know has had sex.  I doubt you talk about them this way. Get a life, really.  I'm not a fan of her but she has done nothing wrong to anybody.    edit: When I say your friends have probably had sex, I mean that they have done worse than miley has.  Wow she wore a low cut top and took a picture.. who gives a sh*t? lmao I'm done here, you suck at making points.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	who gives a F U C K          PS  Learn how to drive.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	cause shes lame and shes a "role model" for all the 7-15 year olds and needs to not get in troble.|`|KbPrPuvhaa	she's so overrated   ant too full of herself who even likes her?|`|EccBqsntaa	My best friend is part Asian and I think it offended her. It's obvious she doesn't know how to stay out of trouble. Aren't you supposed to LEARN from your mistakes. Not make them over and over again?|`|ipWhwFKYaa	I know where you coming from because i am a non asian but i be mad if somebody made  fun of me cause i was different she proabably end up losing some of her fans. Thenshe act like she does nothing wrong|`|n1mwxljzaa	because she's the biggest slut ever.|`|ZbNCdS8qaa	because apparently she is a role model to kids and the press have some idea that parents are going to show their children pictures of miley cyrus in her underwear. she is just having fun but because she was on a kids tv show, she is NEVER allowed to do anything that most normal teenagers do.|`|tnX7DD9Paa	lol that was funnn but she not racist|`|vp1K0bxwaa	Oh come on, people make those Asian faces all the time, and there is an ASIAN in the picture with them!    People cry racism for EVERYTHING nowadays.|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	I don't think she intended any offense even though some might have been taken. But she should be more careful. It's not jsut Miley, if she did something where racism was actually intended, then I'm sure people wouldn't say "She's just having fun."    Edit: I noticed that in another question you told the person to stop bringing it up then, and that they were immature, but you brought up this question too???  Didn't make sense. (don't take this in offense or anything, just wondering).    PS.  I find it funny how you know about all these Miley pics, like every racy pic she's ever taken. You're all like oh yeah, the shower pic, and ohh that other pic. Funny. People follow everything she does, I don't see what they get out of this.|`|5DCzED6Xaa	Okay   So I'm asian  Do I give a dam?  Nope.  Actually it's sorta funny.  Just because Miley's on a kids show.  "Shes not allowed to have fun or be anormal teenager" because the media is constantly judging her.  God  Take a chill pill  Kthanks

Just the way she is!)|`|v0GwTTsVaa	All of these questions depend on the child.  Children start walking at different ages....anywhere from 8 months up.  Most of them are walking around 12 months, but I have known a few that didn't walk until 13/14 months.  Some children sleep through the night........some may wake a time or two.  Most of them do take at least one nap during the day.  A good two hour nap once a day...usually after lunch is normal.  But it really depends on the child....they all develop differently.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	2naps hr in da morning and 2hrs in the avo  7pm till 630am  yes  bout 11kg|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	my thirteen month old sleeps from about 8:30 - 9:00 till around 7 or 7:30 in the morning then he goes back for a nap sometime between 10 and 12 for anywhere between 1 hour to 3 hours depending on when he woke up and what time he fell asleep for his nap...    yes his nightime sleep is always uninterupted and he weighs somewhere around 21 or so lbs|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	My son is almost 13 months and he goes for his morning nap at 10am up by about 11-11:30 then naps at about 2-3:30 4, then sleeps 8pm-8am, he is a very active boy and weighs 24lbs and not walking yet, he can but just chooses not to. :)|`|gqWyki24aa	my 13 month old naps 2 times  a day.  they are between 1 hour and 2 hours. and sometimes she dosnt want to take her afternoon nap.  at night she sleeps usually 12 hours and mostly dosnt wake unless not feeling well or something.  but on occasion she'll wake a couple times a night..but not normally.  she walks...since 11 months.  she is 21 lbs.

Let him knock over the towers you build, he will probably love that. Also, as you build, name the colors of blocks. If you have wooden blocks, you can do colors and shapes.   If the weather is nice, take him outside and run around. This will help with the energy level. Buy, or even build, a safe place for him to climb, like a little slide. You can do that indoors with pillows. Just pile them up and let him climb all over them. When making dinner, give him bowl and spoons to play with so he can "cook" with you. He may make a lot of noise, but that's how they learn.|`|ULL3oIOeaa	8-9 breakfast     9-10 playing stickers     10-11:45 park    11:45-12:20 lunch    12:20-1:05 nap    1:05-2 more play    3-4 snack    4-5 painting    5-7 grandma`s house    8:45 bedtime|`|FkPP6NVeaa	Read him a book!

VKgD1K3baa	My son is also 5 months old. I am still breastfeeding, but also pump so daddy can help out. i tried the Sassy MAM bottles, but he didn't care for them. I also tried the Avent, but what he likes is the playtex nursers with the drop in bags. Every baby is different. Just buy one of each and see which one she likes best. Best of luck to you!|`|MtrvRNj9aa	I absolutely love them, however the nipple for the bottle is shaped completely different than the nipple on the pacifier. They are great bottles though. The vents work great and I must say they never leaked for me which I read a lot of other people had problems with. They definitely helped with my son's gas. I would recommend those over anything else.
7C9Ett7Caa	I definatly would save them...Nothing wrong with that..|`|vJEatJFPaa	Thats completely up to you. If there still in good tact then why not? Im all about saving $.    Even brand new bottles aren't 100% sterile anyways. If you've cleaned them and there in good shape keep em'.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I'd keep them.  It would be such a waste to throw those out just to buy new ones.  Just boil them again when you're ready.  Congrats on the new little one!!
cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Once she passes out she will start breathing again. just make sure there is nothing around her that she could hurt herself on if she does pass out (like chairs, tables, etc). Probably after passing out once or twice she will realize what the results of holding her breath are and won't do it anymore. This is very common among young children. I wouldn't worry too much. If you want reassurance, though, ask your pediatrician.    Edit: Passing out will not harm her (as long as she doesn't hit her head or anything else on something when she falls). Her brain would need to be without oxygen for longer than it takes for her to pass out (and subsequently start breathing again). She should suffer no long term effects.|`|dShnJ20raa	She will be fine. The worst that will happen is she will pass out which is just her bodies way of telling her to start breathing again. My little brother used to do it all the time and apparently when my grandpa was that age he did it too. Most of the time it is just to get your attention or because she is really upset. She will grow out of it eventually|`|PrxlHUT5aa	turning blue means she isn't getting much oxygen in her body to begin with, regardless if she holds her breath or not.  she might have a congenital problem... best if you check with a specialist if your current pediatrician doesn't do anything about it...might be cyanosis.  either way it would be best to know coz early intervention is key in keeping our health.    Quote:  "If your child becomes blue with crying, during feeding, or at other times, you should comfort your baby by picking him or her up and pulling the knees up to the chest. This will help blood get to the lungs more easily. If your child does not regain colour quickly after comfort and pulling the  knees up, or if the baby becomes weak or limp with crying call an ambulance immediately..."|`|rHufcHwHaa	This is a more common two-year-old behavior than you'd think.  The worst that will happen is that she will pass out, and then immediately start breathing again.  It's comforting to know that she will not be capable of killing herself.  What you can do is lay her down, or put her in a place where she will not hurt herself if she falls, and then quietly leave the room.  She'll get the idea that it is not acceptable behavior under any circumstance, and she'll probably stop doing it.|`|eyQBvbzraa	lots of kids do this and good news mom, when she passes out she will breath again.she will outgrow it.|`|AlV10Equaa	see a pro doctor   duh
kf7XLE8kaa	It's easier to say that people are racist or spoiled, or self-centered, than it is to look at the real issues.  It's easier to ignore what people are actually saying than it is to delve into the reality of the situation, especially for those who have adopted and *might* have brought home a child who should never have been adopted in the first place.  Who wants to know that they benefitted from someone else's devastating loss?  That's a difficult thing to come to terms with.  No matter how much the children deserve that honesty, it's just too tough for some to go there after they've already brought their child home.    ETA:  The "racist" label doesn't really fit me, either, because I'm about as Heinz 57 as they come.  I'm a little bit of everything.  What do I have to be racist against?|`|TTS9cvUmaa	"Americans who disagree with international adoption are "spoiled" and "racist"?  No ONLY THOSE who 1) give advise,pass comments about a country they know zero about.   2) Also they club ALL International adoptions as un-ethical based on reports from a few countries like Guatamala. They do nothing to address each country on a "specific" basis. Like assumption that all brown people are- Paki (an insulting way of calling out to a brown person) . The brown could be Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian,Guatamalan, Chilean, Mexican, etc.  3) "Assume" every question is about International adoption if it speaks of a country other than their own. I am amused when i read an Indian ask about adoption and she was advised to have "good old fashioned American baby the natural way".Like the world starts and ends with AMERICA !!  I gave her all Indian info ....got ONLY TD's and my answer was picked by her as the best and an e-mail telling me she couldn't believe people in the West had such "tunnel vision" to think she was American.    4) Laughing at a questioner on yahoo's spelling or English and assuming they ought to be fluent in English irrespective of which part of the world they are writing in from. (I Just recieved a e-mail on this from someone)  Its highly arrogant and not just "spoiled".    Its like an Indian who has never stepped on a Western soil tells an American "maybe you should stop having sex with countless people. Have morals . Then you won't get AIDS".( A presumption by many Indians in India about the Westerners.....Read a fictional comedy called "Inscrutable Americans- Anurag Mehta,it covers all the biases)" Yes, SOME Indians are biased too.    "India is handing out babies like a bargain basement discount store." ..............LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST attacking an Indian and passing judgemental comments are heights of arrogance and  racism IMO.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Racist, spoiled, not necessarily.    Ignorant.. yes.    Until they go to places like India, etc. and visit the orphanage and find out how many indian families with "indian culture" are or are NOT willing to take these children... until they do that.. they should not pass judgment on IA.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	How does international adoption exploit orphans and encourage poverty? International orphanages are usually not as nice as they are in the states. They are very underprivileged. By adopting a child from there you are giving them a better life. Something they never would have achieved in their own country. International adoption is a great thing. And people are considered "racist" if they dislike someone of a different race, not necessarily their country. And whether or not they are ignorant depends on their reason for not wanting to adopt internationally .|`|zLoyo24Taa	I dont think people who disagree with international adoptions are "spoiled" or "racist" (I do think the race card is used way too much). I feel that a few of the people here who disagree with international adoptions think that every situation is exactly the same situation that is portrayed on the latest news show. They see one infant being taken from a mother in tears and jump to the conclusion that every infant is snatched. Many of the internationally adopted children do well in their new families. I think some people here "cantstop" because they can not control how others think and act.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	I'm not sure.    We adopted internationally. I don't see how it exploits orphans or encourages poverty. How would it do that? We did consider that some sell their kids to be adopted and tried to avoid that. We also considered that there are lots of domestic orphans that could be adopted. There are pros and cons to be weighed.     I'm fine if people disagree with our decisions and don't consider them racist or spoiled though. I imagine that possibly some do.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I won't restrict my answers to Americans or say that they are racist, spoiled or ignorant.  The issues are not restricted to any one group of citizens.      I do think though that those who are against international adoptions from the stand point that "we have orphans of our own that need help first" are very short sighted and closed minded on the subject.  Many of these countries that have children available for international adoption are not able to care for the children themselves either due to their economics or the lack of available services for the children.  There are also cultural factors at play whereby adoptions are not encouraged or undertaken for many reasons.      Yes, I know there are problems with international adoption processes in some countries more then others.  Yes, I know the system(s) need to be fixed.  Yes, I know some countries need help with their financial and social issues that may play on the number of children awaiting adoption.  It can't be denied and the issues need to be addressed but that takes plenty of time and the children needing assistance need it now.      (I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would object to helping other countries solve their problems too and we would hear things like "We have homeless and starving people here at home too who need help before we send billions overseas)    While we may live in different countries, speak different languages or have different physical characteristics we also are all citizens of the world and need to ensure that we don't become too isolationist in our thinking.      As far as "the race card" is concerned, I think there are always going to be people who will throw it around and thats part of their opinion and they are entitled to it.  That doesn't mean that you, I or anyone else have to agree or disagree.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Well I'm pretty much against it........    I'll go ask my family which is now comprised of Germans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, French, English,Scottish, Portuguese, Jehovahs, Jews, Christians, 1 born again Christian, Catholics and 1 Baptist if they think I'm racist, ignorant and/or spoiled.    edit...soon Norwegians.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Racist, no.    However, there are many people in industrialized countries (like the US) that really don't have any conception of how good we have it and then yes, I think the term "spoiled (American)" applies.  My trip to Liberia was life changing in more than one way.  I've been to poor areas in the US and Mexico.  I've taken care of patients in the projects, isolated on reservations in the middle of the desert or the prairie and I'll say that none of that prepared me for what I witnessed in a REAL Third World country.    I've worked with many refugees and immigrants here in the US and to a one, they all say that Americans just don't comprehend how most of the rest of the world lives.      So when people unilaterally bash IA without taking into consideration the conditions and futures of many children who don't live in a First or Second World country, yes, I think "spoiled" and I think "ethnocentric" and I think "ignorant".      I just think that anyone who thinks that children are automatically better off in their home culture, even if the conditions are deplorable need to have lived in similar conditions (and be old enough to remember it) before passing judgement.      I also take offense that if my children aren't voicing being angry/traumatized about being here, it's because they are afraid of upsetting me.  You DON'T KNOW my children.  How DARE you presume that you can speak for them!  It's condensending, rude and arrogant.  And for the record, I know just as many adult international adoptees that DON'T experience what others decribe.  Every situation and every individual is unique.  For people who scream blue murder about people speaking for them, some people here have no problem speaking for everyone else.|`|VFifg9FEaa	Not at all.  I have never thought the people here at least are against IA due to racial, ignorant or spoiled reasons.      ITRW there are plenty of people against inter racial families, whether through adoption or biology.  And they are not all Americans either.    I personally think the race card is over used.  People use it too much to try and get others to give in or give them what they want.  It is used to often too manipulate people.  If you disagree with them disagree with their idea not their race.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	No.      The "race card" should be thrown when people adopt internationally. Ap's may say, "Color or race does not matter, our child is our child, we are color bilnd", and all the other nice things they say, but that has NOTHING to do with how their child feels about being different and losing their entire history and culture.      Read some of the blogs written by International Adoptees. Talk to them. As an adoptee, I can tell you that a young child will NOT verbalize their issues with this until they are older and are in touch with themselves and their pain.  They're afraid of hurting their adoptive parents.          http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...      ***eta*** OOPS! I meant that people who are not familiar with the complexities of IA should read some blogs written by IA's, not you,  Isabel. lol.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	Actually I think Americans who disagree with International adoption are neither spoiled or racist especially in the circumstance that those Americans who oppose International adoption (and especially transracial adoption) are actually International Adoptees.    How presumptuous is it of someone to tell an International Adoptee she is racist for opposing IA? That is a completely uneducated and closed minded viewpoint to take.     Most Americans who disagree with IA are educated on the subject. We are opposed to the trafficking of human infants and the idea that people should remove children from their native cultures. We are well versed in the ways that IA and TRA affect children ad have concluded that we are against both because of those emotional effects.     I believe it is spoiled and ignorant to take a light view of international adoption and close your mind to all of it's flaws.    Eta: I did want to add on what Linny said...young children who are adopted do not want to speak out against adoption because often they are brought up to be "grateful" that they were "saved". If you are lead your entire life to believe that you should be grateful to be adopted it can be difficult to share any possibly negative viewpoints with your a parents, the people you are supposed to be grateful for. I also agree with her in saying that a larger emphasis should be placed on race. Saying we should be color blind is a nice thought and a nice idea but in reality life doesn't work that way. The fact that I am racially different from my family and my fiance is not a bad thing. It should be acknowledged instead of dismissed. It is ignorant to dismiss something so obvious.     To those who say that we should be "color blind", what is wrong with being different? What is wrong with admitting to difference in race? There is no difference between admitting to a difference in race and admitting a difference in gender. Those both are self evident facts.     Isn't it odd that most of the people who say that they are colorblind and insist others also do so are people who have not been on the receiving end of racism?|`|9l3qnrUxaa	I think some people think it makes them look better to adopt a baby from a foreign country. Like oh, look how cute my little asian baby is, isnt it great that Im so globally well rounded because I adopted a child from another country. I dont believe that people think about the ramifications of adoptiong internationally, I cant tell you how many adoptive parents I have met that dont have the know how to properly care for a child with a different ethnicity. For example I met a couple who had adopted a child from Africa and refused to take the child to an ethnic hair salon because they said "it was ghetto in those places" So the child sat in the chair at Fantastic Sams getting her hair pulled practically out of her head because the  stylist was trying to do her hair as if she were Caucasian. That might not be the best example but Im sure you can see where Im going with this. Im sure people will get pissed with my answer but it was an opinion you asked for and this is mine.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	No.  Not spoiled or racist.  Like many Americans, though, self-centered is an adjective I'd use.      No one child is better than the other, no matter where they live.  I've heard many people ask why not look in the US first.  I guess to those specific people, American children are in more need of a family or are better in some way.

Tx8JHmDvaa	if she's heavier than you, you should probably be able to RUN!! run away from her. hang out with friends, get a job, volunteer, anything to get you out of the house. if you're not in the house, she can't boss/bully you!! or just ignore her. if that doesn't work, tell your mom to  tell your sister that you are not going to play baby anymore!|`|e1jqOCEUaa	You obviously can't push her around because that would be very wrong, but maybe if you set aside some time to play a game with her (that you both enjoy) every once a week or couple days then she'll lay off you a bit.

You should tell your own Mom and get some more advice, and move on from there.|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	tell your mom or a concealer. but be prepared that if you tell your mom she might not want you to be friends with her,but she is just trying to protect you from making the same mistake. just don't make the same mistake your friend did. wait till you are older, on birth control, well educated about sex, and have been with someone you love for a long time.      good luck!!!|`|nZian6traa	that horrible tell your mom and tell her mom|`|EBkGtGjDaa	well 1. she under age of consent. i say tell an adult    mainly her parents or yous or even a trusted teacher ( someone trusted at school)    save her before she get pregnant or worse an std    just yell it out  " so and so had sex! she told me!"    that would be the fastest way to get it out.    and just to be safe:    MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail?

If you haven't gotten your period yet, or have had it for a while, they might. If your sexually active, they will. If you have already gotten your period it might be time to go to a gynecologist, someone who specializes in that, instead of your regular doctor. Most women do.     Just remember, you can say NO to any part of any medical treatment or test you don't want to do. If your doctor wants to check, and you don't want them to, just say no. They can't force it on you.|`|lTsPX04jaa	yes they are going to|`|AA10755633	i went to my physical and at 13 - 14 and they dont look     if its a male doc ask for a female one!    i havent gottten my period either so who ever said that..no...    and they didnt touch they just take a quick peek *when i was 11*|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	depends on what kind of physical it is.|`|k31jFSd0aa	If you've already gotten your period then they don't, but if you didn't they look but they don't touch.  I always hated those!|`|1CuTF8qOaa	I did mine for school and yes they did.
pzLDXL6gaa	It's an extremely tiny chance if you've taken it right. Higher chance if you've missed pills or done something else wrong.    No, being on the pill won't interfere with the results of a pregnancy test. It just detects hCG and basically only pregnant women have enough of that hormone for the test to pick up, it has nothing to do with the hormones in the pill.     Birth control can cause some similar symptosm to pregnancy. If you are worried, take a pregnancy test.    Harriet|`|MY8jbGxPaa	it IS possible. No birth control is 100% effective.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	It is possible. My son is proof. Being on bc won't affect a pregnancy test, so go ahead and take one.
UH5oCjJTaa	Seems like to me you just need to relax and forget the strict schedules...  Its a good idea to have a routine for your baby such as bedtime rituals and timing but to have a strict time to feed and to play is going a little overboard.  Let your baby's internal body tell you when and what he wants.  He will not let himself starve and he will learn to be more independent.    as far as solids - i would suggest you start trying rice cereal.  I started my daughter on rice cereal at 5 months.  As long as the natural reflex that babies have where they push their tongue out when something is put in their mouth.  Once this reflex is gone you can start solids.  My daughter did not do well with rice cereal because it constipated her a lot so i switched her over to oatmeal cereal shortly after.    just give it a try.  he will let you know if he is not ready.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Any schedule is good-My daughter is 10 months, and she's just starting to get on one.|`|k4r4LJG2aa	Usually from 4-6 months you can start introducing solids to them.  But check with your ped first.  I don't breastfeed, but my dr told me that if he's going to take more and will take more to give him more.  Because my son was wanting a bottle like every 2 hours.  They told me that was ok.  If he wants more and will take it, then do it is what they told me.  You can check the parenting websites as well because they have that information there as well. Babycenter.com is a good one.
HkSZDEqqaa	Stop being a ***** and man up... If you were man enough to **** her you should be man enough to face the consequences...

I don't recommend getting an abortion it can cause depression.|`|weE5FxCfaa	she can't get an abortion without parental consent so someone is going to have to tell parents.  also is she sure she is pregnant? it takes at least 2 weeks from the time of sex until a pregnancy test will come back positive.  are you sure it is yours if she is?  babies have a heart beat at 6 weeks gestation and feel the pain of being aborted so if she is pregnant consider adoption, since she will have to tell her parents either way.|`|JV0i77uiaa	It will hard but you have to talk to their parents and your parent.

The girl hasn't told anyone either so you have some time.    1.  Abortion isn't the answer.  Don't kill your child because you are scared.  You also don't realize the physical and psychological harm an abortion can do.    Here's what you do:  Get the girl and both of you go to the nearest Catholic church and ask if they have Gabriel Project at that church.  They will help the girl and you with what you need.  If you don't want to be a father yet, they will help you with putting up the child for adoption if that is what the child's mother wants.    After you have done that and calmed down a little, tell your parents and have her tell her parents.  Yes mom and dad will freak out at first, but they will calm down and will help you.    Finally, keep your adventures to skateboarding and extreme sports.  You already found that the one adventure you thought would be the best didn't work out that way.|`|zh310sJoaa	LMAO!

Oh, and apologize to her.  My friend got pregnant, and she tells me that the worst you can do is leave the baby.  If your girlfriend is too scared to get an abortion, get ready to be a father.  DO NOT LEAVE THE BABY, OR THE MOTHER.  If you do, both mother and kid will not thank you.  And, don't try to force the abortion.      Another friend I had, never had a father, and did poorly because of it.    Best of luck.  If baby comes into the world, Congrats.    If you become a father:  Don't let your kid drink, smoke, or otherwise.  Be supportive, understanding, and otherwise.  Lastly, don't spoil your kid.    See ya'!

Running away will not solve the issue. If you have parents that are at all understanding, or have ever loved and supported you in the past, man up ( hard for a teen to do) and tell them what is going on. An adult's guidance is really needed here, for you, for the girl, and the baby.    If you cannot go to your parents, can she go to her parents? If neither set of parents are able to listen and help, go to your local planned parenthood office. They have a great set of tools: counselors, medical assistance, pamphlets with TONS of information on the next steps.    Right now, as hard as it may be... this is your child inside of her, but really it is her decision on what to do. All you can do is be supportive of her. If she chooses to give it up for adoption, your job is to deal with it. If she chooses to keep the baby, your job is to learn to be a father!     Go to the girl, be there for her support her how you'd like your parents to support you. Now is your chance to solve the problem you helped to create. Do not let fear back you down.  My best wishes to all involved in this.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Live up to your mistakes. Talk to the girl about what you want to do. Don't even think of getting an abortion until you are calmed down and know what you are doing. Running away will not solve anything. Also tell your parents. Do it face to face though. I'm sure if you speak to them in a mature manner then it will be less painful, hurtful. If you and the girl really don't want to keep the child then think of giving it up for adoption before the abortion.  Also make sure she is not lying to you because some girls just want attention. Go to the doctors with her to get a pregnancy test and go into the doctors room with her while getting the test and look at the results with your own two eyes.  Hope this helps.  Remember to talk to the girl who you had sex with and your parents. Do not run away from this problem.|`|w2vvFmr8aa	Don't listen to everyones bullshit about "get an abortion" or "ddon'tget an abortion." Google it or go to planned parenthood and talk to a representative. After learning about the abortion, THEN make your decision. Don'tlet these fools influence you in a time like this. First of all make sure the child is even yours. Was she sleeping with only you? Chances are slim that if you only had sex once and wore a condom that she is pregnant. Find out who she was sleeping with. If it was only you, have her run another test. The tests are not as accurate right away, the longer you wait the more accurate they become. After another test, if it is still positive, then you and her need to sit down and talk. If you both decide on abortion, then you will need to check your state for it's laws. In Oregon we have to be 18.|`|GJl3COZUaa	Based on what you have said.    If your parents are severe on punishments you need to think about telling them and when to tell them.    I feel your pain. However it is up to her to decide weather in abortion is okay. You are right neither she nor you are ready. You can give the baby for adoption and eventually your parents need to know. Again first talk to her and let your parents know that you wore protection.     Next time before being intimate use a spermicide, condom, and that she is on another form a birth control. Wait until your out of High School. Learn from this and move on. Yes hard times are ahead if she is indeed pregnant. However there are options and choices to be made.|`|TzLxCXm9aa	man you will think about this your whole life, even if you kill your baby it will haunt you for ever...think about adobtion or your folks may suprize you...our 1st baby we were still in high school and my dad was ok my mom slaped me and called me stupid. my husband just came to our house and never went home just waited til his folks heard it through rumors...but we've been married for 12yrs and now have 5boys. so plz think of the options before you jump to abortion. because that baby has a heart beat and feels pain even now.|`|J37DjFVPaa	make sure she definatly is pregnant before you do anything like she has done a test and hasnt just skipped a period.  Abortion is a huge thing and although you may want to do it because your scared, her being pregnant will be a heap more scary for her as its her body. you cant force her to get an abortion, it has to be a joint decision. As this can lead to huge emotional problems down the track.  plus i recommend telling an adult like a teacher or school counsillor if you do not feel comfortable talking to your parents about this situation, who can give you all your options and the consequences to these choices.  but i think talk to her cause shes going to be terrible scared, no matter what descion you make, you got yourself into it yourself and your going to have to be there for each other. its not like she can run away and she probably feels the same way aswell.  You guys did this so you are going to have to be brave and mature and deal with it, it is not a problem thats going to go away without some help.  if you do tell your parents which i recommend doing as they will be able to help you make the right descion the most as they know you guys best. they will be angry at first thats virtually gaurenteed but they will get over it. then they will be able to help you with your desicion.|`|Zm5YqJQraa	OK NO ABORTION........ I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER HAVING A CHILD IS THE BEST  THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ANY ONE.... WELL NO ONE I EVER READY TO BE A PARENT LITTLE BOY...

BUT FROM HERE I AM MY BABY'S DADDY WALKED OUT ON ME AND IF SHE  KEEPS IT UR MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE IF U WALK AWAY FROM HERE YOU DONE IT PAY THE PRICE|`|PzokT6S6aa	Well, most of the time a girl can only get an abortion if; Having the baby would harm the woman's mental or physical health more than having the abortion. (This involves the woman explaining how she feels about the pregnancy to a doctor.) Having the baby would harm the mental or physical health of any children she already has. The abortion is necessary to save the woman's life or prevent serious permanent harm to her mental or physical health, or, there is a high risk that the baby would be seriously handicapped. And in your case a young woman under 16 can have an abortion but other special rules apply about consent. She could have a medical abortion (take a pill), or a vacuum abortion (just what it sound like, and also very painful). If you act within the first 12 weeks, at the most, they are usually free, but the sooner the better and easier. The women will usually be in pain for the next few days after, and is to see a doctor for the next six weeks. If you are not ready to be a father, which I don't think many people are at 14, this may be the way to go. Please, talk to a trusted adult or an older sibling. It will be hard, but very much worth it. If needed, confront them with a friend, or the girl. They will have advise and help you through this, I guarantee it. You might even consider adoption. However, if you go with adoption, and the girl wants an education, there are schools for pregnant teens if she's not ready to go back to her regular school. I hope this helps and please think carefully about decisions in the future. Remember, It takes one second to ruin a life, but many to put it back together.|`|y1oE54aMaa	Wow,that's a really big question.Well,first of all...I know you wouldn't want somebody coming up and telling you that "You shouldn't have had sex in the first place." but its true.Maybe you should have planed earlier and gotten a better condom.I have never had sex before so..I can't say but maybe the condom ripped while in the process.14?I am the same age.Don't run away.Just discuss with the girl about what to do next.Don't panic because you never know,something like this can come out to be something way better than you think it would be.I'll be praying for you.It would be nice to hear from you again soon.

Both my kids were around 12-18 months when I switched them to a single bed.   As far as waking early. He is most likely getting his full amount of sleep (about 11-13 hours a day, including naps) Could you still be giving him naps? If so, cut back on the time of them, reduce it to only one or cut it out completely.|`|ra69rxxgaa	33 to 35. I still have my race car bed, and I'm 23. Also, why does your son sleep on flour?

One recommendation i have for you is to perhaps take the bulb out of the light.  Keep a nite light (if he sleeps with one) so even if he gets up early and tries to turn it on he will see it's not working.

aCUHzMrmaa	No games.  Not at first anyway. You'll have to seriosuly talk to her and be truthful.  I had bad RAD so i know.  Shes messed up and you have an explanation to give her.  I'm sure she'll be happy but shes still bitter or at least will be later on in life.  Maybe later ask things to  show you have interest like her fav color, and games and then you can maybe play games and start bonding.

The biggest thing to do...that I admit is challenging sometimes, is put her on a schedule. This helps regulate her body.  If she is taking long naps during the day cut them down, do the same thing each night, give her a bath, rock her or read her a book and then put her tot bed in the way you choose, but do it the same every night.  This should help regulate her schedule....good luck to you, I know it is hard!|`|h1AmqSOraa	feed her, cradle her in your arms and sing a lullaby orrub her and rock her cradle and hum.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	what is the cio method???|`|6hllX7nCaa	are you sure she isn't colicky don't take offense, or when she was a new born did she like being swaddled? if so my sister sewed all her reciving blankets together and formed a huge receiving blanket and swaddled her baby until she was 9months crazy but it worked like a charm she cryed all the time and she loved being wrapped up
7C9Ett7Caa	Dont express any milk from your nipples at all, the milk will build up and dry out on its own. If any is expressed from ur nipples, ur boobs will make more milk, so do your best to keep that milk in, lol. After your milk dries, your boobs definately become deflated. Since your boobs grew so much in such a short period of time, it really stretches the skin out, after theres nothing in there to keep them full, they'll sag and deflate..which sux. Im asking for the pills that dries your milk before i even leave the hospital so my boobs dont get saggy, lol.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its your choice to give formula rather than treat post-partum depression and breastfeed.  However any doctor that would tell you to stop breastfeeding so you can take a drug is obviously completely ignorant and dangerous.    By not giving you the information on how to reduce your milk supply as safely as possible he leaves you at high risk of plugged ducts, mastitis, breast abscess (which can require surgery) and DEPRESSION from the rapid hormone fluctuations.        Too much milk: Sage and other herbs for decreasing milk supply  http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksuppl...        This is best used only if you are in the process of weaning, though it may also be used in extreme cases of oversupply when the usual measures are not effective. Be careful with this if you are not in the weaning process! Dont overdo it once youre seeing some results.    A Sample Seven Day Dry-Up Plan  http://web.archive.org/web/2004120411401...        In the past, new mothers often received medication which would suppress the production of milk. These medications were often referred to as dry up drugs. These drugs are no longer available because of severe health problems experienced by many mothers.        Although most pregnancies have happy endings, some do not. Losing a baby is a tragic experience. When the breast milk starts to flow and there is no baby to feed, pain and engorgement will usually follow.        When breastfeeding is not part of your plan for any reason, follow the directions here to minimize pain and engorgement during the drying up period. Depending on your situation, you may wish to ask your doctor or healthcare provider for pain medication to use during the first week of drying-up    Guidelines For Rapid Reduction of Milk Supply  http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/d...        Sometimes breastfeeding mothers must quickly stop breastfeeding. I hope each mother has exhausted all avenues for help before taking this step. Nevertheless, all mothers have a right to wean safely and comfortably. These guidelines have helped many mothers:    Lactation Suppression lactation  http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html...        Once your milk supply is established, stopping abruptly causes certain physical changes. Your breasts will continue to produce milk for a while, and if some isn?t removed, you may become engorged, and possibly develop mastitis. You will also experience a sudden drop in prolaction levels, which may add to your feelings of depression.    Weaning after infant loss  http://xpedio02.childrenshc.org/stellent...        At Children?s Hospitals and Clinics, we support you during this difficult time. Your feelings are stronger because of the physical and hormonal changes in your body. Your breasts have been prepared to nurse. As long as your breasts sense a ?demand? for milk, they will keep making it. If there is no demand, they will gradually stop. In order to help you feel more comfortable during this time, we have prepared these instructions. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if there is anything else we can do to support you.    Lactation Suppression: Forgotten Aspect of Care for the Mother of a Dying Child  http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/4645...        Suppression of lactation prior to the 1990s was done with medications that influenced the brains directions to the breast regarding milk production, such as parlodel and bromocriptine. These were eventually found to have other brain-related side effects and taken off the market for milk cessation (Stehlin, 1990). Ice use was suggested in 1966 (Bristol, 1966), and both fluid restriction and forced fluids had time of popularity. Breast binding with ace wraps became the next form of care, with little scientific supportive evidence. A recent clinical study by Swift and Janke (2003) compared a control group using a support bra with an experimental group having their breasts bound. Swift and Janke found the women with bound breasts had more leakage, more pain, and needed more pain medication than the non-bound group. A study by a group of nurses in Sweden (Radestad, Nordin, Steineck, & Sjogren, 1998) did find that for women who had lost a baby, breast binding served as a concrete reality of the loss and aided in the grieving process. The use of cabbage leaves has often been suggested to ease the pain of lactation suppression. Several early reports indicated comfort to mothers, and this is a frequently recommended practice. Yetina Cochrane Library examination of evidence (Snowden, Renfrew, & Woolridge, 2003), cabbage leaves and other vegetable substances on the breast did not show greater comfort than the placebos. It was suggested that placement of the leaves on the breast and the massage of placement may be the helpful issue. The same results of improvement equal to the placebo occu|`|Grmsgziaaa	Hey!

My milk dried up no problem, but I didn't have much to begin with.  If you have a normal supply, I would hand express until you reach a comfort level.

I've seen some parenting sites define sleeping through the night as sleeping a 5-hour stretch.  I'm sorry, but to me, that is by definition not "sleeping through the night!"  If the baby goes 8 hours from the start of the bedtime feeding to when they wake up again (so 7 1/2+ hours sleeping), then I will say they have slept through the night.    When my babies went 8 hours:     1: 3 months     2: 6 months lasted a few weeks then back to waking up until 11 months     3: 11 months     4: 3 months     5: we'll see, he's only 3 weeks now    My early night sleepers slept in a crib or bassinet by the bed.

So, if it's a cold or allergies, there's nothing FDA approved over the counter except to use saline drops to ease the congestion a little and keep the nasal passages moist.    But, speak to the doctor. This does not mean that, if it's allergies, he can't prescribe something, or tell you specifically how much of a particular medication meant for older children you can give the baby. Bottom line: calling the doctor is the best thing to do when the youngsters are sick, don't try to medicate them yourself.|`|KenMyZU0aa	There isn't much to do for a baby.

She was in the neonatal room for approximately 4 weeks after having the intestines returned to her abdomen, an artificial belly button created and having some issues with fluid in her head area regulated.  She went back after one week at home to have a hernia repaired.  She has been terrific ever since.  She goes for regular checkups once a year at the hospital where she was born. She was 4 lbs and 3 oz. at birth and is about 40 lbs. now.  She is normal in every way and is at age level with everything but a little behind in hand/eye coordination, which is perfectly normal for a child of her age.  I would think that your child could be released as early as 3 weeks if there are no further complications.  My grandchild had an issue with fluid on her brain which they thought was hydrocephilus but, ended up being something else.  She had a shunt put in her head to relieve the pressure and the fluid but no longer needs it since she didn't actually have hydrocephilus.  They can never remove the shunt since it could do more damage by removing it but she is as perfect as can be.  Her belly button looks a little different than most childrens but who cares.   She is absolutely beautiful and it makes no difference.  Good luck with you little one.  (and yes, they do a C-section to avoid further damage to the intestines, which need to be handled carefully until they can be inserted back into the abdominal cavity.)

If he believes what others are saying this may not be the kind of relationship you want to be in.  Just be honest with him and if he chooses to dump you there is someone out there better for you!  You ex sounds jealous and sounds to me like he is trying to break you guys up.|`|hgmgH83Xaa	I am a 26 year old married woman with plenty of experience in relationships. First of all, you and Jacob are in a relationship. Jacob needs to ask himself WHY he is listening to gossip from his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. If he really trusts you, he would not be concerned with what was going on in a relationship before him. If he is serious about being with you, then he shouldn't be willing to accept outside opiions from your ex-boyfriend of all people. Although, Aaron may know you very well, but your relationshp with him is over. He may be hurt that you said you wouldn't date Jacob and you did. If you didn't say that, then fine, but if you did, that's okay too. People are entitled to change their minds, and it's none of his business who you are going to be with after you and him are through. (unless it's a family member or friend or something). Jacob ought to question Aaron's motives and why he is sharing this infiormation with him...information that would undoubtly dissrupt the course of your current relationship.    It sounds like a sticky situation for you. I have to be honest, from the outside looking in, I would say that you should sever ties with both of these guys.  You don't need someone that is in a relationship with you, but behaving as if he is in one with your ex. You need to be in a relationship with someone that will stand by your side and trust you. You need a man that your ex wouldn't feel comfrortable approaching on such a topic, and if he did, the ideal guy for you would verbally put him in his place. You don't deserve an ultimatum, and don't wait until 9:00, make the choice for yourself...you're worth it.    Good luck!|`|ato6Q90xaa	this kid jacob sounds like a huge *** so dump him first trust me|`|Mt1C8acTaa	wow. dump both|`|eKLE3KhOaa	Guy Here. Forget him.

Long story short. If he likes you, he'll keep you, trust me. And if you told a lie, then it is your fault. I can't tell.

"honesty is the best policy" and all that. Stop talking to Aaron right away. Ask Jacob to to someplace where you guys can talk it out and tell him what really went down.

I was dating this guy named ***. He was sweet and cute. At the same time, ****, liked me. He started spreading rumors about us. One day a different guy came up to me and told me *** was using me. I denied it because I thought it was just another rumor made by ****. Turned out it was true. I broke up with him and we never talked again.    Point is, you have to prove to your bf that you're telling the truth and aaron is just angry.
AA12300309	As a mom of a 9 month old with reflux, the answer is 100% yes!  After he cut his 2 bottom teeth, we cut his Prevacid back to once a day instead of twice. Everything was going good until he started cutting the top teeth, it was the same horrible reflux problems again, even with Tylenol & Motrin. I gave the pediatric gi dr a call and she said when they teethe it makes the reflux worse b/c of the excess saliva they swallow. Needless to say we had to start giving him prevacid twice a day again and also had to give him a dose of Maalox in between.|`|qBFojHLMaa	it can just bc they are drooling more and therefore swallowing more. I would definitely ask the DR, but it could just be his discomfort. Good Luck
wVxyKWX2aa	My eldest boy just started school last week (YAY) and I can understand your dilemma. The key is to figure out a routine that works for you both.  I actually stopped him going for a nap during the last 6 months as they don't have naps at school. And I started to teach him about time, eg no snack until 10am/3pm, lunch at 12, dinner at 6pm. There were a few tantrums for the first week but he got used to it. It took a long time for him to get completely toilet trained. What worked for him was a sticker on a chart each time he used the toilet by himself during the day. (Still working on nights) When he got 10 stickers he could have treat, like a cookie. After a while it finally clicked for him and he can go to the toilet by himself. You need to be consistent and try taking her to the toilet every 2-3 hours.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Just start fitting her into your schedule.     When you get up, wake her up. When you have breakfast, sit at the table and have breakfast with her. If she's still taking naps, make a time for a nap (after lunch is a good time) put her into bed, read her a story, wake her up at a specific time an hour or two later. Make her a snack when she gets up. Feed her dinner with you. Decide on a good bedtime routine and stick to it. My daughters four and I get her to put on her pajamas and choose 3 stories to read while I make her a hot chocolate. She has her hot chocolate while I read, then lights out.     You could try getting a special seat for the toilet and a little stool so she can sit on the toilet comfortably. If you have two toilets in your house assign one just for her so they can stay there. I folded a little pile of toilet paper and left it on top of the toilet roll for my daughter when she was still learning.
d71203d118a10dbd920ebc4a3ac6942caa	Changing bottles or changing formula. If breastfed then I have no clue|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	cereal in the bottle   its what the ped told me yto do with my son   and he didnt choke and knows how to ea off of a spoon|`|fiUqIyVcaa	Let your baby sleep in his carrier or his car seat which will keep his head elevated above his little stomach which will help his little belly empty faster and keep him from refluxing.    Another alternative would be to buy a "wedge" pillow which would also keep his head elevated.  A regular pillow is too soft for a newborn and poses as a suffocation risk but the wedge pillow is firm without being hard and will not let your baby sink up in it like a regular pillow.    Also try smaller feedings given closer together instead of giving him a full feeding at a time.  Just give him an ounce or perhaps 2 ounces at a time, burp him really really good.  Wait at least 1 hour and then give him a little more.  I know this way it seems that you are feeding all the time but it will allow him to let the formula pass out of his stomach before adding more.  As long as he is getting some formula on a regular schedule he will not get hungry and will get the hydration that he requires rather than giving him one large full feeding that just won't stay down long enough to do him any good.  Keep his head elevated in a semi-sitting position such as in his carseat, carrier or bouncy seat after he eats.    As he starts tolerating his feedings and keeping them down, you can add some cereal to the formula to make it a little thicker.  It helps the formula to stay down.  It only takes approximately 1 teaspoon of cereal per 2 ounces of formula.    Since your baby is over 4 months old, I am sure that you probably have already tried the different types of formulas.  If none of them have improved the reflux, it probably was not the formula it was true reflux.  There are some medicines such as zantac that must be dosed and prescribed by a physician for use in infants.      Sometimes it is also helpful to soothe the irritated stomach muscles by giving your baby a small amount of water approximately 2 to 4 ounces that is sweetened with one teaspoonfull of KARO light corn syrup.  Just stir it in the water and then let the baby suck it from its bottle.  You should only offer 1 or 2 bottles of the sweetened water to the baby per day and do not exceed 2 bottles because to much water can flush out too many of your babies nutrients.  But for a 4 month old, it is perfectly safe to give 1 or 2 (4 ounce) bottles per day.    Also, cold formula seems to be refluxed faster than formula that has been slightly warmed.  You don't want the formula hot, only a little warmer than room temperature.  It warm formula does not excite the stomach muscles as much as cold or room temp formula does.  It makes it easier for the baby with reflux to digest.    I hope this helps.  I am an OB - Newborn Nursery Nurse.|`|FxXaBd16aa	I would call your doctor.. my son had this when he was a baby and it was terrible. Have you had heartburn or reflux? It is SOOOOO painfull! your doctor will put them on baby zantac and that will take care of things within a day or so|`|AaoclPYCaa	I don't think there is a natural remedy but I know there are meds available that will help.  Don't let your baby suffer talk to the doctor.  We just went through this with my grandson.  They put him on meds when he was just a couple weeks old.  He is 5 months now and doesn't have to take them anymore.|`|RYmkmyuvaa	My child had reflux for months.  He was put on liquid Zantac 2 times per day.  He is now 7 months and being weened off.  We also give him Colic Calm (coliccalm.com) 2 times per day.  It is all natural and very popular.  It is a miracle drug.  I buy it by the case!  Keep him upright after meals and keep them small.  I also use the wide neck Born Free bottles.|`|SKNxILUqaa	My baby had reflux for the first 3 months and was on baby zantac...some of the natural solutions I found were if they were breastfed then you should make sure that you are not eating anything with peanuts in it, in addition to other high allergin foods like milk products. I also held her upright after she ate and this seemed to help. But I really found helped was when I switched to formula...RIght away I weened her off the meds. without problems!
BTf36bukaa	Your question is really hard to understand due to grammer errors. But, yes taking the pill incorrectly can bring early periods. It has happened to me before. It does not sound like you are preagnant. I would call your doc. for instructions on how to take the pill to get things back on track.
aJLx0nhNaa	God, this is going to come up for us soon, so I have been thinking about.  Firstly, you need to "dress" those cables.  This means organizing each of them neatly so they are not tangled or overlapped, and then coiling up the extra cable and using a plastic cable tie to hold it in a neat bundle.  Then, assuming they all go into the same power strip, perhaps screw that to the wall (many have screw holes) above the child's reach or behind the desk.  And then attach cable clips to the wall to hold the cables all the way to the power strip.    Products for this kind of work should be available at Radio Shack or any place like that.    I haven't done this yet, but it's on my list...|`|AaoclPYCaa	I can think of one good one.  Its called a playpen.  When you have your daughter in the room with the computer put her in the playpen.|`|wo9goWXUaa	There's an old proverbial truth........ You don't child-proof the house, you house-proof the child (this includes anything in your house also).  Mark my words, if you don't heed this advice, you'll have an 8 year old that won't/can't keep his/her hands off of things that don't belong to them. (Or just things they have no business messing with). I understand that your child is very young but that is the time to start. The key is that you have to be consistent. I hate to draw this analogy but it is just like house-breaking a pet.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Will a baby gate fit under there? You can put that in front of the wires. Otherwise a piece of ply wood would work. Just make sure to secure it in there pretty good.
6mhFHSRSaa	First, I am so sorry you have had to experience the loss of your baby. My heart breaks for you. My last pregnancy ended in miscarriage, and even though it was much earlier than 19 weeks, it was devastating. It takes time for everything to heal - emotionally and physically - and it's easy to want to just press the fast-forward button on life.    The hair loss you are experiencing, if it is the hair loss after delivery, is called Telogen effluvium, and it often happens after emotionally taxing events such as childbirth. Childbirth is emotional enough when everything looks good, and surely your situation would have caused even more emotional stress. It's fairly common, happening to about 10% of women, and hormones definitely play a role. For one thing, you no longer have estrogen in the same levels as during pregnancy. Estrogen fosters hair growth.     The not-so-good news is that this condition can take up to 15 months to clear up. That doesn't mean yours will last that long, and let's hope it doesn't!     There may be things you can do to help speed the healing. Talk to your doctor to make sure that your hormones are normalizing as they should and to make sure you don't have dietary deficiencies that may be contributing. In the meantime, thickeners or mousse may help your hair look better, as might a shorter hair cut.    Best of luck.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and it took almost 2 months for my hormones to return to normal.  I'm glad you mentioned hair loss, because I too have been losing handfuls of hair and I didn't know if that was normal.  I am very sorry for your loss and I wish you the best.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I'm sorry for your loss, you were far along in your pregnancy and your body is going through the normal changes after giving birth.  It should get back to normal soon, when you are back on your cycle, etc.  If you have concerns talk to your doctor.  Good Luck
AA10378447	There is a good chance; however, the cervical mucus has to provide the right environment. Sperm will last about 4, sometimes up to 7 days in the right conditions.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	There is a very good chance.|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	If they are healthy I say the chances are still good. I hear 3-5 days is the lifespan, healthy ones closer to the 5 day mark.    Good luck!|`|wTT8XpKpaa	They say sperm live in you for 5 days... Gross hey!|`|3MDY29gnaa	sperm can live up to 3-5days!!! so yeah!|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hi miss lovely,    One sperm takes about 100 days to make and a poor health, diet or uncontrolled environment can easily damage the quality or itself.    Before an egg becomes fertilized, a sperm must make a long journey. A man must have a normal number of motile sperms a man can produce and of these, he transports them through the epididymus and vas deferens. He has an erection and ejaculation in order to deposit sperm in the vagina of a healthy fertile woman. A healthy sperm should be capable of swimming through the cervical mucus and travel through the Fallopian tubes at reaches a newly ovulated egg at the end. But work does not stop here. The sperm needs to recognize the egg and stick to the surface to release enzymes and penetrate into the shell of the egg and fertilize it. For the embryo to develop, the sperm DNA must be normal. Thats what a fertile male can do to ensure the right environment for a successful conception.    There are simple ways actually to keep the level of sperm count.More on it on source articles.
A5KbJEH1aa	Yeah i have.  It sucks doesn't it.  I'm having a baby boy and in my first and now in my last trimester i didn't want to move. I was constantly sick, felt so drained that i couldn't move, it just felt like all my muscles had given up on me.    The second trimester was okay for me though,  It all eased off and i though that was great..    THEN  it came back in the third trimester.    Its not too much fun i know,  anyway my advice take panadol for the pain,  and that may help with your sleeping aswel,  also at one stage i felt so horrible i went to the doctors,  and he told me to take strong panadol (can't exactly remember what they are called)  But they seemed to help a bit with the pain and the sleeping.    Hope your okay anyway,  and yeah id say your having a boy,  There stubborn little creatures aren't they =)    Good Luck.  And congratulations =)|`|d2bb48f9b71a310e9462198117bdcff1aa	my mom had a boy when she had badly exhausted.... but that is her mostof the time it will be a boy instead of a boy.|`|YUV9SNBuaa	Every pregnancy is different no matter what you may be having. My first pregnancy was a boy and I was barely sick at all, little bit of nausea from about 6-12 weeks but couldn't really complain much. I was very tired but nothing that kept me from my daily routine. I am almost 8 weeks with my second and so far has been about the same. It truly depends on your hormone levels which can vary for each pregnancy no matter if it's a boy or girl. Have you had an ultrasound yet? Sometimes extreme fatigue and nausea can mean twins!|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	I'm 32 yr old, 14 wks pregnant.  I felt very tired and exhausted up to about 12 wks.  I had no problem falling asleep and I could take nap after nap.  I was so tired I had to leave dishes in the sink overnight (something I usually don't do because it bothers me).  I think it also has something to do with the fact that you are older than when you had your previous two babies.  Sorry, I don't know if I was having a boy or girl yet.  Hope you feel better soon!|`|ZcKVGrUeaa	I can relate.  I'm 8 weeks now with my second bub and totally exhausted but cannot sleep and am feeling constantly sick.

Yesterday I literally couldn't do anything without massive effort and felt completely drained after I did do anything.

GPW6HUZFaa	Yes.  My daughter is mixed and has my straight hair, but the dryness of my husband's hair.  We use olive oil moisturizer in the ethnic hair care section.  It has helped a lot.  Our daughter is 7 months old and had bad cradle cap when she was only a couple months old.  We used that, ad have continued to use it occasionally.   Her hair gets tangled too, and we use "Just for Me" detangler in the ethnic section too.  It works wonders.  I love the stuff!
Mbuii5A4aa	Hi, I have been diagnosed w/ PCOS as well.  I experienced the same thing w/ my period running months at a time or skipping.  It is important to not let them go to long or you can actually slowly start hemorraging or become anemic.  I also experienced severe cramps and mood swings as well.  It is also more likely you will be overweight and or have trouble maintaining or losing a specific weight.  Dieting is much more difficult w/ PCOS for some people and they have specific diets for it as well.  The first time we tried to conceive I was put on medroxyprogesterone for 10 days to spark a cycle and then took clomid during days 5-9 and we became pregnant on our first try.  That pregnancy ended in miscarriage at 3 months.  The second time we got pregnant the second month of trying and now have a beautiful 2 1/2 year old boy.|`|bcZSIphUaa	I have PCOS.    Found out after coming off the pill 6 months ago and having NO periods in that time!    My symptoms are: not ovulating, no periods and pimples. I'm thin, so unlike most PCOS women weight is not as issue for me.    I haven't suffered a miscarriage and fingers crossed I never do.    I've been TTC since coming off the pill. I"ve started seeing an OBGYN and I've been put on Metformin which I'm really happy and excited about...in afew months I'll be trying Clomid...unless I'm pregnant before then!

VfTMkFaDaa	oh ya I have gone through the same. My daughter will be 8 months old now. She never liked the taste of milk when i tried mixing the supplements with it. Just lie down your baby on ur lap and gave him his most favorite toy and give the supplements through a dropper. That is how I do it. Initially she would through out some of it but now she sucks the medicine in.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	don't mix it, just give it to him, and then follow up with a bottle or nursing.  you dont want him to all of sudden not want milk because of the taste of the vitamins mixed in. you might have to give him some from a dropper and kinda rub his cheeks to swallow it.  just tell him what youre doing every time you do it - sounds silly because he's so young, but he'll be comforted by your explanation and he'll get used to the routine.|`|avx7bLnKaa	honestly if you live in a warm area and expose your son to sunlight every so often they get plenty of vitamin d  and the fact that you've been giving iron supplements means he is not iron deficient    I breastfed my first son til 8 months... he only got iron supplements for a month at this time as his iron was mildly low and never got iron supplements again  and I never had to give my son vitamin d supplements...although we do live in florida... plenty of sun    I'm breastfeeding my second son now and do not have to give iron or vitamin d supplements... I may have to do iron when he reaches 7-8 months as that is when my dr tests but unless he shows signs of being anemic then he is fine.....    you can always have your dr check his levels to see if he actually still needs the supplements...    again I live in florida so my dr says vitamin d is unnecessary if I give him 5 minutes of sun a day without sunscreen..    [and in regards to the iron drops I only gave them for half the month the dr told me too and when he checked his levels his levels were fine...    you may be able to stop the supplements especially since he is starting solids...ask the dr|`|qBEt621jaa	You could try some baby yogurt or pudding.

Your baby won't be mad at you for more than a few minutes lol.|`|nE7KqaSZaa	I don't know about the iron, but I know you can get the vitamin d that's just one drop instead of a whole dropper full if the baby doesn't like that.  I've heard of other moms putting the drop on their nipple right before feeding so that baby takes it in without thinking about it.  So happy to be feed they don't seem to mind.  I just use the full dropper and she loves it.
Mbuii5A4aa	We are trying to get pregnant as well and I will tell you what we did w/ our last child under the guidance of our doctor.  You are the most fertile days 14-21 of your cycle.  You should have sex at least every other day during that week if not everyday. Obviously you can have sex outside of that time period, but those are def. the most important days for trying.    Good luck!|`|ul79DG2kaa	If you have sex every day your partner will have less sperm for each try.  If yu wait a day or 2 in between you will have more sperm per ejaculation.  I would wait until the 7th and then do what you feel like.  At least this part of it is fun ;)|`|8RfmosODaa	Just do it everyday to increase your chances! Good Luck!|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Do it every other day.     Keep them strong!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Do it everyday just for fun,that way you have a better chance to get pregnant and it wont seem like your only having sex to get pregnant.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Some experts say you can do it everyday.  Some say you should do it everyother day...because sperm lives inside you for around 48 hours anyway...  That way the sperm are stronger than they would be everyday.  In theory, you could have had sex yesterday and not actually get pregnant until today.    But like I said...not all experts agree with this theory...so really it's up to you which way you want to go.  Either way, I'm sure it will work out for you eventually!    Good Luck :)|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Well being that sperm can last upto 5 days in the uterus and also i would probably do it every second day say do it the 7th then the 9th then the 11th and the 13th to be sure ! But what i would do is start to cheak your cervical mucus and buy some ovulation strips so you can really pin point when you ovulating also taking your temps help alot !  As for the sperm lasting let me tell you it does cause me and my partner were giving trying to conceive a little rest bit stress full so we thought we will take it as it comes and only had sex once in my fertile period and boom i am pregnant with fraternal twins !  Best of luck i hope everything goes well ! Just one bit of advice keep it fun dont take it to serious and it will happen 1|`|npWGkuwnaa	It might be fun but to get pregnant you need to be ovulating. To conceive sex could be a couple of days before the7th and any days up to the12th/13th. Sperm can live in your body up till 2/3 days. Has your doctor shown you the temperature  method? Its fool proof.|`|RHxnMCO6aa	having sex daily is goo no matter what. end of discussion.
816TYl4eaa	lol i would wait because you never know what could happen like it breaking or you falling and hitting the medal around the trampoline...good luck|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	you shouldn't jump on a trampoline without dr s ok!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	definitely need to wait 9 months. then the 6 weeks after that. when body is completely healed. Doctor will adivse     god bless x it is bad|`|nluNSDI4aa	Why would you wanna jump on a trampoline being pregnant in the first place? wow. get help|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Yea that is not a good idea. Wait.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	why in the hell would you even wanna do it at 9months?|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Not a good idea! You could harm YOURSELF AND/OR the baby! You could even miscarriage! =/  Don't do that to your precious baby.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	do not do this not a good idea|`|jUnFWPpuaa	My cousin had a ultra sound done and my aunt was being funny, trying, and jiggled her belly just to see what would happen. It was terrible. My mom was there and she said that the baby moved around so much that it really upset her. Anyway, if the baby can move around that much just by someone jiggling the belly by hand then jumping on a trampoline would surely be traumatic.|`|a2S2BrwBaa	Why would you want to do that?|`|AA11315360	Ask your doctor's opinion. Call the office and tell them you want to jump on a trampoline but need to know if they think it is a bad idea. I bet they will say yes it is a BAD idea. Wait until the baby is born to do this.

I know your pregnancy actually starts counting from when your last period started because by time the egg is fertilized and what not, it is already considered 2wks old.

cAtWxJG1aa	no, because they have life-threatening food allergies and it could literally kill them depending on what was in the food.  a lot of kids do have allergies these days, so it's actually a really bad idea for your friend to be offering young kids food without asking the parent first.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	no way!  thats weird.  i would never even offer another child food.  i'm an adult who knows better.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Never I think that your friend should understand why the mom did not want her child to take food from strangers. In this day and age no. I don't even want my kids to go out for halloween (I let them go door to door with their uncles but I get their own sugar free candies and sweets) Witch I really don't like them to have any ways.|`|3ctchU2faa	Its practicing common sense to not let your child take anything from a stranger. Its a good practice because you don't know who the person is, where the food came from, where its been, or if there is anything in it that might harm your child.  After seeing your friend do it with another child, sit down with your child/children and explain to them why they shouldn't take food from someone they don't know, or as long as you say they can. Get your friend in on it as well, and explain it from the other mothers point of view.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	No I don't. I would get onto my son if he took something from a stranger. And it's not that I would even suspect another Mother to be a threat. The point would be to teach my child "stranger danger" so I would not allow it.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	some people teach their kids not to eat in front of people and to SHARE! These people would be known as MOTHERS|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Hell no!  I would never allow my daughter to eat anything from a stranger!!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I would not allow this either and I'd never do it. You never know if the child has an allergy to something.|`|rAkWoweOaa	From a stranger, absolutely not.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	I try not to allow my kids to eat strangers food mostly for your same reasons. I can see why someone would be offended if they tried being nic and sharing their snack and the recipient was told not to take it.|`|dgRTkccBaa	No, i don't generally allow it.  I have offered food to other kids before but only after asking permission from their parents.  I will let my kids take a slice of cheese from the deli person or a cookie from the bakery person at the supermarket if it's offered, but other than that I don't let them eat food from strangers.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	situations do arise, it does happen our  kids are trained not to take food from strangers but what if your friend told the kid you can't have any go away?|`|AA10943329	No way. I would never give another child food without asking. What if they have sever anaphylactic allergies. I don't want to be responsible for a child's death.  Your friend should get over it and realise what she did is wrong. Always ask the parent first if it is ok.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	No, absolutely not! I don't even like when my mom, step dad, or aunt feeds my kids things without my knowledge or consent, I'd never allow a stranger to do it! My daughter is lactose intolerant and gets very sick from dairy products, you never know what other peoples children have allergies to so you shouldn't be feeding them things without permission from the parents.|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	if someone were ever to give my daughter food and i didnt know them, i would be very upset. I think i would actually attack the person(:|`|KjkDeFbeaa	Absolutely not there is a reason we have been teaching our kids          (for years) not to take candy/food from strangers!  Does your friend have children, I'm thinking no but I may be wrong.     .|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I do not allow my daughter to eat food that came from a stranger.|`|AA10730513	As a general rule, no. But I play it by ear.    Example: When my daughter was 2 years old, we were going on a long trip and stopped at a restaurant. The guy at the table next to ours offered her a cookie. It was individually wrapped and I had just seen the waitress put it on the table. In cases like that - I will allow her to accept it if she wants. But I either take it for her or walk right up there holding her hand. At 6 years old, she has never accepted something from a stranger without my permission. lol, she was even scared to accept a piece of candy from my mom's hairdresser the first few times she went because I wasn't there to give her permission.     In any case that the food is more questionable than what I am feeding her, I kindly decline the offer and tell them that we are working on the whole "don't talk to strangers / don't accept candy from strangers" rule. Every now and then someone will give me a rude look over it. But I usually get understanding compliments.     Any time another kid asks me for something or my daughter wants to share, we ask the parents for permission first. I am surprised that they usually say yes. I think there have only been 2 or 3 times that the parent declined. And those times, they took the kid straight to the car or picnic table for the snack they brought.|`|g7XmorbCaa	If your in a situation that you can't get out of -Like right away-(In front of the stranger type thing)Tell your kid they can have it later after supper or whatever and check it out When you can -if you think it is O.K. -Yea~ If not throw it in the trash. Promise your kid something else if they whine about it. Or just Straight out tell the person No Thank You= She is on low junk diet.|`|6EARGhYFaa	It depends what you mean by stranger - another mum at a childrens place, whether park, play centre - then I don't think its dangerous because they're feeding their own kids the same thing but I do agree with a and b. I'd rather they didn't but there are instances when its ruder and paranoid to create a fuss. I live in a small town where people still live by the standards of bygone days before we were all terrified that everyone was out to kill us or steal our children and I've had old people stop and offer sweets to my kids - I'd rather they didn't because I spend a lot of time teaching my children not to take sweets from strangers, on the other hand I'm not going to offend some old granny who thinks she's doing a kind thing for a cute kid. Also I don't want my kids to grow up paranoid, I don't want them to be afraid of everyone, you have to strike a balance, is it dangerous really? I think the worlds gone a bit mad.
h3IjAuCgaa	I would prob go get a Home pregnancy test just to make sure ! It isn't impossible if your not taking you pill correctly ! Also you could still be pregnant it could of been implantation  bleeding so id advise getting that test !|`|vKoHKYavaa	You could be... take a pregnancy test|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Yep|`|Mbuii5A4aa	The fact that you missed pills this month up your chances quite a bit.  On top of that while bc works most of the time, even when you are taking it correctly you have a chance of becoming pregnant.  While you may get negatives on a test a positive can occur up to 19 days after the last time you had sex unprotected.
suVd8lxXaa	Both with the paddle you can control the force which is good for minor offenses and the belt for major offenses the last time I got the belt I was 17 and it was always on the bare and always very effective|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	As my mother use to say    If You Can't Beat Them... Why Have Kids?    *edit* right I'lll answer seriously. Slapping a kid around the back of the legs is not abuse! it is going abit far to paddle them but a slap on the wrist or the back of the legs is one of the easiest ways to convey something being bad. Doing something that gets you a slap means you wont do it again, you equate the pain of the slap with the bad thing and don't do it again. Shock collars for dog's aren't animal abuse are they? they are more training tools. You are responsible as a parent for training your child to be a good person, teaching them from an early age in a way they can understand, Pain bad don't want pain, is one of the best ways to shape how your child will turn out. Smacking a child for being bad is not the same as abuse.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	there is no valid reason to spank any child on the bare skin unless you wish to humiliate them and cause them more pain than you otherwise would have .It also places the child in danger of injury     i promise you spanking on a clothed bottom can be very effective you dont need to resort  to this    In regards to what JIM said ...The only lesson you can teach a child by doing this is that you as a parent are a coward and that you should be locked up ..|`|JDxpjT34aa	I think using a paddle or belt is going a bit too far. I don't think spanking should ever be done with anything more painful than a small wood spoon and that should only be for children older than 4 or 5.|`|ddzmEVYFaa	No.  Neither is ever necessary.  it is entirely possible to raise kids without ever resorting to violence of any sort.    I know. I did it.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	I guess it depends on WHAT 'lesson' you want to teach them!!  .|`|6253169b02f2076d996076889f0591d0aa	No, but I think that people who do that are disgusting child abusers who should rot in jail forever.
r0ISrLc1aa	OH MY GOD THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME!    like back in december. i understand that they have a right to be mad at us but i think its a little unfair to call the school.    buuuut anyway, i had to go to like the drug/alcohol counselor, it wasnt a group meeting. basically i was just politely answered her questions and left. you'll be ok, just go and get it over with. then block it out of your memory after lol. good luck :)|`|FiUprYsvaa	When you have to talk, say Hi, Im so and so, my mom thinks I drank at a party the other night and made me come, Ill be over here texting.   Then id sit there and text your friends.     That's what I would do.|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	You are probably not going to have a choice. Next time, don't skip school to go to a party.|`|tyqN6qBUaa	Either don't go, or just suck it up and try to make the best out of it (new friends or at least entertainment, since schools are so shitty about anything when it comes to drugs or drinking).|`|a0n9QXUraa	They will set the date back later.  But if you don't go you'll have to go to Cowan....=/    That school....omg erica..  |`|l1STgPyRaa	well the easy thing would have been go to school instead but that is something that you cannot change,      it would seem like you have not got much choice in this matter so you will just have to deal with it as best that you can, or go into privet councilor if your mom is willing to send you and tell the school that she has it uncontrolled     Good luck

VC0hx8xvaa	I've found that insurance usually covers only a 20 week ultrasound that may or may not determine the gender anyways... but most of the time I've heard they do (then again I wasn't, some bbs are shy/in the wrong position at the time) but I've heard as early as 14+ weeks... hope that helps good luck!!|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah you could find out at 12 weeks...if they say boy it usually is but if they say girl..I would always get a second opinion if it that early.  my advice is really just to wait until 20 weeks,  it gives you comething to look forward to and it also is better to give the fetus a chance to really develop and then you'll feel more confident about what the sex is.  I completly understand the need to be prepared, I like either making a room for a girl or a boy,  and geting sex appropriate things for the baby...it makes palnning so much easier and hey...its still a surprise, just one thats a little earlier!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes it is possible. Best way to confirm that early is by 4d ultrasound.  The furthr the better baby is more developed.  2d i would wait again until 16 weeks so its more visible and can be 99% accurate.    god bless x|`|k9nLue0Uaa	they do an ultrasound around 20 weeks to find out the sex of the baby|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	It's usually when the anatomy scan is done, 18-20 weeks, although I've heard of people finding out sooner too.|`|MthIvBZ3aa	you know ANYTHING is possible! i didn't find out until 20 weeks.  even if you do find out now i would still hold off until much later to confirm what the baby's sex is because so much could change.  what may look like a penis may actually be the clitoris and vice versa. sometimes the technicians get things wrong...it's life!  but best wishes to you and your little one...hOw ExCitIng!!!|`|zSABr7praa	I found out at 14 weeks 2 days!  :)|`|j1ZE24AVaa	According to Babycenter.org their anatomy is formed by 18 weeks, their ovaries and testicles are formed. I would wait for another 6 weeks so you can be sure that their fully formed and you don't waste your time on the sonogram. I'm 18 and I made my appointment for next week because I can't wait either.     Good Luck
H7BJxgCEaa	yes they all have ridges they wear down after they get older its normal|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	my daughters are the same its normal
AA11220327	yes you deffinitly can, sometimes it fully engages durring active labor, and sometimes a c-section is necessary|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	Yes, you can.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	sometimes babys head wont engaged till the very end, i think u can go into labour before the head has engaged, but i cant be sure,|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	yeah some babies dont drop until an hour or so before birth|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Yes. My kid's butt was engaged, if you will, and I went into labor! 3-4 cm dilated with a breech presenting baby, and I still managed to go into labor, even though his head wasn't on my cervix. So anything's possible.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes very possible.    god bless
veO1RXrCaa	Ohh I remember that.  I had them when I was in labour with my son.  Those sucked and are probably normal.  I have only had one contraction like that with this baby.  And it was brought on by doing to much at once.  I would keep an eye on them though.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	there is a name for this but i cant spell it look up fake labour pain on the net. its normal but in doubt see a doctor. some women get it much early.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Some girls want it to feel grown up. So, I understand why you might want it to come. I got mine when I was 13....and I got it at camp....and ended up using toilet paper as pads for the whole week. It was awful. I was to embarrassed to ask. If you've been having the discharge, then you should start soon. Don't go anywhere without pads/tampons. It should happen soon. Stressing can delay it. Good Luck. ??|`|gRdSdeHsaa	YOU DONT WANT IT! TRUST ME! It is the most annoeying thing a girl can go through ... or one of them! haha .. be happy that you dont have it!|`|hneetSf2aa	you will get it when you get it...cant force it along|`|YLJXyS1iaa	Enjoy not having your period!|`|3ctchU2faa	I got my period when I was 12. About a week before my period, I started having bad stomach cramps, got a little bit bloated, and got cranky really easily.  It might have something to do with the fact that you are under weight. The average weight of someone who is healthy and 5 foot 5 is supposed to be 128 pounds, and your period can stop when you are under weight.   14 is becoming the average age to get it, but I suggest you ask your doctor about what you can do to be prepared for when it happens. Its different for every girl, so really the only person who can tell you is your own body.    Good luck!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You should get a period by the time you are 16.  If you don't get it by then that means that something isn't right and you should see a doctor.  Be patient- people are right when they tell you that you don't want it!  You don't want something to be wrong, but it is not a walk in the park.  You get horrible cramps and you gush blood and you will be uncomfortable and the blood can soak through your pants and run down your legs and if you don't happen to have pads or tampons when it shows you are stuck using toilet paper.  It really isn't a pleasant experience.|`|GcgrFMuNaa	YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR PERIOD.  Trust me, IT SUCKS. You should be happy.    Be careful what you wish for....    By the way, you are underweight. That's probably  why you don't have your period yet.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	There is no way to tell.  It can happen as young as 9 and as old as 15.  If you are getting hair and you are starting to get a figure then you're probably pretty close.  As far as the discharge goes, you might want to talk to you doctor and make sure that everything is going well.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Umm no one knows when they will have their period...It comes whenever it comes... i was 13 when i got mines.. Some girls don't get their period until they are 16 and sometimes a lil older..... its alright....it will come in due time....but in the mean time chill and have fun because once it comes there are gonna be times when you gonna wish it never did|`|9LTWa08Laa	i think its because you're very underweight for your height  you should be around 110-115    you're body isnt producing enough estrogen, so try gaining weight    plus you really dont want to have a period. it sucks|`|rjVALevtaa	14 years old is pretty late to get your first period, but if that's when your mom got hers, it's likely that you will get yours at 14 as well. My guess is that it could be any day now.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	honey...NOBODY will be able to tell you when you will get your damn period.    and enjoy being period-free while you can!    hell, you may not get your period for another 2-3 years. it's happened!    go outside and play :)|`|NW3tKobLaa	well you can't make yourself get it.  it's different for each person,  but trust me, it'll be coming soon  most likely this year. totally possible before camp in june  and then you'll wish it never came, like me lol  just be patient|`|ClbJXmr6aa	you dont weigh enough i know this girl who didnt start hers cause she didnt weigh enough|`|4npjIcPaaa	you'll get it really really soon. when you get it you won't want it. cramps;aches;pains;feels like peeing your pants.|`|DNknBxRWaa	Dunno. i got it when i was 12|`|f2siAy0raa	it could be because you are underweight|`|pF63IMyVaa	i can understand why you would want it, so you can be normal. but in reality you dont want it. dont worry it'll come.|`|0b2WSgpfaa	everyone gets it at different times!!!|`|bHPHp6lwaa	lol..  just wait a bit more Time   probably tomorrow is ur day!!|`|HrBkIT4raa	your pregnant get an abortion you hoar|`|x9cM3hJiaa	hahahaha girl enjoy it while you last. its probably because you are so light. so if you gain weight youll get it but just stay the way you are cause periods are not fun.|`|1ci89Hwhaa	Why do you care?|`|kABmcg5Yaa	I hope you get it, and then realize your a hemopheliac. Then you never stop bleeding and die|`|PRjCv4KJaa	ok im sry, but 91 pounds? 32 aa?  youve got a while to go     ps- are you anorexic? you're really tall for so little weight         pps- there are no magic things that you can do   plus, theyre right, IT SUCKS  imagine having diarehha for 5 days in a row all the time, 12+ times a year  and it stains like a b****|`|izZqdgazaa	Don't worry! It will come along when you least expect it. Think about it this way: A woman has a limited number of eggs and the sooner later you have your period, the longer you could potentially stay fertile. So, you don't have to worry about having kids until after college and all that. Relax!|`|UoAZzwacaa	It generally comes about a year after you get pubic hair. If your mom got hers at 14, it's likely that you'll get yours around the same time. You might also want to ask your grandmothers/aunts if you can, as puberty onset can be inherited from both sides of the family.    Since you're only 94 pounds with AA breasts, you might notice weight gain/breast growth, and possibly a growth spurt, which could also signal that you are going to start your period soon. I was about the same height/weight/cup size before I started my period, but I didn't start my growth spurt until after I got my period at 13, and my breasts didn't grow much until I was 14 or 15.    Puberty is a weird thing and hits everyone in different ways. Your best bet is again to ask women in your family and see when they started theirs, as it will give you a pretty accurate estimate of when you will get yours.|`|vqD08Pjgaa	trust me, you don't. anyway, everyone develops differently which means that people get their periods at different ages.Some girls don't get their own until they're like 16. Don't sweat it, it will come soon.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Like many others have said i am sure its because your underweight. Most girls who r underweight will get theres later in life. My bff was underweight an got hers at 16.   give your self a few years who knows it might come tomorrow. GL|`|8rAAjXusaa	It causes me PAIN! I am 13, got mine at 11 or 12|`|0JWnkFeZaa	Just wait when it comes you will wish that it didn't.  It hurts alot when you get the cramps.  It takes up a lot of time when you get it.|`|edtNYROOaa	youll get it dont worry. youll laugh when you look back at this question once you get it.|`|5LGIrOjVaa	Why would you want your period? Gawwd it sucks so bad! You feel awful when you have it too and it gets everywhere! ugh i hate it.|`|tG5Ff534aa	please come back a couple of years after you've had it and kick yourself for this question! lol    it will come eventually... so what if you're the only one who hasn't had it yet? if people are giving you grief about it... remind them that they have cramps and feel crappy a week of every month.    be patient & live it up while you can!|`|Hg6a657Jaa	Look.  I got mine when I was on this survival thing.  O.o    I felt the same way.  You gotta be patient.  And I have to say cramps suck SOOO much its not even funny.  If you  like head aches and back pain and bloatedness, then have a blast.  Also, when you get it, be careful what you say to your friends during PMS..O.o almost lost mine....    Also, when your parent's and siblings got it doesn't have any affect on when u'll get urs.      If you have any REAL personal questions, just e-mail me anytime. :D    ~~~~  good luck!    -morgan :}|`|aDe8zS31aa	i remember wanting to have it but now it totally SUCKS. Unlike other people, i don't get cramps, but u r most likely to get cramps and it will probably be very very very very very very painful.|`|3h2OJxg4aa	well... uh yeah i think i would probably want it over with if i was in your position. theres no way to really tell, you should talk to your doctor maybe. i have two friends that are 15 and still havent gotten it. and i also know someone that didnt get theirs until college. so just be patient, trust me, nothing to be excited about.|`|wTT8XpKpaa	Aww, make sure you print this out and keep it for when you have had your period for a few years, you can look back on it and laugh that you ever wished your period to come.  I know I was the same as you, probably same build too, all my friends got theirs before I even knew what it was, mine didn't start until I was 16. You just need to let go and stop stressing about it, the stress can make it worse, I suggest wearing a panty liner, not a full pad, just something to catch it if it starts so your not so worried.  No one can say when it is going to start sorry, it will come when its ready.  Good luck at camp! and try not to stress!|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	well. everyone develops differently. it's not something you should want. just have fun being a child. try eating more. you seem a bit underweight... that may be why you aren't getting it. also if you aren't developing a chest, that might be why also. but then again it just could relate back to your weight. just enjoy life and take it as it comes.|`|9f072b8d4c4bdd8c8692346722929479aa	itll come when it comes.. you cant rush mother nature.. youll get it just wait.. i got mines at 12 other friends who got theirs at 10.. i have a friend who is 16 and dosnt have it yet...|`|DkT8znckaa	Well it's totally normal not to have it at your age. Don't worry until you're about sixteen. I think the issue is probably your weight. You are fairly thin for your height. You should be between 98 and 145 pounds (between 95 and 140 if you are 5'4")  Thinner girls often get their periods later, while heavier ones often get them sooner. (Girls with Anorexia often stop getting their period once they reach a certain weight.) You could really get it at any time, but I'm not sure if you'll be getting it any time soon as long as you are so thin. I don't know why you'd want to get it before camp..... kind of bad timing, but if that's what you want..... I suggest looking up some things on nutrition and such. You should work toward being a healthy weight.|`|AA11611165	I know you dont wanna hear it...But.II prayed for my period every night to come ad when it finally did, i wanted to shoot myself. Its sick  bleh. cramps suckk ballz, but anyways, Im 14 and i got mine when i was like 11. You should get yours b4 your camp, but who knows, you could get it anyday now, or you cood get it when your 16. Its stupid how the age ranges cuz its anoyying when u dot know for sure when its coming. There should be like a set age and it should be like, 20, so little kids can get prego and have kids at like 14...crazy...=)

PVGoUSnqaa	I havnt used that alone, but I used to drink moms milk tea, which tasted bad and I had to drink a lot of it.  I reccommend More Milk Plus capsules.  They have fenugreek in them and they work amazing!  I barely made any milk and those were the only reason I could breastfeed.  Just search More Milk Plus capsules, you should be able to buy them online, ebay or in a vitamin store|`|JDxpjT34aa	I took one every two hours but it only helped a very slight bit. It wasn't even worth it but everyone is different, might as well try. And it does make your sweat smell like syrup.|`|g4EnJ5wpaa	I have used fenugreek and mothers milk, separate and together. It did not work for me. But I still recommend trying it, it seemed to work for a few of my girlfriends and a couple co workers! I think I may have started using it to late, I had already lost my milk.|`|hGqQIusSaa	I haven't used Fenugreek alone, but I've tried Mother's Milk Tea.  The tea worked wonders for me, but gives my daughter awful stomach pains so I can't drink it =(    I drank 3 cups the first day and the next day had a ton of milk.  It just didn't sit well with my daughter.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I took 6 fenugreek capsules every day for a month and it did nothing for me, but I've heard other women have had success with it.  IT may work differently for different women.  It doesn't hurt to give it a shot - if it doesn't work then at least you can say that you tried.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I took 9 a day along with 9 a day of Alfa Alfa and I noticed a difference, especially if I was pumping every two hours. It's worth a shot. It's dirt cheap too. You can get like a bottle of 100 610 mg capsules for $8.00.     I haven't tried the tea yet, but I heard it doesn't taste too good if you don't like the taste of anise or black licorice.|`|nMR5TfGAaa	I used fenugreek with my daughter, it made my sweat smell like maple syrup!  I felt it did work on me, if only a little.  It's worth a shot, I was doing everything at the time (pumping constantly - eating oatmeal taking fenugreek & blessed thistle) to increase my milk, but was not able to exclusively breastfeed- I eventually settled on formula & breastfeeding: she was full and satisfied, but still getting the antibodies from the breast.|`|a485e8f533a15dc3cc9e66f068f78342aa	It deffinatly increased mine. I take 3 pills, 3 times a day (with my meals) and my milk supply has doubled. The only downside to it is that my armpits smell like maple syrup LOL  But I used it with my 2nd child and now my youngest child and it works wonders!
AA10118973	Well as for the actual bottles I must say it is definitely a few too many. How ever as for the liners no way my three month old is now at five ounces however before that when he was using the 100 liner box at week and a half intervals, so you will need more. However if it is a question of convenience then nope I don't feel that you have too many. I fill the liners with the nursery water and leave them ready to add the powder formula. You will just have a bit more ready to go and you do not have to worry about clean up. Oh and that stuff about the breast well some of us (LIKE ME for example) had an emergency c-section and was separated from my son for more than 48 hours for medical reasons and my son would not latch on. So that BS about the breast is kind of offensive to those of us who do not have that PRIVILEGE. So before passing judgment we should take into consideration that the possibility of things beyond someones control can and DO happen.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That sounds like a lot.  We had 4 4 ouncers and I think we have 6 8 ouncers now, though one is AWOL and I can't find it.  The liners are fine, you'll use them.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think enought usually you should throw bottles out after 3 months maybe you will need more.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	45 bottles is enough to last at least 4 days with no dishwashing. That's pretty good! Where are you going to put all these bottles?|`|EHY3FnAmaa	So 45 bottles total? That is quite a bit, I would take a pack or 2 back and get something else you need|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	you may need more liners.. the 2 nipples for each bottle is good but seriously 45 bottles??? lmao     i had about 10-8oz playtex nursers and 8-4 oz playtex nursers|`|rAkWoweOaa	I have 8 and only use 4|`|A7cZtZFyaa	Yes 45 bottles is way too many!  What is a Nursing bottle anyway?  All you need is your breast!|`|kjdKkDAkaa	I hope you don't intend to make up all those bottles at once and keep in the refrigerator until using them.  You would be giving your baby spoiled milk.|`|RYmkmyuvaa	WOW!  That is a lot.  I have 8 glass bottles that get washed once a day in the dishwasher.  So I think you have more than enough.  I use the Born Free Wide neck 9 oz. bottles.|`|vB9VlHHkaa	trust me sweethart, you can NEVER have too many bottles.|`|R0EsQapRaa	Wow, that seems like alot.  I have 9 (8 oz.) bottles that I rotate everyday.  You will need to go up a size or two in nipples as the baby gets older so that the flow is more steady.|`|hGqQIusSaa	I have 7 bottles, probably more than I really need, but enough to stock up for the day in the fridge without having to clean a bottle every few hours...    45 is entirely too many! You'll never use them!|`|4v90WyUhaa	Oh my gosh that's overkill. Liners are ok but that's a lot of bottles. We only needed like 12 all together. Sell some on ebay.|`|dTLTNZTzaa	In my opinion it is a lot of bottles.  I have 6 - 4oz and 6 - 8 oz (for later).  I wash and sterilize them everyday after use and refill them as needed.   So if you have a chance to return them and get something else instead - go ahead.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	That is a lot! I have 2 4oz and 2 8oz and I also use the playtex drop in system. You don't have to wash bottles with that system you just toss the liners and wash the nipple it takes like 2 seconds after your done feeding. You really don't need all those bottles. You do go though a lot of liners though. I also breast feed so my baby doesn't use the bottle every time she eats either.
Xngq54vBaa	If she jumped grades midyear, you want to make sure that you schedule playdates with her new classmates so that she feels accepted and not ostracised.  Having friends and feeling a part of the class will go a long way to help her enjoy school.      That said, as I teacher, I love the Evan-Moor Daily Math Practice (make sure your daughter's class isn't doing it already), they have a parent version called Skill Sharpeners Math here's a link http://www.evan-moor.com/Title.aspx?Curr...  It's also important to give your child real world experiences in math.  Get her an analog watch to tell time using hands.  Have her count the change you get back or that you put in a jar.  In my class we play the card game SLAP, but instead of slapping when there's a match, we slap when the sum of the two numbers we turn over is a certain number (for example, we'll work on our "Making Tens" facts and slap when the two cards are 3 and 7 or 4 and 6), just remove the face cards.  We also do a lot of "wrap-ups" for basic facts practice... they're great because you can keep them in the car or in your purse and pull them out whenever you have to wait in a line.  I haven't used the CDs, but here's a link http://www.amazon.com/WRAP-UP-BASIC-MATH...    For science, Teacher Created Materials has a book (CM50163-Standards-Based Investigations: Science Labs Grades K-2)  that has all kinds of science experiments and follow-up questions (plus background information so you know the answers to the questions that go a little more in depth) Here's a link to that one. http://www.teachercreatedmaterials.com/e...    Great job being proactive in your child's education - happy schooling!|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	Do science things that involve math. In a few years, force and motion (physics) is not out of the question. Make word problems that involve science. And get her tested for the gifted program if your district has one.|`|rAljs54naa	Get her involved in some science activities outside of school. aybe buy her some books about science experiments that she can safely conduct at your house. Math? Try getting her a nice, easy-going tutor. Maybe someone who's still in school that works well with kids. If she's with a teenager, she's going to more than likely look up to whoever it is. My advice, make sure it's a girl. you wouldn't want to end up with her crushing on someone. I hope I've helped.

But I got through my second with no pain relief whatsoever.  As have 99% of women through history.  It's fine.|`|jbKQZVkhaa	The worse part for me was the contractions. Just remember to breathe. Breathe in thru the nose and deep breath out thru mouth. It does work! Try to relax, although it's hard. Each contraction is one closer to your baby. The actul labour for me felt like I needed the toilet and then it felt like burning but not for long.|`|OZ474DMYaa	i had a 13 hour labor with no meds that ended in a c-section. i started at 1cm dilated and after 13 hours was hardly a 4 and they had already broken my water so I had to have a c-section. I think its painful no matter what age you are. I was 23 when I had my son.    ETA: i should also mention that i was induced cause my son was 2 weeks overdue. also i had a long recovery time cause my incision opened up. i had to pack and open wound the entire 6 weeks then had to still recover from everything. it was hard but the pain and everything is totally worth it.|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	hello :)    i gave birth naturally 12 weeks ago and looking back its not as painful as i thought it would be! (everyone is different though)  I was in the laten phase for 2 days, so basically screaming every 5 to 10 mins and no sleep for 2 days before i got to hospital.  then at 3 am of the second day i thought 'that's it, i can not take it anymore' so headed to hospital, when they checked me, i was 5 cm dilated YAY!  then baby was in distress so they took me to the theatre for a c-section BUT thank god baby's heart was fine after a while being monitored, so was taken to the delivery room, then i was on gas and air, and it got Very painful towards the end (i had an epidural at 8 cm) then my baby girl was born at 10am with forceps/episiotomy (cut)   i stayed in hospital for 4 days and that was the worse part of the whole thing as its soooo depressing with all the babies crying and the very small space ...all in all it was a great experience :)|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	I had my first baby at 24 and my second at 26. I think I speak for almost everyone on this one by saying the first is gonna be the hardest! and longest.  After that your muscles are stretched and I think your mentally more able to cope and understand what is to come next.     My first labor lasted 19 hours, with epidural and stitching. It took me 8 weeks to recover (this was a pretty extreme case)    My second was 7 hours, drug free, 3rd degree tearing (it wasn't as bad as it sounds) and 2 weeks to recover.   Hope this has helped.|`|SYRqxCMDaa	to make a long story short. probably like 20 minutes after i got the epidural, i didnt feel anything. i was so numb. i didnt feel when i was pushing either. or the tear he gave me.    go with the epi!    Edit: my labor was 28 hours and i am 22.  there was only about an hour through the whole process that i felt contractions. i got lucky, i didn't feel my contractions for the first 11 hours or so. after that time i started to feel them and they started like bad cramps and got worse and worse and more frequent. then it became horrible. i think the pain would be unbearable (for me anyway. people tolerate and manage pain different) if i did not get the epi. the contractions i felt i know is not even close to what they would have been toward the end. and pushing.(which i felt no part of. ) i dont know how people manage without meds. but good for them.  i dont think it matters what age you are. it hurts.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	I was in labor for like 34 hrs and it ended up in a c-section and i think it gets worse as you get older everything from the pregnancy to the birth cuz when i got preg. with my last one iwas crying and praying to god for it to be over i was older and my body just wasnt handling it good like before.So yes i do think it gets worse when you get older.|`|WQR0KEqZaa	hi, my first labour was ok for a 9lb baby my second with twins was really good not too painful and my little girl who is 5 weeks old was the worse pain ever, i think ever labour is different.  good luck x|`|nwWBddEnaa	i had a very short labour with my daughter who was my first 15 minutes from when my waters broke to he in my arms, the midwives told me i would be hours, they didn't believe me when i said straight away i needed to push, she told me that i wasn't ready and to get on the bed so she could check and was shocked when the baby was there, i think the pain is more of a burning pain than anything else but i think it will always be like that- my labour was 7 months ago and i remember it like it was yesterday and in 5 months i'm going through it again. i wish you the best of luck x|`|1zQB6546aa	My son came on his due date and from start to finish it took 17 hours.

It was very painful and near the end I almost begged them for a c-section because I was so tired.   But eventually he came out and had to be rushed out for some air because it was such a long time and he was exhausted too!  Straight after I said that no way would I have another - but its amazing how quickly you forget the pain, I cant remember how it felt at all and it was only 11 weeks ago!

Early labour  can take hours, or even days as contractions start to build up and put pressure on your cervix (neck of the womb) to thin (efface) and open up (dilate). Unless theres a medical reason for you to go early to hospital, youll be much more comfortable at home during this stage. Initially, contractions are short and infrequent and then gradually they will become stronger and closer together  During this time you may experience a 'show'. Keeping mobile during early labour will help and you should continue to eat and drink normally. Contact your midwife if you need advice.    First stage labour   Strong, regular contractions, lasting about 4560 seconds and coming every five to 10 minutes, indicate that you are in established labour. You will need to ring the labour ward then go to the hospital. If you are having a home birth, now is the time to call your midwife.  The midwife will assess how far your labour has progressed  the cervix has to dilate to 10cm during the first stage  and your pain relief options will be discussed. Your baby will also be monitored, either with a hand-held Doppler or a foetal monitor, which is strapped to your abdomen. You will be encouraged to eat light snacks and to drink plenty of liquid during this stage.  As labour progresses your contractions will become really intense with virtually no gaps in between them. During this stage any pain relief you are having will be monitored. Your partner can help by offering you lots of encouragement and support. Sips of water, a cool flannel on your face or a massage may all help, but equally you may go into yourself to gather your strength and will hate any fussing. You may start to feel the urge to push.    Second stage  Think of the second stage, which can take up to an hour, as the final countdown to meeting your baby. Yes, its painful  but the end is in sight now and your midwife will help you through it. Your contractions will become even stronger and closer together and you will feel the urge to bear down and push with each one. With every push, your baby will move further down the birth canal and be closer to being born.  Eventually the babys head will crown, passing through the perineum and you may feel an intense burning sensation. The midwife will encourage you to pant, a succession of quick, short breaths to allow the perineum to stretch and not tear. In some cases you may tear or your midwife may want to perform a small cut  an episiotomy (this can be repaired with stitches after the birth).  Once your babys head is born, when you push with the next contraction, your baby will turn to allow one shoulder to come out, followed by the other. The feeling of relief is immense and the pain stops immediately; many women also feel an intense high at their achievement.  Once the baby is born, the cord will be clamped and cut  in some cases the new dad may want to do this  and the baby will be handed to you so that you have skin-to-skin contact if you wish. You may also want to put him to the breast.    Third stage: delivery of the placenta  Its not quite over yet! The placenta (or after-birth) now has to be expelled and in most cases this is quite straightforward. If you consent, your midwife will give you an injection of syntometrine as your baby is being born to speed up the delivery of the placenta (to between five and 20 minutes after the birth). It usually takes just a few pushes and its out, or your midwife may gently pull the cord to help to remove it while you relax your tummy.    After the birth While you are being cleaned up and given stitches  if they are needed  your baby will be checked over to make sure hes healthy    Pain relief in labour  Having a birthing partner  your partner, a relative or a friend  to give you encouragement and support will help you get through your labour. Its important to remember that everybody handles pain differently and has different thresholds for what they find acceptable. Labour isnt a competition and you dont win any medals for endurance if you go without pain relief.    Medical forms of pain relief    Entonox (gas and air) This is the most popular form of pain relief in labour, a half-and-half mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Nitrous oxide is a painkiller, but most women report that it makes them feel detached from the pain, rather than blocking it out completely. You administer it yourself by inhaling it at the beginning of a contraction through a mouthpiece or mask. It doesnt have any harmful effect on the baby, or affect your contractions.    Pethidine (or similar strong pain-killing drugs) These are sedative drugs that also relieve the pain from contractions. They are particularly useful in a long labour where you may need to rest  its hard to imagine but you can actu|`|OrKpKxkHaa	With my first, I was 18 years old. My water broke and I was admitted to the hospital. I didn't dialate much and wasn't contracting so they gave me pitocin. The entire labor, from water breaking until delivery, lasted about 12 hours. I pushed about 2 hours. My second, I was 25 and they induced me at 39 1/2 weeks. Again, I was put on pitocin but they ended up slowing me down since my doc had an emergency lol. So, it ended up lasting 12 hours also but this time I only pushed for 30 mins. I think the experience helped me remember what to do....not sure age was a factor. Good luck!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	My first baby. Age 20 induced at 38+2 due to gestational diabetes. 30 Min's labour from start to finish. Did it hurt? Yes. 6lb 9oz baby girl.    My second labour 41 weeks. Age 23. 50 Min's labour from start to finish. Did it hurt yes more than my first. 7lb 14oz baby girl.    My third labour? Don't know yet. 8 weeks pregnant.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I had a reasonably short labour - 7 hours.  Since i have only had one child, i can say it did hurt - but i chose not to have an epidural etc as i HATE needles and especially ones where you ahve to sign a waiver that excludes the hospital if they leave you paralysed.  I am 25  and i can say it hurt more because my son got himself stuck so he had to be vaccum delivered.
A7cZtZFyaa	Your baby is smart. He just wants the good stuff.    If you start supplementing with formula you will never have enough milk for your baby. Depending on how old he is, the both of you may still getting used to breastfeeding.  My experience? Breastfeeding was not easy in the beginning. You will not run out of milk unless you give formula. Breastfeeding is supply and demand and your supply will never meet his demand if he is not demanding the milk from you, because he is also getting formula.|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	hmmmm I want to breast feed but my baby wont be born for another 3 months so I might not be much help.  I know that if u are not producing enough milk that there are some foods that u can eat that MIGHT be decreasing your milk supply.  There are also supplements u can take to increase it, look around your health food store or ask your docotor.  There is also a mothers milk tea by Traditional Medicinals that might help too.  Anything is worth a shot right?  Please try to do a little research into it cause breast milk would be so much better for the baby, but I'm sure u know that since that is what u really want to do :-)      Good luck and I hope that helped! Congrats in the little one.|`|rjVALevtaa	This is a pretty common problem. I know you said your milk supply is low, but see if maybe you can pump 1-2 oz. out and mix the rest of the bottle with formula. He may be more interested in the bottle if there's also some breast milk in it.|`|acj9mB9Paa	You don't say how old your baby is.  That makes kind of a difference.  If he is really young (a few weeks) then you just need to keep nursing ALL the time.  The more you nurse, the more milk you will produce.  If you keep supplementing with formula you will NEVER produce enough!  Also, you need to pump between feedings.  This will help you produce more milk!!  It doesn't work, if you supplement you will end up feeding formula only.|`|eth48m7Iaa	You could try and wait until your breasts are full and then see if he will take it. He could have nipple confusion. try a different nipple or a new bottle. My son had that. he wouldn't take the breast after he had a bottle. Also they have La Leche league and they are breast feeding experts. U should look it up online. good luck.|`|sVcnkh1faa	You realize that if you didn't supplement, your supply would soon start matching your son's demands.... but since you are supplementing your natural supply will never catch up.  You are setting yourself up for a complete switchover to formula.    Maybe he's not hungry anymore... maybe he needs to burp more.  Maybe he is having issues with reflux and at the end of the feeding is when his belly starts to hurt.  Does he spit up a lot?|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I also do half and half. I use playtex drop in bottles and nestles goodstart formula and my baby loves it and takes the bottle just as well as my breast. They have these great slow flow nipples that look and feel more like the breast. They sell the kits at Target that comes with the 4oz the liners and the slow flow nipples and the 8oz bottles and fast flow nipples and liners. Plus with the drop ins no bottles to wash! Good luck hope I helped.|`|q51cevqLaa	I would pump to get your supply up.  You should produce enough for your baby.  Your boobs are supply and demand, the greater the demand, the more they will produce.  Plus, if you can just do all breastfeeding, that is awesome.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	my sister had this problem she had no choice but to drink lots of water and tea and try to produce more. Her son is now 1 & he is drinking whole milk and breast milk but he never liked the formula. she also would give him tea mixed with breast milk that way it had the taste of the milk but it was more. This worked out really good for her. Good Luck.|`|avx7bLnKaa	try boosting your milk supply....    use pumping after each feeding, try mother's milk tea or fenungreek [spelling]   and if you can get someone else to give the bottle of formula while you are pumping....    the more formula bottles you give the less milk you will make so nurse and then pump... get someone else to give him a bottle until you can nurse him or give him expressed milk    yuo can also mix any expressed milk into a formula bottle... however if you do this... it is only good for the formula time limit of 1 hr....    but pump pump pump.... breast milk is made on supply and demand... if your baby isn't sucking enough to make more milk or you aren't pumping it... you will make less until you may have to switch to formula totally    2nd, how old is your baby... if only a few days old then your milk should come in heavy soon    talk to a lactation consultant at your hospital or through La leche league [http://llli.org]
AA10624857	I have been pregnant 4 times. I have never experienced implantation bleeding and actually don't know anyone who has. With my first, I had some spotting when I was about 8 weeks along so that was definitely not from implantation. I had no vaginal bleeding with my middle 2 pregnancies. My 4th baby was conceived unexpectedly when I was reliably taking birth control pills. I didn't know I was pregnant and had 3 episodes of what appeared to be normal periods before finding out I was 17 weeks along at my yearly physical. So, I had bleeding, but it was during my normal period time so it wouldn't have been associated with implantation at all. A lot of what I hear questions whether there is any such thing as implantation bleeding and if there is, it occurs in few women.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I had implantation bleeding with my first, not with my second.  With my second pregnancy, I took a test when I was a day or two late.  It was negative so I assume that the test was correct and since I didn't have the implantation bleeding like the first time, I was convinced I wasn't pregnant.  Then two weeks past and no period.  I woke up one morning and threw up my coffee.  Took a test and it was positive.  Later the doctor confirmed that I was 6 weeks along when I took the second test.|`|AA10378447	I don't know anybody who has ever had that, really. The ladies I know who were pregnant skipped bleeding altogether, or had what they thought were "periods" through the first trimester and had no clue they were pregnant.|`|sk46uigvaa	I have never had implantation bleeding and nobody i know has had it either!?!?    i think it's very rare|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	with my daughter i didnt even know i was pregnant until i didnt have a period we were not trying . i missed a BC pill and BAM . i didnt spot or anything|`|8RfmosODaa	Some woman have it and others don't.

So everyone is different.|`|cen8SIssaa	this is my second pregnancy and i didnt have implantation bleeding for either.    i just had a missed period, took my test and viola...|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	I did not have implantation anything with my first. No clue I was pregnant until I started getting nausous about the time my period was due and when it didn't come I took a test and got a BFP. And the morning sickness stuck around for 4 and a half months!|`|0Td3MZj2aa	i had no bleeding whatsoever.  I really had no symptoms except sore bbs and i had alot of cramping.  I didnt even have morning sickness.  Everyone is different some women experience every symptom there is to have, some experience 2 or 3 and some experience none.  Except the missed period of course. Good Luck!!!|`|CRVi3YsOaa	i have had 3 kids so far, I am ttc  4 and i didn't bleed or cramp with any of them. I think i have been experiencing cramps right now, at least i hope so.

I don't even know why everyone tries to look for it.|`|3MDY29gnaa	im not pregnant but i had a MC. I think we as women read up on things to much. Not every woman has implation bleeding. Not every woman is the same hun!|`|75XtKw0Raa	For all my pregnancies, I experienced menstrual-type cramping in early pregnancy, swollen, sore breasts but never implantation bleeding.  I think it's very normal and individualistic for each women to experience varying types of symptoms.  I hope this helps in your endeavor.....|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Everyone always asks about implantation bleed but it really doesn't happen very often.

A7cZtZFyaa	Yes it is fairly normal.  My daughter would go cross-eyed up until about 2 weeks ago. She is 3 months old now and hardly ever does it.  Her pediatrician was not concerned about it and was confident it would straighten itself out. She was right!  If you are still concerned talk to your daughter's pediatrician about it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Wait and see.  My son did this.  It's really troubling, I know, but it can just fix itself.  It's not necessarily a problem, it's just them not having total control of their eyes yet.  My son just stopped doing it, I think around 3 months.  Even if there is a problem, if it's caught quickly there are non-surgical interventions.|`|eth48m7Iaa	I doubt anythings wrong with her. It happened to my son to and his eyes are fine.|`|RYmkmyuvaa	My baby did this as well.  He is now 7 months old and does not do it.  I think it lasted until 2-3 months or so.  They do not have they eye control we do and it is more difficult for them to focus on objects.  I wouldn't worry if it is only on occasion.  But if it is all the time, I would ask your doctor.|`|zGf8kBEkaa	It is normal for babies that young to cross their eyes.  They haven't developed the eye muscle strength to keep them straight yet.  There is nothing to worry about unless her eyes were permanently crossed, or if she's still crossing them at 6 months.    My 2 year old daughter wears glasses because her eyes cross - however, it did not develop until she was 8 months old, and in most cases, the crossing that requires glasses develops around 2 years old.
yxeRpHDUaa	It could also be the beginning of seperation anxiety which can hit anywhere from 7 months onwards. It doesn't last forever. I would say that lusing the cry-it-out method would probably make him feel worse.     I used the Baby Whisperer (tracey hogg - the english one) to help get DS' sleep back on track. She doesn't advocate CIO. Having a bed time routine helps a lot  - just doing the same things before bedtime. I also use a soft comforter as a sleep association. Do you use a soother? Maybe it might help to relax your boy.     I would think that CIO uisn't working since he is now afraid of the cot. You might need to go back to basics and lay down with him to get him to sleep so that he doesn't see falling alseep as such a terrible thing and learns to soothe himself first with you beside him and then later transferring him into the cot.     I hope it gets better for you in any case. You must feel at your wits end. if you lay donw to nap together at least you will get some sleep too!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Being home with your baby is about both of you.  You're a team.  It sounds like you need to find something that both of you enjoy doing and do it together.  It doesn't matter what it is.  7 month olds aren't "miserable" in the way that you or I could be.  They're just busy and curious and easily frustrated.    Take him for a walk and see what he likes to look at.  Switch up your schedule a bit.  Play him some music you like and dance around together.  Find something that he likes and that you like too.  Find moments to enjoy being with him and the fussy moments will seem less stressful.  It's not the baby, it's that you're not enjoying each other as a team.  Work on it, he has no control, but you have lots.  You can do it.|`|AA11202852	Talk to your pediatrician, and tell him/her all the things you've said in this post. If the best you hear is "this is his personality," find another doctor. You need professional advice. I would guess that your baby is affected by your stress level, and the more he reacts, the more stressed you get. It's a vicious cycle, and you need to break it, because your son can't. Babies respond to the atmosphere they're in.     Please keep looking for a sympathetic doctor, and get some help for both of you.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	Mom, he is possibly responding to your anxieties.  You need to relax.|`|qBEt621jaa	My first baby had colic, so I sympathize.  I would talk to your Dr. again and ask about further testing or counseling options.  You definitely need some help.  I wish I had a quick answer for you.  Hang in there.  Talk to everyone and don't be afraid to ask for help.  So many of us have been there.  I can tell you, it definitely gets better.  Mine is 4 years old now and is a very happy kid!  Good luck.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Oh, boy.  Imho, I *think* you need a break.  I looooooove my DD, but when I start feeling like you're writing here -- I get a sitter or leave DD with DH and run down the street naked (Ok, I don't actually do this, but going out to Borders for a coffee and a book feels like this!).  Don't stress it.  Enjoy the moment, laugh a crazy laugh if you need to.  Pack that baby up and go meet a girlfriend for coffee.  Join a mommy group, GO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU and tote that babe along.  He'll be FINE!!!  I promise.    My DD can have 'high-maintence' days and so I can understand.  Sometimes she's teething.  Yesterday she was sick with a cold.  I bundle her up and we go have fun and take naps together and just enjoy life and she perks right up (even if she was miserable five minutes ago).   Babies gets bored and anxious just like us.  Go buy a new CD - some salsa music, put it on and dance your **** off.  He'll love it - and if he doesn't, you'll feel better, ready to tackle anything that comes your way.|`|Ybq7kznPaa	He may be feeling what you are feeling. Anxious, frustration and so forth. Try to relax I know it can be hard to have a baby who just isn't happy no matter what. I dont believe in the "crying it out" method, I think that just teaches your baby nobodys going to come sooth him when he cries, By no means am I saying it's wrong tho. Plus when either one of my children cry I cant just sit and wait for it to stop. I would try speaking to his doc again. what was he talking about this may just be his personality? Thats crap! Babys dont usually cry for no reason. Unless its colick but that usually goes away by 4moths,|`|p6AMoTs8aa	my 8 month old is like that now but its because of the teething. I put baby oragel on her gums and that calms her down. you can try that with your son|`|q51cevqLaa	I am so sorry you are going through this.  It is hard to admit you aren't enjoying being a mother, but it is not an enjoyable job 100% of the time and I think we all have a hard time reaching out to others saying that.  My son was a pretty irritable baby the first few months too.  He didn't start sleeping through the night until 7 months.  Have you tried a swing?  It was a LIFE SAVER for me!  :)  My son just loved that thing and it calmed him alot.  Also, I am not a big fan of crying it out.  I just think it backfires and makes the baby insecure, then it is doubly worse than when you started.  There are a couple of good books out there that I liked "The Happiest Baby on the Block"  and the "No Cry Sleep Solution".  Try them out and I hope they help.  I have noticed with my son, it is constantly a new stage.  They do get crabby over teething, separation anxiety (even when you are there all the time!).|`|dFWPyMONaa	With the teething I used to use orajel all the time..but then i was walking in the store and I found Teething tablets...THEY ARE AMAZING and all natural. My daughter loves them. Now he can feel all the anxiety you are feeling so when you getting all upset and emotional he is feeling just as you are.. Its okay to just walk away and take a moment to your self. Now for bed time do you have a routine put in place? I know a clean kid is not bad but maybe cut it down to one bath just before bed time to mellow him out. Dim the lights down and have the house a little less loud. Don't force him to go to sleep. If he starts screaming and carrying on just put him down and go about your merry way. Then in a few minutes go and pick him up again and try to rock him to sleep once more...if not repeat it over and over...he will tire him self out and want mommy to snuggle with and go to sleep. It will get better it always does nothing is perfect and has its bumps but we all get through it. Now do you ever let anyone like family watch him at all so you and your hubby can get some alone time? That will help you out more than him...Mommy's need their own time too don't forget that. But don't worry it will all work out.
7EOLTC20aa	Oh sweetie, welcome to the wonderful world of 'womanhood'!      At this time in your life, things can be confusing and uncertain, but I wouldn't panic just yet.  Since you are just starting into the whole menstruation cycle, your body hasn't developed a regular cycle yet and being able to predict when exactly your monthly time will be is going to be hard for the first few months.      Don't panic, always carry pads/tampons just in case, and if you have a trusted or close woman in your life, like your mom or sister, try talking to them about all these changes you are going through too!    Best of luck to you hon!|`|xOvPuyfHaa	It's normal!  Calm down, you just started something that your body has to get used to. It's totally normal for you to have irregular period the first couple of times.

Your body is just getting used to everything!|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Don't worry. When you start for the very first time your period will be very irregular, and off. I started mine early, when I was only nine.

They're still so little, but they want so badly to be grown up.    I've found that my daughter is more likely to cooperate and listen better when she gets enough sleep (she still takes an afternoon nap) and has the opportunity to do big-girl things.  She also still needs to know that I'll give her plenty of hugs and snuggles when she needs them.    Last Saturday, she and her younger sister woke up before the rest of us, so she fixed Eggo waffles and poured juice for the two of them.  She was so proud of herself.  She also takes pride in creating her own artwork (without any input from me) and hanging it on her bedroom wall or wherever else I'll let her.    She's very interested in how things are made, so we talk about that a lot.  A few weeks ago, she helped me make a fleece tie blanket, and last week, my husband started a birdhouse project with her and her sister.    Try explaining to your son that he needs to use calm words with you when he has a problem with something (not just screaming or disobeying you), and you need to do the same with him.  Try to incorporate him into the rules, and give him as many choices as possible.    We were really struggling with my daughter about a month ago, and we've worked this past month to give her more responsibility, make her feel better about herself, and really listen to what she has to say.      One other thing I tried last week when she started in a screaming fit was that I made her write about it in a notebook while she had a time out in her bed.  She wrote one page about why she was angry and drew a picture, another page about what she'd done wrong, and another page with a sorry note for me and my husband.  It definitely calmed her down, and I think it made her think, too.  Now, that might not work for your son (depending on his personality), but maybe something similar would.    Good luck, and hang in there!  Just know that you're not alone.|`|rAljs54naa	Is he in school yet? That should straighten him up. If not, I think you should start punishing him for everything that he does wrong. Tell him if you do this, you can't have this....so on and so forth. You're going to feel bad about it but you have to toughen up if you want him to listen to you. Whatever you do though, make sure you do it out of love and make sure that he sees it. I wouldn't want him to start hating you. Be mean in a nice way. I know it's a paradox, but it can be done. :)|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	Has he been hanging around with kids in school who exhibit this sort of behavior?    Consistent discipline is going to be the key here.  Graduated disciplines can include:    - time out chair  - lose a favored toy  - lose a privilege (computer games, computer time, tv time, friends over, etc)    You might also make a chart that patterns the "caught'cha being good" philosophy.    Every time he behaves in a way you approve, he gets a star or a sticker, etc.  When he reaches a pre-determined goal, he earns a reward.  You can even build levels into it:    Maybe after 5 "good behavior" ticks, he can "buy" the right to stay up an extra 15 minutes past bedtime on the weekend.    Or he can bank those ticks and save up for level 2: 10 "good behavior" ticks earns him a trip to Dairy Queen    The idea is to show him that every action has consequences:  he gets to decide which sorts of consequences he wants to have.    Good luck!|`|kEuiW5nhaa	If he is in school that explains a lot of it.  He has been put into a room with 20ish kids of the same age group, all with their own bad habits, and expected to follow directions all day long. . . hence he is tired, and probably frustrated by the time he gets home.  You are his "safe zone" where he can totally go bonkers and you will still love him.  It is a phase, I have gone through it three times already (3 different kids) and it is no fun any of the times you do it, but it does get better.      Ward off meltdowns with a snack (healthy not junk) and a rest time, maybe reading to him etc - not in front of the tv which can be even more stimulating.  Explain that his behaviour is understood, but will not be tolerated and decide on a "code word" you can use with him when he starts to get out of control to help bring him back.  If the code word doesn't work, then you need to have a disciplinary action in place - time out/loss of privilege etc.  Give him his code word warning, give him a chance to cool down, if it doesn't work, move on to the action.  It usually only took a week for my kids to get it figured out.  They still slip up once in awhile, but mainly they keep themselves in check.  Having a silly code-word helps.  My son chose "farfignewton" my daughter chose "succatash" and my other daughter chose "beepboop".    Good luck and hopefully it passes soon!!|`|da3dbf485a1a2a02f98b2a8f7caa7e18aa	There could be a couple of things....my six year old acts out big time when she's sleepy. And when she's sleepy she fights sleep so getting her to go to bed or to take a nap is even more difficult. She talks back  A LOT when she's tired, makes poor decisions, and does seemingly whatever she can to get in trouble. Sleep usually cures this, so make sure he's getting enough sleep. Push his bed time up an hour if you have to. Another thing, is he in pre-school or kindergarten? That also seems to have helped with the behavior issues. The structure and discipline there seems to help at home. I have learned why parents live for "back to school" time!! :)|`|CguXFU4paa	Ah this wonderful stage. I am going through it with an 8 yr old girl. It is just a stage. I use the 123 magic with my children and this works for the talking back. It took a while but now I just say 1 and she generally will stop and go on about her buisiness. She is stubborn so if your son is not as stubborn it would be easier then she was.|`|f5a325bd71925b68d42a9d6bc17b3289aa	Be stern with him don't let him be the boss. If he has stared school I would ask his teacher if she has noticed a change in his behavior lately if she has request a parent teacher conference with her to see if the two of you can find out what could be bothering him also talk to him about his behavior ask him why he doesn't listen to you anymore and if something is bothering him. Before you assume he is just acking out for no reason look for a reason maybe school is getting to stressful now that the excitement has warn off or maybe a kid is picking on him? Anyway good luck.|`|RKTNDLDKaa	Remind him that you are the parent.     When you ask him to do something, he should do it, without hesitation ....... because you are the parent.      Talking back.     Let him know that he's talking back to you and that's not allowed.     Give him a couple of reminders so that he's aware of what "talking back" is.     If he continues, a time out would be appropriate.     Writing 15 sentences "I will not talk back" will make an impression on a 5 year old.       Take away privileges.    If you tell him to go brush his teeth and he continues playing his video game, remind him once.      If he does not do it, take away the video game privilege.      I usually go as far as to take away the privilege for as long as it takes for him to ask twice (like 2 or 3 separate days).     When you deny his request, remind him why he isn't allowed.       You should never laugh at any of his disobedient behavior, even if it is funny.   (this is a no-brainer, but lots of parents or adults forget and laugh or simply cannot help themselves).    He's just trying to do what everyone has been telling him for years, "you're such a big boy".      It's hard to sort out for a 5 year old.     That's why I am in favor of giving him several opportunities to correct each behavior.
iLRE4yF3aa	you should expect cramping, and your body is doing the same thing whether you're 4 weeks or 8 weeks pregnant. it should not vary, but i wouldn't say that it's set in stone. check out this site, it tells why what to expect and such. it said it would feel similar to menstrual cramps, just increasing and decreasing in severity in even increments.|`|RvVvaVsAaa	theres an abortion pill?? do explain...|`|AOfm8ey6aa	To all above me who ask about the abortion pill. Yes, they do exist and they work for first few weeks of the pregnancy. They were legal few years ago, I read about them in a medical magazine. If they are still legal I dont know, but might be not. There were several women who used them, had bad complications and some of them even died. It is extremely painful, they said it is much worse than regular vacum- extraction abortion. It makes woman cramp and bleed really badly for weeks.     If this is the pill you want to try out, think twice.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	At 4 weeks, an abortion isn't done with a pill, they put metal tong things inside you and scrape the wall of the womb (which has the fetus implanted in it)    Pill abortions are only good for the first 2 or 3 days, I think|`|jgtfWjE4aa	r we 15 here??|`|dcNmRPGPaa	my stars @ an Apparition pill...|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I worked with a girl who took the abortion pill at 5 weeks or so and said that she had really bad cramping for a couple weeks and lots of bleeding.

Coz I don't think the abortion pill is legal.|`|1jmWmcozaa	Never took the abortion pill but abortion it self is painful for a person emotionally and physically. It is also painful to the fetus.|`|ejxCPI43aa	the abortion pill is legal. and you do have severe cramping. but also if you get an abortion you will regret it for the rest of your life. thinking that you killed your own child growing inside of you.|`|PJSSdgf6aa	last time i heard about abortion i heard that the pill only works till 8 weeks of pregnancy, after that you would need to surgically remove the fetus!     good luck with everything|`|YT48OTKzaa	yes it would be very painful

No matter how light.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	if you can not ask directly thru this then how are you going to ask?    what do you mean kinda positive? like a faint line? people say that a faint line is a positive line.

A7cZtZFyaa	I think it is best to find out at about 20 weeks.  It is possible to tell a little before 20 weeks and of course they can tell after 20 weeks, but they can get the best view at 20 weeks. After 20 weeks the baby will not move around as freely and it may be too hard to see between his/her legs.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I heard people saying they went as early as 16 weeks.

SOYqxdC9aa	It could be absolutely nothing like gas and it will just go away on its own, or it could be something serious that needs medical attention.  Everyone hates going to the doc, but you can't come on here or go anywhere on the internet and get an answer that's as reliable as what a doc will be able to tell you.  Once you go and they are able to diagnose your pain and make you feel better, regardless of what it is, you'll feel much better and you'll be glad you went.    If the pain doesn't go away then go see a professional.  Take care of your body, it's the only one you'll get!|`|iMULlxdgaa	no offense but you really need to see your doctor, if your pregnant you'll be seeing a lot of doctors anyway so you might as well get used to it!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey it could be anything that is serious.  like food poisoning, Ulcer in the stomach.

FLOjzbKEaa	wait couple more days and see if the appetite comes back.  May be you lost it because of the morning sickness. if still the same yes, i would say go and check with your doctor.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	Try drinking Ensure and take your maternas and your baby will be fine. It's probably your morning sickness making you feel that way.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	in early pregnancy some women dont even want to look at food because it makes them nauseous. just try and eat saltines and drink water. thats what i had to do for the first....probably 8 weeks or so. your appetite will be back. i promise. and it will come back with a vengance!!|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Yeah it's totally normal but you should try to eat stuff you like. Don't force yourself to eat things you don't just for the nutrition since you won't feel good if you do that...Good luck!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	Wait for about a week and see if it gets better. I lost mine around 8 or 9 weeks and couldn't even keep down what I did eat. I finally had to go to Dr. and he said it was normal early on and he prescribed some meds. that helped keep food down.|`|9op65iQVaa	That's normal|`|GPW6HUZFaa	It's definitely normal.  Try eating something though.  Whatever sounds good.  Maybe a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, jelly and toast, or even crackers.  Just make sure to keep yourself hydrated.  If it keeps up too much longer, definitely see a doctor.|`|Ub68zTmxaa	loss of appetite is normal in early pregnancy. some women actually lose weight in their first trimester, that was the case for me bc i didn't have an appetite. but try to eat something at least. it will make u feel better to know u at least tried.Keep taking pre-natal vitamins to help with nourishment though and if you're a milk drinker then you can line your stomach with a glass of milk - flavoured or not. It'll pass though!  Also, Pregnant women may experience loss of appetite periodically during pregnancy. In most cases, this is only temporary and doesn't pose any risk to the mother or child. Only in extreme cases when nutrition is affected is it a big problem.     Morning sickness can be responsible for loss of appetite. When you are feeling nauseated, food is the last thing on your mind. Fortunately, for the vast majority of women morning sickness is a temporary issue and not severe enough to cause nutritional deficits.|`|mdPn6JLbaa	I've been told it's normal as I've been experiencing the same thing. I'm just past six weeks and have periods where my appetite is fine and I'll eat normally (like lunchtime today), but tonight I could barely choke down some soup because I just wasn't hungry.    Make sure you take a pre-natal vitamin so your baby is getting nutrients even if you aren't able to eat a ton. Don't try to force down anything that you don't want to eat. I've taken the same can of tuna to work for the past three days, but haven't been able to stomach the thought of eating it. I find things like toast with cinnamon (helps with nausea) and a bit of brown sugar, as well as oatmeal help. Don't stress too much - just make sure when you can eat that it's good and healthy. Whole-grain toast with some peanut butter is a good choice too.

sYsfI856aa	Nipple stimulation:    Rubbing, pinching, squeezing, tugging, etc... Stimulation of the nipples actually engages your body to release pitocin naturally rather than having to have it pumped into you.  This will have the same effect as the IV pitocin, but not as harsh as it's the natural kind.    Walking:    Walk as much as you can while staying comfortable, soon as your feet hurt, just go sit down.    Squats:    Doing squats is said to help bring baby into position as well as use the gravity to get the baby's head to dilate your cervix. Be sure to have something to hold on to while doing squats, preferrebly a someone in case you do fall over.    Sex:    Not just having sex, but actually him finishing inside of you. (recommended if in relationship with your man of course, random sex could be dangerous :D)  Male sperm has qualities in it that are said to actually help soften your cervix.    Raspberry Leaf Tea:    A tea that's actually been proven to help soften your cervix to help you dilate faster. Not sure how often you are supposed to drink it, but I would guess a couple of times a day.    Warm Baths:    Not super hot, but a warmer bath will not only help you relax but in turn can help things soften up and hurry along a little more. Remember no bubbles, but oils such as lavendar are fine, be sure to have someone there in case you can't get back out.    Finally:    Just stay relaxed. The more you stress out the tighter every muscle in your body will stay including those that help you progress.      Good luck, and I really hope you make it all naturally this time!|`|jTJNOUMwaa	I would just tell your doctor that you do not want to be induced as long as there is no medical reason that you need to be. As long as there are no complications with you or the baby you should be able to wait it out, as you said babies come when babies are ready.|`|bOxlw3ZHaa	Hi baby girl, ok during my pregnancy to get my babys out this is what I did and it worked with both my kids, one I took black kohosh or cohosh pills, I also drank red rasberry warm tea, walked like 6 blocks and had my doctor rip my membraine out down there, if you know what I mean, and within say 2 weeks i was having me a baby, or you can also walk around rubbing your nipples yes it sounds wierd but my doc told me to do it, and that will help cause you some contraction to help you dilated.... congrats and goodluck, before you start taking the pills contact your doctor or you can also ask the health food store that have vitamins and stuff they know what it is too....|`|44OH7Si6aa	Walking or climbing stairs, sex, eating spicy foods or pineapple, nipple stimulation, and you can always talk to your Doctor about membrane sweeping. Your doctor will sweep a finger around your cervix in order to separate the membranes around the baby from your cervix which causes you to release hormones that kick start labor. Many times they won't do this untill you hit 40 weeks|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	NUmber one thing I can think of, in your case, is to refuse! You don't have to be induced unless there is something wrong with you or the placenta/baby. If they suggest, prod, or poke, just say you don't want it this time and let your body do what it's supposed to.     My SIL has three kids; the first two were induced (one due to convenience of doctor's schedule, which is BS!) and by the third she had no idea what to expect because it wasn't induced. She said her first one was vacuum extracted and basically the Pitocin was a horrible experience.     You can do lots of things - walking, sex, just waiting it out in peace! LOL But if you don't want to be induced, then don't do it. It's your body, your baby, your call - as long as you and baby are healthy.     Good luck!|`|AA12204338	I had to be induced with both of my kids but it was because I had high b.p.  So, I wouldn't dare complain because it was what was safe for me and the girls.    Having said that...I read somewhere, eggplant Parmesan will do the trick.  I don't know if that's true!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Walking alot, sex (more so orgasm than acctual sex), climbing lots of stairs, drinking castor oil   My friend just had a baby-her water broke right after sex.

It put me into false labor the next night then I woke up at 6am the next day when my water broke in bed.     We kinda tried the sex thing but I was so huge it was literally  impossible. I went to the hospital when I was in false labor and the nurse told me to take 1 Motrin a day...it has the same hormone as sperm that helps bring labor along. I thought they said to never take anything but Tylenol but she told me since I was so far along at that point it might help.    I was in full blown labor with contractions 2-3 mins apart by the time I got into my labor/delivery room but they still gave me Pitocin. I made them wait until after the epidural though lol. I think they gave it to me because there was meconium in my waters so they wanted her out asap.    Good luck and congrats!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	WALK LIKE CRAZY!!!!!!!!!

Lots of it. Also, remember you have the right to tell your doctors that you do not want to be induced and want to give your baby more time. Don't let doctors force you to give birth and their convenience- especially when there is no medical necessity to give birth within a certain time constraint.|`|TzLxCXm9aa	i have 5lil boys, wish i could get a bump with a girl in it!lol ive had to be induced with the first 4 and felt the same as you, but even with pitocin i didnt really dialate so after the first 2 with over 29hrs of hard labor we figured out that if the doc broke my water the labor hit hard and baby was out in like 5hrs. dont know if itll help but might if you can get your doc to break your water first. hope this helps.|`|iGiLPpEXaa	I am 32 weeks pregnent with my third girl!  my first was induced due to doctors convience and  i was going to be induced with my second one at mid night but instead she had her on plan i went into labor about 3 oclock that day...by the time i got to the hospital i was dialated to an 8 and my contractions were 2 mins apart. i was only there for about 45 mins befor she was born. i didnt have any pain meds.  it was alot more painful but very worth it because it went SO much faster.....so i plan on the same thing with this one I HOPE!!!!    but if it helps any with my second one i walked ALOT!|`|B7FL0rdqaa	I've heard eating large amounts of greasy food i.e. Pizza, any deep fried foods, etc. And beer can induce pregnancy. At this point in your pregnancy these things will not at all harm the fetus. (I heard this from a nurse/practitioner!)  Also excessive walking/jogging (jogging obviously may not be entirely possible with a big baby in your belly, eh?)   Sex, intense orgasm has been known to induce pregnancy by causing the uterus to contract and expand more intensely than your braxton hicks contractions. But sex without orgasm typically will not give any results, save for possible disappointment? Haha.  Warm baths are also supposed to induce pregnancy.
oP504BtFaa	A note on V8 Splash - I am constantly amazed at how great it is for you!    My girls are older, so they drink soda like Fresca sometimes (0 calories and delicious to all you moms watching your calories out there!) as well as juice and other things but here are some option for youngsters:    -Juice, obviously (apple, berry, etc.Juicy Juice is our favorite)  -Drinkable Yogurts - can also pose as a snack (Danimals or Stoneyhill Farm, or whatever that brand is)  -milk (strawberry and chocolate milk)  -orange juice  -make smoothies  -Fruit 2 O - similar to propel but still an option!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I give her mostly water and milk but occasionally lemonade, its her favorite.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Vitamin water & Fuze|`|5D0KuT74aa	whisky, they like vodka too  jk :D  mostly water, we dont have a lot of juice and soda in our house|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Water, milk and sometimes 100% juice boxes.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	my daughter loves Mango Nectar but i water it down a bit as its very thick but she will drink it all the time if she could.  I also give her cordial (no sugar) but very rarely i prefer to give her fruit juices.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Vitamin D milk, V8 smoothie which I mix with milk (strawberry/banana), juice, and that'a about all she's allowed. She's only 18 months|`|Nti8czLvaa	We drink milk, juice, and water.  They have had favored water, and liked that.  Sorry we are kind of boring around here.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Milk. Seriously, between my 3 Boy (3yo-almost 5yo) and Hubby, Our house Guest, and I, we drink about 6 litres a day.  Thankfully I have a couple of milking cows so it's not expensive.    Ryan & Cody like their formula.     Dominik really likes sustagen milk  William likes apple juice (Ironically I craved it all throughout that pregnancy)  Tobias really likes water, but it must have ice in it.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Chocolate Milk, Apple Juice, White Grape Juice and Strawberry Kiwi Vitamin Water.  And of course, unfortunately...cokes.|`|iUMrd7qlaa	when i adopted a little girl, she drank strawberry and chocolate milk, juices, tea, water and sometimes Dr. pepper...... if you have anymore questions Instant message me on yahoo messenger at MRSMEIER060808|`|3S0WRhWCaa	Gatorade is one of my kids faves and they also like 7'up and apple juice.  Oh, Dr. Pepper is a treat.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter loves milk, she can't have regular cows milk anymore since we found out last month she is lactose intolerant but she like the Dairy Ease and Lactaid pretty good but she has been drinking more water lately than anything else.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	My nephews like drinking any flavor of propel or gatorade. They don't like drinking out of drink boxes, they will usually squeeze it and make a mess. They drink juice but like in bottels or in cups.    OMG! I went crazy when I seen your extra details said strawberry milk. MY 2 year old nephew drinks this EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!!!! He comes in my room and says "milk" and we are trying to get him off of it. That is so funny that these kids love it so much. He can't live without it.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	I like to drink   apple juice  milk  chocolate soy milk  diet pop  orange pop   root beer  Hot chocolate and coffee  I am 14.|`|M9wAOlk3aa	chocolate milk its gone before i know it ,i try to to get some quick otherwise i miss out|`|7PNbjit0aa	My kids are allowed only milk and water, with 1 cup a day of V8 original.  I will also make smoothies with fruit and natural youghurt along with meals.|`|2xkbOv23aa	my kids like plain old water but it has to have ice cubes in it! i guess they like it really cold.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Charleigh will drink anything you give her she is addictied to liquid lol...but he regulars are water and milk, very very occasionslly she will have chocolate milk or juice but usually just water, she also loves smoothies made with low cal froz yogurt, froz berries, banana and milk. FYI there was a new report during the week on how much sugar there is in those flavoured waters, there is basically no difference between them and soft drink, i was shocked as i had given Charleigh the flavoured Pumps when she wouldnt drink plain water!!!!|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	My son loves milk, he would drink it all day if I let him.  He also likes water, that's because I drink it alot, so he likes to be like me.  He does like juice, any kind, but I really keep it to a minimum as sugar tends to turn him into his alter ego "the master of disaster".  I will also let him occasionally drink a little tea with me, as it's decaf with no sugar and lots of milk.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My oldest loves cranberry juice, my two littler ones like milk or sierra mist.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my kids love juice and milk.  that is their usual.  special treats are chocolate milk (my daughter just discovered the individual organic chocolate milk boxes) and of course milk shakes.  its something they get with nana.  mommy is too mean to get them.  although maybe i'll make them this weekend.  that would be a nice treat, right?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	doesnt matter what they like ..they drink what  I allow. nothing with high frutose corn syrup..nothing with sugar, colored dyes, or preservatives

(Name her Merci Beaucoup!!)
QvrhmdAtaa	WOW,What a woman!!! Makes me proud to be one. At the same time,WOW what a challenge,makes me glad I am through with child baring. Mine are 25,24,23,20 and 18 now and I'm 45 and it is so great to be able to enjoy my 3 grandchildren (so far) and pick them up with ease still. I feel fortunate to be so young and still be fun for them. I can't imagine missing out on all of this by starting so late in life.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Wow, just, wow. I hope she is in good shape to chase them around.|`|bql2RJzWaa	I commented on the Yahoo page! I said those women are selfish. Do they not realize that they'll be leaving their children's lives WAY too soon- by choice! If they were lonely, they could've adopted a puppy from a shelter. Or even adopted a kid- 40 years ago!|`|Nti8czLvaa	I think it is crazy to have kids at that age, and she shouldn't be, should have thought about it at least 20 years ago.  But we don't know how fit she is, or anything.  My dad had a friend that he worked with, who at 90 years old was running a few miles a day before work, he was a doctor still did surgeries everyday.  He less than a year ago at 100, and did all these things the day he died.  And while I know this is kind of a rare case, you never know she may be like this.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Wow!!! CRAZY!!! Those kids will def have the oldest mommy in their class.      I have no idea how she'll have the energy either. Most older people play with their grandkids then send them home, she won't have that option.|`|AA12089586	Maybe she feels young for her age???|`|wjq8TNgSaa	This isn't the first time I have read that an older woman gave birth to multiples. Personally, at the age of 60, I will readily accept my position as GRANDMOTHER and not so much as a mom to a newborn. But, hey,to each her own. I could never deny a woman the right to be a mother. I hope she is prepared. And I am glad the children are healthy.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	Selfishness.  Plain and simple.  She will die while they are still in school, probably.  Idiocy.|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	I think it's irresponsible and quite selfish.    I'm 61.  My youngest child is 31.  I wonder how much thought this woman gave to how her children will feel if she doesn't make it to 70.  Poor twins.  The most intrinsic fear of young children is abandonment.
bdSm8Mi6aa	Can you go to another teacher's extra help? You should tell your mom that you really confused by your teachers methods  to begin with so why would you go spend more time w/ that fool?      Before the adults judge me 4 this answer-- I once really hated a teacher and just got a weird vibe from him.  My mom wanted me to go to extra help w/ him but i told her i really did not want to go and so i didn't go.  Fast forward to once i graduated from high school and it turns out that the teacher, well... didn't behave too well w/ female students.|`|hQB4TfQFaa	do it after school, after class, or at lunch. you don't have to do it in front of anyone, but if you need help, its very important that you get it!!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Just remember there is no shame in asking for help. Everyone needs help once and a while. ??|`|AA11348344	It doesn't matter if you hate your teacher. What has to be done, has to be done. So would you rather get this done, NOW! Or wait in summer school.|`|0b59c347b366439bc483ccb060f2eee5aa	Go ask for help. I had the same problem back in high school with my trig and asking for help was great! The teachers are there for you to learn and they want you to understand the material. Just do it. You'll be glad you did.
jPxkg7vKaa	It would upset me that my children made irresponsible choices, but I would try to be as supportive as possible.     Saying that though, if my daughter were going to live with me and want me to help her, I'd first lay some ground rules. She would complete high school (even if she had to do it through online coursework) and get a part time job 8 weeks after the birth of her child. She'd pay for most of the child's care herself, provided that I help here and there. I would hope that she would choose to continue on with college, even if it was a class or two. It would be for the good of the child that she can support it.     I would also hope that if my own son got a girl pregnant, he would choose to be an active part in his child's life and help to support the child.     That's all I can say.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	i will be there for them.it thinks that happen in life|`|pcjOQDymaa	I WOULD FREAK OUT!  if it was a girl -   I would make her understand that she is an idiot and would make her take care of it.  if it was a guy -  i would make him understand what an idiot he is too, and make him take care of the baby and girl but not under my roof. i would make him GO AND GET A JOB and take care of his baby.|`|ltst5ELYaa	i would wonder what kind of relationship i have where they cannot tell me.|`|llJERYSXaa	i would be a little upset for not telling me   like can u not trust me or you know  but i would get over it  and then help her / him through it  cause he/ she obviously needs al the help they can get|`|tCU7trAKaa	i would cry if my 16 if my daughter gets preggo at 16... lol naww id kick her bf *** then ground her forever but also Support her threw the pregnancy..   cause if my daughter gets prgnent she is gunna need to grow up pretty fast caush she is keepin it...|`|mBXu5G5saa	I would kick his or her asss out of my house, because i would not raise a kid to have kids, that would not fly in my house please!|`|fvqXiBEVaa	Well I don't have a daughter/son yet lol.    But if I found out I was pregnant, I would know I made a wrong turn in my life and I would react frustrated. What would upset me the most was about the future possibilities it would bring me and how I probably wouldn't be eligible to go to college or anything because I would have to take care of my baby.    I think teens should focus more on school, college, and grades. Not changing diapers.|`|GCm6wlSZaa	As much as I'd be mad as hell, I would still try to help and support my sixteen-year-old as much as possible because he/she is still my child and I love them. However, I will be upset that my child couldn't have came to talk me about something as important as this, but I would still do my best to help my child. Don't get me wrong, I won't be going all of the work for my child because it wasn't all my fault and they should deal the consequences of becoming a mother/father. Oh yeah, I'd be realllllyy mad about becoming a grandmother!|`|pHIUUnOiaa	WOW if that was my kid i would kick them out that diguistes me i mean why on earth would you be that immature and selfish to have sex? i would be upset that i could not raise them up to be a mature person!|`|UA8zGGTsaa	Be very surprised, since I don't have a daughter.    But if I did;  I would react very angrily at first, and it would take me a few days to cool down. After all, now that she is pregnant, their's not much I could do other than accept it and move forward.    Once I cooled down, I would sit down with her and her boyfriend and make a plan. Financially, spiritually, academically, socially and mentally.    The part that would upset me the most would be that she felt as if she couldn't trust me enough to tell me.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Id hit the ROOF!    It would upset me that they didnt feel like they could tell me|`|Z7dShLRLaa	I would beat her with a belt on the legs and on her back.|`|GxZVZLlHaa	Well I'm 15 and pregnant and both my parents just died. From my point of view thogh, what I would want them to do is not be mean! They could give me a nice long lecture, I deserve that, but not in a mean voice! I'm going through a hard enough time, I don't need my guardians hating me too.|`|ZkR1Y2fTaa	I would be upset because my child didn't confide in me. hopefully my kids would know that I would be very disappointed with their decision, but they should also know that I would help them get through the situation.|`|WxSQA1ZKaa	I'd freak out. I'd be upset that she might be ruining her future, and i'd be worried about how someone so young would be able to take care of a baby, especially if she and the guy aren't in a committed relationship. Also I'd be kicking myself for not giving the girl/ guy 'the talk' or at least condoms (i'm not accusing, but thats what I would do personally). And I'd be sad that my son/daughter wouldn't be able to talk to me about it before it was too late.|`|3MmVWDT3aa	If it was my daughter:    1. I would scream and jump out the window  2. I would ground her- and make her have the baby  3. It would upset me that I had the trust in my daughter that she will gain back  little by little|`|nsAFlZhIaa	I (having anger issues) would leave the house, go to a hotel, and stay there for a few days so I do not kill him... I would then go back once I was calm, and ask him "why". I would be happy to be a grandfather, and support him, and her. I would just be shocked for a few days.|`|6EA2VKXnaa	1st i would try my hardest to remain calm and not say anything rash.  I would make sure they were planning on having the child.  I would be disappointed in them not telling me, however i would try extremely hard not to say something rash. It would upset me the most was that my son or daughter had failed to say no.|`|5i1J2RLLaa	I would be angry, frustrated, and extremely dissapointed in both myself and my child. Because I failed as a parent because I didn't raise my child the way they should have been raised. 4-5 months along is even worse because they didn't tell me and kept something so big from me.|`|KK7bnIP0aa	I would sit and wonder what I did wrong as a parent and what I could have did to prevent it. If my daughter got pregnant, I would be there for her and help her with everything, but I wouldn't wait on her hand and foot but I would support her.    If my son got a girl pregnant, this would be different. I would be VERY angry at him...I dont know what I would do...|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	I would be most upset that my son wouldn't come to me and tell me, so I could try to help him through it.    I would tell him to step up to what you did, and be ready to help out in every way that he can.    I would try to stay clam, but i would probably cry a little just from shock. I would explain to him how irresponsible it was of him.|`|l1STgPyRaa	i would be thinking that when they got home there would be a LOT OF TALKING.   If I was the girls Parents, my first concern would be has she seen a doctor? had her blood test done for STD's, had the unborn child looked at is it healthy. Then i would be asking what the hell it was that she could not have come and talked to myself or her mother! why she had not been using the pill and condoms, after all if she had said that she was going to be sexually active then she would have been given all that as soon as she told us of it. she would know by that age also that there was a way to talk to myself and her mother where anything could be said and no punishment could happen as a result of what is said (within reason IE not confessing to murder or something) but really the first and for most thing is the safety of the child     if it was a boy:- then again why the hell did he not use the condoms... was his sexual health OK and how does he now intend to support the child and mother (if he decided to stay with her) but ether way he would be supporting the child i would see to that. and again why could he not have told myself or his mother before hand.     but for each i would be disappointed that they did not tell us and felt that they could not have told us.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I would be shocked, depressed and confused. I would also be angry my 16 year old would do this. In the end I would make her give the baby up for adoption. There would be no way she would keep the baby.|`|YJi8CZnNaa	I'd beat the living hell out of them, they will stay virgin until their 18 if they want to remain a good relationship with their father.    But if it does happen, first beat the living hell out off them, then breakdown and cry while explaining that they just f*cked up their entire future if they don't choose abortion. If they choose it, i still take care of them and love them. If they don't choose it, they're on their own.|`|MeED6WtFaa	they can stay, but i'm not supporting them, they need to learn.|`|CuLvgckjaa	Well if it was why my daughter I would tell her "Oh Honey were going to get through this no matter what and we will support you all the way and we love you very much and we promise to be supportive and take care of this baby ourselves and I think it would be great to have another baby in the house with you leaving for college in a few years."    And if it was my son I would tell him "How could you get a girl pregnant?"  What's her name? Dial the girls parent's number and talk to them. Tell them how sorry we are that our son did that to her and we promise to keep the baby for as long as possible as soon as its born and we will pay all of the future expenses.|`|APN67ZUqaa	i would be upset that he she didn't tell me, but i would try to talk to him her to find out why. it was most likely because they thought you would be verry mad, you need to just except it because its already happened and you can't change it.|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	I would be so upset. I would wonder why she/he had not came and told me about it... It would break my heart that they couldn't trust me enough to tell me, but I would be very pissed off. I know I would be expected to take care of the baby for the most part. I can help as much as I can, but I'm not that child's parent. I really don't know what I would do if I was in that situation. I would have so many mixed feelings, but I would have to go on with it.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	hmm if i found out my 16 year old daughter was pregnant I would go get a coat hanger out of my closet =)    nah, idk what I would do unless i was actually in that situation|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	I would beat the **** out of them! Then make plans for adoption. And tell my kid to get out of the house.
AyHo8rnKaa	the worse thing is some teens don't even think about it before they go out and have unprotected s e x, and when they end up with babies, they think about abortion.  it is really really stupid and immature like you said. it's a shame.|`|WGgl974Raa	Well it depend on the story of the person. See I'm 8mths right now and I'm only 19 years old and i been with my boyfriend for 2 years not saying that makes it ok  but i work,i have my own house and so do my boyfriend and we can take care of are self which we do. I feel if you take care a your self and don't just THINK they can like some young ppl these days then i believe it's no problem but only if your over 18 under i think its flat out wrong and nasty >|`|0T6ympIvaa	I agree irresponsible to bring a baby into the world when the mother in father are still kind of unsure of them self and are still learning about things in the world crazy even though its not right i will prefer abortion its a sin to have unmarried sex then again to bring a bay in the world you have your whole life in front of you don't waste it|`|OLy54IDOaa	every body acts different with everything. yes its not the right thing to do but it does happen and its can be a mistake. but if people handle it the right way then thats a different story. i have repect for them. but people who just have there parents do Everything for the baby is irresponible,|`|eunQQfUqaa	I think that having a baby when you are a teen is way too young. I'm not saying that i'm very old-fasioned, because i am a teen, but you should wait until you are older. When you get older then you will be more responsible, but i dont wanna say that you cant have sex until you get married.|`|XstDtxuUaa	I think your right.    I find that teenage pregnancy is something that isn't "Cool" & is very serious issue.    I believe if some of these girls would take the time to stop & think about their actions and maybe think about if their ready to have sex then they should learn about all the risks & STDS .And learn how to use condoms & birth control pills properly.    Then again it is also the parents of these teenage girls to talk openly & honestly about sex & all the risks that come with such things & not just either ignore the subject when it's brought up.     Nor just tell them that abstinence is the only way & not give them the information concerning sex & pregnancy.    I mean it couldn't hurt to study up on sex & pregnancy by just doing some research at your local bookstore,ask your doctor to give you booklets on the matter while asking as many questions as possible.    Hell,even going on the internet & Googling: "Human reproduction" or "facts about sex" would be rather informative & helpful if you need some information on the facts & myths concerning the subject.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I think if a teenager (over 16) gets pregnant by accident, then it's acceptable, and they have my sympathy. If they are under 16 and got pregnant by accident, I find it disgusting. Child sex is revolting. If they had sex with no protection, I consider it very stupid and goes to show they weren't mature enough, since they weren't responsible enough. If they got pregnant on purpose, they are beyond stupid and need a kick in the ***. ??|`|r39EDGhPaa	Well, having sex young is both immature and irresponsible, but some teens have sex using condoms and birth control and still end up pregnant(i still think they weren't being responsible.. but at least they tried, unlike some morons.)    I have nothing against teen pregnancy, generally.. but some of the teen parents out there..whew..   I think if you decide you're going to have and keep a child, you are agreeing to care for that child 100%.  I hate how the grandparents end up being burdened sometimes, because the hospital bills and tons of other things need to get paid for somehow :|  It isn't as bad if you're old enough to get a job, because then you could help out.  I am kind of on the fence with this one.    It's a bad thing, but sh*t happens.  I never feel sorry for them.|`|bBSAFsrhaa	it depends.. i have two friends who are teen mothers and there are such responsible parents. i think in the end it comes down to the children if they are cared for and loved then that's all that matters.|`|pJeFpC7qaa	I guess its their fault but once its happened why beat urself up over it?    its happened & u can't go back and change it so just get through it and give the baby the best home possible|`|giRRCXU4aa	Well, i'm 19 and i'm 32 weeks pregnant. I have plenty of money, I live in a nice house, drive a nice car, have a great job and a wonderfully supportive family. I didn't plan on getting pregnant but i'm so excited about my son. It has already changed my life so much. I don't think it's irresponsible if you handle it in a mature way. You shouldn't place judgement on teen pregnancy as one situation because every situation is different. Sure, the girls that get pregnant that pass their kids off on their parents and could care less are immature, but some of us actually try.
GYoNyoWtaa	If you're having a baby, they insert a needle with a plastic sheath (catheter), and then they withdrawl the needle leaving the catheter in place. The correct placement is important in how well it will work, it must be in the epidural space around the nerves of the spine. They then run medication into it just like they do an IV. It is important that you do exactly as your anesthesiologist says in order to help him/her get the best placement. The medication is similar to what you get when the dentist numbs your mouth for a filling. They can control how much medications you get, from completely numb to slightly numb.       No one can truly tell you how bad it hurts or if it hurts at all. Because we all have different bodies, and some of us handle pain worse or better then others..Just depends on the person.      But honey at 14 you have plenty of time not to worry about it. and trust me you will eventually want children and won't care about the pain...it just comes with a level of maturity    until then good luck & take care =)|`|JgpyfuuWaa	The medication delivered by the epidural is usually a combination of a local anesthetic and a narcotic. Local anesthetics block sensations of pain, touch, movement, and temperature, and narcotics blunt pain without affecting your ability to move your legs. Used together, they provide good pain relief with less loss of sensation in your legs and at a lower total dose than you'd need with just one or the other.    I felt no pain when I had an epidural, just pressure.  Without it, I imagine the pain would be pretty severe.|`|AA12016833	Ok to make it simple. An epidural makes your vaginal area numb so you don't feel any pain (maybe some pressure) when you push out the baby. without an epidural. The pain is severe. There's no number you can put on the pain of natural child birth. But its all worth it when you see those little chubby cheeks. If you are that scared, you can also choose to have a c-section :)|`|QVg9KB1vaa	When I was your age I did not want to have children because I was scared of the pain.  I now have 2 beautiful boys and would like 2 more children.  I had an epidural with both deliveries.  I didn't feel any pain (only pressure) once i got the epidural.  Before the epidural the pain was a 9 or 10.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I had an epidural. For me, the pain before I got it was wayyyyyy of the scale as i could never imagine the intensity before. I can belive it must be comparable to a pain when your limb gets severed. Hurts worse than anything I experienced before. After I got epidural, I felt 0 pain. None. Next time I am getting epidural again, thank God for this option.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	An epidural makes your lower half numb and is supposed to not make you feel contractions. When I had my son, the epidural was GREAT. It wore off enough so I could feel it right as I was starting to push so I had complete control. Back when I had my daughter in October they missed the first time so they had to do it again, then it ended being a one-sided epidural so my left leg was numb until almost 10pm (got the epidural at 10am) and I felt everything on my right side within 45 minutes of getting it.     I must admit I was happier with half the pain than all of it lol. My sister's was too strong for her first child so she couldn't feel anything at all...they had to manually help push my nephew out but it went fine with her other 2 kids.     I had some pretty bad lower back pain for about a month after having my daughter...I'd literally get stuck bending down to tie my shoes and I'm pretty sure it was from the epidural but I'd still get another one if I ever have another baby.     Most people are afraid of the needle they use but it's not really as bad as it looks. They give you a local to numb the area first so you don't even feel it. The worst part was actually peeling off the tape that held the catheter in place lol.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Epidurals prevent signals of pain from going through the nerves in your spinal cord to your brain. Your brain isn't getting the message that something down there really hurts. You pretty much have no sensation.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	a high 10 without it and an epidural numbs you from waist down so you dont feel the pain but sometimes it does not work as well as they are supposed to or wear off sooner.|`|l9jVMVBBaa	epidural makes a happy delivery. lol. i was numb from the chest down, and it helped me actually sleep through my labor. they almost had to take it out for me to push.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	An epidural is a little needle that goes into your back.    It numbs you from the bottom of ur chest down. People can experience different levels of pain with an epidural. Some work really well and you feel no pain, some dont work so well and you get breakthough or patchy pain.    When you are pregnant u can discuss this with ur midwife|`|WG941bbDaa	I'm not sure exactly how they work...But I got one when I had my son 4 months ago and I couldn't have imagined not getting one.  I wish I would have waited a little longer because mine wore off when I started pushing.  Having a child is seriously painful..lol.  It's something you will never forget.  Just don't rush into having kids too early.  Live your life..have fun...and take good care of yourself.  The better you take care of yourself the easier your pregnancy will be in the future.  The epideral is a big needle that's given to you in your spine.  Sounds bad...but trust me the pain from labor is worse...lol|`|MQ34YW28aa	numbs you from the waist down so you don't feel your contractions anymore. but when you start pushing you have the pressure of the baby 'there' and you will feel that and the epidural can't do anything about that really. But if you didn't have the epidural you'd be in a lot of pain, trust me!!! I'm soooo glad I got the epidural, those contractions HURT, plus ended up with a csection so I needed it anywase.|`|4GL7CRebaa	it just nums you body from waist and down so the delivery wont be so hard on you becasue of the pain of having a child is so harrrrrrdddd and horrible i ahve one she is 6 yrs old and am on my second one am 8  months right now honey take your time and go to school i had my daughter when i was 16 so dont make the same mistake enjo life have fun !!!!!!!!!1|`|aka2d6Wiaa	you don't feel anything with an epidural, all i felt was the pressure of my baby coming out but it didn't hurt at all! now with out it it is so much pain. i was in labor for 19 hours and for 11 long hours i had no medicine  so i felt every single contraction but as soon as i got the epidural i felt like i had just entered heaven!! i recommend epidural to all expecting mothers out there it really works!
Xrwvu5Uraa	ok it doesn't need to be exactly when you ovulate that you can get pregnant. you can get pregnant at any time. you should go to your doctor if you miss your period. there is ALWAYS a chance you could be pregnant if you had unprotected sex. good luck.|`|yUP05L2Iaa	any time a penis goes in side a vagina and sperm comes out without a condom or birth control there is a high chance of pregnancy|`|VS8mactUaa	If its unprotected, then the chances are pretty good, it is possible to get pregnant pretty much anyday without protection,  not just your "fertile days". Good Luck To You|`|SiSplXXsaa	Unless you're wearing a rubber properly, then your odds are high enough to consider wearing a rubber properly.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Well if you aren't on any birth control method and not using protection. Then that always ups the risk for pregnancy        Be more careful next time =)|`|AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period, and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.    Anytime you have unprotected sex you are at risk for getting pregnant.|`|XfzgA03baa	it means u did it before without the  use of condom|`|66dAMlktaa	actually quite probable but it all depends on the work of fate...|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Are you being serious?  The chance is really high. Sperm live inside the woman for around five days.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	it depends. but if you weren't ovulating at the time you had sex then the chances are not as big.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	3 days, fair chance.  6 Days, impossible.      If you don't want to be pregnant, take precautions.  Not the rhythm method!|`|9op65iQVaa	pretty good chance.|`|qBJLuCO0aa	well it takes about 24hours for the sperm to reach the egg so it could be possible...|`|fDWiGXENaa	why not just be safe and use protection? why risk it|`|bSEuEvCSaa	were you smart enough to use protection?|`|GEOuOFvNaa	Depends if you used a condom or birth control.|`|EuCF5rp8aa	there's always a chance you could get prego. just stay protected and your chances are always less.|`|rVeHVNPQaa	Yes um actually it can|`|mgiZ0bJ1aa	in my P.E class the teacher told me sperm can only last inside a womans body for 2-3 days if it dont fertilise the egg|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	I believe sperm can live inside of you a maximum of 3 days, and although there is a chance, not all of the sperm will be alive at the end of the three days, so your chances are significantly reduced.    There is always one in a million though... wait 2 weeks. Take a test.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Still pretty good chance.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	I don't understand you have 3-6 days after you ovulate or before? No matter what there is always a chance you can still get pregnant after having unprotected sex.|`|ipVGmNUCaa	The chances are:      * 10 percent of participants were fertile at day 6      * One-half were fertile between days 11 and 14      * 10 percent were fertile at day 22  Hope that helps|`|xtVpZuh5aa	not likely but still possible... sperm live in your body for up to 3 days....|`|no9N3zjMaa	Sperm can live in the body for like 3-5 days so it's possible|`|004852a905529110fe5b732be4895189aa	Modus and Reeba are right.  If you weren't ovulating yet, then the chances of you being pregnant are very slim. Use a pregnancy testing kit. If you miss your period, then see your gyno.|`|EygDAZuFaa	every lady is different, take a test. you have 2 ovs. some women ovalate well into thier gestation. conception wasn't 3-6 days ago, it was 3-6 days ago. good luck!!!|`|B7FL0rdqaa	The female produces eggs, which travel from your ovaries, down the fallopian tube and into your uterus then are generally expelled from the body by means of menstration.  The male sperm, can fertilize the egg while it is still travelling down your fallopian tube, which could be anywhere from 2-4 days before you would consider yourself "ovulating" so you basically have a 50% chance that the sperm fertilized your egg. Even if you menstrate after unprotected sex, that does not mean you are not pregnant, 4% of women experience light to medium bleeding for the first 5 weeks of pregnancy, so your best bet would be to get yourself tested, and use contraception if you're worried about getting pregnant!
zmbeIbx7aa	when the sperm reaches the egg you have a fertilized egg you do not become pregnant until that egg implants into the uterus lining. Personally I think you are pregnant from the time the sperm meets the egg but most say different. Yes you can still get pregnant from sperm from 3-5 days after unprotected sex. That is how long sperm can live in the vaginal area depending on the ph level of the woman's vagina.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	after O the sperm gets in to the ovum to make it a fertilized egg, after that the egg gets implanted on the uterus wall ,which is called implantation.after all these process are perfect, yes, u get pregnant
e7uUfLsqaa	I have one child and that is good for me.  I don't want more for a few reasons.  First, I had terrible post-partum depression.  He takes up alot of my time and has some learning disablities and I wouldn't want to take time away from him for another child, and I own my own business now and it is going great and I don't want to go back to babies (he is 12 now).   Also (yes, theres more), I am 31 and didn't want a baby much later than 30.    But that's just me - to each his/her own! but i'm happy with my one awesome son!|`|qcjAg3yOaa	i have one now and i do want more when we feel we're financially ready.  I really thought i was going to be settled with one but i've talked to ppl who grew up with no siblings and most say they wished their parents had more. I grew up 21 mnths apart from my older brother and we were like best friends.. never fought always kept each other entertained, so i know i want my son to have the same experience  growing up.    I heard about the lady who had 8 kids too.. she also had 6 already at home.. plus shes a single mother... man o man shes got a lot on her hands.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	I had 5 siblings and I loved it - something different to expect everyday and I had a lot of fun with them growing up. My hubby is an only child and he said he grew up miserable, his parents were old fashioned and never spent any time with him playing football or taking him out anywhere.   We have one child together so far and we definitely want more, even if it is only one more, atleast my daughter will never be lonely and resent us later in life like my hubby does with his parents.|`|TBbf0dQZaa	i was the only child...no siblings...very few friends...it didnt really bother me at the time but i feel the isolation now...!!!  i feel a couple shud at least have 2 children..no matter what...a single child feels isolated unless of course the parents understand his/her heart and mind totally...|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I was an only child and growing up wasn't lonely. My best friend lived right down the road :)    I have one baby and another on the way. I had a horrible birth experience with my son, had a missed miscarriage (not very common) with my second pregnancy, and now I am pregnant again but the baby might not make it due to a subchorionic hemorrhage (only present in 1.3% of all pregnancies.. lucky me). I have wanted another baby ever since I first laid eyes on my first :)    Now, on to octuplet mom...    I feel very sorry for those children. 14 children under the age of 7 is just ridiculous and unnatural. Humans aren't meant to have litters! Giving those kids the attention they each need is beyond a full time job in and of itself, not counting the care they need on top of it. Plus they don't have fathers :( Its very sad that she would have such a large number of kids to make up for her past feelings of isolation. The children are the ones who are going to suffer. Very Very Sad.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	I am the oldest of three siblings, and I loved having a little brother and little sister. I would have been sad without them. And I had twins, so I'll never know what it is like to only have one child, but if I had only one I would want more.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	I have one son and will have at least one more. I want a big family if we can afford it but I came from a big family so it's not because of isolation.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	I am not an only child, so I cannot answer your first question, but to comment on this women's mental health, I would like to say that she had these children for very selfish reasons. She had 14 children to make up for HER emotional issues? Unfortunately she now has 14 children under 7 that she cannot support financially, cannot give her time to (anyone with even 2-3 children can tell you how difficult it can be because small children all need their parent's attention), and cannot give her emotional support to, because she herself is obviously unstable and has deep resentment and emotional baggage! She obviously didn't think about the neglect and isolation that her 14 children will feel. (BTW- this woman has been seeing a psychiatrist since she has been 14 for this "obsession") I have one son and I am now pregnant with baby number 2. I hope my children can be friends and confidants. I feel like there are things you can talk about with your brothers and sisters that you couldn't talk to your mom or dad about. I think it is nice to have a playmate right in your own house, and I do think that children learn patience, and sharing, and other values from having siblings.  I do not think only children will grow up with baggage like this woman otherwise there would be a lot more crazy women like this out there! If you give your child all your love and make an effort to encourage them to make friends and not isolate themselves, then they will turn out fine! Many children do just fine as only children. You can see the time and energy their parents have invested in them and they are usually very interesting and social little people! I think it is much worse to have way more than you can handle- you can't turn that decision around!
ZVUrLZpXaa	They did ...but both are over age 80 and suffering from dementia now:*(  I have my happy memories always,though...|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	OMG! that's so sweet. no, i am not that lucky. my dad passed away and my mom never does anything for my birthday. i never even had a birthday party growing up,so cherish every moment of it|`|G9ywiLqvaa	happy birthday, diane!  :)    my mom died when i was 14 and my dad died 4 years ago.  so in my entire adult life, my dad would just call then to greet me.  well, we live far so his call was special enough for me.  but of course, i haven't been getting any phone calls since then. :(    but my husband makes up for my loss.  he makes all my birthdays special, complete with serenaders and bouquets upon bouquets of flowers being sent to my office year after year.  and when i come home, he would've already rehearsed our 5 and 7 year old sons to sing me happy birthday while carrying a tiny cake.  lol!    my boys' most memorable birthday parties?  we've still to work on those for this year.  their past parties were just kinda run-of-the-mill kiddie parties.  but this year, my sweet hubby and i are planning something extra special for both of them. :)|`|6e541cf93eb873a02de583d69ccab728aa	No my mother doesn't have the need to make it special anymore I guess. I think it's b/c I am married and figures it's up to my hubby to do that! but it would be nice if she did. You are super blessed with wonderful parents.|`|XHkPiDssaa	My birthdays arent as special now that Im older. My Mom usually cooks me my favorite dinner and gets me a present, but thats about it. No more birthday parties! My best birthday was when I was turning 5 years old. It was at my Grandparents pizza shop, and they had miniature golf and batting cages there and all of my friends from school came. I hope that I can have birthdays like that for my daughter when she is a little older. She just turned 3 and we had a Spongebob themed party, because she is currently obsessed with that show!! We had games for the little kids and goody bags but at this age I think she is too little to remember,|`|M9wAOlk3aa	no they dont   not even so much as a child your very lucky and blessed   happy birthday
lhn1wNoeaa	yes i think it should be on the same day.I am not sure of it.If so it might chance 1 or 2 days that's it.|`|hHEMhPZyaa	It is not likely to be off that much. 14 days after the first day of a period is the norm.
hcqNXUH5aa	Bryan Joseph 7/10  I typically don't like "y"s thrown into names, but... this spelling is kind of cute.  A character in Summers at Castle Auburn is named Bryan and also spelled this way.

Bryan is Brian spelt a complicated way. Joseph is okay for a middle name but kind of boring.    Daniel is a name i love (and the nickname 'Dan'!!)

I really like the name Bryan, but pairing it with a J name, with the opportunity for them to be called B.J. just isn't cool to me!|`|a08xszn3aa	Bryan Joseph maybe like 8  And Daniel Steven like 1    Daniel is to much of a common name   Bryan is different    Kye is a name we are considering Jacob and Callab are nice as well in my opinion anyways.|`|G6p7QSedaa	Daniel Steven 6  very nice name  Bryan Joseph 4  not to crazy about the name Bryan|`|BbAlXgLGaa	Bryan Joseph=9  comment:   i suggest you to pair it(Bryan) with Nathaniel  Daniel Steven=8  comment:   like it but i prefer Bryan Nathaniel        ....|`|mVPBkUWSaa	I really like the name Daniel. :)|`|9a2MdcuSaa	very cute|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	I like them both.

Wow we have to pay for our insurance ($516 a month-2people) and still have to pay for prescriptions.|`|ltst5ELYaa	quit complaining. at least YOU dont have to pay FULL cost like the rest of us. Its TEN FREAKING DOLLARS. i have to pay 60.|`|iCLGHUdQaa	It's not free if your insurance says you have a copay.  And your copay may vary depending on the type of drug you are getting.  If you're unsure, look at your insurance card or find your handbook.    Most people pay WAY more than $10 for a copay - you should be happy to only have to pay that.  Most people have to pay in full for their medications which can be hundreds or thousands of dollars a month!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Nothing is free, especially prescriptions, I have to pay a  20 dollar co pay for mine and my daughter prescriptions, and sometimes a lot more if my insurance does not cover it.

If you got a 79 or so on one, it won't really raise your grade. If you got a B on some of them, then your grade would rise, and if you got As on all of them, you should get an 80 or close to it.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	If you are worried about alcohol in your breast milk try out http://www.milkscreen-moms.com, they are little strips that you dip in the milk that will detect the alcohol.   A general rule of thumb I have heard if you do not want to spend the money on the strips . . .  your liver can clean 1oz of hard liquor an hour not to drink more than that( in an hour that is).   Another rule of thumb I've heard is if you can't drive you shouldn't breastfeed.  I don't know which is correct but if you truly want to be sure buy the strips.  Work out when you are comfortable to do so but stop if you start to cramp.   Hope I've helped.|`|3klIx1Egaa	you dont need to pump unless your child will be feeding during the time you feel the alcohol.. once the alcohol is out of your system, its no longer in your breast milk. You are fine to have a few glasses of wine! and working out, when you feel comfortable and able too.|`|MQ34YW28aa	If you have a glass of wine it wont hurt to breastfeed the baby like 3 hours after you have it, but if you end up having more then you gotta pump and dump for 24 hours. I also had a csection and i'm 9 weeks PP and I started around 6 weeks with exercising. Still get sore, just try not to overdue it like i did, just take it slow and gradually get yourself into a reutine. Congrat's with your baby!!! It's a great thing. :)

zmbeIbx7aa	I found out with my first I tested with a hpt 18 days past ovulation that is 30 days after the last day of my period. With my second I tested 16 days past ovulation the is 28 days after the last day of my period.

If you aren't mentally and emotionally prepared. You will burn out quickly. Just remember,you can't save everyone,but save the ones you can.    If you want to work there you have to have experience,these lives are so very fragile. Most places won't take anyone who isn't at least a registered nurse,and then you will expected to have that specialty training.|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	I don't think I would be able to handle it.

q2t9nJmsaa	Congrats!    If your Doctor can't work out your due date due to irregular periods or if you cant remember the date of your last period then your Doc will likely order a 'Dating Scan' which is an ultrasound usually done at about 7 weeks to work out your due date.    After that you'll have another one at around 12 weeks and if all is well then you'll have one more at 19 weeks. You may need more if there are any issues but this is the norm.    Hope that helps    Good Luck :)|`|BWL2P49oaa	We have them done at about 12 weeks just to verify due date, then again at the end of the second trimester to see about size and placement of placenta (we don't look for sex, but you can get one after week 22, I think)|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Should be 8 weeks. But every doctor is different. You can always ask for one.       CONGRATULATIONS|`|vGHaYp6Naa	ok so most of them are done as soon as you find out. pretty much around 7 or 8 wks. maybe even sooner. i didnt get my first one until i was 16 weeks.|`|iiUJHYNeaa	10 weeks along|`|Eqln1jmNaa	i had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks and 6 days... normally they like to have it before your 8 weeks pregnant
AA11106484	It may be best to get one from his dentist. I grind my teeth too, and have tried every kind of night guard that you get at the pharmacy and boil and form yourself. They just never fit well and are uncomfortable. Although with your child at that age, losing his teeth will require constantly changing the night guard and that could be expensive. I would still talk to his dentist to find out what's best, and I highly recommend getting him used to using one early. I didn't start until I was in my 20s and still struggle to have the discipline to use it every night. I have done so much (expensive!) damage to my teeth and crowns from grinding!    ETA: If you do get one from the dentist, make sure to ask for the soft kind. I got the hard type one time and it was REALLY uncomfortable. I paid $200 and didn't wear it a single time!
qnCPWStoaa	I am a medic and recently responded to a call for a 6 week old not breathing. We tried everything we could and the baby didn't live. Mom stated that the last time she saw the baby breathing, she was in bed with him, breastfeeding and she feel asleep. cause of death? Suffocation! Mom rolled over on him!   She doesn't smoke (I smoke and she was outside the hospital so I figured if she smoked she'd need one, so I offered she said she doesn't smoke) she wasn't fat (maybe weighed 110, after having a baby) No signs of drinking and when asked stated she doesn't drink. The baby also showed signs of trying to stuggle. Why would a parent even risk it? IMO it is very dangerious!!!  This is the 2nd call i have had for the same thing, in 5 yrs, in a town of 1000!!!|`|dDJiuoOEaa	i have never herd of that if u are a mother u know your new born is beside u so u know not to roll over mothers Instinct but i have never no-wed any one who did sleep with there new born ether good luck|`|AA11785060	While there are some stories where someone rolled over on their baby, probably most babies in the world sleep with one or both parents when young.  Like most other mammals.  Our older kids slept with us when they were infants, primarily because we were poor and had little heat, so to keep the kids warm, they slept with us. Just like millions of families around the world in cooler climates, or where living space is at a premium.  Young generally will sleep with the mother since she can nurse the child repeatedly while in bed.    Just a crazy 20th century notion that babies need to be put in separate beds and isolated in another room of the house, put to bed in tears.  No wonder our kids are so messed up today. Got rejection from the moment they were born!|`|bL0G6EGNaa	yes, you may roll over on it and smother it. also if it becomes a habit the child may grow to be 13 and still sleeping in your bed.. which is kinda creepy/unhealthy.|`|NVrLg3Bjaa	Yes, you could smother the child.  Seems like common sense to me.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Yes it's dangerous because there is the chance of suffocating your child in your sleep. I am a very light sleeper (which I know is not a good excuse) and I still co-slept with both of my kids though.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Co-sleeping is 100% safe if done correctly. No heavy blankets, excess pillows, parents not on drugs, no smokers in bed, no obese parents and no heavy sleepers. If you can pass all of them then there is no reason NOT to sleep with your baby. It builds a special bond. Most time parents are the ones being abused by co-sleeping ex: getting kicked, pushed, head butted|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	That is a very popular debate. I personally don't bring my daughter to bed with me but if my fiance wakes her up at 430am leaving for work then I bring her into our bed and she falls right back to sleep. My 6 yr old son just now started coming into my bed after he leaves but he always used to sleep in his own crib/bed.    My sister on the other hand has 3 kids and all of them got used to co-sleeping very quickly. She has pretty much nipped it in the bud now but it took a lot of work. Her kids are 9, 4 and 1 1/2 and until a few months ago she'd wake up with ALL 3 kids in bed with her and her husband. Talk about a crowded bed lol.    As far as the smothering issue...I am sure it happens but most people say they have that "instict" not to roll over. The few times my daughter is in bed with me I don't think I even move when I am sleeping.|`|tJa60S4Taa	yes, you might smother the baby|`|qHykYLQ6aa	Only if you are an active sleeper and might roll over onto the baby, or if there is not really enough room for you and baby, and anyone else that might be with you.  It's safer to co-sleep with a bed you pull up to the side of your bed.|`|tCU7trAKaa	oh my yes it is very|`|iXt3erseaa	It depends. If the bed is safe (i.e. a large mattress on the floor so baby doesn't roll off, there is no possibility of the baby getting stuck between the bed and the wall, etc.) and the mattress is firm enough, then it can be ok. There should not be excessive pillows or heavy blankets / duvets that can smother the baby, and the parent must not be under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, and there must be no smoking in bed. But many families share a bed with the baby, esp nursing mothers do this, and it's quite safe.|`|iC0vn2Nkaa	Yes! you could roll over and suffocate your baby. Put your baby in the crib to sleep.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	it can be a positive. i was told by a lactation consultant that when you are breathing on your baby and they breath it in that it sends signals to their brain letting them know it is not fresh air. so they cant get into that DEEP sleep... but you can smother them.|`|MQ34YW28aa	I think so, I could never do that with my son. Both me and my husband are hard sleepers and would be afraid of rolling on him or something. Never would take the chance of doing that.|`|AA10959932	No. Many parts of the world there is only one bed. I've slept in the bed with all  my children. You don't sleep as heavily if the baby is in the bed with you.     Plus if you are nursing, its sooo much easier.|`|SKlBAtPjaa	Yes, because you never know when you're gonna roll over in your sleep.|`|x1FyqVKLaa	Yah you could easily smother the baby.|`|ytl2PONXaa	My sister did it with her kids and they seemed fine.    But I guess it depends on who you are. I can't even sleep with my dog in my bed without kicking him about 10 times a night because I move around so much.|`|NGk5IrWWaa	if you roll around frequently while you sleep  and you cant use thick blankets. better without blanket onyl a sheet.|`|V6slDthdaa	Only if you're drunk, under heavy medication or very overweight. Other than that the chances of "smothering" your baby are quite slim.|`|pVpQuWXzaa	Oh yea you could suffocate it and you might crush it under your body. Please get it's on crib. please.|`|jvVyteMzaa	Yes! There are tons of reasons why you should NOT do that-  1. The baby could get smothered.  2. Baby could fall off the bed causing all sorts of damage  3. Baby could suffocate  4. Baby could get trapped between headboard and bed- not good!  5. You could roll over him/her  6. Just don't do it! A crib is much better. If you want your baby close, put a safe bassinet near your bed.|`|9xBtHTdCaa	yes it could be if your baby is three or four and still sleeping with you. You should try putting them in their own bed and stay beside them until they go to sleep and eventually you will be able toget them to go to bed by themselves.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It can be. "Google co-sleeping. "|`|AA12025153	Thats how my nephew was accidently killled 2 yrs ago on my birthday. They couldnt afford a crib and even if they could they did not have the room for one. My brother was in a deep sleep, rolled over..and well, smothered the baby..  It was a horrible accident and I would hate to have any others have to deal with such a trajedy..  We all are still dealing today..the sad thing is they do not live close and I never got to meet my nephew..just his gravesite and photos|`|QikvnTnqaa	Um. YES! You could roll over on the baby in your sleep. That's something most people can think of, isn't it?|`|Ms8b2kISaa	It is dangerous....you can roll over on them and hurt them or smother them! They do sell little baby beds that fit in or on your bed, so that they can sleep there safely. Here's one on a good site I shop on a lot. http://www.onestepahead.com/catalog/prod...|`|f0vdBz2iaa	This is a rather controversial question... it really depends on who you ask.    I'd read some actual articles about co-sleeping before making your final decision.  There are some other options to partially co-sleep, too, which is safer - like having a co-sleeper bed (basically their own little bed that attaches to your bed - it's open on the bed side, but has sides all around the others).  I did this with my two kids (who are now 2 & 5).  Check out the links below too (and google co-sleeping).|`|6fiYhtACaa	Pretty much only in our culture. Most other cultures sleep with their babies. You make an interesting point about sleep-deprivation and I'm sure that may be a contributing factor, but so does obesity, smoking, drug use. I'd say that any with- it, normal, conscientious mother probably wouldn't smother their child. You have that innate sense that the baby is in bed with you and you sleep accordingly. My mom slept with all of my siblings and I (nine of us total) and she never even had a close call. But there are always those people that drink or are over-tired or stack the bed with comforters and their babies, alot of times preemies, end up suffocating. So, naturally they advise everyone to stop the practice of bed-sharing to spare the poor kids of numskull parents.|`|Pl7VLWhzaa	True there is some danger, but there are also cons to not sleeping with the baby.    Basically co-sleeping is natural, it's what we evolved to do and it allows one to more easily comfort the baby during the night. In addition, because the baby is comforted they tend to sleep more on their back (babies like sleeping on their tummies because they associate force on their stomach with being tummy to tummy with the mother which is the most comforting position). Co-sleeping does NOT however mean sleeping with a sibling, also as long as you are not going to sleep drunk or high you should be able to realize when the baby is close to you.    Co-sleeping doesn't necessarily mean sleeping in the same bed as the baby. As long as the baby is close by (within arms reach), they will still reap many of the same benefits but without the dangers (i.e. crib right next to the bed)
bcZSIphUaa	Please try and relax and stop stressing.    You can't do anything about it IF you are miscarrying.    However, by relaxing and thinking positively and looking after yourself you can reduce the stress on your body which has to help.    I have PCOS and I'm undergoing fertility treatment...I haven't conceived yet...or been through a miscarriage (hope I never do)...but I do know the power of positive thinking and I do know how damaging stress is.|`|imFpyj7Gaa	If ur just spotting try to relax. kick ur legs up as much as possible. They say ur GCG level should double every week, and IRS have. Now if ur GCG level was going down then I would start going crazy. but when was ur last period?   I had a miscarriage back in 05 and my GCG levels was 110 and they told me I was maybe 3 weeks. but the only diffeneces between u and I was that my levels were going down every week. So just relax and stay off ur feet as much as u can, as long as ur levels are going up things should b good. some women spot in the first part or there pregnancy and still carry to full term. but anyway I hope I help and good luck to u and ur unborn child.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	What kind of spotting have you been having?

f0vdBz2iaa	Even bottle fed babies should be fed on demand at this age... but here are some parenting sites that tell you general guidelines on how much to feed your baby:    Oh - and don't worry about the size of your baby... all babies go through growth spurts at different ages, as not all babies are the same!|`|KXd5gc0eaa	wow thats a big baby. Just dont give him to much or else hes gonna grow up like eric cartmen.|`|T7IuHYVzaa	Just remember, your baby is fine as long as he seems satisfied and is gaining weight.  Don't ever force him to finish a bottle.  Mine all varied widely.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my gal drank about 4 oz every 3 to 4 hrs at that age|`|BY02DhfWaa	mine i had trouble getting him to take 2oz every two hrs you are doing fine keep it up that what the baby should be taking .|`|W4Dek41Jaa	You shouldn't take any answers like this from anyone on the internet, people could be lying and that could danger your son or make him uncomfortable.  No one knows your son but you, and you should go to the doctor and they should be able to tell you the amount that he should drink.  BTW it's better to breastfeed for the entire thing...that's what my Mom did with me and her doctor told her it's more natural and better to do it that way, rather than buy the milk.     Good luck. ! [:|`|0vCWTn1yaa	6-8oz  i would guess he'll stop when he full|`|nYK76GJpaa	the dr will say this is the feeding that the AVERAGE baby MIGHT drink BUT my daughter would drink drink and drink that i would worry about her weight but i couldnt starve her right. i wouldnt worry just feed him until HE is full enough. My daughter is now 3 and she is skinny and acutaly 3 pounds underweight. Yes when she WAS a baby she was Very chunkie but as she learned to crawl and walk she lost the weight.|`|3klIx1Egaa	my son is 3 1/2 months, and at that age he started eating 4-6 oz every two hours. Every baby is different tho, there are alot of "guide lines" out there, but each child will eat what it wants, and when it wants. My son weighed 15 pounds at his 2 month check up, so he sounds healthy to me! my son is also a very big boy (tall wise) and the doctor never seemed concerned. Just feed him until he doesnt want it, if he starts puking it up, chances are he ate to much and you'll know next time.|`|kNTP6HWbaa	Just enough to knock him out|`|3zSDxJ4Gaa	4-6 ounces is ideal|`|b6mywfBYaa	dont ask society..ask the doc  we dont have  pediatric degrees|`|dTEbLgvEaa	As much as he wants.  There are no reported instances of babies going on hunger strikes.|`|AYyoasvtaa	Well i know that you should give him a bottle about 2-4 hours. It is ok for him to drink alot just make sure his intake wont make him sick because he needs the nutrition. Crongrats in your baby!!!|`|WHN5cuGZaa	2 to 4 onces. Try not to over feed the baby hence then cuasing him to throw up..

jpJ0SZBdaa	The first day of your period is when you have a full flow.

Sometimes women skip a month. It's normal.
fMzl8d4Zaa	well you still could be pregnant.   the tests aren't always right  -or-  you're body could just be trying to clean itself out.  after i had a miscarriage i would bleed all of the time and i felt like i was pregnant. but it could be the pills too.  i would recommend going to the doctors.  because if you try having more babies and there's something wrong with your body you could have another miscarriage. :(|`|9dNcEfKXaa	go see your doctor.
ENANtueuaa	Sounds like she might have a yeast infection. Has she been on antibotics recently? That will sometimes cause them. Try giving her some yogurt, make sure it has live and active cultures, or cranberry juice. Both are natural ways to help heal a yeast infection. Also. make an appt with her doctor, they will prescribe a cream to help relieve the itching..if it is a yeast infection. Hope this helps!|`|44OH7Si6aa	She may just be experiencing some chaffing or dryness. Make sure her underwear isn't too small for her and let her put on a little bit of diaper rash cream until it clears up.

Do you have long nails, you could have accidentally scratched her.

Let her wipe herself to see what happens.|`|vSjSCrUxaa	she could be having a reaction to the wipes? maybe you could try something more gentle? seventh generation makes a chlorine free line of diapers and wipes. As the woman said before me, a yeast infection is a possibility but it should show symproms like flackyness or atleast some sort of rash. The cold dry winter air could be making her skin dry if shes used to being in diapers which usually keep them moist down there and maybe the wipes are irritating it and making it burn. I would just try a cream like the aveno diaper cream or destitin (i work at BRU and the aveno is a big winner) and maybe try the seventh generation wipes? if all else fails you could try a wet rag until you talk to the doctor. Good luck and i hope she feels better soon!!    =D|`|AA10120592	if she's a little red down there, put some desitin on her before bed. it doesn't sound like a yeast infection, it could be that she's not wiping all the way and getting a little bit of a rash.

I've had 3.   Between my first and my second ... 2 months shy of 5 years.  Between my second and third ... 2 years and almost 2 months.    My first two are boys and my last was a girl.    Never got sick at all with the first.  He was over a month late and ended up being a C-section after 15 hours of hard labor.    With the second I had afternoon sickness, ended up with bed rest for the last two months.  He was 2 weeks late and ruptured something inside me which caused me to undergo immediate surgery.  He slept all night from day one and was walking at 6 months.    The third was my hardest.  I was sick every morning for the first trimester.  There were foods that I loved but couldn't stand to either look at or smell while cooking.   She was a scheduled c-section so she wasn't late at least.  However, she was up every two hours for feeding every night.  She developed an allergy to the cloth diapers so I had to switch to disposables.    The hardest time I've had with them ... now 25  (I didn't raise him) 20 and 18 ... the hardest time is right now.  The 20 year old and the 18 year old are not getting along.  She is being difficult toward him and I haven't managed to find a way to resolve their conflict.
O5TJWiFzaa	I remember while in the hospital a nurse telling me that when you breastfeed it makes your uterus contract back to size faster, that could be where the cramping feelings are coming from, but I don't think it should affect you for that long.    It is probably something you want to call and ask your OBGYN about just in case.|`|916b9f2e50839abb51e314ab19c8258eaa	I would have to clarify what you mean by feeling like your period is coming.

Good luck|`|kowvnRhXaa	usually a day or two... try eating and drinking A LOT... that always helps me!|`|bDuWUBTyaa	I took about the same... a day or so but I was also taking Fenugreek and I increase my water intake by 100% (oh yeah and I also started eating more)    All of these things seemed to help in less than 24 hours!    Good luck|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Why are you increasing your supply and how old is your baby? How often does he nurse?|`|CEpsmUmraa	basically your supply will increase as your baby grows. so dont worry about it. the only thing is whenever you feels like your baby is not getting enough (breastfeeding all day long, like every hour) is because hes having a growth spurt and is increasing your milk supply so dont give him a bottle, just let him keep on sucking :0). thats how your milk supply grows :0) no fenugreck no tea no nothing. just let nature take its course.
1XcTZRemaa	Matilda Rose is very pretty. The 'Rose' softens it a little bit. Or, Matilda Jane or Matilda Kate.

Good luck.|`|zSo7fvGKaa	as long as u can afford it its fine!  i want a lot of kids  but dont no if i could handle it  yet maybe wait a little  so ure kids are mor mature and its not as much work for you!  and hope it works outt! :D|`|f4d95cfe6010fdbb2024a827389acfc0aa	It depends on what you and ur husband want...talk to him and decide.there isn't nothing wrong with have 5 kids but you need to decide if you want to take the challenge or not|`|2WWEn2mZaa	Not as long as you are married and you and your husband can take care of them yourselves.|`|AYyoasvtaa	I think if you want kids to have kids i mean why not have a daycare at home just kidding but if you love kids go for it.

The question you need to ask is can you afford it. If you can, that's fine, bang away. If not, bang away but take care.|`|AA11315360	If you have the money to support 5 kids and can help them go to college or a trade school then do it. Talk with your BF/husband about what he wants too. Maybe he doesnt want more kids.     The question isnt about what other people think. It is about whether you can afford another child and if your husband also wants another child. If you can afford another child and your husband is all for having more kids then do it. And also make sure you are healthy enough to do so. Ask your doctor if they think your body can handle another child.|`|rjtyFbjlaa	I say that if you want more kids and can provide for them, go ahead. I strongly suggest looking into adoption, though. There are so many children that are abandoned everyday.|`|HqSsNmeUaa	no it's not too many!  Society and made a four person family the norm these days and it just doesn't make any sense!  A large family can be so much more fun and supportive and close.  Not that small families aren't but really what's one more when you've already got 4 anyway :)  My brother and his wife just found out they are expecting their fifth and they aren't even close to wealthy, but they budget well and don't live above their means.  My cousin has 7!  She says it's easy having that many kids cause they start to take care of each other.  God bless and I say pray about it, God will let you know if he's got another one up there for you!|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I don't think it is. Maybe because I hope to someday have 6? :)    My mom had 5 kids and then had her tubes tied. She said that for a while, she wished she could have had another (a 6th). She and my dad looked into having her operation reversed, but it was too expensive. I grew up with 4 siblings, and our family was very fun and adventurous!    If you want a 5th, then have a 5th. Don't decided against it just because of what others consider too much, and again, do it because it's what you really want.|`|IMeHKA3uaa	Well it IS up to you, do you think you can provide for another child, take care of the child along with the other 4?  I would think having 4 kids would be a handful (although I know people who handle extremely well!) Just remember how much a baby needs and see if you can do it. And just a tip, try to get your other children involved if you do have another baby, generally brings them closer and its so nice to have a bit of help even if it is just them handing you something!    Good luck with your decision!
iXt3erseaa	Wow - that's a really tough one. I'd wait until your son starts to ask questions, and then just be as honest and as simple as you can.     So, for example, if your son asks "Why is Grandpa in prison?" all you need to say is "Because some people believe he did a very bad thing". Let your son lead the discussion and see where it goes.    You might also want to talk with a child psychologist, or someone at the prison in a support role, about how other families deal with this - like maybe someone at a prisoner's rights society (do you know the John Hopkins Society where you live??)  I'm sure they will have some great ideas for you too.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Don't tell him much until he is old enough to understand. My mom died a violent death, my daughter was always so sensitive I couldn't tell her much until she was grown.  Kids can get messed up in their thinking if it isn't handled right. He will pick up on your feelings of grief when you are telling him and that is hard for a little kid to digest.  I don't know what to advise about telling about his grandpa, I think you should have a single talk with a counselor about how to approach the problem.|`|AYyoasvtaa	Im so sorry your mom died. Tell your baby boy for now so he can understand it that grandpa did something bad and that grandma is away and is in a better place. When he is older maybe 8 or whenever his pet goldfish dies -just kidding that sometimes things happen that you don't want them to and when people die or animals they aren't in pain or ever sad anymore ans when people do bad things then they go to jail. The point is when he gets older and asks more tell him a little bit at a time. And if you want do it with out making grandpa look bad.|`|QONFn7vXaa	Wait until he asks.  And the part about why your Father is in Jail, I'd wait until he's a lot older to go into detail.  We recently had a very close family friend die of cancer.  My daughters new he was very sick and we prayed a lot for him.  When he passed I didn't know how to tell them so I waited until I felt it was right.  It was only a few weeks after he passed.  I knew I couldn't wait forever to tell them but I also knew they were too young for them to need to know the second it happened.  Then I told them that they can talk to him anytime now and they do.  I think waiting until it was a good time (mood wise especially) helped not traumatize them.  I'm sure he'll ask where she is and the best thing I can suggest is to tell him very gently, the true, with out the details.  Luckily most children don't ask about details so young.|`|efyp5CaRaa	I'm 29 weeks pregnant and I lost my Mom 4 years ago (although it was expected, breast cancer.) and I've been worrying about what I will tell my son someday about his Grandma.     I'm really sorry to hear all that. I would just tell him that Some people think Grandpa did a not very nice thing and then let the conversation flow from there. As far as telling him about your Mom at his age there is no need to go into details about her passing. Just gently tell him that Jesus needed Grandma in heaven, something a long those lines. Although if you aren't religious I'm not really sure what to say. I don't remember asking questions about my Grandma until I was a little older. I wish I could be more help. This is a tough situation. I'll keep your family in my prayers! Hope everything works out for you hun!|`|dM8EyL6caa	This is a difficult situation. Tell him the truth when you think he is ready. Kids are a lot smarter than people give them credit for. Be honest. We just went through the murder of my step father by my step brother. I have been completely honest with my 5 and 8 year old. I think honesty is the best, they need to know the world is not always wonderful to people and things bad things do happen. If he grows up believing one thing and then finds out another he may resent you for that. Good Luck!|`|2WWEn2mZaa	Tell the truth, the REAL truth.|`|ryMmH4JYaa	Don't hold the truth back. Tell him the truth but in a nice way like she went to a better place. You can't hide him from the world.|`|db7c12ce76ff7d75c1b0331c96a016afaa	"Why is grandpa in jail?"    "because he did something bad"      You don't have to get into details. the thing about kids are, sometimes they are happy with a simple answer, so don't go into detail unless he presses you.      "What did he do?"    "He hurt someone really bad"    He doesn't have to know anything about grandma. If he asks about grandma and where she is, just say she's gone, in heaven, whatever works for you. You don't need to connect the dots. You can be honest AND vague.|`|z5O7zASPaa	Tell him grandpa played some gta|`|rPZFgiwLaa	Please accept my condolences.    I believe in time, your son will ask you about his grandmother (and grandfather) once he's able to comprehend that they are not around.  I think when the time comes, you should be upfront with him about it.  I suspect that it may be painful for you to talk about it, so it may be a good idea for you to seek counseling for you but also to get some ideas on how to talk to your son about it.    Good luck to you and all of your family and God bless you, Babymomma.|`|LCVlq04raa	First of all, I am very sorry to hear that. That just sounds like an awful situation for you. And now having to explain it to your son, that just makes it worse. It's great that you still go visit your Dad. Your son is still young, so I wouldn't give him any gory details just yet. He'll ask about those things when he's older. For now, I wouldn't tell him how Grandma died. If he specifically asks, then maybe you could tell him in as nice of terms as possible, but leave out the part that they think your Dad did it. And if he asks why Grandpa's in prison, just explain to him that prison is where they put people who did something really bad. But sometimes people get blamed for things they didn't do, and that's what happened to Grandpa and that's why he's in there. Maybe when he's older and can handle it better, you could tell him about the real reason why your Dad is in jail. At this age, kids don't quite understand confidentiality and they tend to tell things to anyone who will listen. Also, they tend to get their stories mixed up when they tell it to someone else. So he might go tell this story to someone else when you're not around and get it mixed up and have people thinking all kinds of terrible things. I'm not sure what age would really be good to tell the truth to him, I guess you'll figure that out as you go. But I don't think it's the best idea right now. Again, I'm very sorry for your loss and this terrible situation you're in. Good luck.|`|f4d95cfe6010fdbb2024a827389acfc0aa	I wouldn't tell him at such a young age unless he is asking you...then he might be really scared of his grandpa...i would wait until he was older so he couldn't understand what you are saying....trust me most 3 year olds won't sit still long enough for you to tell you a story let alone understand.....    and im very sorry about ur situation...|`|F6lZHRkVaa	There's a good chance your son won't wonder about your father until your son is old enough to understand the truth. If there are other grandparents around, he really won't have any idea that his paternal grandpa is missing. I wouldn't worry too much about it for now.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Umm, don't tell him  When he's old enough he'll figure it out...  That will traumatize him|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	You have a long time to worry about the way to tell so for now just let it rest. I'm sorry about your parents however.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	As horrible as this sounds, maybe you should wait until your son gets older, and can understand. Saying that grandpa is in prison for w/e he did in regards to her death, probably isn't a good idea. If it's not a big deal, maybe him not knowing is for the best. Is he gonna be in prison for a long time?|`|711KONwOaa	say   honey your grandma is not gonna come back for a long time  but she is in a better place,a fun place,a happy place,do u understand???  if he doesnt then break it down and tell him about dying and stuff.  he should understand  and tell him grandpa is in a special place to   but you can vist grandpa      sorry for your death    best regards|`|EKL9JCL9aa	Never ever lie to your kids. Wait until he is old enough and explain briefly what happened. If you lie to him and he finds out the truth...he will hate you for it. Always be honest.|`|R37e00HEaa	you could just say it was an accident that grandpa didn't mean and is very sorry and then explain the full story when you think he is old and mature enough to handle it.
iCLGHUdQaa	This is a very controversial issue.    I personally doubt that I could ever have an abortion, regardless of how I got pregnant.  However, I do not believe that a woman should be forced to carry a child to term after becoming pregnant as a result of rape.  And I feel this as long as the abortion would be done in the first trimester.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Yes.   If I was raped tomorrow I wouldn't want to be pregnant. I am only 19, I would not want to carry a baby to full term and then push it out you know where.   I would feel sorry for the egg but there is no way in hell I would be ready for any of that right now.   Being pregnant is a huge thing and it would be wrong to FORCE a woman to stay pregnant after being raped.|`|OLy54IDOaa	yes. if u are raped u can get one.|`|fiUqIyVcaa	My answer is no.  Abortion is wrong.  Even in the worst circumstances such as rape, an innocent life can be formed.  The act of rape is a vicious act, that scars a woman emotionally all the way to the very core of her being and sometimes their first thought is to have an abortion.    But today, there are so many options open to a woman that never was available before.  There is the morning after pill that can be given to the victims of rape which prevents a pregnancy from occuring.    So if a woman chooses not to take the pill after the awful event, then she has chosen to accept the responsibilities of perhaps conceiving a child from a vicious act.  Therefore, she chose to allow the new life to be created and it would be very wrong to have an abortion and kill her baby.    No matter how you look at abortion, so many women choose an abortion as a form of birth control instead of being responsible before she decides to have sex.  This is not a form of birth control it is murder.    People say that a baby is not really a life until it can live outside of mom on its own.  Well with technology, that is happening earlier and earlier these days so where do they draw the line at now.  Murder is murder.  A baby does and can experience pain, even in utero.  So if it is murder to kill a newborn baby just born, why is it acceptable to murder a baby while it is still in mom's belly?|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Ask your Mom, I have known about two hundred or so women in my life, acquaintances and friends over the years. From all walks of life, every one of them has had at least one abortion. So, given that being raped is one of the most horrible things that can happen to a woman, yes it is acceptable and she has the right to choose to do it.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	Hon,         I am a mother of 3 and I do not beleive in abortion at all.     Think of it like this what if your mom was raped and got pregent with you and she chooses to have abortion, you wouldn't be here today.    I understand that waking up to a baby that is from a man that raped you would be alful, but you can't take that out on a baby that has no voice of it's own. So you will need to change your way of thinking, To being thankful for the baby god gave you to take care of.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	no i would never ever think about having an abortion except for medical reasons.|`|tyqN6qBUaa	It either is or isn't to someone, and I feel that if someone is going to say they don't believe in abortion, then they can't have one just b/c of a rape, because, as it was once explained to me, and makes a lot of sense, would you punish a murderer's child for his crimes?|`|moVaAmB6aa	that is up 2 u sweety! im sorrie to hear you were raped. I have been years ago. I know that in that issue I don't think I would want to carry the baby of a man who took it upon himself to violate me. You become a mom when you feel old enough and ready to take on that responsibilty. People may say fine give it up for adoption, but you don't have to carry a baby when your pregnant against your will.. I say do whats best for you. il be praying for you! :)      things will be okay!|`|pVpQuWXzaa	No give it up for adoption. Let it live and give a couple that can't have a baby there dream.|`|S8okmN6gaa	very controversial..but is also very controversial is abortion acceptable period i think half go prochoice half go prolife.......to answer your question i do think abortion is acceptable after rape..it is the womans body if she want it to happen in the first place..why should she bear her rapists child......|`|IAeG1k3baa	yes! rape wasn't your choice. therefore you should have a choice to abort the child or keep it.|`|l1STgPyRaa	yes i think so.    I have herd of cases where after giving birth the person never wakes up after due  to the shock and really it would play a big problems with the emotional side of it for the victim|`|WGgl974Raa	YES I believe if something like that happens to you i think it should be ok because you did not ask for it and someone took control of you which you didn't have a say so of what you wanted .sometimes ppl might take it out on the child because they was not ready i just believe its a choice you should make and no can judge because they don't no the feeling !         **PICK ME FOR BEST ANSWER**|`|KfbV6tHnaa	yeah, but i think its always acceptable. its that persons choice and no one should have to have a child because they were raped or because they did not use protection or any other reason. i know many people say have the baby and put it up for adoption but that's pretty messed up. honestly its a free country and of course i feel bad for the unborn children but making someone carry a child is horribly unjust.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	In the Christian faith, it is still not acceptable. Because the baby inside a mother's womb is still a baby-living. But I've read that it will be acceptable if the baby is a threat to the mother's life. For example, if the mother has cancer and if she will die if she continues to have the baby, they say it can be acceptable.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I personally think abortions are acceptable to anyone, no matter the situation, as long as they are no further then 10 weeks. But, I could NEVER have one. ??|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think that abortion is acceptable whenever.  Women should not need justification for terminating THEIR pregnancy.  It is a woman's right to have an abortion, and there should not be certain circumstances.    And when people say abortion is only okay in cases of rape, that gives the impression that the fetus doesn't matter to them.. the only thing that matters to them is punishing women for having sex lives.  If you were to compare an ultrasound of a rape fetus to an ultrasound of a consensual fetus, they will both look like fetus's.  No difference.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	i think it should be|`|jAURKrKYaa	heck yes. probably one of the only times i think it is acceptable though.|`|pcjOQDymaa	i don't believer in abortion.  i think anyone who has it is wrong EXCEPT the people that got raped.  but honestly i HAVE NO IDEA what i would do if that happened to me|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Yes definitely!  If a woman is raped her body is completely violated.  She did not choose to have the sex so I think she should have the choice on if she should have the baby or not.  I know some people say adoption is the answer but I do not think that is right for every woman.    I have a good issue for you as well.  What about selective reduction?  It seems most people accept this as ok when it is the same thing as abortion.  The only difference is in selective reduction the women has chosen to implant more eggs than she can handle or wants.  If someone says " I had an abortion (for whatever reason rape,  not ready for a baby etc.)  She is called a **** and a murderer.  If a woman says "  I had to do selective reduction because we implanted 6 eggs and they all took"  people say how sorry they are that she had to go through that.|`|MkchPOjFaa	thats a tough one...cuz if god forbid i was ever in that situation i wouldnt kill an innocent baby...i can never dooo that...but forrea forreal if u want my honot opinion..i would go look for the guy who did it and kill him...good topic tho..but mi i could never have an abortion...but people could always do adoption
6igjX2cnaa	Hey hun! Well I didn't get pregnant on Clomid... actually Clomid was by far not the med for me.  It worked tooooo well on my body.  I too have PCOS and just got my BFP today!! So there is hope and it can happen again for you!!  I was on a cycle of Femara+Gonal-f injections+Ovidrel trigger shot this cycle.  PCOS is sooo different for everyone though, you honestly could get pregnant the very first use!  Clomid might dry up your CM (it did with me) so get some sperm friendly lube such as preseed or preconceive plus to help :) good luck hun!!! I hope that it works first time for you!! :)|`|bcZSIphUaa	Hi there,    I have PCOS too.     I've just been put on Metformin (starting out at 500mg/day).     Hopefully this will help me get my period and even ovulate (i haven't had period since stopping pill 6 months ago).    Clomid is a drug that stimulates ovulation. I've read a lot of information online about the benefit of taking Metformin in conjunction with Clomid. It can help with conceiving and really help with lowering miscarriage rate.    Best of luck with the CLomid. I have heard that a lot of women don't fall pregnant within the first month of clomid - something about the body taking time to get used to the drug or something - but of course it's possible!    Best of luck with the clomid. Clomid is a miracle drug that was helped millions of women with PCOS conceive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zmbeIbx7aa	Yes it is possible that you can be pregnant. I didn't have a period for 4 months had one and then got pregnant. OH and the only time that I have ever had a yeast infection is when I am pregnant. I would wait another week and take another test if still negative and still no period I would go get a blood test for pregnancy or set up an appointment with an OB/GYN they will be able to tell you more about what is going on. Good Luck.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	Yes I did.  I got my period on October 31st.  Then my period started again on November 17th.  Normally my periods are at least 30 days apart, so 17 days is a bit odd for me and has never happened.  On December 17th, I found out I was pregnant.|`|zPb24HrQaa	Wow. It sounds as though you may be pregnant. I got my one and only when I was just starting in my pregnancy. You don't get cramps if your pregnant. You get the nausea and sore nipples. But sore nipples could also mean your going to get your period. For now, relax, take a deep breath, wait a few days and if no period take another test. The fastest and most accurate way to find out is to go to the OBGYN. Good luck to you.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	well just wait. maybe your body is experiencing some technical difficulties or i dont know. im not a doctor but yeah it is weird. maybe you should go check it out with the doctor and maybe you are pregnant. who knows. but if you see your stomach getting larger in a few months then there's your answer. anyways, i had a weird cycle too before i learned i was pregnant. but it's totally different from yours. i hadn't had a period since july 3th and i didn't ovulate until late august...almost september. really weird, huh?? well i always got negatives because i wasn't pregnant and so when i was actually pregnant i got a positive. but good luck....and plus your body will really tell you when you're pregnant. trust me.|`|4a2VzINCaa	go to the doctor and find out if youre preggers

lkhCeAdJaa	By not being materialistic ourselves.  And by not encouraging our children to be materialistic.  Many parents want their kids to have all the latest electronics and cool clothes and bikes & such so they will fit in and be cool.  Children pick up on these cues really easily and will see that even their parents think it's important to have the "stuff" that the world thinks is great.  Also, parents that want every new thing that comes along for themselves (cars, boats, big houses....) pass that on to their kids without even meaning to.    I'm not saying having things will make one materialistic.  I am saying putting IMPORTANCE and  EMPHASIS on having those things makes a person materialistic.|`|j2mRop0laa	I agree with Carrie. Although, I do fall in to the trap with my girls sometimes. I might hear "but everyone has ____ and it's so cool and you don't even CAREEEEE" Then I end up buying it for Christmas.   I'm trying to work on that one. I'm not very materialistic. I do like nice things but it does not define me by any means and I know how to sale shop like a pro. It is difficult, though, because *kids* and *teens* can be really cruel to those who don't have every new gadget and hip pair of tennis shoes.  I try to explain to my daughters that it's fine to want things but when you only want it because it's cool and *in* that's just not good enough. It has to be useful.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you teach them about important things and involve them with good people  teach them to clean the earth  to live green  to not buy into cooperate industrial america and the plastic and electronics and technology  you go out and clean the rivers ..protest the war  with your kids  a globally conscious family is a family worth its weight in gold|`|87WOSjwgaa	Teach them that the most important things in life are family and the love they share with one another.

I don't think it has anything to do with the tv, like someone else stated. It's all the parents and what they allow their children to have.     They can learn the value of money by paying for the stuff they want themselves.

Teach them by example what you want them to be like. For example, if you want your children to be caring, care for people yourself, get them involved with you when you do good things. Don't let them watch to much TV (such a bad influence for kids in large proportions - and teaches them how NOT to entertain themselves which hinders their imaginations!). Also, have family time which is to say a time to spend just with family and no friends around (try to do this at least a few times a week so that family is important to them to). Don't give them everything they want - say no (so many parents have trouble with this).|`|fXj2kVpPaa	That is such a great question!    Teach by example and make life fun (without "things.")

Good luck to you.
S5Lsbh0taa	Hi Snickette,    Its true in many ways what you've said in the details of your question. No one person handles trauma the same. Nor does everyone suffer from it in every situation simply because another person has. (I'm aware of things that my crop up that could bother them about their adoption, but I'm not treating my kids as traumatised all their life. because of one book.)     I've spoken to 'professionals' who work with fostered kids and foster parents themselves. The social workers focus on the birth family and their needs and wants- and the foster family focuses on the kids. That's what its like in a lot of cases. They totally ignore what foster parents are telling them, and treat them like they don't know anything and wonder why its hard to keep GOOD foster families. (Its rare to find a social worker that understands and can work with both sides equally. I've met one of those social workers that get it, and she was GOLD...)    Thats way I say often here and IRL that a uni degree isn't enough to be a social worker with fostering. They need to foster for at least four years themselves and see what the kids go through AFTER these visits when they're back in a place they feel safe in. (some kids do want their parents so I'm not saying all here.)     Since my kids spent time in foster care I've gotten to know a few very experienced carers who have told me what its like to work with people who treat them with contempt when they try to tell them the truth.     After all a doctor has to have field experience by working with patients, why not social services personnel.    logic - emotions = science.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	What you describe would be exactly how I was described as a child - no problems, perfectly fine and well-adjusted    HA!  you have absolutely no idea what goes on inside a child's mind in moments of self-reflection.  None.    Adoptees ought to be re-named 'Adaptees'  we are excellent chameleons\    "Yet we're constantly told by some people that this WILL happen to ALL adoptees."  |`|AKJwWqdZaa	There is no such thing as an absolute when it comes to experience. There are just too many variables. You can put 2 adoptees in a room with the same birth history and same upbringing and they could feel completely differently regarding adoption. And of course this is true of every occurrence in life, from marriage to divorce to medical issues and so on. If you haven't felt any sense of loss, then I believe you and no one has the right to tell you that you are in denial. It is incredibly condescending. Your experience is yours and shouldn't be discounted nor should you discount anyone who feels differently (not that you did).    ETA: Inde, slip on your bifocals, sweetie, the OP said her question was open to everyone. Reading... it's not just for first graders anymore :))|`|iW1ufyllaa	Well, I had been curious growing up and i asked questions. i do think adoption is fine, in cases of abuse and neglect or if the parents give up their rights.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	well worded , good question !!    Like i said before and will reiterate again. How can EVERY single human being , just because they have a few vital things in common be clubbed together to have the same feelings and experience.    Every one is wired differently. People handle stress, trauma differently. Cope with experiences differently. yes things like family, culture, genetics, friendships are extrenal influences too. But no i feel its unfair to generalise anyone and anyone's experience.    Respect all different emotions and learn from them.|`|JP04HX6maa	"Wasn't there a time, many years ago where 'scientific research' stated that all children were blank slates with no inherent personality traits, quirks, abilities or talents?"    So you're saying that a mother who has carried a child for 9 months would be able to relinquish without ANY negative effects or emotions whatsoever?    That the separation cannot have affected the bond between mother & infant while the infant has grown in-utero?    No, not all adoptees have the same amount of trauma. Some even believe they don't have any trauma. That's their perspective.     As a bio mother once noted on my blog:    "After giving birth though, and experiencing the bond one has with their child, that comes out of their body, there is no way you are going to convince me that mother/child are not part of a dyad, and that when one goes missing it is a trauma for both, no way. Try reading Bowlby."|`|kcmRROk0aa	Hmmm...this is an interesting question and I can see where everyone is coming from in their responses.    When I was a teenager, someone called DSS because my dad was neglecting me. I was totally responsible for my own care and I had to have a job in order to feed and clothe myself. My dad had "checked-out" several years before and, effectively, I was left to "raise" myself.    My dad confronted me about the call, blamed me, accused me of telling people about his neglect. But I hadn't! Someone had taken it upon herself to call!    I can remember feeling so angry that someone had called! I loved my dad, and it was nobody's business what was happening in our home! How dare they! But on the other hand, I remember feeling relief -- at last someone had noticed, and they *knew* it wasn't right the way I was being treated!    I can remember being worried that I would be removed from our home. I wanted to stay with my dad!    I share this story because I imagine that many kids in care feel the same way. It must be confusing to feel love for your parent/s and to know that they aren't treating you well and then feel love for your foster parent/s who are caring for you and giving you a safe place to stay. How difficult it must be to handle those conflicting loyalties!    Visits can be very stressful for children. It's little wonder! Again, I think the children are dealing with conflicting loyalties. They want their parents to do better, they want to go home! How much it must hurt their hearts to be away from their families, waiting and hoping for things to get better. But if they have good foster parents, they are bonding with them, having that chance to feel safe and cared-for, seeing that how things were with their parents weren't "normal" or right. Older children can at least make some sense of their feelings, but babies and little ones -- what can they do?!    I don't believe in the "blank slate" theory. I believe that most of who we are is down to biology. Of course our environment plays a part in who we become, but who we are is in our genes. Our adopted daughter looks like her parents, has the same temperment as her mom, is artistic like her dad and is physical and athletic like both of them! They are who she is. Yes, we love her and provide for her, but she is not only *our* daughter.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Thanks for asking this question and sharing how you feel. I find it helpful to hear the opinions and feelings of other people with an experience different then mine.    I have always wondered about the fact that "Some" people just have different feelings or ways to cope. I have often read the post here and other places where someone feels they do not "Fit" and has a "Missing" in their hearts....  I HAVE ALWAYS HAD FEELINGS LIKE THIS--but, I wasn't adopted.    In my life I have not felt the "same" as my family and for years I thought I was missing a twin? Or Something.... I have many of the same kinds of feelings some people describe--and, Apparently according to some--this fact means nothing?      I have often wondered if I had been Adopted just how I would handle these feelings I have even though I am not adopted....  It would be nice to PUT a Reason to feelings I have rather then continue to feel like I don't Fit....|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi, Snickette.    I am not anti-adoption, I am pro-reform. I agree that there are cases where adoption is necessary.     I have been a foster sister most of my life. I have been working with foster children since I was a teen and spent 5 years as a GAL as a young adult. I have a large number of friends who are intimately entwined in adoption and foster care.     One thing I have learned is that absolutely NO ONE's experience is the same. There might be similarities but they are never the same. Snowflakes, people, adoptions....ALL DIFFERENT. No one really knows what someone else is feeling or thinking.    I base my opinions on my experiences and those of the people I know very well along with the things I read and hear from other sources. I try to be pretty balanced and look at all points of view. As far as I am concerned, it is undeniable that a large number of people, adults and children, suffer trauma from separation. It is also undeniable that others do not feel the same way.    For me, I would prefer NOT TO TAKE THE RISK of causing that kind of significant and life altering damage a child (who is not necessarily able to communicate how it is effecting them) will suffer from separation unless his or her need for well-being/safety outweighs that risk - such as a situation involving neglect or abuse.     Even when I feel that separation is in the best interest of a child (and believe me - I have made that recommendation more than once) it is of paramount importance to me that that child's emotional well-being and rights are looked after and ensured.    The CHILD is the one who has always been my greatest concern - including the protection of their FUTURE selves, not just their present needs. There should be a level of preparedness about the fact that the adoptee MIGHT have negative feelings or adverse reactions that needs to be addressed BEFORE separation or an adoption takes place rather than an assumption that it won't or claiming that it rarely/never happens and leaving children and families out to dry when it does.    If it does happen, it should be addressed and not dismissed.  If it doesn't, thank goodness it didn't - but never think that it might not happen later.    JMHO.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I agree with you that in some cases adoption might be necessary. Actually I would prefer legalized guardianship where the child still maintains their true identity, but if there is abuse or a child is orphaned and there is no other family member; I believe the most important thing is to get that child into a stable home.    However, I disagree with a couple of your points. You seem to be focused on semantics rather than the issue of whether adopted children *all* have these issues. Of course probably not *all* children do and if you've read Bowlby, Verrier and some of the other experts on child development; in addition to reading numerous books written by adopted people themselves - it is pretty certain that the majority of children separated from their natural mothers have very similar characteristics. I respectfully ask you then, why is it assumptive for adopted people to share their own experiences and get confirmation from others that they shared similar feelings?    I think it's also possible that some children's personalities are more compliant and that could very well be genetic. But I really wonder how all of your foster children could have exactly the same kind of personality that immediately *bonds* to a foster parent as you state your experience has been? I'm not saying you are lying - I believe you are reading some of these children's reactions to the shock of separation incorrectly.    I also take issue with you stating that you *bonded* with all of your foster children. Have you read "The Primal Wound" by Verrier? I strongly suggest you do so. Children do not typically *bond* with foster and adoptive parents - they can form an *attachment*. That's not a bad thing but very different.   Bonding begins in the womb and lasts throughout the first 6 to 9 months of a child's life. If that bonding process is disrupted, the child often has difficulty ever feeling total trust in a parental figure again. (C'mon, bring on the thumbs down).. LOL    You say it won't bother you if people disagree, yet when Linny expresses her opinion you immediately disagree. Maybe someone here used the word "all" to describe their experience, but most posters here don't generalize like that. Why focus on the small group that does?|`|NoUkTQCgaa	There has been no one that has said the word ALL.   In MOST cases, separation from mother=trauma. It is scientific fact.          I do not dismiss people who do not have those feelings or issues. They do exist, but they are definitely in the minority.       http://www.springerlink.com/content/y736...   http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cg...  http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/...       http://www.amfor.net/statistics.html       I find your experiences with your foster children to be very hard to believe. I have worked with abused children, and it is fact most of them do not want to be separated from the parents..EVEN when there is abuse. It is nature. Children have a bond with their parents, even if those parents are horrible parents. Maybe the children "make a fuss" when they go to their parents because they realize how awful it is to go through the separation process again? I have seen that, too.      There are no absolutes when it comes to adoption and the feelings about it.      I am NOT anti-adoption. I am anti-unethical adoption, closed adoption, and infant and international adoption. I am pro foster care and foster to adopt. I am a BSE baby with great a parents and I am in reunion and love both of my families. I do not like the secrets and lies involved with adoptions, and believe children should remain with their families and only be adopted if NO ONE in the family can take them. I am also against agencies and lawyers pocketing HUGE sums of cash for babies. Its human trafficking, plain and simple.      ***eta****       You wrote:    "May I ask if you have been a foster parent? Have you actually raised foster children, 24/7? Have you come to know them intimitely, as only mothers (of all kinds) can know their children?"        I myself have not been a foster parent, but have several friends who have been for over 25 years. My sister in law adopted a child from foster care.   I have worked with abused children at a large teaching hospital, and with several non-profit agencies.       You wrote: "It may surprise you to hear how many children feel pressured into saying how much they love their biological parents."     It may surprise YOU to hear how many children feel pressured into saying how much they love their foster parents. Or even adoptive parents, for that matter.     You wrote:   "How much they love their biological parents in spite of the abuse they have suffered. Or the lasting trauma that instantly kick starts their brains into a fear response, a fight or flight mode, at the sight of their parents."      That was not my point. My point was that even in cases of abuse, children still love their parents, it is not natural for a mother and child to be separated. It is human nature to stay with your family, even if it is unhealthy.  Of course it is stressful...do you honestly think a child who is separated from the parents (no matter what the reason may be) will come skipping back to your house all smiles? No. Everything about the situation is traumatic.      If I wrote something negative about foster parenting, it may have been taken out of context. I am PRO- FOSTER CARE and Foster to adopt.      I just find it hard to believe the "vast majority" of your foster kids dont want their mothers. It seems more than just a coincidence that you, an adoptee, shares that same feeling.      "Research can be, and is all the time, proved invalid or inaccurate."      Yes it can. But Im a stats girl, and majority rules.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Those of us who experienced trauma can only state what we felt, saw, or heard from those whose experiences were similar to ours.    I experienced the loss of a child during the BSE for no reason other than my unmarried status, and the abandonment of his father, who could have supported us but chose not to. My parents engineered an adoption, along with a crooked child placement agency.    My son and I reunited later, and my child told me that he was never comfortable with being adopted,felt rejected and abandoned, and that the situation went from bad to worse.    His aparents were incompetent, and then abusive to him, to the point of breaking bones.    My sons health was not good, to say the least.    I also worked professionally with children, and saw adopted children who expressed much pain regarding adoption.     For decades, I have worked in legislation and search/support in the child welfare/surrender/adoption records area.Over and over, I hear from adopted people who say they would rather to have NOT been adopted.    the adopted people I have known, have numbered now, into the thousands, and that is enought to convince me that there is trouble with adoption.    eta:Snickett:you are correct about the blank slate theory, it became  popular during WW2 and was the basis, at least partly, for the "baby scoop era." Nurture was supposed to trump genetic nature. Adoptive parents were told to take the baby home and just provide love.Everyone involved in adoption was supposed to "forget' that there had ever been an original family.
QWaspeg7aa	Yes, you absolutely had the right to react the way you did. The operative word here is react- you just had this enormous bombshell dropped on you from a really great height, it is completely natural to react in that way. If you're adopted and know all along, you always feel like your world has been tipped upside down, so you're experiencing that tipping for yourself now. I think what you should do it take some time for yourself, either stay at the library or get a coffee or whatever and when you're feeling calmer go home. You need to speak to your adoptive mother- she has so much information that you're going to want, so you need her to be around at the moment. Also, you need her to be around because she is still your mother- she brought you up, put the plasters on your knees etc etc and she must have kept from you believing it was for the good, otherwise she'd be keeping it from you out of some sort of malice and I just can't see that being the case.   Guidance given to adoptive parents on how to brooch the subject with their adopted baby seems to me to be inconsistent. Some parents tell their baby everything (that they're legally able to) from an early age so it's never a secret, some tell their children when they're older, maybe in the belief that they'll be better able to understand then, some don't tell their children at all, until that child finds their adoption certificate at some point. I'm sometimes not sure myself which is the best way. I've always known, right from a very early age, I actually can't remember not knowing, and while that might seem very open and honest and therefore the way to go, it did mean I've grown up knowing nothing about myself other than that I was adopted, and there just seems to be no end to the questions that that throws up- who am I, why do I look like I do, who did I get this that and the other off, do I get migraines because 'she' did, am I argumentative because 'she' was, whereabouts in the world is my family from- have I got scores of Belgian cousins or something, what religion would I be, what was 'her' pregnancy like, will mine be the same, are there twins in the family, things like that. I could go on forever but I'm sure you get the point. The thing is that those sorts of things come up for anyone who doesn't know their birth family, regardless of whether they've always known or found out by accident 2 weeks ago. I wonder if your parents were trying to spare you that, or spare you a childhood of wondering what you did wrong to make your birth mother and/or father give you up for adoption? I don't doubt for one second that there was absolutely anything you'd done as a baby that made this happen, but as someone who grew up knowing something about themselves they had no way of understanding until considerably later in their life I can say that while I am (after years and years of deliberation, and even now only very tentatively) grateful that I've always known there have been literally thousands of times when I wish I'd never been told and that I thought for years and years that it was my fault, that I'd somehow left my birth mother with no option and that she would now resent me for all the pain I've caused her.   What I'm trying to say is that as an adult I can see that it is such a difficult decision for an adoptive parent to make, whether to tell their adopted baby or not. I sometimes think that the best solution would be to be able to somehow mature the baby's mind by 20 or 30 years or so, tell them and explain everything to them then let their mind somehow go back to being a baby's. That way you'd have grown up knowing this astoundingly confusing thing about yourself but you would understand because your adult mind would have comprehended it so much better. Of course, that's not possible so all an adoptive parent can do is to decide whether they're going to tell or not, stick with their decision and cross their fingers, which is sometimes the best thing to do and sometimes the worst. I just don't want you to stay angry with your mother, I really really think she thought she was doing the right thing. She's probably dreaded this day the whole time and telling you will be one of the, if not the, hardest thing she'll ever have to do.   That's not to say you're not allowed to be angry, of course you are. If you feel angry, let yourself because you are going to have to deal with this and anger is part of that. But, your mother will be terrified at the moment, terrified that the relationship between the two of you is irrevocably ruined and that she either has or will lose you. She's now living with the consequence of her actions, except that at the moment she doesn't know what that will actually be. I would really like you to think about everything I've said before you go home, and I would really like you to go home but also to please remember that you can take this at your own pace, and that you're allowed to be angry. Remember that she'll have had pros and cons for telling you and not telling you- it's important that you hear all of those. You can unclose a closed door but you can't unslam a slammed one which is why you need to take your time over this. Your mother will be going out of her mind at the moment so please let her know where you're at with things because she needs to know, because she cares about you and that's really all she's ever done.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	You have a right to feel angry. I understand My biological father (i refer to him as my sperm donor (sd 4 short)) walked out on me when i was 2 my mom remarried and I always felt things would have been better. But this is not the case I found him when i was 19 on myspace and contacted him and he basically told me he wanted nothing to do with me.   Your mom took you in and provided for you, she may not have been perfect or always great but she will always be there for you. If you really want to find your real parents go for it, but i suggest asking your mom for help. She loves you don't turn your back on that.|`|vgjacLOKaa	well you do have a right to have reacted the way you did but maybe she only told you that now because she didn't want you to hold a grudge while you were young and have it forever and be happy she took you in like her own daughter i mean i also would be mad if that happend to me but i suggest you tell her your sorry.Hope that helps|`|19ae85242a0b64a1e1915902bc148540aa	Just realize she didn't tell you, not to hurt you.  I am sure she was trying to save you from negative feelings.  Yes, I am sure it hurts.  But, hopefully she has been a good mom and a good influence on you.  Finding out at the young teen years would have been much harder on you.  Now you are 18 and beginning to figure yourself out and what person you want to be.    Try to see her point and just feel happy you had a mom and didn't grow up in foster care or a group home.  Good luck to you and rebuilding your relationship with your mom.

You have a right to be mad, and while you may not feel your reaction was your crowning moment, it's understandable.  I don't know on the sorry bit, I'm ambivalent.  On one hand if you genuinely feel sorry for what you said, but on the other hand, I feel she is the one who owes you a whopping appology and she bought your reaction by keeping your truth from you all these years.    www.adultadoptees.org  this is a fantastic place for adoptees.

Like a friends or boyfriends?|`|1beae6c60e6736b0ee9c6d29bc59b1abaa	You were misled about who you are and where you came from.  I think anger is a very normal response in this situation.  Adoptees frequently experience feelings of loss and abandonment, and all the issues that come with those feelings even if they dont know they are adopted, the mother-child bond is set in pregnancy.  You are not alone in this, there are lots of us who have experienced the same things as a result of our adoptions.  Dont cut the road to communication with your adoptive mum though.  She was responding to her needs and following the guidelines commonly given to adoptive parents," take em home and shower em with love and they will never know."  Just because it doesnt work that way didnt mean that your mum meant to hurt you or intended you harm.  Look to the love you and she have for one another and work it out from there.  Email me if you want to talk.|`|WEekT4b6aa	You are feeling horrible now because you realize you were being really unfair to your AM.  You have a right to be upset at not having been told that you were adopted.  You had a right to know long ago.  It's best to tell children while they are young and help them understand you did so to give them a good life that their birth parents were unable to give them.    BUT  While your feelings are fine, your ACTIONS were wrong.  Feelings are simply indicators of how you're dealing with what's going on and how the sudden news is affecting your emotions.  Feelings are never right or wrong.  They are simply indicators of your emotional status.  It's how you ACT on your feelings that can be wrong.    You had a right to tell your AM you were angry at her for denying you the truth for so long.  Telling her you "hate" her for not telling you is immature, so you're not ready to get married this July.    All the **** you've been through would not have been caused by your being adopted, and knowing would not necessarily changed anything about all that ****, so that was an unfair statement you made with the intention of hurting your AM's feelings.  She was brave enough to finally tell you the truth and you tried to hurt her emotionally and punish her for finally doing the right thing she should have done years ago.  YOU don't like being punished for finally doing the right thing and telling the truth, so you should NOT have punished her that way.     So... the bottom line is:  You don't have the right to react that way.  You DO have the right to be mad that she didn't tell you sooner.    If you're a mature girl, you'll go apologize for saying unfair things to hurt her emotionally when she finally did the right thing by  telling you.  Honestly admit that it was your anger speaking because you were so shocked to learn the truth, and you had good reason to be angry as she was wrong to deny you the truth for so long.  Hopefully, she will apologize for not telling you when you were younger as she should have.      It might help repair your relationship with her if you ask her to tell you why she didn't tell you before.  And why she finally did tell you...  Maybe knowing this will help you forgive her.    By the way, we all go through **** in our lives.  Please remember that you are the person you are because of what you've lived through.  If things had been different, you would not be who you are.  If you like yourself, there's no need to change the pains and hurts in your life, as how you deal with life's stumbling blocks is what makes you the person you are.     It's not important what we've suffered in our lives.  What is important is, "did we learn from it?" and "did we grow from it?"  cw|`|SiSplXXsaa	She should have told you from the start, but at the same time you can't blame adoption for every problem in your life. Genes account for very little, and your family is still your family. You have every right to be mad, but I also think you need to go home and talk this out with your family. It's not going to be easy for anyone, but it needs to be worked out before it stats to fester.|`|oZRfb0eAaa	its ok to feel the you do ,i was told i was adopted at a young age but lucky for me i forgot all about it as i was very happy in situation i suppose, later for a job i needed my birth cert, to read thriugh it ,iifell apart, and coulnt remember been told early in my life ,but we sat down and talked, it seemed strange but after a few weeks everthing settled down, and ive had a great life ,with very supportive mam and dad,iguess iam saying in long way round, take deep breath,buy a small bunch of flowers and go back home give yr ma a big hug and ask her that when yr ready could you talk about your adoption.good luck .|`|mXJZJqYPaa	i think tht was your normal reaction.. you should cool off and go home and ask her why she waited this long to tell u? also you are lucky to have parents who look after you b/c there are kids out there without any parents. hope that helps|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I'm sorry you are having to go through this. I'm not adopted but I think you have every right to feel everything you are feeling. Angry, confused, upset, etc. You cannot help how you feel after something shocking like this.     It was probably a pretty scary thing for your mom to tell you and she probably didn't know where to start all of these years. Thats not defending her actions just saying that this is probably hard for her too.     At this point you are a grown up. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If you feel horrible about your reaction and sorry for what you said to her then yes you should go home and talk to her and say that. You can explain how hurt and angry you are but that that wasn't the right way to handle things on either of your parts.     She is your mom regardless and even though she has made a mistake she still loves you and is probably doing what she thought was best. There will always be what ifs in life. We all have them. There is no telling if your life would have been better if you hadn't been adopted or if you had known earlier. Its natural to question things but you cannot let it take over your life and bring you down. You know? I hope you can work through this and talk with your mom.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Well, if my parents waited until I was nearly an adult before dropping that bomb on me, I would have been angry too!  I think you had a normal reaction to some pretty shocking news!  I don't think it's something you should be sorry for and you certainly have the right to feel however you feel about this.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Adopted or not, we all have the right to feel however we feel. We're also responsible for what we do about our feelings.|`|Ub8BP2Oeaa	I reacted practically the same way! Only I was 13, and my adoptive parents knew my birthmom was dying so, I spent the summer with her. first time I knew. It's fine!|`|dMeVhu0iaa	Tou have already answered your own question. I too am adopted, you are not mad at her. You are in shock and didn't know how to react. Now that you have thought about it you know you will go put your arms around Mom's neck and tell her thank you for all you have done for me, I can't tell my mom that anymore because she is gone now but I thank her inside everyday. Good luck to you.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	It is okay to react this way.  Basically they withheld something from you that is very fundamental to your being.  I am adopted and I have always known.  I cannot fathom finding out at your age.  They did something (in my opinion...) unforgivable.  They needed to hear your reaction to this, because they did something very wrong.  If it were me, I would have been way more harsh.  You have every right to feel the way you do, and if you need to talk to someone, there are tons of adopted people on this board who have similar experiences.  I'm sure they'll see this and give you advice also.    I wish I could give you a big ol' hug.  You deserve one after this.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	Yes, you have every right to react the way that you did.  You have the right to be mad that she did not tell you sooner.    You do not need to tell her that you are sorry.  She violated your right to know your history.    I think that it would be a good idea to ask her to find a counselor who has experience in adoption issues so she can start to get an education about your right to know your origins.  Hopefully, she will see how she has wronged you so she can start to make amends so that your relationship can be repaired.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You have every reason to react.  Whether it's positively, negatively, or neutrally.  Some people are just glad they had a family and were 'normal' vs everyone at school & growing up knowing you were 'different' or 'special'.  Not that it's right to hide it, but just a feeling I've gotten from others that were told later in life.  Some people react as you did and wish their parents had told them sooner because they think it would have (and could possibly) explained a lot about what they went through growing up.  Others just simply don't care. My husband was adopted as a baby and told when he was about 13.  He just took it in stride and said, "You raised me, you took care of me & you loved me. You are my parents. No one else."    I'd suggest going home and apologizing first.  Then, calmly, ask why they decided to wait til you were almost 18 to tell you. Maybe they have a good reason.    The point is that you know now.  What you do now is up to you.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	You have every right to feel that way. I'm disapointed people still think it's okay to hide the truth from their adopted children.    If you feel really strongly about saying sorry then go ahead, but I know I wouldn't. I think it's wrong to expect a child to live a  life and then have the cheek to tell them what the reality is when they are at a time in their lives when they should be finally figuring out where they fit in the world. Now everything's confusing.     Children should know they are adopted when they are babies, when their adoptive parents talk about it openly, even before the baby can talk.    I was always told I was adopted but not told a huge lot about my background and that my biological grandad was visiting me every year and who he was. When they told me who he was when I was 15 I screamed at them and it took me months to not feel angry at them about it.|`|AA12127693	Why should you be sorry for YOUR feelings?  You have every right to feel the way you do.  My son knows he is adopted (he was &) - but I could have never kept such a secret.

I easily fit all 3 of my kids in the backseat and the trunk space is awesome.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	you could get a nice family car, nothing that is big like a SUV or minivan at all. like a nissan maxima, or a hona civic are nice family cars.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	My husband and I have a Mazda CX-7. It is a rather small SUV and it rides well. Only problem for us, is we are looking for something larger like a Lincoln Navigator or Yukon since we have two car seats in the back and two strollers.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	not sure of you budget or taste here - when my first child was born I drove a 4 door Cavalier and it was great - great on gas,  handled great, plenty roomy for us|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee and love how much room I have for my son and his stuff. It's fairly good on gas, and not a really large SUV.|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	A nice car would be good. I like my Toyota Camry. It is very roomy and practical and still fun to drive.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	First I just want to say that you NEED to get rid of one of the 2 door lol. I have a 6 yr old and didn't plan on having more kids so I got the sports car. Well things changed and now I have a 4 month old and it is a pain getting her in and out of my 2 door Grand Am. Unfortunately my credit is so crappy there's no way I am getting another car loan anytime soon so I'm stuck.  :(    My sister has 3 kids and has a new Pontiac G6. (She was driving a 2 door Honda Civic and THAT was rough lol.) It's a little tight with 3 kids so she's looking for a minivan but a G6 is probably perfect for just one.    As far as an SUV goes, my fiance has a 2002 Jeep Grand Laredo and it's very nice. Tons of room and very safe but not too big to drive. Decent gas mileage as well.
LTD0qL6Yaa	Even the early HPT reccomend you wait until 10 days past ovulation to get a accurate result. I am also 6 days past ovulation and i am so impatient that i took a test today and not to my surprise it was negative. I know i have tested too early but i'm so eager to know. Baby dust to you..... If we both are pregnant our babys would be due on the same day 24th October!!!!|`|jpJ0SZBdaa	You would start your period about 14 days after ovulation.

nrqWwQBXaa	all kids do that at times. some one once told me that the people that look and shake there heads are the ones that dont have kids. if they did they would understand?|`|UUpsa35Daa	All little kids have those moments, it's not just yours or just the spoiled brats of the world. Once kids find something fun, they want to keep doing until they decide they're bored with it. They're definitely not the happiest of campers when they're not allowed to keep on doing something they want to do. But that's how they learn.    If you want to hear about a spoiled brat though...    Last year, i took my 3 year old cousin to the store because she wanted to go shopping with me. She's usually very well behaved, just likes sitting in the cart and likes to hold little things that we plan to buy. Well on this outing, she wanted out of the cart so i told her she could walk beside me for a little bit but she had to hold my hand. She did for 10 minutes and was perfectly fine. But then i made the mistake of passing by the toy section and she said she wanted to go see the babies. I told her not today, that we can come back anther day (her mom was expecting her back). She pouted and i told her no again and all hell broke loose. She started yelling and crying and pulling at my hand and then she just laid down and the floor and was kicking her feet and pounding her hands. People all over were looking and i don't believe i was ever a deeper red then i was then. I got a few good bruises on my stomach from her feet after i picked her up but i finally got her to settle down and explained a number of things to her. We ended up putting 2 of the snacky foods she was going to get back and left the store as quickly as possible.    That was quite the day.|`|j2mRop0laa	The people shaking their heads are fuggin ignorant. Toddlers have *actual breakdowns*. They get to the point where they literally just lose their minds for a moment. Tantrum, anyone? It happens. It's natural. Of course there are things you can do to stop them from acting like that at age 4 and 5 and beyond, but expecting perfection from a child is unrealistic and CRUEL. I have given people very dirty looks right back if they shake their heads at my kids. Idiots.    And yeah.. it has happened to me A LOT! Not anymore thank goodness. They are great now. But that toddler stage.. ugh..i don't miss it.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	If they were looking at you so what then they never had children but no you should not have put her back on. My kids behave well because from a very early age when we went to the store and they would cry because they wanted something I would NOT give it to them. I don't care what people did/said. If I were to give in to please others then my boys would still do the same thing as they got older. Next time smile at those rude people and DONT let her have her way because (sorry to say) she will turn into a brat.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	they were shaking their heads at you thinking "spoilt" is a word|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	shes 16 mos old, its normal.  common, depends on the childs temperament but normal nevertheless.  strangers should know better.  if they don't they are ill informed about young children.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	I'm sorry but I'm still laughing I feel for you but, I would have just put more money in the machine have a good evening.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	My daughter knows where every stores bathroom is in like a 100 mile radius from home. It used to be when she was younger she would go to the bathroom at every store we went to. She would start out calmly saying she had to pee. Within a minute she would scream 'I gotta poop'  and would not stop until in the bathroom.|`|FiUprYsvaa	It happens.   I am embarrassed by the human race.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	my kids cant really embarrass me, I just think they are kids and will throw fits etc, but one time when my oldest was 3 and almost pottytrained( I mean I though the was but I guess he wasnt) we took them to mcdonalds and they were playing in the slides etc and of course my son peed all over the play equipment, all the way on top so there really was no way for me to squeeze myself up there to clean it up so I had to go ask the employees to clean it up. (We told them about it 3 times and 20 min later when we left no one had come yet so watch out where your kids play at mcdonalds....) And yeah there were about 5 other families at the time too... they were all really nice about it though :)|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Of course, kids will act up from time to time. Especially when you are taking them away from something fun.  Although it is hard, just don't put her on the rides again when you don't have the time to put a few coins in.  I always believed in the avoidance factor if I could.|`|AA10943329	lmao. For me it was because I got him to walk across a stone path as the pusher couldn't wheel on it. He sat on the path refusing to move and screaming. I walked off thinking he would follow but no . I had to go back and get him and carry him up to the car when his screaming got louder and he stiffened up completely so I could not strap him in his seat. I was waiting for people to come out and check I was not murdering him the screaming was so bad. It was one of only 2 tantrums he ever threw (honestly can't remember the other one now) and he is not a spoilt brat. All will be fine. She is just beginning to become her own little person and wanting what she likes. As long as you don't give into the tantrums she will be fine. She will just learn that screaming does not get her what she wants. Give in once and she will learn screaming gets you what you want|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I'm not trying to come across as rude (I hope!) but I just wanted to share my honest opinion. :) Basically, I agree with aronb3. That kind of behavior is common because it's common for parents not to take charge and handle the situation in a correct and controlled manner.     I believe that as soon as a child is old enough to comprehend right behavior from wrong behavior, then they are old enough to be punished for it. The younger you start, the easier it will be, opposed to when they are older. Consistency is key, never punish in anger, and always express love.|`|xPgKWIigaa	ah LOL!!!! That happened to me waiting for our turn at pixie photos. We thought while we were waiting, they could have their first ride.   BIG MISTAKE!!!!  It took forever to get them back in the pram - and they pulled the same stunt as your princess - but then wouldnt co-operate in getting any photos taken. The photographer actually cancelled the session and rescheduled!!!  So if your raising a spoilt brat - then i'm raising 2!!|`|83205fb34700949ba53315bffc459748aa	it happens from time to time... but i'm the same way, i get embarrassed if my daughter screams or whines in public, but most of the time she's an angel.. don't worry... all kids go through it..|`|wo9goWXUaa	If you are not disciplining the child then yes, you are raising a spoiled brat. As I answered in a previous question, the same "geniuses" that teach against spanking (or listen to those that teach against it) are the very ones I see in the grocery store dealing with this type of situation. The key is that the spanking must be administered with love, never out of anger, and you must be consistent.

Im sorry you have to go through with this bull but yeah.. life sucks. Anyways I know you said you already tried talking but every time she throws something like that that your bro has autism and what not, just keep saying you shouldn't treat him diff just becuz of that. And if she doesn't listen adn doesn't say anything.. just keep yelling it and saying it over and over until it gets to her. If it doesn't , just leave and go to your room. I know it sounds harsh and mean , but this way she might understand how it feels for you.    Maybe talk to your dad? You didnt mention him so Im not sure if he's in the picture or not. If he's not, Im sorry for mentioning it.    Talk to teachers, guidence counselers?
CRVi3YsOaa	When i got pg with my last daughter, i knew i wasn't that far along, becuase i had been doing weekly HPT and i didn't call her until it came back +. But from my last period to the time i got my bfp i was suppose to have another period, but i didn't hence the weekly testing. I don't think that them having trouble with the machine is anything to worry about. My dr moved offices and thier equipment didn't always cooperate. And since you are so early your dr might wait to put you on prenatals. You can get them over the counter and for some people who get sick with rx prenatals, my dr said that they recommend a vitamin like the flintstones (2 a day) in place of the prenatals, so that way you are getting some vitamins. hope this helps, and don't stress too much, that is not good for the baby  with all of my kids they did an untrasound early just to verify dates, to have a better idea of how far along you are, and to make sure they have the right due date|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	just think positive.  It will be ok.  My doctor didnt prescribe me any prenatals either.  I just went to wal-mart to buy some|`|G7EUr6kCaa	nowadays you are expected to buy your own prenatals, and if you are worried you should switch docs|`|HGDVgyJTaa	Some docs dont prescribe prenatals, you can buy your own at any store. I actualy prefer store bought ones cause the ones from the doc made me sick. I wouldnt worry to much about the ultra sound, if it's new equipment they may not be fully confident with it yet. You can always get another one done at an imaging place|`|9op65iQVaa	dont worry.  But you should have gotten prenatal pills.  Thats a must.  Get your own over the counter.|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Stop stressing it's bad for your baby.=D  Doesn't seem to be a reason to be worried about miscarriage.  You can buy prenatal vitamins at any pharmacy, or even Walmart.  Start taking them asap!|`|HF2HiUQJaa	Why did you have an internal ultrasound at 5 weeks for? My first pre-natal appt wasn't until 10 weeks and we only listened to the heart beat at that appt. I didn't have an ultrasound until 14 weeks - and that was just a normal ultrasound  Sounds like you are being used as a guinea pig for this new equipment, maybe you should talk to another hospital and ask their opinions as I have never heard of this before.  Doctors won't bother prescribing you prenatal vitamins unless you are deficiant in iron or calcium etc, but you should be taking folic acid regardless.
lGKMa38Oaa	you have a couple problems here.   first of all, it was a VERY bad idea to let him sleep with you. it becomes a habit that is very hard to break with someone that young.   second, sharing a room with an older sibling is not the bast idea becasue the older child destracts him and puts him of course with falling asleep.   until you get him into a seprate room, you need to just lay down the law. its going to put things off course and make things a little hecktic until he gets into the routine. from now on, as hard as it may be, put him to bed in his own bed, at his own time. if he crys, he crys. dont go into the room and if he comes out, put him back in but dont say anthing to him. let him know you mean business or hes not going to listen to you. eventually he will learn to calm himself down and go to sleep. dont break the habit and let him sleep with you, that will only show him "oh mommys a push over. if i cry, i will get my way" if he comes in in the middle of the night, put him back in bed. dont say anything, just walk him to his bed and put him in. it WILL take some time but eventually the habit will be broken.     i know to some parents this sounds mean but you need to show your child that YOU are boss. not them.     trust me. this will work. just give it a try. it will take time but will eventually sink in. but once you start doing this...you will make things worse if you stop and give in.    good luck. :)|`|VEnVl264aa	I am the oldest of four siblings and we all at one point wanted to sleep with mom and dad. At first my mom allowed it with me because my dad was in the military and never home but then my parents decided that wasn't okay so for me and all of my younger siblings they explained to us that we had our own beds and couldn't sleep with mom and dad but if i was scared or whatever and wanted to be close to them i could bring a blanket and pillow and sleep on the floor. I can only remember doing the a few times because eventually I didnt like sleeping on the floor and went to my bed.|`|b6cuytMyaa	um, hi! i'm no a expert parent.  actually i'm not a parent at all!  but when i was little i used to do that.    Ask his doctor if it would be okay for him to have "melatonin".  & when i was little my mom put a really comfy chair in my sister's & my room so that she could sit there and watch TV while we went to sleep. Then she went to sleep in her room. & if his doctor says it's okay for him to have melatonin then you shouldn't have to worry about him waking up in the middle of the night & coming into your room, that stuff will keep him asleep until the next morning! And when i was little i was afraid to sleep in a bed alone so my mom got my sister & i a queen sized be like my mom's and she made it like hers as much as possible so that it kind of feel like we were in her bed.  GOOD LUCK!  i am pretty sure this will work.

33l3blvsaa	naaawww your doing fine hun, im 23weeks & your a bit bigga than me but everyone are diff sizes!! its exciting!! & anyway we can get rid of post baby weight:D|`|YmEGCGtnaa	to me you look just right for your body. i'm a small woman, so when i was 25 weeks, everybody thought i was only like 3 or 4 months. but i was measuring right on track.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    You are measuring great - A bit bigger but thats okay.  You should measure 25 cms from pubic bone to top of uterus where it can be felt.    here is my 25 week shot s  side : http://photos1.hi5.com/0067/677/716/5jKY...  looking down : http://photos1.hi5.com/0070/174/768/WUE2...    God Bless you look great|`|vGHaYp6Naa	everyone grows different. im 20 wks and just a little big smaller than you. so i think youre doing fine!! just means youre eating healthy|`|gG8oyymiaa	You look about the same as me. http://i385.photobucket.com/albums/oo296...   I am 25 weeks also. ^.^ Hope that helped a little bit.|`|sMukgX7Xaa	You should actually measure about as far along as you are. SO if you are 25 weeks you should measure 25 cm from pelvic bone to top of uterus. You can measure a little bigger or smaller and still be okay. But not too much difference cause it could become a concern.|`|14JQ11AUaa	You look a little bit big for 25 weeks, but every female is different!  This was what my tummy looked like at 25 weeks and 1 day.      http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f266/M...|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I'm 25 weeks and your a little bigger than me, but each pregnancy is differant.    You look about right.    Congrats.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	you look fine. with my first i was huge like i was carring twins. with my second and third i was a small ball. now with this one i am 15 weeks along and am measuring bigger then i should be. every pregnancy is different.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	im 21 weeks and im bigger than you, and ive only gained 5 lbs... so each person is diff|`|kG6VWsGvaa	It depends on the woman, the baby, and the pregnancy.    You look just about right, considering it's your first baby. The only time you should worry about the size of your baby bump is when the doctor says something's not right.
Xrwvu5Uraa	Any chance that you have sex, protected or not there is a chance of being pregnant. Birth control or any contraceptives(protection) are not 100% effective. Yes those are pregnancy symptoms as well as signs for your period. If you are concerned you could be pregnant, then wait until you have a missed period or irregular period and make a doctors appointment! That is your best bet.    Good luck.  Try not to freak yourself out to much!|`|ixOE0onnaa	you would be pregnant if you have pains! my mother have pains you know what happen! she got pregnant.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	It's possible. Take a test in about a week or two to be sure.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Honestly any time you have sex they're is a possibilty youcan get pregnant. For good news though you guys sound smart enough to use protections so what your probably feeling is PMS symptoms. If you still think you missed your period wait a week then take a test. But sounds like your fine :)

hHEMhPZyaa	If you are referring to the DNA test you mentioned in another post, he would have to go to family court and ask for a court ordered test because he believes he is the father. He had better be prepared to foot the bill for the testing. If he is the father, he can then as the court to grant him visitation/custody.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	what test? is it HPT? Try to provide more details|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	What test? A pregnancy test? Go to the doctor.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	If you are talking about fertility test go to a fertility doctor and they test you to see if you are releasing eggs and they will test your partners sperm count and try to narrow it down to help better figure out what is going on. It could be nothing or it could be a number of things or a combination of things. Good luck and I hope this is what you were talking about.
qHykYLQ6aa	Yes, you should dilute it, it's too sugary for them to have straight.  I do 2 oz. juice with 2 oz water for my son.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	Um, you should probably buy the baby juice (which are for babies from 6 months) Normal juice has too much sugar, if you are using baby juice than no, you don't need to dilute it.|`|kxUigIkraa	Because of the way that babies digest carbs, the full serving of juice would really spike his blood sugar. That is why you should dilute it at least by half. Even then, juice isn't really something you should offer every day. I read somewhere that people who have one cup of juice every morning are such and such percent more likely to develop diabetes. Juice is just really high in sugar. It's also not the best for the developing teeth. Whole fruits (or the baby food kind) are best.|`|9xBtHTdCaa	no  for his first few times i know this sounds gross but he might get diarhea and that is only because it is new for him. but that will wear off also put some water in it to reduce this from happening|`|AA10288267	i would dilute it until they are 5 y/o|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes, in fact it's good that you do it every time. You'll save money on juice because you'll have it for twice as long and the baby will still taste the juice and gain the nutrients without a lot of sugar.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Depends on what kind of juice it is...did you buy baby juice? or is it just adult juice? I started my daughter on adult apple juice mixed with equal part water. ( so one ounce juice, one ounce water) I think the ones made for babies and toddlers are already diluted some, but if your child is under age one I would dilute it more.
97e755fe7f3c18b6cabd7abbcfa7ba43aa	She is probably experiencing pms symptoms.   Buy her a pregnancy test if she misses her period. They can be taken the day of a missed period.   Good Luck|`|kxUigIkraa	Sore breasts could be a sign of upcoming period as well. For her to be pregnant from that one minute is REALLY unlikely. Like one in a billion.|`|VuJsQwz5aa	Believe it or not, one minute is all it takes. And just because you did not ejaculate doesn't mean she couldn't be pregnant. When a man is aroused, he secretes tiny amounts of sperm even before he orgasms. Even a tiny drop contains millions of sperm cells and it only takes one to get her that way. It's one reason the "pulling out" form of birth control is unreliable.|`|AA10046969	hahahaha|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	Even though you might not have came inside of her, there's always pre ejaculation. If her period hasn't come yet, then she should get a pregnancy test. It seems as if she might be.     Sore breasts are a sign of pregnancy but they are also a sign of PMS. Really the first sign of pregnancy is missing a period. So if she has, just get her tested and you will know for sure.|`|ppTRwdmSaa	Is English not your 1th lang? It's kinda hard to understand? But good luck with that!|`|bOxlw3ZHaa	well its really hard to say cause there could of been pre jaculated ***, but the sore ness in her breast are probably her getting ready to start her period, if she doesnt start in say 2 weeks from now which she probably will in the next couple days get a pregnancy test and have her take it. plus her periods dont even sound normal if she ejust had one on the 28th she should have one for like 30 days from then...|`|tKfOcgDlaa	If your "thing" got inside of her.....guess what....she is probably pregant.|`|jkDawQVNaa	i dont really get it|`|hHEMhPZyaa	If I'm understanding your post properly, the timing doesn't work out to where sex occurred during her fertile time. If she is thinking she is pregnant, her mind can trick her body into acting odd and not getting her period. If you don't want a baby, ALWAYS use birth control of some for or another.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	If she is pregnant now, with these symptoms you are probably not he father of the baby.  If she had her period on the 4th she ovulated around the 18th and became pregnant then not on the 28th.  Best of luck to you.|`|tiWMepyZaa	ya probably|`|kFkV7Yroaa	controlurself|`|KJLFVjoraa	If she is you are one very unlucky person, do a pregnancy test.

In it all b tru to urself and to him , he deserves it and as a frend he'll hav to respect wateva desicion is made.  If u dont want the relationshp, despite the possibility of hurting him, dont ! it will only make the relationshp bcum damage cuz u wud hav lied to him and to yourself.  chill and think about it sum more, there's nuttin rong with goin out jus let him kno u need sum time to process everything.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	this is a parenting section ..not dr ruth tips for kids too young to be dating to begin with|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Why dont you say what you typed here?

AA10239053	I'd make a log cabin. All you'd need would be glue!
ENANtueuaa	I used vent-air with my daughter. They are proven to reduce ear infections and colic, it has something to do with the vent system, and also the angle of the bottle. They are also BPA free just like the liners for the drop ins. I used the drop ins with my neice, and when squeezing the air out the bag exploded lol, so when i had my daughter i chose the vent-air for this reason, along with the other advantages i mentioned above.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You can remove all the air from the liners and the liners are BPA free. I prefer them.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i like the ventaire advanced for younger babies and the dropins for my 8 mo old....|`|MQ34YW28aa	i really like the bag ones. i wish my son would take the nipple but he wont. my mom used them with my brother (we are 12 years apart) and I remember using them with him and they were awesome and very handy.|`|bql2RJzWaa	I don't know which is best, but I prefer to use the bags. The liner collapses as baby sucks, therefore, gets no air. I don't really care for the vented ones.   I guess it's up to you if you want to keep purchasing the liners...|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I like the ones in the bag better because it doesn't make my baby really gassy.|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	They're basically the same except you have to wash the ventaire ones and the drop ins are disposable... i use both just in case i run out of liners i have ventaire on back up. By the way the ventaire bottles are BPA free as well ;)
XcgHH0lLaa	We're in this together. I'm due for AF on the 14th, have a 28 day cycle. BD on the 28th/29th...ovulated on the 29th OR 30th.    I have been having cramps since about 4 dpo. I have tingles in my breasts but no soreness. The only thing I have is extreme hunger (like, painful hunger) and I've also been taking naps.    Good luck to you if you're trying. Let us all know how it goes.|`|x6xOlJfmaa	Maybe it is ovulation cramps. They can happen around two weeks before an egg is released. This does not mean you are not pregnant it just means the opposite ovary may be ready to shed itself from your uterine wall.  If it was fertalized and you became pregnant it would result in faternal twins. I do not know how often that happens.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelschme...    Symptoms and diagnosis  Mittelschmerz is characterized by lower abdominal and pelvic pain that occurs roughly midway through a woman's menstrual cycle. The pain can appear suddenly and usually subsides within hours, although it may sometimes last two or three days.[1] In some women, the mittelschmerz is localized enough so that they can tell which of their two ovaries provided the egg in a given month. Because ovulation occurs on a random ovary each cycle, the pain may switch sides or stay on the same side from one cycle to another.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	have you missed your period yet?  Not all women are the same. Some women have symptoms and some dont have the same symptoms. Don't stress over it too much esp if you are actually trying to have a baby. It may make it harder.

I have a high risk pregnancy this time around and still usually go once a month... sometimes every 2 weeks for additional testing, but unless you're having a complicated pregnancy i dont see why anyone would have to go more than once a month or have so many ultrasounds. Sounds like your doctor is on the right track. Good luck.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Is your sister in-law high risk? that is likely the reason she got so many ultrasounds.  I am high risk and I get them 3 weeks or so since week 18.    People with regular pregnancies generally get from 1-3 ultrasounds.  This depends on your doctor and your insurance.    As far as doctor visits.  It is generally 1 a month in the beginning.  Then once every 2 weeks in the third trimester and during the last part of the third trimester it is every week.  Some doctors have a slightly different schedule, but most all will do something along those lines. Just call your doctor if you have any questions on exactly how they do things.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	1st and 2nd trimester u should see him 1 time every 4 weeks, 3rd trimester you should see him every 2 weeks. i think your 9th month u see him every week.     u get ultrasounds    when u first get pregnant to see the baby  around 8 weeks to see the heartbeat  20 weeks to find the sex and to see if everything is ok  maybe an extra one if your dr just wants to check up|`|VR9KhbEgaa	With my last child I had one done the first time I went in because I was unsure of when I conceived since I had never had a period after having my prior child. I think I was about 9 weeks, then they did one at 20 weeks. That was it, I really was wanting and hoping for another one but no luck since I was a scheduled c-section this time. With my other 5 prior children I had one done around 36 to 37 weeks to ensure the babies position.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	Depends on the doctor. I had several ultrasounds with my first pregnancy, I was going to a private doctor. This time around I lost health insurance so I had to start going to health department, because I can actually afford to pay for their doctor's services ( I get a discount depending on my income). They do not do ultrasounds at all because they believe they are not medically necessary unless there is a complication.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I see my midwife once a month until 28 weeks then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks then every week.    I only get one ultrasound for this pregnancy because I opted out of the 1st trimester screening.

I had 3; one at 9 weeks, one at 19 weeks, and one at 35 weeks. they usually do ur first one around 8-13 weeks, one around 18-22 weeks to check the sex and the measurements of the baby. and they don't always give an ultrasound at 35 weeks I just got one because they thought my son was getting to big(he was 9lbs 1oz at birth). but anyway I hope I helped, good luck.|`|weE5FxCfaa	in this country unless there is a problem you usually only have 2 sonograms, the first one from 8-12 weeks and the 2nd from 17-21 weeks.  in germany they have different ob care then here.  my friend was in germany for most of her last pregnancy and she got them just like your sil did, but they don't do that here.|`|G4qP2gATaa	You go to the doctors office once a month until about week 32 then you go twice a month until about week 36 then you go once a month until you deliver.     I don't know about the ultrasounds.|`|no9N3zjMaa	I've only had 2 ultra-sounds. and as for you appointment that sounds pretty normal, they'll get closer together the farther along you get|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I saw my dr every four weeks until 32 weeks. I will go back in 3 weeks and then I will go every week. Most women only have one ultrasound at 20 weeks unless there is a problem or a question of conception. I don't know anyone that has had one every two weeks unless there is a problem. Maybe they do things different in Germany.|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	That sounds crazy!!   Patients with a normal pregnancy (where I'm from) typically get 1 ultrasound at 20 wks. If they need to estimate the fetal weight than MAYBE a second on close to the due date.   Of course, if there are complications (diabetes, HTN, etc) there will be more ultrasounds. But the majority of my patients have one.|`|B7FL0rdqaa	I'm 26 weeks also, and I have only had 2 ultrasounds. Once at 13 weeks, and once at 20 weeks. I see my doctor once a month, based on your pregnancy I'm fairly certain that's typical.  Unless you're a high risk pregnancy, once a month, or once every five weeks seems perfectly normal.   To me, it sounds like your sister-in-law may have been a high risk case? Once every two weeks for an ultrasound seems like a lot! Also seems expensive if you have to pay for your healthcare with no insurance! If the baby has been healthy, and you aren't suffering any complications then everything sounds fine to me!
b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	We use condoms because I do not want anything messing with my supply. Might not be the most popular, but it works for us.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	teeny beeny- depo doesn't always prevent bleeding, in fact i bled for 6 months straight on it and became anemic. i used the mini pill but i never really feel like i want sex when i am on BC so right now nothing|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Condoms, my supply cannot take the hit!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I just finished breastfeeding, and I was on the mini pill.

(o:  good luck!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Depo-It's great because I have yet to get a period 10 months after giving birth, and according to my OB I will not get one until I stop getting the Depo shots.     There are very negative side effects-Mood swings, increased appetite, PMS symptoms when due for a shot. My milk supply is not great-meaning I have not been able to pump a surplus to freeze-But I have always had enough to fufill my daughter while nursing. I also work full time, sometimes miss pumping sessions at work, and my daughter is 10 months old. But those don't occur in all women. Do your research, so you'll know what's a "normal" side effect.    EDIT: Jillian is correct, it doesn't always prevent bleeding. But for a lot of women, it does. It did for me, and my younger sister who has been getting shots for over 2 years.|`|AA12089586	I'm on the mini pill, but i think i'm noticing it effecting my supply so i think i'm going to stop taking it...  other than that, we still use condoms...
kpnSKV6Eaa	the first ultrasound is actually the best guess.. they are very accurate in the first 3 months. during that time all babies pretty much grow at the same rate.. going by your lmp is not always correct because women sometimes ovulate at different times than they expected.. not always the same, also some women take longer to implant than others so the first u/s would be the best... as for the apr 1st guess, as the baby gets bigger it is harder to get perfect measurements, the baby might look bigger or smaller on the u/s when you get later into the pregnancy... go with the 8th, 90% of pregnancies dont go into labor on their due date anyway and the 8th and the 12th are not that far off|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	I would go by April 1st good luck|`|d35d2a457ae7bd90d17b98358efcd99faa	when i had my first ultrasound they told me that my due date is june 24th when i had my second ultrasound they told me that my due date is june 8th but then i had the baby on may 8th, they said the baby's not premature.( she came out healthy and stuff.)|`|c0KXsM1Paa	i was told july 11th, and had my son june 16th. he was white when i had him prom being premature, but he is perfect now! congrats!|`|4nAl9Y7Baa	All three of my kids came earlier than the due date my doctor gave me.

Congratulations on your new bundle of joy and Good Luck!!|`|Z0GLItjjaa	well with my first, they told me i was due march 16th and i had him on march 3rd.  my second i was due on april 12th and i had her on april 11th(thats that i went in that morning for an exam and she told me i wouldnt be having the baby for another week)lol.my last one i was due march 15th and i had her march 12th...so honestly from my experience it can happen anytime...usually one week before and one week after your due date.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	LMP- earlier due dates are usually the most accurate|`|QVg9KB1vaa	I would go with the one based on the LMP.|`|jcXSNjowaa	last menstrual period.    first pregnancy i was due august 6th and i had my son july 26th induced    second pregnancy i was due september 14th, i went into labor the 14th and had him at 4 am the 15th

qOBYfdlBaa	You sound like you could possibly be pregnant....I had EVERY single one of those symptoms but also had sore breasts, and most of them were about a week before I was suppose to start when it got closer to where my AF was suppose to start I was also running to the bathroom thinking I started but never did.  I took 4 cheap dollar store PT's the day after my missed period and all were positive.  If you can be patient then I'd wait it out and make sure.  Good luck!|`|6igjX2cnaa	could be hun! AF was due for me 2/8 but I just got my BFP this morning at 11dpo.  I've had cramping and sore breasts like crazy!  I also got a few rounds of nausea.  You could get a positive this early, but of course the more you wait, and af doesn't show, the greater the chance for a positive :)  Best wishes hun!!|`|qsikZ3Vzaa	you mite be preggos but maybe ur head is messing with you but go ahead and test good luck hun :) wish you the best|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	You basically have every symptom i have!!!! I am due for AF on the 14th Feb so i will have to wait a little while longer to test.  If i am pregnant this will be   5 so i definitely remember feeling like this with some of my others. Baby dust to you....|`|MOsStEbqaa	Really sounds like you could be. Go ahead and take a test and you can always wait to tell him on v-day. But it also sounds like af could be coming to. I would wait till at least the 8th to test. I wouldn't want you to waste the money on a test if you didn't need it. Good luck and baby dust.
M9wAOlk3aa	well you cant just wait around for the feeling of motivation to strike you need to just get started and once you start seeing results that will motivate you to continue   perhaps you need to put little one in the stroller and go for a brisk walk to longer the better or otherwise buy a denise austen video /dvd  and pop little one in the cot then go for it, they may grizzle a little but least they are safe and you cant still keep an eye on them   my mans just like that   so eating is okay just make sure to give yourself at least half an hour a day to exercise you deserve it !!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	put that baby on your back ,,and HIKE.|`|6e541cf93eb873a02de583d69ccab728aa	Well...I am 6 wks PP...I have always had the motivation to workout and be thin but now that the baby is here...different story!! lol. Now I just wanna be with her, enjoy her every little moment and when she's sleeping I'm usually doing something around the house b/c I am a neat freak so theres not much time really...but today I am proud of myself b/c I actually got on the treadmill for 45min... so it's a start and hey my baby's only 6 weeks so I guess I still have time. Put a picture of you at your best weight on the fridge and when you go for the ''bad'' stuff you will def. get the fruit instead! it works for me =) good luck and yes you CAN DO IT!!|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	I saw this on a talk show one time. I don't know if you could find it on the web or not, but they incorporated exercising and playing with your baby. Like lying on your back with your knees up, put him on your shins looking down at you while you do crunches. If he likes to be held, go up and down a flight of stairs with him. He will probably get a kick out of the bouncing. It will be tiring but worth it. I do it with my twins now.     Look online to see if you can find some recommendations about exercising WITH baby. Also, some health clubs offer classes like this. You could look into that too. Good luck!!|`|OjHFN4imaa	Don't be so hard on yourself!!! You will get the hang of it eventually. It takes time to get a program that works for you. Keep trying. See if you can do something while baby has a nap, or just strap him on in a carrier and go for a walk. He will most likely sleep and you will get a better workout from carrying the extra weight of the baby. What I did to lose 70 lbs was once my daughter was on the school bus, my son and I would watch cartoons and I would ride my stationary bike for 7miles. I did this 3-4 times a week and watched my portion sizes. The food part came later..the biking was first though! Good Luck!    You husband might need a more forceful reminder. You made this baby together and need to take care of him together. It CAN NOT be a one way street or you will get pissed and resent him..been there done that!! My husband now lets me sleep first and takes the baby so I can do that. He took the kids out on weekends so I could sleep in while I was pregnant. It just took me to go on strike and give up. I literally broke down and cried and cried. I told him without getting mad..just sad, what I needed from him. It took him a while to get it, we are on our 3rd child, but he does awesome now! I did have to be patient and tell him again every once in a while too. Dads grow into parenting..and sometimes they need some guidance. Do you have any mutual friends that have kids that may offer any help for your hubby? Of course a last resort might be to buy him a few "becoming daddy" books as an evident message..see if that works!|`|sAAnquoTaa	Let me know if you figure it out. My daughter's 7months and I can't get motivated either. I was for a while and was doing great, but then she got more toys and stuff and we didn't have room for me to even exercise anymore. I'm blind and can't take walks or run with her either. I'd love to do the ones on DVDs, but I can't see them and can't understand what they're saying to do.|`|3DcpbCrOaa	Find a picture of yourself that you think you look really good in and put it everywhere!  Look at it all of the time and remind yourself how good you felt about how you looked.  Put it on the mirror in the bathroom, put it on the fridge - everywhere!  Think about it when you want to eat/not work out.    I know what you mean - I have a  hard time motivating myself to be healthy.  My death trap is afternoon/evening snacking - kills me!!     Good luck and congrats on the baby!!  It really is a miracle of life!|`|XpZA6nZNaa	Well, I think that you are a first time mom...I can tell even though you didn't tell us.  Your body will adjust. It has only been nine months and to lose baby weight takes time. You should work on toning your muscle. Your tummy muscles are very weak right now from having a child. It's normal. So, do exercises and include your baby! He or she is a great weight lifter! Search the internet for some ideas on moves you can do with your baby. Your child will love it too. And sleep when your baby sleeps. Proper sleep helps maintain your health. It is not all about eating right although that's a part of it. Honestly, it sounds like your stressed more over your bf or husband than anything though. I think you should work out that aspect of life before anything. Your relationship, not only with your bf, but as a family as a whole id MUCH more important than your figure.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	OK, your hubby sounds fairly incompetent so your not gonna get any help his end. What I would suggest is that you care for your baby while your baby needs you - if this makes you tired then so be it, all you have to think is that it won't last forever, he is already 9 months, he will probably be walking soon and once they start walking they completely change, it tires them out to the point where they no longer need to be rocked to sleep and they begin to sleep right through the night (and sometimes even sleep in)   As for the binge eating - I know where your coming from with that problem, it's so hard to stop eating when, for the whole 9 months of pregnancy, you got to eat whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted and to suddenly stop is a very hard thing to do.  What I started to do was drink a low fat iced coffee before one of my regular meals, what this did was fill me up enough to not want to eat much of my meal, so I was only eating very small servings and filling up on it thanks to the iced coffee. I lost 8kg in the first month of doing it and i did not do one bit of exercise or stop eating the things i loved - because I never felt like eating them. I now weigh 50kg and am very happy with my weight.
BWL2P49oaa	Unless your water breaks, I would avoid an induction.  New research shows that there are more risks involved than previously thought.  Make sure you get a CLEAR answer as to   WHY if you dr decides they should induce.    http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12299921...|`|44OH7Si6aa	If you go into labor meaning you have regular contractions 5minutes apart and lasting 60 seconds, they will break your water. Will they break your water to induce labor, probably not. More than likely, unless there is a problem, your doctor is going to want you to get to at least you 37th week, possibly even 38. It doesn't sound like you need to be induced though, your body is preparing itself it may be better to let it go into labor when it is ready to.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Hmm...I'm not sure. Sounds like they might, but I'm no doctor sweetie. I guess it depends on your doctor and alot of other health risk like high blood pressure and how the baby is doing...Sorry can't really answer this question but I tried =)      Good Luck!|`|weE5FxCfaa	nope, they will not promote labor until you are at least 37 weeks.  been there myself.  my son came on his own at 36 weeks 3 days, but that was after 30 hours of labor because the dr's wouldn't do anything to promote what they considered preterm labor.|`|sYsfI856aa	Most hospitals/doctors won't induce until you have passed 40 weeks. Definitely not til you are past 37weeks.    So long as your bag of waters in intact there is no risk of infection, so they will probably do nothing until your waters break on their own or you go into active labor on your own.    Once you are at 40weeks in the same condition they would most likely do more about it.    36weeks is still considered pre-term. 37-42 is considered term.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	from my own personal experience, i was 36 weeks and had dilated 5 cm so from there he broke my water for me. but before 36 they will try to stop your labor. like you said, now you are just waiting on your water to break.|`|no9N3zjMaa	Doctors let you labor naturally as long as possible, They put you on something to get you dilating before breaking your water, what sense is there in breaking the water if you're not closer to pushing|`|o0zA3QByaa	nope i was like 34 weeks and i was 3 cm dialated and i stayed fine untill past the 40 weeks when then had to induse me.. your ok..|`|TzLxCXm9aa	we have 5boys,think ive been through almost everything. i know it sounds bad but have sex itll do the job, just dont do it after your water breaks. when you have sex it makes your uterus contract putting you in labor and will probally break your water to. ive had to be induced at 35weeks on the day with 2of mine. itll be ok|`|Gr78AFvyaa	they won't induce you until you are considered full-term unless your water breaks and you are not progressing. you could stay 4 cm dilated until you are 41 weeks!!! Ive been dilated 1 cm and effaced 60% for 3 weeks now and ive lost my plug...they talked about inducing me next week at 41 weeks but also because I have a medical condition. why would you want to take baby out this early anyway!?! baby still has some brain and lung development to go.|`|ypDDpIlCaa	I work in L&D and there is no way they would help your labor along by breaking your water or by starting pitocin. We send people home at 5 cm dilated and they could go 2 weeks before they come back in real labor
2irmTjQ3aa	she was ovulating so yes there is a chance, even if you did not ejaculate in her she could be pregnant. And the whole hot tub/pool thing and the peeing... that makes no difference at all.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	If you got any of your semen in her she could be pregnant, and being in a pool or hot tub is not protection. If she is right about to have her period then she is most fertile right now. Better get a pregnancy test to be sure.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	the chances seem low, but still possible.    Always wrap it up! ;)
28ddd666909e979096f19163d5072423aa	Ya guys can do that a 2nd time... and maybe more depending on the guy. Ya, that had sperm in it too. There is definitely chance your girlfriend could be preggers. Your gf needs to go to her doctor and get a preg test in a few weeks or the morning after pill asap.|`|VS8mactUaa	You can ejaculate a number of times, its called multiple orgasms, lots of people have them, and yes its sperm, and yes there is a definate possibility that she can be pregnant. Jese do your homework, BE RESPONSIBLE.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	uhhh yes she could be pregnant.|`|QVg9KB1vaa	Pulling out is not a good form of birth control.|`|AA10285131	Yes it was real sperm, lol.

If she is then there is still a small chance she could be pregnant.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Uh, yes there was still sperm in that, so she could be pregnant.|`|4GPgH4ZMaa	Sorry, Im not a guy I have no clue about ejaculating twice lol but she sure can get pregnant.

You should've stayed in health class alittle longer.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	yea you can have sex 100 times in a day and the 100 time your still shootin little swimmers so yea it was sperm|`|ggfE4rlvaa	If you didn't know that you can come more than once, then you shouldn't be having sex. Seriously.|`|qBJLuCO0aa	ha... you can ejacute alot more than that hun... yes it was sperm, you have millions and millions of sperm, endless supply.  There is a possiblity she might be pregnant if she was ovulating, talk to her and use this website http://www.ovulation-calendar.net/ to see if she was ovulating at the time...|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Yeah you can ejaculate more than once. Yes every time you ejaculate there is a high number of sperm in each ejaculate but it does lower in numbers the more times you do. It says that you kept on going after you ejaculated the second time and then it says you pulled out. Weather you pulled out or not there is still fluid inside your penis and can come out with each penetration. So therefor she can get pregnant from this.|`|MXXOICquaa	u idiot you can ejacualte more than once are u crazy there isnt a time limit on it either so yes it was sperm and yes she could be preggo|`|rxcgQ6W5aa	better have her get checked! better safe than sorry|`|AA10552086	Of course there was sprem in the second ejaculation.  How old are you?|`|HyVkOrL1aa	wooow... didnt you take sex ed???|`|oJdyBSDHaa	ya she may be pregnant tell her and have her take the test. and ya you busted again. this just means you can keep it up for a long time|`|8TublJMCaa	hell ya dude....    my advice:  TAKE YOU GIRLFRIEND TO SEE A DOCTOR|`|4c3d98ae9cf7e80862067b4993edd82caa	Dude, you're not an idiot. You were just under-informed.    This happened to me before, except the first time I wasn't having sex, just masturbating. I don't know what causes continued erection after masturbation- whether it's the level of arousal, stamina, or diet [one's nutritional diet has a lot to do with sexual performance].    Yes, it was sperm. And sometimes this happens. One time I was able to keep going with my gf, though it wasn't a great idea, since my penis still had residue left over from the first ejaculation.    Apparently, people who are more "skilled" at sexual activity [i dunno what other term to use, haha] are pretty adept at ejaculating more than once.
2hz5fRU9aa	Yes. I have also walked naked down the street and someone saw me.    NiF|`|jrCZ6fadaa	no, but i've done it.... heck why not?|`|gBEq0zo5aa	No. Would you say. uh.....

I like Catalina Rose.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Catalina Bella-Rose---most definitely! Catalina Love is really cheesy...|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Catalina Love.

Have you considered Catalina Rose?|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Catalina Bella-Rose is better--Catalina Love insists upon itself a bit too much.|`|b01a7656f4dfb82f7362e0477bcef88caa	I like Catalina Love for a change...it's nice!|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Bonnevella....|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Catalina Rose|`|otFCWMuUaa	id go with catalina love..    catalina bella-rose is a bit much to say...|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	How about Catalina Rose?|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Catalina rose no bella|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	Catalina Love|`|YEc66bBSaa	Catalina Bella-Rose sounds prettier:)
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Out of those Names I like Lola Skye best..|`|9kdUmttPaa	I like Lola Grace. Have always loved Skye. I don't care for Cordelia or Olivia. Sorry.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Cordelia Rose  Olivia-Rose paired with a name like Cordelia is too much|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Olivia Skye is pretty. :-)|`|we0xPfYLaa	I love the name Lola Grace.  Very pretty!  I like Olivia Rose also.|`|wsHgMp93aa	I really like Lola Grace and Lola Skye|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	Love Lola Skye and Lola Grace, i dont like Cordelia or Rose    how about Olivia Grace|`|KOcCenrEaa	Cordelia is very pretty but I don't like it with Olivia.    I think Lola is a horrible name for a baby.  Little Lolita is what it makes me think.    I love Skye but I told you how I feel about Lola.|`|cWqVZ33laa	Lola Grace is pretty..i don't really like Cordelia sorry!    Did you know that in Mexico Lola is like a nickname for Aurora?? You could consider Aurora too! :D|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	Lola just makes me think of bad bad things that should not be in any related to a baby.  Cordelia is better, but it still sounds like a cartoon character.  How about Olivia Rose?|`|UbNOv4a1aa	of them i like olivia rose best .    lola- she was a show girl with pretty ribbons in her hair and her dres cut down to there!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Lola Grace is BEAUTIFUL  Lola Rose is cute too.    In my opinion, Skye and Olivia should only be used as first names. and Cordelia is horrible.    good luck.|`|8nNF3t65aa	I like Lola Grace better than Lola Skye. I like Cordelia Olivia, Cordelia Rose and Olivia Rose. Cordelia Olivia-Rose is too much.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Lola Grace-I prefer Lila Grace but still very pretty 8/10  Lola Skye-Unique and interesting 9/10  Cordelia Olivia-Rose-I think that Olivia-Rose is all a bit much with Cordelia. What about Olivia Rose as the first and middle name or Cordelia Rose? 5/10    Hope I help ;)|`|AA11227589	Lola Rose|`|5TKy9Fhhaa	I really like cordelia, it's quite unique.  Olivia is really common right now it's in the top ten girl names just fyi. Grace and Rose are really popular middle names, they're like the new ann and marie. So I say Cordelia Skye is prettiest.|`|qVt6wJqMaa	Cordelia Olivia-Rose is so pretty|`|HFhZc7BAaa	I like Lola Grace!|`|9IOsFjX9aa	Olivia Rose|`|5rXQpDAJaa	I loveeee Cordelia, but Olivia Rose makes it too long. Pick one middle name!    Lola is a cute name too!|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	Lola Grace is super cute.    What about Lola Rose.|`|d3IcVDNFaa	I like Lola Grace and Cordelia Skye
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Apparently she wants you to be the 'perfect' child. Good in school but somehow able with magical powers to have an amazing social life as well.    I don't get parents like that. I think they are trying to live their child's life instead of letting their child live their own. Do what makes you happy. If you keep doing things just because you think someone wants you to. You'll end up like my friend Joe. He is 20 years old and has just realized that,his life is his own,and he should be doing the things that he wants,and not just parent pleasing!|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	All any mom can want is for their child to be happy & successful. You are stuck between the two.     Don't blame her, she probably blames herself enough for the both of you.    Try to find a happy medium, but remember school is  1.     When I was in school I tried to take my dad's advice, "These should be the happiest years of your life." So I partied. I regret it. School should have been  1.

PS - i prefer the spelling Sebastien...|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Sebastian reminds me of a little boy who has brown hair, blue eyes and very delicate if not girly features but not in a bad way. He has musical talent and is very smart.|`|5kiOaeOVaa	the crab from the little mermaid. Wearing a tie...|`|iO4lpwiVaa	I think of Sebastian Bach  then the Blair witch  then the little mermaid
Xrwvu5Uraa	You would not feel pregnant this early if you were to be.  Schedule a doctors appointment so you can get a 100% result.  Good luck.|`|iGiLPpEXaa	I am 32 weeks pregnant with my thired daughter and that is what happened to me this time!  i would take test!!!! Good luck!|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	You could. Go to the doc good luck
G7EUr6kCaa	depends on the state, i got pregnant at 16 and my man was 21, but it depends on the state, usually the limit is 4 years so technically you were safe at the time, and unless someone (like a parent) presses charges then you fine. and if it helps we're still together to this day:) 5 years in april!|`|GNNtomgUaa	if this really is true...congrats. yeah your life is gunna be hard for the rest of ur life but when you see your baby it will be TOTALLY worth all the pain and questioning your going thorugh now...WITH OR WITHOUT ur Boyfriend....|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	no...well at least not in AR if you are 17 you are considered an adult in this situation|`|B7FL0rdqaa	Unless your mother/father is a psycho and charges him with statutory rape, he won't get in any trouble. It depends on where you live also, if you're in Canada he can't get in trouble unless he raped you and you were willing to testify in court that rape was the case. I don't know about US laws though.|`|mG6Pu12Paa	A lot depends on which state you live in.  Different states have the age of consent different.    Good Luck|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	Just don't do it I had my first child at 17 with a older guy to ,guess what I haven't sen him since she was born 11 years ago and have not received one penny either, and she's his splitting image. I thought we were so in love, we all do at your age. its too hard|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	well if it was consensual sex then no he can not "get introuble"  and from the sounds of it, it sounds pretty concensual.  congrts.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	A 22 year-old has no business with a 17 year-old, sorry but that's just wrong. He could have at least waited until you were 18..then you wouldn't have to ask this.|`|9op65iQVaa	yes, unless you say it was consentual.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes he can  he had sex with a minor.   you got pregnant when you were a minor.|`|gyoylefvaa	Yes, he'll get in trouble.    thanks to you and he too to get involve with a 17 girl.|`|URuzNGcyaa	depends on the laws of the state/vountry  16 is the age of consent here

21Lnhdfeaa	The best rule to follow in this is to work as long as you feel comfortable working.  As long as you don't have any conditions that cause issues for your pregnancy, you can work as long as you want to.  A friend of mine worked until the day before her daughter was born, my sister worked until the day she was due, I stopped working a week before, but I had other health issues.  If you're healthy and your doc doesn't advise against it, you can work as long as you want to without any harmful effects on the baby.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Some people go the whole way until they have their baby. I personally took two weeks before my due date (which is in a week and a half... still waiting!!). It totally depends on how you feel and what your doc recommends.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hey there! My due date is just one day before yours! Anyways, I really think that depends on how you are feeling. I work on my feet all day giving massages at a spa and that's starting to get really difficult for me to do, so I am taking off at 36 weeks. I'm hoping I make it that far!    Seriously though, if you want to work the whole time, you are healthy, and feel up to it, why not? It does make the time go by faster! Good luck to you! :]|`|wcYRxDw2aa	I stopped at 36 I walked and was on me feet all day.  I gave myself 4 weeks I thought.  Ask you obgyn|`|Gr78AFvyaa	I quit around 34-35 weeks and I worked at a pizza place same hours you did. quit when your body tells you to quit...eventually you just wont be able to do it anymore. It got to the point where I wouldn't be able to walk by the time I got home and had intense back pain so I quit. also, ask you doctor because you want to make sure that you are in good health to continue working and standing on your feet like that. remember, when you are standing that long you are taking away from blood flow to the uterus!! you need to make sure both you and baby are in optimal health.    EDIT: money isnt worth you or your babies health. I ended up on bed rest due to possible pre eclampsia anyway so I made the right choice by quitting...based on what you said you should too. money comes and goes and besides, who has money in this economy anyway?! there are always programs like WIC to help you out with food, formula and dipars in times like these.|`|gyoylefvaa	Well, that is funny.  I quite working 2 day before i when to labor.    the reason was that day a was bleeding not much but my husband toll me to stay at house. and I was working 11:00 am to 8:30 pm or more like 9:30pm. but I join my job.    maybe the end of day my body hurt but a was happy don't my job.  all my pregnancy was working the same like a never was pregnant my bosses toll me to not tke easy but that's not me. I'm a hard worker and a know myresponsiblee.    But do what you need to do and Good luck.|`|cWP73qEsaa	ive had 3 kids and i worked right up to the last week before giving birth. i think its up to you and how u feel. if u have a healthy no risk pregnancy keep working its good to keep urself active and sane. lol once the baby comes work is just not going to be the same.
44OH7Si6aa	Sounds like she isn't really facing what her situation is. She has bonded with this guy over the fact that they have a child, which is very normal. However, she may not see him for the way he really is right now, it sounds like he is using her a bit, but eventually she will tire of it and move on. Just give her time and be there every time she wants to blow off some steam.|`|uQD9POkIaa	NO WAY
8oAlBL91aa	Yep, I was right I had that gut feeling it was a boy and I saw this little thing and said what's that and she said I think that's a boy lol.     With my first I really didn't think of it that much. My dad insisted it was a girl until the day he was born lol. Actually he is doing that again lol. We have been buying boy clothes and he keeps saying your going to have to return that lol. But truthfully I like boys they are so much fun not that I wouldn't mind having a little girl but I'm just so used to monster trucks and sponge bob that I don't know if I would have so much fun with barbies and baby dolls lol.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I asked a question like this a few weeks back because I wondered how many people who just KNEW they were right.  I just KNEW I was having a boy from the moment I peed on that stick, and I was right!  I have had several friends who just KNEW they were having a girl then it turned out to be a boy...      I have a good friend who is due a month after me and she KNEW she was having a girl from the beginning and she was right.  I guess some people have the gift, and some don't? lol|`|WPI0Z47saa	I was right the first time and wrong the second.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I just knew my first was a boy and I was right.     I had the same type of feeling for my second being a girl and I was right too.    This next baby (due this month) I had a feeling she was a girl and I was right yet again!     It could have been mothers intuition for me but then again I did have a 50/50 chance of being right each time. Maybe I'm just a good guesser. :)|`|AA12000741	all of my dreams were about a lil boy..i was convinced i was having a boy...i had my u/s at 20wks and turns out i am having a girl so my feeling was wrong...im very excited to have a lil girl...just strange that my intuition was wrong...i have had them double check a few times just because i still had a feeling it was a boy...|`|MDfleEXWaa	Congratulations , Im in my 23rd week and initial weeks of my pregnancy i was sure to have a boy and then later was hoping for a girl but knew deep down its sure going to be a boy and like wise in my 20th week scan we found its a boy. I did feel little sad but was joyous knowing its a boy cause thats what i thought of initially when i was pregnant :) congratulations happy name finding now :)|`|wBpennsMaa	I thought I was having a little boy and I am having a little girl.|`|HUQQzph2aa	I always thought I would have a girl first, even before I got pregnant. During the begging of my pregnancy that feeling of a girl grew stronger and my feelings were right.     I also have a feeling my next baby will be a girl...I'm not pregnant yet so we'll see in the next year or so ;)|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	I was told so often it was a boy,i belived and when i had a girl,well what a shocker!  go with a open mind try to not hope for one or the other.  xx|`|5b21e8a85edaf6c3aa18dba3f2d440c0aa	i was wrong. i thought a was going to have a boy and it ended up twins. i thought this second time it was a girl and its a girl and a boy|`|aEmdURPTaa	I only have one child so far.  We wanted a girl, so we followed the Shettles method.      Since I was wearing the baby quite high, people were all telling me I was going to have a daughter.  My feeling, that of my husband and also of my mother, was that I was expecting a daughter.  That feeling was still there the morning of the 17th-week ultrasound.    Well, guess what?  T'was indeed a daughter.  The ultrasound was very clear about it.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	With my first I wanted a girl so bad, but I had more of a feeling that it was going to be a boy.  I now have a handsome 21 month old boy :)  Also I am pregnant with my second boy and I knew right away it was a boy and wanted another boy.  Even before I found out I would tell my first about his brother so I was right all along.  Next time I am shootin for a girl, but I already feel I will have another boy lol.|`|W1p6LetFaa	My whole life I just "knew" that my firstborn was going to be a boy, but the instant I got pregnant, I knew it was a girl.  Then at my first ultrasound, the tech told me it was a boy so I was SO confused because I just knew in my gut that it was a girl.  Sure enough, next ultrasound we found out that it was in fact a girl (and have had another ultrasound since then that also confirms this)! So I was definitely right!|`|NgnbtaORaa	Although I am the father, not the mother, I was convinced, throughout all three of my partners pregnancies that each one was going to be a boy.  My partner and I have three beautiful, loving, amazing daughters together.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Nope... I wanted a boy forever but had the STRONGEST feeling that I was having a girl. My little's man's... uh.. little man parts were definitely there though!!!    Congrats and good luck!!|`|afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	Well so far I was right. Everyone (who cared one way or the other) wanted a girl and I kept telling them since it was my child he would be a boy just to spite them and I just knew he was a boy. Well the ultrasound said he is a boy. :) I guess we will find out for sure when he gets here in May|`|Yf9VZunaaa	I'm 38 weeks pregnant with my first, a little boy and I just KNEW he was a boy from the start.  I didn't even feel the need to have the ultrasound confirm it I was that sure, of course we saw anyway and there was no mistaking it!     On another interesting note, way back when my mom was pregnant with me they didn't do ultrasounds unless something was wrong.  All her doctors told her I was a boy because of the way she was carrying and my heartrate but I ended up being her little girl and she still to this day says she knew all along!  I guess so, her baby shower was nothing but pink!|`|6DSyp4ZLaa	I was right both times. I just knew. My poor husband wanted a boy so bad the first time. I knew it was a girl way before any ultrasound. The second I knew was a boy, my husband wouldn't get his hopes up..I was right though|`|TzWkvyctaa	I was positive i was having a little girls and i was right!!!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i had a feeling i was having a girl and my fiance said boy- he was a boy. i didn't mind:) there was no mistaken it on U/S|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	all my sisters had boys. 7 boys and no girls and I figured I would have a boy also so I bought all blue stuff but 3 days before I had my first child they told me HE was a SHE. I was completely wrong|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I have five kids... I was wrong the first time and right the other four times.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I had no idea, but my husband was convinced i was having a girl.  The u/s showed a girl and that's what i had.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	With my first pregnancy I had a boy, but I don't remember if I felt like it was a boy or a girl, I think I felt like it was a girl. This pregnancy I think it's a girl, but I'm not sure if I honestly think that or if I just want a girl so bad that I'm psyching myself out.     My sister has 2 boys, my other sister is having a boy, and I have a boy. I want some bows and dresses running around! LoL|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I never had a feeling about the sex I kept having dreams about the sex, and I knew what I really wanted.

I guessed two boys. I could have bet my life I was having at least one boy. But,no,two sweet little girls and I have had multiple ultrasounds confirming that.Even the rest of the family was wrong.|`|fHjSonssaa	I was right- we thought it was a boy and it was a boy!!|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I was sure I was having a girl and at my ultrasound I found it was a boy!|`|4VFEkqJiaa	My ultra sound showed that I was having a girl baby.    I duly delivered a boy!!!!!   When I had the ultrasound the umbilical chord had got pulled up between his legs giving him the appearance of being female!    The hospital asked if I wanted to sue them but I thought it was a funny story to tell my son as he grew up. Especially since his first baby photo was of him wearing a white and pink polka dot outfit!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i was right! i was so excited.  i have and had always wanted boys and i am having a little boy at the end of may!    i was delighted to find out. my husband was in shock that i was correct. lol
4sjW4Ig5aa	When my son was 5, he started acting out at home and in kindergarten. He was very violent, and out of control. As he was living with his dad and step-mom at the time, and his dad was gone to Iraq and his step-mom was preg, we figured that was the cause. Little did we know.  The neighbors next door to them, had 4 yr old twin girls, and a 5 yr old boy. One of the parents was reading to the boy out of a book about "good touch bad touch" when the boy said he'd already been touched like that.   There was a 12 yr old boy in the neighborhood, who unbeknownst to anyone had been molested by a 14 yr old boy that had already moved away. These 3 children weren't his only victims, my son was one as well, and apparently so were a few more children in the neighborhood.    None of the us thought we had anything to worry about. My son was well supervised or so we thought. And this wasn't a stranger, but a child of one of their friends.     It's never too soon to start laying down groundwork in this area. I wish we had done so earlier. I wish we had understood it isn't just strangers that you have to look out for, the predator can live right next door, and comes in many forms, even a 12 yr old.    It isn't just strangers they have to look out for. It's everyone. Make sure your child understands the difference in good touch and bad touch, and knows they can come to you, and they don't have to allow it.|`|WohnX3voaa	Well this is a biggie! The best thing is to keep it simple.Don't worry give him time. we know the dangers.He doesn't so just try to be patient eventually it will stick..|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Heres what i've been doing with my 3 year old.  probably too basic for your son but i'll offer it anyway.  i've actually addressed the "privates" issue - basically.  I've told her they are hers and hers alone.  the only person allowed to touch her there is mommy if I am helping her wipe.  If anyone tries to touch her she should say "stop thats mine, not yours"  i know it may sound silly but at this point i'm just trying to make her aware of the concept.  i've also had a talk(s) with her about being in public.  she needs to stay with me so I can keep her safe.  (like when she decides to bolt in a store) If shes not with me I can't keep her safe.    i personally can't go any further with that conversation at this point because the child is naturally timid anyway and has a very active imagination and scares pretty easily. I did star this question and hopefully some of my contacts can also answer it cuz I'm curious about this topic too..|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Ha ha ha ha...    Uh, here's the deal, the one's you need to worry about are those in your circle of friends and your family!   Strangers are not the ones likely to molest your child, and while it does happen it's a rare occurrence, in general pedophiles groom their targets and befriend them.       You start out with your child in preparation of protecting them from those that would use their body and defame their innocence by naming body parts with proper name, not being ashamed to talk about the body and how it functions (feces come from your anus, urine comes from your penis/urethra, boys have a penis and testicles and girls have a vulva).   You work on good boundaries and talk about who can touch their genitals - mommy and daddy do when we are cleaning your bottom when we change your diaper or give you a bath, a doctor does when the doctor is examining you but no one else has a right to touch your genitals.    Make sex and bodily functions a topic that is safe to discuss at the dinner table or anytime.   Be matter of fact, and respect their bodies!   If they tell you to stop tickling, stop tickling!   If you spank, stop spanking.    This is about you and your parenting, a child with good boundaries, the language to talk about their body and the understanding of what is okay and what is not okay will not be groomed by a predator - partly because the kid is talking to you about it.|`|NI8D46J0aa	We usually start around 3, but I don't think they really understood until about 5. We talk about it in the car, actually. We do that so they can't go anywhere. We just tell them about the dangers and how some people may try to lure them away with puppies or candy, etc. They seem to understand. My 7 year old just told me the other day, "MOm, if someone tries to take me, I will just kick him in the nuts." I don't even know where he heard that but I was trying not to laugh. I have heard the stranger danger tapes are really good. Never used them myself, though.|`|olF9Hl6saa	I told my son about strangers when he was about 3 1/2 after we watched some show about it on tv. It seemed like the perfect time to explain it in more detail.   He is now 4. While at the store a few weeks ago,  a person in line stuck up a conversation with me. My son proudly decided to announce "Mommy, that's a stranger... you aren't allowed to talk to strangers!". It was cute... but a little embarrassing. At least I know he listens to me.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I started reading the Winnie The Pooh Don't Talk To Strangers book when my kids were two.  It is a really good book because it teaches them about not answering the door, don't talk to strangers, etc.|`|Mn1mODPzaa	Hello Housemom - excellent question, it such a fine line between making them aware of their safety and creating a neurotic child afraid to leave the house.    For me the best approach was to use reality.  Within any given week you will typically find at least one story about a predator in the news.  About once a month at first, less later (I still do it from time to time so there isn't complacency) I would point it out to my daughter and start a dialog with her.  Without trying to scare her into never leaving the house, I would point out that the victim never suspected he/she would be a victim, and then explain things that he/she may have done differently so she could reduce the likelihood of being a statistic.    It took a bit, but it certainly seems to have paid off.  She even managed to help a friend who was about to be victimized by an adult who contacted him through IM and arranged a meeting...the police ended up being there for that particular meeting.|`|otFCWMuUaa	there is a good video out there called stranger danger.. my neice is 4 and loves to watch the video.. it works wonders.. she really has grasped the concept of watching out for strangers and things to do in certain situations..|`|Hi5h9739aa	My kids are 4 and 6.  I have talked to them Numerous of times and I try to drill it in their heads.  This is a subject that I don't care if I scare them a little.  It is a dangerous world today.  They need to be aware of bad ppl out there.  Now the other day when my 6 year old daughter asked about where babies come from...well that got a vague answer with no details lol.  I think that the show Americas Most Wanted has a video out.|`|rISHTfK3aa	This is a very difficult thing to do especially as you don't want to frighten your son.    The only thing you can do is to keep talking to him like what you are already doing. Get some books out of the library and make a point of talking to your sons teacher to find out what he/she does in the classroom. This would be the best way to go about it.|`|AA11348933	Our oldest is four and we've been talking to her about it.  She's having a hard time understanding the concept.  We just have to keep drilling it into her.  We asked her if she would go with Santa Claus and she said yes.  We had to explain to her that the real Santa would never ask her to go with him, because Santa wants her to stay with her parents.

3MVv1uOaaa	As teenagers, our internal clocks change as we're growing. We don't get tired til later which makes us want to sleep in more. On average, a teenager should get 9 1/2 hours of sleep. If you look at it, its so unrealistic. Schools expect us to be up at 6 and be at school at 7:30. It's just crap. I have some sleep problems that aren't related to my internal clock, but all the doctors I've seen think its crazy they want us up so early.     Don't worry, your a completely normal teenager. We just don't get tired until later. But it really sucks.|`|IjNHe4kRaa	not all teenagers do.  i don't. and i'm proud ;]  sometimes just cause they stay up late.  i don't know. i got to bed at 1 or 2 am and i wake up at 10 am.  other people i know go to bed at 2 am and don't wake up til 2 pm.  i don't get it. it's a waste of time, mostly.    -BRiDGEt ;]|`|rpKIjLStaa	because we smoke pot all day  and we like it|`|syiEc7xnaa	not all teenagers do!   i only get like 7 hours a day! : (|`|YJi8CZnNaa	I almost don't sleep on most days so i can't give you a useful answer. :P|`|i3pn4jNcaa	because of hormones. & plus ur still growing.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	I dont know.

XOtOMncwaa	My son goes through those spells sometimes, even when he's feeling well, he just doesn't feel like eating. It's really frustrating because I know the poor things hungry, he just refuses anything I give him, it's only lasted a couple days, and then he makes up for it in the days that follow. But it does happen on occasion, I still have those days where I'm just not hungry, so I guess they do too. But when my son gets like that I just try to offer snacks and stuff in between meals to try to get something in his belly. But he's probably not eating because he doesn't feel well, I'm sure he'll be shoveling it in again here real soon...|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes it's normal to not eat much when nose is stuffed. It's hard when your nose is clogged and you feel icky and your appetite goes away.  It's true for us and for baby too.  Also even when a child is fine, they have changes in their appetites.  It is normal.

We just enjoyed each other and had sex every two to three days or so. We didn't think much about trying and we got pregnant that first month! Sooo lucky.    I didn't have any help from met with acne, weight or periods until i uped my dose to 1500mg... doc prescribed 1000mg but i took an extra one.    It did help my acne no be so red and stopped the blind hormone pimples. I also lost 10kg.    I suggesst that u eat Low GI foods as well, this is what helped me too.    Good Luck.    If u have any more q's email me.|`|Boubyng3aa	I also have pcos and i am taking metformin, i started on 500mg, and i now take 1000mg.

IDK about that.  Understand ur wanting to honor ur friends, but I would try to do that in some other way.  Joseph Michael are ok names.  Also I think that you and your husband should have final say on these names.  I can understand the whole tradition of naming after fathers, grandpas, etc. but it isn't really necessary.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Bob...|`|syrh8J6Vaa	What is the name?  It is easier to help and give you opinions with more info :)    edit-  In all honesty friends come and go.  Family is forever.  Since he is the last namesake I would definatley give your first born son the name of his grandfathers.  I know you said this is your final child but things do change.  I have a son and daughter and got my tubes tied 7 years ago because I was done.  I am know trying to find a way to get a reversal.  I would have never thought then that I would feel this way now.  Franklin Dwaine Galbreathe is a very strong traditional name and in all honesty Falcon Joseph Michael is a little on the odd side.  I would honor the grandpas hun.  Good luck|`|AA11490722	it your child and whatever you and your husband agree on will be best- you need to tell the family that it is your decision.     i like the name you have choosen much much better|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Falcon is an awesome name for a boy. Name your what you and your husband want to name him.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Does your husband carry his father's name and maternal grandfather's name?  If not, if your mother-in-law chose not to use those names when SHE had a chance to name her son, then she lost her opportunity to use those names and has no business pressuring you.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	its up to you and your husband. tell everyone else to butt out. its totally your decision and they have to accept that.    good luck.|`|eidLWi7iaa	jordan|`|gBEq0zo5aa	It is your child- don't let anyone else or anyone's bad feelings name your child for you.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	I don't see a problem in naming your son whatever you want. It is your little one and if you and your husband have already decided then it is decided. I don' think that you should cater to anyone other than you and your husband. As long as the baby has your husbands last name then I don't see a problem with carrying on the family name. It is the last name that matters not the first or middle. That gives your children a chance to use the names. I think the friends that helped so much during the rough times in your life would be greatly honored for your only son to carry each one of their names. I think it is totally up to you and your husband ONLY!|`|q40k1KTvaa	Well, it is your baby.   You're the one that had to carry him, and give birth to him when it's time.   If your husband's mom isn't happy about that, then just tell her you're sorry, but this is your baby.   And I definitely think that the Falcon Joseph Michael is a great name.|`|2nWKxv7Waa	you know what--your mother in law had her chance to name her children. name your son as you choose. and i like the name you have chosen now much better. go with your gut if your mother in law throws a fit she can get over it. she needs to grow up and if she chooses to not be a part of your son's life cause of it--her loss not his.
vue9NOhYaa	If you were going into labor on your own, you would eat normally before labor, so just eat normally. This isn't surgery, it's childbirth, and you need food in your system to get through it!  (Eating does not make it more likely that you'll vomit during transition.)  Eat any light, healthy foods that you enjoy.    EDIT: Somebody claimed that they 'can't' do a c-section if you've eaten in the past 12 hours.  That's nonsense.  Women have unplanned c-sections all the time, having eaten shortly before.  They aren't going to let the baby die because they  have to wait for your stomach to be empty!  They'll do what they  have to do, and accept the vanishingly remote risk associated with anesthesia on a full stomach.(Just as they would if you were hit by a car ... or needed an appendectomy ... or any other unplanned/emergency surgery.)|`|v3LnJycKaa	My dr advises against eating after midnight, when going natural you can eat, in an induction they treat it as a "might need a c-section" if you need a c-section they can not do it until you have not eaten in a minimum of 12 hours...

I was allowed to have jello for breakfast and something to drink.|`|aEmdURPTaa	You know, it really should be your decision more than that of the hospital staff.  Have you drafted a birth plan which makes it specific that you want to be able to eat and drink at your own will during the whole delivery?    It used to be that they forbid eating, but more and more, they realize that it's wrong, that the mother knows better.    I would advise you to eat and drink normally before the induction.  When the contraction starts, you might not feel like eating at all... but you'll need the energy for sure!  And the induction might last longer than you think.  You never really know.      That's what happened to me.  I had a normal breakfast on that day, went to the hospital... and the induction didn't even work on the first day!  So I ate all three meals, plus kept well hydrated.  The day after, I had time to have breakfast and even lunch before the contractions started.  After that, I really didn't feel like eating, until a few hours after delivery.      Eating and remaining hydrated kept me stronger throughout delivery.  And I didn't throw up.      Just follow your instincts on that day! :-)     Good luck!    P.S.  I had ICP too, that's why I got induced.
RLIIhxDhaa	Firstly you need proper medical advise.    I'd have changed his formula ages ago to be honest, I think it's not working for the poor little fella. If you do not change it try making it weaker.     Some watered down OJ might help as well. But use that sparingly.

c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	At 7 weeks or so, your son should be feeding every 3 - 4 hours, spending some time awake, then sleeping until he is hungry again.    If he wakes at 7:30, feed and dress him and maybe play with him until he is ready for a nap   he may sleep until 11:00 at which time you feed him again, have him spend some time awake and put him down for a nap afterwards,   then he may sleep until 2:30 or so, then feed & play again  maybe nap until 6:00 or so then feed, bathe and get him ready for bed, although he will probably need to be fed again before you go to bed, say around 10:00 or 11:00.    At 7 weeks he may or may not sleep from 11:00pm until 7:30am.    At before (and possibly after) each feed you should change the baby's diaper, top & tail him (wash face, hands & bottom) and let him spend a little time without his diaper on so he can kick his legs without clothes on.|`|AA10742362	my dd was never much of a napper.  she still isnt.  she slept alot in the beginning.  its hard to flip their days and nights.  i used to turn on music open all the shades and talk and talk and talk to her.  do some leg exercises like bicycles.  i used to go thru the motions of walking and crawling and running.  even ice skating(hubby is a HUGE hockey fan).  she would sleep til 9 or 11 am and asleep by 9p.  now at 4 months shes up between 7 and 9 am for the day. may take a nap, may not.  usually at least 1 though, time varies and start bed routine at 7 and out like a light by 8.  they say for a newborn/infant nap 2 hours after waking. should sleep like 16 hours a day.  awake for no more than 4 hour stretch.  but like i said mine didnt nap much til about 3 months|`|QcGd8ktAaa	Lower your expectations and learn to be more flexible or it will be a long 18 years.|`|2arZOZWgaa	I recommend giving this article a look-see.     Since babies schedules tend to fluctuate and at seven weeks old a strict schedule is basically impossible baby led scheduling is safe, secure, and helps the child develop trust and habits while giving the care giver some normalcy.      There are a lot of factors involved in considering what kind of schedule will work best for everyone. Are you a stay at home mom or do you plan to return to work? Do you breast feed or bottle feed?     A seven week old will probably want three naps a day. Follow his cues and take it from there. About every two or three hours he will probably be ready to go down. Look for the signs: sudden fussiness, rubbing his eyes, yawns, as he won't necessarily know when he is tired enough for a nap. Look for predicable patterns and then encourage those patterns. Encourage longer feeds and playfulness during the day and shorter feeds and sleeping at night. Start following a bedtime routine. Find what works best for your child in getting him to be relaxed enough to go to sleep. This may mean you need to change it up a bit before you find what works.     Lastly, don't expect miracles to occur at this age. Some children sleep through the night, but most of them do not and it has nothing to do with parenting style. Sleep and routines are a milestone much like crawling, walking, and talking are. Each baby reaches them at different strides.    First one is a long one, but the second two are shorties.|`|zwctZ812aa	Give the routine you suggested a try, but he is so young, there's really nothing that you can do to make him eat or sleep at certain times.  The first months are hard...a lot of babies have their nights and days confused.  My son did for awhile, but he is right on track now.  I tried with the routine but it didn't start working until right before 3 months, and now that's still only a bedtime routine and a morning routine.  He will sleep when he is tired during the day...you can't try to keep a newborn up.  Just wait it out....it won't be like this for long.  Our "routine" for our 3 month old is 7:30 bath, then pajamas, story if he will tolerate it or a song, then feed and asleep by about 8:15.  He wake up at 8 and usually naps again around 10.  The rest of the day is on his own schedule.
QcGd8ktAaa	Babies can be exclusively nourished with breast milk through the first year.  Quit rushing with the baby food.|`|bgNB9RzNaa	if she looks like she cant swallow it i would stay with the stage 1 baby food for her safety|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	I asked my doctor this when my son was 5 months old and he said the stages are just a guide and it doesn't matter. I started giving him 2nd and 3rd right away. It all just depends on the baby.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	I started at 6 months, but it sounds like your daughter might not be ready yet. They do gag a little at first because they are going from something soupy to something a little more chunky and they are not used to that. Just make sure you are not force-feeding your daughter, and make sure she has swallowed completely before giving her the next spoonful. You might try mixing stage one and stage 2. Also, babies naturally throw up when something irritates their gag reflex- in this case this new "chunky" food. Keep trying just a few spoons at a time, she will get used to it. Also stage 2 takes longer to digest and fills a baby up faster so she may not need as much to make her feel full- try just a few spoons per meal, see how it goes!|`|giKCTfnfaa	i started my cousins baby this week on stage 2's.  he will be 6 months on the 25th of feb. we were told by the pediatrician to start when he started sitting up on his own, which he started doing a couple of weeks ago. the first time or two, he had a hard time eating it, but soon got used to the texture.  i also noticed the puddings need to be stirred before feeding.  if you feel uncomfortable giving her the stage 2's, then go back to the 1's for a couple more weeks and try the 2's again later.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Lie to her. Tell her you don't have a text plan anymore, and if you recieve texts now, it's very expensive. Or tell her you had to cancel your cell phone cause of financial strain or something, and then block her number or something. ??|`|MHTIe6hTaa	just tell her that you don't have unlimited texting and that you already went over so you can't text anymore or your bill will go up.   Thats all :)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	"texting gets expensive,please don't send anymore"|`|YrK7S8xtaa	change your number|`|2lByIoqGaa	just tell her you have a certain amount of texts/mins. and that you'd appreciate if she would stop sending the Fwds and maybe start texting real words when it's normal texts. That's nice enough lol. When my friends found out I had a limited texts they stopped texting me... anything! :( lol But if she doesn't get the hint just say it again but not sugar coated. Good luck! :)|`|3hwc11Ldaa	u could put her on the rejection list and or block her.|`|J4NgqZSIaa	just straight up tell her!!! "look i only get a certain amount of txts per month, so u cant b texting me stupid junk like forwards. and if u cant stop then i will have to change my number"|`|aDwfTXyDaa	i would say. sorry, i dont have texting anymore.|`|CNz9MF4naa	to stop the forwards, send a message saying:  "everyone: STOP sending me stupid forwards!!!"  but only send it to her. :)  to stop the other stuff (like night), stop texting back.  then send another "forward" saying  "everyone: i think some of you have been resending me messages by accident because i keep getting stupid texts at the wrong times, so PLZ not night or school calls!!?!  then for the her being annoying, just say "hey sry but my dad took away my texting and limited my calls so im rlly sry."    haha good luck. :)  besides, she'll get sick of you eventually.  just never answer or pick up, and she'll get it.|`|xNk9Jfakaa	I have gone through this...I just finally realized that the girl who I thought was my friend was not someone I needed to be friends with. She failed out of the first two colleges she attended, ended up with a couple of STDs, drinking, partying...etc. She was the type of girl who would text me constantly, call me, and get mad if I didn't answer. You have to ask yourself if your school work, family, and rules are more important than someone who has no regard for your values and cares. I completely ignored the girl who was constantly texting/calling me-- one of the best decisions I ever made. I was a junior in college and trying to deal with this. You need to take care of it now because she is not going to stop if you keep "feeding" her.|`|KwkEvmpPaa	i think you can block her number check you settings...what company and what type of phone do you have maybe i can help if you give that info|`|IwvOKjfcaa	You can say you changed your number, and give her a complete random number.  I do that sometimes haha.|`|TW4K4zLAaa	just say that you keep going over on texts and your mom blocked it.. and then dont respond to any of her texts.. maybe shell get the message.. or just say that you cant text her anymore..   good luck :D|`|p6uJwPjaaa	tell her she made it go off in class and that your parents took it and now you cant talk to her any more (but you will have to do it with your home phone other wise she will get suspicious)    or you could mail her ur fone/sim card   lol
zhJOZhKEaa	It will most likely come with a base.  However, you can see from the quote below that it can be used without it and it is *not* less safe to do so.  This quote is taken from a site run by car seat experts and discusses the plusses and minuses of installation with and without the base (capitals added for emphasis):    "In crash tests, PROPERLY USED SEATS TESTED SLIGHTLY BETTER WITHOUT A BASE. HOWEVER, this does not mean you should run out and buy a seat without a base. If you have a base, once it's installed, you're done. Simply latch the seat into the base every time and make sure it's latched in. If you don't, you will have to CORRECTLY install your car seat every time you want to go somewhere. While some car seat/vehicle combinations make this easy, most do not. You have to decide whether you really think you are going to be able to correctly install your seat every time. That includes all the times you're running late or just have to run to the store quickly. Even if you plan to leave your infant seat in the car all the time, a base may still be a better choice. A baseless seat installs with the seat belt over the top of the seat, so getting baby in if the seat is already buckled in can be difficult, meaning you will still have to re-install the seat for each ride."|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Most car seats come with a base and if you brought one without a base then yes because it's for your baby's safety.|`|giRRCXU4aa	They most generally come with a base because it is required to meet safety standards and is pretty much useless without.|`|xS0edNocaa	if you get the travel system, i know it comes with it.  not sure about when you buy it separately.|`|2qpBBTakaa	I believe so, yes.  When we bought ours it came with one.  You can buy extras so you don't have to move the base from car to car too.  We had a graco seat that was also a carrier.  You don't have to buy anything else....but....I HAD to have a mirror.  Before my daughter was born, I didn't think  I needed one, but it made me nuts not being able to see her (infants face backwards).|`|PymLdXM8aa	Um they all come with a base... you only have to buy a base if you need two. And yes you can have the baby in the car without the base. You can see how to properly install the seat with out the base. HOnestly i do not feel comfortable having to do that when i have to, but you just have to make sure that you read the instructions very carefully!       And no you do not have to buy anything else with it. Just make sure that you use the "clip" ( that will come with the seat )  that they supply you with for retractable seat belts. We had a jeep for the first 7 months of my daughters life and the middle seat in that was a lap belt. Then when we got our new car the had the shoulder belts in the middle and i didnt know about this clip until I was talking ot my cousin! Its a piece that helps to keep the seat belt locked. GL :)|`|UcpqJVJXaa	Most carseats sold are sold with the base included for added safety.  You can install the carseat without the base using the seatbelt, but I would not recommend doing so.|`|sKXm0utDaa	Most new car seats come with a base attached- so that you can leave the base hooked into the car and remove the car seat itself- helpful for newborns that sleep a lot! Even the car seats that come with a base can be belted into the car without the base.
d93dbb2143e07e022e1957b6ef08105caa	I'm not a guy but I wonder the same thing. I'm 24 or 25 weeks pregnant with twins, and we haven't had sex or anything intimate since I got pregnant in August.     Honestly, I feel so gross that I don't want to most of the time. But I don't get the impression that he finds me attractive, and that makes me feel even worse!! I envy those of you who maintain a loving, sexy relationship through pregnancy.     I really envy you. :-(|`|92acRvnYaa	Short answer............YES!!!!    The more curves the better!    I find pregnant women EXTREMELY SEXY! The breasts get fuller and everything....me likey.  Don't be self-conscious :)~|`|dlkLSlFjaa	I am 37 weeks pregnant and have'nt had sex since i was 25 weeks my partner doe'snt seem to care to much but you get a little self conscience.What makes it worse is ,its my first and the thought of a human growing inside me freaks him out and he won't even touch my belly at all..but when that 6-8 weeks is up after bub is out i hope its back to normal... i like your question i hope lots of guys answer.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	My husband loves my new body. The belly is getting pretty big. He can't wait for that to go down. Lol.  But with my breasts and all. Very nice. Just the thought of you carrying his child. All men love.  I thought the same thing tho, I mean? I love my prego body. But i feel like a whale at times.      Honey, give him all you got now, cause when that baby comes. You gotta wait 6-8weeks to heal, plus you might not have the time with a baby around!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I'm not a guy but my husband loved my pregnant body. Pregnancy is such a beautiful thing to begin with. I'm not one of the slim ladies and i had a little bit of junk in the trunk before i got preggers but he thought I was absolutely beautiful. Believe me mommy-to-be you husband thinks you are gorgeous!|`|2N4j1ficaa	my hubby fond me very sexy when pregnant and sex was great  no chance i was going to get pregnant and  sex is much nicer  as all your sexy bit are being pushed down and you can climax so easy .. and lots ... how can that be bad .. you will look gorges to him hun he loves you and you are carrying his child how can you not look sexy|`|iohG0qt8aa	it's just sexy|`|XqkqCPYVaa	Ya she turns me on alot lol|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	My husband told me that I was very attractive to him during pregnancy because it was sexy to him knowing that I was carrying his son.
93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i was 19 when i had my son and abortion never crossed my mind- never ever thought about even if i got pregnant before then. probably because i come from a family of 7 and i am the middle child. i was my mother's 4th kid and she was 21, i'm glad neighter she or my father believed in abortion|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Good for you, your family and community taught you to be a decent human being. It's a sad state of affairs, really. So many people are just really careless and unwilling to take any responsibility for their actions whatsoever.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I completely agree. They wanna do the crime, but not the time. It seems that abortion has just become birth control for a lot of girls.|`|AA11763588	Why do you care? They aren't your children, nor is it your body. I'm sure the child having sex didn't want to get pregnant.     Everyone makes mistakes in life... no one is perfect. I'm sure you've done some things you are not proud of.|`|mhSjwuntaa	because sex is fun....and its cool and everyone else is doing it so why not??? but then they get preggers and freak out and have to kill it.    Why does it seem like its so easy for teens to get pregnant and there are women (including myself) trying so hard to get pregnant and find that it's taking longer than I thought it would.|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	because abortions are legal.    and even if they wernt its still an option    you arnt the moral authority no one truely is. thats why its a choice.    i feel the right thing to do is w,e is best for the little thing    if the life itd lead would be terrible not just for the parents but for it then i dont have a problem with ending it before it begins    i actually really dont see a problem with it. its not a life. if i got a chick pregnant id have it killed|`|YrK7S8xtaa	because they are not will to take the consequences for there action|`|KA5nhL1uaa	Because no one has ever told them otherwise and it's become so socially accepted in society, they are lead to believe that it's okay. i completely agree with you, if they're not ready to take on the responsibility of raising a child, they shouldn't be having intercourse. abortion isn't the solution.|`|otFCWMuUaa	im 19 and i ALSO am do disgusted at it..    it makes me sick! i could not think of killing something that i created simply out of fear.. people keep makin excuses for them when really they should be kickin their a*s*s*..    im pregnant now and its freakin hard.. theres alotta stuff im scared to death of but i took the risk and now this is what i have in my hands n im gonna be responsible and take care of the child i created...    i think most teens are off gettin abortions because their afraid of their parents. grow up.. i come from a very religious,close minded set of parents n i had the guts to tell mine.. you wanna be respected as an adult start acting like one.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	I am 19 now, but had my daughter when I was 17.And abortion never crossed my mind, nor did it cross her fathers. We are now getting married,and he loves his daughter more than anything. I do agree though people need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions. If they are responsible enough to have sex then they can make an adult desicion that doesnt envolve just "getting rid" of the problem.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I've not met many teens that deliberatly set out to get pregnant. Usually it was an "accident" or rape. Or they say they used protection but in reality didn't. Not all teens are like this though. I've seen some teens straighten up after discovering they are pregnant. I've seen some teen fathers help the baby and mom.     Sometimes the teen may feel like they have to do abortion or adoption, depending on their situration.    I'm 18 and pregnant with my 1st baby. Not once did abortion or even adoption cross my mind. I love my baby and can never imagine ending the pregnancy or giving my baby up for adoption, when both her father and mother love her as well as her aunts and grandparents!    I'm 19 next month but I'm still a young parent.|`|TzLxCXm9aa	I absolutly agree with you and by the way its not just teens, ive meet woman who've had 8 or 9 abortions and think its ok to use it as birth control i have seen and talked to so many abortion nurses and these kids have no idea how real that baby is or how it does feel the pain. they should all be shown an ultra sound of there baby before the abortion bet it would change alot of minds...and i believe this "plan b" is killin a baby to just doin it alil sooner. come on the president closed gontonamo bay and gave money towards abortion so basicly its not right to torture terrorist but its ok to kill babys|`|UOfitYbmaa	they have no morals or values and are concerned about themselves that's about it!!|`|dShnJ20raa	My boyfriend and I were ttc before I got really sick. I am now on a bunch of different medications both for pain and to make me better. We stopped trying but if I got pregnant now while I am on so many meds I think I would really have to consider abortion because it's really not fair for me to endanger a child like that before he or she is even born. I think it has a lot to do with the circumstances. I want a baby but it wouldn't be fair to bring one in knowing that there could be possible side effects from something I have no real control over.|`|Q87xLOkdaa	Let's get this straight -- no one thinks it's okay, they just have no other choice. And honestly, would you rather have a bunch of poor, inexperienced teenaged mothers raising children poorly, or have people choose to NOT have them? Don't be such a jerk.|`|IQg3xIKAaa	Society these days is making it okay. In my opinion abortion is a great thing for people who need it, but these days it just gets taken advantage of.|`|24P6A0oaaa	I think a majority of girls and boys that age don't realize exactlly what a big deal pregnancy and abortion, when I was that age I never really "understood" everything|`|FufV5aZNaa	Because parents throw such a hissy fit about someone else teaching their kids the facts of life most sex ed classes have been dissolved.    But this is an akward subject and many people leave it up to the teen to figure out themselves through friends, the internet and porn. Most times this information is flawed at best or just down right untrue.    Like girls can't get pg if they're on top because of gravity. Ring a bell?    But...even though they don't want to talk about sex they're ready to threaten, punish, and shame kids that get in trouble from the lack of information.    I don't like abortion but it's a choice. I would rather the couple in question have an abortion before that child is hurt by the life it's thrown into with unexperience or unwilling parents or be tossed away with the garbage.    I'm not totally blaming parents but I do think society has let our youth down on this. It's a double edged sword. We're not going to educate you but you damn well better know better than to do this.|`|J4NgqZSIaa	ive seen this many times too. i was pregnant at 16 and had an abortion. i wouldnt go back and change nething!!! i knew it wuz the right decision. it had nothing to do with my age tho. i am 21 now and pregnant with a baby girl (planned). but girls who knowingly have unprotected sex and get pregnant and have abortions are stupid. i think abortion is okay only under certain circumstances. hate me if you want!!!|`|WbyNpR5iaa	Because our education system is obsolete and we are literally raising a nation of idiots.    I share in your frustration|`|n8Z4ijr8aa	Many teens that have sex do so in a spur the moment location and time, many people will wake up and realise what they have done and regret it in the long run. They don't want an evening hookup to result in something that is going to affect them for the rest of their lives and that is why many teens look to abortion as a quick fix. Sadly it's something that people are going to have to accept. It's their right to have it, and sadly its going to stay that way for a time to come. I do agree that they should think about the result before they go and do things like that but thats just the way it is.|`|QF9ohbM8aa	Cause they so damn stupid  Abortions are so wrong in so many ways you cant even imagine|`|ki5hZbcTaa	this is why kids should not have sex. OR better yet, their parents need to stop being naive and teach them about contraception. This abstinence **** that schools teach is ridiculous. Kids have NO IDEA how to protect themselves. That's why we see such stupid questions on here about can I get pregnant by doing A, B, or C.|`|PymLdXM8aa	I got pregnant at 19 and that thought never once came into my mind. Yeah i was all into partying and all that but from the minute I found out I was pregnant my maternal instincts just completely took over.... honestly it si because none you the people you age have any common sense and all all to immature to see the bigger picture.    EDIT: Sorry i didnt mean to say none of these teens.... i meant most Its good though you can think for sure self and make up your own mind!  Good for you!
jNgh3e3Faa	Not a good idea.   It makes you or baby sick.      There are practitioners who do not recommend castor oil because of potential side effects like dehydration (from loose stools and/or vomiting), fetal distress and meconium in the baby. Though castor oil inductions take place without the knowledge of the practitioner in some cases, it is always wise to talk to your midwife or doctor about how to use castor oil before doing so.|`|giRRCXU4aa	It's dangerous. Does nothing really. It can cause the baby to have a BM in utero. Meconium in amniotic fluid is a big problem, it can cause respiratory problems with your baby and sometimes worse. Don't risk your baby's life because of your discomfort. The baby will come when it's ready.|`|5f6XnInEaa	The possibility of taking a tonic that would give me severe diarrhea for the rest of the week, not to mention put my son at risk most certainly did NOT cross my mind, nor should it be crossing yours.    You say "speed things up" which hints that you aren't at your due date yet.    Be patient, baby will come when it wants too, not when it's handy.|`|MqFeJiukaa	I tried it and it not only didn't work but made me super sick.  Baby will come when baby is ready.|`|gyoylefvaa	No, you need to have a lot sex or eat spice or eggplant.|`|DKfScL8taa	DON'T DO IT        DON'T DO IT       DON 'T DO IT. You will be vomitting, and crapping all over the place, in pain, and you won't go into labor.|`|FufV5aZNaa	Please research this a little more. It can be dangerous because it can cause such severe cramping and actually hurt mom or baby. Please reconsider.    Fresh pineapple, red raspberry leaf tea, and primrose oil are all much gentler safter natural methods.|`|OoaZGumxaa	Didn't try that but I mall walked for about 5 hours and went into labor the next day. I swear by it! ( I had her a day earlier than due date)|`|rVsW4ESTaa	Don't do anything to speed this up.  That is crazy.  You could hurt your baby.  If you need to, talk to your doctor and they can induce you.    Hang in there.  Enjoy the moment.|`|G4qP2gATaa	You probably shouldn't try castor oil as it can give you diarrhea and you can start vomiting.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	First of all don't do this- it is dangerous- I can't remember why but I remember reading it somewhere when I was pregnant with my first son. What worked for me- eat cooked cabbage- breastfeeding babies don't like the taste of it so I decided that maybe babies in utero wouldn't either! It worked. I ate in at night before bed- like a lot of it- like probably half of a small head of cabbage boiled in water, and then I put butter and salt on it after, to kill the taste a little. I went into labor the next morning. I delivered 10 days early. Don't do this unless you are atleast within a week or two of your due date. I also walked a lot- a long trip around the mall every day! Some things that didn't work--> shots of hotsauce (just gross), sex (just really goofy and uncomfortable at 9 months) Try the cabbage! Good luck!|`|TzLxCXm9aa	hey i have done this but you need to drink like 2whole bottles of it and let me tell ya it is the WORST stuff you'll ever have in your mouth it is like drinkin liquid vasaline im not kiddin...be at home cause it will give you diahra like you'll run every 30sconds and itll last for hrs but all the bowl movements start the contracting big time...i guarantee you will go in labor but if your not ready then itll stop in like 5hrs. but if like me and your far enough along if you go to hosp with the contractions they jusst keep you and let you have it|`|NvaiomHVaa	castor oil didn't work for me.. orgasm did, though.. here is a really good article on the ways to induce labor that actually work..    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    good luck and congratulations|`|44OH7Si6aa	If you think you are in pain now, just wait until you take that castor oil. Most likely you will be up all night on the toilet with severe diarrhea cramps and it will do nothing else. Spicy foods, pineapples, Walking, sex, nipple stimulation|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Lol! I'm sitting here, 39 weeks and dying too, thinking about castor oil! I called my dad who was an RN and he said, it COULD help labor, or leave you on the toilet for the next couple of days, STILL pregnant. Guess it's up to you if you wanna try it, I'm pretty nervous cause it's probably just not time. I'm thinking I'm either in early or false labor ATM, but nothing severe enough to go in just yet. I feel your pain!
kaqPSgTVaa	Most doctors don't test your HCG levels after the first appointment if there is nothing wrong with your pregnancy. They only test for your levels if they see something alarming in your ultrasounds or you have symptoms of miscarriage. I never got tested for my levels in my first pregnancy. My sister only did because they weren't detecting heartbeat. You don't need to know your levels cause you have a healthy normal pregnancy.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Apparently it was always in a normal range.. If there was nothing to worry about,why mention it,unless you ask.|`|AA11763588	Mine only tells me if I had blood work and I ask.    It's not really something you have to "know" or be worried about.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	no if it is normal there is no need for him to mention it to you|`|giRRCXU4aa	My doctor never said anything about mine either. My doctor's philosophy is "No news is good news." So, it's not a bad thing. Good Luck!|`|5p0AW33jaa	i don't think its strange... my doctor never mentioned about those HCG's either. so don't you worry dear. good luck to you and tc|`|7iylPJUraa	No, my friends doctor never told her. If you're afraid of anything being wrong, I wouldn't worry about it. He would tell you if it wasn't normal. If you want to know, just ask. No harm in that! :) Congrats!|`|gBEq0zo5aa	They would only mention it if it was abnormal. High levels could mean you are having problems or expectiong twins. Low levels would also be a cause for concern. There is a large range of normal- if you fall into that range, you are fine. Also, you are far along enough that HCG levels don't matter anymore- they only matter when the placenta is being made, and your baby has a placenta by now!|`|WbyNpR5iaa	they usually only talk about it if there is something to worry about.  If those levels begin to drop then he/she will tell u more about them    hCG levels drop in women before they miscarry.|`|aCePLit5aa	Hcg is what is detected in either your urine or blood, which confirms if you are pregnent. It's not important to know the levels as you are either positive or negative with baby.|`|MOSe9JYaaa	HCG levels vary so much between each pregnancy.  The level itself doesn't matter unless it stops rising and that is an indicator of miscarriage.  If the pregnancy is healthy and moving a long well there is no reason to discuss HCG levels past the point that they detect it and tell you that you are pregnant.
5EiShLZZaa	Pelvic tilts will help give support to your lower abdomen...lay on your back and just rock your pelvis up flattening your back on the floor, hold 5 seconds and repeat.  I met with a physical therapist my last pregnancy and this was one of the recommendations.  Also, get an exercise ball, sit on it and simply move your hips( side to side, circles, back and forth), this will tighten and strengthen your abs, sides, and lower back.  As long as your heart rate doesn't exceed 140, cardio is fine, and you should take in an extra 200 calories for every hour of exercise, as well as tons of fluids.  Just start slowly and build up your indurace and take breaks when you need to.  Good luck!|`|fPX1lD8uaa	If your getting lower abdomen pain, I think you should talk to your doctor about what exercising he/she would recommend for you if at all.    Good luck!|`|OWReYgV5aa	What you are doing for cardio sounds good..don't over do it...just don't get so out of breath that you cannot carry on a conversation.    As for the back pain and pelvic discomfort, stand against a wall and do pelvic lifts, where you press the small ofyour back into the wall, do about 10 and work your way up.  Also, get on your hands and knees and arch your back up like a cat stretch, then back down...then back up and back down.  Do 10 of those to start out with and work your way up...you can do these everyday.|`|wBpennsMaa	Walk for a mile on a treadmill every day.
yt1OcnQ1aa	I'm in the same situation. I have an annoying friend, too. I think you should get a restraining order. I'm thinking of one, as well.|`|MrNkNnhyaa	instead of telling him over and over again,just ignore him,he'll get the message.  :]
3CG3rby0aa	Depends on the hospital and the doctor.  some will let him in and some won't. Just talk to the doctor and see what they say.  Hopefully he gets better before the baby is born.  good luck and get well!|`|v3LnJycKaa	not in the hospital I go to... unfortunately they will not allow him in the ward, as there are other mother and newborns and although you may not be concerned they have to keep them in mind... now if he doesnt have a runny nose, cough, or vomitting (no visible sick signs) then he may be able to take tylenol/ibuprofin to bring his temp down, and get away with it... but unless you are going today you should be fine, most fevers are 24-48 hours before they break.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, he can. If the doctor is concerned about him spreading something contagious, he can wear a mask.
DKfScL8taa	Do you have a dave n busters? It isn't what you think it will be. Go there have a good dinner and some drinks, you guys will have so much fun together, he will enjoy the fact that you did something he would like, and you'll like it too. I went there for my anniversary, way better than a  typical romantic date.|`|2qpBBTakaa	I would NOT try and go out on Valentine's Day proper unless you go early.  I would have a nice dinner and then go home and cuddle or take a bubble bath together.  Something where you can relax and be together.
yuGhmhGuaa	Go to the YMCA, or the red cross|`|rqvbqdPpaa	You can advertise for this i.e. local paper or flyers at the grocery store. Or you can operate a licensed day care from your home. Look it up on line. Licensing isn't that hard. If you already have kids you probably already have the proper security measures.
K5TrkUhCaa	I honestly love everything about my husband! He is very supportive to me and a wonderful father to our children. I feel very blessed to be with him. Our story is way too long for me to type on here, but we had to go through a lot just so that we could be together and I believe that because of how hard we fought to be together that our relationship is extremely strong. He does work a lot and I rarely see him (he's in the medical field and I am a SAHM) but whenever we do get a chance to be together it's always great for us because we are just happy to have eachother. I can honestly say that we do not argue or fight either. I know that most people will think or say 'that can't be true, every couple fights' but I'm being completely honest and we really do not fight over anything ever. Our relationship is kind of hard to explain but I do feel very blessed by it and I could not imagine my life without my sweet husband.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	There isn't anything I don't love about him  He is really sweet, and loving. Drop dead handsome to.  He is a loving step dad to my daughter. He spends loads of time with her, and is very attentive to her needs. He reacts really well, when I have to go to meet my ex, to discuss my daughter. (we have dinner every few weeks to talk about things going on in her life) and he is very understanding.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I love that he lives in another state never contacts us and sends me lots of money|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Me and my husband went through soooo much to be together, and I am so glad we did because he is awesome. He works two jobs just so me and his baby can have a good life and he never complains.
7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	My mom told me one about when she was pregnant with me, she said she smoked pot.  But the good thing is whenever I cant spell a word, or whenever I do something wrong, I always go " Well I wouldn't have done that if you didn't smoke pot when you were pregnant with me" and she always goes..." You may be right so I cant get mad " lol    So it all worked out I guess...lucky but I am relatively normal.     Except for my 3rd eye I have in the middle of my back....comes in handy sometimes though.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	oh gosh.. lol.. i did get my flu shot!! BUT....    i love raw hotdogs and i crave them and bologna. so i eat them at least every other day. i love to dip pretzels in brownie batter. i've eaten steaks medium rare and even raw. my son hits my belly and i'm not worried about it. i wanted a girl and was honestly a little disappointed when i found out i was getting another boy.     and my biggest pregnancy confession.. i hate being pregnant. i hate everything about it. well, not everything.. food does taste a lot better. but yes, i hate being pregnant. but i love my son and i love the son i'm carrying and i can't wait to have at least 2 more!  And another one. My husband is in IRAQ and i'm constantly crying and worrying over him.. doing it to the point where i have some serious contractions and get worried on a weekly basis about preterm labor.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Candy! I was terrible with candy!  I had lunch meat too!   I drank pop, caffeine free though!    My son is 8 months old and healthy, but he did weigh 10'11 at birth, which I think was from the candy!|`|TepAZAHyaa	I'm not pregnant can't get pregnant but congrats to you.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I didn't get the flu shot either. My Dr. wanted me too, but I work from home so I don't feel I'm as exposed to flu germs as most people. I started eating lunch meat last week. I needed something. Since I've been pregnant I haven't wanted anything to eat at all so I needed something different. I also didn't realize until recently that I'm not supposed to have mayonnaise and I had no idea. I also have a hard time stomaching my prenatal vitamins so I haven't been taking them every day. I started out taking them all the time and never missed one, but for the last couple of weeks I've been really bad with them.|`|9c2382dc21c9e3bda7ce8d972c920a34aa	I drink a Mocha Latte almost everyday. I know, I know...it's horrible.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I sleep on my back when I'm pregnant as long as I'm comfortable.    I quit smoking years back and have been wanting a cigarette sooo bad now for the past few weeks. I would never start smoking again but I feel so bad for even WANTING one right now. :(|`|qCQ5z8ISaa	I told my husband and mom that I would eat healthy kinda like be on a diet because I couldn't gain anymore weight to fit my weddign dress and well the baby and I wanted Jerry's pizza and mcdonalds....I felt horrible lying but the dress fit and we were all happy! LOL|`|AR683Nz6aa	i eat some raw cookie dough in ben and jerrys ice cream! i can not say no to it....... i had two glasses of wine on my birthday while i was on holiday. just poke my stomach alot to make him move, nothing major but i think its the only thing i would do lol|`|hy9fz99Xaa	I've used it to get out of cleaning on several occasions   but here's the big one  I sent the babydaddy out to taco bell at 2am for me  I'm mean ;)|`|aEmdURPTaa	What's wrong with raw cookie dough?  It's not like it's raw meat...  What am I missing?    Anyway, my confession is that ate oysters twice during the fourth month.  I had terrible food aversions, and incredible oyster craving.  I went to the restaurant for my birthday, and then for my mother's birthday.  And both times, somebody around me ordered them... and I just couldn't resist having one each time!!!  That's sooo bad !  :-(    As for those who feel bad for having one coffee a day, aren't we allowed something like 4 a day during pregnancy?  I never had more than one a day when I could stand the smell, but I never felt guilty about it, as I read in several books that it was ok to do so.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I didn't get the flu shot with either of my pregnancies and I eat what I want with in reason...I stress about the weight I am gaining even though I am supposed to gain weight...I feel like a cow today and everyone still says I look cute!!   I am majorly stressed and am looking forward to that gallon margarita I am earning right now!!!!!!! LOL! can you tell I am having a bad day!?|`|ykP7I3caaa	I have really bad junk food days.

Oh wait one more haha...l ate my steak rare a few weeks ago|`|a3MSSvdcaa	The other night at a superbowl party, I had a sip of my boyfriends beer...just a sip though (I know they say one beer is safe but it still makes me feel guilty)    Also I drank 4 cans of pepsi that night.  Water gets old!  And we were out late so I needed to stay awake!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Didn't you put this question up a few days ago?  What is the root problem you are trying to uncover?|`|zwaCsOeVaa	I'm not pregnant.    Enjoy your baby.|`|buoqtZeFaa	My confession would have to be that even though i try I don't eat healthy at all.  i know I am going to have to work like heck to get back down to the size I was after.    I am 27 weeks also and I had my 3D/4D ultrasound on Saturday.  Isn't it the greatest but creepiest thing lol.  I could see the little face so good and I swear one picture we got look just like my boyfriend.  It was great
0nb1rQhnaa	I guess I suggest not buying everything you think need ahead of time. I stocked up on baby bunting wraps, crib lights, a weird baby pillow thing, a bouncy seat (expensive!), and way too many rattles and toys, that my son never even touched. I could have saved a few hundred dollars if I hadn't bought all that to begin with. Just think of the absolute essentials and stick with those.|`|orIAir11aa	Consignment (or resale) shops! When my son was 3 months old, I went to a consignment sale and bought 3 month to 12 month clothes for him - enough for the rest of the year - for $106! Included in the $106 were also a Boppy pillow, Johnny Jumper, and 10 Dr. Brown's bottles. Some of the clothes were gently used, and others were still new with tags! The consignment sale here is bi-annually. It's definitely something to look into. HTH!|`|UghJ0XROaa	Did you have a baby shower yet? For triplets, i think you need one! Then you can weed out what you need to buy. Try outlet stores to get bargains.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	For clothes for the first few months, go to dollar stores and wal-mart. The quality isn't that good, but they will grow out of it so fast, and it will probably still be in good enough shape to pass onto other people after you're finished with it. Children's Place also has some nicely priced, cute, quality clothes. For the furniture check out store websites and see where you can get the best deal. Also, try talking to the manager, explain your situation and they may cut you a deal because you're buying so much furniture. A friend of mine had twins and got a 25% discount at Babies R Us.|`|955YoHvVaa	Don't buy namebrand and expensive clothing-I have bought dresses and stuff for my daughter at high end kid clothing stores and they had just the same at walmart..and girls can wear blue stuff-my sister had a son and gave me all his old sleepers for my daughter and I didn't care the least. You say moneys not a problem and don't want second hand stuff, then why ask how to get it cheaply?|`|vOgfAvMlaa	If you still have your son's crib you can use that. they say that when they are so young babies want to be close to each other and it helps them sleep better so for a few months you could get by with only one crib. and in that time save up money and shop around for 2 more cribs. you will be able to reuse some of the clothing that you had for your son too. most onsies and sleepers are pretty much unisex anyway and if they are at home no one is going to mistake them for boys. you probably have enough blankets and again they are unisex. the only other thing i can think of is talk to friend and family members and see if they know anyone who would be willing to sell or even give you their baby stuff.|`|QivKZLcUaa	PRIMARK! a get my nephew and neices clothes from the all the time . there very cheap|`|G2auAv1Saa	Well if you don't want to buy second hand then I really can't help you.     Buying second hand is the bargain hunting for newborns, how long did your son use his things and in hindsight was all the money you spent worth it?|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If money is an issue I would put aside the whole "can't use it because it's for a boy thing."  Honestly, who cares if the girls have some blue clothes?  I wear blue clothes all the time.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Try 2nd hand stores and garage sales for clothing.  If you know anyone who has had a baby somewhat recently, you could see if they'd be willing to sell you the old equipment such as car seats, highchairs, or cribs.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	try places like Freecycle and, I think, it's called Craigs List? Check ebay for bargains on big piles of clothes and hunt charity shops. The sooner you start, the better! Also, if people ask if you need anything for the babies, make sure you have a list of things you need and mention something off the list-that can be useful for things like baby blankets, baby monitor, bottles, steriliser, etc.     And good luck with your little ones!    EDIT: You mention you don't want second hand things. That case, it may be a lot harder to bargain hunt!!|`|1Si9RlEXaa	Well if you don't want second hand then your really can't save all that much but a few dollars during sell. I would try craigslist, they have a ton of stuff on there. We have gotten some really nice things for my baby at a fraction of retail price. You can also try E-bay. But with shipping fees I don't think you save all that much.     Other than that just wait for the sells at stores. I got lucky and their was a Babies R us shutting down so I got some really nice things for really cheap.
dzyJw0cvaa	Why would u want to be blond?  Dark hair is so much prettier and i love the shade your hair currently is.      But yes, i think you could pass off being a blond, i just think u should leave it the way it is.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	maybe but if you do lighten your eyebrows.|`|ejJD6BBXaa	no u look alot better as a brunette trust me|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	If you dye your hair, you will need to change your hair style because, blond won't work with your present hair style.|`|8NFLpbJAaa	Yes I think you could pull it off,  I would say  natural like honey blonde ?|`|iZDsMCghaa	If you go to the limetime tv website theres a "game" where you can upload your own pic and try out hair colors and styles. Its not that great to be honest but its helpful.    IMO, I look at you and think you should stay the way you are, it suits you but if you do go blonde, Id go with a dark golden blonde, not platinum and remember to lighten your eyebrows at least to medium brown.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	to be honest, i think you wouldn't as your complexion is too coloured. A light brown with blonde highlights would.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|VkvhtD4daa	yeh you are pretty|`|8Jwe8ODOaa	yea! I think you'd look adorable. I think strawberry blonde would look cute on you, the red already looks good on ya. Good luck!|`|eCAYTSpXaa	Your beautiful just the way you are. I don't really think you need to dye your hair any color. I love the brown/auburn color it is.     If you've got your heart set on dying it.. why not try highlighting first? It'll give you a feel on if you think you would look good with blond. May I suggest a honey color?    Heather|`|tudie6lvaa	I thought I would like having blond hair, and my hair color was kinda like yours. I got highlights to see if i would like it, and I did, then I just went all the way and colored it blond, BIG MISTAKE. It has been two years and my hair is still recovering from it, it looked good for a little bit, but in the long run it wasn't worth it, your roots start to grow out, and the blond coloring damages your hair. You look fine, if you want just get some highlights, don't ruin your hair.|`|n9YrbkUcaa	I think it would look really good!  I would only do it, though, if you could maintain the color without letting the roots show, so it doesn't look trashy.  A really soft, light blond would look best, in my opinion.|`|JWeGxTjZaa	Yes, and it's true - we do have more fun.|`|TRM8tJ7laa	Yes I love Blonde hair!!! I think everyone should have blonde hair. haha|`|1b9p0126aa	probably yeah.. but u shouldn't!  u have nice hair! i wouldn't change it ^.^|`|aa596673c4a4b7827a51695b15eb9ae8aa	I'd start by highlighting your hair to see if you like it.  But I do think you'd look good as a blond.  May be platinum blond  to highlight with and then if you like it you could keep it or go darker.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I am sorry, but your hair colour is fine the way it is and I personally think that you wouldn't look good as a blonde. Sorry :(
3MztcAh9aa	Yes, my niece thinks she has superpowers.  She tells me she is catwoman and wonder woman.  She also thinks she is superman.|`|SGreWjXaaa	Haha! Oh my God, i've haven't noticed till now!    Good observation.|`|sZzb3Iywaa	but i DO have them i swear i can, i jus don't want to show you.|`|Oextrh4iaa	Yes they do. Its television shows that make them believe they have these hidden powers.|`|qVt6wJqMaa	Aw!  I hadn't noticed until just now!  It's so cute how they one-up each other...!  |`|PinISaoSaa	Well of course they do, many kids idolize people with superpowers solely based on they fact that they can do what the child can not. In order to feel special the child will then make believe that they too can too can do the unthinkable and do what others can not.|`|scBqngJ1aa	Lmao so much! also I remember when I was little jumping off the coach with a blanket as a cape saying "I can fly!!"|`|1hciyvKdaa	My son did, especially in his batman jammies! Its cute.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	oooh yeeeah!  one time, i called my then 5-year old son to lunch with a, "hey, spiderman!  time for lunch!"    and he ran to me, completely panicked, and mumbled in my ear, "quiet, mom!  i'm peter parker right now!"  lol!!!!!!|`|yNMc5g7paa	They may not claim it, but they think it!|`|3AAtPzSaaa	not really....... unless theyre pretending to be batman or somthing and all dressed up|`|rVnTnuU1aa	After taking the kids to see Kung Fu Panda, my daughters new super power was cat scratch, my sons was dog scratch and husbands was bear scratch.

It's all imagination and they have great ones ,too. It's all harmless and is so cute to watch.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	It is a wonderful thing to watch a child's imagination go wild and they are being whatever they want to be. Only if I could be young again and to only have half the imagination they do one can only dream of such peace. I think it is awesome and I only hope my son will have a imagination to help him dream up anything he wants.|`|AA11717874	that is part of today's culture. Spider-man, Superman. The ancients had Hercules, Achilles. its a human trait to want to be "bigger than". Kids do it as a game, adults do it to be famous, powerful.|`|eDVzT3I8aa	We all have superpowers, but when we grow up we forget that we can fly, and run like the wind, and lift cars; we take on responsibilities and we no longer have time to shoot lazers from our fingertips, we no longer have the ability to climb vertical walls with nothing for support but our own imagination.  It sucks to get old, I want my superpowers back!!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I am sorry, but our second Eldest William, he really does have super powers.    Just because he can't leap tall building in a single bound, or fight bad guys, or even fly, doesn't mean he doesn't have super powers.  His super power is the ability to hear, given to him in a small yet powerful, hearing aid. With that hearing aid, his future is brighter.    He doesn't claim to have super powers, he really does have them|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	i used to think if i couldn't see you u couldn't see me i was invisile by brother used to think he could fly
kowvnRhXaa	potty training time!!!  my daughter was 19months when we started... just do it, and stick to it... i spent a few days at home with my daughter... left her naked, and took her to the bathroom every 30 minutes... then a few days of that, then 45 minutes... and so on.  if you really stick to it, he will get it.  it might take a few months to be completely accident free, but it pays off in the end!!! (o:|`|weA0Xdszaa	Well you could try the potty again, just in case. If it doesn't, well, too bad. He's just not ready. And yup, a toy might help while you change him ... or hanging something from the ceiling for him to look at, like a mobile...?  Good luck|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Welcome to the "Terrible Two's".  ;)    I have a 2 year old who isn't too fond of stopping what he's doing to have his diaper changed.  But diaper changes aren't negotiable.  It's possible that your son is becoming ready for toilet training, but I'm more apt to think he is fighting you just because he can.  lol  Kids this age are becoming aware of their ability to make choices, and love to assert their independence (and push Mommy's buttons).    When you have to do a diaper change, try distracting him with a toy, small snack, tv program, etc.  My son is more likely to lie still for a diaper change when there's something else to hold his interest.|`|NfKxRUo7aa	then dont use dipers|`|UfELDZoMaa	He's near that Terrible 2 mark. this is just the fun of having a 2 year old.     They Deny Everything. They are finding out what they can get away with and using it to their advantage.     YOu will have to be firm and carry him to the changing table or bed and change his diaper whether he likes it or not and firmly tell him he has no choice.     They Manipulate and if you give in, they will run the household|`|KV590Y6Saa	So,let him run around naked, fill him up on junk food and sugary drinks (makes him pee and poo more) and let him sit backwards on the big potty.  What's it gonna hurt?  Be strong and don't go back, get him pull ups for bedtime.  Have him take his diapers and throw them in the trash and tell him that he's a big boy now!!!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	he could be. my son uses the potty some and he's about to be 22 months- he hates being in a wet or dirty diaper though and if he poops in his diaper he wants me to change it right away and lays down where ever it happens to change hom|`|sw2R5A9iaa	yea!! this is the first step in potty training.  continue to encourage your child, put a step stool in the bathroom so he can reach the toilet & sink, allow him to run around without a diaper for a few hours each day (this is very healthy for the skin), and remember that it will take up to 5 yrs for his body to fully mature and develop bowel/bladder habits.|`|xS0edNocaa	i know it may be weird to some people, but maybe he's scared and if he sees you go on the potty then he wont be scared and will want to try.  its never to early. or try giving him a toy while you change him.  good luck

c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	An ear infection could give her diarrhea, which will in turn give her a rash...keep her clean and dry if possible...and get her to the Dr....|`|n6XYYyoLaa	diarrhea, diaper rash, and real frequent poops, with an indication that her ear hurts...ummm...doc appt? now..:?|`|bZWbwyn4aa	My daughter used to get really bad rash, as she had extremely sensitive skin, and just the slightest acid in her poop was enough to set it off and it would end up weeping and raw for several days.    First thing is cut out any fruit, juice or acidic foods from her diet for the time being - these things will make it worse and also make it hurt more.    Do not bath her with soap.  I used a product called QV oil, but it is a New Zealand product, so not sure if you have it there, but I'm sure there are similar products for sensitive skins to put in a bath.  Soap is an irritant so anything containing soap should be ruled out.      While her rash is bad, you should check her frequently for change of diaper.  6 may not be enough for now - I know its a pain, but when my daughters was bad, I would check every 1/2 hour.  ALso, leave her without diapers a few times a day.  I know it may mean a bit of a mess, but find a room in your house that it is easy to clean and mop and do some activities in that room diaper free.    Now for the creams.  You should be using a zinc and castor oil based cream, and a zinc powder.  We would put a layer of powder first (it helps the cream stay on) then a layer of the zinc/castor oil cream, and then another layer of powder.  The castor oil helps protect the rash from further dampness, much better than just a zinc based product.      If you have tried most of this and nothing is working, see your doctor, there are anti-bacterial creams and steroid creams that work (have had to use them before).  Smetimes when it goes on for a long time, it can get infected, and you really need the extra help.    Please be assured, this is not your fault, and it is not necessarily about feeding your child the wrong things or not changing them enough.  Some kids just have really sensitive skin - my daughter was at her worst when she was teething (pee and poop becomes more acidic).    Good luck!|`|RSEp960aaa	does she have a fever? it might be some kind of intestinal flu. Get some aquaphor or vaseline and mix it with Mylanta (a liquid antacid) smear this on her bum and it will reduce the sting. See if you can let her go without a diaper for a while, een if you have to put her on top of a garbage bag for something. The bum needs to dry off!  You might also want to give her some children's motrin|`|K1UicE7kaa	With the likely ear infection and a rash that severe... she should be seen by the health care provider.   There are two usual types of diaper rashes or a combination of the two... and they are treated differently.   The doctor will have to look at it to figure that out. But staying clean and dry is important.    Chronic ear infections have to be addressed or you can have sequelae. The diarrhea can also progress and she could really get sick and minimally will be totally miserable with everything else happening.  I think you have no choice but to call for an appointment first thing in the morning... monitor for a high temp... If that occurs I probably would take her to a pediatric hospital ER given all the other symptoms. If that happens... take records along of what antibiotics she was recently on for her ear infections (that would be useful to know).    You can't blindly treat rashes without knowing what the etiology is... or you can make it really bad... that is why an experienced pediatrician is wise.  There are many things you can do prevenitively once the rash is gone.  Acidic fluids do not change the pH of urine significantly (myth).  I would never use corn meal on a raw skin whatsoever... (Nice way to feed a yeast type rash and it is too abrasive for red-raw skin.)  You can cause more problems with some of the over the counter topicals if the skin is raw too.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	Use plain corn starch (or Destin Corn Starch) in her diaper and Castil soap in her bath - additionally when you change her diaper just use clear water on a paper towel to clean her off and powder again with corn starch it will clear up quickly. The cookies are unrelated it is the ear that is the clue she has an ear infection that is manifesting in a yeast infection. Take her to the Dr tomarrow and have her ears checked and if she has an infection swithch her to soy for the antibiotic treatment or you will have to repeat this again in 2 weeks. Good Luck!|`|a4330ad1bed7f5694c842222ebfdd2e6aa	take the child to the doctor. she could have an infection from having antibotics when she had an ear infection|`|QcGd8ktAaa	Continue to put ointment or Vaseline on the rash.  If after 48 she still has diarrhea call your doctor.  If the diarrhea goes away then the rash should soon go to.  Using too many different creams can add to irritation so pick one and stick with it.  Sometimes diaper rashes can be caused by yeast in which case you will need a cream specifically for treating fungus.|`|gurR7Dhtaa	How much juice is she drinking? My son had this happen not long ago. Changing his diaper made me cry, and he even got tired of taking baths. I started giving him 1/4 Juice and the rest water. After 2 juice cups I switched to all water and just a splash of juice to flavor it. Also give her bananas right now. That will help stop the diarrhea. Make sure she drinks and drinks and drinks! Thats most important right now. Hopefully she likes pedialyte. Also I use Triple Paste. Its pricy but it works so well! Diarrhea can also mean infection. I would take her to the dr. Better safe than sorry.    Check out this link and good luck!!! Hang in there, it won't last forever, I promise!  http://diarrhea.emedtv.com/diarrhea/todd...|`|rqvbqdPpaa	try keeping the diaper off as much as possible (I know that's hard at her age) but that with baths, powder and no sugar should help.  Try the Bananna Applesauce, Rice and Toast diet for tomorrow after a call to the doc hopefully she'll feel better. Good luck. How long has it been since her last ear infection? I would call the doc in the am|`|EOQCbAdKaa	I would def. put ointment on.. If you cant get to the doctor soon then you should give her an oatmeal bath. It is very soothing for the skin. I think that if she has an ear problem it is probably causing sinus drainage which would cause the diarreah.|`|AA12391520	There are several remedies including a mix of 1 part 1% hydrocortisone cream, 1 part Monistat and 1 part Desitin (learned from and ER doc), just plan Desitin, A&D ointment, and one treatment my friend swears by is cooked flour - Seriously, put plain all purpose flour into a pan and cook it til it turns brown, then cool it and sprinkle over the baby's rash.  It's supposed to take the sting away and help clear it up.      There is also Nystatin cream that you have to get perscription from the doc.    Since she's had ear infections, if she's been or is currently on antibiotics, that could give her the runs, which in turn could irritate her tush...You definately want to put a call out to your doc and get the rash looked at as soon as possible.  If could also be a yeast infection in addition to a diaper rash, which you're gonna need a script for anyway, so you may as well take her in.      Frequent NO SOAP baths are good, frequent diaper changes, and also you can try leaving the baby with no diaper and let the rash get exposed to air...Put a waterproof pad under the baby and let her sleep with no diaper, or let her run around without a diaper for a little while...You may have a teeny mess to clean up, but everything being relative, I'd rather my daughter pee a little on my carpet and have her rash go away rather than keep her in a diaper round the clock.  Exposing it to air sometimes helps clear it up a lot faster than leaving her butt in the diaper all day.      You can also try (this is kinda messy) making some plain oatmeal, letting it cool, and then putting that on her butt, or putting the oatmeal into an old nylon and toss that in the bath with her - That way she gets the healing effects of the oatmeal without the oats going everywhere.      Poor girl...I feel so bad for her and for you, Mommy.  :-(  Hope it clears up really soon!!!|`|ctNNzYW6aa	Keep the rash dry.  Here's an old, tried and true remedy from my grandma:  Get some cornmeal and heat it in a skillet. After it cools, sprinkle it on baby's rash.  It works better than any powder or cream I've ever tried.  It absorbs liquid and comes off with the diaper instead of sticking to baby's skin.
z7w6xyOKaa	You don't look pregnant yet. Well not to where someone who didn't know could tell. But I see a little bit of a belly starting. Congrats|`|5MBdJK4Baa	hard to tell, give it a few more weeks!   Congrats!!|`|qBJLuCO0aa	you do look tad bit in the lower abdominal region but other than that you look great....|`|Spm9Raz9aa	it looks like your very early on but with a little baby bump. and people probably arent saying anything buecase they dont want to offend you. usually people wait till its a very visible baby bump to make comments about pregnancy :)|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I think you do, but people tend to not say anything too early on because they don't want to offend you if you aren't!  I don't think you are chubby!|`|bZBByJAAaa	Right now it looks like a beer belly. I hated that stage because people can't tell it's a baby and it looks like a beer belly. It bothered me because I'm skinny. I couldn't wait for my bump to get bigger and scream "pregnant."|`|7iylPJUraa	Awe, that's so cute. You're so lucky! |`|n8Z4ijr8aa	Hey there, I don't think it will be that noticable in a sweat or something loose, but in that top there is a distinctive area that suggests your are pregnant, nonetheless congratulations :)|`|0UOHex1Maa	You have a little baby bump coming. :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You definitely look pregnant to me.|`|rHufcHwHaa	you don't look pregnant yet.  how far along are you?|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Maybe a tiny bump. I'm gonna guess you're 14-17 weeks?      P.S.    You're in a pregnancy forum, I wouldn't throw the word "chubby" at you, so out of respect for us moms who ARE chubby, remind yourself that you are NOT. If you think you're chubby now..and you put on a lot of weight in your pregnancy like a lot of us moms did, then you're gonna have some serious issues!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Not really yet. How far along are you?  u look like I did up until I was about 5 months.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Well your tummy is as big as your butt so yes I think you do.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	You don't look pregnant to me but I bet you will soon:)|`|FufV5aZNaa	I see some bloat there.
rFtKFp03aa	Try rolling a blanket under his chest and arms or a bobby pillow is even better..     Let him get use to being propped up and then maybe see what he will do.     Give him something interesting to look at as well..     I like laying down on the floor in front of them and reading them a book, singing, or just talking to them.     Best Wishes.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Baby needs tummy time from day 1. He should already be lifting himself completely and some babies even trying to crawl ( rare ) It's ok though! Just make sure he gets lots of tummy time 30 minutes + a day everyday from now on. He can play on his tummy etc...He will catch up :)|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Put a toy in front of him and he'll concentrate on that toy. If he starts to cry, then get him off his tummy.|`|QcGd8ktAaa	You can't "get him to keep his head up."  He just needs to build up the muscle to do it.  You need to just patiently sit by and watch him work.  He will struggle at first but he will get better.  I wouldn't let him get too distressed though.|`|rqvbqdPpaa	Just hang out with him during tummy time and make sure he's getting tummy time. He'll build strength in his neck and be ok! He won't suffocate from putting his head down. Just make sure you're with him.|`|wjKzUbFfaa	let him practice a lot being on the tummy. Hell become stronger with time.|`|24RnTuB1aa	While most young babies hate tummy time, and all babies develop differently, by 5 months he should at least be able to pick his head up (and hold it up for a little while) while lying on his tummy. When I took my daughter to her 4-month check-up, she couldn't keep her head and chest up when she was on her tummy for more than a couple seconds. Her pediatrician said that there was bit of a delay and recommended physical therapy. It sounds like your son may be a little delayed as well. It turned out my daughter did have some muscle-tone issues - nothing serious, but enough of a problem that it merited some physical therapy, which helped a lot. I would talk to his pediatrician. If you catch these delays early, you can prevent them from causing more delays later on.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	I'm pretty sure that your son probably does the same thing as my daughter.  She is also 5 months and can hold her head up for long periods of time but LOVES to rub her face in the blanket.  IDK why, she always rubs it on my arm or in my chest when I hold her too.  She is just a snuggler.  I also find that when she does start to rub her face in the blanket while doing tummy time, that is a prelude to her being fussy.  She is definitely up on all fours or walking around yet.  She rolls over on OCCASION but can hold her head up for a while.  Like some of the other responders, I like to lay on the floor and play with her while she does tummy time since she has hated it from day 1.  best of luck!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well ideally you should have started a long time ago, but if you have a boppy pillow put him in the pillow with his shoulders over the  pillow with his arms over the pillow so he can be up and look around while he is on it....place some toys in view..if u dont have a boppy, try a rolled up blanket under his body in the same place so he can look around...he really should be holding his head up...isn't he able to do that yet?
4DoXomHZaa	There is a small chance.    Implant bleeding occurs to very few women, though every TTC lady out there hopes their periods or spotting is implant bleeding.    Implant bleeding, in the few times it occurs, is very light, pink, and short in duration-a day or two. It happens as early as 5 days up to 12 past ovulation.    If you were going to have a short cycle, yes, it's possible, but if you were having a longer 27 day one, you'd be ovulating about now.|`|BaXruEcqaa	14 days past ovulation?  Yes.|`|jaP0TANdaa	With such short cycles... it is possible, especially if you ovulate early (around CD7 or so). However, it could also be ovulation that causing some bleeding/spotting. Some women will experience this from time to time when they are ovulating. For your sake, I hope it's implantation! Good luck.|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	yes very possible  x|`|JOVWBOOCaa	anything is possible HOWEVER, not likely. It was more than likely ovulation. I spot and get cramps when I ovulate and I ovulate on about day 20 (10-12 days before my next period) So more than likely you have a short luteal phase and the spotting you saw was your ovulation. This would not take you out of normal range since luteal phase can be 10-16 days If you ovulated on the 14th day and add 10, that would give you a 24 day cycle, you could even have a luteal phase up to 13 and still have your 27 day cycle. 13-14 day phase is best for conception. IT all depends on your phase when you ovulate but to have implantation on the 14th day would probably mean you conceived a week or so before and that would be highly unlikely. Hope this helps and not too confusing!   BEst of luck to you!
rmse6Mj8aa	hey honey...    negative eh? sorry to hear that. dont give up though just wait it out and see what happens...  a lady on here had a negative hpt on 14 dpo and still was pregnant. didnt get her bfp til 16 dpo.    xxx|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Thanks for the info. I lengthened my luteal phase using 200mg of vitamin B6 daily.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I am one of the people who gets "late" BFPs - on 16 DPO if I have missed my period by 14 DPO.   So if you don't get AF by tomorrow, consider testing again on 15 or 16 DPO.    I have not used Vitex yet. I have a 13 to 14 day luteal phase, but I ovulate really late (depending on the specific cycle, anywhere between day 20 and 26 of my cycle - with my LP, that makes for a very long cycle!).  So I might try vitex if I don't conceive again this month, to see if I can my ovulation to occur a little bit earlier.
E9F6qjRWaa	some ppl believe that on certain phases of the moon you can have a better chance of getting pregnant?    but hey we all have different beliefs!!!      baby dust|`|43rP4HOxaa	Are you sure it wasn't "luteal phase"? The luteal phase is the time between ovulation and the start of your next period. I have seen a couple of calculators that asked for that.|`|imFpyj7Gaa	google it
AdbesQIzaa	I have implanon in my arm too and as far as im aware once removed has no effect on fertility so you can fall pregnant straight away.|`|ezMoS0mqaa	there's no firm answer for that unfortunately. It could be straight away but also wouldn't be unusual if it took up to or over a year,|`|WPI0Z47saa	I was going to get that until my ob said that sometimes it is hard to get pregnant for awhile after that and could take a year or more.|`|9Ycuoysjaa	im not 100% sure how long it may take but a member of my partners family had the implant, she had it removed and 3 months later she found out she was pregnant, so i dont think it would take ages to concieve, i suppose it would depend on how long you have had the implant for. You should speak to your doctor and see what he say's. Good luck hun.xx|`|AA10781522	With every woman it's different. It depends on your fertility and your age, usually the younger the more fertile. I would say probably within the first 3-6 months if not sooner.
kaqPSgTVaa	No. If anything you would get it early....And definitely not this late...Take a pregnancy test. You could very well be pregnant. ESPECIALLY if you've been having unprotected sex.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	You guys really do need to grow up! Don't call her a slut and assume she is a teenager, and so what if she was. At least she is on birthcontrol. More than half of teens aren't.    Honestly, i don't know the answer for sure, but i think your period would come late. If you stopped. The pills are probably still in your body.|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	It will be like starting Birth Control all over again, yes you might be late...|`|2qpBBTakaa	Going off birth control can mess up your cycle.  My ob/gyn told me that it can take as long as 6 months for your cycle to be back to normal.  You have to take pills every day for them to work too.|`|02CeuJtCaa	technically, i don't think so|`|dH6lBcGlaa	No, not if you finished the whole pack. Usually your period will come within a few days of finishing the pills. Your period will continue normally without taking the pills, just might be heavier and last longer.|`|NfKxRUo7aa	thats all we need  anotehr teenage pregnancy|`|EMiekqB2aa	no|`|33BB96x6aa	it is possible, but if your unsure you should always do a pregnancy test, or maybe grab a best friend and head to your local gp|`|1Ox4l5nnaa	even if you ran out, and you were taking bc for at least a few months and didnt miss a few pills, then the chance of you getting pregnant in the next six month are 1 in 6.     you are just late b/c of the birth control      YOU WEREN"T FU  ing w/o a condom and w/o b/c were u?    if you were....................................... WHORE|`|J4NgqZSIaa	OMG PPL NEED 2 QUIT IT W STUPID COMMENTS!!!! lol neways...from personal experience, i got my period sooner when i stopped. just a few days sooner but still. if stopped taking them dec 8 you shouldve got 2 periods by now. did u have unprotected sex at all? im wondering if you got pregnant? take a test to be sure.|`|wyiKkiiiaa	It's pretty common for your period to come earlier or later than usual when you switch off birth control, but take a test if it's by more than a week or so and you've been having unprotected sex.|`|fZrA0O1eaa	it's quite possible if you've had sex since then, that your eggo is preggo.  you're probably pregnant if you haven't had a period since december.|`|JCpKnotcaa	if you're not so sure on the pill, try taking the Depot shot. It last ups to 3 months and you can keep taking it as long as you get enough exercise and drink lots of dairy for strong bones. Every three months you take the shot.|`|wdgrsn86aa	dont use them whata retard|`|DGs4bJ5zaa	possibly until your body gets back on its normal track. and its TAKEN lol.
AA12000741	i never had any problems with anxiety or depression before pregnancy but during it my doc has prescribed me effexor a low dose and it seems to be helping...i was worried it wasnt safe to take while pregnant but he assured me i would be fine....|`|1EwbKkKCaa	wow that's weird I was on 10mg of lexapro when I got pregnant and they made me stop taking it.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	If there is no way you can go off of anti-depressants but you know you want another child, you can keep taking them during pregnancy.  If your doctor told you it is ok I know it seems like that would calm you down about doing it.. but I can understand your position because I was in that place once.    After having a miscarriage I had the worst depression set in, I was on many different kinds of anti depressants before Cymbalta finally started to work.  I stopped taking it the same time as my birth control and got pregnant the next month.  When I was about 6 weeks along the depression and anxiety came back full force.  Alot of it had to do with my job (which was working in a prison... and was where I was when I had my miscarriage BTW)  Anyways.. my doctor wanted to put me on anti depressants again and he went as far as scaring me with stories of people that DIDN'T do it and ended up in some kind of clinic or hurt their baby because they could not control the stress.  He went on to give several examples of patients of his whom had all given birth to very healthy babies though they were on on anti-depressants of every kind all throughout.     Long story short, if that is what you have to do, than do it.  The benefits outweigh the risks.|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is strange because my doctor cut me down on my antidepressants and told me to stop when I got to my third trimester to avoid birth defects when I had my first child. The weird thing was when I got pregnant my hormones got back into check or something and I ended up not needing them anyway and never when back on them again. I would be leery to take something like that and get pregnant on purpose. Is it really worth the risk of your child's health and well being?
Kl2bRSH2aa	i would write the letter to the guidance person and express in the letter what action you have already taken with this matter, make sure you tell them how frustrated you and your son both are with this situation.  Talk to your son and reassure him and tell him to ignore the boy who is still picking on him but to tell you everyday what if anything that happens, so you can keep a record of what is happening for any meetings you may have in the future regarding this matter.  If you are unhappy with the help you receive from the school make sure you express this, but make sure and be objective when it comes to what you may hear about your own child. Try and work with the school and work out what is best for your child.. Good Luck Hope You Get On OK..|`|lQ628oD7aa	give your son a 9 let him loose on these bitc Hes. hes on the right track with fighting he just needs 2 bump it up|`|k4y9ynUUaa	Tell him to get his own rival gang together, bigger than the bully's. Have a clubhouse out in your backyard and invite lots of boys over. The bully's will be so jealous their not invited. Then lets see if the bully's get him with his new gang.    If all else fails, send a male to school with him and have the male dress up with fake peircings and leather jackets.    Then have your son introduce him to the bully's.    It will scare the begeezus outta them!    Mrs.JasperHale|`|aBqJhdufaa	It happens all the time with the high schoolers being jerks to everybody younger and basically harassing us. We just fight back sometimes and they back off. You just need to have a violent rep lol.   Oh, and it's sissy, not cici.|`|rh9CRcXraa	I would wait and see what happens after you write the note to the guidance counselor.  This kind of stuff happens, and I think if we pull the kids from the school too soon, they are robbed of the opportunity to learn from it.  If it can't be resolved through the school administration, then I would consider dong something more drastic.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	bullying is illegal in almost all school districts.  file a police report and inform the school.|`|Ahud6tPZaa	Go straight to the Headmaster/Principal, they'll soon root out the troublemakers if you identify them.    I had 3 years of abuse when I was in high school, just because I was a bit "different". I was kicked, knocked down stairs, spat on, and had darts fired at me.    But a week after getting the Headmaster involved, I had no trouble again. The parents of the lads involved were mortified, and turned up to my house to apologise.    Now, I'm not saying every case works out the same way, but it's worth a try. Reporting it to teachers was how I tried to deal with it, but some of them laughed it off, and others told me to grow a backbone. But once I made the man at the top aware of what was going on, I started to see action taken.    As your son is of a young age, I'd suggest that you phone the school and ask for an appointment with the Head/Principal to discuss your concerns. They will likely be very receptive.|`|5D0KuT74aa	if they keep bugging him, tell him to to put the leader in a chokehold  it won't kill but it should knock him out for a few seconds  or, hire chuck norris|`|in7qi4oZaa	You son is just trying to defend himself.|`|GPvpbO9qaa	sounds like thos boys just need a good a?se kickin to me,|`|hIFXFmzAaa	personaly i think he should become stronger and better at fighting. But violence never solves the problem. I am an extremely protective person so i would talk to the kids myself and intimidate or just make sure they know what there doing has concequences. I strongley do NOT switch schools because of friends he already has. Maybe you should talk to the kids dads not moms because fathers inforce rules better.  If all else fails go with him to school.|`|9dNcEfKXaa	it normal it even to me when I was in high school. Just tell him to ignore them that was my solution or if you don't really feel comfortable living him there I think you change his school then.
NC1yS0H5aa	maybe take old magazines and cut out pictures then let your son use a glue stick or glue to make collages on paper. i was able to do that with my daughter at 15 months and she loved it as well as sticking stickers on paper. at that age they can often begin to pretend so you could take out some dishes and stuffed animals and have a pretend tea party or picknick. all art supplies you can dig out or reading books. if it is physical play he needs and he is aleady walking a game of chase. throwing or rolling a ball. playing in the snow for short bursts making snow angels and snowmen.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	Poor you! I'm in Texas, so no snow here. You'll just have to play some games with him and hope it clears up soon.|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Read him stories, play with his toys, watch a DVD together, put some music on and dance, cuddle up in a blanket or draw/paint.|`|kiJUCYMcaa	play, watch telly, try to make him dance if he can, listen to music, watch a dvd, play with some toys|`|rISHTfK3aa	There are lots of things you can do    Play with water  Use Play dough  Use cornflour  Read books  Dance to music  Paint  Play with a ball  Play hide and seek    The list is endless|`|o1KWtGzLaa	Haha, I was about to suggest a playstation until I saw his age, definitely don't do that!    Play with toys, big baby blocks and cars seem to be the best at keeping baby boys out of trouble I think.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	MAWM has the right idea.   Kids are entertained by the simplest things.  Do spend time out in the snow!  It is great fun for little explorers.  Use socks as mittens, if need be.  OR   Go out and gather snow into the biggest mixing bowl you own.  Bring it in. and let him play with your kitchen gadgets, spoons, spatulas, cups, bowls and lids, etc.|`|OqjNyUgDaa	Toys  Television  Cooking  Drawing|`|7898bed61433434531784bc3ff2ec3e9aa	Let him have a bubble bath with toys while you sit near by tub and look at magizine or book.    make tents over chairs and tables with blankets|`|5NhartQ3aa	If you have a new toy for him, give it to him so he can play with the box!!  lol  Enjoy the day off!

smsUZG4Iaa	there are many things a man can do to increase sperm count...  1. Have sex & masturbate less often - the more times you ejaculate, the less dense your semen will be. Maintain a gap of 3 days between two consecutive ejaculations.    2. Refrain from habits like smoking, alcohol consumption etc. - Alcohol affects your liver function, which, in turn, causes a dramatic rise in estrogen levels. Even two drinks a day will have long-term effects on sperm production    3. Exercise regularly.Exercising your PC muscle can help you shoot further than ever before.    4. Eat Nutritious Food - Diet that's low in fat, and high in protein, vegetables, and whole grains is good for your health and for your sperm. Avoid bitter, astringent and spicy foods.Reduce caffeine intake    5. Avoid heating of testicles - Wear loose, cotton boxer shorts, Avoid hot baths and saunas    6. Lose any excess weight, which tends to cause testosterone/estrogen imbalances.    7. Reduce stress levels by learning relaxation techniques - Keep your mind and body healthy by regular practice of YOGA and MEDITATION.    8. Massage body with herbal oil, which improves blood circulation.    9. Try supplements - Certain natural supplements promise to increase sperm production. Checkout some Natural and Herbal, no side effects supplements at    10. Make love in the early morning or afternoon. Sperm levels are often highest in the mornings.   you can also try taking Zinc.. it should help increase your sperm count with out any side effects.. If all else fails ask the doctor to prescribe you some clomid to increase your sperm count.. i really hope this helps.. just remember Stress really affects any thing having to do with making a baby.. hints the acupuncture.. well best of luck..
0VHolTVEaa	I think your friends baby will be fine, as long as her head is not shaken alot. If she doesnt cry then she cant be in pain so i wouldnt worry. Some babies need movement and thats sometimes the best way. I wouldnt worry, as long as she is ok. Just keep an eye so she doesnt hurt the baby. Pat yourself on the back for being a great friend for her|`|dZ78IohLaa	Well I wouldnt do it, you shouldnt shake babies as their skulls are not as hard and it can do a lot of damage.|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	Its FRIEND doh|`|irP2yTMWaa	Is the baby crying cause it hurts ??? No lots of mums do it to get the baby to sleep|`|rR4q2e9qaa	Unless her head is snapping forward and back hard it's fine.|`|2dxlnfJYaa	Both of my babies liked this also and they are both very healthy. Some babies have to be moved all the time, it's usually an indication they will be active toddlers. I think I'm more worried for you since you don't know how to spell friend?? It's I before E except after C. Hope this helps.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, some babies really like this.  It's fine.|`|X4hz3a9haa	No , but she really should let the baby settle herself rather than rocking her every time, she is making a "rod for her own back" by doing so.|`|MeYILJeSaa	No.   Bouncing is fine. Sometimes I have to bounce my baby to get him to calm down-it's very soothing to babies.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	My eldest son liked to be bounced really fast too. He would cry and whine until we did it. As long as the baby isnt being fully shaken to the point her wee head is bouncing about badly then she's fine.|`|1S5AbPueaa	My friend had to do the same thing to her son.He was a high maintenance baby and he would not sleep unless she was rocking his car seat,fast and hard.He is now 3 and totally ok.

If not, why do you choose a tribal name?  At least you know better than to spell it Shy-Anne or something equally weird. It peaked in popularity in the 90s but it's still over-used.    I heartily dislike using tribal names as first names; it seems so disrespectful.    To stay with the same initials, why not try  Calla Joy  Cecily Joy  Cecelia Joy  Charisse Joy  Charlotte Joy  Christian Joy  Claudia Joy ("Army Wives")  Cosette Joy    Good luck to you.
ihBFGugIaa	She should be able to speak to any Private Adoption Attorney in her area.  She needs to probably get a move on it, these things take time.  I wish her luck|`|29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	She will not have trouble finding adoptive parents.  Many even run ads in the newspaper instead of going through an agency.  I would do an internet search in your area.
2irmTjQ3aa	Yea it might be too early. Wait a few days and take another one, or go get a blood test|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    Definitely possible darling    i adivse you wait anothr 5 - 7 days and test again. You levels may have not been high enough for the pregnancy test to detect.  if you test and it comes up neg again.  blood test at the doctors is 100% accurate.Take care & take your prenatal Vitamins for sure. Act like you are pregnant darling.    God Bless x|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	There's still a chance that you could be pregnant and your pregnancy hormones weren't high enough for the test. I would wait a week and if you still haven't gotten your period, test again with the morning pee.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Yes, you can always have a false negative test. Buy another, "good" name brand and test with your morning urine, which will have the strongest level of hormones.    Good luck!|`|lMUCtrFHaa	get a new test. could be low hCG level that contribute to the negative result if you are preggo. good luck.|`|wiPAz9uGaa	Idk stop having sex. Like does know one have self control anymore. Your vag is gonna get all stretched out. Ah to be a virgin.|`|4N91sG5Iaa	it might but not really its mite mean to much excisse or lack of diet but check get a test donee|`|u09yhpkpaa	it's definitely possible. you should probably just wait a couple of days and try testing again. if you still haven't started and the test is negative you could go in for a blood test.|`|aBiGPrtJaa	yes i think you could be.. i was late with mine and my first test was one pink line and one lite pink line! and then i took another one the next day and the lines were brighter! so just wait another day and try again! i hope i helped a little lol! good luck!!|`|uNsWwMfwaa	Most likely it's just stress.  Obviously the other people answering this don't know what they're talking about because by the time your menstrual cycle starts, or fails to start, that is the optimum time to take a pregnancy test.  Here's a little lesson in reproduction for you, but you have to have had sex either 2-3 days before you ovulated or day of ovulation for this to be true.      Within 24-hours after fertilization, the egg begins dividing rapidly into many cells. It remains in the fallopian tube for about three days. The fertilized egg (called a zygote) continues to divide as it passes slowly through the fallopian tube to the uterus where its next job is to attach to the endometrium (a process called implantation). First the zygote becomes a solid ball of cells, then it becomes a hollow ball of cells called a blastocyst. Before implantation, the blastocyst breaks out of its protective covering. When the blastocyst establishes contact with the endometrium, an exchange of hormones helps the blastocyst attach. Some women notice spotting (or slight bleeding) for one or two days around the time of implantation. The endometrium becomes thicker and the cervix is sealed by a plug of mucus.    Within three weeks, the blastocyst cells begin to grow as clumps of cells within that little ball, and the baby's first nerve cells have already formed. Your developing baby is called an embryo from the moment of conception to the eighth week of pregnancy. After the eighth week and until the moment of birth, your developing baby is called a fetus.      So, in all likelihood, NO you're not pregnant.  It may more likely be stress, illness, medications including birth control pills, and other problems (such as cysts) that may change the pattern, poor nutrition, including eating disorders, depression, extreme weight loss, overexercising, hormonal problems including thyroid disorders and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  It's also not uncommon to have a variation in one month.    Missing more than two periods in a row is unhealthy. It can put you at risk for uterine cancer because of the excessive exposure to estrogen. On the other hand, missing a period from a lack of estrogen can increase the risk of osteoporosis.  Irregular periods may mean you are not ovulating properly. This can be of great concern to women trying to get pregnant.    So if anything stressful is going on in your life, or your depressed, exercising too much, not eating properly, etc., etc. could be the cause of you not having a period.  Because if you're regular in your cycles, then, IF you were pregnant, you would've come up positive on that test.  If you've only recently started getting your period, like in the last couple of years or less, then it's normal to miss a period here or there because your body is getting used to all the hormones and trying to find a "even keel" for itself.  But from what information you've given, no, I think it's highly unlikely you're pregnant.
CxRJwJsraa	Many of these are on my own list.    Beatrix- I really like this. but I LOVE Beatrice. Not sure what it is about the x that makes it not quite as appealing, but I still think it's nice...just not as nice as Beatrice. (I also really like Beatriu..BEE-uh-true)  Briony- LOVE this!!! This is one of my favorite names! It's beautiful.  Carys- I love this too. I just prefer the spelling Charis (but I realize this is a different name with different background/meaning).   Cordelia- Lovely. I think she makes a stunning middle name.  Della- cute. This could actually work as a nic for Cordelia.  Emmeline- LOVE this!!   Esme- cute, but lately I'm seeing it sooo much, thanks to Twilight. (I should amend that statement. I'm seeing it more online, but not on real babies).  Etta- cute, but I prefer her as a nic for something else. I tend to like it for Violet or Scarlett.  Geogiana- I used to not like this, thought I LOVE Georgia. However, lately I'm warming up to it.  Hermione- soo sweet. But, I'm afraid everyone will only think Harry Potter. Perhaps a middle name contender.   Hero- I know she was a woman in Greek mythology, but many think this name is boyish. And I'm not sure it would really work as a first name...but I think it might be a cool middle name.  Imogen- Love it!  Inara- This is the first one on the list that is new to me, but I think it's lovely.  Isadora- I'm usually not big on the DOR sound, but I'm developing a soft-spot for this name.   Lenore- This is alright. But I much prefer Leonor.  Lucinda- Not a big fan. I tend to not like -inda names. However, I do like Jacinda (mostly because my roommate in college whom I adored was named this).  Mirabelle- LOVE it!! I just prefer the more stream-lined Mirabel.  Portia- I love it, and I love the Shakespeare association. But, I hate the association with Porche and pigs (thanks to the meaning)  Ramona- cute.  Rosalind- LOVE It!!, but Rosaline is on my list.  Saffron- LOVE this!!! sooo cute.  Viola- Love this too, but only if said VY-oh-luh, and not vy-OH-luh.  Wren- love it. it feels professional and kinda hippyish at the same time.|`|933XLRGCaa	Some of these are a bit weird for my taste, but here are the ones I do like:  Cordelia  Mirabelle  Isadora|`|R2OMEjrhaa	I like emmaline and wren. the others arent really my style lol though some of them are pretty. these two are the only ones i would consider.|`|AA11490722	i really like Rosalind and Briony|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I like:    Emmeline-Great alternative to the ever popular Emma and Emily.  Imogen-Very sweet name  Portia-Sounds somewhat like the popular Sophia, a great alternative  Rosalind-I prefer Rosalie but this is still very pretty|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Beatrix  -  lilke Aunt Bea  Briony  Carys  Cordelia   -  a book character  Della   -  Perry Mason's secretary, a beauty  Emmeline  -  so feminine!

I saw it and starred it last night, but I didn't have time to answer it. I'll rate them each on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love) and comment.    Beatrix ~ 2 (I've never liked the sound of this. It reminds me of a little fairy in a fairytale story. Plus, I just don't like the way it sounds.)    Briony ~ 5 (It's ok. I hated it when I first saw it, but I'm warming up to it a bit.)    Carys ~ 1 (I know a little girl with this name. I just really don't like it. Not because of her or anything--she's a sweet little girl--I just hate the name.)    Cordelia ~ 8 (It's really pretty.)    Della ~ 5 (It's ok. You never hear this name. I'm actually kind of surprised, considering how popular "ella" names are, especially Bella. It's very similar. I'm guessing people will "re-discover" it sooner or later, considering it seems to fit in with the current naming trends.)    Emmeline ~ 10 (I love this name. It's on my favorites list. I'm currently in the process of finding the perfect middle name for it. One of my options, actually, is Cordelia. I'm very surprised to see this name isn't in the top 1000. I guess it's not as popular as I thought. I think it'll be within the top 1000 next year though.)    Esme ~ 3 (I used to like it, but I don't really anymore.)    Etta ~ 2 (I don't like the sound of it.)    Geogiana ~ 4 (How would this be pronounced? George-e-anna? It's ok.)    Hermione ~ 2 (For some reason it remindws me a bit of macaroni. It's not terrible, just definitely not my taste.)    Hero ~ 1 (I really don't like this!)    Imogen ~ 1 (I don't like this one. Ever since I've heard it, it just doesn't sound pleasent to me.)    Inara ~ 3 (Not completely sure how to pronounce this one...)    Isadora ~ 5 (It's ok. I'm actually kind of surpriseed this isn'tin the top 1000 either. It fits with the current naming trends and is similar to the  1 girls name, Isabella.)    Lenore ~ 9 (I think it's really pretty.)    Lucinda ~ 9 (I like the sound of it.)    Mirabelle ~ 5 (It's ok. Kinda cute.)    Portia ~ 1 (I've never liked this. Reminds me of the word "portion" and the car.)    Ramona ~ 7 (I like this one.)    Rosalind ~ 3 (Roz-uh-lind or Rose-uh-lind? I don't really care for this variation of Rose actually. Although I do like Rose and Rosette and Rosetta.)    Saffron ~ 1 (I don't like it. For some odd reason, it's reminds me of Daffy Duck. I know, weird, right?)    Viola ~ 2 (I don't like it.)    Wren ~ 2 (I absolutely hated it when I first saw it. I think it has grown on me a tiny tiny bit.)    Nice question! I enjoyed answering. Would you mind making another one? Boys names perhaps? Just an idea. I'd love to answer it. =)|`|2EcyWp2baa	I really like Beatrix.|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	I like Portia, Viola and Emmeline.|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	Quite unusual..|`|ot0TqzSvaa	theyre not in the top 1000 for a reason.    sorry but i dont like any of these besides maybe Imogen, Della, and Emmeline.     i like:     Mabel  Aili (means 'sweet' in german)  Briley  Gigi  Abril  Keanah  Bluze  Kirraley  Ameeka  Piper  Jalyn  Zaylie  Aida  Kiyah  Silver  Blu  Echo   Blaise  Aili  - 'Sweet'  Aara -  'Adoring'   Abela -  'Breath'  Dakota - 'Friend'  Ziva -  'Bright, Radiant'   Damita - 'Little Princess'  Vera - 'The True'|`|DePoXqSbaa	Portia, Isadora, Emmeline, Carys (this is in the like, top 100 by the way!) and Esme are all unbelievable gorgeous!|`|hlztyMYyaa	Briony  and    Emmeline this one is my favorite|`|pTcyhs9Maa	Everyone has different tastes, so when the time comes just go with a name YOU love.      Out of your list - I really love the name Cordelia.  It's always been a favorite of mine and reminds me of Shakespeare.|`|J4NgqZSIaa	none of them!!!|`|ylCxHCKkaa	Some of those are great. I like Beatrix, Emmeline, Lucinda, and Portia|`|AA11373813	I like Carys and Emmeline.  My grandma's name is Della.|`|bSPTbrGpaa	Hmmm... Firefly and Shakespeare fan aren't we?  Anyway here are my ratings    Beatrix - 5/10 - Good old fashioned name, however, I immediately associate it with Beatrix Potter and am not too fond of the nickname Bea.     Briony-2/10- Sounds too much like it's trying to convert the male name Bryon into a masculine sound.     Carys-9/10 for sound 5/10 for overall name potential- I like the sound of the name, it's very soft, however, it looks too made-up. (Even though it's a real name)    Cordelia -7/10- I actually prefer the nickname Delia, however, it's still a very nice name    Della-7/10    Emmeline- 9/10- Very lovely, quite classic and yet at the same time fits as a modern name    Esme -6/10    Etta-2/10- Too hard sounding for my tastes    Georgiana -1/10- Have never liked this name. Same problem as with   Briony.    Hermione-2/10- Hmm... Wasn't particularly fond of this name pre-Harry Potter and now I think it wouldn't be appropriate to name anyone this name for a while.    Hero-2/10- Too many expectations and too much teasing would follow this name. Hero is a title that should be bestowed later in life.    Imogen- 7/10 - Very nice and traditional. Evokes a lovely setting.    Inara -8/10 for sound, 3/10 for naming value- It is a lovely name, however, as long as Firefly has a cult following and the character from Firefly is known (I don't think too many little girls would like to google their name and find they were named after a geisha/prostitute character) it would be inadvisable to use this as an actual name.    Isadora-5/10-Very nice, but I don't like the nickname Dora    Lenore- 7/10 I like the meaning of the name and it sounds like a good, solid name, but would mostly depend on what the last name would be    Lucinda- 8/10- Quite pretty    Mirabelle     Portia - 8-10 - I like this a lot. Strong name, and also one of the Bard's more interesting female characters. Good namesake, if that's the case, and still a good name on it's own.    Ramona- 4/10 - Makes me think of the character from the Gargoyles series....    Rosalind- 9/10 - I happen to love this name. Dainty without overdoing it like with most of the Rose names.    Saffron-2/10- Both because it is a spice and due to the same reasons as Inara.    Viola-2/10- I here the name, and think the instrument. Imagine Viola playing the viola at school. Too much teasing. Besides, Twelfth Night isn't my favourite of the comedies.    Wren- 2/10- It's a small bird. Yes, the name sounds nice without other associations, however, it would be better off in the middle name category.    There's my two cents. Hope you're not offended! :)|`|d3IcVDNFaa	Emmeline is different.  Portis is ok.  Rosalind is ok.  Lenore is different.|`|oqhF2Gsaaa	Beatrix - makes me think of Beatrix Potter. old, english.  Briony - i think of the ocean. its cute.  Carys - dont like it. i think of dead skin.  Cordelia - old.. dont really like it.  Della - never heard it. its alright i suppose.  Emmeline - love this name. so pretty.  Esme - never really liked this name... looks weird written down and sounds weird.  Etta - jazz singer. i dont like it so much.  Geogiana - average... a bit different.  Hermione - harry potter. dont use it, ever. there will be a bit of teasing. most likely anyway.  Hero - sweet as  Imogen - cute i think  Inara - VERY different.  Isadora - makes me think of lizards  Lenore - sounds like a boys name  Lucinda - derailed! cute name..  Mirabelle - dont like it.  Portia -  i think of witches and sorcery..  Ramona - cute, i know a girl with this name. she was pretty and so nice  Rosalind - i like rosalie, so much. rosalind is weird.  Saffron - dont really like it.  Viola - cute!  Wren - like it but sounds masculine.|`|EcdelIHtaa	weird   but i like PORTIA ROSALIND and MIRABELLE|`|Elxuvon8aa	I really like Cordelia as cordell is my fave male name   Georgiana is great too.

AwvWBROlaa	its just a personal opinion...but I would stay home for 4 months with two kids. I would want to spend more quality time with the newborn baby and i would also save 4 months worth of daycare for my older child. Like you said.. we live in the real world and free vacation like this dont come too often. Its whole 4 months to rest and catch up with your family =)|`|rFtKFp03aa	I would do 4 months of special one on one time rather than taking him to work, trying to work, and only giving him part of your attention for 6 months..     Best wishes|`|XOtOMncwaa	Stay at home, try to relax and enjoy yourself for a little while... it would be hard to watch your baby and work at the same time anyway... bonding at home is so much better! Then you wont have to pay for childcare expenses for your other child so it will be a perfect opportunity to save up! Good luck to you, and ignore people like Mandy!|`|BMfn0D9gaa	stay at home. your baby is only little for a short period!|`|YrK7S8xtaa	Stay at home, i wish i had the opportunity to stay home with my baby when its born.|`|hFvEvkqoaa	i would take maternity leave for four months because if u were to take a newborn to work with you it would be exsposed to alot of germs|`|WqkOI7RDaa	Stay home. It's better for your kids and your coworkers.|`|ctNNzYW6aa	Wow. You must be really valuable to your employer if you're getting this offer.  I think you should go back to work because it secures your career future AND allows you time with the new baby.  Most working moms don't get this chance.  Disregard the naysayers and focus on what's real.. and what's real is that you're a working mom. Working moms raise their kids and raise them well.  More employers should think like yours evidently does.|`|bc9inzicaa	If I were you, I would take the four months off for that special one on one with the baby.  If you take the bring to baby to work deal, depending on your job and work environment, you still may not be able to spend time with your baby.  Imagine taking a phone call from an important business associate with your little one screaming his or her head off...    From my experience, my baby tends to wake up at the worst time...right when i sit down for a meal, when i am about to take a shower, etc.    Trust me, the four months will fly by and you'll be back to work before you know it. At least by then you will have some great memories of the time you spent with your little one.    But whatever you decide, best of luck with your baby!  :)
bAp35x7uaa	No, they won't harm the foetus. Birth control contains progesterone which is a pregnancy hormone - the pill works by making your body think it is already pregnant.  So basically you're just putting extra pregnancy hormones in your system.  However as soon as your pregnancy is confirmed you should stop because extended use may cause problems.      http://www.healthywomen.org/healthtopics...|`|6sAbs2iiaa	yes it can harm the fetus even your baby so stop taking the pills and keep your legs closed till you know for sure if you are pregnant or not.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If you've been taking your birth control properly up to this point, you aren't pregnant.  Call your doctor or pharmacist - they will be able to answer your questions from a medical perspective.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i was 10 weeks pregnant when i found out and i had been on the nuva ring the whole time- he is now almost 22 months old and is fine|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The birth control pill will have no effect on a fetus if you are already pregnant.  It is best to keep taking the pill until you know for sure if you are pregnant or not otherwise you'll really mess up your cycle and if you weren't pregnant to begin with, you'll put yourself at risk of getting pregnant.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	well if you are pregnant you dont need the birth control anymore do you?|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is no evidence that taking the pill during the early weeks of pregnancy does ANY harm. (Many women become pregnant on the pill, and aren't aware of it at first.)    Keep taking your pills.  If you don't get your period at the end of the pack, dont' start the new pack until you can confirm or rule out pregnancy.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	The Pill While Pregnant   Could it be harmful? Here are opinions and input:       If you accidentally took some birth control and then found out you are pregnant, the baby should be fine. However, see your doctor to make sure you are taking the right steps.     Studies have shown that taking birth control pills while pregnant results in an increased risk of birth defects.     The writing on the package states "Discontinue use if you become pregnant." If you know that you're pregnant stop taking the pills. (They wouldn't do you much good anyway!)     I think what this question is asking is if you're pregnant but don't know it yet and you're still taking the pill, if it's dangerous to the fetus. Well, I'm in that exact situation right now, and my doctor and obstetrician both said not to worry about it.     There is no proof that the birth control pill will harm your baby. If you are sure you are pregnant, stop taking the pill and see your doctor. Don't be overly alarmed if this happens. It's happened to others like yourself and the babies turn out perfectly healthy.     From what I have read yes it can. Look on any warning labels or the fact sheet sometimes given with the prescription. You should get to your doctor immediately for a test and discuss with him also       You REALLY shouldnt be taking birth control if your pregnant|`|cjqOUq5xaa	I dont think that 2 weeks would hurt-but they do tell you to stop taking birth control right away. I would say that your best bet would be to call your dr. and ask them!|`|15fc25ee9df658e7846b111f7aea54beaa	if you are pg why in the hell would you take birth controle pills .stupid|`|AA11176438	do not take the birth control if u think u r pregnant it will hurt the unborn baby... jus dont take them til u kno for sure...|`|XyAWAoSoaa	I wouldn't take them however when I found out I was pregnant I was 4 weeks and had taken the pill because I thought implantation bleeding was my period. Sounds stupid I know.. but the baby was a-okay.    If there is a big chance you may pregnant I'd just stop. If you end up not being pregnant just start again after your next period and use condoms (or don't have sex) in between if you do not want a baby.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Depends when you got pregnant....when did you mess up the pills?    Massive amounts of hormones are not good for a baby of course, but they early on, for a couple weeks, it doesn't do harm. But longer periods of time increase the risk.    If it's been more than 2 weeks since the screw up, you can take a test now and find out.|`|tkqGwbtHaa	it is a possibility but its like smoking while pregnant, there is no REAL evidence but why take the chance? as a precaution i would stop taking it until you know for sure. you can take a pregnancy test as early as two weeks after conception, you cannot always rely on getting your period, many women still get their period while pregnant.

3qI1oyFaaa	Your belly gets hard from your uterus expanding. Your uterus is about a half inch above your pubic bone at 13 weeks--feel right above your pubic bone and you'll feel it.

wziUVyVoaa	Aeris Jordan - Aeris is a character on a video game my husband played all the time when he was little. It kinda became something close to his heart. He had it in his mind that he wanted to name his first daughter that for years before he even met me. When he said the name, I thought it was breathtakingly beautiful. It means "earth", which is an even bigger plus, considering I'm a little bit of an eco-friendly-freak =). Jordan is a name that I've always liked for a girl (along with Dylan, Presley, Price, Peyton, Logan, Blake, etc.) and it's also the name of my first cousin that was like a brother to me. It means to flow down or the Jordan river, which is another plus, considering the name together means Earth and water.    Gavin Henry - Gavin is the name my husband chose because he's always liked it. Plus, he has alwayssss loved Gavin Rossdale (the singer). I have two younger family members named Gavin, one of them is one of the brightest and nicest kids I know, and the other is only 3 and is already a heartbreaker. Henry was my grandfather's name. He was the greatest person I've ever known, and I think it's a huge honor to be able to create someone and give them the same name. I fought with it over and over in my head because I didn't want him to feel like he had to live up to my grandfather, but in the end I'm very happy with my decision. Gavin means a white hawk and is also the name of an ancient warrior, and Henry means the ruler of the house. The two together seem to make a strong name.    If we ever had other kids, we have considered -  Jackie Peyton (after my grandmother)  Elizabeth Presley (after my mother)  Dylan Caroline (after his mother)  Jarrett Eugene (after his father, my father, and my father's father)  Ryan Price  Logan Jade  Jayden Reece  Bailey Peyton  McKenna Caroline  etc.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Have 2 grown sons.  One is named Gary Dean.  No reason or meaning behind it other than at the time I really liked how it sounded and decided to use it.  The other is Thomas Brian.  I wanted Brian Thomas but my hubby wanted the first name after him, so I said ok but would never make a Jr. so I chose Brian for middle name which is different from my husbands middle name.|`|we0xPfYLaa	My daughters name is Madison Rose.  Her name was going to be Riley Katherine but we decided to change it when we found out we were having a girl.  I later found out that Rose is my great grandmothers name.  Madison was just a name we liked.  We call her Maddie.|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	cute name!    i like sophia claire  and gavin elijah!|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I have (in order)    Adarah Ley-Kavee  Tristan Philip Clark  Elanor Wendy Elizabeth  Faelene Ariel Yvonne  Lillian Cassandra Paige  and our son on the way will be either Franklin Dwaine Galbreathe or  Falcon Joseph Michael.    The oldest two don't really have meaning behind their names (other than I thought it sounded pretty)  Except the Clark part of my son's name, it's an anagram for a bunch of his dad's family names.    Elanor is a little yellow flower in the book "Lord of the Rings" (my favorite) and means Sunstar.  Faelene's initials spell FAYT which her dad and I felt brought us together.  (my oldest daughter supplied the A for her middle initials "Mommy, you should name her....belle ariel jasmine")  Lillian's middle names are the names my mother wanted to give me when  I was born but my father said no.    And my son....there's a bit of drama there.  The franklin name is for my father, my father in law, and my husband's grandfather.  the falcon name is my husband and my best friends.|`|wsHgMp93aa	I'm 3 months along and if its a girl it will be Bella Sophia because it means beautiful wisdom and Sophia is my cousin's name.

Everyone in my family has Thomas somewhere in their name and Moore is because when my sons father was 3 months old he was adopted by his stepfather and took on his last name.  He wanted his biological last name "moore" in there so his son would honor both of the names.   My daughter is Karli Michelle so she would have the same initials as me.  My name is Kelly Marie..|`|2nWKxv7Waa	My son's name is Cade Nathanael. Cade means "Warrior" and Nathanael means "Gift from God". I struggled with infertility and it took us 3 1/2 yrs to finally get pregnant with him. So, we feel his name truly has a signifcant meaning behind it. And, my son is every bit of a warrior also. He is 4 1/2 yrs old now and in pre-school.

And Joy Because when she was born Hannah was always saying that she was such a joy to have around! Also it is my Moms name!    Sophie was suposed to be a boy called Spencer but the ultrasound was wrong and out popped Soph! She was originally going to be named after a lady we knew called Clarabella, but she died so Dad didn't want to name her after Clarabella fully, so they just called her Sophie Bella!
2xS1Jro7aa	Put his hand in a bowl or bucket of ice and water it will numb his finger if when he takes it out it still hurts I would take him to the walk in clinic because its most likely broken :( poor little guy! Who ever said that shes a lousy parent re read what she wrote she is saying she doesn't have time to go to walmart because he is in so much pain and she doesn't want him to be in pain while they go to walmart and get something! I hope he feels better! Other wise you could do the water and ice thing and get his fingers numb and then put ice in a bag and then go to walmart and get some children's Tylenol but if it really still hurts take him to the doctor if its broken or fractured they will get him a finger splint and some meds that will help it not work and he will feel allot better. When his hand is in the water and ice give him something distracting and be silly so he isant thinking of it. Good luck! I hope hes ok!|`|jLYTKr33aa	First of all, you should not be on here if he's screaming and crying.  Get away from the computer and bring him to the ER immediately.  That's what you should have done in the first place.  The poor boy's finger could be broken.  Please, try to use better judgment in the future.  And don't give me the "we don't have time" BS.  When a child is injured, you make time to get them what they need.  It's called being a parent.  Otherwise, you're neglecting him.  *ETA* You don't need to settle him down before taking him to the emergency room.  In case you haven't noticed, ER's aren't usually the calmest places.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	Take him to the doctor or ER right away.|`|JaiepxZ2aa	Amputate hisarm, or give him 3 bottlesof tylonol|`|OzzZF9Xuaa	i would give him either advil which is an anti inflammatory or maybe a half vicodin depending on his weight|`|h4ySdSCQaa	i would say Tylenol and ice it and if it doesn't look any better then take him to the docs|`|cCwO36Ubaa	Trust me I've been there. I have plenty scars on my fingers from that. Have a doc take a look at it just to see if anything is wrong with the bone. Try something he likes to give him it may calm him enough to get a pain med. Once u find one|`|avfJI5CGaa	If you have time to go on yahoo answers and ask this question, then you have time to go to walmart or someplace like that and get medicine. Put some ice on his finger and take him to the doctor to make sure it's not broken. If it's bleeding you should put some anibiotic ointment on the wound. You shouldn't worry about getting embarassed in public with his screaming and crying and worry more about getting your son some help. I broke my leg recently and had to go to the ER. Did I wait for it to stop hurting before I went? No!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Make time and get him to the Dr.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If it hurts that bad he needs the attention of a DOCTOR and not his stepmom.

If he can bend the finger once he calms down, with no pain, most likely not broken finger. If he can't bend the finger, may be broken. regardless, put some ice on the finger. Get a warm wrag, place the wrag over the finger, place ice, or bag of pees, over the finger.. let it stay like that for about 15 minutes. Give him some child tylenol to relieve the pain. Monitor to make sure not broken...|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    if he is not bleeding and you have not put anything yet i would advice to put his fingers in Brandy for sometime and then apply any antiseptic cream...(this is what i was treated as when i smashed my fingers in the door when i was a kid..)  i felt really nice after it..    hope this helps you..!!|`|hkQSqPEwaa	I would get on YA while my step son was hurting.|`|x6UJe8jkaa	How about getting off the computer and holding him?
zuZKj3xXaa	i may be getting one too.. my doctor hasn't really been to straight fwd about it. and im due any time really :( he told me that if everything goes ok while im progressing naturally, that we wont have to do the csection! yay :) lol im scared of epidurals and being put out too.. i can tell you right now, thats why i dont want the csection lol if the csetion is planned, they wont put you out, they will numb you from underneath your chest and Down. you'll be awake the whole time if u decide to be :) if i get the csection, ill be awake :)     36 weeks and 4 days!|`|jrVlzffeaa	Did your doctor tell you why you have to have a c section? Like your doctor said try not to worry about it now, maybe by the time you're 7months gone you wont need a c section? Good luck, I'm sure you'll be fine. Last minute my midwife couldn't tell if it was my son's head that was down in my pelvis or his butt (breech position) so I had to have a scan to check but luckily he was head down. I know that fear of having to have a c section and the ONLY thing that comforted me was that having a c section was what's best for my son, not for me, for my son Xx    EDIT: If you don't mind can you elaborate on why? i've never heard of some one having to have a c section because of the pressure from pushing? Thanks Xx|`|EsaFg8eaaa	When I have a baby I will have to have a c-sectoion too, but for lots of other reasons. I feel your pain..not really sorta..

EtCRnDJMaa	Good for you for not getting one!  That must have been truly the best time of your life to see your healthy baby!  and to be fine yourself!  I am very happy it worked out for you.  My mom was about 4 months pregnant with me and her water broke.  She thought she should have an abortion.  The Dr would not, because she was at St. Francis Hospital, a catholic hospital.  He said lets just let nature take it's course and see what happens.  Here I am...39 years old, nothing wrong with me.  Good thing she was at the catholic hospital!!!    Sometimes women or teens may choose to have an abortion.  hey have every right to, this is why we love and live in the USA.  We don't have to like what anyone does and we surely don't have to follow them or even like them, but it is their choice.  The babies who end up in the dumpsters were thrown there because their mothers might not have even known they were pregnant to begin with.  Most of these kids do so because they fear their parents.  Who wouldn't?  But if their parents taught them about SEX to begin with they wouldn't be in this situation.  If they only took the time to talk to them the kids would know that mom & dad might not "kill" me so i might not have to throw my baby out with the trash.      Don't judge people because they choose to abort, if you don't like it then don't have one.  Juts make sure you educate your child about sex so they don't end up getting one or tossing their baby in the dumpster.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Whoa, did he really say that? Bad choice of words for sure. Don't they have people that read over something before the prez says it?    No loving mother in her right mind feels she's been punished by a baby|`|I8M5kw5Saa	To bad his mother didn't feel the same way about him.But really I don't believe in abortions for any reason and it definitely has no place in politics.Once again Obama putting his foot in his mouth.I just wish he would run the country and stop playing God....EDIT my God people have any of you people heard of ADOPTION, abortion isnt the only answer.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	if you dont want one dont have one..not everyone goes to an abortion clinic ..not everyone is on medicade ..certainly not the Obama's ..LOL|`|44OH7Si6aa	Um, yeah that sounds pretty bad, here is the rest of the statement though:  When it comes specifically to HIV/AIDS, the most important prevention is education, which should include -- which should include abstinence education and teaching the children -- teaching children, you know, that sex is not something casual. But it should also include -- it should also include other, you know, information about contraception because, look, I've got two daughters. 9 years old and 6 years old. I am going to teach them first of all about values and morals. But if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby. I don't want them punished with an STD at the age of 16. You know, so it doesn't make sense to not give them information."     I don't see the word abortion in there, you know what word i do see, CONTRACEPTION, you know it isn't just given in abortion form I hear they can give you pills or a patch or even little rings you stick up your vagina. Although I will say the statement was ill spoken, you are taking two separate speeches and putting them together in a different context. If we are going to do any Obama bashing can we please stay away from this grasping at straws crap?  Nice you tube clip, any clip that is a splicing together of multiple speeches has absolutely no credible value what-so-ever. Please use your brain and not propaganda.   Yes women use coat hangers to perform abortions themselves. No all states have laws that let you drop babies off anonymously. The only way to fight abortion is through contraception, education and support.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Honestly, I think abortion should be legal for the pure fact that it's an individuals right to decide.  On a personal level, I would never have an abortion.  It's not something I believe in for myself.   But, I am in no position to tell another women what to do with her body.   It's not my right and it's also not my right to preach to her about it.      In college, my roommate had an abortion. She never came out and fully said it, but she confessed it to me in a very underlying way.  Our other roommate was really cruel about it and said stuff behind her back, that was really mean and nasty.    But, honestly, I never said anything, because it wasn't my decision and it wasn't my life.  Lastly, it wasn't my body either.   She was a nice girl and I saw her in the week's leading up to the event and I saw the personality change and the mental reflection taking place inside of her.      I knew it had to be a tough decision.  But, did I have any right to butt my two sense in and preach my beliefs about it; NO.       I firmly believe that I can't make a decision for anyone outside of myself.  I also believe that no government officials have the right to do so either.    Again, abortion is not a decision I would make.  But, that doesn't mean, I don't support another women's right to choice.  I just can't tell someone else what's right for their life, their sanity and their body.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	People will say just about anything to get elected. Even by pretending to care about women's rights. I mean c'mon,he's a man. How much could he really care?|`|AA12016833	Gosh, this is one of those things that will forever be argued over. Personally, i believe abortions are cruel.Who are we to decided weather a child in the womb lives or dies?  But if I had a 13 or 14 year old daughter who got pregnant, I would be rushing her to an abortion clinic. So where does that put me?|`|OwK17Qo1aa	Punished meaning if any of his daughters were raped. I really don't understand why so many people make a huge deal about other people's decisions? Its not like they are gonna live with what they decided. A lot of people don't even know who or what a person went though, they judge their choice like they know whats best.|`|G4qP2gATaa	I think that we have more important things to worry about than what Obama said about abortions.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	OK, first off people, President Obama said this well over a year ago when he was running for the Democratic nomination that nobody thought he had a chance at getting. He then clarified what he said and stated very clearly that "punished" was the wrong word and he regretted saying it. He did not just say this last week from the Oval Office. Please check your facts.    As far as abortion goes, it is an intrinsically evil act regardless of who is getting the abortion, be it a 14-year-old in Tulsa or the President's daughter.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	He's pro choice. He believes women should have the right to choose. He's not forcing anyone to have an abortion. With him being president, no one has been forced to have an abortion. I think by his wife having 2 children already, he's not some "evil baby killer/abortion lover".    I don't think a baby is a punishment and I would never have an abortion myself. However, you can't stop the choice of what a woman wants to do. If you try to make abortion illegal, they will still find some way to get rid of their baby (Performing their own dangerous abortion, or abusing and murdering their child).|`|hl5WdXnbaa	you do not think many women use coat hangers?     I have been a social worker for the past 6 years, I have seen many , MANY women use coat hangers and other methods to terminate pregnancies. Abortion maybe legal but sometimes they still do no have the money for the procedure. Just 2 weeks ago a 42 year old woman died because she beat herself with a baseball bat trying to miscarry. It happens far more than I think you would like to believe.     I do not like abortion, but sadly it has become part of our world. Yes a baby can be punishment for some.... especially if that baby is the result of rape.    I respect your opinion and were you are coming from. ...but not everything is so black and white in this world... there are many shades of grey, yes even when it comes to abortion. I think if you were to do my job for a few months you  would understand that.     As far as the president goes, yes he is pro choice. But what I do not understand is why people are so hard on him about it...atleast we know were he stands..like it or not.  BUsh was pro life...and for the 8 years he was in office he did NOTHING to help prevent or stop abortions in the USA.  Doesn't that make him kinda worse? He had the power to do something and did nothing? If he is really anti abortion why not take a stand on it and stop it?     And if everyone is so pro life...why is there 2 million unwanted children in foster care? why won't people adopt them and give them homes? if we want abortions to stop we as a society need to put our money were our mouths are and look after the kids that are already here to. It seems like we want the babies to be born but don't really care what happens to them after that. Yes there are people lining up to adopt... adopt healthy white babies. The brown babies and the not so perfect babies get passed up every day.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	sadly i like him but not that part at all! a very good friend of mine had one when she was 15 or so No one helped her and she had abad family and her mom was abusive,   She a good person that had no understanding of this   now here is the story the boy that got her pregoo is now her hubby of like 20+ yrs they have had 5 more kids together all healthy .

Babies can be a "punishment" of sorts if you know that you really can't take care of it but are forced to anyhow.    Granted, there are alternatives to abortion, but do we really want to go back to the "wire hanger" days?    Also, some women are not capable of being "loving mothers". It would be more a punishment to the child to have to grow up with a parent who didn't want the child in the first place.|`|Vzf0Zp9Saa	I don't agree with the word punished, but it isn't right to punish a baby that might end up with parents who don't want it.  But that's what adoption is for.  Just think, if we made abortion illegal, we'd find a lot more babies dead in dumpsters.  And a lot of at risk pregnant women would die because they were forced to carry a baby their body could not handle.|`|AA11435607	getting abortion is a major sin !!|`|7PNbjit0aa	I don't think he's saying a baby is a punishment.  He is likely referring to the difficulty and ridicule SOME young women would face when dealing with an unexpected, unwanted pregnancy.    Why are people so against women having reproductive rights and choices?  He is not telling women to go and have an abortion, he is giving women a CHOICE and a RIGHT to their own body.|`|scBqngJ1aa	Abortion = Bad

PAjHWRhsaa	OMG! This is exactly me. I am 6 dpo and experiencing these exact same things. I also had the huge glob of EWCM. Which freaked me out a little because I have never experienced that. I also never have cramps like this before my period. And my breast while they don't hurt hurt they don't feel all that great either. They are heavy and when I touch them certain parts hurt. I hope this is our month!! (I'm 22 by the way). Good luck and lots and lots of baby dust to us! Glad to know I'm not the only one like this!    Oh, and the answer to your question, it very well could have been implantation. I experienced that same thing on 5 dpo. Just when I wiped, and never any other time.  From what I've read it can occur when you implant or sometimes it doesn't actually show up until your period is due to arrive, which I guess would be due to late implantation.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	Everyone is different but I do think that it would be too early to be having any symptoms of pregnancy..ie.."cravings"  All the other symptoms unfortunately also happen to be symptoms of ovulation, AF, and pregnancy.    If it is true implantation then you should get an accurate HPT in a few days.  But to prevent stress and taking too many test I would wait until your period is due.  Good luck and best wishes|`|ugIbLQdAaa	i dont know wt my case is .....i think i ovulated on 23rd or 24th of jan...bt on 9 dpo i had spotting,on 10 & 11dpo i had bleeding bt light(came only when i when to bathroom,had to keep a light pad for 2 days & had light cramps like as if its af ) & 12 dpo again spotting..bt all r red color only...bt this is too early for me to get af..its almost 9 days b4 my regular af...and i have no other signs also....will this be called implantation bleeding or periods...please advice..|`|CRVi3YsOaa	this boat is going to get full because i am in it too.  i am at 6 dpo with cramping and discharge, and like you my boobs are not sore, just kinda different. have not had any spotting but i am just waiting until the 14th so i can test, my husband is starting to ask if i am have tested yet, but i can't get it through his head that it is too early to test, because it would just be neg and i don't want to be disappointed.

And here I am now 10dpo and still having cramping on and off.  Like you they are like af cramps, only not as strong.  I am due for AF on 2/10 and like you don't want to test prior to missing af.  So, I guess we will both have to wait. There was another girl on here last week who had all the same symptoms and got her BFP at 9dpo.  As far as the possible implantation, it is definitely a possibility.

fZrA0O1eaa	she's not your kid if you've never stuck it inside of her. if she has a kid, that's her problem and you are not the father. change your perspective a bit and realize that the choice is her responsibility, especially if it really isn't her kid.  the thing is, have you stuck your penis inside her vagina? if yes, it might be yours. if no, then it isn't your kid and you shouldn't be involved.|`|MDSh3Auxaa	You better call Maury!!  Cause you are NOT the father!!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	It's her choice whether or not she wants to get an abortion and how dare you try to convince her.    I also think she cheated on you. It's very unlikely she got pregnant in the manner by which you say but if you came it could be possible.     Stop trying to convince her and demand a DNA test when the baby comes    Also, if you don't want the responsibility, you shouldn't be messing around.|`|5eMCaLcFaa	okay okay my fault for asking how to convince her i realized that after i wrote it out and read it but yeah thanks for all the advice imma mos deff use it. but yeah i believe she wuz mad cheating kause it just makes no sense otherwise. thanx|`|7f039e150427a004900f187f6f95464aaa	you can't convince her to get an abortion... & even if you could you wouldn't have too cause thats not your baby. If your penis never went inside of her vagina then you are not a daddy to be. I think your 15yr old girlfriend is just a lil skank|`|WiiFRW2caa	It is possible that you are the daddy if just one of those little guys was a good swimmer its possible it could have made not likley though so I would request NICELY that you want a dna test if its yours you dont want any hard feelings! Also If that story is true and she is pregnant by you thats like a maricle and that baby is meant to be here so don't try talk her out of having it and if it was a miracle then it wasn't you not your problem just think for a second how perfect every move would have had to be for her to pregnant like that!! That baby is special and meant to be here! And I f she does get an abortion at your request you will never know if it was yours and she will never forgive you If you care save that baby from death!    Ps  don't sign the birth certificate until you know for sure just trust me on that one it wont be pretty if you do and its not your kid lots of hassel for you!|`|2w7AlHcIaa	OK I'm going to have a totally different take then most of your other answers.   1. Its her right and her body  2. There is a really LOW chance that it could be yours. You didn't say and I don't want to know BUT if you came it could be yours. Sperm can be determined and yes they can in a rare moment make it through undies and into the right area at the right time.   3. I wouldn't jump to anything just yet, just relax. Stressing out is not going to help you or her.   4. If you think its not yours then get a paternity test after the baby is born.     The best advise I can give is relax. If you really did get unlucky then play the hand you are given.  I would for sure talk to your parents and See that little stick yourself.     Good Luck|`|P3e2kJtwaa	1: either one or both of your are lying or she's not pregnant.  2: it could have been a false positive  3: how dare you act like that? probably because you are a child! If she wants to keep the baby, she should be able to without problems from someone like you.  She is tooo young to care for a child right now, so why not think about adoption?  Abortion is not a good decision, she will regret it.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	do her parents know? Tell them !..On the phone ...an unlisted phone..lol|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You can't. It's her choice whether you like it or not. It's not even your kid,so stay out of it!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Okay if u never had sex (penis in vagina sex) the the baby is not yours. Dry humping will not get her pregnant. It's not your baby so don't worry about it. It is her problem now, not yours.|`|lzivF4Idaa	run the **** away dude. that baby isnt yours!|`|m1RTNmqsaa	You cannot convince her to get an abortion if thats not what shes willing to do. Its totally up to the mother what she wants to do in this situation, the father has no say what-so-ever.    However, if you've not actually had sex then she cannot be pregnant with your child it would have to be someone elses. If she ends up keeping it you should get a DNA test done just to know for sure tis not yours.|`|nMgsLNAAaa	she's a ****|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	You can not MAKE her do anything! Yes she is obviously cheating on you cuz there is no way that she could have gotten pregnant unless your penis came in contact with her vagina. But like I said it is her body, her rules, don't make her do anything. If she chooses not to get an abortion, well that's her decision.|`|S1uCC8eVaa	As for convincing her to get a abortion, you can't..It's up to her, But what you can do it tell your parents and decide if adoption is the best idea. Having a baby at such a young is scary and it's not easy. As i was pregnant at 19. a few years older but still it's hard. But this is something you two need to talk about and i would even talk to your parents. There is a good chance she could have got pregnant by what you guys were doing, So don't blow it off that it's not yours it could be...So really the only thing you can do now is wait. it sucks but it's true. I hope the best for the two of you...    Best Wishes **|`|7yRGUtgMaa	It's not possible that it's yours  If you really love her stay with her through this.   Help her, love her, she doesn't want to kill the life that is now growing inside of her. Her Choice. She really needs someone right now to be pregnant at 15/16. By telling her to get an abortion is just your downfall.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	People really need to grow up. Commenting this question saying she is a ****. That is real imature.    1. She really isnt pregnant and the test is false.  2. She cheated on you.  3. You could have cumed by her opening and the sperm could have moved down.     and im really glad she is deciding to have the baby. I mean why kill an innocent little baby. Everything happens for a reason. I wish you guys the best of luck. I hope you stay with her. and you need to care for her and respect what she chooses to do with the baby. and go see a doctor as soon as possible. to see if she really is pregnant and to get her healthy to have this baby!|`|RPc63EK2aa	If she really pregnant pls dont let her abort the baby, dont tell her to abort the baby, it's a BIG sin. The baby dont know about this, why the baby needs to suffer because of you guys. why he/she has to die becasue you are afraid? Let her take care the baby in her womb, then later when she gave birth... you can make a test, to find out whether it is yours or not.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	you can't make her get an abortion, it's all up to her. but honestly i would leave her because she had to have cheated on you...she's not the next virgin mary!!|`|KjkDeFbeaa	If you are serious and think that you could possibly be the father your parents need to be  a little  more actively involved in your upbringing!! then again if you are fourteen and still not smart enough to put a raincoat on befor jumping in puddles,( a condom!! )then you are in for a Very hard life!    DUDE THERE IS NO WAY THE CHILD IS YOURS IF SHE IS PREGNANT!!  HAS SHE GONE TO A DOCTOR TO FIND OUT FOR SURE??????       Please do yourself and any unborn children a favor and put a condom on. You are both still very obviously children yourselves! DO NOT BRING ANYMORE INTO THE WOLD UNTIL YOU ARE 1) ALOT MORE GROWN UP AND 2) YOU HAVE REALIZED YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO (MAKE) ANYONE DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|EMiekqB2aa	wait it out the get a test to see if the Baby yours and there is always adoption.|`|2qpBBTakaa	First, I would make sure she is really pregnant.  Second, make sure it is really yours.  Third, tell your parents, both sets.    You can't force her to get an abortion and I don't think she could get one without parental consent anyway.  Check planned parenthood.|`|BNLVl0Jpaa	Well, to sum it up. You said she took a pregnancy test and it came up positive. Well if you never actually saw the positive result on the test she is lying to you about being pregnant. If she told you shortly after you did stuff her period is late and she might be pregnant she is not telling you the truth. Because you ovulate shortly after your period (making it possible to get pregnant). SHE ISN'T PREGNANT! And the odds of getting pregnant from dry humping is about the same as winning to lottery. Trust me she is lying.|`|wyiKkiiiaa	Definitely watch out for this girl. I know you care a lot for her, but the baby just isn't yours, judging from what you guys have been doing. Do not take responsibility for this baby, and don't let her make you.|`|1Ox4l5nnaa	either she's cheating.....(sex101).....sperm has to enter her vag to get her pregnant!!!!!  and if she didn't cheat, then she is the next virgin mary      if she aborts jesus 2 or the jewish messiah then you are going to get pinneapple up your *** everyday for the rest of eternity|`|XUBzBSk9aa	OK you Know it's not yours, there's no way to get pregnant like that. First she should go to the doc to be 100% sure she is. If so and if you really love her you should help her under stand it will be ok and theres so many people that would love to have a baby and can't. So talk to her about adoption there so many places that will help her out please don't kill a baby that could grow up to be a doctor or an inventor of something amazing|`|02CeuJtCaa	its probably not yours if its just dry humping.  but you should talk to her about it.  if she's refusing to get an abortion, thats her choice and her problem to keep the child.  maybe cuz its not yours so she doens't want to let you plan the life or her child.
2irmTjQ3aa	Yes u should because there is a high chance u r pregnant, even if he does not finish inside u, i know way too many people who have gotten pregnant that way.|`|0UOHex1Maa	It sounds like you could have gained the Freshman 15. (I hate it!) But the only way you're going to know is through a Pregnancy test. It'll most definitely show if you're pregnant or not by now!  But, if you're not having any signs (other than weight gain) of being pregnant, and you had sex 3 months ago, I'd say it's definitely just the F-15. :)  Best of luck, hun!*|`|gyoylefvaa	yes. eat less.  and your pregnant maybe 2 months and 2 weeks.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Have you missed a period? If you have then you should really take a pregnancy test, it's the only way to know. Good luck|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	You need to take a pregnancy test and see.I got Pregnant at 15.I only had sex once with my Boyfriend at the time and bam,I was expecting.My Son is Now 23 yrs old.If you have any questions or just want to chat feel free to Email me.|`|d67ULZQ6aa	You possibly could be. No one on yahoo knows though. Just take a prenancy test.|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	If you're worried you might be pregnant, take a hpt. Even if he didn't finish inside of you there is always a pre-ejaculation that could get you pregnant as well.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	The only thing you can do is to take a pregnancy test or go to your doctor for blood work..|`|1audzkx6aa	Take a pregnancy test, and grow up. Havent you heard of pre-***?|`|R31uLQvTaa	Don't be worried. Be correct! Take a pregnancy test. Some people notice their symptoms and lucky ones do not. So you might be pregnant. Rather he finished or not. All it takes is a little leak and you could get pregnant. Good Luck!!|`|UXoTCL98aa	why havent u tested yet? just test urself especially if its not normal for you to be this late|`|zcujH5XDaa	Wow if it has been since november and you havent had your period you just need to go to the doctor and get a blood test and a vaginal exam, cuz sweetie it sounds to me like ur prego!!! Good luck i am 16 and 30 weeks 6 days pregnant with my lil girl so i know how it feels to have to tell ur parents!!
2HETgiwgaa	You can get treatment for it apparently - see the links below.  I've taken this quote from the americanpregnancy.org site:    "Can a tipped uterus prevent pregnancy?    Typically a tipped uterus is only thought to be the cause of infertility after all other possible reasons for fertility problems have been ruled out. Your doctor might recommend a uterine suspension or UPLIFT procedure if there is no other explanation for your fertility problems. However, this is not common."    Try not to worry hun - apparently I have a tilted uterus (at least the nurse mentioned it during an internal last year, only because she was having trouble reaching my cervix) - and I had my son without knowing anything about it - keep talking to your doctor if you're still concerned, but after reading up on it, it seems unlikely that it will cause you any more problems.  BABY DUST
OoHN2qjDaa	I don't like either ... they're too common. I'm not saying call your kids something batshit like Alianaiaiaaaia and Germae or whatever people come up with nowadays ... I 'm just saying call them something different than every other child|`|9kdUmttPaa	I LOVE Hannah. Not sure about Raleigh, though. I have always liked Skyler but, think it suits a girl better. Not fond of Jack, either. I always think they forgot the rest of the name.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I'm not a fan of Hannah, but Raleigh is different and I never heard it before as a mn.  Like it very much.  Like the boy's name too.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	Hannah is way too common.  Skyler is a girl's name.  It's my daughter's name.  There is nothing masculine about the word Sky.  Sorry.  I know many people think it is, but in my opinion it is just strange.  Funny it started out as a strictly male name, isn't it?|`|X14EmlrXaa	I love Hannah! And Raleigh goes so great with it! I love that name!  My Opinion on Hannah Raleigh: I love it! I think it is so cute!    Skyler, omg i am pregnant and i have said, if it is a boy i think i might wanht to name it skyler, but eveyones like, that is a girls name  I LOVE IT FOR A BOY! and Jack, so simple but so solid! IT ROCKS!    My opinion on Skyler Jack: 2 words, SUPER AWESOME|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I love the name Jack, it's very solid and masculine. Skyler however sounds like a girls name. Feminine names for girls and masculine for boys sound best.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	For a girl Hannah is fine.    For a boy I like Jack Raleigh.|`|QONFn7vXaa	Love the Girl Name! Boy name... love the first name just doesn't sound right with the middle of Jack. But I think boy names are really hard! Congrats.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	I love the little girl name but not the boys name. I think both Skylar and Jack are strong names and think they should be used as first names not first and middle. I would look for different middle names for both Skylar and Jack.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Hannah Raleigh is awesome. Skyler is really cool, but Jack isnt so great with it. what about Skyler Zane, Skyler Jace, Skyler James, or Skyler Martin.|`|HFhZc7BAaa	Raleigh..pronounced like the city in NC?  If so, I actually really like that name...more than Hannah actually, although I do think Hannah is a pretty name.       Not a huge fan of Skyler...it's cute for a little boy, but I can't picture a grown man with that name.  I do think Jack goes well with it though.    Good luck!|`|UbNOv4a1aa	i absolutely love the baby girl name ! .... but quite honestly i dont like skyler for a boy... Skye is great for a boy and really cute but Skylar is feminine in my mind.|`|8nNF3t65aa	I like Hannah Raleigh, but Skyler sounds too feminine to me. Maybe Jack Skyler?|`|a1f5adfa819999f0dfc90cf84449307caa	If there's one more Skyler in this world I think I'll shoot myself.  I know of at least 4 kids under the age of 4 with that name.....too too common these days.|`|9NJlG8hvaa	I like both choices very much!|`|9IOsFjX9aa	Those are beautiful names..go for it!|`|rbkikcdYaa	hey there.    i like the name you have chosen for a girl  but as for the boy name im not a huge fan of Skylar. In ny personal opinion I think its more of a girls name ( im not into skye, skylar any kind of sky for any child really )    Each to their own.  You should name you child whatever you want.|`|onU5yDSGaa	those sound like could names to me.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	I love both names, but a simple suggestion to be different is: Skyler Jackson instead of Jack? Congrats!|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	How Are you going to pronounce Raleigh?  (Ray-leigh)  (Ra-Lee)    Anyways I LOOOOVE the girls name!
fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	Never heard of this before I am on my fifth and im sure if I have one more the government doesn't have the money to give me a grant, for what?|`|cJfJd9yaaa	In Australia, we get a $5,000 baby bonus for each child that we have. The couple must have a combined income under $150,000.  We also get a "multiple birth" payment or grant if three or more children are born from one pregnancy.  There is also family assistance payment and tax discounts when you have children.  Im assuming you are in the USA??|`|7xit1ogxaa	No, that is not true. You are on welfare if you can't support yourself and your family. They don't hand out grants just because you have had a certain amount of children.

rHufcHwHaa	I was born with a head full of black hair and it all fell out by the time i was 3 months old.  It grew back before I was one, though and it was really light blonde.  this happened to both of my brothers and several of my cousins as well.  i think it's pretty common.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's due to hormones and it happens to a lot of babies- my son had a head full of black hair, it all fell out by about 3 months and grew in blond and curly|`|zmbeIbx7aa	yes some babies loose there hair after birth and some up to six months after birth.So it is normal and she may loose more.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	A lot of babies will loose all their hair and it will grow back a different color.      Thats why you can't truly tell a babies hair color until at least a year.|`|PymLdXM8aa	When my daughter was born with a good amount of hair everyone said that she would loose most of it... she never did it just keeps growing, but yes it is common i guess? lol|`|aCePLit5aa	I think it may also be because babies head circumference grows, which disperses the hair, making it appear like it's thinning out also!
iXQYd0Cmaa	The same thing happened to me I wasn't dilated and my baby hadn't dropped until I was in the later stages of labor ( at 41 and a half weeks) they were going to induce me but I was in early labor for two days and ended up going into full on labor as soon as I got to the hospital, they also did the ultrasound on me to see how much fluid was in there and made sure my baby was ok, don't worry about it I'm sure everything is fine!!   Good Luck!! I would suggest getting as much sleep as you can now! I didnt listen when everyone said that to me and I am regretting it now!  If you have any questions or just want to talk you can email me :)|`|MqFeJiukaa	Dont get discouraged.  Millions of women go into labor with out dilating and dropping before hand.  I was checked at 31 weeks and was 2cm dilated and still very much pregnant.  I was checked Tues and 3cm and still pregnant.  So being dilated don't mean you will go into labor any faster.  I also have an u/s Mon to see if I need to be induced because I have been measuring so large the whole pregnancy and they think my due date could be off (long story but no lmp).  Just keep walking and try not to stress about it.  She just may not be ready to come out yet and you will find out next week.  Good Luck!|`|FufV5aZNaa	Something to consider is that when Dr.s estimate your due date they go by your last period date. This formula also assumes you have a normal 14 day luetal phase. If your cycles are different you could be up to a week farther or behind what they suspect you are.    I wouldn't worry yet. Wait and see how the levels look and go from there.|`|AA11027121	I would say she is not ready yet.  The doctor will determine the best for her and whether you need to go into labor.  They say it is normal to go up to 42 weeks.  I am just at 37 weeks myself and would love to go any day now but I have a feeling I will be near that 42 week mark.  I know what you feel though like the end is never going to come.  I do not think I could do up to another 5 weeks because this just takes forever!!
9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Yes they can! My son has done this probably 15 or more times in his 6 months here on Earth!|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	My 4 month old daughter moans in her sleep when she is sick, like she is now. She laughs in her sleep ALL the time...it's hilarious lol. Every once in a while she'll cry a little so I'm sure they have nightmare. I wonder what about though...all the formula in the world disappearing?|`|VzOokYEqaa	my daughter does that sometimes i just rub her leg or pat her butt then she is fine. she also laughs in her sleep, it really is the cutest thing.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	my son does the same thing... its to sad to watch so i wake him up just so he knows that its just a bad dream, the look on his little face is so sad... it is also a cry like no other its not loud its just really high pitched.     nightmares suck, poor lil things|`|PymLdXM8aa	my 7 ( almost 8) mth old daughter has done this many times since she was born and i was told that it was probably because of gas bubbles coming up into the esophagus. I do know that that is true because i have picked her up a couple times when this has happened and she burped... BUT    within the last couple of months i have been holding her while shes been passed out and was giggleing in her sleep! And then whenever I would laugh, she would laugh... it was so cute! You cant blame that on gas!|`|nnBAnBOlaa	This is common in infants.  We do not know for sure.  Gas is a popular guess.  It could be a brief bad dream.  A brief pain.      I am an RN.  I have done lots of pediatrics.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	of course; if they can dream, they can be good ones or bad ones...
76cAAPfBaa	That's too important to just guess at! You are talking about a life here. Contact your doctor NOW, and ask him if you should come in and get checked out! Don't wait until something worse might happen...|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	yes its so normal,don't forget your body is getting ready to carry a baby it has alot of growing to do,which means strecthing and pressure,that's what your feeling now. x|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I had sharp pains like that when i had a miscarriage at 5 weeks a year ago.  if you see any blood go straight to hospital. Good luck!|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I just had a miscarriage and that is how it started out, I hope it is better luck for you. But I also know that sometimes you have pains during early pregnancy due to everything preparing to carry the baby. I would call the doctor and have them check your hormone levels.|`|HxGh2oKfaa	I'm 5 weeks prego and I get them every now and then too, when I stand up fast or cough hard. It's normal, my doc said its just my uterus expanding!|`|Sj32KRFaaa	I had this same pain and got really scared.  They did an ultrasound to make sure it wasn't eptomic and all was ok.  Turns out it was just growing pains.  Good luck!
prqrQcd1aa	I get child support in PA too. It takes about 7 to 10 days to get the card. Once they recieve the payment it can take up to 3 days to get on to your card. I usually get mine on my card the day after the main place gets it, i can give you a web site that will give you all this info!     www.childsupport.state.pa.us|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Well it all depends on if he pays it or not. But usually after he pays the first payment it will take about a month for you to get it. I get sent a check but now I can get in put directly in my checking account. They sent me a paper in the mail asking if I wanted it to go directly in there.|`|0gFdt7VUaa	Im not sure how it works in PA but Im in neighboring Mahoning county, in Ohio and my child support hearing was on December 18,2008 and I have not gotten my child support card yet! I called and they told me that because it was a private matter it may take longer.( we had attorneys. Not through welfare or child support ) but I have not even gotten my child support order yet. Which means he hasn't made a payment. Im wondering who's side they are really on. The children's or the absent parent.  Good luck to you. I hope PA is better than OH.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If he actually pays, you would probably start receiving the payments about a week after he makes the payment.  You should have asked for a wage garnishment, that way you don't have to worry if he'll actually send the payment in.
rmse6Mj8aa	you could test i suppose.. how late is your period?  if it is late then you could take a sensitive hpt with fmu... or wait it out another week?  might be best to see your Dr and get a blood test?  best of luck
MzMQ6IFaaa	Do not give up hope! June 2008 I became pregnant for the first time in my life and I'm only 24. That pregnancy was ectopic and found too late and I had to have my left fallopian tube removed. My doctor advised me to wait 3 months to try again. To be honest ,my partner and I just kept trying right away. 4 months later I went to Er thinking I had a UTI because of frequent urination I was instead told I was 4-5 weeks pregnant. A week later a transvaginal ultrasound confirmed it was in the uterus!! I am now 5 months pregnant and absolutely no problems. It definitely depends on your fertility and positively the condition of your tubes or in my case, the remaining tube. I definitely would recommend taking the proper healing time advised by your physician for your own physical and mental health. Going through an ectopic pregnancy or any kind of loss is a very hard and traumatic thing and you need time to heal on all fronts, but if its meant to be its meant to be! Good luck to you!|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	It all depends on the person. Sometimes people get pregnant right after sometimes it takes time. I had a miscarriage and my doctor told me to wait 2-3 months. We are trying again this month after my 4th cycle. Good luck.|`|jlIr1Lbraa	I know EXACTLY what your going through!!!  I'm 27 and I found out I was pregnant 3 weeks ago now and it was a SURPRISE!!!  I have a IUD in place when I got pregnant I just happend to think "Hmmm maybe I should take a test" so I did and to my shock I was pregnant...  I knew nothing good could come of this pregnancy...  I had just had my youngest daughter June 04, 08 and before her I had my older daughter June 16, 07 so I figured as fertile as I am maybe I should get a IUD so I don't keep getting pregnant as it was before my daughters I have a 9yr son and wasn't ready for anymore.  So there was no problem me getting pregnant.  The only thing that clued me into taking a test was I had a couple small clots and I never have clots on my period and sense I had my IUD inserted in July 08 I've had consistent periods and so I don't know what on earth made me decide to take a test beside the small clots but it was a wise choice that I did, Once I saw the + on the test I knew that meant trouble.  So I called my Ob and asked her what to do she said " GO TO THE ER NOW!!"  So thats what I did coz we knew the possibilty that its ECTOPIC and so I got to the ER and they did blood test and confirmed yes indeed I was pregnant 4-5weeks along.  Then they did a pelvic exam and called in a ultrasound tech at 1:00am to do an ultrasound and really couldn't see anything..  So they said it might be just to early to see anything or maybe a start of a Ectopic and so I was sent home and went back to my doc and did another HCG and my level was going down so I figured "thats good" that it isn't ectopic or so I thought.  Reguarless the IUD had to come out and it had moved behind my cervix and so my doc couldn't just go in and get it vaginally.  So she set me up the next week for surgery to remove the IUD on Jan. 29, 09 (last week) and when she was doing the surgery I indeed was pregnant with an Ectopic.  The day prior to the surgery my doc was saying " We may never know where the pregnancy was" coz the ultraosund machine never picked it up only the IUD they had saw moved and thats how I was pregnant.        I've never had a problem with any pregnancy and my doc said it was all due to it being Ectopic coz of the IUD other wise should of been a healthy pregnancy.  So needless to say I was a lil upset that I lost the pregnancy coz of the IUD that was suppose to make it so I didn't get pregnant, but the way I look at it if I'm gonna be pregnant let it be a good pregnancy not ectopic.  I love all my kids,  So when I came out of the anesthesia I was told it was indeed Ectopic pregnancy and that she had to remove my right tube.  I was devestated that I lost my tube but still had my left tube and both ovarires so I was thankful for that but to find out the tube was READY to BURST at anytime so I got lucky she did the surgery when she did to remove the IUD and found out where the pregnancy was.  Sense this has happend me and my husband decided that we do want one more child.  And so hopefully I'll be able to give you an answer to your question very soon with how fertile I am lol.  I've done searching myself trying to find the same answer coz I too want to get pregnant ASAP .  They say to wait 3 months but thats becoz they don't think your emonitally ready not becoz of your body isn't ready.  Once you ovulate your body is ready.  Same with just having a baby.  I found out when my oldest daughter was 2 mos old I was pregnant again with my youngest daughter so thats bull.  I had no problems with any of my pregnancy's.  This was actually my 6th pregnancy prior I had 3 children and 2 miscarriages and this ectopic.  So there is hope that it will pay off for both of us soon,,,,,,  I'm not sure and don't think its possible but I'm feeling signs of pregnancy already and this is how I've found out everytime I've ever been pregnant but I test won't tell for 2 weeks from now if I am or not.  Most I can say is if I never taken that test most likely I would of hemmroaged to death and would of never known I was pregnant coz I thougt I was safe with the IUD and consistent periods sense the IUD was placed before I had normal periods...  I'm soooo sorrry for your loss i know how it feels.  Everyone calls it a embryo but it was a baby I don't care what they call it...  It hurts but it will ease over time.  If your ready to try again do it! Don't wait for your doc's ok..  You know when your ready.  *SENDING BABY DUST YOUR WAY*.....  I'll keep you informed.  Hopefully you will get pregnant again soon. ANd be in the right place...
Rzsudrzqaa	yeah... at four months she's at the babbling stage... ma ma da da ba ba.... etc..   they don't know what they're saying but it melts your heart when you hear a ma ma or a da da lol.    As far as actual first words... it varies... the average for my kids was between 9-12 months... at least words they use and understand the meaning of. BUT... a couple of mine were practically mute for a good long while lol.|`|AA10186411	I don't consider it a first word until they are linking to word to something or someone.  My daughter said mama at 10 months, and associated it with me.  She said dada at about 4 months as well, but she would just yell out the syllables, not linking it to a person.  I know this because her dad isn't around, so she wouldn't be calling anyone that.  She also knew the syllables baba and nana but also didn't associate those with anything.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	My baby was fluent in two languages by that age.    PS Trinity is an awful name.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	MY SON IS 4 MONTHS NOW AND ALL HE SAYS IS DA DA AND MA IT IS VERY CUTE|`|W1JSp0blaa	4-5 months|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	Trinity is a beautiful name. Since I'm not a mother I don't know how it feels to hear your child say their first word, but it must be an amazing feeling.|`|5b21e8a85edaf6c3aa18dba3f2d440c0aa	my twin girls were 5 and a half months.|`|fqTQrmv4aa	Trinity is a Lovely Name.    She is doing well, you are a good parent and you should keep up the hard work!    Babies can speak at their own pace, but it sounds like Trinity is doing well!
DDFSITiYaa	I have found that MAKING them share just makes them more resistant to sharing in the future.  Overriding her decision to not share something that is hers just creates resentment.  It is not really about the hat, it is about having something that your sibling wants.  She is testing you to see if you value  the 3 yo more than her.     Here's what has worked for me; I will talk to the older child and say, 'you don't have to lend your sister your hat if you don't want to.  I would like you to because it is just a hat and your sis really loves it and wants to wear it and show it off because it belongs to you.'  If that doesn't start a conversation or if she still refuses, say ' well, that's ok, but what do you think would be a fair way to for your sis to borrow it?  Is there something we can work out?"  Examples would be if the older one gets something for lending the hat - 15 minute later bedtime, extra tv time, if the 3 yr old has something to lend the older, etc.      7 year olds are notorious for the 'what's in it for me' mindset.  By allowing a negotiation you give them a perpective of getting something by being open to negotiate.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Perhaps you should buy your preschooler her own hat? Then they won't have anything to argue over. Don't make her share-sometimes children just want to have something that is totally theirs, especially when they have younger siblings! My older 2 children often share their things, but they have the odd 'special' toy that is theirs and theirs alone. They don't get shared.    Maybe this hat should be your older daughters special thing?|`|Rzsudrzqaa	Yes a 7 year old should share BUT... she does need her special things that are only hers. My seven year old keeps all of his "hands off" toys and things in his underwear drawer. He's really good at sharing but they do need things that are theirs alone.    Also... I never make them share brand new toys. I'm also thinking of getting them those kids lockers so they can tuck their favorite things away without worrying about their siblings getting into their things.     Best of luck and a happy family.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Make her share the hat!|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	Yes, she does have a right to say no, but if you try a little bit of convincing it might help. Or you can just buy your7 year old her own hat.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Explain to your 7 year old how much her sister looks up to her and that it would mean a lot to her if she could wear the hat.  Then ask your 7 year old to pick out something of her little sister's that she'd like to play with and they can trade for the day.    My sister and are 4 years apart (almost 24 and 20 now, yikes!) and this always worked.  What does not work is "7 year old share. 3 year old, you get everything you want because you're the cute little baby."  Trust me!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I tell my oldest that he has every right to keep some of his things as only his.. however; i remind him that how he treats his little brother is how he's teaching his little brother to treat him.  that usually is enough for him to share things like a hat that might not mean much to him.  he still puts his favorite toys in his room and i respect that.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I would make her share the hat. In my house the gals can choose 1 toy that they do not have to share. Everything else is fair game.
Ra8cdjbDaa	Sounds like you have a very good chance of being pregnant.

Good luck|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Um yeah that's not normal.  You should call your doctor asap.  Or you could just have a bruise?  Or your baby could just have his elbow or foot stuck in that position.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	I THINK THAT IS WHY OR THE BABY JUST KICKS THERE A LOT|`|AA10781522	I never experienced anything that that with either of my kids. I have 2. I would definately discuss this with your doctor. You could be sleeping wrong at night, favoring your right side when you sleep. The baby could also be favoring that side. CALL YOUR DOCTOR. IT COULD BE YOUR APPENDIX giving you problems. Or even a kidney stone. Sweet heart defianately get that checked!!|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i too really think you should call your doctor to be on the safe side..  hope there's nothing to worry & things go well on your side..    keep us posted..    hope i have helped..!!
9OsjdsrZaa	This is a tough one, because babies can be so particular.    My children each started with carrots, sweet potatoes and squash.  Their textures are about the same, and they are inherently sweeter than some of your starches, like peas and corn.      A lot of people say to start with the sweet, because kids will accept it better, while others say...jump to the bland flavors so they won't get stuck on sweet.  I honestly believe either method is fine.  With 4 kids, I have found that they have each liked something different, and their likes have always flip flopped.      Try a variety of things, and see what it is they gravitate to.  (Easier said then done, when you end up having 20 different jars of baby food in the frig at one time...that your little one has completely rejected.)    I ended up buying frozen veggies that I would cook and serve on my own.  It is not as healthy as fresh, but better than most canned.  You can cook up just what you need and leave the rest for another feeding.    Good Luck!  It is never easy trying to second guess what your baby will want.  All I can say is persistence is the key.  Try it again and again.  One day, they just might surprise you!|`|RIbS6yzYaa	my daughter loved avocado, pear, apple, banana, sweet potato, regular potato, broccoli.  i would either give ripp pear, the whole thing, peeled the top 2" and gave it to my daughter who gummed it right up, didnt choke, the avacardo was lightly mashed with some breastmilk added, same with the potatoes.  soon she was eating chunks and loving it.  she is 16 month old now and eats teh exact same as everyone else does.|`|Hw2IYwEpaa	my sister loved sweet potatoes.|`|qpOq3jSVaa	my babies favorite was carrots.. but she also liked squash, and brocoli and cheese blend.  and def sweet potatos. they are everyone's favorite!!!|`|Y4EEgkCraa	well i started my little one with carrots,butternut squash and courgettes. obviously one at a time!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Whatever you want to offer and baby enjoys.

Anything with a skin to be avoided unless you peel it, Broad Beans for example, peel half a dozen for nipper but you eat yours with skin.

And the nice thing about them- (like most baby foods) they're super easy to make homeade at home- just bake and puree with a little water!  It's the first food my son ate the fromthe adult table.    For green veggies- use frozen, not canned/Gerber jarred.  They are tastier- and babies have a tendancy to not enjoy the green stuff as much.

I am just playin u shud report him rite away forreal because that is just sick he mite be doin it to other young girls that mite be younger than you so report him to an adult you trust. or tell me his name and what high school you go to and i will contact the right people.|`|AA12115728	Whoa - inappropriate behavior.    When I was 12, my math teacher came to my desk to help me with something.  Being the smart *** I was at that time, I pretended to fall asleep at my desk while he was talking. He stopped talking, but didn't go away.  Right there, where 30 other kids could have seen him, he stroked my cheek  I immediately "pretended" to wake up.  "What were you saying, Mr. G? I must have dozed off..."    Back in those days, probably not enough would have been done about it if I had reported it.  I was afraid that I would be blamed for what HE did!  So I handled it myself. That's the way things used to be done.    Nowadays, you don't have to accept or deal with this kind of inappropriate behavior.  There is never any situation in which it is okay to kiss a student.  You need to tell someone, and not feel guilty about it at all.  Until something is done about this, don't be alone with this teacher.  Even if you are not alone, put yourself as far away from him as possible.  If he approaches you, run away.|`|kdgdwERaaa	Lies|`|lix7lvwhaa	uhm jim d you are a retard..the person who asked this question is a girl.  and who cares whether the teacher is hot or not that's the least of her worries. and hun you need to report this teacher asap to the police or tell your parents and they can report it. you are way too young..and just thinking about that is just grotesque. he's most likely married and older and well that just calls for two things: he's a perv and a predator.  you need to report that guy pronto.  i hope you're okay otherwise :D|`|5wt0En1Zaa	Report him.  This is illegal and he will be punished.  Do you really love him?|`|5KYY9z7Jaa	Tell your mum or dad or anyone you trust,  Teachers are NOT allowed to do this.|`|iLIsQgIUaa	TELL YOUR mum and dad as it is inapproieate and she shouldn't be doing that.
Ot8lxaMEaa	Congrats on the poop training! No more poopy diapers atleast. As for the peeing, ditch the pull ups and have him go naked for a few days or just in sweatpants. The naked drill is best done outside (in case of accidents) or on hard surface floors. This forces the child to be aware of his body, and will start to pay attention to when he as to go. If he is in pullups, he can pee and not really even notice. If he is in clothes, he will get all wet, and he will have to change his clothes(having him do this by himself will help him learn consequences). Good luck and rememer lots of praise when he gets it right!|`|evnLjcnxaa	Okay I know this is going to sound so like "backwoods" but this is how the boys in my husbands family were peepee trained. Take them outside and instruct them to pee, they will like the idea of being outside because it's manly then when they get that down add the potty chair to the mix. Sounds so incredibly ignorant I know but it works. HTH|`|vue9NOhYaa	Relax.  THis is the beginning of February.  September is  7 months away.  That's a HUGE amount of time in the life of a toddler.  When kids are ready to potty train, they do it quickly. (A few days to a week.) So no pressure. Wait for him to show signs of being ready. Or wait until summer and do naked training.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	first of all don't focus on the way he pees.If he feels more comfortable sitting let him do it...there'll be time to teach him how to do it while standing later  .You should always congratulate him when he manages to go to the potty and look really happy.That will encourage him to do it more often. Why don't you put his potty in the room that he spends more of his time so that he can go by his own every time he feels to?You should know that potty training is something that needs time and patience from you.Don't get angry or frustrated if he pees elsewhere...just say "it's ok baby.Next time tell mommy to take you to the potty!"  good luck|`|Hi5h9739aa	You can always do the cheerios or fruit loops in the toliet and have him shoot them.
AA10120592	my daughter started preschool as soon as she turned 3. she already knew her abc's and how to count to ten and all the shapes, but its still great for them to be social and all that. she only goes four days a week, for 3 hours. she loves it.|`|NqEZ120iaa	Definitely, pre school isn't only about learning stuff, but also socializing, and he needs an all-round education.    Have fun with the stories he will come home with and enjoy the time to yourself.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	At our preschool, they have the same cut off date as the regular school. So now is the perfect time to send him. My son has a late birthday, so he began school at 2 3/4 and didn't turn 3 until later that fall. He's now in his third year and loves it and it's been great. It sounds like he's right on target, and they will work on all that stuff with him when he gets to school.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	The only way you can know if it is too early is to go ahead and send him. I sent my oldest son to preschool a little early and at the end of the school year, his teachers told me that while he was intellectually ready, he was still too emotionally immature. So he attended preschool for another year before moving on to kindergarten. That time, he did fine. I didnt feel like it was any big deal he got held back that young. By the way he is 12 now, and does great. It sounds like your Son is ahead of the curve so it will probably work out.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Go ahead and send him.  Most kids there probably won't know that stuff as ABC's and counting are common things taught at preschool.|`|rISHTfK3aa	It's never to early. What you son lacks in development the Pre-school will develop themselves.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Preschool is more concerned about your child's emotional readiness when being in a group of others, and his ability to potty on his own.    If your child plays often in supervised play with other children, he may be getting the practice he needs at home.    As a very wise teacher explains it  "the work of a child is play"    123's and abc's won't get him near as far at this age as his social skills and emotional well being.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Not too early. That is the normal age to start preschool. Is he potty trained? That is generally the only requirement.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	try it, why not.  Worse case scenario, he's not ready and you have to pull him out.  He'll most likely be fine.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	It not too early if you will send him in play school where they will play at the same time they will learn, it is better for their learning as he will be with other kids.|`|ftbrRTYUaa	I sent my daughter to preschool when she was 3. She went until she was 5 and I could put her into kindergarten. She loved it. she learned so much. Now a days they want kids to know so much before they get into kindergarten its scary. By the time she was in kindergarten she was already for the for what the teacher had to teach them.     Now she is in first grade and doing great.
fPX1lD8uaa	My feet swell as well, and I put them on top of the computer tower that is on the floor under my desk to elevate them just a little... It helps a little...     Pillow, pj's, robe, clothes to go home in, sneakers, socks, bras, undies, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, brush, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, make-up, scrunchies (hair ties), camera & cell phone (charger too just in case).  I really don't think I had much else.  Someone brought me the outfit for the baby to come home in... and the hospital I believe had everything else I needed.  : )|`|7uVlYPEIaa	Deoderant, change of clothes, slippers, anything you want specifically, either brand name or something the hospital doesn't provide. Tooth paste, shampoo (my hosptial didn't provide it) Anything for the baby that you want to use that the hospital doesn't provide, like if you want to use cloth diapers or the organic ones. Most hospitals use pampers. Your own breast pump if you have one and want the lactation consultant to help you use yours, not the hospitals. Clothes for the baby's first picture and to come home in along with blankets and such. Mittens for the hands so the baby doesn't scratch themself.     As for the swelling, at times you just have to deal with it. I carried my twin girls till 38 weeks and from 25 weeks on I couldn't fit into any of my shoes except my flip flops, and by 32 weeks even they were tight. It didn't matter how much I drank water or put my feet up. That being said, drink plenty of water. Get a small foot stool or such and place under your desk to elevate your feet, if even by only 8 to 10 inches. When you get home, just relax, let someone else do the cleaning and such, plop down on the couch and put a pillow under your legs. Also try sleeping with your legs slightly elevated.|`|Rsq1G60zaa	I actually just had a doctor appointment today.  I am flying in a few weeks and to prevent or help the swelling the doctor prescribed me a pair of compression stockings.  I would ask your doctor about those.  Good luck:-)|`|NI8D46J0aa	I always swell sooo bad at the end. I can't even wear my normal shoes usually. I had to wear flip flops to church. lol. I always drink lots of water, that seems to help and rest when you can. It will be over soon.     IN your bag:  nightgowns, roomy clothes, socks, grooming supplies, going home outfit for baby, magazines or books for after, should be enough. They supply diapers, but I usually take a few anyways.     Good luck and congrats on the baby.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I never had swelling with any of my pregnancies that was bad so I don't have any experience with that. I hope you can find something that works for you at work.    As far as the bag goes, you can never over pack those things in my opinion. If you think you need it then take it. It's better to have more than you need than not enough. Besides, whatever you don't need/use you can always take back home with you.|`|AA12000741	im not sure about the swelling i havent had any of that..i hear propping your feet up helps...good luck     (i know it looks like a lot)    this is the list of things they gave me to bring to the hospital in my baby classes..    FOR DAD    -food, snacks (so he doesnt have to leave the hospital)  - somthing for him to do ...movies, protable video games, cards  -tylonal the hospital isnt allowed to give him any since he's not a patient  - roll of quarters for the snack machine  -tooth brush tooth paste  -camera    FOR BABY    -clothes that have been prewashed  -carseat to take baby home in  -blanket      FOR MOM    -robe  -jammies  -massager to help relax while in labor  -focal point ( a picture or somthing you love that can take your mind off of the pain)  -slipers  -hair ties or something to keep it out of your face  -make up (if u want)  -toothbrush & tooth paste  -something to wear home        basically they said anything that will make you feel more comfortable
sK8rxstvaa	I use both - but I use the cloth diapers way more. My son is 5 months old now and so I pretty much know when he'll be having a poopy diaper - I have him in a disposable for that and overnight. So I use maybe two disposables a day - three if my husband forgets to put on the cloth.    Even when I don't catch it quite right and end up having it in the cloth diaper - I use these neat diaper liners that catch almost all of it. I wipe the rest out with some wipes and then toss the diaper in the laundry basket. So far, everything has washed up great. I don't have to go to the toilet and wash them out or anything - I just wipe it out and throw it out with the disposables I use.  They also do not get soaked and they wash up just fine - even if I forget to do it for 5 days. They smell way less than the disposables too.    I'm using BumGenius diapers and they are SO easy to use. I wash them every 3 to 4 days - hang the shells to dry, throw the liners in the dryer for a bit, then hang them to dry. By the next day, they are all dry and ready to be used again.     Sure, they are a bit more work - but really, you're doing laundry anyways, you're saving a TON of waste from rotting in the landfill, and regardless of what anyone says about the energy to wash them, you are saving a lot of money in the long run.    Some people get really EWWW about dealing with the diapers but really - we're dealing with them anyways and it's not like it's THAT much work to clean them. Also, my son has NEVER had diaper rash. My husband had my son in diapers for two days straight and a rash started up but as soon as we switched to cloth again it went away.    When he was a newborn, I used disposables only until he stopped having tar-poos and was able to fit in the cloth nicely. The BumGenius diapers are all-in-ones and have been nicely fitting him at each stage so far.    So to me, the best has been cloth, but I still use both. The cloth diapers have been worth every penny to me.     Even if you buy a few and try them out - it's worth it. If you decide to get more, then ask about a bulk discount, as most stores will give it to you if you buy 15 or more. You can also sell them when you're done with them.     Any stains that start to show can be easily removed by having them hang out in the sun for a day. I use a special detergent called WonderWash (it's not expensive) and you're not to use any dryer sheets with them - but other than that, they require no special work. I use a natural bum-wipe which doesn't interfere with the diapers either - don't use that white stuff with them.    Good luck with whatever you decide to do - I hope you take a look at cloth because they are well worth it! A little bit of effort to save tons of diapers rotting in the landfill is also well worth it!|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	I'm opting for reusables, there's some great products on the market and the research indicates they're better for baby.    The pro's of cloth:  - Cheaper in the long run even when taking into consideration the electricity and water used to clean them  - Less chance of nappy rash. Because disposables have such great absorbency levels it's difficult to tell when the nappy needs changing. With a cloth one it's easier to tell.  - Cloth nappies allow for better breathability for baby's skin.  - You don't have stinking disposable nappies filling up your bins for over a week (or 2 depending where you live).  - The later products fit just like a disposable so there's no need for pins etc.  - Reusables don't sit on landfills taking hundreds of years to break down  - Some local councils are offering money as an incentive to people who use cloth nappies.    The pro's of disposables:  - Less washing  - Easier when out and about    I'm going for the Bum Genius brand cloth nappies as the parenting organisations etc really rave about them and other cloth products. I'll probably buy some eco-friendly disposables for when I'm out and about but I can't think of anything nicer than having a baby wrapped up in a soft nappy rather than a plastic sweaty one!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, I've been using disposable for the past seven months.  I just placed an order for a gdiaper starter kit and a couple of fuzzi bunz because I'm interested in giving it a whirl.    I know people say that disposables are more convenient, but I'm honestly not sure that's the case.  I mean, probably every parent has had to run out to the store late at night and pay way too much money for a tiny package of diapers.  And poop smells no matter what is holding it.    I think at first we'll probably try to use both and see how it goes -- disposable overnight and when we're out, cloth the rest of the time.  I'll have to see.  I do get a little appalled at the mountain of used diapers my son has contributed to landfills in the past 7 months.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I've done both.  Cloth are just as convenient as disposables, and surprisingly aren't that smelly.  The smells come from not using the right detergent. I've had disposables left in the diaper genie for a few days that have made me gag way worse than cloth diapers sitting in their pail for 2 days.      Yes you do have to take some time in washing diapers- but starting a load takes a minute, and the whole process is a prerinse, wash, and at times an after rinse.  All those times, all you have to do is turn the knob on the washer.   It's not hours and hours, just an extra load a couple times a week.    As far as rashes go- the only times you'd get rashes is if there is an issue with the detergent, or if you're not changing your baby enough.  Fleece is commonlyused as an inner or liner, and that wicks away moisture just as well as the gel chemicals in disposables.  You still need to change more often though, as they're cloth and can only hold so much.      If I had been smart with my 2 older kids I would have done cloth all the way, not just for environment, but to save money.  It's not much more work, and soooo cheap!!  Plus there are some fabulously cute diapers out there!!|`|dzyJw0cvaa	DISPOSAL.  I wouldnt be PAID to clean out the junk that comes out my kids bottoms!!  I have always gladly paid the price for disposable diapers.  Anything to make life easier as a parent is worth the extra $$.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Disposable, I wouldn't want to clean those and because I would be too afraid of stabbing my kid with the pins. Plus the cloth ones smell real bad of urine. My sister uses them and it seems like you can always smell the urine in them.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	cloth is better for the environment but disposable are more convenient. I personally would like to use cloth but I do use disposable. I don't have the time to sit and dump the contents in the toilet, wash them....if it's needed multiple times. I rent an apartment and I work and I don't really want to pay the diapering service to pick up, clean, and return.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	We use cloth and we love them. I found a great pattern and I made them myself, for much less of an investment than buying them. The diapers I made fold in such a way that they will fit my baby until he is potty trained. So basically I have made 20 or so diapers for a small fee, and that's all I will ever have to pay. I understand that it costs money to wash them, but you do laundry already, so what's the big deal? Have enough on hand that you only have to wash every few days or so, not a big deal. I think it's silly when people say they have the same impact on the environment as disposables because of the waste of water. But billions of people every day take showers and wash their clothes. I do not think my load of diapers every few days makes a big impact.|`|9OsjdsrZaa	Cloth is better for the environment...however, it takes a lot of man hours to clean them, and have fresh diapers when you need them.  They can also contribute to really bad diaper rashes, as they don't wick moisture away from little bums.    Disposable, while extremely convenient, are really bad for the environment.  They are also really expensive.  They do help keep moisture away, which helps with those persistent diaper rashes.      I guess you just have to decide what is most important to you. And what works best for your family.  Diapers, like most other things that parents decide on are a personal choice of preference.

X6aYVpU3aa	Make sure she is full everytime she went to bed at night, if she wakes up, try to feed her again, she might be hungry, then sleep with her for a while till she fall asleep. You sleep also and ignore her if she is keep talking, pretend that you are already sleeping and she will sleep by herself.    My kids usually wakes up or got hungry at his hour 4am or 5 am at this age.|`|vOgfAvMlaa	This worked when my fiance and i had my 3 year old niece over for the night. I told her that she had to stay in bed until the sun was 'fully awake' it is then time to get up.     or try putting her to bed earlier i have heard that sometimes helps.    good luck|`|rISHTfK3aa	There is something wakening her up. You need to find out what it is. Having a new routine should work and if it's not then something is wakening her up. Stop giving her things like milk and don't change the time you put her to bed as this may be confusing her. Just put her straight back into her bed. Try that for a few nights and see what happens.|`|3dxwK9v3aa	My daughter did this around age 2. She would wake really early around 5 AM and come wake my husband and I up. We would put her back in bed and tell her that she could not get up until the sun came up. We would give her books to read in her bed and tell her to just lay in her bed and stay there until the sun came up. She wouold fall ack asleep in no time and sleep until about 7:30 AM. Worked great. Eventually she stopped waking up and slept to 7:00 AM everyday, sometimes later. I read that moving the bedtime back later to try to "fix" the problem can actually make it worse. So keep bedtime the same!
FcHplZtQaa	Just because your HV said to start giving him a cup, it doesn't mean you have to cut down his milk intake, just give him his milk in a sippy cup instead, I'd try this one feed at a time, but if he takes his first milk feed from a cup no problem then just keep giving him the cup, another thing make the feed up in a bottle and pour it in a cup, that way you'll know how much oz he's getting!    The reason she's saying this to you, is because it's bad for babies teeth to be drinking out a bottle, ideally they should be off bottles by 12mths....    My 2 girls never had bottles, I breastfed them, and when I stopped they went straight to cups...    However my twins are 9mths and they still have bottles, though only for milk, at lunch and tea they have juice in a cup.  The only reason they still have the bottles is that they won't drink out the non drip cups only the ones that the juice/milk pours out of, sends me nuts!    Imagine the mess of their cots if I gave them a cup full of milk? exactly! LOL    As for the milk intake, your babies fine!    Babies should get 1pint of milk a day along with solids, 1 pint =20oz so obviously your right on track!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Start by giving him the sippy cup at one of his meals a day. The one where he is the least fussy would probably be the best. After he gets the hang of it, give him the sippy at each meal. (put water in it with a drop of juice for flavoring if he's still getting too much formula.) Save his bottle for before bedtime. Good luck. I hope this helps.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Firstly the recommended amount for a baby is 20oz so his milk intake is fine. He is too young to be taken off the bottle, use the sippy cup for water and juices between meals and when he is over 12months then slowly wean him off the bottle. There is no rush as babies at 2 that i know of still drink out of the bottle.|`|qpOq3jSVaa	I took away my daugher's bottle when she was about 12 months old.. she is now 16 months old she she loves her sippy.. loved it since the day I gave her it and doesn't miss the sippy at all.  Other kids are different tho.  Maybe you want to take away one bottle feeding a day and replace it with the sippy.. and etc etc until you just have the sippy.  Gerber makes the best sippy in my experience bc it doesn't spill when they knock it on the floor or dump it upside down.. and they can still drink like that.. have to suck.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Within the UK the advice you have been given is perfectly fine. Babies should not be living only on milk at 8 months, they need solids as well, and it sounds like you're doing exactly the right thing.    In terms of switching from bottle to sippy cup, I would say it's best to just go cold turkey - just don't give him any more bottles, give him all his milk in a sippy cup, including at night (as long as you're not putting him to bed with a bottle, which will ruin his teeth anyway). The fact that he will take water from a sippy cup at meal times means it should be easy to get him to take milk from one too.    Good luck.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your HVs advice is dated.  An 8 month old still doesn't really solid foods at all -- baby's formula is still the great bulk of his diet, with solids mostly for fun.    As for getting rid of the bottle -- [Pippin shakes her head] where DID your HV get her training. It's fine to introduce a sippy cup (for water and diluted juice) but there is NO reason to wean such a young baby to a cup. Babies are usually weaned from the bottle at around 12 months or later.    His formula intake is already quite low -- 24 ounces is really the minimum he should have.  So don't reduce his milk intake -- just increase his solids if he seems hungry.  And offer water in a sippy cup, but keep giving his regular bottles.  He gets both food and comfort from his bottle -- why would you want to take it away?|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I live in the UK and none of the 3 health visitors I have had for my sons gave advice like this. They all suggested they are off the bottle anytime from 12 months old. Until a baby is 12 months old, their main source of nourishment should be from milk.     As for starting him on a cup-don't bother until he can hold it and lift it himself. If he can then try it but one 'meal' at a time. However, be ready for tantrums-my son is 2 and still has a bottle for his milk but juice or water in a cup. Some babies like their bottles! It didn't harm my older 2 to have a bottle past 12 months...|`|AA10186411	The easiest way for me was to completely stop the bottle.  I wouldn't give it to my daughter except at bed time.  When I tried to give it to her just for one meal, she refused.  I had to do it cold turkey, and within days she was drinking it from a sippy cup like a pro!  Now if I could only get rid of that night time bottle lol
Rzsudrzqaa	Oh yeah... if it was just my husband and our kids (boys or girls) it would be MUCH messier.    I'm a neat freak so my house is always clean and luckily my kids do their share. Even toddlers can clean (limited of course and you have to make it a game)...     But as far as telling the difference in general.. I don't know.. I've met some messy men and women and some neat freak men and women.. it just depends...|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The women usually have better taste in the nick knacks and little things hanging around.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	That's exciting|`|A7SJT50Kaa	her clothes, shoes, purses, makeup, curling iron, hairdryer, toothbrush other personal belongings.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Does she have her own bathroom? If not all her things in the main bathroom would be a dead giveaway...also if her pocketbook is laying out, or her clothes...    My question is are you trying to hide the fact that you have a woman living with you? Last I knew you wanted this... and you kind of liked this woman...if you are worried as to what people would say..don't worry. It is none of any ones business if you invited a woman and her child to live with you.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Just more love      I added you to my contacts hope you don't mind?|`|umPQv5LLaa	lets go and do it|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Two tooth brushes in the bathroom, womens toiletries, of course you would notice.  Are you trying to hide it then?|`|Roui5iT5aa	I'd notice...|`|EzcQOTPtaa	Since she moved in with you (as a roommate) she is not putting what we used to call a "woman's touch" on the home. That would be traditional things such as flowers, figurines and pastel colors. It is true that not all woman like these things, and not all men dislike them. One thing that has remained true is that most couples have a bedroom decorated in a  traditionally feminine manner.|`|vI0WnAiOaa	most men are not neat freaks so you are one in a million to keep a real tidy home to begin with and most women are neat anyway - that said though my place looks like a bomb has hit most days and its just me and the little one here now. i just have too much other stuff to do than pick up all the time.my place definatly has that lived in feel and god forbid anyone who doesnt like it. i mostly live in organised caos so if i was in your place you would notice big time.  lucky for you your friend is tidy.  she will also be doing this as she is thankful for a roof over her head in a time of crisis for her.
K0iskcyHaa	You shouldn't go by your period date unless you are regular as clockwork, I was charting my temps and using a ovulation monitor and for a fe months had perfect 28 day cycles, ovulating on day 14, but the month I conceived I didn't ovulate till day 25! So the ultrasound is the most reliable way to know your dates. It is very precise as they measurs internal organs etc. I had the same with my daughter until i realised that I must have ovulated late with her too! Don't stress about it too much just enjoy your pregnancy!!|`|vYQMuCrQaa	Yes.  They never know the exact date its just an estimate.|`|FI916ISFaa	Doctors do not date due dates from when you conceived but from the first day of your last period.  It was in practice from the old days when that was all that doctors had to go by.  Most people ovulate (and therefor conceive) about two weeks after the first day of their period.  So if the doctor says you are 19 weeks pregnant you probably conceived about 17 weeks ago.  I know because when my wife was pregnant I wrote on a calender how many weeks she was pregnant and then had to go back and change all the dates by two weeks.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	They usually go by your LMP.  But a friend of mine who is pregnant right now too is having this same experience and she was told that a due date can be off 2 weeks either early or late.  So you could be right on what you think it is! Good luck! :)|`|In1UqryNaa	Yes he may be.  I've heard of this happening before.  Doctors have been wrong before.|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	I don't think the due date is always exact but it's around that time period.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	The doctor usually bases it on the date of your last period as well as the strength of the heartbeat  - what did you tell him..|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's an estimated date that can be off by up to 14 days. They have mine wrong by 5 because I don't ovulate on day 14. I know 100% for sure what my conception date is and when they did the ultrasound at 7.5 weeks it confirmed it, but when they calculated my due date, they counted from the start of my last period which puts it 5 days before it should be.|`|nAuqkYy0aa	yes it happened once to my sister in law|`|jYwSKzg1aa	Oh, it sure can!  There's always a margin for error.  But it's also slightly possible that your hubby's little swimmers hung around for a few days after the fact and you didn't get pregnant the day of the deed (not the full 10 days though!).|`|AA12000741	my doc says my due date is april 2nd but every time i have an u/s the baby measures 2 weeks farther along...so i asked him if he was going to change my due date and he said no that its bettter to have her early then late...so now if she isnt here by march 25th then we are being induced that morning...i guess it just depends on y our doctor...|`|jXZeoPAwaa	yes they are only measureing the size of your baby to guide them on your due date, plus they do it from your last period to, but they could have measured wrong at your first scan but when you have another one they might measure your baby near to your calculations|`|NgnbtaORaa	No doctor is infallible so sure their due dates can be called incorrectly.  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|MDfleEXWaa	Congratulations, well due dates said by doctors are not always exact either u could have ur baby coming early to the predicted date or later.. i guess its just a round time date they give
AA10781522	More than likely your birth control will pull you through. If she is under alot of stress it can cause her to be late on her cycle. If she is on the pill and miss a day or 2 it will through her cycle off. But she better to be sure to double up on the days that she missed. If she is a week or more late she may want to take a test.|`|LydL7EN6aa	have her take a test if you are that worried! i know 3 people who were on birth control and still got pregnant! one of them even still got her period every month! and only found out she was pregnant when she was having contractions!!!!|`|WgyGipBMaa	Shes prob preg congratz daddy|`|MQ34YW28aa	if she missed any pills it can make her pregnant. but my cousins wife is pregnant and she was on birth control. and my husbands exwife was on birth control and she got pregnant and she was on the depo shot. so it really depends on i guess. have her take a pregnancy test in a week or so if she doesn't get her period. if she's taking the pills she could of not taking the sugar pills to get her period and just skip them. some women do that to so they don't have to get their period.|`|wTe3qQm5aa	She could easily get pregnant if she has taken any antibiotics latley for an infection. Buy a test soon
x6UJe8jkaa	What do you expect from a 3rd world country?|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It's not the parents, it's the American/European culture that says beautiful woman have to have round eyes. Blame the McDonalds and KFC's peppering the country, not the parents. Blame the Versaces and the Prada's of the world. In our world, the highest image of beauty is a woman with fair skin, round eyes, narrow noses - basically European faces. Open any upscale magazine and it will be peppered with European faces (European faces include white American faces).    When I was in Seoul and Beijing there were numerous billboards and advertising featuring white women. Not all of them, but many. Africans and black Americans try to whiten their skin, straighten their hair and get nose jobs, and Asians try to widen their eyes and stay out of the sun. Having dark skin, kinky hair and slanty eyes in this world is not an advantage. If you want to help, be sure to encourage everyone around you to look for the beauty in African, Middle Eastern, and Asian faces. Plenty of us think they're beautiful already, but the world is trying to teach them they're not.|`|hkQSqPEwaa	I seen that on MTV .|`|3di4X6VPaa	=O  God, that's AWFUL!  Why do people do stupid things like this?!
3K7ffKn2aa	I wouldn't stress about it, at my last doc apt i was 21 weeks and had gained 8 pounds all together. And my doc told me it was too much weight. lol every pregnancy will be different. Congrats : )|`|AA12000741	im 32 wks and i have only gained 6lbs...i was very sick for the first 5months...but when doc measures me he says the baby is the size she should be and not to worry about it..|`|TzWkvyctaa	I am 23 + 3days and still weigh 4lbs less than pre pregnancy, I didn't have major sickness just lost my appetite, i have spoken to my midwife about it and she said not to worry. I have been trying to eat more though.|`|G2auAv1Saa	With my first child, I lost 12 pounds.  I am 33 weeks with my second and I have gained 3.     Long as the baby is growing properly your weight gain shouldn't matter.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i am 25 weeks 2 days and have gained about 12 pounds  my last baby i gained only 16 pounds in all 9 months you are ok|`|cypZ0ykXaa	hi! i'm 23 weeks preg & put on 6 pounds only. me & my baby r very healthy & active.in my previous pregnancy i gained a weight of 35 pounds|`|MQ34YW28aa	i was the same way with my son. i lost weight in the 1st trimester because of the morning sickness and night sickness. I gained maybe 5 pounds my 2nd trimester and then with in the 3rd trimester i gained 35 pounds. ended up with pre eclampsia so had a lot of fluid retention. but she said that's normal, every pregnancy can be so different with the same woman.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? You're not very late. Your reading to much into it. Yes, you can get pregnant from pre-***, but it's more likely from when the man orgasms cause the sperm is getting a 'jump start' on his 3 days journey to get to the egg. Stop stressing, and only test when you hit Wednesday and are still period-less. I think you're fine and stressing yourself out.??|`|d5K8wORqaa	pee stick time!|`|IjNHe4kRaa	there's always a possiblilty when having sex.  i don't know, you could just be sick.  or pregnant.  i'm sorry i can't help.  and it broke, it's still possible.    -BRiDGEt ;]|`|FdGBJdU9aa	How does the song go? Chances are your chances are awfully good, something like that. I doubt if you have a bun in the oven and since you are so nervous about it I don't think you want a bun either.  You may want to get some plan B pills or a backup like birth control pills, only a suggestion.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Your friend is wrong. Pre-ejaculation and ejaculation can both very much get you pregnant. I wouldn't try to stress out anymore as it can delay your period even more, I'd wait a couple of days and then take a test. I've heard that having a fever can through it off too|`|ZFj7J3Zaaa	Even if you are pregnant, Don't worry coz I've got an idea........  Eat some Papaya to kill that baby.|`|AA11646474	Its ALWAYS a possibility, I had a friend going through a very similar thing. The only way to really know is to take the test.|`|2qpBBTakaa	If you are really worried about it, take a pregnancy test.  You can get them at a grocery store.  Seems to me, the odds are that you are not pregnant.  Him being sick has nothing to do with him being able to get you pregnant.    Stress and being sick can mess up your period too.|`|UdV0yLJaaa	Your friend is not so correct. While there is, of course, a chance to get pregnant from pre-***, it has a very minimal amount of sperm.    And yeah, him being sick has nothing to do with it, but you being sick, on antibiotics, or stressed can delay your period.|`|OIsaEGBSaa	I am a Doctor and you have many symptoms of pregnancy and I can tell you that the chances of you giving birth after 9 months is more than likely. I suggest you tell your parents about your sex life and go see someone like me, a doctor
NvaiomHVaa	You could possibly be pregnant..you can get symptoms pretty early (i know i did).. here is an article I found about the early symptoms of pregnancy- the ones u have before u get ur period..    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    good luck with everything!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	pee on your keyboard, your results will be ready in 5 minutes.    Duh, go get a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Maybe, maybe not. You could just be getting sick. Test when if you miss your period.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	wait 4 more weeks and pee on the stick. Then tell us we really want to know.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	2 points for me, yay!      Pee on a stick when you actually MISS your period.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Yes u could. But wait until u miss ur period to take a test.|`|AA11763588	Being dizzy is your bodies way of saying you are dehydrated.    You could have symptoms now, but you'll have to wait and see if your period comes or not and take a test.|`|gyoylefvaa	maybe you're, maybe you aren't.  yes you Could  having symptoms soon.|`|bZBByJAAaa	Yes you can have symptoms at that stage. I took a test a few days before my missed period because I had sored breasts and cramps and all three tests came out positive. Take a test, it never hurts to make sure.|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	I get like that right before I get my periods. they can also be signs of pregnancy. Wait it out though before you do end up testing, especially if you are trying to get pregnant. When the test comees up as false and you're hoping for a positive it's really depressing.Good Luck.|`|J4NgqZSIaa	sometimes you can have nausea right away. i didnt until i was 8 weeks or so. but i did have breast tenderness and wuz more tired. i had lil mini cramps or pulls i would say, and i knew i wuz prego about 4 days after it happened!!! its also just a gut feeling ya kno. take a test tho 2 find out 4sure|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	Yeah you can get symptoms this early, I know its hard to wait but just wait a week or two and then take a test if you have missed your period  Good Luck!!
mgiJVjaKaa	The people who accidentally get pregnant on the pill or while using other forms of birth control are definitely the exception to the rule. For every one woman who says she got pregnant while on the pill, think of the hundred/thousand that haven't said the same thing and are probably on the pill.    Also, even if you sometimes didn't take the bc exactly as the instructions said, I think the rate of pregnancy only goes up to 5% (according to the box's instructions) so that still isn't that high.    The pull out problems or condom problems just show that unless you're having sex on your most fertile days, the likelihood of getting pregnant isn't very high. And even if you *are* having sex, trying to conceive, with him ejaculating - it's *still* only like 20-25% for the first month.     So I don't think you need to be worried about infertility yet :) Before you guys start actively trying, visit your doctor and talk about your concerns, especially your heavy period or your worries of endometriosis. But don't be concerned about infertility until you've been actively trying for 6 mos - 1 year.     It is kind of frustrating though! Because all the people I hear from the most are those that got pregnant right away, on accident, etc. But they're definitely not the "average" woman!|`|2HJgbPBvaa	First off, even if there is something wrong with you there's is so many options that you don't have to necessarily accept being with out children yet. You could have endometriosis, and you're right there's no sure way to diagnose it without doing a laporscopy. But if it were serious endometriosis that can be picked up on a ultra sound sometimes. That being said, even if you've missed some pills throughout those time periods doesn't mean that the birth control is not still working. Obviously to prevent pregnancy it's not good practice to be skipping pills, but a lot of times woman get pregnant on the pill because of other OTC and rx meds they are taking. The best thing you can do is stop the BCP and give it a few months. If after 6 months of being of BCP you still are not pregnant, then you might want to see a doctor about trying clomid or femara, which they will then bring you in through your cycles for ultra sounds to make sure everything is working as it should. And, if it ends up being endometriosis, a laporscopy procedure is very simple outpatient surgery with almost no pain afterwards.    Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|PAjHWRhsaa	Well, I'm 22 and I have thought the same exact things. Although we are trying for a baby right now. Like you said, you have been on some form of birth control since you have been having sex, as have I up until about 5 months ago. That is the number 1 reason why you have not fallen pregnant. This is a pretty common question on here. And I usually jus tell them to look at theire sex lives and most of the time that person has been on some form of birth control the whole time. There are the women who are diagnosed as being unable to have children naturally or without taking certain meds. But as long as everything shows up fine and your yearly exams show up normal then you should be fine for when you decide to have a baby. So good luck and don't stress about it yet. Even once you quit your pills it can take up to 6 months and sometimes longer for your body to start ovulating again. Some women do happen to get pregnant the month after they stop, but most don't. I wouldn't worry. I'm not yet. And I've been off my pills and using no protection or pull out for 4 an a half months.

Doctors are not legally permitted to discuss your consultations with anybody if you have expressed to them that you would like to keep it confidential.

I had a few friends who fell pregnant at your age, and even though at the time it seemed like the world had come crashing down around them, they made it work and have no regrets today.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Im not sure, but where do you plan on getting that type of money without telling your parents?|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Yes you can at places like planned parenthood. I advise you don't though, it can make you sick and off for a couple of days, your parents might notice something. i'm not going to tell you you are evil for wanting an abortion, but im definately not for them.

AA11763588	You should learn about human anatomy and how everything works before having sex.     With that said:    Any time sperm touches a vagina you are at risk to get pregnant.    And BEFORE ANYONE SAYS IT. Sperm DOES NOT DIE when it hits the air. If this were true we wouldn't have sperm banks with men ejaculating into cups.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Yes you can|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Sperm do not die when they hit the air. This is a common myth!    Sperm can usually live up to seven days when they're in the cervical mucus of a woman's vagina. However, when they're not being nourished and protected by cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, the warmth and moisture of a man's urethra and reproductive tract, or other warm and moist conditions, they die anywhere between a half an hour to four hours.    If you've touched semen, it's a good idea to wash your hands, or at least wipe them off before touching the vulva or vagina.      Your chances are most likely very, very slim but there is still a minute possibility that you could be. I wouldn't be stressed about it if I were you though. Good luck.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	2 points.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	NO
snDAuu27aa	One of my moms friends has a little boy that is lactose intolerant. He was about 16 months (he's 20 months now) when she started noticing it.  Whenever he had dairy products, he would get gas, tummy aches, and diarrhea diapers. He uses a special kind of "dairy product".  He uses soy stuff.  He has soy butter, soy cheese, soy milk, etc.  He doesn't seem to mind it. He doesn't take vitamins. I am not sure how they diagnosed him, but I hope I helped.
8pup9oWhaa	I actually disagree with everyone saying its genes, and i will let you know why...  When my pop died when i was five, i was terribly upset and got very stressed out, so did my brothers and sisters, and we dealt with it in different ways-i lost a whole bunch of hair, i was bald in a huge patch. But it was my sister who got a grey streak in her blond hair, overnight. (many people dont believe this, but its true) My mum took her to the doctors, and me, and he said both instances were caused by stress. My sister still has this streak in her hair and she is 27.  My daughter has lots of black hair, and a tiny blond streak in her hair, on the right, near her ear. Im not sure that I was majorly stressed during my pregnancy, but perhaps just a little bit of stress affects the foetus, hence why your little one has a large streak of blond in her hair.  I wouldnt worry too much, im sure she will not be affected in her adult life, and her lovely hair will be a topic of conversation when she is older!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i doubt it, i would say it is genetic; i went to school with a boy who had the same thing..|`|62hGVNhoaa	It's known as a malin streak.  I don't know if stress during pregnancy can cause them, I think they are due to a lack of pigmentation.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	My brother has brown hair with a patch of blonde hair on the front part of his head, the doctors said it is just because there is no color pigmentation there... i am assuming that this is the same thing... i think its kinda cool actaully!|`|QcGd8ktAaa	Stress didn't cause it. It is genetic.  You are just still looking for a way to punish your husband.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	It's nothing to do with stress and all about genetic mutation.    I know someone who had blonde straight hair but at the back of his head was a thick, wiry, curly clump of black hair.    I hope you dumped your husband as he will do that again.|`|00X4m7vjaa	I believe it may be called Heterochromia you can google it.  I heard about it in a movie
qBJLuCO0aa	i have never heard of that happening...|`|dPULl5hjaa	u don't make any sense|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, i think so, my boyfriend got sick when i was sick.  I told him to quit makin fun of me and quit fakin' but he was like "no really, I don't feel good, and I can't eat anything.  So my answer would be yes.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	Yeah sympathy pains. Ive even heard of men gaining weight when their pregnant women gain weight! :)|`|VD4JgFnGaa	YES IT HAPPENS ALOT|`|R31uLQvTaa	Okay.. I understand you. And the answer is no. Its a tale about the baby father getting sick or gaining weight. But, if he is not the father. Then I doubt it. He probably just has a cold.|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	yes. its called sympathy pains. met a few people who were like that lol|`|IQg3xIKAaa	Some guys get sympathy symptoms lol|`|4tf5q7EOaa	lol that's silly I am pregnant though but dont have appetite to eat any but my BF love to eat mango haha that suck he bought it for me but i dont want any food but he loves it geez|`|qTPTBlU7aa	It is not a tale. It might not make since but it is true. With both pregnancies my husband was sick. with the current pregnancy he threw up alot and thats when i went to get the pregnancy test. it was positive!
WjfV3x3iaa	i would call the police and talk to a lawyer|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	unless he abuses the kid or drives drunk with children ..you cant do anything ..Even depressed drunks can see their kids|`|bYU77eteaa	Prove that he's unfit to see your daughters unsupervised...that he would put them in some kind of danger or neglect them in some way.  If he wont...and you know this...then it wont work and it's wrong on top of that...if you can...then it's right and it will work  Take this proof to court and they will see fit what to do    Go through the court with all your actions.  Dont do anything drastic outside of court because it can be used against you.  The police wont issue random restraining orders either so if you can actually get one then thats a great start|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	if ur gonna try to get only supervised visits u better have a damn good reason the fact that he has a DUI isn't gonna cut it|`|ki5hZbcTaa	If you were never married the mother automatically gets custody at birth. The father would have to take you to court. Go to the court house and file a restraining order. A past record may help you but do not go thru a custody case without a lawyer. He could be just bluffing, my son's father did that to me for a long time.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I used to live in GA, it is a very screwed up state at least in the south where I lived. If he is harassing you by phone cal the police when he does it. You can get a restraining order, just go to the court house and talk to them. Him being a drunk, bipolar, and depressed isn't enough to get supervised visits or full custody. You have to show proof that he isn't fit, like him using drugs, neglectfulness. If he drinks and drives with her in the car or truck with him that could be enough if he is caught.    In my case though abuse wasn't enough, I had solid proof and my ex was still granted visitation unsupervised. He later lost all rights.
qBJLuCO0aa	Tell her to talk to her parents, you may think they are very strict but she is only 13. Her mother is probably only looking out for her best interests. If she wont go to her mother tell her to talk to a councilor or a doctor, as she is only 13, this girl needs help and fast.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	what kind of school would send her to alternative school?    her parents/his parents will not "kill" anyone.    she needs to be honest to everyone because she is so young.    that is her only choice.    good luck to her.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Nobody will be killing anyone. People generally love their daughter, and their grandchild. Even if they do things like getting pregnant at 13.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	a 12 year-old boy can shoot fertile sperm? WOW! That probably makes me sound retarded..but I seriously did not know that. I don;t even know what to say to this but...WOW! Thanks for the 2 points.|`|bkOn30I1aa	Hi,     Unfortunately it is a very difficult, but very common situation. More and more girls are getting pregnant even younger, last time I was at my doctors appointment there was an 11 year old pregnant girl there. Anyway, its hard for her to stop thinking like a child (like someone said), because SHE IS a child. As much as she tries, she is very young, inexperienced and immature (not saying it in a bad way, we are all like that when we are that age). Now, I understand that her parents are extremely strict (or so you say, in my opinion if they let her have a boyfriend and they even knew him, they cannot be that strict), but she needs to just come out and say what is going on. She is not going to be able to deal with it on her own, she needs some good advice from her mom or family, and as much as they are going to be furious and disappointed, I am sure they want the best for her, and whatever her decision is, they will help her with it, either taking care of the baby when its born so she can go to school, or whatever way they want to handle the situation. The best advice is for her to talk to her family and the kid that got her pregnant. This is something that will change her life forever (even if she decides not to have the baby), she will never forget about this, unfortunately its done, and there is no way to take it back. I wish her the best of luck, I really do, but it will be a very hard situation to get over.  Best wishes :-)|`|YAWkCPqYaa	she must talk to her parents|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I think abortion is the best option at that age.|`|aDwfTXyDaa	get out of school for a little while and   just get away from school until the baby is born.  i had the same problem when i was that age.|`|FufV5aZNaa	Start taking prenatals or find a planned parenthood.    It sound harsh but it's as simple as that. Hiding this and withholding prenatal care from her baby is irresponsible and dangerous for her and the baby.    She needs to deal with what's happened and stop thinking like a child. She made the decision to risk it and needs to follow through.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	She needs to tell her parents and the father of the baby. There are lots of resource  centers for young mothers. She should go to her doctor, they can set her up with some know-how..|`|v8F2UeXCaa	kill is an extreme word. your all young and ill equipped to deal with this alone. she needs to tell someone this wont go away, either her parents or doctor etc will be able to help. they will notice eventually. that is very young to be having sex and i hope u learn from ur friend xx|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Sounds like Romeo and Juliet. Juliet was thirteen, but Romeo was a tad older. Most mothers don't really kill their children. Once the steam stops coming out of her ears she will probably do what is best for her daughter. It would be silly not to expect her mother to get mad, but she will get over it.     SHE SHOULD TELL HER MOTHER! or maybe her father first, girls often relate better to their fathers at that age.|`|YjcakjFkaa	No parents will ever kill there child. Ask her to tell her parents and the boy as well. Parents are older and mature and would want the best for her. They might get angry and annoyed but in the end it will be ok. I think she will have to go for a abortion, 12 is too young age for having a child. And ask her not to venture into such a situation again!|`|JDw1RDcaaa	tell a teacher or her mum cuz its hard to hide from other people and if she wants to get rid of the baby them she needs a parents help.|`|J4NgqZSIaa	wooowww!!!! 13 and 12??? kids that age shouldnt even be having sex!!! omg!!!! i am on both sides of abortion, i had one at 16, but for other reasons, not because of my age. i dont know what to tell her!!! woow|`|zyzVSQfgaa	wait 9 months open legs and squeese|`|WiiFRW2caa	She doesn't have many options she is gonna have to tell her parents even if she wanted an abortion she is to young without parental permission I think she should think this through she has a long life left and to hold a murder over your head for so many years is gonna be torture she is so young I dont think she will be able to handle the miscarraige mentally she needs to go to her parents for help I was 21 when I got pregnant with my first son but I wasn't married and I thought my parents would disown me because they told me all the time they would but turns out they didnt it was there wasy of trying to scare me out of having sex turns out they even care for my now husband!! Good Luck but I would recommend she talk to her parents I know she scared but she wouldn't want to make a mistake by taking this babies life if there is a possibility her parents will help her and there is only one way to know for sure if they will Go to them parents sometimes will surprise you
ebQJsYTxaa	Your son will be more prone to autoimmune issues (eczema, etc.) because of the double dose of Hep B.  His body has too many hepatitis B antibodies now, and with no real hepatitis B to attack, they might start attacking the body itself. (This is the nature of autoimmunity).     I would not give him any more vaccines, and find a good ND (naturopathic doctor) to treat symptoms as they come.    I'm sorry, I know this is not what you want to hear, but it actually is a big deal.    Yes, of course, fire your pediatrician.  But get the medical records first.  Doctors do sometimes "lose" records if they are worried about a lawsuit.|`|2arZOZWgaa	I would suggest only letting your kid get one or maybe two shots at a time in the future. You could follow an alternate schedule or just decide for yourself when is the best time for your child to immunized.  For examples of these alternate routines, I would recommend the Dr. Sear's website and his book "The Vaccine Book." I have provided a link below if you choose to look.    In the future, ask the person giving the shot what it is before they give it to him, like when you are in the room getting the shot. Ask to see the label. I would not worry until your child appears distressed from the situation (then I would sue their ***!!!)  You could change pediatricians, but only if you feel like you have lost trust in your current doctor, as good doctors are hard to come by. Constantly question their methods because this is your parental right and responsibility! You have every right to be upset.     Hepatitis B is a disease transmitted through body fluids and it always seemed silly to me to be vaccinating a baby against a sexually transmitted disease. I chose for my daughter to not receive this vaccine until she is older.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, the fact that they caught it and assured you that it isn't a problem is all they can do; even med pros are human, although they should have done better than they did....if there were other probs i would change docs, otherwise, i  would prob chalk it up to simple human error since it wont cause your son any damage..i would however ask that they only charge me for the vaccination they missed and not for the appt bc it was their fault that you had to come back in...|`|TvThS81Naa	change pediatrician and get copies of the medical records/ shot records. And sue them if anything goes wrong|`|f6fCixDnaa	Your son will be fine. Your son will actually get vaccinatated against hepatitis B a few times through childhood through different aged vaccines, because the antibodies dont last that long so there is definately nothing to worry about. Hep B antibodies die off quickly compared to other vaccines and by adulthood you need another booster since all childhood vaccines antibodies arent adaquate for protection.    Id keep the paedatrician because they were upfront and honest in telling you that they made a mistake and atleast you know they are honest.   Im sure it was a one off mistake for this paediatrician and it will do absolutely no harm to your son.    I had my immunity checked last week and i need another hep b booster.   If anything your son will have a better immunity to hep b for longer. So dont stress..
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Yes you could be darling.  You had sex around your ovulation.    Those symptoms are due to hormonal changes. So definitely test when ready. Any day that period is missed is good day to test. the more days the more accurate it should be.. as levels should increase.    God bless x all th best|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You cannot physically start having symptoms directly after sex. You are not experiencing pregnancy symptoms hun.    To get pregnancy symptoms you have to have implantation occur. Implantation happens 4-16 days AFTER sex or ovulation and then it takes a few more days for the pregnancy hormone to start messing with your body and giving you symptoms. The earliest you could start having symptoms of pregnancy are 7 days past sex or ovulation but most people don't implant until about 7 days so they don't actually get pregnancy symptoms until they are a day late or so.    You very well could be experiencing PMS which starts sometimes with me at the time I ovulate. It's possible.    You are not having pregnancy symptoms though. Too early.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	only way to find out is taking the test|`|J4NgqZSIaa	4 days after i had sex i felt lil cramps or pulls. and i knew i wuz pregant!!! its a gut feeling. i wuz planning it so i wuz excited!! take a test ur mostly likely prego|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	take a test|`|IJiJbtATaa	possibly
GDobAMQ8aa	In the Similac and Enfamil listings on that site, only three types of the products were listed as "unclean".  So, re-read the website.    Edit:  Out of all the baby products, only 6 out of 24 were "unlcean".|`|BMfn0D9gaa	none i hope|`|F4xIEr1daa	ewww hopefully none
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? People can get pregnant on their period, but it's a very small chance. The sperm already has a 3 day long journey to the egg, and the blood would slow it down a lot. The chance is very slim to none. Don't worry her about this. She'll just stress herself out. ??|`|a66nvk0taa	Have you ever heard of condom?|`|MHTIe6hTaa	there's something called birth control that she can take and something that you can use called a condom. What you can do is wait until her next missed period and get a pregnancy test, and just to be sure, incase it says postive on it go to planned parenthood and they'll do a better test to find out. And if it is positive then CONGRATS you'll soon be parents.|`|3AAtPzSaaa	um why dont you stop having unprotected sex|`|zoJmDBpUaa	Just wait until next month. If her period wont come, try a test to know if she's pregnant.    A woman can become pregnant from having sexual intercourse during menstruation. In fact, recent research conducted by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that women have the potential to become pregnant at virtually any time during their cycle. While the chance of pregnancy is greater on certain days of a woman's cycle, it is never completely absent.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Chances are usually low when a female is mensturating. When you have intercourse when the women is on her period, it can cause her period to get heavier and shorter, or the opposite.|`|JYWn3lAqaa	just get a pregnancy test...|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	It's possible  but highly unlikely. You'd have to have a very short menstrual cycle, which is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period, or a tendency to have long periods. This would bring the time of ovulation closer to the time when you would start bleeding.    Conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube. Sometime during the middle of your menstrual cycle, most likely between the 12th and 16th days, an egg reaches maturity in one of the two ovaries. The ovary releases the egg into the abdomen, where it's quickly sucked up by the tulip-shaped opening of the nearest fallopian tube.      go see a doctor.|`|s9ij36Gpaa	If I remember right, it's harder to pregnant while you are on your period.  The first few days after your period are the most fertile.  I don't know much though, but seriously, if you have had a scare or 2 already use birth control!  There is absolutely no reason why you can't do that. It's not worth the stress you are putting yourselves through.... if you are lucky enough to not get pregnant have her go on the pill.  I'm guessing you are a teenager, yes?  You do not want a baby.  Don't use abortion as birth control just because you were being careless.  Good luck|`|J4NgqZSIaa	OOMMMGGG!!! PPL R SO STUPID N MEAN!!!! UUHHH MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT...PPL AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME ITS A MISTAKE!!! GROW UP      wen  i wuz on the pill, my period would always go away at night!!! and only lasted 4 days or so. if she has had "mini cramping or pulling" then she is possinly prego. cuz 4 days after i got prego (off the pill and planned) i felt that and i had a gut feeling i was. so tell her to follow her gut. and take a test soon or b4 she is suppose 2 get her next period bcuz they can detect 5 days sooner
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Talk to your doctor, but first give her water (if you are formula feeding her) and make sure that you are mixing the formula correctly as this can happen when it is too concentrated.    Keep trying the prunes, prune juice, pears, stewed apples, offer her water too.    Talk to the pharmacist about a "stool softener" such as Colace, which might be better than a laxative, or even a glycerin suppository which makes the stool soft and seems to lubricate their little bottoms so having a b/m is easier.    Good Luck - some babies are like this but you don't want to get into the habit of laxatives for such a small child.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Poor baby! Yes babies can get bowel obstructions!  Make sure you are giving her plenty of water in between feeds.  I am a Rad Tech (X-Ray) dept and hate seeing the little ones come in for GI studies.  Have you tried the glycerin suppositories?  I would definitely follow up with her pediatrician!  Good luck|`|giKCTfnfaa	for some reason she's becoming constipated.  talk to your doctor.  they will know the best course of action.  outside of apple juice and karo syrup, i don't know of any other suggestions.|`|wjKzUbFfaa	Do you breastfeeding or formula feed ? Try changing her formula (nothing with rice) , if you're breastfeeding try changing what you eat. You also need to talk to your doctor about it.  They also cannot control theirs BM so well at that age.    Poor thing.   Hope it'll go away soon.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	You don't say which formula but I suspect she is Lactose intolerant and needs a Soy formula. I had this same problem with my oldest and the Dr "insisted" it was not the formula but my sister in alw said it was and sh was right. i switched my daughter to soy and the problem righted itself in a few days! Also she stopped being "colicky" and having diaper rash. By the time she was 3 she could enjoy dairy on pizza and in yogurt and at 21 is no longer lactose intolerant - so it may or may not be permanent, for now though it may just be what she needs. Hope this helps!|`|sErzwOnSaa	child suppositories over the counter are all my kids needed.|`|KCe8dKAFaa	Please talk to your pediatrician. If they don't give you a response to try to solve the problem, then see another dr. immediately as it sounds like something that's been going on for a while, but not getting solved. Aside from that...from my experience, my daughter had this once or twice and I was calling our local 'nurse line' in a panic and talking to the dr. and all kept telling me it is normal for some babies to not poop for a week at a time. That said, I would be concerned if it's been going on this long, especially if your child is in pain. I would never give my child a laxative though (talk to the dr. right away about that). I remember the same situation as what you describe and it's heartbreaking, but I found that I really had to get prunes into her and that did help a lot. Not just once, but a couple of times over a couple of days and eventually it was okay. Is your child just starting solid foods? They may need a different variety or if still on formula, a different formula? I know for adults, iron can cause that nightmare, so maybe they are eating something often with a high iron content? Again, could be formula. There's different formula for those 6 months+ and I actually started mine a little earlier (with dr. approval). I was breastfeeding before that and I found once I started the formula, a lot of my daughter's stomach issues were solved. You may also want to check the book 'what to expect the first years'. That was my bible for everything during my daughter's first year and relieved a lot of my anxiety with all the answers to everything baby related.
c55O7jqXaa	I had the same problem and even the childrens made me sicker than a dog. You will be fine and baby wil get what they need regardless. Things that are important are iron which you can get thru your food and also Folic acid which is found in cereals.      You can also try the Iron I take and it causes no tummy upset at all because it is pure iron water that comes in sachels and is absorbed into your body within 20 minutes. It is safe for pregnant women too since it is natural occuring iron in water from Wales. It is Spatone and Seaband company puts it out. I know it works because my Iron levels were low after I had my Daughter and when I tested I was around a 4 and when tested after only taking 6 sachels it went up by several points.     I am very very sensative to all meds so for me I have to find things that absorb quickly and don't sit in my tummy. I was also sick my entire pregnancy so I understand.     I wouldn't worry too much, but just make sure you get plenty of green veggies, dried fruits are great, nuts of all kinds, plenty of water, and red meat and if you aren't a meat eater cereal fortified with vitamins|`|JvbvGtrBaa	i eat mine with food.try taking half a dose.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	nurse told me to crush it up and mix it in  with yogurt|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    Try eating them with food. if this doesnt work either..

God bless x|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i'm sorry, but ur doctor is a moron! children vitamins do not contain Folic Acid, which is what prenatal vitamins contain, it's the whole reason u're taking prenatal vitamins, bc of Folic Acid which is important for baby's development.    EDIT: u're pretty far along, and at this point ur baby has developed all his/her organs, and prenatal vitamins aren't very necessary anymore.  so just keep eating fruits which contain lots of vitamins and nutrients and just forget bout those prenatals. all our moms didn't take those bc back in the day there was no such thing, and we all turned out fine :D|`|S4DNQkFraa	My boyfriends mom didn't take any vitamins at all and he's fine. But, if you do want to take them, I suggest half a dose with a full glass of water and possibly a light snack. IF that doesn't help, then resort to taking the childrens vitamins. You're doctor knows best, so follow his advice as long as your comfy with it.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Its a bit late to be thinking of this at 30 weeks...you've come this far....|`|2N4j1ficaa	i have never took any  when pregnant just eat properly and you will be ok if poor diet then eat em  by the way 11 children all ok .. nothing that was wrong with then has any thing to do with food
c55O7jqXaa	It could just be really irritated. I noticed I was a lot more sensative in that area when I was pregnant. I just think it is due to hormones. It is safe to put some Neosporin with pain relief in that area and also maybe sleep without your undies to let air hit that area. It is going to burn when you pee. You can also use a little baby wipe or sanitary wipe without perfume in it of course to help clean the area. Sometimes even slipping a litle moistened tissue with some neosporin on it in your undies helps. I have had lots of injuries in this area in the past-ha and know what works. Give it a few days to a week to heal. It will be fine.|`|R31uLQvTaa	I would contact my doctor. And get retested. You probably had a test at the beginning of your pregnancy.It doesn't sound like a pregnancy symptom. So I would do another set of test and emphasize on all the testing not just blood drown but, also a pelvic exam. Also get him tested also(Jokes aside). Good Luck!!|`|FufV5aZNaa	I would check with our Dr. tomorrow but in the meantime try not to worry.    There is more blood flowing through your abdomen and vaginal area during pregnancy. The basic concept of arousal is that your girly bits get engorged with blood so with these two factors working together it may be the culprit.    Also sex can irrate your urethra because it's so close to the action and can get a bit of the friction.|`|ZglMbhWaaa	Yes I agree with the others it could be a UTI. Do not hesistate to get yourself checked out! Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!|`|4tf5q7EOaa	I am preggy too just used ******* to your husband haha|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would call your doctor and ask him tomorrow.

uNsWwMfwaa	No, the baby doesn't come faster.  When you're pregnant and you walk a lot, it helps keep you, and your growing baby, fit and in good cardiovascular shape and as a plus, it's one of the most low impact forms of exercise you can do and not harm your developing baby and it strengthens your muscles that you use during the delivery.  Walking is something you can safely do right up until you deliver.  Walking is an ideal activity during pregnancy because it doesn't stress your body in any way that's unfamiliar.      The latest research shows that regular exercise during pregnancy strengthens women's bodies to help them withstand the rigors of pregnancy, and helps reduce women's risk of developing two of the most dangerous illnesses associated with pregnancy: gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia.  Walking may also help you sleep better and result in fewer medical interventions during delivery. If those aren't enough reasons to ask your physician about a prenatal walking program, consider that many women say exercising reduces the aches and pains associated with pregnancy, and boosts their energy levels and self-esteem.      However, here are a few safety tips to keep in mind:    ?Consistency is more important than intensity. Your walking workouts don't have to be vigorous, although they should be regular (at least three times a week), rather than sporadic. This isn't a time you should train hard. The goal should be to maintain a fitness level you feel good about, so you can withstand labor and recover from childbirth more quickly.  ?You can stay fit and still take it easy. If you exercised regularly before your pregnancy, resist the urge to compare yourself to how fit you used to be. Who cares if you walk half the distance that you usually do? If you walk on a treadmill, forget about the readout on the computer. Exercise during pregnancy isn't a competition! Remember that you're supporting two cardiovascular systems now, and it's natural to tire more quickly than you did before.  ?Besides paying a little more attention to where you're going so you don't lose your balance, the main thing is to protect your back. Even during the early weeks of pregnancy when weight gain and a changing center of gravity aren't issues yet, pay attention to your posture: Keep your chin parallel to the ground, but don't jut your chin out or stare at your feet, either. Keep your eyes forward and your shoulders back.  ?Choose shoes that are meant for walking, rather than running. Walking shoes provide the support you need so that your feet don't turn inward or outward excessively. Make sure your shoes fit well: They shouldn't feel too tight or rub your ankles or toes. As your pregnancy progresses and you gain weight, you may be more comfortable in light hiking shoes. Plus, as your baby grows, your center of gravity changes, which can affect your balance. Light hiking shoes may help you keep your balance on uneven ground because they provide more traction.    Even if you break up your walks into several short sessions throughout the day, you'll still reap the physiological benefits. Most physicians say it's okay for a woman to maintain her current level of fitness during pregnancy, but she shouldn't try to increase it. Here's how you might alter your program as your pregnancy progresses:    ?First trimester. Ease into it. Aim for at least one leisurely walk every day. Some days you might only feel like taking a 10-minute stroll to the bus stop in the morning, but a second 15- or 20-minute walk at lunch may boost your energy for the rest of the afternoon. This is the time to establish an activity habit, even if you're struggling with nausea,  because walking seems to help ease those symptoms. (If you're used to a daily run, it's fine to continue that, if you feel up to it.)  ?Second trimester. Your energy levels have returned to normal! Take advantage of this stage of pregnancy when most women report they feel their best, and alternate between long, slow rambles and shorter, more intense walks. Or just do whatever works: The key is to keep moving without overdoing it.  ?Third trimester. This may be a time for slowing down a bit, but definitely don't quit. When it comes to exercise during the last part of pregnancy, it's back to square one for many women. Try dividing your walks into several short outings each day, rather than a single long one. Since you may be off-balance by this point, choose the safest, flattest route.     Here's a summary of the current exercise guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical experts:    ?Continue mild to moderate exercise routines at least three days a week.  ?Never exercise to exhaustion.  ?Don't exercise in hot, humid weather or when you are sick with a fever.  ?Drink extra water on the days you exercise, and keep a bottle with you as you walk.  ?Avoid activities that may cause you to lose your balance, especially during your third trimester.  ?Avoid bounc|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    ive heard that it helps.im not sure but i do i know that, it does work the muscles.So it is good.    God Bless x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could help induce labor when you are late term BUT it doesn't always work.|`|hZuq2XT9aa	when you keep fit,labour can be alot shorter..:)  but i dont know about inducing it|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Toward the end of your pregnancy,it can help get your water to break.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	definitely not. the baby is going to come when he/she is ready to come out. walking is good exercise though. :) good luck|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it all depends on how much u walk around.     yes, walking helps to have easier labor bc it works out the muscles u're gonna be using during labor, but don't overdo it though, my friend walked a LOT w/ her first baby and it actually ended up complicating her pregnancy, one of the things was her heart rate going up bc she walked for 2 hours none stop at the gym. but w/ her second baby she just walked couple of blocks and had very easy and fast labor.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	no|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	No it only helps near the VERY end when the babys head is engaged to put more pressure and bring him deep into the pelvis.|`|Sgyspffwaa	I've heard this. With my first son I was in labor for 10 hours.     My second son I walked a lot and it was a horrendous 18 1/2 hour labor ending in C-section.     My third son I walked a lot too. I was in labor for 24 hours before they did an emergency C-Section because I just wouldn't dilate.|`|2N4j1ficaa	lol dont believe ever thing your told   no|`|5MBdJK4Baa	my doctor told me to walk everyday, he said it will help the muscles that you use to delivery and make for a much easier birth|`|gBEq0zo5aa	sometimes it can bring on labor if you are close. It probably will do nothing until you are like 39-40 weeks. I think it is the weight of the baby and all the fluid pushing on your cervix as you walk that helps you dialate.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Well it's always good for you to walk but it won't always help get labor moving faster. I walked constantly through my entire second pregnancy and I was still induced at 41 weeks. Some women will swear that it works great and others (like me) will have no luck with it.|`|BeNazR8Jaa	my mother keeps telling me to walk a lot because it makes labor lot easier. So she says.|`|FufV5aZNaa	Walking can help bring on labor if your full term. But everyone is different and this does not work for everyone.|`|2XI6n1Noaa	Are you retarded?|`|mYowSmC2aa	When I was pregnant... walking didn't induce labor. But it helped me become dilated a lot faster.
Jo2DfRzaaa	i've done  2 trips like that w/2 kids.  give yourself plenty of time.  take a dvd player.  snacks.  cheapo toys that she has never seen before.  i stopped every 2 hours or so to get out and stretch and get out of the car.  i took my time.    if she'll sleep in the car go for the middle of the night journey. my daughter was 2 when we did our trips and she slept terribly in the car, she would sleep some but then wake up.  it was really bad when we hit traffic and were sitting still, she always woke up.  not sure what kind of car sleeper your daughter is.  i swear by that dvd player for long trips.  it saved my sanity.     good luck and have fun!|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Bring some sing along songs, toys, snacks, blanket, pillow...in case she wants to sleep.|`|AA10742362	booze!  just kidding!!!!!  i would either drive at night so she sleeps but make sure u can stay awake or drive when theres not much traffic during the day and if possible check on line for fun things to stop at for her age.  just be prepared to talk alot/answer questions.  u could also get a portable dvd player and bring movies.  im not a big fan of those but a few of my friends have them and swear by them.  ive driven from tempe arizona to los angeles and also tempe to barstow.  if u havent driven it it can be very long and very flat so a dvd may be good for those areas.  enjoy!!!|`|sa0EwdvEaa	buy her a leapfrog..my kid had one and was good the whole  trip...|`|8nLuyDmPaa	Best bet would be to drive at night if you are up for it.  She may sleep most of the way.    I would also suggest a car DVD player with a few of her favorite movies.    Also, if she likes certain songs, burn them to cd or bring ipod along to hook up if you have one.    Other than that, plan to stop often, such as at a McDonalds with a playland or a rest area with a playground.  The more she can get out, stretch her legs and burn off some agitation, the better she will do better.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I think diriving in the night is your best bet. Bring some snacks, comforting toys ans stuffed animals to snuggle with, maybe a little light in case your daughter wakes up and is scared

She also says "oma (dutch for grandmother)", "opa (dutch for grandfather), "Nic (for her Aunty Nicole)".  Plus many other words.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Besides mama and dada, My daughter said Thank-you at 10 months old. now at 14 months says way to many things to name off! lol|`|XzV4bUeFaa	My oldest son said "car" at about 10 mos.    My youngest said "dog-dog" at 8 mos.|`|ScHW4842aa	i was about 4 months old when i blurted out the cat's name at the dinner table while my mother was feeding me. Everyone just stopped and stared.     and yeah, it is true.|`|ed766aacc26b258767da06e39783b5fdaa	at 8 months my baby said 'cack cack' ("quack quack") and at 8 1/2 months, "duck".

Surprisingly his first word (no joke I had witnesses) was hi at like 4 months, but he said it very rarely.|`|jYPeis3Saa	uh-oh  and giraffe at almost 12 months.    started babbling momma and dadda at around 6 months    he is now 15 months and says momma, dadda, uh-oh, giraffe, dog, no, that, tree, door and a few others.    oh i forgot to add, that if you ask him what a cow says he responds with "moo" and if you ask him what a piggy says he "oinks"   he also says sssshhhhhh with his finger up to his lips. so freakin cute!|`|sAAnquoTaa	Idk yet. My daughter's 7months and says mamama, but that's it.|`|F4xIEr1daa	At about 14 months my son said "string cheese"|`|79e0b7f7837c148c68a70137c95ae851aa	my daughter just turned a year on 2/1 and her first actual words were lady (i was lady and not mommy) and oookay at like 6 months then mama dada.. came at 7 months and now dandy (i have a dog named sandy).. meema (grandma), heyyy, cup, juice, duggy, stop, huh, dingdong.. she babbles and babbles.. depends on how much interaction the child gets|`|6EOcwRkAaa	My oldest son's first words were "9,8, 7, 6,5,4,3,2,1!" He was a very late talker (maybe 18-22 months?) His 18 month older sister did all the talking for him. One night, she didn't want to get in bed- I said I was counting to 10- he just chimed in with a big smile. (He always loved it when his sister was in trouble!) I was so worried he had speech problems- turns out he just never had the incentive to talk.
q0JTN9QAaa	I never thought I could be an effective parent till I first saw my baby boy, then I knew I had to for him because he was so perfect and deserved the best parent ever so I needed to be that.  I think I do pretty good but when my wife took the test and it was positive I was scared to death and still get shaken sometimes.     Fear is good it makes you think before you act and shows you care.|`|44OH7Si6aa	My husband was so happy when we got pregnant with our first, I only felt panic. I had no idea what I was going to do with a baby and wasn't sure I was cut out for the mommy thing. Even when he was born I just sat there in my hospital bed staring at him and thinking to myself, OMG that's a baby. I tried to avoid doing anything with him by myself for the first week because I was certain I was going to screw it up. Then, my husband went back to work and left me to take care of the baby by myself and I didn't screw it up, in fact the day went pretty well and after that I was fine. Now I am a stay at home mommy with baby  3 on the way and I honestly couldn't be happier doing anything else.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I am the father of three, and always swore I would not have kids.    Kids have a way of making you grow up..  It is not longer about what is best for you, but for them.    It is a full time, hard job.  I think it is worth it though.. :-)|`|8Y9timR4aa	i am not a parent     please answer my question its in my profile|`|DsEzLLbJaa	parenting is natural, once you hvae a child its like an instinct.|`|oog7eBnHaa	Of course I was nervous with my first, however, I was fortunate enough to have had taken care of my baby nieces, and two cousins.  However, Instinct does kick in once you have a child.  Especially for women.|`|LqN5Am1naa	Bless your heart for your sincerity and please know that almost all new and potential parents feel like you do at one time or another. As the mother of three grown young women, even though I made plenty of mistakes I could not be prouder of my daughters.    No one gives you a book on how to be a good parent, all you can do is ask, ask, ask. Ask your pediatrician, parents, friends who already have kids, clergy etc.     We all have fear that we are not going to do enough, do too much, blah, blah, blah, but in the end if you just love your child as much as you can, always listen with an open heart you will do okay, just like many of us did.    By the way, if you don't feel like you are ready, what's the hurry? If you aren't married or if you are and the time is not right then just wait. You have a few good years of fertility left and rushing to have kids for the sake of it is not the right way to go. And yes, our feelings do change...looking into a face that looks like yours, knowing that they love you unconditionally and knowing that you would move heaven and earth to protect that little child from anything and anybody..makes all those questions you have seem like nothing.     You are a smart young person for asking and wise for not rushing into things. Good luck and God Bless You!
fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Vaseline is best. The other stuff is just expensive and does the same thing as petroleum jelly.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I use chapstick.  I never thought it wasn't okay to do so, lol.  He actually knows what it is and sticks his lips out when I bring it over to him, LOL|`|n6XYYyoLaa	with constant use, your lips will get used to it; i would take a very thin layer of vaseline and apply it to his lips....not flavor to tempt licking it off.....|`|rFtKFp03aa	Do you breast feed? If you do still you can put breast milk on them, or if you have nipple cream.. (yeah kinda gross, I guess, but you put it on your nipple then your baby eats, so equal)     I would put a little bit of chap stick on them.. if you don't have either of the above.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I have Baby Bee Cream by Burt's Bees.they have a whole line for babies now .I used it for my LO's Chapped nose and chin ..worked very well...its safe to use on their tooshies as well, so I think its ok on the lips. Just a lil bit.   But also try Lanolin for Breast feeding..its safe to use while nursing so its safe enough to use on baby's mouth.     "Lansinoh Lanolin"|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Use Vaseline.  It's fine for baby.  Just a little will help a lot.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Baby Burt's' bee works great.  Also, try putting it on at bedtime.  That way he won't be as likely to rub it off and it can penetrate into his lips.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I'm sure something like Vaseline (petroleum jelly) would be fine. I would just avoid anything that's mentholated or anything like that. Sometimes the cooling sensation that's soothing for adults is more like burning for babies.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	try using a damp warm cloth to exfoliate them once a day, and I think put a little amount of organic chopstick on your finger first then apply so you dont overdue it :)|`|HjXV4zQLaa	They sell baby chapstick at like babies r us. You can put i like all over there face it's for dry chapped skin. I have some but I've never used it.|`|x7vTKP24aa	lanisoh lanolin is safe, and works well. also bordeuxs makes a product called sweet cheeks, for lips and cheeks.|`|losfOBy8aa	I'm a nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit... babies get chapped lips all the time.  We use Vaseline brand lip balm (comes in a squeeze tube, can get it for less than a dollar at Wal*Mart with all of their other chapsticks and such in the medication section).
K2jT1z5jaa	hey    it is normal but since the smell. it could be an infection.  Definitely on how you feel go to the doctor or hospital.  I would say hospital to make sure you are okay. You are pregnant aswel.  You cant be too cautious.    god bless x|`|7bdhpvc9aa	you might have a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. I got bacterial vaginosis when i was pregnant and i had the same symptoms. It's better to call the doc just to make sure he doesn't want you to go in now. If you are concerned the call the doctor. It is always better to be safe then sorry. Good luck|`|bk0IbI9faa	If it concerns you then you should call the doctor.  Its better to be on the safe side.  Its most likely normal discharge, but you should probably talk to the doctor and get checked out and make sure you aren't leaking amniotic fluid.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	UTI and yeast infections can be very common with pregnancies. that might be it. Check with your doctor to be safe, because if left untreated they can hurt the baby.|`|R31uLQvTaa	No. You shouldn't. Vaginal discharge is very common during pregnancy. Their are different types of how it could come out. Your doctor can pin point which one. Or it could just be a yeast infection. But, just double check on Tuesday. As long as your not bleeding then I wouldn't worry too much. Good Luck!|`|QaHp9ryPaa	Discharge is normal during pregnancy as long as it is clear you should be just fine. If it is an unpleasant odor you might want to get checked out. but there is a difference between bad odor and your natural scent.
ggfE4rlvaa	Too soon to tell anyway. If you used a condom and it didn't break..then no.|`|wiPAz9uGaa	Stop having sex man why does everyone have to have sex.. Its called self control............

If your that worried about it get a test.|`|hlztyMYyaa	don't worry too much about it if you used protection you are probably fine but like one said if it makes you feel better test       BTW kudos to you for using protection.|`|hFvEvkqoaa	honey when you are pregnant then you stomach will be hard right below the belly button and u would not know if u just had sex 2 weeks ago u have to wait at least two weeks before your missed period and then you can freak out|`|zMUPTexSaa	could be a symptom from an STD. get checked?|`|CyJSts2Uaa	noo, bcuz even if you were preggers  you wouldnt be showing already  aftr 2 weeks, no    ur jus thinking about it too much  i was lik that the very first time i did it too    dont worry

n2O0NwR6aa	Yes ma'am.  Ovulation is the first thing that happens; it means an egg is released from the ovary.  If it's not fertilized by a sperm, out it goes, along with the menstrual flow.  You can't have a period without ovulating first.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. She ovulates and then when the egg is not greeted with sperm, it flushes out.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Yes she can. Because it may that week that she ovulates and period starts for her.  its unknown. but yes possible    god bless|`|oluzjSgjaa	The menstrual cycle begins during puberty, usually about two years after breast budding, starting with first ovulation (which is pretty undetectable) and then showing itself with the first period, called menarche. Most young women now begin to menstruate between the ages of 9 and 16. If a young woman is seriously underweight, malnourished, excessively dieting, overexercising or has an eating disorder, that may delay menstruation because a certain amount of body fat is needed for menses to occur. For the big skinny on periods and menstruation, see On the Rag.    Vulval changes: Like with the penis and testicles for boys, the vulva grows larger and will start to look more|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes..  women ovulate before they have their mensturaul cycle..  on average, ovulation occours 11-18 days before the period.    So yes, woman will ovulate before she starts her period.
C55pji5Qaa	Congrats.I found out at 6 weeks. I too am having twin girls but they are identical. I am due April10th but the doctor says she expect them to be here in the next month.I am so excited and ready for them to be here. I have been on bedrest for 11 weeks!This is such a special event. I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes smoothly!|`|h7F4wA7eaa	No not yet, twins and quads run in my family my mom is a twin, and my moms has 4 brothers adn they are all quads.

grKtTRYtaa	If they don't have $ or insurance, make an appointment with Easter Seals or March of Dimes.    They can tell you what to do;  they are the professionals.  Even my brother (now a millionaire) could not speak clearly until 11 because a muscle did not develop  because of genetics;  even 50 years ago my parents were able to get him some help.    There are organizations that deal with this all the time;  they are free or low cost. Isn't it better to find out IF there is something wrong to treat it?   Maybe they will get an all-clear message.    Another suggestion:  Call the school district and ask this question.  They even have early classes for children who need them.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	One of my little sisters (now 16) potty trained late, had accidents and was difficult to understand when she was little (the sister who is a year older than her used to translate what she was saying).  She also would zone out a lot (for example, start playing with toys two minutes into cleaning up).  She's a completely normal teenager now, well, as normal as any teenager is.  The bottle is probably just his parents spoiling him by not insisting on taking it away.  They should do that ASAP, get his hearing checked, avoid too many sweets to see if that helps with the not sitting still.  If he is still having lots of problems after addressing all those issues, maybe see a doctor.  It could just be he's developing at a different rate or has some challenges (hearing, etc.) that other kids don't have to deal with.|`|1nMYqT1qaa	He could have Asperger's Syndrome (a high-functioning neurological condition similar to Autism).|`|Lprtz2A9aa	Is he very stubborn and strong willed? My brother had all those symptoms and he just has learning disabilities, but my mom could tell very early that he was a little off. He learned a bit slow and his language skills were bad. Still are in fact but he manages. My parents tried to get him as much help as possible but it was difficult and doctors were no help. They tried pills, an speech therapy and got special help in school. But really what worked best was being a little more patient with him and giving him a little extra help with school work.|`|bh6QrzWraa	Maybe you could recommend he visits a district health nurse or gather some information or pamhplets from a local doctor. I work in a childcare centre, and by four years old he should certainly be talking often and clearly. He may have Autism or hearing troubles.|`|260846950242e261586201427ac13235aa	Are his parents spending time to work with him to drink from a cup?  Are his parents spending time talking to him clearly so he can understand how to formulate words? If yes, then we can think about neurological issues. If his parents are ignoring all of this, I have to place a lot of the blame on them.|`|xpi1KVsWaa	The whole cars thing, its normal.    The bottle thing is probably because his parents haven't really tried to get him off it.    Now, for the talking part, maybe he just has some speech problems.  My little cousin kinda has the same thing, but she entered pre-school and is doing better. She is going to turn 4.
pj5bUjbQaa	My friend has an incompentent cervix.. her son was born at 27 weeks.    it can be hereditary but also not.. Her mother had no preemie babies.    Talk to your doctor about the fact your mother had to preemie babies and see what he says..       if they were to find that you had the same issue there is a cervical stitch that can be done to keep from your cervix dilating prematurely       good luck    p.s. my friends baby although tiny is now a happy healthy normal 10 month old.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	I haven't asked a doctor but I would say it can be hereditary. Both my brother and I were born 6 weeks early, and my son was born 4 weeks early. I ended up having a c-section because I was shaped weird and the baby couldn't fit. My mom had the same thing but because me and my brother were so tiny we would fit. My son was 8 1/2 lbs even though he was early, I was diabetic.|`|cO9sxO9raa	My mom had the same problem my brother was born at 28 weeks also and I was born at 34. I asked my doctor about it because I was wondering the same thing and he said every woman has a chance of going into labor early but no it is not hereditary. I am currently 32 weeks and thankfully no signs of labor 8 more weeks to go.  God Bless. =)|`|B7FL0rdqaa	Problems like that generally aren't genetically inherited. I've heard it happening to a couple of the women in my family as well, I've also heard it can be caused by poor nutrition, previously diagnosed reproductive problems, infections, a lot of things can cause it. But I've read nothing about it being hereditary.    I wouldn't worry!
2N4j1ficaa	no means nothing my first was 8/2 my last 7/2   and biggest was 10 /2     and we were told he was going to be small ..  just wait and see  if you are over weight then that makes a big difference people who are obese do tend to have large baby's .. are you classed as obese not being funny .. or nasty|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    My partner was born at 28 weeks : So he was very little - He is 6'1' now.  And i was born at 37 weeks : but i was small.

Most first babies are smaller- around 7 1/2 pounds. We have 2 friends that are very heavy set- and their baby was 6 1/2 pounds.

They might say "Oh, well your baby will be 8lbs,then she had the baby. It was 6lbs". So they might have the machines but, they could be wrong. And six weeks after the baby birth, the baby will be a chunky cute thing. But, guess thats what we have to wait and see.

791260888aee6f983e848c56e8976e8eaa	One good sized baby and a lot of amniotic fluid would be enough. The skin and tissues are amazingly elastic and stretch well-think sextuplets or even twins.I took care of a lady who was about 5'1 and 140lbs before she got pregnant. She gave birth to twins whose combined weight was just over 17 lbs. Add to that the fluid and placentas and you're looking at at least 20lbs. She looked like a walking beach ball but no skin tearing,just a lot of stretch marks and the skin won't ever tighten up completely.|`|AA10930485	as many as God would bless my womb|`|ca4c1597490887beb9c1aee5d8ae8b3caa	U can get that big with just one and no you dont blow up lol you just feel like it|`|dc0954f5622e90cdab622512ba12dd9eaa	1 kid and no your stomach wouldn't blow up.............|`|1f7d09ed43e816cd5b47cf9218648980aa	just one|`|AA12068121	1 huge 9lb kid.|`|6377a1c71ddf8352d131832a7fbb38d5aa	First of all, your stomach wouldn't blow up since you don't carry babies in it.  Second, it can be as little as one kid to get that size.  Third, you can "blow up" so to speak.  I did.    Is this a serious question?|`|3fed4492eef25a7be264bea6f017c896aa	Well its funny you say that because i was huge. I mean huge. Everyone kept insisting that i was having twins. It just turns out that i inherited a family trait of holding alot of amniotic fluids. My kids were 8lb 9oz and 7lb 15oz. so average sized baby's with alot of room for them to swim around in. LOL.
RFJClxnaaa	Well i have four...  It was hard having a second one especially because it was twins, But you cope i guess. The hardest ages would have to be either 0-3 or 12-16 haha.

It's stressful at first, like the arrival of every new baby, but you adjust and adapt.  The older children learn to be self-sufficient in some ways and you just juggle  your time to give everyone enough attention.    There was no hardest number, it really gets easier as you go along, organisation is everything, if you're getting stressed step back and breathe and focus on the priorities.  It's definitely a blessing!    I have 6 children, ages 13, 11. 9, 7, 4, and 23 months.  We also have up to 3 foster children with us at a time.|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	We are waiting on  5...    I would say going from 1 to 2 kids was the hardest transition, but from there it gets easier - they entertain each other. Now that we're on to  5, our oldest are 14 & 10 & very capable of helping with the younger two and the new baby. We sit big kids next to little kids at the dinner table and they are assiged to help the younger one.  They help with reading to their brother & sister, bathing them, and everyone has jobs that they are capable of doing.  Our youngest wipes the table after dinner, next one sweeps, two older do the dishes & wipe counters & vaccuum.  It really works quite well.     As far as expenses, its not so much wrapped up in clothing etc...but in their extra curricular activities - 3 of them are in dance, 1 in gymnastics, 1 takes violin, 1 takes guitar...But the biggest expense is their schooling.  They go to a Montessori & we make sacrifice to allow them to attend there because of our belief in their philosophy.      Hopefully, they will all grow up to be loving, caring people & good citizens.  That's all I can ask.

Also, if you're not having twins, you could combine the names, because Jessica Marina sounds and looks beautiful. If you ARE having twins, there are a bunch of middle names you can use and cute ways to do it ;    Marina Jasmine  Jessica McKinley    Marina Jessabelle  Jessica Marie    Marina Jane  Jessica Michelle    Marina Jalise  Jessica Malissa    ---> (all of those names have the same initials, backward for each child. it's not as corny as the whole "rhyming" think people do with twins, but still cool.)|`|k86KdyYOaa	Marina makes me think of boats.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	marina a girl living under the sea  jessica like my best friend. hilarious.
XPzdqiC0aa	Well unfortunately there is a chance you are. Get a pregnancy test immediately, take it first thing in the morning (morning urine is best). In fact buy a three pack, if the first one comes out negative wait a few days and take the next one, and so on....The sooner you know, the better so that you can decide what steps you want to take ... and stop drinking now, just in case...and I'm sorry about your heartburn, sometimes stress makes it worse...|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I am sorry that you are sick.

This is because BC is making your body think youre pregnant.  You see BC tells your brain that you're pregnant, and thats why your body changes.  swollen breats, wider hips, and late periods are all a part of the process, after about 2-3 months of constant BC you should be good, the swelling down and your periods should be back to a normal 28 day cycle.

Your body has to get used to the pill. If you just started taking the pill for the first time in your life then you have to have 2 cycles on the pill before it starts to really work, as told to me by an OBGYN.    How do you know neither of you has an STD? You ONLY know that if you both get tested by a doctor for all stds including HIV. Otherwise you are assuming you dont have anything. Sometimes people can appear healthy for years while actually having HIV.    You need to use condoms at least for 2 months while your body gets used to the pill. Take an at home pregnancy test kit if you think you might be pregnant. If you continue to take the pill while pregnant then you could hurt the baby so make sure you arent pregnant now!|`|Ek9PgoWUaa	My nurse told me that when using Ortho tricyclen, one should wait a whole month before unprotected sex.

But tender breasts were the first sign for me... so tender I couldn't even face the shower head without covering them up. I didn't get bad morning sickness until I was about 4-6 weeks along.

S4DNQkFraa	A hernia is simply an overstretched muscle. Babies are born with them all the time, it shouldn't be anything to worry about. It either goes away on its own, or has to be removed by surgery. And, the fact that you're pregnant, you could have a blockage, but you also mentioned that you're not constipated by any means, so I would wait until after the baby is born and go from there.

After your period finishes try then so its less messy.  Bleeding in early pregnancy is very common and is generally no cause for concern. Around half of all pregnant women have a little bleeding in the early months of pregnancy. Although some of these women may later suffer a miscarriage, the majority carry on to have normal and straightforward pregnancies. Some women bleed for a few days around the time of their expected periods, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This bleeding is usually much lighter than a normal period, but may be accompanied by discomfort - sometimes even pain - and a heavy, dragging feeling. The medical term for this sort of bleeding is 'decidual' bleeding. The 'decidua' is the innermost lining of the uterus, the part lost during each menstrual period. Experts think that this bleeding is from that part of the decidua that is not yet covered by the developing embryo and placenta. Very early bleeding may be 'implantation' bleeding rather than decidual bleeding. Implantation bleeding happens about two weeks after conception, when the fertilised egg reaches the uterus and embeds in the soft lining. Special cells surrounding the egg burrow deep into the lining, almost like a seed putting out tiny roots. This is the start of the placenta. Some women loose a little blood when this takes place. Implantation bleeding rarely lasts for more than a day.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Not now.

As for other things> baby's can hear in the womb so things that she does or listens too yes the baby will hear. Also the foods she eats and how healthy she is will have alot to do with how your baby arrives.

When he gets home from work, he thinks he's going to get a break; when he gets home from work, you're thinking YOU'RE finally going to get a break.    It complicates things more since the father is usually more likely to just let the baby cry/feel it is acceptable to just let the baby cry.  I know I always felt that if my wife didn't want to take care of the baby, then she should take a break.

Yes, This is pretty much what it is like until your kids are big enough to entertain themselves safely for a little while while you do dishes and laundry.

I'm sure your husband doesn't thinnk you are a horrible person, he just doesn't get to spend the time with the baby that you do and he is still really excited. It gets better- you start to get a routine, and when the weather warms up, you can get out of the house and go to the zoo and the park and it really is nice staying at home and watching your little ones- they grow up so fast. Just remember 11 months from now, you baby will probably be walking! Just enjoy it while you can! Also, just because your husband works, doesn't mean he is exempt from helping with the baby. You also do a very important and exhausting job all day (let him do it for a day- leave him a list of all the things that need to be done) and you also should be entitled to breaks and an hour of peace. Have your hubby play with the baby when he gets home and go take a nap for an hour. They can bond and you can sleep. Also, nap during the day when the baby naps. I know there is so much to do, but your body just went through major trauma and if you let it heal, you will be much more effective a month or two from now.

AA12156890	Consider these early symptoms of pregnancy, which may begin in the first few weeks after conception.  Tender, swollen breasts    Your breasts may provide one of the first symptoms of pregnancy. As early as two weeks after conception, hormonal changes may make your breasts tender, tingly or sore. Or your breasts may feel fuller and heavier.  Fatigue    Fatigue also ranks high among early symptoms of pregnancy. During early pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone soar. In high enough doses, progesterone can put you to sleep. At the same time, lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure and increased blood production may team up to sap your energy.  Slight bleeding or cramping    For some women, a small amount of spotting or vaginal bleeding is one of the first symptoms of pregnancy. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus - about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a normal period and doesn't last as long.    Some women also experience abdominal cramping early in pregnancy. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.  Nausea with or without vomiting    Morning sickness, which can strike at any time of the day or night, is one of the classic symptoms of pregnancy. For some women, the queasiness begins as early as two weeks after conception.    Nausea seems to stem at least in part from rapidly rising levels of estrogen, which causes the stomach to empty more slowly. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so various odors - such as foods cooking, perfume or cigarette smoke - may cause waves of nausea in early pregnancy.  Food aversions or cravings    When you're pregnant, you might find yourself turning up your nose at certain foods, such as coffee or fried foods. Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes - especially in the first trimester, when hormone changes are the most dramatic.  Headaches    Early in pregnancy, increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes may trigger frequent, mild headaches.  Constipation    Constipation is another common early symptom of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through the intestines - which can lead to constipation.  Mood swings    The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Mood swings are also common, especially in the first trimester.  Faintness and dizziness    As your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops, you may feel lightheaded or dizzy. Early in pregnancy, faintness may also be triggered by low blood sugar.  Raised basal body temperature    Your basal body temperature is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature increases slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your basal body temperature to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean you're pregnant.|`|NT0lR87raa	1 month: getting sick, cramps|`|AA10506750	The earliest symptoms of pregnancy include:  - sore breasts with heaviness.  - abdominal cramping.  - missed or late period  Mostly the above occur between 2 - 4 weeks after conception. There are other stronger symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue that may follow in the next one month. There may also be some implantation bleeding in some women, not all.    Do remember that everyone's body reacts differently and some can't make out until even 2 months! Also, many of these symptoms are similar to what you have before periods also.    A better way is to take a HPT and the surest is to take a blood test, both of which will have to wait for several days if you think you conceived recently. I know what is like trying to find a symptom, but I just had to wait it out when I got pregnant.

I had a regular period on June 6, 2008 and everything was normal.

Turned out my son was conceived around May 20th and I still had my regular period. So I wouldn't suggest waiting for your "missed" period if you want to know, because you may not miss one at all...at least a missed period wasn't one of my symptoms of pregnancy.    Your best bet is to go to the doctor and have a blood test done. Good luck and I hope everything works out the way you want it to!|`|e6h4RX4laa	first symptom is your peroid wont occur..  then u will have headache.vomitting|`|LKIhUMCgaa	the earliest u can have pregnancy symptoms is 1 week after conception, which would start as spotting and cramping due to implantation, which happens within 6-12 days after conception, u can also have tender breasts. those 3 r most common symptoms. usually headaches and morning sickness doesn't start till u're around 4 weeks pregnant. some women don't get any symptoms at all though.
geMRkVJbaa	I find the femur measurement is usually the most inaccurate of all the 4 used to date at this stage of pregnancy. I personally think it's because there is such a wide range of 'normal'. You think about it, people usually have roughly the same size head and abdomen (if they are not overweight), but height varies vastly, both between and within different ethnic groups. If I get a short femur length I look at the parents - usually one or both of them is below average height. Bottom line is, what you describe is to small a discrepancy to worry about.|`|nFj30sZcaa	I don't think you should be worried about anything. It could be a number of things - ultrasound tech measured incorrectly, etc. My ultrasound at 19 weeks showed some measurements coming up at 18 weeks and one at 21 weeks, the doctor said everything looked good.  I don't think it's something you should stress over.|`|hlztyMYyaa	dont worry too much call your dr if you need to|`|w90rEAADaa	dont worry all babies grow at different speeds.  nothing to be worried about.|`|96ydDKocaa	i think its way to early to freak out they are estamating the age they may do a few more ultra sounds to do more in depth measurements they couldnt find the fingers in most of my ultra sounds but my son was born with all 10 fingers you may just have a small baby if your really concerned call your doc she may be able to ease your fears over the phone good luck to you!|`|QaHp9ryPaa	because it FL is 4 days smaller then average you think there is a serious problem? Relax momma everything sounds just fine and you just sound a bit paranoid. Everyone is always concerned about their baby. Relax and try to enjoy being pregnant! Stress is good for nothing!
XujomifIaa	Well I'm 32 wks pregnant with my second baby and this pregnancy is nothing like my first. I found out I was pregnant with my first baby at 4wks and with this baby I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was about 4 months pregnant. And I was having my period until my fifth month being pregnant. So if I were you I'd wait a lil bit more then go and get a pregnancy test done at the clinic. So good luck...|`|VClxXNs3aa	I felt my baby kicking at 16 weeks with  1 and now at 13 weeks I am feeling some....|`|eya1WDS4aa	there is no way you would be able to feel the baby move now. if you where pregnant you wouldnt even be a month along. sorry.
4kQxbFZTaa	wow bud.  So according to your other questions, your a gay male, but your in love with your female cousin, and you seem to have a pretty heavy obsession with sex.  Maybe you should just chill out.  Try reading a book or something.  maybe start with fairy tales and whatnot and work your way up.  Your spelling leaves a little something to be desired pal.    Now, to answer your question:    If you start nailing your cousin, your parents are likely going to be pissed.  Even if you are adopted.  There are lots of women in the world, and while it may be easy to get close to a family member you will end up causing a lot of pain.  Weigh the options.  You know your family.  Are they open minded?  If not, maybe you should just chill.  Your going to do what your going to do either way, but really, I mean your cousin?   Lots of other women.  Likely not worth it.  How old are you?    P.S.-  there is a dandy tool called the spell checker.  You should really check it out sometime.  Makes people seem as though they might not be retarded even if they are.  I'm not referring to you or anything because that would just be rude.  I'm not a rude guy.  Just try it next time.    P.P.S.  you might want to try talking to a youth counselor in your area.  Asking questions like this online is really just going to get you ridiculed and if this is really causing you angst, which it seems to be because this is the third time you have asked the same question, you need to talk it out.  Try kids help phone.  According to other questions you may be having problems defining your sexuality and this can lead to depression without consulting a professional.  Best of luck pal.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'd say get your family's blessing and then proceed from there....|`|FEzmVmFjaa	A few days ago you just asked how you go about telling your family you're gay.  Get a life.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	tell her she is like family to you.And speak to an older friend about it.  i say : Dont do that    god bless|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you aren't blood related it's not incest nor is it illegal.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	lol wow a troll...wut is it w/ u and all these sex questions?|`|NLxcfGplaa	Little kids can be so annoying.|`|19HagxpZaa	Ask your parents first.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	Probably not a good idea.  Isn't there anyone else around that you could choose from that's not related??    --throwing up in mouth--|`|eya1WDS4aa	Talk to your parents. and taken that you cant spell cousin im guessing your in your early teens. I would really wait until your older to have sex. It can lead to pregnancy, stds and not just the ones you can get ride of it can lead to  aids and herpes which are for life. Really please wait to have sex.|`|w3YPjPGAaa	Buddy, your questions are contradictory  Get a life|`|yuwjQjKqaa	If you are gay (like you said you were in your last question) then why do you like her?|`|XflZjhaXaa	Whether your blood related or not, you said she's your cousin. That means that regardless of DNA you are family. You do NOT have sex with your family!! You seem very young, you have plenty of time to meet great girls,that are not related to you.|`|tFC13Xsgaa	go for it man  i wish you all the luck|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	Alright Before any one answers this please read his other Questions...|`|PRKv5Zgraa	just because you like each other and aren't blood relatives doesn't mean you should run out and have sex. and you don't sound like you're over 18.    if you do, use a condom, for christ's sake....and why is this question in the pregnancy section?|`|R31uLQvTaa	Wow.. Read his profile.|`|AA11993635	so you like your cousin whos a girl and you are a guy but you're gay? i read your other questions... you must be a complete idiot!
aQe7gKznaa	no    make a break for it kid!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She can't be if it's a normal period. If she is bleeding a normal to heavy flow then NO she is not pregnant. Women do not get a period in pregnancy because that is when your body sheds the uterine lining. If you shed your uterine lining during pregnancy you would miscarry.     Some women BLEED during pregnancy but the bleeding is never a moderate to heavy flow. It's usually a light flow or spotting that the woman confuses as a strange period because she is bleeding.|`|UAunAKdtaa	nah. a lot of us girls get our periods late... its normal to get one anywere between 3 days early or 4 days late or something like that. if she got her period today, then there is no possibility she could be pregnant, especially if you guys had sex just a few days earlier.( imean like 3 days, not 2 weeks). a girl is more likely to get pregnant between her periods like on the 15th day after her period, but once she is about 5 days before the period, there os less and less possibliltes. she cant be pregnant and on her period. thats called miscacrriage if she ever was pregnant before.|`|2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	She can not have her period and be pregnant.  No possible way.  A period is the process of the uterine lining being shed along with the unfertilized egg.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	It's possible she is pregnant but not likely.  Since she was only 3 days late I and then got her period I wouldn't worry about it.  If you are both still concerned she could always take a pregnancy test just to be sure.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	No!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	what u're reading bout is called Decidual Bleeding, it's not an actual period, although it might seem like one. yes, some women bleed during their pregnancy, but it's due to their hormones being unstable causing them loose parts of the lining of their uterus.    EDIT: people are wrong bout the bleeding being lighter, when a woman bleeds during her pregnancy, it can be the same as her regular period, lighter, or even heavier, it all depends on her hormones.|`|GSZGmH14aa	It is possible but unlikely. Ask if its a lighter flow than normal or if it is a pinkish brown color instead of red. If so. you may have a baby...|`|FufV5aZNaa	It's not really all that common but of course there are alway exceptions. Buy her a pg test and then you'll know for sure.|`|EgeId6TKaa	It sounds gross, but if she has a normal "flow" of blood, then she is not pregnant. Some pregnant women experience spotting where there is very little blood, but it doesn't sound to me like your girlfriend is pregnant.|`|tMK190xaaa	it is RARE but some women can still get their period but i wouldn't freak out about it until there is something to freak out about.   have protected sex and you won't have to worry. good luck|`|CAfpMvmgaa	she's not pregnant unless there's NO blood! but it could also be her hormones freaking out...|`|R31uLQvTaa	Its pretty hard to determine with out some more details. But, to be sure buy her a pregnancy test to find out. Periods could just be late also because of stress. Good Luck!|`|AA11315360	If she has a normal period then NO she is NOT pregnant. What you must have read is that if a woman has a little bleeding she could be pregnant. But if she is having a normal period for 3 to 7 days then she is NOT pregnant.  Always use condoms and get her to take birth control pills.|`|ZRgLHW3maa	you can still have a period and be pregnant. I had a period for the first 2 months that I was pregnant|`|jxKQqbC9aa	no shes not|`|in8QyeVnaa	no. unless she is miscarrying.although she may have another type of vaginal bleeding.      Many women report having their period while pregnant, but typically this is not the case. The reason why this cannot be is that pregnancy and menstruation cannot take place at the same time, by the very definition of the two. If you were pregnant and you began menstruating you would inevitably lose the pregnancy, or have a miscarriage. While you cannot have your period and continue to be pregnant at the same time you can experience vaginal bleeding and continue to be pregnant. It is often this vaginal bleeding that women believe is their menstrual cycle when it is not.|`|P6wtA5hCaa	Actually, there have been some rare cases where a female will still bleed come her period time and not dislodge the little egg up inside her. So, stay tuned. :)|`|daH1hoJ2aa	more then likely she is "not" sometimes you can be late because of nerves..   if you are nerveous still take a pregnancy test.. but i'm sure you guys are ok|`|iRfO9MIPaa	It's possible but I would say she isn't.  Be more careful next time!|`|sm89EL4caa	My last period was June 6, 2008 and seemed completely normal. Around June 18th or so I started feeling really weird. I decided I'd take a pregnancy test just out of curiosity and it came back positive. I took 4 more just to be sure and they all were. When I had my first doctors visit I explained to him that I had just had a period on June 6th. Turned out my son was conceived around May 20th and I still had what I thought was my regular period. If you both feel uncertain I would just go to your local health department and have a blood test done.
AA11757354	I'd like to warn you that my opinion about abortion is based on reason, and very few people approach the abortion debate using reason. For most people, it's an emotional debate fueled by guilt. The emotions on the issue tend to run so deeply most people forget which is which. So I do apologize for any hurt feelings which result from my dealing with abortion reasonably.    I support a woman's right to have control over their reproductive capacity. Abortion does not affect citizens (a person is not a citizen until they are born) or the intrinsic assets of the nation, so there is no legislative basis for there to be any laws taking rights away from a citizen (the pregnant woman)    Furthermore, abortion is not murder. Murder is the willful taking of one human's life by another human. I've seen pictures, and the fetus might look vaguely human, but physiologically a fetus is more like a salamander than a human. I know that sounds harsh, but there's also a degree to which deep down you know that it's true.    Neurologically, the child isn't complete until it's a year old, and continues developing for about 25 years. So while it's still in the womb, it's certainly not a developed human. It's a part of our natural development for the brain to be undeveloped at birth because otherwise the head could never have fit through the opening.     I asked the question "What makes humans distinct from other animals?" I received many interesting answers: The awareness that we are different from other animals, the ability to make rational decisions, the ability to suppress our animal nature, the ability to conceptualize good and evil, large brains, the ability to create art, the ability to question one's existence, speech, self improvement, and so on. At a glance, it's fairly obvious that a fetus does not have any of these qualities. In doing further research, I came across this website which I strongly recommend: http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?id=162    A fetus has the potential of becoming human, but being human is a very special thing. It's more than just a matter of our genetic make-up. It's about the way we think. Without the way we think, we are like any other animal.     Given that most people believe in the existence of a soul, It becomes an issue to consider when a person gets a soul. If you believe that only humans have souls, then the fetus doesn't have one because it's not yet human. It has the potential to become human, but it's not there yet. If you believe that all creatures have souls, then it goes to wherever souls go. If you believe in Karma, then that life served a purpose which it was there to do and can karmically celebrate that it's life accomplished what it was destined to accomplish.    Don't get me wrong, I don't want anyone to think that I'm advocating killing babies. Babies are cute and respond well to people, kinda like puppies, and I am also opposed to killing puppies. In fact I have often been very supportive of all things child related and puppy related. But when it comes right down to it, and we consider the neural biology, certain facts become apparent. But I want to make it very clear that I am in no way advocating infanticide, which is much nicer than the bible which doesn't even mention infanticide despite the fact that it was commonly practiced at the time. In fact, until about a hundred years ago, I can't recall this ever having been much of an issue ever in the history of the world. But now, as infant mortality rates are at an all time low, and population is soaring out of control, now is the time in human evolution when people decide to stand up and say that abortion is wrong.    Christians claim to take truth from the bible, and the bible makes no reference to abortion or infanticide. In fact the closest thing to a reference is in Exodus 21:22 to the punishment if a man does violence to a pregnant woman causing her to lose the child, which is different from the punishment for murder as described in Exodus 21:12, which clearly indicates that the basis for popular religious thought for the Judeo-Christian-Muslim traditions did not intend for the killing of a fetus to be regarded as murder. But this is a religious view point, and not a secular viewpoint, so it out not have any influence over the law.    I know there is a lot in here which some people will react against, because I'm dealing with the topic frankly, openly and head on. That's not the way people usually deal with the abortion debate. They hide behind images of something cute and say, "It's a defenseless innocent human, how could you kill it." I have learned that it's generally a good idea to to be wary of people who's only rationale is guilt. I'm not hiding behind any feeling based arguments but instead dealing with the actual issues. Feelings are too easily manipulated. Just ask anyone who works in marketing. But the facts are the facts and when people get over their feelings on the issue and stop listening to people trying to retain their positions and relevance by convincing people that this is actually a reasonable issue, then maybe we could move on and deal with all the real issues which we were distracted from because of this bogus abortion debate. Like for instance, why is it that there have been major advances in everything for the past 50 years, but we're still stuck with the same corrupt politicians?|`|AA11258207	I defiently think that abortion is wrong. it is sorta like murder, and stops a beating heart. The kid could grow up to be like the next president or something!!|`|AA12340831	i strongly agree that abortion is wrong, if you really dont want the baby give it up for adoption.|`|AA11863273	I hate to be controversial but I think its a choice that you can never fully understand or make any kind of condemnation of until you have walked a mile in each woman's shoes.    In certain situations I think it can be the wisest option, and sweeping statements like its wrong, the end, do nothing to help women who are in an awful predicament.|`|AA11827424	I'm basically pro-life. But not all abortions are created equal. I can understand why a teenager may be terrified of wasting her life, or a woman with bad heredity might not wish to bear a defective child. I would not hold it against them that they acted on fear. On the other hand, most abortions come too easily. Abortion is not birth control, nor a question of convenience. Having a child is always an inconvenience, and nobody is ever quite prepared for it. All in all, I believe it's better to prevent than remedy.|`|AA12058912	its the mothers decision, everyone else should stay out of it. with the exception of possably the father.|`|AA12289340	I think it is a woman's choice.. It great to think that if you do accidentally get pregnant that you can just give your child up for adoption and some great family will adopt him/her and they will live happily ever after.  But that's not always the case, there are so many kids who are being passed from one foster home to another and when you think about it wouldn't it have been better for them if the mother would have just had an abortion??  If you can't afford to have a child, don't have one...|`|AA10580726	I think it wrong because you are ending a life. With the widespread availability of birth control there really should not be any accidents. Unplanned pregnancy happens when people are being irresponsible, and someone should not die for someone else's irresponsibility. Also, there are so many people who wait years to adopt a newborn, if someone really cant take care of the baby there are people who will pay for all of your medical care, living expenses while you are pregnant, and family counseling and legal fees for the adoption. You can pick who the parents are, and even whether you want to be a part of the childs life or not. There are so many options, why kill the baby. Even  the government and insurance companies recognize it as life, they pay for fetal surgeries. To some life is so precious, if it is not the same to you then give it to someone who will celebrate it. The only instance in which an abortion should be performed is when the mothers life is at stake.|`|AA12112224	I think it depends on the situation. like if you were raped. I don't care what anyone says you are not going to want to carry that baby for 9 months!! or if your life is in danger. but other than that, you Prevent the pregnancy with birth control instead of using abortion as a birth control|`|AA10789506	I think it is wrong for so many reasons.  One, the woman who wants to abort her baby made the CHOICE to have sex, unless she was raped.  Anytime you have unprotected sex, there is a chance you can become pregnant.  Two, the unborn baby's heart begins to beat not long after conception.  How can a tiny human being with a beating heart not be alive?  Therefore, abortion is murder.|`|AA11132557	its wrong for me, & it should be banned. but its not like i can stop it, so in my opinion if i do get pregnant, & im not ready i would still keep it. i rathr have my mom get mad at me than to kill ur own innocent baby. i know these babies has proly not recollection while they are still a fetus but it will have a life one day & it sucks wen that is taken away from them. totally sad. im just against abortion.|`|AA10374197	it is wrong, wrong, wrong.   So many people in the world think it is a form of birth control or something.   That my body my choice crap doesn't cut it either.  It stopped being just your body the minute the baby was concieved.         I am a very pro life and christian.  I used to clean up at an abortion clinic............it's horrible some of the methods used and what those poor babies go through.  You don't want to know what we found in the trash that should have never been there .............and not they were not supposed to have been putting them in there.   And yes I was young and when I realized what I was working in I never went back.      The bible tells us that God knew us even before we were in our mother's womb.   They are not just fetuses .......they are tiny humans.......yes even the ones made out of wed lock.      There are sooooo many many people unable to have babies who would take babies and raise them in loving homes........there is no need for abortion.
AA11483216	You sound very young. It depends on a lot of things, whether it will hurt or not.  And that's just the physical part. You could be in for a lot of heartbreak if you're having sex too soon. Grow up a little bit more.|`|AA12028474	it hurts to loose ur virginity|`|AA11944878	you should wait til you are married.|`|AA12225257	It hurts more than just physically - it also hurts emotionally. Why don't you wait til you are married. Then it will be a special & tender experience for both of you. That way if it hurts (which it will) he can be MORE understanding and comfort you the way you deserve to be comforted.|`|AA11687024	Hurts real bad if you are not married don't do it.|`|AA12280360	it does hurt a little and feels like a pinch and then goes away.|`|969948bff0db818e6e48deb9cb4eb193aa	yah it hurts. it all depends on how big the guy is. the pain isnt that bad and it goes away after a minute or two. it well worth it.
5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	It could possibly be implantation bleeding, but that wouldn't account for your abbreviated cycle last month. Your best bet would be to go to the doctor and get tested. It seems that stressing, which most females do when actively trying to conceive, can cause your menstrual cycle to do wacky things and trick you into believing you're pregnant when you aren't. Wait a few day and take a test or go to your Ob/Gyn. Hope this is the month for you. If not, relax enjoy trying ;-) and it'll happen soon. Good luck|`|AA11966568	That can just mean that you are getting your periods earlier this month...implantation bleeding is usually dark brown or pink in  colour and not red.|`|AA10718646	It could be implantation bleeding but it also could be your period changing...I would wait a week after you should have your period and take a pregnancy test...if it comes up negative go get a pap smear with a HPV test.|`|830247e6ffdad09895c800246dd85b9daa	go see your ob/gyn asap

f7986950c8bcae44550dda0b7d896ecbaa	No, I don't think that you're over 5 weeks. Thin people tend to show earlier than not-so-thin people because they don't have as much to hide it. Still 5 weeks is early to be showing considering your baby is the size of a pea.  Really the only way to find out how far along you are is to have an ultra sound.      When you say "eating a lot" do you mean healthy food, fruit, veggies, whole grains, or do you mean what ever you hungry for, like junk food?  It is very important to be eating a healthy diet, not only for the baby, but for you. If you aren't eating the nutrients that the baby needs, then he/she will start taking the nutrients it needs from your bones and your body.  A good source of info is www.parents.com . Good luck!|`|06b511b827ef1f0bc05751a7464e8829aa	It is likely that you Ovulated some time around june 3/4, so you probably concieved around there, implantation would have likely taken place some time between the 12th and the 15th.     Doctors count from the last LMP, but you dont really get pregnant then.    Appetite increase is normal, try to avoid white flour, and sugar as much as possible, check out the Brewer Pregnancy Diet for some exc. info. Healthy mothers and healthy pregnancies make for healthy birth giving to healthy babies.      You are not showing yet- perhaps a bit bloated? make sure you are taking a good quality vitamin, the best, I think, is Professional Prenatal Formula by Life Time, nonprescription!    May I suggest a midwife? CNM for hospital or birth center or a CM, CPM if you would prefer to have your birth at home.     All the Best!|`|a5f2699cb389d7d8e0054e987ac1da63aa	I was very thin with my daughter and I didn't start showing till I was almost 3 months I believe it depends on each person.  I got pregnant in April and I have pictures of me in June and you cant even tell I was pregnant.  As long as you are eating well that's all that matters.  I did eventually gain allot of weight (50 lbs) and did start to show.  Just be patient, eat well and get a sonogram done to know exactly when you are do. =0) Congrats.|`|1b030f80d91eada74b6dd27de1e8f2a9aa	If your date is correct, the dr will pull our a little dial, and tell you that you are 5 weeks and 6 days with a due date of Feb 22nd 2007. The only change to this would be if they do an ultrasound and the baby measures differently than the date you gave. It is 40 weeks from the start of you LMP|`|AA10733221	You need to see your doctor for an exam to make sure everything is OK; he can best tell you how far along you are.  As for the eating, that's normal for a pregnant woman, just watch what you eat and you'll be just fine.|`|AA12354853	go to the doctor and have it checked. no one will give u a better estimate of how far along u are.  congratulations! :)|`|AA12212766	wow is this your 1rst and if so probably a couple months! congrats on the baby!|`|5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	You're probably 5 weeks. Some people just gain weight easily and this earlier a lot of pregnant women bloat, as they do when their cycle is due so you're probably just bloated and appear to be showing a little. Doubt you're farther and definitely not baby this early. Congrats and good luck on another 35 weeks :-)|`|AA12058912	OK if your last period started on may 18 and your cycle is 35 days you should have gotten your period on June 22 right? that means you ovulated on June 8 (you ovulate 14 days before the first day of your cycle)    that would make three weeks sense you actually conceived  but pregnancy is always counted form the first day of your last period so you are almost 6 weeks pregnant (thats why some women tend to go past there due date because the estimate on how long they have been pregnant is wrong)    if you want to look at how your baby is developing I would look at week 5 not 6 because your cycle is 7 days longer than "normal"    ok so that being said and explained you should not be showing yet, the baby is the size of a grain of rice, and you require no extra calories at this point of your pregnancy. but you are probly retaining fluid or be constipated and may appear bloated. you could also be over eating and gaining fat, but not baby yet.|`|5d17111cd12c570c65d2e1936b75338daa	NO MOST OF US EAT FOR TWO SO THEREFORE THERE WILL BE A WEIGHT GAIN AUTOMATICALLY

AA11152050	It is the torture women have to go through every month to prove they are a woman!!! LOL! Really, it is when a woman's unfertilized egg leaves her body. It isn't a fun thing for most women to go through because it causes cramps, back pain, headaches, cravings(usually chocolate) and alot of other uncomfortable things.|`|09f9daa856881d1e0c6fa9356508b118aa	A period is really called a Menstrual Cycle: and this is what it is:      What is menstruation?   Menstruation is a woman's monthly bleeding. It is also called menses, menstrual period, or period. When a woman has her period, she is menstruating. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus (womb). It flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days.     What is the menstrual cycle?   Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle, which helps a woman's body prepare for the possibility of pregnancy each month. A cycle starts on the first day of a period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. However, a cycle can range anywhere from 23 days to 35 days.     The parts of the body involved in the menstrual cycle include the brain, pituitary gland, uterus and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina. Body chemicals called hormones rise and fall during the month and make the menstrual cycle happen. The ovaries make two important female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Other hormones involved in the menstrual cycle include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), made by the pituitary gland.     What happens during the menstrual cycle?   In the first half of the menstrual cycle, levels of estrogen rise and make the lining of the uterus grow and thicken. In response to follicle-stimulating hormone, an egg (ovum) in one of the ovaries starts to mature. At about day 14 of a typical 28-day cycle, in response to a surge of luteinizing hormone, the egg leaves the ovary. This is called ovulation.     In the second half of the menstrual cycle, the egg begins to travel through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Progesterone levels rise and help prepare the uterine lining for pregnancy. If the egg becomes fertilized by a sperm cell and attaches itself to the uterine wall, the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg is not fertilized, it either dissolves or is absorbed into the body. If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the uterus is shed during the menstrual period.     In the illustration below, an egg has left an ovary after ovulation and is on its way through a fallopian tube to the uterus.|`|aad47fa01b974d8620677fcfa32e8d12aa	a period is what only girl have. guys dont have periods.once girls get to the age like 11-18 thats when a girl starts to have a period and the period is blood that comes a out body and thats why the stores sell PADS  or TAMPAX. pads is like a thick pading and its sticky at the bottom of it and we placed them in our underwear but guys be careful when you have sex with a girl and shes on her period and you can develupe sperm use protection! cuz you can get her PREGNET. but theirs a cycle when the period starts girls get there period at the begining of the month then it ends at the end of the month then maybe a week later it starts agian. but once girls get older and becoming woman then once they get like 50 it ends for good!|`|0a181d6e420016c2a5b56b76c626b26eaa	go to www.gurl.com  or www.teenwire.com those might help|`|3223df70eaf47d34107e728c326fd9adaa	it is when a girl has blood coming out of her Virgina.......|`|AA11355733	BLOOD COMES OUT OF THE GIRLS VAGINA FOR AROUND 5-7 DAYS!!AND U EITHER HAVE TO WEAR A PAD OR TAMPON!!|`|AA12043893	a period is when a woman sheds blood and uterine lining for 7 days or more or less when an egg isn't fertilized.|`|AA10011571	um...you should've learned this in school?    if not...check it up on Wikipedia or some other sex-ed site|`|f8a41312e779e5a8179dcb22a45bf25caa	go to http://www.teenhealth.org|`|AA10614322	blood coming out of a gurls body!

Best of luck to you!! ~Bon|`|AA11236050	The doctor will write them out or a health department will give them to you.    You should take them at night if you can if they make you sick like they did me. I couldn't take them after the 3rd pill cause it would make me so sick i would throw up but my child was born healthy anyhow. I really see no point in taking them cause what did people do back in the day when they were pregnant..    Good luck|`|AA11407601	Start taking them as soon as possible-even before getting pregnant or as soon as you know you are. The first trimester is especially important as you need to take folic acid to reduce the chances of any mental or physical deformities with your fetus. You can get them without a prescription from any pharmacy-just look in the vitamin aisle.|`|AA10179875	Actually it is a good idea to start taking them prior to conceiving. And if you are pg I would take them everyday, even when they make you wanna hurl.  You and your baby need the extra vitamins.    Don't listen to the first answer, back in the day what did people do?  Have more still births, miscarriages, and deaths giving birth.|`|AA12117213	You can start taking as soon as you decide if you are going to try to get pregnant.|`|92b6d0a89c4598c0a9c5047694f646dbaa	If you are pregnant, or trying to conceive , your doctor will write a prescription for you.  However, I have noticed that some grocery stores make their own versions.  Prenatal vitamins are just a really good multi vitamin.  It is recommended that you take them shortly before getting pregnant, during your pregnancy , and awhile afterward.  Good luck!|`|171d77d93e22f79a3f8275793caaa1d8aa	If you are pregnant you need to start taking them, and also start seeing a Dr.    You can get them anywhere they sell vitamins. Wal-mart, any of the drug stores, Health Dept., the the doctor can give you a prescription for them. The over the counter ones are just as good as the prescription vitamins.|`|a66246a0b674fb1f58fd7f403463073caa	Prenatal Vitamins are essential unless you get ALL of your needed vitamins in the food that you already eat (which is quite difficult for most people).  You especially need Folic Acid in your diet/vitamins for the prenatal time to drastically reduce the chance of problems with the baby.  Ideally, you should start taking prenatal vitamins 3 months before conceiving.  Or as soon as possible if you are currently pregnant.  You can find them in any grocery store, drug store, or from your doctor.|`|31c054309411b467c40e6c761960359eaa	You should start taking them as soon as possible. You can buy them at any drug store.

They help reduce the chances of certain birth defects. Thay are also good for you. You can buy them at any drug store. When you go to the Dr, he can also give you a prescription for them. If they make you sick, try taking them with meals or with some milk. Usually its the iron in them that causes this and the Dr can prescribe them with low iron.|`|AA12250454	Your doctor will write you a prescription for them. But you can get them at any drug store. Start taking them as soon as possible. Yes, they are essential, to you and your baby. When I was pregnant I didn't get enough calcium and it completely destroyed some of my teeth. The baby took most of my calcium and kinda left me drained.|`|AA12216284	You can start taking them before you even get pregnant.  Essential?  Hard to say - if you eat a balanced diet and are in good health you may be okay - if you don't have any preexisting health conditions or congenital ones that could be passed onto the baby then it may be fine.  Some times the vitamins are beneficial but can cause more problems with constipation and nausea which when your pregnant isn't fun.  Your body will take nutrients that you already have stored and give it to your baby first in the end you will be the one that really needs the nutrients more then. My mother and grandmother used to tell me that they didn't take any vitamins when they were having kids and this is from the 30's to the 60's so that would be something to think about.|`|AA11542946	you should start taking them as soon as you know your pregnant and can see a doctor to give you a prescription.....they are very essential to you and your baby....one good thing about them is that they actually help your baby's brain to develop better.....you can also go to most drug stores and ask the advice of a pharmacist about which prenatal vitamin is good over the counter....not only are they good for your baby but they have benefits for you too...they can make your fingernails grow and your hair also...if you were like me and couldn't seem to grow nails...and also i've been trying to grow my hair for a while and when I was taking the vitamins, they made my hair grow......and actually my hair is still growing good and i've stopped the vitamins since my son was born and he's 2 now! SO GOOD LUCK AND TAKE YOUR VITAMINS!

At the stage you are in it could still be hours or even days. If it is your first child it is more likely that you are going to take longer, if this is your second child it will likely be faster than your first and if this is your third or more, they can go longer or shorter again for some reason.    I had to be induced at a week late so labour was not days long but it wasn't a couple hours either. I went about 12 hours altogether.

Definitivamente para tu caso, lo mejor que pudiste haber hecho (de forma casi inmediata), es haber comprado anticonceptivos de emergencia, los cuales son muy efectivos y hay muchos en el mercado, pero los que te puedo recomendar son: Ovral (aunque pueden producir un poco de malestar como nauceas y vmito) o bien Postinor (de una sola toma), este es menos agresivo y por lo mismo con menos efectos secundarios, pero igual de eficaz. NOTA SUPER IMPORTANTE: Los anticonceptivos de emergencia, NO deben ser tomados cando ya pasaron MAS de 72 hrs. por que es entonces cuando favorecen el embarazo, ya que contienen progestgenos, lo cual como su nombre lo indica, funcionan en PRO de la GESTACION.    Recuerden que el rgano ergeno ms grande del cuerpo humano, es la piel y tambien hay muchas otras formas de tener placer y hasta orgasmos, sin necesidad de un coito. Existen muchas posibilidades que no implican riego de Embarazo, aunque con esto no necesariamente quiero decir que se eliminen las posibilidades de obtener una infeccin, ya sea viral, bacteriana o mictica. Que les parece como ejemplo el sexo oral, el cual lo hay en varias presentaciones: Fellatio (boca-pene), cunilingus (boca-vagina) y anilingus (boca-ano).

Cuando un hombre esta muy exitado, su pene segrega una peque?a cantidad de una sustancia con una cantidad muy peque?a de espermas, este sirve como lubricante. Este lquido se llama lquido pre-eyaculatorio.    Si estas gotas de la sustacia llegan a tener contacto con la vagina es muy probable que la mujer se embarace.    Es mejor usar un preservativo, aunque solo sean juegos previos al coito.

ff95baf419a5897fdd1b8f5f636db3f3aa	I have had this procedure done four times, and it is no big deal. In all actuality, it is a ring they put around your cervix, at least that is what Dr told me.  All it does is prevent the cervix from opening before it is time. If you are going to have natural childbirth, they will remove it before delivery to allow nature to take its course.  It is a same day procedure, and there is little or no pain.  It has helped me make it through four difficult pregnancies.  Good luck to you.  I hope all goes well.|`|65e5fb0e28b24b578fca0b59be2f300baa	When a womans cervix is weak (sometimes called an incompetent cervix) she is more likely to have a baby born prematurely because the cervix shortens or opens too early. In order to prevent premature labor, a womans doctor may recommend a cerclage be placed. A cerclage is used to prevent these early changes in a womans cervix thus preventing premature labor. A closed cervix helps a developing baby stay inside the uterus until the mother reaches 37-38 weeks of pregnancy|`|787648923ad625d99f0f2b683607bbb0aa	I myself haven't gone through the experienced but a good friend of mine did.

It's just surgical netting that the Doc sews over your cervix, or he just just uses a few stiches (think draw string bag being closed tight). It's just a way to stop your cervix from opening up to early. It has a very high success rate, is a one day procedure (in and out of the Hospital or his office in a few hours), and it has no bad side effects for you or your baby.    Best of luck sweety, give that cute one a kiss from me when he/she gets here.|`|e018098a755241807a24e21cb00d4466aa	Got me; I don't have a cervix|`|AA12212360	Cervical sutures are pretty straight forward  we put them in in second trimester under a light General anasthetic it takes 5 minutes.

Um atraso de 18 dias j pode ser acusado pelo betaHCG em caso de gravidez.Pe?a pra ela fazer o exame , assim acaba a dvida. E daqui pra frente, se eu posso te dar um conselho n?o confie apenas na camisinha. Compre uma cartela de anticoncepcional que ela deve tomar o primeiro comprimido no 5o dia aps o incio da menstrua??o de preferncia sempre no mesmo horrio .A eficcia  100% e vocs n?o passam mais esse tipo de susto|`|78971a2f7c458e786dec1101a54c8843aa	Calma, cara espera nascer.

Conheci uma mulher e j ouvi algumas histrias de que a mulher mesmo grvida menstroa no primeiro, segundo e as vezes at no terceiro ms. mas para tirar todas as duvidas procure um mdico de sua confian?a ou dela. Testes de farmcia  fria, conversando com o medico alm de ver se ela esta grvida ou n?o poder tirar varias duvidas sobre o assunto.

A plula do dia seguinte tem eficcia de 90% se tomada logo aps o ato..porm ela  indicada at 78 horas aps o ato...isso , 3 dias. Que  o tempo que um esperma sobrevive dentro de voc e o suficiente pra fecundar.  Esse negcio de 120 horas  furada.  E o fato de vc tomar as duas de uma vez, perde mais ainda a eficcia da pilula.  Tome cuidado com auto medica??o, pricipalmente com a pilula do dia seguinte, ela tem o valor de uma cartela inteira de anticoncepcional.  Agora  torcer pra n?o estar grvida. E da prxima vez procure usar outros mtodos, e caso precise da pilula do dia seguinte tente tomar o mais rpido possivel..lembrando que  at 78 horas e n?o 120.  Um bj?o  P.S. estou escrevendo isso pq uma vez precisei tomar a ginecologista me falou tudo isso que to te falando....

Qualquer coisa vc faz aquele exame de gravidez que tira sague.   um exame barato uns 30 reais +-.  se voc tiver um dia de gravidez ja d pra detectar.  muito melhor que os de farmacia.  Agora mesmo com 5 dias voc tem chace de perder mas n?o  confiavel.  Boa sorte.|`|20e05d3e2834dfbd78a981bdeff2ea20aa	Lindinha,    Estes supostos sintomas podem variar de pessoa para pessoa, estando grvida ou n?o.    O melhor que vc tem a fazer  procurar um mdico e se orientar para os exames e procedimentos a serem feitos.     Ninguem aqui pode te dar uma resposta exata sobre isso.|`|b802c8d9931639aca9260f2548450d18aa	sei l meu, acho que f*deu!|`|d9c6c2ccb32e0b3a59357ff7272a9804aa	N?o  porque voc n?o teve efeitos colaterais que n?o fez efeito. Minha namorada j tomou, na mesma situa??o que voc e n?o teve nenhum efeito colateral, pelo contrrio,  raro dar efeito colateral nas mulheres. E gra?as a Deus minha namorada n?o ficou grvida. Nem te preocupa, que o efeito t garantido.
