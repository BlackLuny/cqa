20090203114216AAnVDrb	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Sex before marriage? Should you old out until wedding night even if you guys have slept together?	For example, my fiance live together, have a son and are currently expecting. However, I told him that I didn't want to have sex a month before the wedding. Does that make sense to try and wait for our wedding night? Your opinions please.    I know it sounds kind of dumb
20090203114345AAoJgfM	Family & Relationships;Family	Mending a sister/mother relationship?	My sister has not talked to my mother for the past 3 years. There was a blowout involving our mother trying to bring up the fact that she knows that her son is gay and that it doesn't change how she thinks of him. My sister seems to be in denial about this, but also there is an issue about a sort-of abuse that happened in the past. My sister's stepfather put a hole in a wall and would watch them shower. My mother found out and kicked him out of the house, but let him back in. I just recently spoke with my sister, and realized that she is still hurt deeply, and blames my mother for not protecting her. She says she hates her and never wants to see her again. I understand where her pain is coming from, but I'm not sure if she realizes that even though our mother has made bad decisions and says terrible things that she doesn't realize, that her intentions are good and that she loves her. I really don't know what to do, because I see my mother in tears from not being able to speak to her daughter. My sister sees it like she is the only one in the family holding her accountable for her actions. I'm sad about this on both sides. Is there anything I can do?

20090203115555AApkgRq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How am I supposed to get through to him ... wrong roommate - PLEASE HELP!?	My boyfriend of 2 years and I finally have enough money saved up to look for a place. I don't have a job at the moment so he would be the one paying his half of the rent 'till I find a job. Well there's a guy we know who was a non-rent paying, mooching, not paying for anything, loud, drunk and taking the car without asking while drunk of the people he was living with, a married couple. He never looked for a job and lived with them for 7 months! Didn't pay a dime for anything the whole time.      Well he finally got his unemployment check but the married couple is moving out of the apartment. This guy is trying to get his name on the lease when they move out and find a roommate to pay half the rent along with him. And my boyfriend wants to be the roommate. He said he will look for a job as soon as his unemployment runs out. Not a good idea. I saw the stress and anger he put my married couple friends through while they lived with him and I know this is not a good idea.       While the wife was pregnant a few months ago he caused her so much stress that she miscarried. Now I know I don't have that much say in this 'cause my boyfriend will be the one paying for everything, but I'm currently working my butt off looking for work and I will have one soon I'm sure of it. And I do have some say, I'm pretty much his wife.       I know living with this guy won't work ... my boyfriend goes bed at 7:00 at night and goes to work at 3:00 in the morning 6 days a week and this guy gets drunk all the time and is very loud constantly. When he drinks, he's a huge jerk to women. I've seen it, he has 0 respect for that kind of thing or women. The apartment is $700 a month but there's several other apartments in our area for that ammount and cheaper!       He seems so set on trying to move in with this guy! It's not going to work and he'll treat me like garbage when my boyfriend isn't there, go and tell my boyfriend that I'm being a b word and try to get him on his side and be against me. I've seen him do that too! I've been giving my boyfriend numbers to other apartments but he isn't taking much interest in them. What do I do?! His work puts enough stress on our relationship as it is, this would be really bad for us. Please help me! Thank you so much!

20090203121234AAyQM5i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is our marriage doomed?	My Husband and I have been married for 6 years. Sex has really gone down hill. For 2 months, nothing. I feel lonely, rejected and horrible about myself. I tried to talk with him but he just says he is tired. To tired to make it to bed, to tired to have sex. He will not sleep in our bed. I try to get him up off the couch but nothing seems to work. I have gotten to the point I go to bed alone. If he comes fine if not fine. These last couple of weeks I have been feeling resentment. We have gotten into some heated arguments. To say the least it was just patched over. We seem to get along but it feels different. He feels like he is pulling further and further away. If I ask him what is wrong he comes back with "Nothing" He will not go to counseling. This has been on the table and he flat will not do it. We also have 3 kids which things more difficult.      I am just wondering why is he being this way? Is our marriage starting to dissolve?

20090203121013AA2GD6X	Family & Relationships;Family	How Do I Talk My Husband Into Marriage Counseling?	My husband and I have been married for 2 years and all of a sudden he wants to divorce. It came out of nowhere and he never talked to me about it before. He moved in with his dad and we separated. I tried to make things work, and he said he would too, but then he went back to saying he wanted to split. I still love him, even though he's put me through hell for the past three weeks. My head is telling me to just stop trying and try to move on, but my heart won't let him go; it's telling me to fight for him. I have loved him for almost 8 years now, and yes we're young, but when I told him I would marry him, I meant forever and he knew that. He asked me twice and he picked the date (which was sooner than I actually wanted, but I wanted him). He's hurt me so much, and I know that I should just stop and give in, but I just can't. Not until I've done everything that I can. I would like to try marriage counseling, just for a while, and if it doesn't help, I'll sign the papers. But I'm sure that he's not going to go for it. Not with his dad (who is on his 3rd or 4th wife and is a male chauvinistic pig in some cases) and other family members telling him how to handle it. I would like to just be able to sit in a neutral setting and at least try to work this out. I love him and I just don't know what to do. How can I talk him into going to a counselor? Really talk him into it?
20090203120109AAfJ2gc	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do about this?	Im engaged to an amazing NYPD man. He is so caring and treats me wonderful plus he is so gorgeous ha. He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed apparently on the job also. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same,They are very comfortable money wise and are so stuck up im not like them at all. They tell me i could do so much better but i absolutely love him. I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ended up putting his fist through the wall. He snapped at me the other night during sex, again i just walked away. We don't fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him. I was also engaged to a guy 3 years ago but he slept with someone else. He is now back around my friends and tells me he wants me back & says i mean the world to him.I use to love this man but he broke me. My family also really liked this guy. Please help?
20090203120447AAMcGDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP! Meeting my bf family for the first time?	Okay I thought I would be okay with the whole thing of meeting my bf's family next week for his brothers housewarming but my bf makes me so paranoid when he says I need to be more social etc. He knows I am very shy and he even said this when he met me that it kind of intrigued him to know more about me. But the downside is his family is very outspoken and they have dominating personalities. They seem to be nice, I only meant his brother briefly and his nephew and cousin. But you know, he explained that no one was going to be like catering to me or anything I would have just assume the role of being friendly before his family did.  Now that worries me a bit because I feel like shouldnt his family reach out to me if they know I am kind of on the reserved side? Idk what to do now. I told him to stop talking to me about how to act because it will make me paranoid.  He suggested I should have a drink before going idk if he was joking or not and I dont drink. Please help me. How do I interact with strangers? I never really had this problem before because people who want to talk to me would just talk to me.  He says my reserved attitude will come off as aloof and his family may not like me or may get the wrong idea about me.  It really kind of pisses me off he thinks this way. Help.

I have three brothers and three sisters, who despite countless invites, never come to my house to visit me. I always have to go where they live, then once there, they ignore my company as if I weren't even there. They do much together without asking me if I would like to join them. I haven't done anything wrong towards them and my house is spotless clean. I have been living with the question "Why" for years now. I think it's because I am the only one in my family who never married or had children, Could that be the reason?

20090203115923AAo30e5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong that I don't want another girlfriend because I'm sick of loosing things?	I've lost a lot in my life time. I have no family left, I'm not mobile anymore. I live under my work in the same building. Every time I try in life I always end up a few steps back just barely able to support myself with no one there to help me or at leas talk to when things get tough. Sometimes I wish I had someone in my life I could open up to. Maybe someone that could look at what is going on and say a few words of encouragement. But when I get to the point of getting out there and meeting someone I find myself not trying because every time in the past I've tried to get someone in my life like that they've only ended up hurting me. The last girlfriend I had 4 years ago ditched me on my birthday to sleep with another guy. The one before that dumped me on the day my mother died. She sent me photos of herself screwing a kid that was still in high school. Why try when women act this way? I get told that not all woman act this way, that I haven't met hte right one yet. But hell most women do act this way. My life has gotten so bad now if the right woman did come along I couldn't do anything about it. I've seriously thought about ending my life. That thought of putting a gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger. The idea of all this ending and there just being enternal sleep is becoming more and more like a better idea as time moves on. That scares me. I used to love life. I used to look foward to the future. Now that life has trapped me. Now that I can't problem solve my way out. It's really scary. End it all or live life like I'm in jail. Minimal freedoms, and nothing to look froward to. They won't even come pick me up to bring me to church anymore. Said it puts them too far out of their way. Even God has turned his back on me.      What is the point in all this when you can so easily loose it all?

We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I he's not using me for sex...it was never important to either of us. We haven't had sex in a month, but our bond is getting stronger and the time we spend together is more and more. He owes me a little money (which I dont really want back but his pride wont let him let it go) I feel like he is the incredible person he is to me because of his pride and not because he wants to be incredible to me...which is bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"      The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for...I care, but I'm just trying to take things slow...even If he fell in love with somone else I'd be alright)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???         Also, we are way past the flirting stage...the smiling and feather touches...We spoon each other almost every night to keep warm now    He knows that I have feelings for him and that I'm not ready for a relationship and he has told me that he's not ready for a relationship...we communicate pretty well   If I ask him this question he WILL say he's my friend...talk is cheap

I just feel like him not working right now is making me upset like im starting to think wow it must be nice to watch csi all day or something .       I even make little comments and he will say oh ya because i choose to get laid off.       Yes I know it wasn't his fault but im paying for everything and its getting hard and taking its toll on me !       How can I make it that im more supportive and not so bitchy about it. I even make him a list of places I want him to go apply .       In my mind i start to think oh what if he isn't even looking or trying just hanging out with family & friends when im over hear stressing like mad !         breaking up or kicking him out isn't an option so avoid that advice.        What are some jobs or things I could have him do to even bring in like 100 bucks a month.      thanks =)

I'm sure over the years a real birth certificate can change it's attributes design-wise, but if you find a design flaw or someone didn't sign it could it be fake?  Like, if a kid was adopted but their parents showed them a birth certificate as they grew up. (Can the state actually give parents certificates for adopted kids?)

20090221025222AAMZaGA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is having a problem with him being friends with an ex, Okay?	So when my boyfriend and I first started dating casually he told me that he was friends with his ex-girlfriend. I normally don't have a problem with this, but after hearing the story of her I told him straight up that I would have a problem with him being friends with her if we ever became serious.      So here's her story: They dated for 2 years in High School until they broke up after their senior year. He then joined the Navy in hopes that she would beg him to stay. She didn't so he left to Japan. A year later he paid for her to fly to Japan to see him so he could ask her to marry him. I guess before he got the chance to ask she told him that she got back together with her ex. So her and her ex get married, 2 years later he comes home and hangs out with her. He tells her how he was going to propose to her. She gets all upset and tells him she would've said yes. The first few months of his and my relationship he talked about 'regrets' and 'missed opportunities'. This concerned me a little, but I choose to ignore it.      Six months into our relationship I mustered the courage to ask him to stop being friends with her. He became extremely defensive and told me he'd never stop being friends with her for another relationship. I guess his last girlfriend asked the same thing and their relationship only lasted six months...So a little hurt, I agreed with him. It was understandable.      A little further down the road we decide to move in together. I took this as a hint that our relationship had finally become serious enough for me to ask again. So I call him and ask, he gets very angry and hangs up on me. He called me the next day apologizing, saying that he really does love me and it's not worth it to him. I moved in with him and we didn't talk about it again.       He proposed to me on Valentine's Day, I'm so incredibly in love with him, so of course I say yes! It's been quite a while since we talked about his ex, but the other day I was talking to one of my male friends about the proposal and my boyfriend completely flipped out on me. He said "So you can have guy friends, but I can't have ANY female friends?". Keep in mind the only female I have ever had a problem with him being friends with is his ex. So it was obvious this was about her.      So I want to know if I'm being unreasonable about this whole thing? I'm not sure if I can ignore my feelings toward the situation if I do let him talk to her again. This is kind of making me want to put marriage on the back burners. If I talk to him, what am I supposed to say?

20090221030222AAvq3Ev	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I begin to rebuild the relationship with my dad?	My parents divorced when I was 7 and my dad just lef without saying anything to either my mum or me. He didn't try to contact me or my mum for over 3 years. My mum made countless efforts to get him to see me and pay child support. Eventually he began paying child support but never saw me or my older sister.    Now my dad is making an effort to see me again. I'm almost 20 now and I've just about got over him. Whenever I do see him he tells me what a disappointment I am, insults my mother and tells me I'm doomed to fail. He also doesn't accept my girlfriend and insults her.    I've told him I won't stand for it much longer and he swear to change, but every time we go through the continuous cycle of arguments and regret.    I would like to have a relationship with my dad, but atm he's causing more trouble than good. How do I begin to rebuild the relationship between us? How do I get him to change his ways?

20090203122354AAkrsVS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FELLAS ONLY!!!.........??	was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever" Was this a compliment? Or a diss? What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. Wednesday night someone called me but I was in the shower & missed it. Since I don’t have caller ID I dunno who it could be, but I have a feeling it was him. Today (Monday), one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...". Then he texted again & ssaid if I wanna meet up.    I went on msn now to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?” I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Then I told him thr truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”. Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him?   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.

20090221030815AAtrYh9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stay with my long term boyfriend or try something new?	Okay here is the story: I broke up with my boyfriend of five years last summer. I never imagined ever breaking up with him, but he had changed, started putting his friends first and generally wasn't very nice. At the time I was really upset, especially as I had a huge family crisis happening at the same time and he wasn't there to support me. To move on I quickly went into another relationship, the guy was brilliant we had great emotional and physical chemistry, yet we lived too far away for it to be practical. Over that time period my ex boyfriend told me he still loved me and wanted to make another go of things. Despite first resisting I went back to him. We have a great time together having fun, although the physical side isn't as fun as what I had with the other guy. What should I do, I love my long term boyfriend but I am not sure whether I love him as a friend or if I really am in love with him? I keep thinking that perhaps the new relationship was more fun, just because it was exactly that...new!? Help, i'm all confused!!
20090221030914AACcahT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do/think if this happened to you?	First off, I want to say that I'd probably laugh my *** off, as it would tell me that things aren't going too well in her world(marriage/life/etc)& thats why she's doing this. I also think curiosity on her part, and what not. Not to mention a few other things, but I'm curious to hear what YOU all have to say about this:      My ex GF(who is now married w/a kid from some douche), who broke up w/me in a rather bad way, has been driving by my house recently. We went out for 3 .5 years, and how it ended badly, has always been a sore spot w/me. Anyways, in a selfish sort of way, I've always hoped things w/her new "douche"(oops I mean man), wouldn't work out and that she'd realize what she had w/us.      Ok...more to the point, recently, I've been told by my neighbors that they've seen this mysterious vehicle "ever so often" coming by my house. It'll pull up in front, stop a few seconds, and then, if someone see's, or comes out, speeds off really fast. The description of the vehicle matches that of my ex gf, and putting 2 and 2 together, I figure it has to be her. Well, I kept hearing about this from my neighbors for about 2-3 months, and yeterday, while taking out my trash, I saw the car stopped in front of my house. I dont think they(she) saw me @ first, as I was coming from the side of the house, to the front of the driveway. When I walked to the front, I noticed the car sitting there, it apparently saw me walking up, and took off rather fast. I just stood there for a second and laughed, and thought"Must be a tough time in Princess land for her?". Anyways, what would you do/think/say if one of your ex's(gf/bf/wife/hubby/etc) "happened" to drive by your home, or you found out they did this more than once?      I asked a couple of my married friends, and they said it has to be that she's unhappy with her current marriage(situation) and could be regretting it, and wonders what I'm up to? I dont know what to make of this, thats why I'm asking what all of you think?

20090221051735AAjN8lj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get my husband to solve problems?	I want change in my marriage.  I have asked, begged, pleaded, screamed, threatened, cried, but nothing works.  My husband and I have many arguments.  I tolerated so much for so long and now my tolerance level has changed.  I don't want to just exist in the same house anymore.  I told him my expectations are to deal with problems, solve the problems, and to move on happily with a loving marriage.      I said we don't solve our problems, he does not take responsibility, he finds ways to blame me, he does not apologize, and he has an emotional brick wall.  He says I yell too much.        Everytime I try to discuss our problems it turns into another argument and he accuses me of trying to control him.  We are not solving the problems.  We can't talk anymore.  We can't even speak to each other.      He says he is doing everything he can, but I say he is doing nothing.  He says the fact he is still here should prove that he loves me.  I said it proves he needs somewhere to live...       What should I do, just leave?
20090221031754AAPHDzL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I Over Reacting Or Is It Something Else?	Yesterday my best friend (boy) told me that he had sex for the first time with his valentine. They are both 15. I was a little shocked because i didn't even know that he liked her-they weren't boyfriend and girlfriend. After a while he asked me, "we videoed...you wanna see?"-then i got completely angry. I said to him, "how can you video an act of love and show all your f***ing friends...and laugh about it??". And then he replied, "what can i say...i'm a ****". I can't describe the kind of emotions i felt...(mainly anger). Then i asked him, "did you love her or did you just use her?" He replied, "alright love don't cry about it...you ain't shakespeare..anyway i'm off home now...got to go for a quickie". Then he kissed me on the cheek and went back home. He doesn't ever talk to me like that...he would never ever use words like..."alright love, don't cry about it". After he went home i felt empty...i felt completely destroyed. Is it normal for best friends (we've been best friends since we were 3) to be feeling like that...or judging by my reaction do you think that i have other feelings towards him or am i just over reacting? I just so confused...sorry it's a long question.      Thanks XD

We are not married  but I put her up on a pedestal so high I couldn't reach her anymore. I have failed her miserably. i have failed not only her and the children but also myself. I am in such a dark place without light. I do not know what to do. i desperately want them back. Life without them is no life at all. I can not seem to open up. We do not argue ( I just clam up and that is frustrating to both of us ). i do not know how to express myself or my feelings and just feel totally lost. We have been together 8 years , I do not know if we are stale as we have been cooped up together working from home for the past 8 months? i just cannot seem to open up. Can ayone in the UK help?   Like a lot of people financially in difficulties. But do not drink, smoke our only vice seems to be chocolate. How can I reach out and mend this pedestal? or shorten it? I placed her there and now I no longer know what to do.

20090221051354AASPLmu	Family & Relationships;Family	How will you deal with this?	If you live closer to almost every relative of your husband. If they always want to meddle into your family's affairs, taking your things without asking permission. And if you don't give in to their demands, will destruct your credibility by gossiping you all over the place. And you just can't simply leave because it's the only house you own. Any idea how?

She's been undisciplined in her diet lately, and I'd like to give her the present of good health.  I can't help but to notice that she's gotten a bit thick in the thighs and wide in the glide.  I don't want to give up on her just yet.  I'm thinking I could buy her a few cases of slim-fast and a high-tec turbo treadmill of some sort.  Then I'll work her like a fire ant until she's svelte and bony to my satisfaction.  Can anybody recommend a good piece of equipment for our cause?

20090221031535AAIiCNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl ignoring me?	A little backstory. I met this girl about five years ago in highschool because we rode the same bus... I had a girlfriend at the time so I never really talked to her much, just basically joked with her on the ride home.      Well, about a year ago, I ran into her on myspace and we started talking and she seemed excited about wanting to hangout, so she invited me to come watch a movie with some friends and whatnot, but nothing ever happened then because she was leaving for the army a week after I found her online.      She got discharged recently for medical reasons, something to do with her back, so she called me and wanted to hang out again now that she was back, SO, I took the opportunity to ask her out on a date this saturday. She said yes, so I thought things were looking good. That night we had a party in a hotel room with a couple other friends and we crashed on the same bed... well that next morning I woke up and realized I had rolled over and put my arm around her, but she never said anything about it. When we packed up and started to leave she looked pale and got a bad nosebleed, I asked if she was okay, and she told me she was fine and could make it home by herself. So I left it at that.      That was wednesday morning. I called her the next day to see if she was feeling better... no answer. I figured it was no big deal, so I texted her on a break at work, just bored and wanting to talk to someone, no reply. I messaged her on myspace earlier and asked if she still wanted to go out saturday night or if she changed her mind. it shows it was read, but she didn't reply.      A friend saw her at the mall with a couple of her friends and said she looked fine, and even stopped to chat for a bit, so I know she's okay, so it just bugs me that all of the sudden she doesn't want to talk to me... if I did something wrong the I'd at least like to know about it....      Anyway, the question I have now is... did she get freaked out about me putting my arm around her while I was passed out, or would there be any other reason she just started ignoring me? I'd ask her myself, but then I'd probably seem like a creepy bastard that wouldn't leave her alone... opinions?

I can't keep myself from staring at him in Choir (a class that we both love) and when he looks my way, instinctively I just divert where I'm looking. Should I actually look him in the eye and hold his gaze, or am I doing the right thing? I'm not sure if he likes me back, but I want him to. Gods, I don't know what I should do if he were to ask me if I were staring. Would saying "I don't know" trigger anything?

20090221045531AA0C91U	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do for my husband's birthday?	My husband's birthday is coming up and I want it to be nice for him. For the past 2 years he's had really awful birthdays. 2 years ago he came home from work to find me and my brother and sister in my flat crying because my dad was diagnosed with cancer that day. Then last year I was away from home on his birthday because my dad had just died and I'd been with him and was then with my mum sorting the funeral etc. So he's had really terrible birthdays! I have been feeling pretty down (all year actually, but particularly the last week or so) because it's nearly the anniversary of my dad's death, but I don't want him to think that his birthday is always going to be a painful time for me, so I want to make it nice. Trouble is we have zero money. The business he's worked really hard at hasn't succeeded and he's closing it. I work full time but all that money just seems to disappear on bills, etc. I have tried to persuade him going out for one meal won't hurt but he says he doesn't want to do anything for his birthday. So it will have to be something at home that doesn't cost much. Any suggestions?

20090220231625AAwrs30	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she acting like this? 10 PTS for BEST ANSWER?	It all started when I had feelings for this girl (and I think she had feelings for me).      In class, we were watching a movie and I was sitting by myself, and she was as well.  I looked back with a smirk on my face, and told her to come here using my hands/fingers.  She came up to be with a kool-aid smile (lol) and rushed to sit by me.  We talked, and talked...We talked about her weekends, and etc.  I said a few jokes and we both laughed.      Week 2:      We're watching a new movie in class, and I notice she was laying down (on her side with her hand on her head) on the stage by herself  while watching the movie.  I approach her and sat behind her (on the stairs).  I said hey, she gave me a wave with a smile on her face.  We didn't talk much because I noticed her squinting her eyes to the T.V, so I figured she was too focus on the movie.  I offered her some candy, and said thanks (with a smile of course). I said some jokes about the movies once again, and we both laughed. And that's how that day went.      Now, the days after she feels like she's too cool to even notice me now.    She walks by me, without even saying hey, and etc.  I don't even know what's going on...Any ideas?

20090221001248AAP7oDg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do the right thing.......?	Well my friends girl texted me around midnight, and started to tell me she started cutting again (she stopped the sh*t for 5 months) and I got pissed at her telling her not to do it, but then I thought it's not going to get thru her head so I told her whats the use of me saying don't do it if I know you won't listen. Then she started asking me from one of my other friend's numbers and I remember that last time she did that she ended up flirting with the person (who was me) she got the number from my cousin, and me and my friend got into it over that and are barely friends now. I told her I wouldn't give it to her because I don't want her to end up flirting with him, and then ending up with my friend mad at my other friend. She started to say that I was calling her a slut by saying that and I told her I didn't mean it that way, and then she got pissed and the last text I got from her after she was joking about something read:      "that was sarcasms...**** you that wasn't"      I tired to send her some more text but she turned her phone off so she can't get them. I have to ask though did I do the right thing?

This guy at work always seems to be looking at me, do u think he could be interested? Just everytime i seem to look at him he's looking at me, the other day he smile and i just thought he was looking at someone else, so i didnt smile back then he did this kinda weird shocked look and put his arms up as though he was yawning, it was odd. He is always looking not in weirdo way, just i have started to notice it. I broke up with my bf in Dec and have only just started to notice him looking but when i think back he as been doing it for ages.
20090221053930AAPc2V9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A Divorce problem?! :(?	Well my parents divorced a year ago. They waited until I was older to divorce because it was easier for them. Now I feel lonely, and awful because they divorced, and at night sometimes I start crying secretly. When I try telling my mom, she just says it's better for the family and then walks way. And most of all, I really don't want to divorce when I'm an adult, but I've heard when someones parents are divorced, it increases the chance of them to get divorced when they're older. Is that true? Please help me!

20090220235102AAlP7mH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you keep your church from your spouse?	My wife & I have had our problems lately and she went to a church on her own and spoke to a priest about things, and whatever advice she was given worked out well for us.      I initially asked her where she went, but she didn't want to tell me and still refuses to tell me.      I believe the reason is we had a big blow up about religion.   Specifically my wife's sister invited us to her new church and I didn't want to become involved or have my family involved with her sister's church.  I was raised Catholic (as was my wife), we got married in a Catholic Church and baptized our son in a Catholic Church.  I stick with the Catholic Church because it is my family tradition (which is important to me) but also since I don't agree with lots of things my church teaches, I find it pointless to swith to a church that I feel the exactly the same about or even worse.   My wife however has been curious about her sister's church and it was sort of a sticking point that I didn't agree with most of her sister's religous views.  I'm not opposed to going to the church, I just would rather experience it a few times with just my wife & son instead of going with her sister who may feel insulted if I just decide it's not what I want for me or my son.  My wife however can do what she likes & we can also discuss my son.         So my question:   Is it fair for my wife to refuse to tell me which church she went to for advice?  I feel like as her husband it is my right to know...   If it was her sister's church I think I would probably be more open to attending, but the fact that she's refusing to tell me is bothering me.

20090220182244AAd7szl	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Trying to decide on a wedding date..help!!!?	My boyfriend and i got engaged on Wednesday and now we are trying to decide on a date for the wedding....we orginally wanted this october but we have been told that that date was way to soon so we were thinking maybe the end of May 2010, we live in Massachusetts so i wasnt sure if anyone has been to or had a wedding in May and had some insight on what the weather/flowers etc was like. We really had our hearts set on October because we love the fall but we dont want to wait until Oct 2010 becuase we have other weddings that month so we dont want to be sandwiched in with those, plus my fiance is in school still so Oct would be tough to try and plan and have a honeymoon etc which is why were thinking of May. anyway any advice would be greatly appreciated....oh and any additional advice on how to cut costs for a wedding would be great too!!! thanks!!!

Like something is wrong with you yourself ?   Or do you worry that you don't match up to the sexy bodies that flood the porn industry ?   Does it make you jealous, what he is doing ?   Has this lead to a reduction in your own interest in sex with your partner?
20090221024927AAzsdGx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever regretted sex afterwards?	I had a long-term relationship, and we broke up. We were completely monogamous to each other, but after we broke up, I went wild. I slept with other guys, trying to get into a relationship again, but it was all just sex and a see ya later. I regret those guys because it is not like me to just have sex with different guys. I am trying to be more myself, attending church regularly, and basically rekindling my sprirt. Ever regret sex this much? Do you think those guys happened for a reason? I mean, I feel much wiser in terms of the dating scene.

He started saying some scenerio's and although I never thought about it I was turned on. After I told him I would never do that in real life, but it's a normal fantasy, he tells me he would want to do it in real life! Then he says eventho it's bad it feels so good. He also has trouble remembering things from when he was 10 or younger, which is odd. I'm starting to think he was abused as a child! what should I do????

20090221005359AAEiPJ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can there really be a healthy long distance relationship?	My situation is that I am a junior and my girlfriend is a senior. She is going to graduate and probably move about 2 hours away to go to college. I absolutely love her. I would be able to drive out every other week to see her and stuff. Its just that all the long distance relationships that I know of usually end up in ****. My sister has a constant off and on relationship with her boyfriend who is stationed in hawaii. I know it will be hard. Hell it would be tempting if I was going to be in her position. I would still be just a high school kid.      And also I don't know my final decision but I might be planning to move out of state to go to college. That was my original plan for about 4 years but I might change it for love. Thats saying how much I love her. And also      What are the chances of us both going through college and resume where we left off as in high school?       I am scared of losing this girl. I honestly think I would never be able to find another girl like her.      thanks

20090221015522AAR7UVC	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my overprotective parents?	I have a very close knit over protective Jewish family. They watch everything I do and are always concerned about me, and very invasive, my parents are way too overprotective. I want to go on a trip to Europe with a couple of girlfriends during spring break and they said outright that I couldn't go because they're much too worried about me. I often feel very angry at them and even feel that I dislike them. They also dislike my friends for no reason, except for the fact that they are not religious Jews and they think they're a bad influence....I have quite a few siblings but they're most protective with me because I have Cystic Fibrosis and I've often been quite ill, but I am responsible enough to do the treatments I need daily myself or with the help of my friends and take all the medications at the right times myself if I went on the trip. I feel like they treat me like a baby and never trust me enough to do anything on my own and I'm 17.       How can I get them to agree to let me go on the trip? And how can I get them to quit being so watchful and protective of me?
20090221011739AAQtbMX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls get so jealous?	I went out on one date with this girl I really liked. She liked me too, but for some reason (perhaps I was too nice to her), she said she didn't want to date and just wanted to be friends. So I'm at a house party tonight and I meet this gorgeous sophomore and we are grindin like none other and making out and dancing at least for 20 mins straight. I began to notice the girl I dated was hovering around me every few mins and when I looked over at her she gave me this death stare. She looks greatly pissed. So later that night I told her to stop being angry all the time and she said "I'm not angry it's just my nature" but I got a vibe from her that she was upset. Plus she's one of those people who hide their feelings to not make a scene.

20090220235646AAogAWH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? I need help plsssssssssssss?	I was in relationship for one year until my man decided to broke up with me because his family decided that they had enough of me and I am not good enough for the family and I will corrupt the family reputation because I am open-mind person and have strong personality and that the last thing they want in their daughter in law.   My ex stood in front of me and cried and said that he can’t take to be his wife and wanted me to forgive him. Did I cry? My heart was deceased due to shock.    It had been now one year and couple months of the deadly breakup. Few weeks ago, I found out our common friends, coworkers are insisting to deliver message to me. The message about my ex, he got married to some girl that his family picked her for him. I noticed that all people I thought they are my friends were looking at me to see my face expression when I found out about my ex wedding but I was really cool and I told them to deliver my message to him that I wish him all the best and happiness but the truth is the old wound wasn’t recover yet and they pressed it again to make it bleeding.    If they were friends, they should not do this, or what they mean by telling me about his wedding?   Because of this wound, I lost my interest in men. Whenever I met guy, I found myself asking him about his parents and his personality and ability of making his own decision
20090221020148AAdteVx	Family & Relationships;Family	I cant help but feel this whenever I walk with my sister in public. Am I overreacting?	I must admit my sister is very attractive. The people I know that have seen her always comment to me later on that she's pretty.      So when I walk with her in public, I wanted to see if she had many looks from the street. The women looked but just at her face.       The men though....some stared at her face and tried to check out her boobs or her legs and some just stared at her legs. I wanted to punch them so badly! The thought of what those men were thinking in their heads of certain actions they could 'perform' really disgusted me...because she's my sister...      So, yeah...am I overreacting?      (just a side note:I cant believe there are so many perverts..at least where I was walking)
20090221001653AAVPrIG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I have left her there?

When I got there her sister  told me they were out the back and i can go right on through out the back and get her. She went back up stairs and as i was walking down the hallway i was looking around and just have a look at each room as i hadn't been there before and i found one of my sisters friends tied gagged and blindfolded to a chair in the bedroom. I untied her and when me and her went out the back all the other girls started telling me off for untieing. I tryed to find out what happened but all i got was a "you wouldn't understand Response Should i have left her there and just ignored her.

He never used to be like this and has got slowly worse. He wont do anything and is constantly on his games consoles, We have two children, we are not married. This is my house he moved in with me and he takes that as i have to do everything.    I dont want to leave him because i know he has the capacity to be a nice man like he used to be. The house is a mess because he wont help me and i have to look after two children and try and clean and cook as well. Its also very hard for me to leave him, i tried once and he wouldnt leave me alone till i agreed to start talking to him again   I am at college during the week and he doesnt work, he lost his job before christmass and he has been especily lazy and useless since then.   I have tried everything and he has even started to become a bit careless with me. He has twisted both my wrists in the last few months and he even dumped our baby daughter on my stomach when she woke up in the night and that hurt me too. I dont think he ment to do these but im worried about him, im worried he is also depressed about not working, But ive told him that just because he feels useless doesnt mean he has to be useless but he wont listen to me.       Are these the early warning signs of something worse?

But its so its getting obnoixous, i caught her basically cheating on her boyfriend (her boyfriend happens to be my long time best guy friend his names ben) who which i actually have a huge crush on. So its taking all of me not to tell ben, but i dont want to hurt him.      she was on his lap talking to him outside the school, i swear they were about to make out when i walked over they jumped up.

20090221000151AAi73hv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you confront your significant other when you know they are lying/?	Ok, I know a lot of people say this... but I am allergic to cigarette smoke. I don't know what it is but if I am around too much of it I will start vomiting uncontrollably and get a rash all over my body and hives on my hands. Well when I met my, now, fiance he smoked. I made it very clear from the beginning that I couldn't be around it. About a year into our relationship he "quit".  well it has been years.. we are engaged and I am now living with him. we are living in his mother's old house (we are fixing it up and we are moving out of the state) and she was a heavy smoker so the house REEKS of smoke... well I started to smell the smoke more and more (usually smoke dissipates, it doesn't get worse.... so of course I STARTED to suspect my fiance but never said anything. Then.. the first laundry day came... I did laundry and he told me to put everything away but to put his boxers on top of the dresser... and specifically not to put them away.. so i did what he said.. but for about a week it drove me crazy wondering why... so finally.. i know this is bad.. but i checked his underwear drawer.. and low and behold-- a CARTON of cigarettes.  now ever since then I smell cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE! I thought I was crazy but I am getting hives and it is just awful... i attempted to confront him by just talking about smoking in general and he went on about how happy he is that he quit and so on.. so i WANT to believe him so bad.. and at one point in a fight I accused him and he got VERY angry and insisted that he quit and would never smoke again and so on and so on...      well i checked again.. that carton is still there... his bathroom (we have separate bathrooms) REEKS of smoke.. so i KNOW he has been smoking...         what do I do? he denies it everytime I ask, but I honestly can't live like this.      i am losing weight because I am so sick from it.. I have hives covering my hands and arms... I KNOW he does and he just insists it is from his mother (she stops by once a week and of course smokes)      i want to believe him but i have to be rational. what should i do?
20090220224408AA5lQ7o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend and my religion dont mix?	well, i actually don't have a religion.       i actually might think i'm aethiest. but by choice.       anyways, he's a christian. not a big one, but still goes to church and would like me to join. however, he still knows i'm not religios whatsoever.      so my question is, how can i get him to stop, gently ?
20090221014614AAkEvbW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and this guy, our eyes got locked. Does it mean anything at all?	he is just a family friend and i dont even talk to him much, but when our eyes locked it felt like a very long time and it felt like the world has just started moving again when i removed my eyes from him. kind of weird feeling.         means anything?
20090221022905AAZzghy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Told him to stop but he still doesn't?What do i do?	Ok this married man in my neighborhood had been acting strange and giving me stares out of the windows of his car and moving his head 90 degrees to look at me without even concentrating on the road. I had to tell his friend that he needs to stop and i didn't like it at all. After his friend told him to stay away. I still sometimes notice him doing the same thing, like yesterday he was on his bike and i was with my brother and then again while driving his bike he moved his head to look at me.      I really don't know how to behave now because i thought the warning would scare him off and i wont have to deal with him again, but he is just does not move back. He even does that when i am with my brother, though i have not told my brother, seems like he isn't scared. Now what do i do with this creep?

20090220224814AAPu3jw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it bad to like an old friend's brother?	So there's this guy in my classes. We mostly talk in Science and sometimes talk in the other two classes we have together. He's one of my old friend's brother (if that makes sense). He just recently got a girlfriend. I'm not sure if he likes me or if he's just being nice to me.      In Science class he always wants to play with my water bottle..literally it's a water bottle. I had to chose my classes for next year and I was freaking out (I had to write an essay and it was really hard) and he like put his hand on my shoulder and left it there for like 30 seconds and told me it would be ok. We're learning about genetics and he asked what my dad looked about because I told him that I blame my dad for giving me his (my dad's) genes and I told him that my dad is on the bigger side (and I kinda am too) and then he told me that all my kids would be short with brown eyes and skinny..but I'm not skinny. Although I do have brown eyes and I am short. Oh, and He's a freshmen in high school and I'm a sophomore in high school.       Yea, that's pretty much it. Sorry if it's not much but it's all I got. Does he like me or is he just being nice??

20090221020332AAr5lwq	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends buy me stuff that I hate, and I don't know how to tell them?	My friends buy me things that I hate. I don't tell them I hate it, because sometimes it's expensive stuff. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but at the same time I don't wan them to waste their money on these things that I never use/wear.      Example #1: For christmas, my friends bought me merchandise from my all-time favorite band. The thing is, the only band shirts I wear are from local bands. I don't like wearing popular band merchandise. It makes me feel like a poser. It's not a big deal, but they bought me t-shirts and hoodies that I never wear and are basically brand new in my closet. (also, for my birthday 2 years prior they bought me merchandise from the same band that I never wore and ended up giving to good will.)      Example #2: My friend bought me a knock-off Fendi purse while in NY. It's UGLY. I never use it, but I feel bad because she spent the money on it and was very excited to give it to me.      Now my friends ask me why I never use/wear these gifts that I expressed joy over receiving, and I have no answer.      How do I tell them to stop buying me these things without hurting their feelings?
20090221015400AArlhSm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The girl im sort of seeing kissed another girl on the weekend. Im not sure what to think.?	This was like a full on proper kiss followed by some breast fondling. I know a lot of guys would love this but it really doesn't sit well with me. I really don't know what to think.   It was just the two of them so it wasn't to put on a show or anything and they where both drunk. We have discussed it and she says she enjoyed it but wouldn't do it again. We have discussed it a lot and moved on but i still don't feel right about the whole thing.   In addition it was on valentines day... in MY bed (i was sleeping on the couch so they could get a more comfortable sleep)

20090220223115AAS8njS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell if he likes me?	Well, there's this guy in my class that I like, and we sit right next to each other.   We aren't friends, but we get along. There's something that kind of connects him and me but it's hard to explain.   He usually gets annoyned by all these other girls who like him, and it seems that he doesn't at me.   Sometimes I don't know that I am but I kind of flirt when I have a chance to talk to him.   I don't flirt like a whore, I just talk and make him laugh.   And also, another thing to add is that during class I was talking to my friend who sits to my left and when I turned to him I saw him staring at me, but I looked back. The way he was looking at me wasn't a smile, but not a glare either (he tends to glare at people a lot) and I saw that he was really bright.      And can you just list some stuff that can help me tell if he likes me? Or even saying something supportive can do a lot!   So, help!

I've got a teacher where I study with whom I've always had a very good relationship.I've known her for 6 years,and we use to talk a lot.   The thing is that after a lot of personal problems I had,I've realised that she's controlling me more than she used to do,asking other teachers if I improve or not,watching me,etc...   I've always thought that she could have developed a maternal instinct,since she has no children and she's not married either.But I'm not a child(I'm 24) so I don't know what her feelings are.   This is my last year in that centre and when I told her about that she told me not to worry because we would still be in contact.

I am debating whether or not I should move and get my own apartment now. I have a full time job that doesn't pay all that much but I make enough to maintain my own place. Recently me and my mom haven't been seeing eye to eye on a lot of things. For instance she still thinks I should have a curfew, she wants to meet all of the friends (whether girl or guy) I hang around, especially if I say I'm going somewhere with them, she likes to control majority of the things I do, and she is very overprotective. My mother and I have a good relationship, but I'm to the point where I think its best for me to go out on my own... What do you think?????

20090220234016AASrN3x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think? (answers please!)?	My friend is a lesbian and had her first kiss with this girl she was good friends with and had a crush one. The girl freaked out and never talked to her again, but also never told anyone about the kiss. My friend moved on and dated two different girls in her freshmen year. Then in her sophomore year the girl she kissed in 7th grade transferred to her school. They started talking and the girl said that she liked her and was scared in 7th grade, but wanted to date her now. They've been dating for about 2 years, but my other friend keeps saying that the girl probably isn't gay and is just experimenting. Do you think she would have been in the relationship for 2 yrs if she was just experimenting? Also would you have started dating her in the first place because of how she acted the first time?

20090220224617AACBsUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 13 and in love with my sisters 23 year old friend?	When I first saw her was before her and my sister went to Buffalo Bill's Birthday bash. One time her and my sisters friends were over and were drinking and I put my hands on her leg and started hitting on her. She called me a pervert and told me to get away. Another time I smacked her *** and she has been mean muggin me ever since then. She isn't really friends with my sister anymore though and I feel bad. They were having a sleep over and I started taking off her clothes while she was sleeping and she woke up and screamed. I screamed too and said that I was sleep walking and had just woken up. It seemed like the perfect plan except for the 1 flaw that could have happened did and that was her waking up. For her birthday I tried buying her something nice, but I have never shopped for a girl before and I didn't know what to buy an older girl so I bought her birth control. I need girl advice. How do I make this girl mine.

20090221010151AAAgLHj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Engaged again 2nd time Same guy, but still like some one else?	Okay, so the situation is that I was married to guy#1 for 2 years and then we got divorced. Guy#1 moved another woman in and we just weren't compatible anymore; therefore I started dating. I dated 4 guys and became really infatuated with the last guy I dated and we will call him guy#2. Then along comes guy#1 again and says that he wants to try it again. Well I had moved out of town and was moving on with my life and he was having problems with his new fiance. So he came to visited me and asked me to move back in with him. (This was the third time we had seperated while we were married, but the first time divorced.) So we had a reputation of seperating and getting back together. So I told guy#2 that my ex wanted to try it again, but that I still cared for him and he said that he understood. I moved back in with guy#1 and it is better than it had been b4, but I really miss being single and doing whatever I want. And lately I have been talking to guy#2 and have realized that I really enjoyed being with him. With guy#1 I don't have the conversation that I have with guy#2, but I have the past(which wasn't always good) with guy#1 and I am used to it. But on the other hand with guy#2 I have felt completely comfortable since day 2 and have since. I am engaged to guy#1, but dont know if I am doing it 'cause it is old hat. I really miss guy#2, and everything about him. It was never about sex with guy#2, even though it was great but about the conversation that I couldn't ever have with guy#1. Also the sex was great with guy#1. A part of me wants to tell guy#1 that I don't want to rush into it again and that I still want to date and be single. How do I deal with this I am just so freaking lost and confused?   And if you guys think I should tell him that I want to be single, please tell me how to go about saying so. I am also 22yrs old. Maybe I am just nervous since this is attemp#4. Help!   I guess what I truly want is to date and live on my own and do what I want, when I want, how I want.

20090221024206AAcmRfJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you guys think it'd be ok still keep in contact with my "ex step mom"?	My dad and step mom have been together since I was 5(married when I was 7) and I have become really close to her. But now they are getting a divorce. Do you think it'd be strange if I still wanted to see her? I mean I am closer to her than I am to my father, and we always talk about serious things.    I don't live with them and never have, but I visit them quite a bit. Me and my step-mom are close. I haven't asked her if she'd still want to see me, but I'm sure she does. Shes a very sweet and down to earth person and I don't think that she'd shun me from her life because he and my father had some issues. I think she is a great enough person to be able to put that aside and still keep in contact with me. I mean I am sure that I wont see her as much as I used to, but I don't want to lose someone who has been in my life since I was so young. I'm almost 19 now, and I've known her since I was 5. She has played a big role in my life and helped me out many times. She considers me one of her own kids even though I'm not. Me and her have a special bond that she doen't have with my dads other kids. They are distant from her, and it just sucks really bad that things didn't work out for her and my dad because we've been getting even closer as I grow older. I've also gotten close to her kids.       What do you guys think? Will this be okay?   I'm not sure how my dad would feel about it. He isn't very open about his feelings. Me and him hardley even talk, the sad thing is she knows more about me and is more involved in my life than he is, and I feel like no longer talking to her would be like no longer talking to a parent.

20090221014503AAJniCp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am part of a FFM relationship- and am having some trouble! How can I tell off my lovers in a mature fashion?	My girlfriend and I entered a threesome with a male friend of ours. The relationship itself is going surprisingly well, but the problem is that they are both very selfish lovers, and have even admitted it! I find often times I feel left out, neglected, or used!       Every night she and I drive him home from work, and sometimes we stay the night. Today I came home from work sick and wound up relatively bedridden. My girlfriend went over to stay the night at his house and has not even checked up on me- right after a very lengthy conversation in which I explained that I feel neglected, used, and unappreciated. I've only had this conversation once so far, and I'm torn between wondering if they're having a discussion about the problem, or just fell right into it without even thinking about how I must feel, sick at home. How can I tell them both off in a mature and understanding fashion- for proving tonight they are just as neglectful and selfish as I was afraid they were?

This is an honest question, and I would like to get an answer.

20090220224619AAlAtWB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have this girls number...now  what?	Ok so theres this girl who ive noticed at school staring at me and spring break is next week so today I finally got the balls to talk to her, cuz it would suck waiting a whole week.  It turns out we live right by each other which is rare because school is 45 minutes away and mostly everyone lives right by schoool or farther. She asked if I was going anywhere for SB and im not, and I asked her and shes not. I said we should hang out over SB and she gave me her number.    Now should I call her or text her , and when? Wait a few days or do it tomorrow? We have now through next sunday off. It turns out since we live so close we have alot of the same friends. So what should I ask her to do? go somewhere just us 2 or hang out with someone we both know to make it less akw.      I know the answer may seem obvious, but yall dont understand, I cannot screw this up. Every other girl I have been talking to this year at college  didnt end up  working out because we live so far from each other.

I am attracted to girls sexually for the most part and I dont have any sexual attraction towards guys.      I started being friends with this one guy.

We've been good friends for a long time and we have gone out as friends several times. We have never kissed until a few weeks ago. We have gone out three of the past four weekends and he normally hugs me and maybe kisses me on the cheek. but the other night he kissed me on the lips. Not a passionate kiss just a sweet simple goodbye peck. It surprised me and I'm not sure what it means. Does he want more? Is he just being friendly? What?

I wish that you could understand, but I know that’s just a dream   I love you too much, and I wish you could say the same.   I know you have your life now, that I am just a block in your way   But even though you don’t care, I wish still to this day.

(You can be honest if it sucks)   Do you have any advice or things i should change? I just wrote this about how i feel at the moment. Im 16

We were starting to get on a more deep level, going out and stuff but never formally as a couple.  We had fun and it was nice, he made it seem like we were progressing but just out of nowhere he stopped calling and returning my calls.  I don't think there was anything I did that could have made him behave this way, but now I can't get it out of my head.  Was it me? Am I responsable? How can I let go...?  This is driving me insane.

20090221010247AAQcXub	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do, help???????????	Theres this girl in some of my classes at school, and we really don't get on (to put it nicely). She always has a go at me about my opinoins just because theyre different to hers, has a go at me because I have really fair skin, about the way I talk because I speak with a typically English accent. She thinks that just because I have some expensive stuff and talk properly, that makes me a snob, and that I think I'm better than everyone. She has most people on her side.      I can deal with her doing that though, but now shes started leaving offensive comments on my facebook page and harrassing me on facebook chat, frequently calling me "arrogant, egotistical, shallow, stuck-up, posh b*tch" etc. Even that I can put up with to some extent.      But now, on facebook, shes added my boyfriend from out of school who she knows I am very close to. Not realising who she was, he accepted her, and now thinks shes nice, and keeps talking to her, while she keeps leaving b*tchy comments about me on his wall which are not true. The audacity of her to do this, as at school, she has called him all the things she has called me. She keeps just getting invlved in my life too. She wants to know who im talking to, where im going, what im doing, and she wants to have what I have. I suspect she's jealous, but I don't know.      What should I do? I panick about things and I cried for something like 8 hours over this :( Please help??      Thanks xxxx

20090221021211AASCOHI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls Only....Love advice?	Hi girls, i am a little confused and need help figuring this out. I like this guy named John and so does my friend Jenna. Heres the deal:   We kind of both just met john, and the other night john invited me out to this concert close to my house, and after the concert we shared our first kiss...it came out of no where (we were both kind of drunk) but not to the point where we didnt know what was going on. Anyway, so last night was John's best friend Erick's birthday and me and Jenna both went because we kind of all hang out with the same group of friends....Jenna found out about the kiss from Erick and she kind of looked upset because i think she likes him too. She seemed so jealous and she kept coming up with reasons why John is not for me, like she is all "he is such a player, and he likes mature girls etc." The whole night last night i wanted to have some alone time with John but Jenna kept literally tugging me away and like we ended up going to some random bars (she was like doing everything in her power to get me away from him) He was even putting his arm around me and she got jealous and like pulled me away. Anyway, later that night we all get back to Ericks house and on the ride back she loures John in the balcony and starts flirting with him and like grabbing him all flirty and ****. It really pissed me off because she knows i like him and she was the one who told me in the first place that she is looking for someone so different from John. I couldnt handle being there because they both looked so in to eachother and i just couldnt be there so i left when no one was looking. What would u have done if u were me, would u have stayed?   The part that makes me sad is i think john is falling for jenna because she has had soo much one on one time with him and like everytime he comes to talk to me she like magically finds a way to make me disappear.   Help me! i feel so heart broken =(

20090221023045AA4WCEo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should I wait for him?	A good friend introduced me to his cousin who was visiting my city on a holiday. Had his heart set on moving to my city for work.   Applied for some jobs while he was here and had several interviews, which he thought went well.    We got a long great during his visit and he asked me if I would like to begin a relationship, since we really enjoyed each others company, and he would be moving here shortly. I normally don't rush into things like this, but since we didn't want to let each other go, we agreed to be together and see how things go. He ended up getting rejected for all the jobs he applied for. But he told me he would come visit me as soon as possible, and that I should send him my holiday schedule. We live in different continents, however, and I don't know what to do.   Neither of us have brought up the topic of "us". We are still technically together and talk every 2-3 days. He recently got a new job, although he accepted it with reluctance (a job is better than none in this financial crisis). Since he is working a new job, it is unknown when his boss will give him a break to come visit me. Every time he talks he says he will see me soon but doesn't know when. I havent seen him in 2 months. How long should I wait? I really like him but at the same time, I don't know what he's thinking about our relationship.

20090221052748AAr4Hf8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband cheating through emails?	I have found before when he has left his email account open that he was chatting and emailing back and forth with several different women when confronted about it he said that he had a problem with being friends with women and not speaking to them that way. He said he would stop and go to counseling which he did all of about two times. Now things are different in our relationship, I don't feel like I am in love with him anymore because of all the things that have happened. He doesn't tell me ANY of his passwords to anything and he is VERY careful now not to walk away from his computer without locking it.       How can I find out if he really is still doing it? Now he is a VERY smart guy when it comes to computers that is what he does for a living and would know right away if I tried to put a keylogger on or something like that...   Thoughts???

20090221053458AAX2i9k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Plz help me here, i need it big time!?	I've known this girl for almost 2 years now, but i would say in the past 6 months though she given me signs such as...   - she calls my cell phone out of the blue   - she really wants to know what I'm doing   - she'll talk to me on the phone for hrs even if shes tired   - she’s asked me a countless number of times to go out with her for dinner/movie   - gave me her face book & msn password   (she doesn't really seem to care as much anymore)      Here's where it gets a lil' odd (and I know im an idiot here). I met her online and even though were 3yrs apart, we both live in the same city...about 10mins away by drive and she works a few stores down from me. We have never met once..      Since September even though she still seemed to care, things haven't been the same. During Christmas I bought her a present & flowers to show her how much I did care for her but before I gave it she told me she loves him. Let me add by the way, this ex b/f physically hit her, raped her and treats her like crap. Obviously i'd be turned off by a girl who kept mentioning her ex b/f.      now lately she's been really rude with me and we both cut off each other, but I was curious to see why she was...So I went on her facebook account and found this...Plz read this      ---- msg from her to her ex ------   i cant be ur ***** anymore ok   and u cant give me wut i want   i deserve better den the way u treat me   u tellin me ur goin to new york on valentines day jus broke my heart ok   i planned dat we wud go out on saturday, and i bought u kitkat and frerror rocher choclates cuz u told me they r ur fave   and i was gnna get u more but den my friend stopped me and said why r u doing this i bet he doesnt even care, and u kno wut i slapped her and bitched at her and came home. and now i realise she was rite. a person like u who cudnt come see me wen i jus lost his baby, means nuthin to me anymore, u kno wut ye we cud have had a baby together do u understand that? its not a small deal. we have been thru a lot. i give u everythin to keep u happy. but at the end of the day u kick me away like a rock.       im jus not that type ok. i've had enuf. i kno u dont love me and i kno u hate me and i kno u jus wish i wud somehow and btw if u did so mmuch for ur ex. bought her a promise ring, and gifts and took her out, den why not for me?u went out wid me longer den her is it cuz im ugly cuz doesnt seem like it there are enuf guys who ask me out everyday u kno how many freakin ppl msg me everyday tellin me they like me or guys from skool, or friends or etc, i can be wid any one of em but no i chose to be wid u. on my birthday u came to see me to have sex, i asked u to et me ice cream u didnt even do that, on our one year anniversary u called me 7 in the evening and didnt do **** for me, on new years i was da one who called u to say happy anniversary, on ur birthday i gave u a gift that i took forever to find and u promised u wud wear it forever, i saw it on ur wrost once and den never saw it again. and now valentines day and ur goin to newyork awesum. guess i was wrong.       ur jus a cheapass who cant think of anyone but himself. feel free to delete my number from ur phone and i wont be seeing ur face again. wish u the best in life and hope u find a girl, and dont treat her like **** like u did wid me, because trust me no one is gnna last wid u. i fukin compromised wid u enuf arite no one does that these days. they all whores out there and im tellin u i was fukin clean wen u met me and i was pure and i never did **** wid no one ok. good luck finiding someone like that in ur lifetime. but w.e. why am i wastin my time talkin to a brick wall that doesnt respond nor does it care bout ppls feelings.    i was always too good for u   and u kno it   peace ;         I thank anyone who actually read this entire thing now in ur opinion do i fully walk away from her for good or wut cuz part of me feels like helping her but i'm not sure...

20090220223017AAUh9I3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please help!  I need advice badly!?	Hi, my fiance and I are both in college.  I have a job but he doesn't, so frequently, I have to help him with his bills.  I help him with car payments, lights and gas bills, and I pay for his internet and phone monthly.  I also buy him groceries. Now, I don't mind doing this because I feel that if we are getting married, this is something that we're going to do anyway, so why not start now?  The problem is, he doesn't seem to appreciate it, and it's never enough.  He is very high maintenance, so when I buy his groceries, I can't buy off brand stuff...he has better food in my house than I have in my own...all bought with my money.  Also, for gifts for events like birthdays or Valentines, he requests things like expensive colognes or clothing...and it's really starting to add up.  I, on the other hand, didn't get a thing.  I wouldn't mind this so much, IF he were appreciative, but he isn't.  He talks to me real badly sometimes, yet when he needs something, he is sweet.  I don't know what to do...I am tired of paying his bills and trying to pay mine too, and him acting like a jerk.  What do I do?  I know some of you are going to think that I am stupid for doing all this; however, he is my future husband, and I love him so much...I just can't really afford him.  How do I tell him he needs to stand on his own two feet?  I can't just not help him at all, but his expensive tastes are killing me.  What can I do?

This past valentines day, I finally tell her that I love her. She said "oh I thought you just wanted to be friends with benefits". Now she's like "I enjoy your company. Should we stop kissing and hugging (and sex)?" How can she be so robotic? Anyhow, over time I've fallen for her. She says she doesn't want a relationship now. That she doesn't feel love for me. That she WOULD get jealous if I dated another girl, but would accept it quickly. She doesn't expect us to ever go far, but she enjoys talking to me, she enjoys me physically, and sees me as a close friend.       What the hell do I do? I love this girl but now I obviously don't want to love her anymore. I want to see it all the way she sees it.

20090220234700AAOdJEl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Awkward question about sex kinda...?	Not sex but its least dangerous simulation: dry humping i guess you'd call it?

Because we aren't having sex or any variation because we believe its wrong to before marriage, but every once in a while we slip up and dry hump, ugh stupid name for it, which still isn't good but at least nothing is happening, or at least i thought. lately through certain sounds and motions i get the sense its going further than it should and so i was wondering if a girl would likely orgasm from this type of stuff or if maybe its like a precursor um happening that she feels... i dunno, but neither of us have had sex before so maybe she hasn't had an orgasm and misconstrues the lead-up feelings as one, whew, ive babbled enough, just educate me a little please   its kinda embarrassing asking this

Somewhere out there, there is a girl who is perfect for him, who can give him the time he needs, be there for him, who is strong enough, a girl who is going to be able to give him everything he needs without the emotional baggage. I'm not that girl. Even though I love him, I feel like I will end up hurting him, and I never wanted that. How do I end this? I can't even think about walking away with breaking into tears. And what makes this even worse is that this is a long distance relationship.

20090221002553AAvqWk7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I make this right?	I've been with the same guy since March 2004 and we've only been married since August 2008. We've maybe had 3 big fights in all those years. Lately things have just seemed more on edge to me, he got laid off and it made things worse overall. He says he feels like I don't ever want to go anywhere and do stuff with him. I admit we don't go out alot but we don't usually have the extra money anyways. Also there are other things...if he wants to be intimate and I don't want to, then he gets all mad at me and later tells me he feels like I don't love him because I rejected him. I tell him everyday that I love him and I try to give him enough affection  but I feel like I'm on nails with him and knowing how he is going to act if I say no makes it undesirable to me.       Then today we got into a fight about going to a flea market, we were headed out to shop and the next thing I know we are turned around going home and as soon as we get inside he grabs a bag and puts clothes in it and says he can't do this anymore. He said this isn't going to work and he is tired of the fighting and that I never go anywhere with him and that we would break up sooner or later so why not do it now. I was just pretty shocked, I thought it was a pety argument. But he was serious...he was very upset. I tried to talk to him and let him know I loved him but all he could say is we can still be friends and what do you want to do with the house?      I do love him and I want to be with him, but what can I do to make him understand?? I don't know if he truely feels I don't love him or if this is all just an excuse to leave me?      I'm hurt and confused. I know I need improvement too but I need him to tell me what I'm doing wrong when it happens and not hold it inside and blow up at me months later.

I also think that after i reject them they might start talking crap about me. ugh girls... any suggestions or ideas, because up untill now avoidance hasn't been exactly easy.

20090221012711AAd1kPr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce Advise- Contested Divorce?	I got married in September 2006 in India to a person holding h1b visa and .Here is my situation. I am on H4 and my spouse is on H1 Visa. After coming here in USA, We filed our Green Card ( He is Primary Applicant on EB3 Category with Approved I140), I got the Emloyment authorization Document (EAD). I started working on my EAD but now things are not working between us and I came to know that he got married to me to take ecconomic advantage of me and he used me to pay all his Debt( Credit card and Property).He never loved me. My in laws were keep torturing me and my parents. There were not allowing me to commnicate with my parents in india and if I do, thats nightmare...Till now I was trusting on him blindly and giving all money I earned and He was having total control over all my finances and bcoz of that 1. I do not have any financial security at this moment... 2. He have not renewed my EAD card on time and I lost my job. He cheated me.      Based on my limited knowledge, Please let me know what options are available to me.      I would like to know following:      1. Where should I file for Divorce : In India or In USA?   2. Should I go for contested or uncontested divorce? ( FYI...To file contested divorce in USA, I do not have money as he used all my earning to pay his debts. Is there any free legal help available in USA for immgrants like me)   3. Can my husband withdraw only my green card application and get my EAD cancelled during the period that the divorce proceedings are in the court?   4. CAn I get some protection from getting my EAD cancelled?   5. If my EAD is cancelled, I will be on H4 visa and therefore will not be able to work. In such a case can I get any temporary work permit to sustain myself during the proceedings of the divorce case and to fight contested divorce?   6. Are there any other visas which I can apply for?   7. If I plan to go to India and file contested divorce there as I dont have ecconomic resource to file it here...Can I do that  and how much time does it take in India?            Any piece of advice would be highly appreciated.
20090221012802AAuJzg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im a little confused......................… grader?	My mom recently told me about sex and I was wondering if girls can do it with girls to make a baby or guys and guys. She also told me when I feel like trying something related to it, I can use my finger and put it in my private. Will my finger get slimy, and smell bad? Will I get pregnant or does that have to be with my boyfriend, Tommy, who's in 5th grade? My mommy told me about a weener on a boy. I want to see Tommys weener. What does it look like? Send me a picture please. I'm just wondering. Thanks
20090221013114AAJU95j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In need of advice. I would appreciate any help..?	At the beginning of my junior year I met this amazing girl who I have developed a major crush on.Most boys my age wouldn't think she is "hot", but I think she beautiful.She's smart, funny, hard working, and really nice. We have two classes,English and History, together during the day. I've always been a quiet person so at first we didn't really talk.      Now after a few months, my crush and I are a lot closer, but I'm still a little shy around her ( I cant, help it really). We are closer, but so is my friend and her. This situation makes me feel very frustrated because everyday I  impatiently wait for my English and History classes for a chance to see her and talk to her, but she pays more attention to my friend. Every day she says "Hi Alex" with a smile and stare that make me melt inside;she holds the stare and I try to do it too, but like a little kid I turn somewhere else. I love to see her face blush when the both of us are talking and to pretend that I don't notice her looking at me. I thought she liked me,but lately she and my best friend flirt with each other so much that I feel like I was just kidding myself. My friend is a lot more outgoing than myself so its easier for him to talk to her more. She teases him, she hits/ touches him playfully, and he makes her laugh a lot.I feel really bad for being jealous of my best friend who has been my friend since the 5th grade and who I love very much, but its just that I really like her.So instead of going home happy and hopeful everyday, I alternate between hopeful and sad every other day.       I don't know what to do. Just 3 days ago my friend was absent and I had one of the best days of my life. Her and I talked a lot, I saw her blushing face, we walked to our next class together after out of nowhere she pushed me and just smiled after.But now sometimes I feel she doesn't like me and is just being friendly.       Do you guys/ girls think there's a possibility she might like me?Should I move on? Any advice is appreciated. I apologize for the long "question" sorry..

If you read my last question:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Okay, he came to my apartment just now and he was completely wasted.  I opened the door and he leaned in close enough to kiss me and kept pushing me towards my room.  So, he pushed me on my bed and laid down next to me and started talking to me about how I am a slut and that I'm "not good in bed" but I dont know if he was joking so I went with it.      The he told me I am fat (I weigh like 105 pounds) and that I should lose weight so I can get a husband.  He took my pillow and put it up his shirt and was like, "Ha, I'm Carmen"      So, he got up and said to either go into his apartment when I knock or don't go in at all because he doesn't like that our neighbors look at us because two went to him last night (I got drunk and apologized to him about the other night) and asked him if we are having sex.       WTF! I've never been this confused in a relationship.  And we're not even dating!!!

This makes me feel sick writing this but i'm 16 and i went to party last night, it wasn't big it was a party of 9 but i got VERY wasted and i was pretty high too (i know drugs & alcohol are bad..). Anyway, so all of the guys there were friends of mine and one guy was with me some of the night and he was pretty sober. He kissed me while we were by ourselves knowing how drunk i was and then asked me to give him head so i did. Then i made an excuse and left the room, later i was in a room by myself sleeping (this was about 5 am) and he came in (from what i can remember) and asked me to suck him off again, then after that he was kissing me and took down my tights and pretty much tried to have sex with me (I'M A VIRGIN AND HE DIDN'T HAVE PROTECTION!) he's a virgin too and WAY less experienced than me but now that i've sobered up i feel sick to my stomach like i was taken advantage of. I can't even touch myself i feel so dirty and disgusting, i don't think i can ever look him in the eye again and i don't know what to do!

20090221024205AA4gRWa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend problem Please Help?	Can someone please help me? I've been with this girl for 1 and a half years and most of it has been amazing. We know for a fact we have found the perfect mates in each other. But one thing bothers me. It's really confusing and want to ask if I'm thinking too much or I have a point. I went on her facebook account a long time ago and this guy left her comments 4 months before I met her. He would call her "baby" and say "I love you" and drew a picture where they both are on a bed and has their names arrowed in on the figures. For a while, I just looked at him as a stalker of her. Then I went on her account, and saw her comments and they were responsive. Things such as "I love you baby" or "You won't ever leave me right" or "No one could do it like you". But mind it this was before I came in her life. But right after I came in, I still see him call her "Baby" and say "I love you". She gets back and calls him "Boo" "Baby" and "You are So Sexy". I never had confronted her about it because I thought if I did, she would be looking at me as an immature individual. But after seeing their back-and-forth's, I think she's immature. She talked briefly about him a while back and said that he said we will last 3 months and that's it. That showed me he doesn't like us together. I finally confronted her about it and she said that he was a close friend before and still is but not as much as before and he is the cousin of her ex. He did like her but she said he likes everybody. Also, she said I have called girls baby before so I shouldn't get at her. I questioned her straight up and asked when and who did i call Baby and she didn't answer. She still says "I miss you" "I love you" and "Baby". She said she loves him as a friend. Also, she said "Baby" was stupid of her but I said it even though I never called another girl "Baby". Now my question is that am i over-reacting? Do people call others baby and say they are sexy and I love you frequently? I'm not saying she is cheating because I know she loves me a lot but is she still immature in this aspect? She's 19. This really bugs me and every time I see them exchanging comments, I don't get a good feeling. I do trust her but after reading this, who do you think is more at fault. Me or her? Please help me out. Thank you

20090221055419AAH0O5l	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister is moving back in, what do we do?	ok so my sister is moving back home with her baby because her husband is in the army and will be gone for a year. Im really happy but we dont know where to put her because she has a baby now so she will need more room. we either have 2 bedrooms or she could sleep in the basement (we would get it fixed up) She kinda wanted to take the basement so she can kinda be on her own, but me and my mom orignally were hoping to move me into the basement  because i have 4 ferrets and a monkey and i wanted to put my ferrets in the one small extra room we have in the basement so they could room loose a few hours a day, and my monkey would be able to run around freely since we cant keep her near the baby (for safety reasons obviously)   also since im homeschooled i would have room for my desk, computer, etc. and in the basement we have tons of hooks on the wall so we could put rope toys and stuff for my monkey to play on, also as of right now the basement would NOT be healthy for my sisters baby and even though we are gonna clean it shes moving in a few weeks so were worried it wont be safe enough for a baby to sleep in. i measured the basement and the 2 rooms are actually bigger put together then the basement. the only good thing about my sis being in the basement though is she could be more on her own. but at the same time if she plans on being upstairs with us then it would make more sense for her and her baby to be upstairs so she doesnt have to go up and down the stairs all day to get her baby or put her to bed, etc.   as of right now the basement is kinda gross cuz ours cats use to pee down there and there are spider webs so idk how clean we can possibly get it in time for the baby, but on the other hand my sister said she could use some of her money to help fix it up since she wont be paying rent anymore. sorry this question is so long we just dont know what to do,oh and btw my ferrets are going in the one room no matter what and my sis hates the smell of them so idk  why she wants the basment. but at the same time it might better if me and my sis arent constantly together so we wont fight so much lol   we dont know what we should do, both ideas sound equally good cuz even though there are a lot more reasons i should stay in the basement it might be nice for my sis to be a little more on her own you know?

20090221032817AANlWfn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she just using me!?	My family has a lot of money and can afford to go out for dinners all the time and go on holiday a lot. I have this friend, we used to be really close and go out shopping and to the movies all the time, but since we met through school, she didn't know I was so 'well-off'.    After a few months of us hanging out, I invited her for a sleepover at mine which meant her seeing my big house and nice things. After that we still spent a lot of time together, our families started calling us 'twins' because we were so close.    But now we've been seeing less of each other. On monday, I'll ask her to come over at the weekend, and she'll say she can't because she says she's busy or that her moms working and can't give her a lift. Then later in the week (like wednesday or thursday) I'll mention that (since she's busy) I'm going out with the family, on a day trip or something, and suddenly she's free and wants to come along.    Is she using me?

It happened as I did not meet a guy that I honestly thought it would last with. I live a responsible life, have a job which keeps me and allows me to travel now and then. I have many friends and don't take drugs or alcohol. In other words, really I live a moral life. Do you think that I am seen as cold as I didn't just settle down and become a wife and Mother? By the way, I am not gay, I like guys, but just know that many marriages break and don't want that for myself. Luckily, I get asked out as I take care of my appearance.

20090221030105AAVABY3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I find guys who smoke a big turn on. Is that normal?	Hi There, I am a 16 year old girl. I started smoking when I was 12. I have been trying to quit lately without much success, as I have already been smoking up to 3 packs a day. I am desperately trying to cut down as much as possible as I cannot quit cold turkey. Bit now I have  a weird problem. I have begun noticing that I find cute smoking guys a big turn on. I don't know why but I myself find it ridiculous. There are a lot of good looking non smokers out there but It seems that I am not attracted to those guys. I only attracted to the fact whether he's a smoker or not. This is something I completely do not understand because this started happening ever since I had resolved to quit smoking. As though the urge for smoking is not enough, now this! I don't know where I am going wrong. I am trying to bring my life to the right track by desperately trying to quit smoking but now this is a new thing that I have become obsessed about. Am I losing my pebbles. Do you think its just the smoking pangs which are getting the worst of me. Do you think that I should be getting medical help. Please advise.

20090221035829AAJjeKo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she likes me?	So there's this girl in my class i've had a crush on for a while, and I think she likes me, but I'm not sure so I thought I could get some advice here.   I sit in front of her in French class, and every class me and her start talking, and we talk so much tot he point that the teacher sometimes changes the seats of one of us. We also tend to hold hands a lot, link arms and she even pretends that I'm her boyfriend, and it's so convincing that some of our teachers and friends thought we really were going out. We're also really close when it comes to the "touch barrier", I mean, I sometimes hold her from her waist against me, I kiss her in the cheek all then time, I hug her a lot also, and she likes to put her head on my shoulder in class. She also likes to give me these little bites, and when I turned 17, which was like 3 days ago she said she would give me a kiss as a present, and that I could pick the place. And I also happen to know that she thinks I'm the 2nd best looking guy in my class, 'cause she said it to a friend of mine. And I don't think she's being a flirt, because I have never seen her do anything even remotely close to the things we do with other guys.   The reason why I'm confused is that she once told in class to some of us that she only dates guys that are like, 18 or 19 years old (she didn't say it out of the blue, she said it because we were talking about stuff like that), and because I also think she is kinda out of my league ( it's not like I'm ugly, I mean I have blonde hair and blue eyes, but she is just absolutely beautiful). So, what do you think, does she like me?      BTW, I'm 17 and she is gonna be 18 in a month.
20090221051104AAHHSt5	Family & Relationships;Friends	I dont know whether I should say something to her or not?	My best friend emily (maybe not anymore) used to be so close. She then grew up a lot more than me and she looks 3 years older.       A boy in the year below us at school asked emily if he could have her number, after JUST breaking up with someone else.      Im really worried because she has just started seeing him, and he smokes weed and drinks out on the streets. She is trying to impress him, and has started drinking, and she has started to choose him over my group of friends.      She was never allowed to get msn by her parents, and she got it once, but then got rid of it because she felt so bad going against them. She now has got it again, and doesnt care about her parents because she wants to impress the boy.       what should I do?

20090221025320AAoQwcX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my Friend acting like this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarden and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. then when we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward to me.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         We also used to talk on AIM after I moved so we could stay in touch. Well, one day we just stopped talking. Then a few months ago I was being all silly trying to guess all my friends PWs. I actually got hers! I wasn't even on her Buddy List, no wonder we hadn't talked on there in so long! And the thing is, I have no idea when she took me off...      Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure?"      I reply, "Yes, I'm 100% sure you did. Don't you remember? You seriously don't remember?"      Then she says, "Not really, I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile on her and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      Why would sh

20090221045852AAs1TcN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How am i supposed to help her? She doesn't listen :S?	one of my best friends has had over ten boyfriends....and she is fourteen.....she usually dates guys that are 17, 18, even 19 and they are all jerks and all the same. so far this year she has had her heart broken three times since november, then comes crying to me asking "why do i always go after those type of guys, i hate guys they all auck, i am staying single forever!" but then two weeks later, she meets another guy and says "so ya we are going out :D" and this has happened so many times, i don't even say yay congrats i just say oh, and she looks hurt that i am not happy for her. I always ask her why she goes out with them, and she says that when she doesnt have a bf she really wants one, just for the sake of it? Outta all the bf's she has had she only really like one, the rest were just there. I talk to her tell her she doesn't need a bf and all that stuff, and she nods and says, you are right jasmin :), but then just goes back into her pattern? THen comes back crying to me?!?! I don't really understand it, especially with the guys...i don't wanna sound mean or shallow.....i lover er, but its not like she is the most in shape person in the world, she is over weight, and i just find it kinda odd that alll these guys ask her out, maybe i am wrong, put i thought most guys, especially the guys she dates, wanted a "hot" girl? but she does have a huge chest, maybe it has something to do with that, cause she don't mind showing it off by buttong her shirts down really low and hiking our school uniform kilt up really high? i just don't know what to tell her anymore? SHe never listens, i suspect it may be low confidence or self-esteem, but i dont know how to tell her things without sounding really mean ? :( HELP ME PLZ!!!

20090221042617AAGePXU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Should I say sorry?	My bf & I just had a bit of an arguement over the phone & now I don't know what to do.      Here's the situation:   We're together since 26th Dec 08 (but know each other since Aug 08). We're both 21. He's from Iran, but grew up in Irak, Greece & now lives in Switzerland since 1.5 years. I'm half Swiss, half British; grew up in UK, Israel, South Africa & now in Switzerland.    I'm virgin, he's not. I don't have a religion or anything, I'm not ugly (I guess) & I'm not intending to wait till marriage with staying virgin (since I want to marry with like 30 or so). It just didn't happen yet... maybe because the last time I had a serious relationship, I felt too young for it & after that my brother died & I was too sad & didn't feel like having any relationship + I didn't meet the right guy. I also have a bit of a trusting issue, since my ex-bf cheated on me.      Now my bf keeps saying he can wait till I'm ready. However he keeps trying to go further with me & when I tell him, I'm not ready yet, he gets mad & says, he doesn't understand why & that he's a man & it's hard for him to wait. & he says, that he has the feeling, it will never happen between us & that I just want to make him wait to "play" with him (which I swear isn't true!) & that I don't take this relationship serious, like, don't want to take it to the "next level" & that's why he thinks I don't want to have sex with him.   I honestly don't know why I'm not ready yet, but I'm just not & I don't know what to tell him or what to do? :(      Also, we don't see each other much. I work the entire day & have school in the evening & lots of homework & exams, because I'm intending to go to university soon. He has school every morning till 1 p.m. & works normally tuesday afternoon, sometimes also on other days (his boss calls him sponiously when he needs him).   Often I go to his working place at night, when he calls me to come, after I'm actually dead-tired from my working-day, just to see him quickly.   Once I told a friend off, because I thought I would see my bf on that saturday. & then my bf couldn't make it, because his friends mom had died & he had to stay with his friend (which I totally understand). I thought, we'd see each other the next day in the evening, because he kept saying we could probably see other & he'd call me. So I told another friend off & waited for his call. & then he called in the evening & said, he was the entire day with the friend, who had lost his mom, & after that he went home & slept a bit, because he was tired. I was a bit frustrated, because I had waited the entire weekend on him (& my free-time is very precious to me, because I don't have much of it & don't see my friends that often lately either), but accepted it.   Then 2 weeks ago I was in London. I knew, I wouldn't see my bf all week, so I kept my weekend free for him. & then he said, his brother, who had promised to go to another city to help his cousin move, had fallen ill. That's why he'd be going now instead of his brother, so we couldn't see us at all the entire weekend. Even though I was dead tired, because I had only slept like 4 hours, I went to the train station just to see him quickly & then back home in the middle of the night (& I also waited for him for like half an hour at -3° & I also needed 1h to get to the train station & then back home another 1h).   Then last Thursday, my school fell out (normally I would have had school in the morning & had to work in the afternoon). I asked my boss, if I could change my working time that day, so I would work in the morning & be free in the afternoon to see my bf, who also had free time in the afternoon. My boss wasn't exactly happy, but I managed to convince her. Then I waited at the train station that afternoon 35min in the cold outside for him to come. No phone from him, no sms or anything, but when he came, he told me, the teacher had made the school-lesson a bit longer, so he couldn't phone me or anything. However later on in the afternoon, his mom called him & told him, some friend of theirs was at home. So he told me, he had to go home. I was a bit disappointed, but accepted it again.   This weekend I promised my friend to go to the movies with her tonight (saturday night). My bf wanted me to cancel my date with her. But I told him, I had promised it to her long time ago & I hadn't seen her in ages. So, we won't see each other today, because he also left for another city (party of his friend is taking place there).   Last night he was also in another city at his friends place, so we didn't see each other either. I waited for his call. He phoned me at 12 o'clock last night & I was just sooo tired from work, that I had fallen asleep on the coach while watching tv at that time. I woke up from the call, but wasn't 100% awake, when we talked on the phone, so we said, we'd phone the next day. Then we phoned this morning. He said, maybe his family would be gone next weekend, so I could go sleep at his place next weekend. I said, o

20090221043815AAsqEFH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do other marriages have problems equal to mine?	I want to know if I'm not alone here. Kind of a two part question.            First every marriage has issues of some kind, they are not perfect and need work. I been with my husband since I was 17, i'm in my thirties now. We have both remained faithful and we DO love each other . Almost in way that that we are connected deep in our souls. Sounds corny, but I dont think we could be without each other and be happy people. Now I am an insecure person and he is a hard man to love, to be honest. He doesnt agree with how I go about doing even the most mundane chore and doesnt hold back his disapproval. Basically he talks to me like I am a moron, alot of the time. His upbringing wasnt good, and I have changed him for the better in alot of ways. He is a workaholic and stresses about money all the time. I am the closest person to him so I get it all taken out on me.         An example, this moring we were talking about when we went out with another couple the other week and he says, "you made yourself look really stupid". That hurt. In the course of conversation I may have said I'm simple and go with emotions. They were poking fun at my husband, saying he's a butt, and I did say that he treats me like I am a moron, and that I know I'm not the brightest person, but I aint no  moron. Sounds harsh, but it was all in a joking manner.       Second issue is I was chatting online, it was nice to talk to other adults about whatever. I told him and he got angry, so I stopped. One of the people I did talk to, contacted me and we have stayed in contact. Its nice to talk to a man that thinks only nice things about you. I have since cut the talk time down with him, cause I think he was feeling too much for me, and I said as married people thats not right. We can be friends and be flirty, but anything more than that is out of the question. Am I wrong for doing this? I did tell my husband when he said to stop chatting, that it was nice to have someone be nice to you, didnt take the hint apparently.      Having said all this, beleive it or not, we are satisfied with our life together, we are thrilled about our children, and like our rather simple life. I take his crap, because the good parts of him, the devotion, loyalty and such are so good. When he isnt stressing we do have fun together. Neither one of us ever wants a divorce, and in 15 years that word has never ever been mentioned.
20090221042645AAZzPA0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do? How can i make her talk to me again?	A girl i really like won't talk to me at the moment. How can i make her talk to me again? She won't talk to me in person, she doesn't reply to texts, she hangs up if i call her and she blocked me on myspace and msn. I was angry at her a couple of weeks ago so i did some dumb stuff to annoy her but she was angry at me before then. I haven't been able to talk to her in person for like a year because her friends hate me and she acts like she does too. However up and til about a month ago she would talk to me on msn (only msn though). However since i annoyed her  i'm blocked now. She was already angry at me before i annoyed her (i don't know why) and since she didn't seem to value me very much she seems happy to block me forever. What can i do?   A few days ago, some of her friends talked to me about her while she watched and they pretty much went across from me to her. The questions were mainly if i liked her and i said no which may have been the wrong thing to say (everyone knows i did/do though) and they claimed she liked me. I'm not entirely sure they told her what they asked me but i think so. She gives me angry looks and/or looks away when she sees me.       Sorry for the long question.
20090221035443AAA8kDE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is thing wrong? Please help?	Do you ever masturbate to photos of people you like? Without telling them?   Not particularly sexual photos but just regular photos. Myspace photos for example. Is this wrong?   Before someone mentions it, I am no way interested in discussing whether masturbation is wrong so if thats how you feel please just don't answer.
20090221041048AAlvbJg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does He Like Me? Im really Confused and Some Help Would Be Appreciated.?	Ok so I know there is loads of these questions on here but im very confused and need some help XD      Few months back I met this guy who I got on great with as a friend. He liked me a lot "in that way" and would text me and we talked loads and he asked me out..I'm a social phobic and I have never had a boyfriend because I wouldnt know what to do lol plus I'm not the most feminine of creatures..despite this he still asked me and I said no (yes im a heartless *****) but I didnt feel ready and thought that was more harsh. He said he would wait for me. I did and still do like him and after I said no we still spent lots of time together and we are more than friends. We made out a few times, which terrified me lol, and now he seems more distant..he still talks to me and we still see each other quite a lot like we cuddle lol i feel stupid writing this, but it feels different. Now I feel im maybe ready to go out with him or whatever but he says he doesnt want to rush anything. He knows how much I like him (and I really do) but doesnt say all the nice things he used to and will say he cant come over etc..although he says he does still like me a lot. What happened? Where did the guy go who was telling me he loved me and wanted us to be together? I know a lot of this is my fault but is there anything i can do to put this right?        Its a lot to take in I know but please help if you can..its killing me lol

20090221041637AAXhStm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife told me that she had been seeing a friend of ours for the last 3 years.?	She says there had been no sex but everything short of it! The only reason the relationship ended was because his wife found out and confronted her. I still love her and she says she still loves me but something has died. There are no hugs, kisses and I am in the guest bedroom. I feel very sad and would like things to be resolved positively, that is to rebuild a loving relationship. Where to start?
20090221031417AAPYGB6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's quit his live in job and is now living with my best friend and her mum! I'm really jealous?	I'm not usually a jealous girlfriend but I'm not quite sure how to take this. My boyfriend of a year and a half who I was sure I trusted completely got really down with his job. He lived there but he was getting really really depressed and needed a way out. My best friend (who admitted to me a while ago that she has strong feelings for him) and her mum appeared out of nowhere and said he could stay with them as long as he wanted to. My boyfriend asked me what I thought and said he wasn't sure, and I told him to follow his instinct, which was to get out of the place he worked asap. I didn't say no to him going, but when he accepted their offer, I began to get really put out - yesterday I watched as she hugged him continuously, stared at him non stop, sat in between us to split us up, tried embarrassing me in front of him, kept telling me how she was going to make him so much happier and they were going to have a lovely time etc. My boyfriend knows she likes him and said she has no chance with him because he loves me, but when you live with a girl wouldn't it be difficult to NOT start having feelings for her? Also, her mum's in on it as well - together they bought him a whole new range of clothes and said he wasn't going to wear his old stuff anymore because it was time for a 'change'. And all the while, my boyfriend's treating them like friends but he seems oblivious to what they're trying to do with him.      What do I do? What would you think in this situation?

20090221034246AAXGQ6b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: Do you think he likes me?	So there is this guy who I like, quite a bit and I don't think he likes me in return. Were in highschool, were going to a Debutante Ball together (I asked him), and our mutual friend tells each of us what the other one says; he called me hot and I called him hot and the next day we both knew what the other one had said. Anyway, he said "I want to get to know you better", is this a blow-off? Is he just being polite? Every time I talk to him it looks like he is pain, well not pain just more awkward, but we are both pretty shy so I don't know. We also talk on MSN all the time but the other night I said "hey" to him and we talked for like a second before he said he has to get off then he was on for like another half an hour. It's driving me insane! I feel like one of those creepy, obsessed wannabe girlfriends :S He also asked me for my mobile number, which i gave to him (and I have his), and he said he was going to text me but has no credit and then he got my home number to call from his house but he hasnt called me on that either. Is this just his way of saying "You have no f*cking chance with me? Go away!", cause I kind of feel like it is. And I totally hate it. Advice?      He asked me if I liked him, mind you I haven't known him for very long and I didn't want to sound creepy so I said "IDK, I dont really know you", I asked him if he likes me and he said "I dont really know you, maybe later :P". The other day I assumed nothing was going to happen between us and I took a very unhealthy approach and decided I hate him. I dont know what to do!      I dont know what to say, and I dont want to sound clingy by asking for his number. I hate high school :S Ahahahaha      Sorry that its so long.

20090221041834AAq6Ezd	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Just because movility advantages, we have to get married, but he doesnt really want to?	Well, this is complicated. A relationship of 3 years and half, lot of bad decisions (1ab)...besides,  we come from different countries which has been a pain in the neck in terms of finding the way to be together, legally speaking. We are in his country right now, but its been so difficult for me to find a job here and its been 6 months that I am here, (economical crisis, languages requirements, job market doesnt help) that we have the need to go somewhere else (well its actually more me, cause him, he has a job and stability, any way he is looking forward to move, cause he want to live anywhere else than his country) Then, after a very difficult discussion where I got to explain him how I feel about all this situation, that i just cant continue like this that I need us to make a decision, there was the topic about getting married in order to have more mobility to go some other country where there are better conditions for us to find a job quicker... his reaction: Its sad getting married by papers! I don't want to get married by papers! I want a wedding like everybody, planned with a year of anticipation... and all that. So, I said, that its not the ideal thing to do, that I know! to make a rushy civil wedding just for the sake of administrative requirements isnt the ideal! but if its in your plans to be with that person, then you do it, like many international couples do! But he sees that pretty much pretty horrible thing and he agreed to married, but forced by the idea that "or we get married or I have to leave". So, finally i said that there is no need to do anything that he doesnt want to do, that when you really love someone, then marryng her cant never be a something bad.      So I told him that we should leave it this big, and dont continue with this mess... I am very hurted, does this relation has to end? I am stuck.

20090221044118AAkwO7n	Family & Relationships;Family	Uhhh!!! I'm so MAD, I WANNA HIT SOMETHING!!?	My mom bough me something, I won't say what, they we had a fight, and then she took it away from me, and hid it. Then next day, when she was at work, I took the video game, and I replaced it with one I didn't like, and then that same day, I finished the whole game and found all coins in it. Then I started feeling guilty, so then, when she was at work, I decided to replace it back, put the original videogame, and I took the $12 dollars I put just in case she found out. When I was in the act, she opened the room, and came early from work. And started saying, why are you stealing the video game?? I was going to give it to you on Monday!!! But before that, I heard that the car was driving, I had two discs in hard, I was going to take the new the back then, so I popped one up in the box. And ran to my room, and that was when she started asking me this, She said that she found all the game manuals layed on her bed. Then I was all like, uhh... At least the game is still with me, and when I look at my hand, it was the crappy Bull#$^$ game I had, uhh she took it all... Its all her fault, if she wouldt have come early I would have gotten away with it!!! I HATE HER!!! Besides she makes my life inpossible, she doesn't even give me school money, she takes away my only happiness, screw family and friends!!! I want to throw a brick at her, and then make it land on her ugly face!!! What did I do to deserve this??!!! GOD HATES ME!!!

20090221044732AAiOL6P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are these boys normal or jerks?	i recently hung out with a couple of people i didn't know quite well. i tend to be shy for the first few times and then open up later, and some of them i had already hung out with at least twice before.       so there were 2 girls including me, and 4 guys.      we went karaoke, i thought it was alright, but there's this guy who had his hands down his pants pretending to jack off, then half way thru my friend started crying and the guys got really annoyed.       and now that everything's over all the guys keep sending me hate texts, telling me "u suck and ur friend's a retard, we're puking at the thought of u guys, u guys r so antisocial".      then i recently made up with one of the guys but he keeps putting me down and saying 'yeh we made a list, so according to so and so ur the most interesting of the girls we've met this yr, but i think you're at number 5 after so and so"      then he said "i hate women, they should just stay in the kitchen"      iv given up completely, there's more to it, including the fact that one of the guys did have a crush on me, he told me that night didn't change how he thought about me (along with other sweet things) and then i heard from all his friends he's bitched about me the most and that the guy who was jacking off didn't even want to talk about me because i was 'that antisocial'.       im confsued because i did talk to them and i thought it didn't go as bad as they thought it did.      what's up with them?      thanks for ur answers

20090221050436AAmER7I	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my sister treat me like a child?	Im up to here with my sister, she treats me like a child, yes I am 20, but she is only 24 herself. Im fed up of her attitute towards me.      Ive recently changed my name, in part because I dont want the name my parents gave me (due to an abusive mother I dont want assoiated with) and another is my own personal thoughts are that names are a description of who you are not who you parents want you to be and when I have kids I will teach them that.      Anyways she freaked out bout the name, i told her i understand her view and respect it but to leave it at that. she said I was acting like a teenager, like a child and I should grow up. When her, me and my dad was in Ikea, my dad was not well at all, he is old and its getting to him. She shooed my away so she could look after him and I wasnt allowed near him, he was my frikin father too!      she never seems to bother with me, I ring her, I ask her if she wants to meet up and she NEVER rings me to meet up or make an effort.       She is strong minded and very forceful in her views. Im fed up of it and I dont know what to do. I have a good relationship with one of my other sisters and I want that with this one, but half the time I wonder if I should just say forget it and not get involved with her anymore.       I may be 20 but I have my own flat, I goto uni and I am studing for a degree in architecture, I work and have a job. Im involved with the student union, I have ran the LGBT society for a year now! In my mind im if nothing a bit mature for my age. I want children (althought I have to adopt) and although I am not planning that for sometime as I want to provide for them the best I can, purly on my change of name she says I shouldnt have children.      I think that is the worst thing someone could tell another person, certinly the worst you could say to me, that someone does not have the right to be a parent.      Im at the end of my teather with her
20090221050537AAMkWQs	Family & Relationships;Friends	I fell in love with my friend! now she knew it, how will i react?	i am a student and an officer in our school org. there's this girl named Jane who used to my co-officer. we became real good friends, until i found out that i was falling for her, she has boyfriend for almost 3 years who is also a good friend of mine, so i decided to keep it a secret. we used to hang out together. almost every time.but she never know it until one time, i was out drinking with my other friends, eventually, i got really drunk and almost helpless. one of my friend took me on a room to rest. i was so unconscious of everything i said that time, until three days later,  jane confronted me if what she found out was true. she said that i got so drunk and i was talking and calling her name, that i told everybody that i love her so much etc. i cud hardly remember everything but i know it was true. i got so scared that we might loose our friendship, i asked her how did she knew it. she said that she was beside me all the while that time happened.

We've just started having sex, twice so far and both times he said it felt really good and tight however he hasn't yet been able to *** and he doesnt have any problem getting there when I'm giving him oral or doing anything else.  Is it just because we're both relatively new to having sex? or is there a real issue here? Maybe he's really paranoid about getting me pregnant?

20090221054026AA1KTcM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies can i get your thoughts?	I am 23, and i have been dating my gf for almost 3 years. Well i have always been the giver in the relationship i guess and it hasnt botherd me that much but lately i have been getting tired of it. For example: yesterday i left work and drove streight to her house which is an hour away. I got there and quickly ate, cause we were going to the movies in 2 hours and her parents were not home :)  Well i run and shower and come back down and try to start "somthing" well she asked me for a back massage, im really good at them i make it into a 15 min ordeal, anyways i give her one and than when i try something she says her parents are home so i rush to put my cloths on. Well her parents didnt show up for another 2 hours. But i didnt think it was that big of a deal, so she went back to doing what she had been doing all day, playing on the computer. Well i got ready and when i told her to shut it off cause we were leaving she said that she felt tired all of a sudden and didnt want to go. Also i went down there to borrow a piece of equipment for my work that she said she had, one of the main reasons i went down there, but when i got down there she said she thought they had it but they didnt. And then i had to get up at 6:30 so i could drive an hour to be at work on time. Than she is curious as to  why i was grumpy last night.  Am i over reacting or what. i believe a relationship should be equal for the guy and girl. But latly i feel like i am carrying the team.     O she has a few medical issues but nothing life threatening idk if that affects her mood or not.

20090221051258AApFER1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some advice on my girlfriend?	Ok. Basically. Im 23 and my girlfriend is 19. Im kind of old i know but this is my first real relationship and only girl ive been intimate with. my girlfriend is very sexually experienced. I know she cares about me and we have dated for about 4 months now. But the past two weeks it has been my birthday and it was valentines day and we have not had sex at all. Is this normal for a girl of her age especially on my birthday and valentinnes day not to sleep with me especially if she knows i wanted to. She said she didnt want to force herself. I get the feeling that im not satisfying her and she might  be cheating on me cause we went from having alot of sex to no sex. Annd everytime we go out, shes always getting mad at me. Like saying she hates the way i walk, and weird thing was yesterday at the movie theater she yelled at me because i was eating popcorn before the movie started cause she said i would finish it. i dont know shes always nagging and always messing with my head. I love the girl, but i dont know whats normal cause i havnt been in  alot of relationships and just want to make sure shes not cheating. thanks for  the advice. Oh yeah and yesterday at the pub she was like theres somebody else and i want to break up with you and started laughig. But i know when a girl laughs its a sign of stress. and shes like you gonna cry in public. shes like ive been wanting to break up for 2 weeks. Than shes like just kidding I wanna marry you. You know what they say 90 percent of some jokes have some truth. I just want to make sure everything is ok. She said she was joking but could that be a test or i dunno. Just need some advice.
20090221051325AAd7mxi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still have feelings for me or should i move on?	okay so me and my ex boyfriend broke up on VALENTINES DAY.   long story short he was basically acting really different towards me.   and i have a feeling it was because in school he's more of a kid thats known and im the new kid to the school and like i remember people i went to middle school with but i hardly talk to them i stick with my own friends and like i guess he didnt like that and wanted me to be knownor some crap. like he would call me a lame because i wore my school id? why would i not wear it and get sent to in school suspension for a day for? smh.      so yeah i commented him one day before valentines day ..   telling him how i felt because he didnt have a phone and i basically asked if he was with me or not ....   he didnt comment back he just changed his name on myspace that would give me a hint that we were over.   so i was like w,e fck him.      but after school i have to stay by his house all day until 8.   thats a long story i dont wanna get into lol.   but like he;s basically right there all the time .   we dont talk to each other its just an awkward silence.   he puts in his ipod and plays video games and i put in my ipod.   like he says hi occassionally. i never bother too,   but on wednesday i was talking to my guy friend in front of my ex's house and my ex came home and like he knew the guy and he said hey to him and i didnt hear when he said whats up to me ... so it looked like i completely ignored him . so thursday i was walking my friend to class and i see him walking with this girl holding onto his arm he looksat me then looks away...   asshole.   like its so hard moving on cause hes always around .   i bet he didnt care at all.   his aunt was checking her phone and saw some text messages to some person and she thinks it was him sending those messages to some girl and one message said    "so we can be alone"   and it wasnt my number cause he didnt never texted me when we were dating. which is understandable because when my phone was off his phone was on and when my phone turned on his phone turned off.   ahhhhhhh i hate this.

20090221054107AAGzvt0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is the girl of my dreams cheating on me?	Okay as you may already know , Im gay. Ive been in a relationship for a year and a half. I started thinking my fiance was cheating on me when i found nasty text messages in her phone. I told her that she wasn't aloud to talk to the girl who they were from and she swore she wouldn't.About 7 months in she told me she had feelings for someone else. This crushed me. Then about 8 moths into a relationship she says she wants "to take some time off". Then a couple days later i asked her if she was seeing someone else and she lied to me an told me no. I went to her house to work things out and see where i stand with her and she had the nerve to tell this girl she loved her before she got off the phone. I wrote her a 5 page letter and when i heard her say that i threw it in her face and walked out of her house. She ran down the street and caught me. She cheated on the she lied to me with. She was all over me. So then we got back together and i find out that she had sex with the girl she WAS with and she didn't tell me. Then i hear while shes with me she was caught holding hands with someone and kissing someone else.   Now i asked her if this was true and she told me no. I wanted to believe her but then again tree people who don't really like my girlfriend were the ones wh told me . Along with her ex's.    So i asked her about if several times and i keep hearing "that's my story and i'm not changing it". She did tell me she was going to change and she swore on her family with me.she would.   Who do i believe and is she cheating?

20090221055602AA5VQBL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marraige fraud...what should she do?	I have a really good friend who wants to marry a Trinidadian man. I liked him a lot until I found out that he had married another american girl (with her consent because of a financial agreement) just for the papers.  But my friend assures me that this time it's for love.        However, when they went to begin proceedings for the divorce to the previous marriage...lo and behold...she discovers that he is indeed NOT married.  Apparently, although the paperwork was complete, the guy never showed up to get a judge or minister to sign the documents.        Does this not seem a little fishy to you?  Is he just luring her into a green card marriage?
20090221060218AAjEh96	Family & Relationships;Friends	Something more or friends with benefits ?	I really like this guy and we've met up once and it went really well. However, I dont know if im just a girl on the side or someone hes really into. People say to me hes a bit dodgy and stuff and he said he wasnt that keen on a girlfriend. He also hasnt had a very serious relationship. He seems really into me though. He once said 'how about we keep seeing each other in a 'friendsy' way and see what happens. Does that mean he wants to be serious? Part of me gets a really bad vibe from him and the other just thinks its going well. I really have no experience with people like this because we talk all the time and i like him more everyday. I just dont think i know enough about him to find out what he really wants out of this.

20090221060606AACtanU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was she just being nice?	For Valentines Day I sent my friend that i'm interested in a dozen roses with a note that said "Will you go out with me?" We've been friends for almost 7 yrs now. One of my closest friends and i'm the same with her. We probably go and hang out once a month or so. Dinner usually and maybe some activity.      At first she didn't believe I was being serious (cause sometimes I would joke about us being together). But I told her that I did have feelings for her and was serious about it.      Her first answer was something along the lines of "I'm thinking maybe, but you know i'm trying to work some things out"      She's been in therapy for a few months. About a year ago she got back with her ex, and said he was different then before. Long story short it ended up he wasn't any different.      So I give her a few days to think about it and asked her if she had an answer and here's what she said      "well i think i want to keep things the way they are right now, you know i have some things im trying to work through. and i would hate to start something and it not work out and then our friendship is ruined"      I didn't think about it until two days later but do you think she was trying to let me down easy? Or do you think I have a chance if I were to ask her again later.      And it hasn't been weird or anything. We still talk the same. Actually we've talked more frequently since i've asked.
20090221060606AAJSf6Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do about my 17 year old boyfriend smoking too much pot?	When I first met him he had just started experimenting with marijuana, as was I. I don't have anything against it if it doesn't get out of hand. Eventually he got to the point where he and his buddies were smoking every day. And soon enough, he got caught by his parents. They were extremely upset and he was grounded for a while. He said that he knew it was getting out of control so he stopped smoking all together for about a month, and he said he felt great and so much more healthy. He said that from then on he would basically do what I used to do, which was smoke occasionally in certain social situations. But eventually he went right back to his old ways and now he's back to smoking every day. He talks about how he wants to cut back, especially for financial reasons. But his best friends are so into it, that it's really hard for him to remain friends with them and not smoke so much. But I hate having to deal with him high all the time. I feel like I'm talking to a different person, and I really don't like that. So what should I do?       And please, no lectures on marijuana, I know about the stuff. And I really don't think there is anything wrong with occasional use of it.

20090219173916AAQpWFb	Family & Relationships;Family	Wanting to quit but afraid to tell my parents...?	I started guitar lessons about 5 months ago and its going alright so far. But, i kind of want to quit. My parents are having a little trouble with money and what not right now, and i think that i don't need to be in lessons. What i mean is, its just a hobby. I can always learn more another time. Besides, i have been teaching myself some things like songs and stuff.    I don't know what to do because im afraid to ask my parents to stop lessons because they are going to ask why and i don't want them thinking that the money issue is forcing me to quit. Its not forcing me to, i just think that it will help them. If they know that's why, then i don't think they will want me doing that. I know this sounds kind of stupid but i don't know what to do. Help me please!

We had a big argument we made up after that & i didnt hear from him & i didn’t contact him either & 2day he called me after a few weeks & he was acting like nothing is happened he was just asking me how am doing & i told him to call me back later cos i was busy. Why is he calling me(don’t say sex cos there’s no way am having sex with him) after we argued & made up & everything was fine & ignored me 4 such a long time.. Am soo confused.   ? WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?   ? WHAT DO I DO NOW?   ? WITH HIM HE DOESNT TALK TO ME MUCH LIKE I WOULD WANT TO.    (He was like a close book)         After a few months he changed & became very distant, went calling me much & he would argue and yell at me all the time. When we made up everything was ok then he went very distant again and wasn’t calling me at all & i ring him and said ive miss him & that i wanted see him he wasn't straight forward on when i would see or he would yell at me on the phone.       He said i was cheating on him when ive been totally devoted to him he said i was taking him for granted when i wasn’t. I felt really bad that he didn’t know how much he meant to me. he wanted reassurance all the time. He totally changed & i was very confused & he made out like everything was my fault saying i was the 1 that’s changed & i was questioning myself to much i was soo stressed out i was going crazy.

20090219171850AAQKxtL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you solve trust issues?	My love and i have been together for 3 years. we have a little girl together and have been through any and every possible scenario thats worthy of a break up but we've managed to get thru it all. We're both fairly young. 19 and 20. but dont let our age mislead you. Having a child forces you to grow up and grow up quick. Me, a little faster than him though. :/       i dont want to make him look like the bad guy bc i too have done some pretty Sh**ty things but he's done worse. :'(      sadly , although we've managed to stay together not bc we feel obligated to but bc we indeed love each othr very much...it definately has taken its toll on us.      bottom line....We Dont Trust Each Other For Shi**.      i hate it.   forgiving and forgetting is easier said than done.      is there anyone who has tips or advice on fixing our trust issues with each other.?      i could use all the advice i can get. i dont want to lose him....our family...our possibility.   :/

20090219175016AAXXePM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Don't want to hang out with friend....?	I have a really good friend I ride the bus with and talk to every morning before school.    I've known her since elementary school.    But we very rarely hang out outside of school, which I like because I don't want to spend too much time with her(i get sick of people easily).       I talk to her for at least an hour or 2 every school day, which is plenty for me. But not for her I guess because she has been asking and hinting to me a lot recently. "You need to spend the night!" "You should come over sometime!" and so on.      I kinda change the subject when she brings it up.    I really like her and want to talk to her, just not too often, and just at school.      What should I do? She's very sensitive and might take things personally, thats why I haven't said anything yet.            Thanks for any help!

This happens like 2 a weeek or once on a good week. She wonders why i am ALWAYS on the computer! There is nothing to do around here.Theres only mean,rude boys around here that i hate them.I think i have an addiction to the computer! But right now i don't want no part of her.

20090203092753AAntoHk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So I have been dating this guy for two years?	It's just like it is over      We don't see each other as much and I don't call him or text him often and he doesn't call me or text me often or not nearly as much as we used too.      When we do hang out we usually fight or I am so bored to tears that I can't wait too leave.      And the intimacy has dropped from always to sometimes. It gets so bad that we actually have to ask the other one if they want to have sex that day.      I love him with all my heart and all that I am and I know that he loves me the same. It's just like over.      So since it just kind of over because we lack what we always have and there is little to no effort do I have to break up with him or does he have to break up with me or are we considered broken up because we have grown apart?      We have been together two years. I thought that this was the man that I would marry and he even proposed a year ago so we are engaged.

My girlfriend well now ex i think... idk we went on a break and we were dating for 5 months and we took a break because i was acting differently and she says it was a stupid idea to do it and im the one that asked for it and she said yes when she could of said no but any ways she said she still loves me and i still love her but she says that she has some things to figure out on her own ansd it will take some time to figure that stuff out and a bf on top of it ould be a little much and her friends say she still loves me but they also say that like i said a bf on top of what she has to figure out on her own would be a little much. So is this just a way to let me down easy or does she really have to figure things out cause i know she has alot on her plate right now.

I started a new job, as an actor in adult movies. My co-workers are extremly well-formed, and appealing. However I just cant get over my ex, I really liked her. I get along with my cow-workers really well, and two of them said that they would go to her job(The cashiers office at my college)hanging all over me. I know it will get her extremly heated, I just dont know if it like will help things later, or make them worse. I guess I wanna show her that I am gods gift to women and dont have any problems finding one. That way she knows that when I buy her something on her b-day, that I truely did care about her, and it was all not just superficial, cause if that were the case, I could just get that kind of crap somewhere else. Does any of this make sence?
20090219120701AAJYEfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong to want to give up on romance?	I am the effortless romantic in my relationship, everything I do, I say, etc is romantic...It is just me. My boyfriend however isn't and even though he surprises me once in a while , he has to work at it. So he f'd up our Anniversary and ended up partying in AC with his buddies, then for V-day we did nothing bc I was recovering from strep throat and ended up having a simple dinner, etc. And now this weekend he is off again with his buddies to AC. I just feel as if though we don't do anything but he always finds time to go away with his friends. I am still very much in love but I am seriously thinking I should quit the romance and be a plain Jane. Why go out of my way if I don't get it back right. Then maybe since I have no expectations whenever he does pull out some romance I might be impressed. I am just a little sad and hurt right now maybe.

But when i am away from him I want to snog his face off!!!! i don't understand why i feel so differently at certain times.
20090219113309AAHUTOq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cant decide which guy, please help?	Your Open QuestionShow me another ?    Help, what should i do?   i like one kid, and i like this other, too. the first one knows i like him a lot. the second one doesnt but i think he's gonna ask me out soon. i'd like to go out with him but the first kid will think that i'm just going out with the second kid to get closer to the first kid.      the first kid shows some interest in me. my friends think he likes me, but i'm not so sure. i guess there's a chance.      plus, theyre like, best friends. so to hang out with the second kid, i'll also be hanging out with the first kid a lot. i'm guessing itll be awkward, considering it's already awkward just when our eyes meet.       should i go out with the second kid? or just forget about him and keep liking the first kid, who i've liked a lot for a long time.

I'm putting this in the marriage and divorce section since there are more mature people here.  I'm 25 and have never been in a long term relationship (I'm a female).

My dad is very controlling and intimidating. He always tries to tell me what to do. He tells when to come visit him and always makes me feel obligated to do things or gives me a guilt trip. I don't want to say no bc he will pout and not talk to me for months. He acts like a child. My niece has a party this weekend and I don't want to go bc we have been out of town last weekend and my baby is very fussy. She is teething and ill and needs to be in her environment. I tried to tell my dad this and he says she will be fine here as long as your with her, it doesn't matter if you are at home. Every time I try to tell him no he comes up with a reply or excuse. I am so tired of him controlling my life. We are buying a house soon and I don't even want to move back to my hometown bc then he really will try to control my life. Please help, any advice? Remember he is very controlling and intimidating (6'4, harley rider, can look at you and you want to cry) but can be a good guy.

Ok this started a school year ago she came in the middle of the year witch was the problem.She became good friends with a person i've know most my life and is like a sister(Nicky).Well Nicky came to me later on and told me that when they were in the kitchen she pointed at me and said"who's that he's hot i really like him but I'm scared to say anything".Well that's when the problem came up i was going out with a girl at the time who i liked a lot and i know i did some bad things to get her but I'm a changed person and regret that.Then after 2 or 3 months i realized i was still dating this girl cause i felt sorry for her so i ended it before i hurt her like a couple months went by and i started to really like the new girl but she had a man and after that **** was over i tried to get with her i went with her for a little i was drunk and sent a text saying "my battery is dieing love you good night go to sleep"i check my phone when it charges and she had dumped said i was going to fast and she couldn't do that we stopped talking cause i was pissed she'd do that over that.Now a little less then a year later she got my number from someone and started textin me and i helped her out when her ex was messing with her I've always helped her with her problems she's very emotionally challenged cause her dad's been in and out her life and that ***** her up and she goes for the wrong guys then always comes crying to me.He's the problem i'm starting to like her a lot again i don't know how she feels and the worst part is she's moving soon to most likely another state so her dad can't find her mom.I have no idea what to do so please any advice or opinion will be taken and thanks for reading and your help so its so long but i wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything

I can honestly say in the past 5 years, I have never told him that I love him (he hasn't eaither to me) and I've never hugged him (he hasn't eaither to me)      My dad is kinda strict...   I'm not allowed to talk on the phone, stay after school, join sports teams, etc   He kind of always has to be the boss...and control everyone?   And in our house his word is basically the law.   But he shows my younger brother enoughh love...my brother can basically do whatever he wants without being shouted at or riduicled at by my dad.      I've done many mistakes in my life   And it's taken me along time to forgive myself...   But he hasn't?      I feel like he doesn't love me?   And that he doesn't respect me?      We have random arguments on the smallest of things.   And I cry at least once every 2 days because of him...      I can honestly say that I don't love him anymore.      What can I do to make our relationship better?               ...I can't go to like a psychologist because I used to go when I was depressed...and he wouldn't come.\         Oh yeah. I'm 15.

I know that this should be a no-brainer...but for those of us ditzy redheads, I need an answer. Our first date ended w/fogging up the windows (i hadn't done that since my junior yr in hs, like back in '94). Our 2nd date, which was on Valentine's day, he gave me a card stating "i hope this is the 1st valentines of many...hugs & kisses." Our 3rd date, we hung out at his place all day, channel surfing, then went grocery shopping (i'm one of those types that enjoy, as a couple, grocery shopping - there's a weird close bond, when you're looking at food! ;) and got a pizza and took it back to his place to watch a movie.       I posed the question of whether we should see other people, or if we want to be "stuck" - i know I want to be...but he didn't really give me an answer. I mean, I think he's already got some major feelings for me, by his body language, but I don't know for sure if he wants to see anyone else, or just me.      Are there any major signs to keep a lookout for?

It's not that he doesn't like me, cause he does or else he wouldn't be calling so often and asking to see me all the time.      Weird.

20090219173055AAqKVRQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I love him..but never met him?	okay..i met this kid online..and we are like identical..like exactly the same ..it all started when we met in a chatroom..he was sad because he liked his bestfriend and she rejected him as a friend and more.So for the few past MONTHS we have been talking like every night and we have sooooooooo much in common..like we scare eachother.We would talk and flirt sometimes..even though we both stated how shy we were..because we talked ..and we were both very shy,but a few weeks ago we started flirting and leaving eachother messages to wake up to in the morning and stuff..and like a month ago we started saying "ILY" at the end..before the goodbyes..but a few days ago he said "i love you so much"..and i said i loved him too..because i am pretty sure i do.so we have been saying that lately.BUT today ..that girl that rejected him (we would always trash her)..that mean,rude, self concieted girl decided she would text him today..after ignoring his texts for the past five or six months...so we were talking and he was talking to her online too..he was like ignoring me to talk to her..and he would be like "omg she just said i'm awesome"..and i am jealous i think...i just think ..omg she can't say that..she will hurt him again...so now they are like best friends again..i keep warning him not to trust her so much..but i can't say much because i don't want him to think i'm jealous..or feeling rejected...i mean she was horrible to him..and he is the SWEETEST guy i have ever met in my life. I don't know what to do..i think i love him a lot more than he loves me and i don't know if i can handle that so..maybe time away?..i don't know..if you can help..please do..thanks.      We have talked,he has seen me,i have seen him.He always say "fate brought us together"..and it is scary because it may be true.We are so insanely alike..its creepy..but the coolest thing. When i first met him..i just thought he was a nice guy..just a really cool person..i never thought i would be in a situation of loving him too much. I can't stand to hear about that girl..she makes my stomach turn..i try to be a good friend and tell him that i think it's great that they are friends again..i just can't say too much..because I don't trust her to protect him ..i think she is very capable of breaking his heart again...Now about the distance..we are quite far from each other..but we have talked about visiting and stuff. We want to meet eachother in person,I am jealous..i know i am,of this girl but i can't tell him "omg i love you so much..i just want to be your girlfriend so badly"..it would make things weird...even though it is true.He is 19,i am 17.
20090219123409AAAaZwg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the reason guys act like they don't care and yet...?	my ex(his initial is R) told me he does not love me anymore and he does not want anything to do with me. then he saw my MySpace where my ex (his name is Nick -- like my ex before R) commented about me saying that he knows i am heartbroken right now and he is there for me as a friend..out of the blue he(R) texted me and he was like "So I see you tricked another guy into falling in love with you...supposedly while we were together...or maybe we were not together but either way I see you moved on right after we broke up". I asked him what was he talking about, then he said "I saw your myspace". I told him Nick has been over even before I met and dated him(R). His reply was "Nick still loves you so I can't" I was like what the f*** is the connection about nick loving me but he cant?!?   I love him more than anything else. Why does he act like he is jealous and yet he was the one broke up with me and told me to leave him alone???? One day he told me "if you really want me to be happy then come and find me" but he wont make it easy for me, he said he would change his number and move to another house but he wont tell me where...i am really hurting right now. why do guys do that???

20090219105536AAKSSXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell her my feelings or let it go?	This question is in regards to an older woman(50) and me(22) so, if you're not ok with that, please stop reading here and find another question. Thank you!      Anyways, I told my friend that I've had a crush on her single mother for a long time, and she was really kool with it. She decided to talk to her mom about it because I told her how much of a tricky situation it is and I wasn't sure how to approach it. So, she told me she'd find out what she could, so if all was well, it wouldn't be so bad. Me and my friend are really close and she is 100% ok with my interest in her mom, although she finds it a little strange, she is ok with it.      Anyways, her mother had made comments to me out of nowhere like "You're such a good guy, I'd do ANYTHING for you." "you're such a sweetie, I love you..". She always wants to cook for me, asking me if I have my own place yet, all these good things about my personal life.      Now, her mother and I have had talks about relationships and life in general and we seem to really click. Well, when she talked to her mother, I guess all her mom had to say was "I figured he liked me, It's just too bad..." and she left it at that. I guess my friend tried to get her to elaborate, but she wouldn't, Which is understandable. It'd probably be really awkward to have that conversation with each other, lol. So, she does seem to be attracted towards me.      But, she always goes out with all these a$$-holes and never seems to find a good guy, but I am. I'd treat her like the beautiful soul she really is and I can't keep her out of my head. She has really left a mark on me and she's pretty much everything I want in a woman, mentally and physically. I'm just at a loss. I really want to be with her and I've seen her all scrubby with no make-up and I've seen a lot of her imperfections and I'm still wild about her.      I really want to try and give it a go with her, I just don't know if I should go for it. Even though this isn't the whole picture, what do you think? Is she waiting for me to make the move? Is there anything I can/should do?

20090219123808AADeLVS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Most stereotypical boy problem ever...please help...?	Ok.  We dated for a little over three months.  I was completely crazy about him.  When we got into a fight, after we had just gotten back together after being on a break, I suggested we break up.  He told me I was more serious about the relationship than him, he didn't want me to get too attached because it would be hard for ME when we broke up, etc.  so we ended it.  A few days later, I was missing him.  I asked him if he wanted to get back together.  He said he had fun, but he thought we should just be friends.  Since that time, he has been sending me mixed signals.  He gives me hugs, will grab my hand, flirts with me, and once told me he missed me when he thought I wasn't listening.  It's hard for me to be around him because it hurts too much.  Its been about three weeks since we broke up and I don't know what to do.  Please help.

20090219120300AAVsomt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It seems I have no self control?	It just seems that I have no self control. I haven't always been this way. I cheated on my husband, felt horrible about it, told him 2 years later. We are now divorced, not because of that, other reasons that would take to long to tell. I have been divorced for 6 months now and it seems that no matter what I do, I go out to play pool or to have a couple of drinks and it turns into many drinks and I usually end up kissing other men or going home with them. I have actually only gone home with one but I still end up screwing around. I dont know what my issue is and i dont know how to stop it. I know that this just sounds like I'm a stupid ho but I'm not. I just need some help. i'm scared to death.
20090219121209AAaiQbc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't you tell the woman you've fallen for, these romantic things?	I've fallen for a very special woman. I like her a LOT. I've had so many romantic things to say to her but I know that you can't say things like that to a woman because it'll scare her away. I want to be there for her & support her in the decisions she makes. I want to share every part of my life with her & have her do the same for me. I told her friends how I feel & they get so touched by what I want to tell her, some of them have expressed it made them want to cry, (in a good romantic way.) One of them even expressed interest in me! Too bad she's not the one I fell for. The thing that's got me worried is, you only get one chance at something like this, & I've been searching for a woman like her for 30 years. I don't wanna mess it up. That's how I know I really like her. If I wasn't so worried, I'd just go for it & go with whatever happens. Why can't you just go up to a woman & say the things that come from your heart without coming off as too strong or creepy? 2nd question: How should I approach her?

20090219115857AAi64CB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men need your advice. Am I Heading for More Heartache?	A few weeks ago I found out I'm pregnant. After telling my BF he accused me of doing it on purpose, and broke up with me. Claimed he never loved me and said a lot of very hurtful things. A week later he came back. He apologized and asked for my forgiveness.       My question is am I setting myself up for heartache? He doesn't mention the baby. Never asks me how I'm doing. He refers to the baby as "My Baby" he did look at the ultrasound & listened to the baby's heartbeat but it took some coaxing. He also took me crib shopping but didn't say anything the whole time we were in the store.       Before the pregnancy announcement it was very seldom for him to say "I love you" but since we got back together he hasn't said it at all. he's an actions speak louder than words type of guy. When we got back together I asked him if he loved me he said "A little" He's very much into mind games. He'll say things just to get a reaction out of me.. However, when I spend the night, he holds me all night, gives me kisses as I'm falling asleep, gives me a lot fo attention...       With all that said, does it sound like he's going to stick around? And is he being guarded about his feelings because he doesn't know how he feels about the situation. Should I get out now? I love him and I want to be with him.. What should I do? Does it sound like he's in love with me?

20090219175030AAsM0E6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Has my relationship with my teacher gone too far?	I'm currently studying at a fairly middle-class state school in Surrey, and since joining the sixth form have developed a rather unorthodox relationship with one of the younger teachers. She's in her early 20s, NQT, cute girl though, just my type too. I can't put my finger on exactly how it happened, we just sort of hit it off one day when I was the only one present (we only have about 5 people per class in sixth form), and that's the first time she suggested she give me some extra tutoring (even though my grades at the time were fine). I guess she wanted it as much as I did now I think about it, maybe I made it all a bit too obvious.    Now, it hasn't been sexual from the beginning. The first couple of tutor lessons it was just light flirting interspersed between mathematics- my kind of night- but over the past few months or so it's developed into a sexual relationship, and we've stopped doing any maths at all around her place (though my grades have gotten a lot better, straight As now).    But here's the deal-breaker, I move off to University next year and she has to stay at school to complete her teaching thingy. Trouble is, we're the only two who know about what's really going on, and I don't really want to give it up. None of my friends know, even though they joke about it every now and then :P. The worst thing is if they find out, especially if other teachers and the police find out, her life'll be ruined and it'll be all my fault.    I am 18, but this has been going on since I was 17, and I know I have to break up with her eventually maybe, because I love her enough that I don't want to ruin her life, but I really don't want to, and neither has she. We've only spoken about this briefly, it's not a particularly hot topic, but now I feel like I'm clutching at straws so I'm asking here.   What the **** should I do?   (I'll add more info as required)

20090203092508AAaKePW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If I ever had kids, the only reason I'd have is because my wife(is 27 now) wants one. Will I regret later?	If I ever had kids, the only reason I'd have is because my wife(is 27 now) wants one. I love her and I feel guilty that I'm screwing up her life by not having one. I do understand that this is a 'deal-breaker' and is something that we should have discussed before getting married. We both come from a very conservative culture and breaking up is not an option at all. Will I regret my action later in life coz the reason I had a kid is because my wife wanted one ? I'm torn. I don't want to be the one to shatter my wife's dream at the same time I don't want to take a hit on my time, money and free time. Is there a middle ground ?(probably not..) If we chose not to have one, my wife says she'd be OK with it but I know that she will be so unhappy. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

20090203094155AAxKqE8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i make my relationship work?	ive only been dating my boyfriend for 3 weeks.      the first week before we started dating was amazing, he charmed me, he wanted to see me every minute...and now that we're dating..thats all gone.      he barely wants to hang out, he'd rather party then see me. he's 26 about to be 27, has no job or car and parties almost every other night.      keep in mind that im 18 and i have a car and a job, im way more ahead then he is! and if you are thinking he wants me for sexual reasons, well we havent done anything sexual so that can;t be it      when we first started talking he made it seem like he was really trying to straighten his life out.      did i make him lose this motivation? i talked to him about it, and he said he was gonna try to make it work with us cause he cares about me..but he still isnt trying!      what should i do?
20090203094449AAwva1z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about the boy?	Theres this guy I like, who is also an ex. A long time ago he told me he loved me, but I had a boyfriend at the time and so it didnt go anywhere, but I know it really hurt him. Recently we've became really close again, he really looked after me after i split up with my ex and we've spent alot of time together. Sometimes I thought he was just about to kiss me, and then he would look unsure. He was being flirty all the time though, and everyone said there was still alot of chemistry between us and that he clearly still liked me. So, I worked up the courage and wrote him a letter telling him how I feel. And in reply he said that he cared about me more than anything in the world, but that he didnt want to take the chance of being with me because he felt sure he'd hurt me and if he did and lost me forever in every sense (like as a friend too) itd hurt him too much. He seemed to be really beating himself up about what happened in the past between us and making out he was a bad guy. And then he got quite upset and teary eyed, and then he said he had to think and left. Since then hes said the same thing, but also said he doesnt know whats going on and that it was so out of the blue that its really stunned him. Now I'm trying to keep my distance from him because obviously im hurting quite alot and i dont know whats going on. Anyone care to shed some light?

20090219105742AA867VC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!!!!!! What should I do?!?!?	I've have been best friends with this guy, we'll call him Jon, for a few years now. He's been dating another friend of mine, we'll call her Amber, for a couple of years. They live together and recently got engaged. I was going to help her go shopping for a wedding dress this past Saturday. When I go to their place, she isn't home from work yet. A client came in and she was going to be an hour or so late. Soo... I hung around with Jon for a while. We sat around and talked and goofed off like usual. She came home and we went out shopping. That night I'm sitting at home, like 10:30, had just got out of the shower and put my robe on and someone knocks on my door. Its Jon. I let him in and he's acting all weird and not saying much. He sits on the couch and I get him something to drink and a towel (it was raining and he was soaked). I sat down beside him and ask him what was wrong. He looked at me and said "I love you," which was normal, we said it all the time. I said it back and he hugs me. Then he says, "no, I'm IN love with you." I was speechless. He says he finally realized it after we spent time together that day. We sat there and he held me. He was really upset. He told me he didn't want to marry Amber. I told him he needed to think things through before he jumped to any crazy decisions. Amber was going to visit her parents for the rest of the weekend an hour away and had left after we went shopping. I let him stay the night. In a different room than me! That night I layed in bed thinking about what he said and I realized I was in love with him too. I had never realized it until then. The next morning I get up and make breakfast. We eat and don't mention the night before. He says he has some things to take care of and has to go home. I walk him to the door and he turns around and kisses me. Then walks out. WHAT SHOULD I DO?!?!?!?!?
20090219110157AAzdPpC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I lied to my boyfriend about an email I sent that he felt I was flirting on, now he doesnt want to be with me?	I sent an email to a VP in my company who happens to be my boyfriend's mentor.  In the email, I made a comment about "All work and no play...".  Well, my boyfriend saw the email and asked me was I intentionally flirting with him.  I said no but he 100% feels I was.  I continued to say I wasn't until he convinced me I was.  It took an entire day.  Before him and I agree to commit to one another, we were friends and talked about everything.  Now we are no more because he says he cant trust me because of the email incident and my lying about it.  Since the incident, I have been nothing but true (even before), available and readily accessible but this has not given him any trust for me.  The incident happened 2 weeks ago.  Should I fight for my man (who has said he doesnt want us to have the "man" "woman" title, just to be friends) or should I leave him alone?  How do I recover from a lie and gain his trust back?

20090219110724AAQp1ic	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm going to turn 21 this year but never had boyfriend?	I'm not ugly, many people tell me that I look very cute, but in fact, I have never had boyfriends before...when I think of this, my tears just can't stop from rolling down my face.        Sometimes I hope I was a tree or plant, so I won't be trapped in these meaningless human emotions, but often, I still fell into frustration, after all, deep inside, I'm just a normal girl. A girl who hopes to be loved.         Since high school, I began to masturbate on a regular basis, but after doing it, I feel such a strong feeling of shame. Recently, this kind of behavior becomes more and more frequently.The desire to be comforted and pacified both psychologically and physically can't be satisfied, everybody around said I'm becoming more and more weird and isolated, I began to hate everything around me, even a very small  thing can start the flame of anger in my heart. And I can easily gain hostility against other people. I have become a self that even myself don't recognize, I'm in such great agony right now, I even considered about committing suicide.

20090219111411AAz9sK1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Stay or should I Go?	I have been with my bf for 5 years. At first, things were great. We were both 17 and the first people we had ever really been in a serious relationship with. After a year, he became increasingly argumentative, physically abusive, and controlling. This went on for 4 years (including when I was pregnant with our now 2 year old son). He could not keep a steady job, felt no obligation towards his family, and blamed his actions on me. During those first 4 years, my entire personality changed. I became resentful towards him, cold, and began therapy for anxiety and depression. I am hate myself for who I've become. I left him last year for 2 months, and ever since (for about 7 months) the abuse stopped. However, I feel like I resent him so much for what he put me through, that I can't look at him without remembering it. My trust in his emotional control is gone. I still find myself tip-toeing around so that he does not get angry. He still goes out with his friends every night of every weekend whether I like it or not. Although I am invited to join, I cannot bare sending our son to a sitter every single weekend. He refuses therapy, and when I tell him that I don't think we should be together, he cried and for a while, he become a sweet, passive, caring guy. But, of course, it doesn't last. I'm tired in every sense, and I constantly think of what I am missing by staying with him.       Question: Should I try to give this another shot, or just bare through his tears, empty promises and leave??
20090219111713AA9TJ4V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I'm falling out of love, and I hate it.  What can I do to make things better?	We've been dating for over a year (my longest relationship so far), and lately I'm just really unhappy in the relationship.  It's so strange too, because I love him so much, we actually had planned to get married after college (he'd propose after graduation, we'd have a year-long engagement and get married in the spring).  Now, I'm not so crazy about the idea.  I'm not sure if its my fault or his fault, but lately I've been so annoyed about little things, like his refusal to get out of his pjs, or his cutting class, or his excessive drinking.  For instance, at a concert on a friday night (valentine's friday) it was just me and him and he told me he was upset that he was missing the parties.  Is this just me being crazy critical or is there a legitimate problem?        Sorry this is so long and rambly.  I'm just seriously concerned.  I don't want our relationship to be thrown away over nothing, and I don't want to confront him yet (he has depression, and is also really sensitive about feelings-related things.  I don't want to hurt him).  If anyone has ANY advice whatsoever, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks!

20090219113236AAVvQ7W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I still like this girl and I don't know what to do.?	Ok, here's the situation. I live in an duplex type of apartment with 3 of my roommates. Our neighbors are engaged and they use to hang out with us a lot at the beginning of the school year. Well the guy she's with is a abusive and does cocaine. They basically broke up but continued to live together due to a lease.       Well, over time, she would come over and watch movies with us or just hang out. Eventually she began to like me a little more. One night she came over while her ex went home for the weekend. Well we ended up watching a movie together and both fell asleep on the couch together (nothing happened that night). Well, the next night we basically did the same and she asked me to lay with her. Well, in the middle of the night, I asked if she wanted to go sleep upstairs since the couch was kinda uncomfortable. We ended up hooking up that night.      Well from there on, she basically started staying with me. Her and her ex started to argue to the point she told him that she was going to stay over here until he learned to control himself. I have a female roommate so according to him, she stayed with my female roommate. Well for almost a month she stayed with me and it was great...i love having her around but her ex kept bothering us by knocking in the middle of the night and if she answered he would yell and threaten her. She eventually got a restraining order.       This is where it starts to turn around. We both enjoyed being together without being officially together. But after a little while she started having second thoughts and beginning to think about what has happened. We talked and she insured me that I wasn't just a rebound or a fling but that she has to figure **** out. Now we don't really see each other as often and it kills me since she's my neighbor. She still wants to talk to me and be friends but its hard for me because of what had happen the past month. Now I'm pretty sure she still talking/seeing her ex but not telling me. There is really no reason to tell me since we're not together but why lie to me. I don't know what to think because it's hard for me to let her go since we were so close for that month and the fact she's going to be my neighbor for the next 5 months. I want to be with her but she doesn't know what exactly she wants. I just need some help.

20090219115857AAsGxO7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me (or should I just give up)?	I have a guy friend that I've had a crush on for some time. The problem is, I'm really shy around him, and he's kind of an introvert (though I wouldn't say he's shy; he's actually a very friendly person). I can't figure out if he's a) kind of awkward around me, or b) just not interested. He treats me different than most other girls, he remembers random things I say (more than my other male friends do), but he's more reserved around me than other females. He makes fun of girls he knows a lot (it's often the way interacts with them), but he doesn't really make fun of me. Also, he's more time with me than he has with other girls.    However, when we're in group settings, he doesn't pay a whole of attention to me. Sometimes, he'll make eye contact and smile. But, both of us usually end up talking to the other people present. Also, when I run into him at school, he doesn't stop and talk to me for very long- he usually just waves or says hi, or we have a very short conversation. But, I know he is very busy, so he's usually going to work or class. Also, he usually doesn't sit with me at meals. One time I saw him come in the cafeteria and I know he saw me, but he still sat with other people.   So, is he just not interested? Or is there potential?

I realized how stupid i was being and how I acted selfish and I didnt value her and try hard to have a good relationship. I get confident that I dont need her and then when i push her away i realize what a big mistake I have made. Now I'm a broken man that feels regret that she no longer wants to be with me because I've pushed her away.       I even do this to my family. Help me stop or I wont ever have a relationship with anyone.

He doesn't live in the same city as me so took a train ride (20 mins) to come and see me. We had coffee and talked and it was really nice and he really seemed to enjoy it. The date lasted about 3 hours just chatting over a cup of coffee and something to eat. Very relaxed. We talked bout all sorts of things. He asked about a girl who he used to like who is my flatmate and then before he left asked me whether I would want to go camping with him and some friends in June. I haven't heard from him. He said he had a really good time and we should meet up again. How long should I wait for him to call? And will he call? Help...I'm going crazy.

She disappeared and all of a sudden i got a text saying how she had lots of craziness going on in her life and blah blah. She said she misses me and the way I make her happy. I was upset that I didn't even get a hello last three weeks. She asked me if I was mad. I sent a message that I regret and i want to know if it is over. I said I wasn't mad but that when she dissappears like this I actually think something happened to her or that she just doesn't give a s*** . I said this in anger because I had no idea what she wanted me to say? I mean someone you have fun with and hook up with just disappears, reappears and what did she expect? I think I screwed up but I also feel like she doesn't give a damn and is playing games. I had to put my foot down so I don't sound weak or a wuss. I thought, if i don't say anything now, she may do it again and again. Honest opinions please. Is it over, will i hear from her again? I was offended that if she misses me and her not talking to me had nothing to do with me(so she says) so why take it out on me? A simple hello would have been cool. I don't know, what you think..

20090219173643AAMmXfO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls I try to date get sucked into a black hole?	I'm 24 years old, tall, have a good professional job, nice, friendly, and have been told I'm funny...but Ive never had a girlfriend. I am in ok shape, not great, but I work out occasionally.       Every time I try to date someone who I think is interested in me, or someone has told me is interested, they end up falling off the face of the earth, and I never hear from them again.      I'm not needy and do not act desperate (although being almost 25 and never experienced having a girlfriend anyone would be). I try to keep some distance. Just seems like things are going well and then they cease all contact with me. Is this just normal female behavior or something terribly wrong with me?
20090219175023AA872iO	Family & Relationships;Family	Signs are showing, but what do they mean?	Hey everyone. I'm feeling really down tonight because my mum has snapped at me again. I promise you I'm not hear to complain about what she said. That really doesn't matter. What has upset me is that my mum and I have always been close. I love her so much and can't imagine her not being around. Obviously this is something I will eventually have to come to terms with, but I am not prepared to think about it just yet.       Anyway, the point is over the last few years my mum has been subtly changing. She can be quite unkind (to loved ones and strangers) for no apparent reason, she is very forgetful (this has been much worse in the last few moths), she's impatient, her cooking use to be amazing, but recently I've been avoiding eating when I visit because it really isn't very nice anymore (I don't know if that means anything). Basically in short she has changed. None of the above mentioned are like her at all. I've been pretending it's not happening until recently. I know people change as they get older, but I am really starting to wonder if there is more to it than that. I mean, she's only 54. She really isn't that old, but of course we are all different.         I don't really know what I'm expecting in response to this. I don't know if I want advice or if I'm just hoping for some comforting words. Anyway, perhaps you can decide for me. Thanks for listening.

20090219180616AAff3wh	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this illegal of my mother?	So here's my situation,  I am a freshman in high school, and since the start of middle school, i was doing terrible in school because a lot of things, the main reason was my grandma was horribly sick, and it was taking a tole on my whole family.  I lived with my grandma and grandpa for much of my life, but i couldn't do well in school because i had so many other things to worry about, and so did everyone else.  So i failed all of middle school, and even dropped out for the last half of 8th grade      In this recent summer my grandma passed away, and i started school living with my mom.  That did not go well at all, there were so many problems between us 2, there was no communication, so much arguments, secrets, hard feelings between us.  My mom just gave up on me altogether eventually, and i stopped going to school.  I was so depressed as it is, and with my mom constantly putting me down, and my dad telling me all i was doing was "living off of my mom" did not help at all.      Recently, i almost literally saw the light.  My grandpa, who through all of this i didn't see much of, asked if i wanted to live with him.  By this time my grandpa was doing very well, and decided to pull himself out of his depression after losing his wife of nearly 40 years.  Both my grandma and grandpa were in their mid 50's so that's even a longer time.  So at the start of the second semester of school, i went to live with him, my mom did not put up a fight when i left, but she had nothing good to say about me living there.        Ever since i've been living with my grandpa and his now fiancee, i have gotten back in school, im getting all A's and B's in my classes, and i just feel better about myself.  I'm back on track, and since i been living with my grandpa my mom has not given any financial support, she still recieves my child support, and claims me on her taxes, and hasn't given a dime to my grandpa.  I'd like to do something about it, but my grandpa won't ask her, and my mom won't talk to my grandpa because of their own problems.        Is this illegal of her and is there anything i, or my dad(who is concerned about this issue also) can do about this?  My dad wants the money he pays for child support to go directly to either me or my grandpa.  I'd rather have it go directly to my grandpa.  Someone please help i don't know much about this stuff, i'm only 15 and want deeply for my grandpa to get more money to help him raise me for the next 3 years.

20090219175858AAUXoHe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I dissapointing my husband when it comes to sex?	This is more than likely all in my head.. My husband is an amazing man. He works so hard, so I can be a stay at home mom. He works independantly and sometimes work unitl dark. He comes in and he is tired, and he still has it in him to help out with the kids.    Last night we had sex and he was just not into like usual.. I mean I got on top and beleive me after a stressful day I was enjoying his penis lol. He did not seem to be into it. After we were finished he just rolled over and went to sleep. He never does this. I love him and want him to get as much out of it as I does.    I worry too much and I know it.. that just kind of bothered me. He told me he was just tired. This is not a normal thing. Am I just worrying too much?   Maybe I will give it another go tonight, I could go for some sex tonight as well... maybe he wont be so tired

20090219180050AAZn9qr	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Did my friend get engaged to early?	My best friend was with her boyfriend for 6 months before they became engaged, now they fight all the time they have been living together for about 5 months now ever since she got kicked out, one reason they fight is because she has him wrapped around her little finger and she doesn't work.       I tried getting her to come to  TAFE with me and she refused because she wants to get married next year yet they don't save.       She was also rubbing it in that i don't have a ring on my finger and she does, she doesn't understand that im trying to stop her from getting hurt.       What does everyone think?       Is there anything i can do?
