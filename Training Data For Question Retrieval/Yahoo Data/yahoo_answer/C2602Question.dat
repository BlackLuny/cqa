For me and my friends it was us making a golf cart go 60 mph with a 3 speed transmission and putting a 200hp Evinrude boat motor in a Pinto lol.  Which was kinda hard to do since it was water cooled. so we could only go short distances using a tank of water along with the fuel tank but we got it to go 45 lol.  Not recommended as a way to travel, but it was a fun project anyway.

20090227143915AAkT74V	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR problem about a CAR accident?	so, there was this mardi gras parade with alot of floats, and as i was going home from work, i stopped at a stop light, and btw, i was the 3rd or 4th car to be at the stop light. and then there was this big truck and behind the truck, it pulled a big mardi gras trailer/float. and the trailer/float struck or hit into my left light signal. and the police went and did the report. but i noticed that the weird thing was, the officer never took any photos of the accident..       then few days later, i got the report. it says that "the guy that hit me made a right turn while it was clear and then he noticed that i was coming towards him NOT SLOWING DOWN. and witness stated that i was already making the turn when he hit me..."      major problem is that the witness was part of the family or related somehow, but she was in another car behind the trailer. and they lied. and also the police believed them and not us, there was no camera at the place where we got hit,  and no other evidence. it was by a chevron gas station... the guy was white, and im asian. i was thinking, maybe the police sided with the guy who hit me, 1. cause they might be friend or so.. or 2. cause of race ethnicity.. the damage that they cause to my car is about 2100,,      so any advices on what i should do?

When I start the car and let it warm up it does like most cars do which is the temp gauge goes in the middle somewhere and remains at that point.  When I turn the air on I get heat, but when I leave to drive about 5 minutes of driving the temp guage goes back down to the "cold" location.  Then I get no heat.  Again when I just let the car sit and idle it goes back to the middle and I have heat.   I checked the radiator while it was running and Iam seeing the flow of ant-freeze so the water pump is working.  I also kept the cap off  for 30 minutes thinking there might be air pockets in it but that didnt work.  One person told me he thinks there might not be any thermostat in this car because how it goes back down so fast after driving.  Any ideas      Thanks

I went to Autozone and they got a PO153 from the diagnostics handheld.       I have just recently began using Shell V-Power Premium gasoline regularly (Filled up about 4 times on it now) It says it cleans the engine, though I know there is no real difference could this be it?      So how serious is this problem, how much could ti be to be fixed if it is the most major thing which would be maybe an Engine misfire condition I read on PO153 that it COULD be that. But if it was an Engine Misfire Condition wouldnt other codes be coming up as well?       If it was really serious other codes would be popping up too, right?

20080708181940AA0ZdUL	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Good teen car?	I am 15, i will be 16 in about ten months and i really want a car.  I know you are probably thinking what can a 15 year old do with a car?  Well i live in south dakota so i got a learners permit when i turned 14.  Also you only have to have that for 6 months (3 months cuz i took drivers ed) and i got a restricted license which alsos me to drive by myself.  My mom has just recently let me drive by myself to school and to a friends house because i am her only child and she wants me to be safe.      I need a car because we have a roush mustang so driving it is pretty limited cuz it has so much power and its like my dads little baby.  Then we have an excursion.  Have you seen one?  I think i need a truckers licence to drive it.      Okay so i need a car with good milege, not bad on insurance, four wheel drive for winter and safe.      How do i convince my parents/grandparents to get me one.  Its not about money but that i am ready.  They have a company so i would work in the store for money.
