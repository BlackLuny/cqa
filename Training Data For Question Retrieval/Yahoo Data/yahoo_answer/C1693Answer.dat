It was so funny and by the time they got them all under control, the guy who did it refused to leave. They came in dancing too. I laughed soo hard becasue it like ruined her party for her, and her parents found drugs under the coffee table when they got home that night so she was grounded.

WnV4ZTUYaa	I couldn't agree more.  It is totally obscene that this amount of money is being spent on a couple of weeks of people running, jumping and throwing things.  Almost every week we hear that the cost is going up - it will probably be in the region of 20 billion by 2012.

20LnuCejaa	It's greed.  After the depression, financial regulations were instituted to prevent a collapse of banks in the future.  Then... I believe during the 80s, the government deregulated banking and financial institutions.  That's when the trouble started and built up to what we have now.  All those responsible should be held accountable, but you don't hear anything about that.
QBH92zsEaa	If by "World Music" you mean a kind of eclectic blend of non-Western and native instrumentation and rhythms - - there will be a "New Age" category at www.grammy.org /  The annual Music Award show is on Sunday evening on CBS Network.  .  .perhaps some "World Music" performers will be slated.

JhC6BvPpaa	I find this Q rather amusing. MUMMY? We didn't need the Yanks during the Falklands war, our last major naval engagement against a rather well equipped and well trained navy. We have just commissioned a new frigate that can take on 100 targets in any direction at any moment in time and there's 5 more of those are on the way. I don't even think Israel owns one frigate. Even our MUMMY - the USA doesn't own such frigates. So even though it aint going to happen, the RN can look after itself very well, thanks.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	The last was between Israel and arabs happened in 1982,and the arabs were armed to their teeth with the most modern Soviet arms.Dont try to tell me that the Soviet arms are worth nothing,because if it were so,then the Europeans and Americans would  be a bunch of cowards who were afraid of the USSR armed with something "worth of nothing".  The Russian tanks even today are considered to be among the best in the world,and some 25-30 years ago they were absolute leaders.  The same refers to the light arms and artillery systems.  In the air,American jets have certain advantage over Russian MiGs,but this advantage is not too serious.  So,the fact that Israel,much worse armed and with much less army,managed to beat arabs up as many tmes as they attacked her,testifies that the Israeli Army is not bad.  Your question has no sense,because in order to reach the Israeli shores,the Royal navy would have to pass through Suez,which Egypt will not permit never,remembering what happened in 1953.But even if the Royal navy reaches Israeli shores,it will become the easy target for Israeli  aviation,because israel would havde the absolute advantage in the air .   And at last,lets be honest;judging by what happened in the Royal navys conflict with Iran,when some Iranina patrol  boats calmly captured the British marines who "bravely" surrendered without a single shot and the commander of the British fregate who sent them on the mission did not move a finger to liberate his men,it seems to me that the Royal Navy today is not in an adequate state for a serious fight.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	Urrr the Royal Navy.... The British have the most nuclear submarines!|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Israel would beat your ***.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Royal navy will win hands down.|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	The Israeli Defence Forces - Army, Navy and Air Force, if they put their minds to it, could conquer the Mediterranean littoral and that of the Red Sea from Khartoum to the Turkish/Syrian border and from Gaza to Cyrenaica in a week.    As regards the naval side of things, the Royal Navy (British) would have a bit of a fight inasmuch that naval warfare these days, indeed, from the time of Pearl Harbour, is dependent upon submarine and aviation assets. In imposing a blockade upon Israeli ports, any blockading force would be subject to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) attacks. Naval air defences among the advanced Naval countries -  (UK, France) are dependent upon anti-aircraft missiles - even the aircraft that could be deployed from the new French carrier could not prevail against the IDF/AF, bearing in mind that the IDF has force multipliers such as air to air refuellers for their fighter-bombers and AEW assets (Airborne Early Warning) such as Phalcon in converted 707 aircraft.    Geopolitical factors must also be taken into consideration. Israel and Turkey are very close in terms of diplomatic relations and interchanges in defence technology. Futhermore, Israel is and advanced country in terms of indigenous military technology and can and will produce her own weaponry - very much as South Africa did during the apartheid years. South Africa is now a world leader in advanced military technology.    The USA (hardly Britain's mummy, except for being stone dead in terms of infantry tactics - as proven in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in domestic Counter-Insurgency (COIN) - Northern Ireland) would be hard put to assist the UK in a coastal blockade, and, in any case, neither country is going to risk alienating Turkey, who is a king-pin in NATO in this particular region.|`|I3CNklLKaa	The Royal Navy is now just a rowing boat called The HMS Saucy Sue.|`|ko6iH39Iaa	no body would win ,every one loses in war,,,|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Royal Navy.

Maybe because they have too much stock sent to them by the Americans that they dont have any space in silos.    I hate israel.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Royal Navy would win easily.   First it is larger.

Funding them, planning the attacks, training them, etc.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	The fact that one of them is state sponsored. Meaning the government directly engaging in the terrorist activities is also funding it.|`|jijwLJWdaa	State sponsored terrorism is when a state is deliberately involved in terrorism.    One example is US state sponsored terrorism against Nicaragua in the 1980s. There the World Court condemned the United States for international terrorism.    When it is not state sponsored, like with Al Qaeda, it is just terrorism.

BKrVqOgiaa	Hi Amber,  Yes, piracy is a romantic notion, isn't it!  Actually, I read of the reason for some Somali citizens turning to piracy in a magazine, during a long wait at the doctor's office.   It seems as though those who once worked as fishermen are now unable to do so, since their coastal waters have become so polluted that there are no longer any fish (strangely, no one seems to know the how and why of this situation.)    I have to admit that it gave me a distinct feeling of sympathy for those who were forced (yes, forced)  to turn to piracy in order to survive.  It's to be noted that none of these pirates have injured nor killed anyone.  After that big money drop to pirates that I witnessed on tonight's news, I'd like to comment that I think I'm in the wrong line of work ;)

LOL|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	The term brainwashing was first used to describe U.S. prisoners of war returning from Korea where they had been held in Chinese POW camps.    These soldiers where deprived of food shelter and medicine in an attempt to indoctrinate them into supporting the communists in Korea.    Brainwashing is a very blunt tool, anyone undergoing it would be under no illusion what was happening to them.    However the doctors who identified Brainwashing, then identified much more subtle and less violent methods at work in general society which they first called 'mind control' but after the tin foil hat brigade stole that phrase it is now known as 'thought reform'.    Once you look at the processes and learn how to identify them, you see them at work all around you, especially by the most popular members of groups.    The biggest mistake to make is to believe that Brainwashing or thought reform can only be used on the 'weak minded'. If there is any common denominator, its the 'open minded' who are more open to influence to ideas which they first resisted, and which most people not under the influence of thought reform would dismiss as nonsense.    Thought reform is real, look at Jonestown, Waco, and all the other cults. They are extreme examples, but other groups use thought reform in equally sophisticated ways, not neccecerily for mass suicide, but to influence peoples actions, and to convince them they are doing it of their own free will without outside influence.|`|qBGcU465aa	no ,   I am in Control of my own thinking|`|AA10236979	I can't think of any beliefs that have changed significantly in the past few years.

Seems as if Casey missed the 'single life' and wanted to go back to that lifestyle of partying and hanging with friends.  Unfortunately, in Casey's mind, Caylee got in her way, that is so sad. As far as any reports of abuse, no.  Casey didn't get along too well with her mother, but they all lived together and the grandparents truly loved  the baby.|`|145RUNQHaa	I am from the uk and over here we all struggle to make sense of the baby p tragedy.i have only just heard about caylee and reading about it turned my stomach.you cannot hope to make sense out of something like that it is the sort of thing that makes me shudder when i realise what sort of world we live in.when i first read about baby p my heart broke and i have not been the same since.i have a toddler son and watching him and how sweet he is makes me scream inside that anyone could hurt such a defenseless child.there is not a day that goes by that i don't think about what that baby went through but the most heart wrenching fact of all is that children are being abused and hurt and killed even as i write this.sometimes i feel that i can not cope with carrying that knowledge around inside me but you have to try to stop analysing too much just realise evil exsists and we are often powerless to stop it.pray for caylee.i have not always been a religious person but i find praying helps and imagining the little ones dealt a raw deal on this earth are in a far better place now safe and free of fear.|`|uu6JYenAaa	Only  a mentally ill person would say and do the things she has said and done.

CognlRigaa	according to what I read, a whole bunch of money, Millions in one shot, are going to some absurd things. but I also read that this would put a "credit" in our pockets $500 if single, $1000 if married, if you make over $75k, the amount lessens. to be dispersed sometime late this year 2009/2010.

Each of these 'economic stimulation' packages rise inflation.  Every extra dollar printed my the PRIVATE Federal Reserve Bank rises inflation, which basically means each and everyone one of our dollars are worth less and less.  The corrupt GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE BANKERS, and CORPORATE ELITE, are stealing money from us every SINGLE day.  There is no economic problem other than the ultra rich holding all the money.  Take a look at the statistics.  The top 1% of Americans own over 40% OF THE WEALTH!! The bottom 80% own a little over 8%!|`|25e780503bbee88521ba2f6e3529d316aa	It will be going in.

kXCgQoYLaa	I guess there's two sides to this debate. When I first heard, my reaction was similar to when Jonathan Ross was suspended; 'Oh, good, another crass, opinionated smart **** has got their come-uppance- that'll teach her to keep it buttoned!, but  THEN I find out that it was said in a PRIVATE conversation and that someone with a ' politically- correct ' conscience grassed her up! t This aspect of modern life is making me feel distinctly uneasy; where will it end?!   We know she used a word which has definitely become taboo, and she, as a journalist should understand the power of words, but  I can't help feeling a bit sympathethic if it was taken out of context. And I don't even like the woman; she displays the most unpleasant qualities of both her parents- egomaniac like Mum, tactless and snobbish like Dad!|`|hKP5sQewaa	Hey Eich  I don't think shes racist, nor did she mean to say a racist thing, i think she just said a silly thing. My Grandad isn't racist, but back when he was a kid (round about WW2) he named his dog that was the collar black what would now be considered racist, i think its just as the times have went on, Political correctness has gotten a lot bigger then it used to be. Like i said, hes not racist, that was just another word they used for the coular black in them days, meant in a non racist way. But nowadays it would be considered racist.    As for a insight to what shes like, well she was on a reality TV show where a bunch of celebraties are thrown in a Australian forist and have to live there and do chanlenges and then get voted of. From the little i seen, she seemed very loud and had a weird accent and i felt slightly embarrised for her because shes in a bit of a world of her own it seemed.    I think thatchers daughter just made the mistake of not being PC, probably because that is what many people when she was growing up referred to black people as what she did. So she probably doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. But i could be wrong.  Anyway, now that we grow up in a PC world there shouldn't be anymore racial slurs accidentally said. I don't like it when people say racist slurs, even when its not my race being offended, because there usually said by horrible people.    Good night. :]|`|Y46YE1e2aa	if your statement is correct and she has been dropped then she will be leaving at the same time as Johnathon Ross wouldn't you think so? but I haven't heard that he has been dropped and if not, why not? his action was far more offencive than a Reference to a Doll . =for goodness sake= what is this country of ours coming to.

AA11711150	I too am surprised and pleasantly so at the election coverage.  I remember the election of 1992, when Clinton handily defeated the first Bush.  Dan Rather was so overjoyed he barely contained himself and it was way too obvious which candidate he voted for. I switched over to the ABC newscast and all the anchors there looked like they were about to cry.  I wouldn't doubt it if Hannity was crying along with the rest of that obviously pro-Bush bunch at Fox.   These major news channels have been sharply criticized and rightly so for recent coverage of elections and calling them before all polls in all time zones have closed.  Maybe this time they have learned some lessons.|`|a072cb238f3a22e69129467aeb4d51adaa	From what I heard today, Hannity is still crying.

Saber que en este mundo todos los hijos somos hijos del amor, si no no hubieramos nacido. Buscar apoyo, y tambien darnos cuenta de que somos necesarios para otros, y todo esta por venir.    Si es un ser querido el que consume, no hostigarlo. Mirar en nosotros mismos como familiares o amigos que hacemos con nuestra ansiedad o angustia, no volcarla sobre l, que ya tiene bastante con su propio caos . Ser humildes porque l es un emergente de lo que lo rodea y esta padeciendo las consecuencias, y nosostros no somos mejores que l, muchas veces al contrario. Agradecer cada cosa positiva que sucede: por ejemplo: lleg en mal estado, pero vino : esta  a salvo de peligros mayores.

Primero t cuento q estuve internado 3 a?os en una C.T. (comunidad terapetica) debido a mi consumo c/drogas (cocaina, farmacos y debes en cuando marihuana). Desde el a?o 1998 (octubre 21) q no consumo + nada y desde ese momento hasta hoy lamentablemente va creciendo el nro. d casos; lo q es peor es q cada vez son + chicos d edad y consumen + porkerias (Paco o Base, Analgesicos para animales, solventes o pegamentos, etc.). Tambien hay q tomar en cuenta el crecimiento d la pobreza y x supuesto no hay q olvidar la falta d informacion q hay x parte d las autoridades del gob. y de las escuelas/colegios.  X otro lado existe el problema (tal vez el mayor) d q la droga mueve miles d millones y x eso no les conviene a muchos q se legalice y lucran c/eso.  Creo q las campa?as q hacen aca (Argentina) no sirven para nada. Porq t dicen x ej: " Decile no a las drogas" y no t explican el xq o como hacer.  Hace mucho dieron una campa?a (la mejor hasta ahora) d unos dibujos y t explicaban lo q t hacia cada cosa (SIN MOSTRAR).  Tambien t digo (con esto termino) q los noticieros son cualkier cosa cuando tocan esos temas xq no t informan bien y t muestran x ej: como se arma 1 paco, a cuanto est y donde se consigue (CUALKIERAAA!!!!)...xq no se lo dan a los pibes directamente.

Yo e visto y veo casos muy de cerca y el consumo (en la mayoria de los casos) pasa por una eleccion de la persona que cree que lo "saca", por supuesto momentaneamente, de una situacion dolorosa. Es una manera de no afrontar el dolor, o resolver los problemas encontrando una satisfaccion, por eso les cuesta tanto salir.  En mi experiencia personal actue de esta manera:   - Primero hay que ser pacientes con la persona que se droga e ir hablandole de lo malo que es para l y como empeorara en el transcurso de los a?os,  porque la droga destruye neuronas.  - Que esten en contacto con personas que estan en reabilitacion para que vean a que punto llegan y como quedan, porque hay algunos que no dicen una palabra coherente.  - Lo mas dificil es que la persona que se driga tiene que estar dispuesta a aceptar ayuda, sino nada sirve y para eso es que hay que hacer todo lo que se nos ocurra pacientemente.  - Una vez que acepto la ayuda lo principal es acompa?arlo y no solo ayuda para dejar la droga sino un tratamiento psicologico para ayudarlo a enfrentar la vida porque la droga es una manera de aislarse cada vez mas.  Como solucion universal creo que hay cosas para hacer y muchas, pero algunas resultan imposibles, por eso creo que lo mejor es prevenir hablando mucho con las personas que queremos y ayudando a quienes no pudieron escapar.|`|Gf15y8uyaa	eso es algo que no se convate.... por que viene desde hace varias generaciones y cada ves es mas.... habria que legalizarla, y todos los faloperos que van al hospital por sobredosis no tendrian q atenderlos, habria q dejar q se mueran por faloperos....  y listo! seria el mejor remedio.....   y luego las familias que se vallana a llorar a la iglesia!!|`|90569acc1bdd33843b4c17c88b2a6c92aa	educando a los chicos.|`|a96cea10cbeb8ae7d049c1f436c1f560aa	Se?ores el problema no es salir de las drogas.

"altera nuestra conducta". deberiamos clasificar las drogas, por niveles) en un lugar habilitado para tal caso, y quien expenda debe ser algun facultativo (medico), quien podra ver al consumidor, en las condiciones en que se encuentra, podria brindarle ayuda, en caso de querer rehabilitarse o de necesitarlo.    quien use drogas inyectables tendria a mano material esteril y descartable.    que sea la droga legal no significa que se pueda hacer cualquier cosa bajo los efectos de la droga. como conducir un vehiculo, o cualquier actividad en que intervenga un tercero.    constitucion nacional argentina    (Artculo 19- Las acciones privadas de los hombres que de ningn modo ofendan al orden y a la moral pblica, ni perjudiquen a un tercero, estn slo reservadas a Dios, y exentas de la autoridad de los magistrados.

Everyone is losing their homes, cars and lives.  I'm sorry that you're family is going through what they are, but they are not the first, and they certainly won't be the last.

Good luck. We all need it.|`|AA10742996	A depression is a severe economic downturn that lasts several years. Fortunately, the U.S. economy has not experienced a depression since The Great Depression of 1929, which lasted ten years. The GDP growth rates were of a magnitude not seen since:     1930 -8.6%  1931 -6.4%  1932 -13%  1933 -1.3%.    During the Depression, unemployment was 25% and wages (for those who still had jobs) fell 42%. Total U.S. economic output fell from $103 to $55 billion and world trade plummeted 65% as measured in dollars.    The Depression was aggravated by poor monetary policy. Instead of pumping money into the economy, and increasing the money supply, the Fed allowed the money supply to fall 30%. The "New Deal" created many government programs to end the Depression, but government programs alone could not end it. Unemployment remained in the double-digits until 1941, when the U.S. entry into World War II created defense-related jobs.    We probably won't see a depression like that again, simply because the government has learned how to avoid it. Many laws and government agencies were put in place because of The Great Depression with the express purpose of preventing that type of cataclysmic economic pain.    ...or has the governmnet learned anything?????|`|Kkxl8jchaa	like they are saying on the news and in the papers, it's going to get allot worse before getting any better.

Once I can go to places in the Mid East, Hong Kong, India and Africa and NOT hear similar pejorative terms about white people, such as "gweilo" in Hong Kong (just to mention one), then I will take all this anti-Golliwog thing a bit more seriously. It seems to me that only whites have to feel guilty about racism and only whites are normally labelled as racist. You will find that it is normally only whites who go out of their way not to be racist in actions or words.    I reject the idea that racisn is caused of mostly done by whites, having travelled to more than 130 countries and I spend my time actually amongst the people. Most of the world is racist....I don't let it bother me because I treat others as individuals.  This is why I can called something in India, or elsewhere, and I really don't care much:  I know that your average white person is consciously LESS racist than pretty much any other ethnic group and I refuse to socially engineer my language (not that I use the term Golliwog anyway) to suit guilt ridden leftie PC nutters.

Here is the story: Just remember that this guy reported Madoff in 2000, but nothing was done.    The whistleblower who waged a decade-long campaign to alert federal regulators to problems plaguing embattled money manager Bernard Madoff said today that the SEC "roars like a lion and bites like a flea" when it comes to combating wrongdoing.    Harry Markopolos blasted the Securities and Exchange Commission in his first appearance before Congress, saying the agency failed to act despite receiving credible allegations of fraud about Madoff's operations for nearly a decade.    "There was an abject failure by the regulatory agencies we entrust as our watchdog," he said.    Madoff, a prominent money manager, was arrested in December after confessing to his sons that he had lost a whopping $50 billion of investors' money in a Ponzi scheme, according to federal authorities.    Markopolos, a securities industry executive and fraud investigator, brought his allegations to the SEC about Madoff starting in 2000.    "The SEC is ... captive to the industry it regulates and is afraid" to bring big cases against prominent individuals, he said.    Despite detailed evidence he submitted to the SEC between 2000 and 2008, Markopolos said, the regulators did nothing. Because of their inaction, he said, "I became fearful for the safety of my family."    Madoff, who was once chairman of Nasdaq and sat on SEC advisory committees, was "one of the most powerful men on Wall Street and in a position to easily end our careers or worse," Markopolos said.    In December, Christopher Cox, then-SEC chairman, pinned the blame on the agency's career staff for the failure over a decade to detect what Madoff was doing.    He ordered the SEC's inspector general, H. David Kotz, to determine what went wrong. Kotz has expanded his inquiry to examine the operations of the divisions led by Thomsen, who has been the enforcement chief since mid-2005, and Richards, who has held that position since 1995.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	I think what you're suggesting is extremely far fetched.

i7oHTo9haa	Israel has peace treaty with Jordan and Egypt and has no reason to go into Lebanon except under hostilities from Hezbollah.  It is misinformation that Israel is not legal owner of Israel land and that Arabs calling themselves Palestinians have ownership.  There never was such a country called Palestine to be taken away to begin with  The land was originally Judah, our largest Israeli tribe.  When the modern nation of Israel was formed it is every sovereign nations right to welcome anyone they wish to let in their borders and it is not internationalists place to decide otherwise.  Britain already explained this to the League of Nations prior to the vote when they had ownership of the region.    The statehood on countries that waged war on fledgling Israel ( 14 May 1948) is as follows:    Jordan 25 May 1946, , Syria 17 April 1946, Lebanon 22 November 1943, Egypt 18 February 1922, Iraq 3 October 1932, North Yemen 1918, South Yemen 1968    It is propaganda to claim we aren't indigenous to the region but they know better.  Jewish people have always maintained settlements in Israel: We had a claim of Messiahship out of Gaza, Kabbalah hub in Safed, spiritual center in Jerusalem with settlements here and there all over throughout history. The name Westerners call the "West Bank" is Judea (Judah tribe, we are Jews) and even when the majority of our people were in diaspora, we prayed to the East, to Jerusalem.     Our national anthem is HaTikvah, and the poem Tikvatenu.  Read that poem and listen to that song and maybe you'll see how much Israel has always meant to us. It only takes one daughter of Israel to cry for Israel and the hope will never be lost, til the end of time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1I6d0OTS...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatikvah Te...    There is no such thing as a Palestinian people that they are simply Syrian orphans created when the Arabs lost their war with fledgling Israel, then abandoned on Israel's doorstep.  Syria founded the PLO to overthrow both Israel, Lebanon and Jordan. Syria wants to re-make their Greater Syrian Empire, similar to what Saddam wanted to do with Kuwait and Mesopotamia. PLO was kicked out of both Jordan and Lebanon  They all got their modern countries and just wanted more and leave Israel out in the cold. All the Arabs gave up except Syria and Iran is allied with Syria. They are just hegemonistic Islamic fanatics. Arabs already admitted there is no such thing as Palestinian people.       "The Israelis can sue the Arabs now, and demand billions or even trillions in compensation for the damage caused them in 1948-1967. You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967. So the Israelis can ask: "Why did you fight us before that?" They will demand Arab compensation for the so-called embargo on Israel and for the economic damage caused to the Israelis. If the Israelis sue you, they will win. They will say: We suffered an injustice. We are like an innocent lamb surrounded by wolves. We've been saying this since 1948."  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."    "We all know the Israeli aggression will not be without consequences.We all know our people have been oppressed by the Israeli occupation, but that doesn't mean we don't have a right to live in a land we migrated to and settled in." Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas PM, 03 Feb 2009 Al-Aqsa TV    "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it." - Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937  "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."  - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria." - Rep. of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956  Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated: "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."  ----------  Edit to Tap:  Incoming hostile Arabs with their own modern state are never considered indigenous no matter how long they remain. They have their own states and territories and always did.  They themselves called themselves Syrians. (see my quotes) and showed up to fight Israel (see history.)|`|UIJorsD7aa	"Stole?"

By the way Israel has attacked the Palestinian people for the past 60 years dailly, and turned it around making out the Palestinians where the agressors.    The fact is the Jews came from all over the world and set up home in Palestine and pushed ordinary Arabs of their land making them refugee's, then with the help of the British set up the state of Israel which even to this day still discriminates against Palestinians.    Lupines - Take religion out of it, before 1948 yes there where Jews in the region but there was a vast majority of Arabs.

The zionist dream of a great Israel which may include parts of Lebanon , Jordan , Syria, and Saudi Arabia. This dream can only be achieved by force. Now that it has so much of illegan weapons which was tested on people of Gaza, Israel try to scare Arabs so that they do not resist any occupation. Unfortanately USA with its super power is backing Israel and supporting its war crimes. I know many Americans who don't like that but they can't do much about it.|`|d9PdhBvMaa	The outrageous treatment as you call it is repelling attacks from muslim neighbours who want Jews and Israel out of the Middle East.  If Israel had been defeated in one of the wars launched by its neighbours would they give back the land after the war?    When muslim states attacked Israel and it seized the land it was conquered land. Why do some people find the truth so hard to understand?    The arabs are the aggressors and have been since day one.|`|YBbJ2QZJaa	The land you refer to was lost when the people on it attacked Israel.    Start a war and lose and you also lose land.    Solution:  Don't start a war you can't win.|`|dD983yn5aa	it's beyond me. Israel cries like a kid.|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	Perhaps its they just dont like being murdered by Hamas?  So far every time Arab nations try to kill everyone in Israel they have failed and during the fighting Israel has gained more land.  PS wouldnt it have been quicker for you to just type "I hate Jews"?|`|n9PUzlhzaa	So called Israel is an illegal and terrorist state and terrorist and illegal not obey the laws.
d9PdhBvMaa	Have any been proven or is this just so much propaganda?    Have Hamas apologised for the deaths of Israelis and Gazans caused by their homocidal actions? Surely these are the war criminals - targeting civilians in Gaza and Israel.|`|YBbJ2QZJaa	No need to.    No war crimes.    Propaganda.    Shame on you.

x3uCecWsaa	They are showing their true colours now, Hamas were NEVER interested of the welfare of their own people, or they would have stopped the rockets along time ago! Hamas are blinded with their hatred and destruction of the Israeli's to the detriment of their own people.    PS, I love your icon-the skin needs tightened up!!|`|GVg6mHI1aa	Seems a bit quiet from the usual anti Israel lot.   :)    Can't think why that is.  lol|`|7zZZEUxqaa	And how do you know he was not bringing this money for the support of Gaza people? If someone want to line their pwn pockets iwht cash as you said he will leave it outside Gaza, not bring it with him !|`|d9PdhBvMaa	Yes of course they will, they have been stealing aid to line their own pockets and to wage war with Israel.
