20090128220031AAIVS9e	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Where can I find a scrap aircraft fuselage?	I'm currently doing a design project for the final year of my BA Architecture degree. The project is all about converting a disused barn into a home.       I'm really into an architectural design group called LOT-EK from New York, who take objects and turn them into something new. Some of their projects have included taking a set of four shipping containers and turning them into a house, turning an old tube tv into a standing light and creating a media room out of a cement mixer.      Inspired by this I am creating a loft style space within the timber framed barn, designing a set of bathrooms in an oil tanker trailer stood on its end in one part of the room. I wanted to do something similar for a bedroom space but For me the oil tanker is a little small for this...anyway...      Basically what I want to do instead is use an old section of aircraft fuselage to span the 5 metre width of the barn, and I wanted to know what is the best aircraft to use and where in the UK (purely as research) can you find scrap aircraft.      I'm looking for something with between 5 feet 10 and 6 feet clearance for a person to stand in. I've been told something called an SF340 matches that, but anymore suggestions are welcome.      Thankyou!

I've recently had a car accident, and we forgot to buy insurance, my fault completely, and we were the driver at fault.      To settle it, we've agreed to pay the write-off or the lowest price to fix it. It seems to be heading along the way of a write off as the car is worth 4000-5000 and the repairs will cost me 4200 (at least), i just want to know when an insurance provider writes off your car they pay you their price that they think is fair, because we don't have those resources it will be decided by negotiation. If we pay the write off does that mean we can keep the other persons car for salvage? Thats what insurance providers do. Or is it negotiated?      If anyone has had similiar experiences please tell me what to do!       Thanks

20090129011309AAjMLRC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car doesn't slow to a smooth stop when stopping at stop lights..why?	I just had my front brakes done back in November.  Instead of slowing to a smooth stop, as I decelerate, you can feel the car rock back and forth, like in a front to back motion as I apply the brakes and come to a full stop.  It's like it wants to grab the brake in a fully smooth motion, but it doesn't.  It's like grabbing and releasing...I can't really explain it though.  It's annoying because it's kind loud when my brakes are applied.  It still squeals like it did before when my front pads were to minimum spec.  I thought it would go away because they were new...but the same squealing is still there.  I thought maybe it was because I got the cheap package of brakes- Bronze Front Brake Service Platinum Pkg from PepBoys.  Oh and also, about a year ago I ran over a big *** pot hole too..but I never got an alignment done.  I just had my tires replaced/rebalanced/rotated every 6k/brakes/brake flush/regular oil & filter changes every 3k.  I'm going to get an alignment done soon though anyway.  But I also wanted to know if the fact that I haven't had the alignment could have anything to do with the rocking of my brakes as well?   I don't drive aggressively either(obviously..since my car is only 80 torque..i can't go no where lol).  Regular use of hwy at speed limits and street use at speed limits.

20090128232917AAKiBxa	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Replace the engine or junk the whole car?	After 256,000 miles, the engine on my 93 Acura Vigor died and is unrepairable.  The rest of the vehicle has been well maintained and remains in very good condition.  I've always really liked that car and would like to be able to keep it, but I really question investing several thousand dollars into a vehicle this old.  Is it worth the cost to have a used engine installed in an otherwise good condition 16 year old car?  Or am I better off to just give up on it and buy another car altogether?         I have enough cash saved to either pay for the full repair or to buy a replacement used car for cash so availability of funds is not really a consideration - only the long-term benefit vs. cost.  Also, as far as I can tell, re-manufactured engines are not available for this vehicle because they are fairly rare and therefore a used engine is the only real repair option.

20090129000712AAxvJWD	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my Ohio Buick running so poorly on premium California Gas?	I drove my 2003 Buick Park Avenue Ultra from Ohio to California.  I have had the car for 2 years and have only filled it with regular gas.  I have never had any engine related trouble with it.  I have been in California for a month and the car is running poorly.  The first time I took it to the mechanic, the car was rattling on acceleration and the 'Service Engine Soon' light was flashing on and off.  The mechanic told me to use premium fuel instead.  The rattling went away, but the car now idles very rough.  Every 5-10 seconds the RPM drops and it sounds like it is misfiring.  The 'Service Engine Soon' light came back on and stayed on.  The mechanic said it was an old code that said misfiring cylinder and told me again to continue premium fuel.  It is now my fourth tank of California premium and the car still idles rough, and the 'Service Engine Soon' light is still on.  What do I do?

The body and interior is virtually mint and all original. The seller (retired diesel Mechanic) said he personally rebuilt the Engine at 125K... NOW I'm a car guy and builder and I am no dummy when it comes to the mechanics and I know a good deal when I see one. This Nova ran great with no issues what so ever. I decided that I wanted to go to a 383 cu and turbo 400 Tranny. I pulled the engine out and took it apart...I was floored in what I found....3 of the cylinders were Standard size....2 of them were .030 over...and the rest were .060 over size....NOW tell me why someone would rebuild an engine in this manner??

20090128220112AAEDeAj	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mercedes-Benz	A question about Mercedes wholesale price!?	Hey guys,   Im looking for a new car and a mate of mine said he knows a guy would look out for me and allow me to purchase a brandnew Mercedes' (no idea of the model.. but thats not important for this question -- whats important are the figures he was talking) from a wholesaler.. at cost (all legit!). The figures he was talking were he (the wholesaler) was getting the cars at $80,000 Australian Dollars -- onselling to dealers at AUD$95,000 and the dealers would sell them to customers at AUD$140,000! So in effect, I would get a AUD$140,000 car for AUD$80,000.       Just wondering if anyone in the know could confirm if these figures sound about right for the prices each respective individual in the chain (wholsesaler, dealer and customer) will pay for the car. His not a guy that talks sh!t, but that definitely seems like a massive difference between what the wholesaler pays and what the customer ultimately pays.       Cheers guys!

Any ideas on what or where to check?

I was in the right lane (closet to the curb heading east)and the semi was in the left lane. We were both going the same direction at about the same speed. (30 mph) I was slightly in front of the truck. My rear driverside tire about even with trucks front passenger side tire. All of a sudden the truck begins to merge and smacks the rear quarter panel of my driverside. he was stuck to me until he got back into his lane and stopped. I then pressed the brakes and stopped. My car had turned to the left about 45-50degrees. He did not hit the front of my car at all. We both went thru the next light and pulled over. I am 8 months pregnant and used my hands on the wheel to brace myself not wanting my stomach to hit the steering wheel. I am having pain in my left wrist and elbow as well as my back and neck.The store truck driver did not speak english and called his supervisor who advised him not to call the police, to get my information and give me his also. I do not have a cell phone. It was 6 am wednesday morning and there was no phones around. he would not let me use his phone to call the police. So there was no police report made or filed. We exchanged information. He took pictures of the car and me. After I had his information I drove 9 blocks home. My car is damaged. There is a dent about 2 feet long and .75of an inch deep. Also light on the side is damaged and broken off. My rear tire on the driverside is pushed inward and crooked. It now sits at a slant. the car was pulling left as I drove home. I am completely frazzled and have a lot of anxiety. Also this is too much for a pregnant woman to go thru. Emotionally and mentally. I have no way to get to the doctors now...unless I take an ambulance. I was able to get to the emergency room at 6 pm that night.Much more sore than when the accident occured.They gave me several tests and xrays. determined that I had a strained wrist and neck and back. The baby was fine.      The truck driver is at fault correct??   What kind of claims do I have?   How much can I actually recieve from a settlement?   Someone help me....should I get a lawyer the ones that say that they will file the case with no upfront fees and I pay only if I win the settlement??

20090129032551AAlc7oG	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Please Help i need advice?	had an accident about 3 weeks ago and it was not my fault. I was hit from the rear. Ever since then i have had a sore lower back, left butt cheek and pain shooting straight to my ankle which in turn has made my lower part of the ankle and last three toes slightly numb and tingly. I have been going to chiro for the past couple of weeks and see no improvement. I had X rays which said i have mild scoliosis (which is obviously not from the accident) but also my pelvis is not aligned and the reason for my pain in my left but cheek to my ankle is from a nerve.. Some days i can not get out of bed and i have not been able to sit down or even drive a car i always have to lie flat so there is no pain. Its like a cramping feeling all the way down. Could this be from the accident ?? I do not have ANY history of any back problems and am healthy as a fiddle and this all started a day after the accident, but not as bad as what it is now. Do I have a case if i bring it towards my insurance company. I have also had about 2 weeks off week and am still off as i work in a call centre and my job is to sit down which i cant and also can not drive there. Please Help guys should i seek legal advice as this has already cost me alot in chiro bills etc.. also with the nerve damage, pelvis alignment and scoliosis is that likely to stay with me? not sure how i would go with making a compo claim as im scared this may haunt me in the future. Also im not sure with the scoliosis considering i have never had any back issues what so ever in my life and the accident has triggered it earlier, if they would take that into consideration and with the nerve i mean is there any way of telling whether it will ever come back??
