20090227101605AAn9cEx	Business & Finance;Taxes;Canada	Why do I keep getting audited/reviewed?	Every year for the past 4 my returns are called into question.  Everytime I have been right, and CRA allowed my return to stay as is.  It is getting ridiculous though.  A week after I had my first baby, my entire 5 years of tuition was reviewed - they wanted literally everything (certificate, grades, all receipts, school tax forms, etc...etc...).  I spent so much time putting this together, and again, everything was correct.  I have never lied on a return and they are fairly basic returns - rent, rrsp, tuition, and T4.  I file online, is it true that has something to do with it? Even my GST refunds from years ago have been looked into (I haven't qualified for it for a few years now though).  Did I piss someone off?

They have stated they will be inspecting on Wednesday between 8:30am and 5:30pm and that I do not have to be there, as they will use the offices master key to gain entry.      My first question is... Do they have to give a specific time? Or are they able to give a wide time range like they have?      My second question... Can they access the premises with their Master Key if I'm not happy with it, and the fact that I cannot be there for the whole day? I can be there between 8:30am and 2pm.      Thanks in advance :)

20090307222006AAS5aTE	Business & Finance;Investing	Options Trading... When entering a CREDIT SPREAD such as Bull Put or Bear Call spread the margin requirement?	is the difference between the 2 strikes... so for instance buy $37.50PUT, sell $40PUT... Margin required is $250 per contract.      Assuming the above is correct... How does the debit spread work? Assume instead of taking the above position as a credit put spread, I chose to do a Bull Call spread, buying the $37.50CALL and selling the $40 CALL. for a net debit of $1.45...      Is there a margin requirement in that case? and if yes what would it be?         Thank you all

I just read in a magazine called "The Ontario Technologist" (CANADA), that everyone is worried about the up coming "Ontario workforce shortage"!      It seems that by 2025 it is estimated that Ontario alone will have a shortage of over 360,000 skilled workers and that we desperately need to import skilled workers from out of province.      There are now symposiums being held in Toronto on trying to figure out how to tackle this issue and what should be done about it.      This is a HUGE shortage of skilled workers!      My question is:  Are there really a huge shortage of skilled workers, such that even with a high unemployment problem in America, we still cannot find the workers that we need to fill all of these hundreds of thousands of jobs going begging?

20090307212502AAaURuE	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Freezing Bank Accounts due to Judgement?	I really would like some helpful advice and hope that anyone with rude or hurtful opinions will keep away. I live in Illinois and opened a credit card in 2004 and closed it in 2005 owing a balance of 1500. Since then that account was sold to a collection company that has a legal department too. They placed a judgement on my credit for 2400. I was then able to began to pay it off in 2008 but was unable to finish making payments as my income became extremely tight where I had to decide to buy groceries or pay the rent. I never told them where I worked, but I would sometimes pay with the debit card attached to my bank account. By the end of 2008 I had missed payments and they have now put through a garnishment/freeze of accounts. I only owe them a remaining 900 but I just need a new payment plan and that is not possible. So, please don't think that I am just trying to avoid paying them, I just needed a little time to get back on track and finish paying them. Now they have contacted the bank that I was using for direct deposit at my job but now that account is closed and as of yesterday I no longer work at that job. The letter to the bank is a citation notice for the bank to place a freeze on the account and disclose all information needed to the debt company by April 6. Since that bank account has been closed for some months now and since I no longer work at the job that was tied to that bank account, how long do I have before they find out about my new job ?  I just need about 4 months to save up the 900 and just give it to them.

I no longer work and thought I could afford to make payments when I had a job.  The dealership hasn't found a bank to finance me because all the credit union that called me to verify credit and employment, I told them I was not employed (which is the truth).  So the loans was denied.
20090307232041AANoHde	Business & Finance;Insurance	How does a deductible work?	I already read some answers, but I'm still confused. For instance, I got a quote from Aetna that the deductible is $7,500, co insurance is 30%, and office visit is 30% after deductible. Let's say that after I get approved I got to a doctor. Will I need to pay the $7,500 before the insurance pays this doctor, or will I pay only 30% of the total cost of the visit? As I understand I need to meet the deductible before the insurance pays anything.      Thank you so much,   Pedro

20090227115230AAhSbLH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I have accepted a job offer and start in 3 days. I was just offered a position with another company.?	The job I accepted pays a base of 40,000 plus commission of around 20-25,000 at quota plus a 4,000 year end bonus for profit. They pay out mileage for vehicle use and reimburse 5,000 per year in tuition for masters degrees. I start this job Monday and they have set me up with my plane ticket and hotel to go to the office to meet and greet and a week of product training. I told all of my interviewers that I had taken the offer. However, I forgot to tell one. They offered me a similar position today. The pay is 55,000 plus a bonus package of 15,000. The dollar comps are a wash. However, they will cut me a check to buy a company vehicle and will reimburse 100% of tuition with an A grade 90% B 80% C uncapped. The jobs being very similar and having accepted an offer is it in bad taste to go for the better perks on such short notice? I would love to jump on the new offer but feel bad about doing so. Any advice?
20090227115401AA6WId5	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Did I get the job? And if so or not how do you know?	Applied on Monday at UCP. They called on Tuesday, interview on Wednesday. They Called Thursday, interview on Friday(today). So at the 2nd interview, she said she still had paperwork to fill out and that HR will contact me. If not she said call her so I can find out what happened to my application to see if it got lost. I know...wait and see...but I'm not sure, because usually at 2nd interviews they give you the drug test and the job offer. She says its up to her boss, HR. They give the final word. I'm just hoping......

20090227115503AAZnw3Z	Business & Finance;Credit	Any attorneys out there or anyone with experience in being subpoenaed over unpaid bills?	I am in serious financial distress right now. I am on unpaid family leave/disability until mid-May due to complications with pre-eclampsia after my baby was born in Nov.       I have a school loan that is now being handled by a law firm. I had tried over the last six months to contact, in writing,the credit collection agencies that were handling the loan but no one would respond to my inquiries. Now this law firm is handling the account and they are very difficult to deal with on the phone. I've made two attempts to talk with their staff but they just bark at me, make personal attacks and I end up getting nowhere even though my intent is to resolve this debt. They tell me they won't settle for less than 20% of the balance which is $2000 that I don't have, and that it would have to be paid off in one year. Considering the rest of my debt, this is simply undoable.      Anyway, I believe the case has now been filed in court and I am waiting nervously to see when I'll be subpoenaed. A friend of mine suggested not answering the door so that I will have more time because supposedly I'll have 30 days to respond AFTER the subpoena is handed to me. Now I'm not answering the door but it is difficult because we get so many solicitors in this neighborhood and there's always people coming to the door.      Anyone have any suggestions or experience with this kind of issue? PLEASE, don't send me negative, discouraging remarks about my predicament. I'm feeling very distressed as it is and need people who will be non-judgmental.      Thanks so much.
