I need some help determining which stage of demographic transition would these countries be in based on their change in fertility rate from 1960 to 2010.      Bangladesh= 6.85 – 2.63 = 4.22   Canada= 3.68 – 1.53 = 2.15   Germany= 2.49 – 1.39 = 1.1   Iran= 7.0 – 1.97 = 5.03   Malaysia= 6.72 – 2.37 = 4.35   Philippines= 6.85 – 2.89 = 3.96   Poland= 2.65 – 1.25 = 1.40   Zambia= 7.15 – 4.67 = 2.48      The choices for the stages are:   1. Pre-transition   2. Early transition   3. Late transition   4. Post-transition      -thanks

20090309190005AAG0Tu6	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Is this true? Number Theory/Abstract algebra question about units?	From Wikipedia:      The units of the ring Z/nZ are the numbers coprime to n. They form a group under multiplication modulo n with φ(n) elements (see above). It is written as (Z/nZ)*. For example, we get (Z/nZ)* = {1,5} when n = 6, and get (Z/nZ)* = {1,3,5,7} when n = 8.      In fact, it is known that (Z/nZ)* is cyclic if and only if n is 1 or 2 or 4 or p^k or 2p^k for some odd prime number p and k ≥ 1, in which case every generator of (Z/nZ)* is called a primitive root modulo n. Thus, (Z/nZ)* is cyclic for n = 6, but not for n = 8, where it is instead isomorphic to the Klein four-group.      Does this mean if we have a group of units, say (Z/11Z)* (is this equal to U11...the group of units of the group Z11?) [when I say U11 and Z11, the 11 is supposed to be subscripted], then we can immediately say it is cyclic simply because 11 = 11^1, since p=11, which is an uneven prime, and k=1?

20090309193316AAjM6XU	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Can someone please explain this scientific abstract to me?	Hi, I'm writing a lab report on Tuberculosis due tomorrow, and I need to incorporate this article but it's soooo confusing (as all abstracts are) and filled to the brim with scientific jargon :'(       I do know that it talks about the dormancy of latent Tuberculosis, but that's about it! :(      Are there any biology experts out there who can help explain this/summarize this for me in ENGLISH? (Heh). Thank you so much!!      here's the link:    http://www.springerlink.com/content/p133...       (and here's the text, just in case it doesn't work:)   "Abstract.  There is ample circumstantial evidence from observation of the natural history of tuberculosis in humans and experimental animals that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is capable of adapting to prolonged periods of dormancy in tissues, and that these dormant bacilli are responsible for latency of the disease itself. Furthermore, the dormant bacilli are resistant to killing by antimycobacterial agents. A systematic evaluation of the mechanism of dormancy, and of attempts to abrogate latency will require a better understanding of the physiologic events that attend the shiftdown into dormancy. There are probably two or more stages in the shiftdown of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from active replication to dormancy as bacilli in unagitated cultures settle through a self-generated O2 gradient into a sediment where O2 is severely limited. One step involves a shift from rapid to slow replication. The other involves complete shutdown of replication, but not death. Presumably this last step includes completion of a round of DNA synthesis. The shiftup on resumption of aeration includes at least three discrete sequential steps, the production of RNA, the ensuing synchronized cell division and, finally, the initiation of a new round of synthesis of DNA. Three markers of the process of shiftdown ofMycobacterium tuberculosis to dormancy have been described, namely the changes in tolerance to anaerobiosis, the production of a unique antigen and the ten-fold increase in glycine dehydrogenase production. Additional markers represented in the shiftup and shiftdown process may yet be discovered, and determination of their specific functions should provide insights into the mechanisms of dormancy and latency in tuberculosis, and into strategies for preventing reactivation of the bacilli and development of disease."

I have looked in my book and notes and cannot find ANYTHING telling if the epicenter is always the most damaged. I fear it may be kind of a trick question because of the word "always" and because it sounds very logical. Does anyone have an idea if this question is true of false?

20080228212427AAmUtbT	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	DNA testing for family connection?	It has recently come to my attention that someone I know (who was adopted) had the same original last name (before it was changed by his new parents) as my own. We're really close, and in fact, though as far as we know we are not related, we think of each other as family. So when I found out what his original last name was I started wondering if there was a chance we might be related after all. It is probably the power of suggestion, but sometimes I even think I see a family resemblance.   My question - would a DNA test be able to determine if we are in fact related, and how closely related? If so, how reliably? The common ancestor, if there is one, could be several generations in the past.

20081022170618AAaMYvw	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	8th grade Science Fair Project...Any Ideas?	I'm in the 8th grade am being forced to participate in Science Fair.  The category isn't very important but 8th grade is Physical science so that would be fine.  The problem statement is due in a day or two and i am completely stuck on what to do.  Last year I did a simple project on laundry detergent but for 8th grade honors you need a bit more.  Help?

20081030053833AAawK5x	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS MATH GAME!?!? (EASY 10 Pts)?	You want to make your next-to-last move so your opponent is left with 5 stones. That way no matter how many he takes, you will be able to take the last one. And you work backwards up the numbers. To be sure you can leave your opponent with 5 stones, move so he has exactly 10 left on your second-to-last move. That way you will be able to take 1-4 stones and leave him with 5. So as you have given the rules, you will win if you can move so as to leave your opponent a multiple of 5 stones. (The general solution is to leave a multiple of one more than the maximum stones that can be taken in one move. Thus 4+1=5 for your case.) If there are a multiple of 5 stones when it is your move, you cannot force a win but your opponent can.
