CD1T7gaXaa	First of all, nobody should leave America because of the different opinions people have. Like it or not, people are entitled to have their own opinions about how the government and economic system should work.<br>  Moving on, how different is it for a government to run businesses than it is for businesses to run the government? Either way there are a handful of people calling all the shots. Both Capitalism and Socialism are capable of creating misery and injustice on a massive scale. As messy as it is, most countries, including the USA, have elements from both systems. The idea is to address faults from either system with the strong points of the other. Until I learn of something better, I have no reasonable objection to this. <br>  Ultimately it depends on the character and wisdom of the leaders.

THAT is the problem.  If there was a way for America to becomea socialist nation so that everyone was happy and we had no more economic strife, I don't think anyone would care.  The problem is, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.  Name one successful socialist nation in the history of time.  Waiting...still waiting....oh wait, that's right - there are none!  You can't tax the rich and give to the poor because it simply doesn't work.  It sounds nice to all of the morons who know nothing about the economy (like all the idiots who went out and voted for Obama - "he's gonna pay my mortgage!  He's gonna put gas in my car!") but the rest of us know that if you tax the rich heavily, if you tax big business heavily, if you increase payroll taxes and capital gains tax, the net result is a HUGE loss of jobs.  A tax cut is not going to help someone who is not making any income because they are jobless.  Also, businesses will have to raise the cost of their goods and services to compensate for the loss of income.  Do you think the rich CEO's of the big corporations are just going to say "well, Obama says I make too much and it's not fair, and I should give that money back to the poor people, so I'm not going to raise the cost of my goods and services or cut jobs so I can continue to make the same amount of money, I'm just going to take a huge pay cut."  Of course not!  Seriously, how naive are you people???

Check Chavez, who may be a hero of yours, as he is to many on the left.<br>  <br>  Democrats have almost exclusively caused our current economic problems, by<br>  1. Destroying the root of our economy by obstructing access to any economical fuel sources including oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydro electric, clean coal and anything else that could sustain a healthy economy. Fuel is the very core of our economy and they crushed it.<br>  <br>  2. The democrats deliberately pushed the core of the credit crisis, and ignored warnings that things were being done by Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae that would be very harmful to our economy, by the Bush administration, and even John McCain. The democrats buddies in Freddy Mac and Fannie May (powerful advisers in the Obama campaign and huge democrat contributors to Obama, Frank, Dodd, Waters, and Reid among other democrats started out on a dangerous course, lied to investors about the status of the investment, and caused the credit crisis and the bringing down of banks and insurance companies because of those investments becoming worthless as collateral, making those institutions illiquid and thus unable to legally do business ... this sent a chill through all lending institutions and froze up credit which has lead to this disaster in the economy ... accomplished by democrats with a few idiot republicans help. The worst thing any republican ever did in the last 8 years, even 16, was to go along with democrats and try to work with them. They are the bane of the US economy, and it was caused by their lust for power and their greed ... as well as the accomplice of the liberal media and entertainment industry in this country working to push their lies and deceptions on the people of the US, and even the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  Fuel being so high was the catalyst that caused the problems with the mortgage backed securities to come out like they did, and this destroyed the backbone of commerce and industry in the US and weighed so heavy on the world that the rest of the world could not bear the weight.<br>  <br>  I also think China was deliberately driving up fuel prices and pushing things to a head, maybe working with some US politicians like the Clintons to make this happen, so things would be ripe for Hilary's presidential bid. This kind of thing is classic Clinton, if you really know how the man has worked in the past to get what he wanted. His mob exploits are long and detailed, and he thinks very big of course, afraid of nothing and knowing no limits.<br>  <br>  This whole thing has effected the entire world, and it all goes back to what democrats have been pushing for decades. The press has been with them. The press is actually THE power, as they inform the voting public, or in the last decades they deliberately misinform the public to help the democrats gain power.|`|11dGXLchaa	Go to Cuba, take a look around, and then answer your own question.

Congress has passed many laws down through the years that the courts later struck down as unconstitutional.  For example, Congress passed the line-item veto in the 1990s, but the Supreme Court struck it down.  That didn't make the entire Congress liable for impeachment.  It's just the way the system of checks and balances works.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If someone thinks an executive branch official has violated the Constitution, then that person can sue as well.  <br>  <br>  That's why we have federal courts.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't be an impeachable offense unless there is a federal law describing the act as a CRIME.  If you can find a federal law that characterizes trying to implement a policy as a crime, then you can impeach.  Not before that.  <br>  <br>  That's the way it works--there has to be a crime before you can impeach, and there is no crime unless a written criminal law has been violated.|`|k0jcYvX0aa	What Constitutional Articles are you referring to?

For instance, where they apply, you have a right to be heard by an impartial decision-maker.<br>  <br>  If a court decides to award damages to the plaintiff without giving the defendant the opportunity to respond to the allegations, for example, that contravenes the principles of natural justice.  If a Tribunal member has a conflict of interest but doesn't recuse himself, that contravenes the principles of natural justice.<br>  <br>  Nobody's going to be 'charged' for offending natural justice.  This is the sort of thing that's remedied by appeal or certiorari.<br>  <br>  That said, where a party acts in a way that offends the principles of natural justice (not making required disclosure, etc), there are often sanctions for that sort of behaviour as against the party.|`|1d52d8828a9e23c128eb46cbcd0da1e2aa	I guess that would depend on what you consider to be natural justice. There are a few natural laws are actual crimes. Killing is considered to be wrong in nearly all cultures and is probably a "natural crime." Theft is considered wrong in all cultures. So, I would say yes. A lot of  our criminal laws (at least the major ones) reflect natural law.

And unlike the Army, you can't guarantee those types of schools on your contract, you have to be selected.  So to answer your question that, yes, you can go to Airborne school, but it won't be right away.|`|uj4Dv8awaa	No not really is very hard to get airborne in the marines. If you have decided to be Recon Marine and finish all the training neccessary its guaranteed. I'm in airborne school right now and the and almost all of the marines are Force Recon. So yes but its hard to get into airborne school if your not in the army. Most of who attend from other branches are combat divers,Navy Seals, Forward air controllers, Force Recon, and some other specialties|`|ZDf2jgVQaa	the only way 2 be jumped trained in the corps is 2 be assigned an mos. that requires it. recon. would be ur best bet. u have 2 make through boot first and the ask 4 orders 4 recon. school. good luck.

Most of our country are not rednecks & they are the only people who voted for McCain. There were problems in some places but I didn't have any trouble. Yes, my person was Obama & he obviously won. No, I didn't think it was rigged but could have been in some places.

T0pkW783aa	The Libs are all for big government and want to be taken care of; they think that all the big spending, the redistribution of wealth and all the promises that Obama has made and can't possibly keep is a solution to the state we are in.  They don't realize that we are digging a bigger hole and we can't get out of it for many, many years with the solutions that the Socialist President is offering.  Signing bills filled with pork and unnecessary expenses when we are in way over our heads is insane!!  Signing bills without even reading them; without even knowing what they include is downright stupid.  Rush points out the truth to the public and the "Obama Kool-aid drinkers" feel threatened that Rush will get publicity and maybe a bigger following of believers.  They are afraid of his power.  They would rather have talk radio shut down so they don't have to listen to reality.  "Never-neverland is where they reside, not believing that their dreams are "never, never" going to come true!!

fyWbMXOHaa	Everyone signs this release whether they have been in trouble or not. What he is more then likely doing is trying to get the court records, which depending on what you were in trouble for is necessary. The time will depend on how long the courts take to get the records to him, then depends on what he reads in there. It could require a waiver, which will take more time. That amount of time depends on what kind of waiver you need. Recruiters are usually pretty good at estimating time with things like this. No matter what branch you go into they all have to go through the same process basically. Learn patience now, you will need plenty of it in the military.|`|9I3wHIdraa	You may have the same situation when you see the Army recruiter, background checks are typical and they take time.

Now unions may sound left wing, but they aren't.  They simply served to balance the power between employer and employee.  Employers may not like that, and might prefer to be petty tyrants, but that's why there were unions in the first place.<br>  When the people in power start using propaganda to make you hate unions take note, nothing good for the average man is in their pipeline.<br>  We don't need to go right or left, we need to stop the inane labeling and look at what we need and would benefit from, not just rich people, the core of trickle down theorists, but everyone.

(another example of reasons to use sources other than "wikipedia")<br>  <br>  rather, the term refers to acts of "civil disobedience" (the common term for such acts is "riots", or "rioting").<br>  <br>  "civil war" is what this country experienced in the mid-1800's when the northern "union" armies battled the southern "confederate" armies.<br>  <br>  the "Rodney King riots" in Los Angeles in 1994, the "Watt's riots" of the 1960's, and the 1999 riots in Seattle during the WTO (World Trade Organization) convention are examples of "civil strife", "civil unrest", or "civil riots".<br>  <br>  "civil" - as used in this term - refers to regional, municipal, or local.  "strife" is defined as "bitter conflict; heated often violent dissension".  the term is used most commonly in association with chaotic, violent, non-unified actions related to a particular issue.<br>  <br>  there are probably hundreds of examples which could correctly be cited as cases of "civil strife" or "civil disturbance".<br>  <br>  not included, by definition, would be acts such as the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, or the acts of "unabomber" Ted Kaczynski - which are defined as acts of "domestic terrorism" carried out by either a single individual or very small group of co-conspirators where much advance planning and coordination is involved.|`|74f74357f1e97881285bef9af7de548faa	Nick ris correct but he left out a few examples<br>  <br>  Chicago riots at the Democratic Convention in the 60's<br>  Memphis Riots after the death of MLK<br>  Dallas Riot after the cowboys won SB in 1993|`|U95m4LhAaa	It's another way of saying 'civil war':<br>  <br>  A civil war is a war between organized groups to take control of a nation or region, or to change government policies.[1] It is high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars result in large numbers of casualties and the expenditure of large amounts of resource. A civil war involves two-sided violence; for example, a massacre of civilians by the state is not a civil war. Similarly, less intense forms of societal conflict, such as riots or social movements, are excluded from the definition.

And They feel as though there votes will not make a difference due to the way the electoral system is set up. So many states are already predetermined before election day. To fix this we need a revolution of sorts to spur public interest into understanding their votes are Crucial in elections and not just a waste of time. I also believe presidential elections should be determined by popular vote not the electoral college. This past election would have been different if there would have been a Conservative running against Obama. Because the Conservatives would have united instead of sitting home on Nov 4th.

Why should I vote if those nine allegedly objective interpreters of the law -- the most important interpreters of law in the land that we have -- issue a ruling that they won't allow every vote to be counted in an extremely close presidential election?

8hAhmlJjaa	To answer your first question, "Can cops give tickets if they are off duty?"  Yes they can.  Cops are considered to be on duty at all times, however most departments do not want them writng tickets off duty.  They do expect them to handle life-threatening situations off duty, that is why they are required to carry a firearm with them.<br>  <br>  To put your mind at rest, this guy was probably not a cop or he would have approached you to speak with you about the near accident.<br>  <br>  To answer your second question, "Does anyone have an idea of what this weird guy may have done?"  He was probably mad, aggrevated, or whatever about the near accident and was blaming you.  He was most likely calling the police department to report you.  Had that been done, they would have responded to the parking lot and talked with you.  So he was probably just trying to put a scare into you, and it looks like it worked.<br>  <br>  Just be careful out there, slow down, leave more room between you and the other drivers, and wear your seat belt.|`|VP1yQRwNaa	Unless they are drunk or drinking, every department I know considers their cops on duty 24/7/365|`|0UV0PwDLaa	I doubt he is a cop, sounds like an idiot to me.

To answer your question, as least in my area, police can write tickets off duty but it is a very rare instance and usually very deserving. My advice to you is SLOW DOWN and stop following so closely. I have dealt with many situations similar to yours and it almost always has to do with driving too fast or following to close.|`|OVUkamlpaa	You say "the jerk in front of me slams on his brakes". <br>  <br>  You are required, by law,  to keep a safe distance between you and the car ahead of you.

Your question puts a finger on one of the reasons.<br>  <br>  Obama is a Usurper of the powers of the United States. As such, he can't legally use those powers to do anything. Not even if it's a "good idea." Obama's occupancy of the presidency is a constitutional obstruction to the validity of governmental action. If the United States is attacked while Obama pretends to be President, our military commanders will have to form an extra-governmental authority in order to conduct our defense. If they obey Obama's orders or otherwise recognize Obama's authority over them, even during a war, they are committing treason, a capital crime.<br>  <br>  Likewise, those state governors probably understand that they will be committing treason if they "adhere" to Obama by accepting federal money from his hand. That, too, is treason because it seems to legitimize an enemy of the Constitution, which is what a Usurper always is, whether he likes it or not.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Each and every one of those governors will lose the upcoming elections if they are running again.<br>  <br>  You're right.

pss8LblLaa	After Basic Training you will attend a technical school to learn your specific Air Force job.  In the Air Force your job is indicated by a code called AFSC (Air Force Specialty Code).  Your AFSC will determine where your training takes place and how long the training is.  During the course of your training you will receive orders for your first assignment location.  Once training is complete you will then be sent to your first duty assignment.  The time spent at your first duty assignment will depend on it's location and whether you actively pursue getting a new duty assignment location.  During the course of your 4 years, after you have arrived at your first duty assignment, you have the potential to be deployed to another location temporarily to do your job for anywhere from 4-12 months.  A good example of this would be being sent to Afghanistan for 4 months to do your job then returning to the base you are assigned once the temporary duty is completed.  Since your question doesn't really specify what you mean by away (away from your hometown, away from continental U.S., away from your family) it's hard to answer it very specifically so I tried to give you a broad idea of what your travels are like for your first 4 years.  Good luck.|`|uj4Dv8awaa	Nooo man. Its nothing like that after basic you go to train for your specialty.<br>  You dont have to be gone for long if you choose reserves or something similar.

gsKfSkJ1aa	Amazing. As an explanation of our current economic difficulties, this is total fantasy. As a cure for rapidly growing joblessness, a massive destruction of wealth, a deepening worldwide recession, this is perhaps the greatest non sequitur ever foisted upon the American people.<br>  <br>  At the very center of our economic near-depression is a credit bubble, a housing collapse and a systemic failure of the entire banking system. One can come up with a host of causes: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pushed by Washington (and greed) into improvident loans, corrupted bond-ratings agencies, insufficient regulation of new and exotic debt instruments, the easy money policy of Alan Greenspan's Fed, irresponsible bankers pushing (and then unloading in packaged loan instruments) highly dubious mortgages, greedy house-flippers, deceitful homebuyers. <br>  <br>  The list is long. But the list of causes of the collapse of the financial system does not include the absence of universal health care, let alone of computerized medical records. Nor the absence of an industry-killing cap-and-trade carbon levy. Nor the lack of college graduates. Indeed, one could perversely make the case that, if anything, the proliferation of overeducated, Gucci-wearing, smart-*** MBAs inventing ever more sophisticated and opaque mathematical models and debt instruments helped get us into this credit catastrophe in the first place.<br>  <br>  And yet with our financial house on fire, Obama makes clear both in his speech and his budget that the essence of his presidency will be the transformation of health care, education and energy. Four months after winning the election, six weeks after his swearing in, Obama has yet to unveil a plan to deal with the banking crisis.
b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Easy target for the non-thinking group.<br>  I saw a comparison with FDR that read "the stock market rebounded soon after FDRs election." But the depression had been ongoing for three years before that. This deep recession began only a few months before Obama came into office.Many peopleexpect a magic bullet to solve the problem. There is no such animal. It will take time.|`|3UTlASavaa	You need to understand the markets to get a full understanding of why this drop since Nov 4th clearly indicts Obama.  It would take a semester course of understanding the idea of discounted cash flows and the concept of future value.  Since I can't do that here let's try something simple.  <br>  <br>  If on Nov 3rd I understood that the economy was in terrible shape (outside of Obama's policies nothing has really changed since then) and I was valuing stocks I would take into account the fact that the economy was in terrible shape.  I would make some assumptions about the future (e.g. I don't expect the government to go into massive debt to spend money on non-private sector items or to enter into social projects while the economy is in such terrible shape).<br>  <br>  Once Obama became the President Elect and began nominating individuals it became clear that the government would be partisan and oddly incompetent - the market took that into account and dropped.<br>  <br>  Once Obama got into office it became clear that the government was going to pursue and dangerous economic policy of borrowing vast amounts of money from unknown (but assumed to exist) sources raising fears of inflation, etc.  The market took that into account and dropped.<br>  <br>  If the market did not have all the effects of the terrible economy factored into its valuations as of 11/3/08 those who knew that it was in worse shape than it appeared could make substantial profits by selling stocks short (in essence a bet that the market would drop).  Since there haven't been fortunes made on that bet I would assume that the drop in the market since Obama's election and its continuation since his inauguration are directly linked to his actions and policies.  To assume otherwise would be to assume an irrational market and there is just too much money at stake to give that much credence.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if this is a little professorial but you need to understand that there really is something to the claim that the drop is a referendum on Obama's policies.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	the only way you could blame Obama is to blame him for being one out out hundreds of senators and representatives...and hundreds of Executive branch appointees...and President Bush and Cabinet.....it didn't take us 2 years to get into this mess....if you look at the slide in value of the dollar since 2005, you can see when the past failed policies began to appear...but the cause is certainly before that.....you can blame Clinton (and to be fair the Repub. congress at the time) thru the '90's...but the Captain at the ship at the time we hit the ice berg was Bush and the Republican Congress....2005|`|ujIinLzGaa	The problems started after the democrats took control of the Congress in the 2006 elections.

That's in 4 mnths. 5 days as opposed to your 6 mnth. time period. Yes the Dow has been dropping but there has been significant sideways movement in there too. Since Obomber has entered into office there's been a constant and consistent decline in the trend. Out of the seven weeks he's been in office the $DJI has had only one up week. That week didn't even take it above the open of the week he was sworn in. Yesterday closed out our fourth straight down week. The week of 2/23 having the least lose of $303.06. The Dow is now below the trend line that goes all the way back to 1932. That trend line is (well was) a level of support.

A couple days ago, the market went up big, because of a rumour that China would be announcing a new 700 billion  stimulus plan.

When the "leader" of the GOP is forced to apologize for criticizing the talk show host, it should tell you about his level of influence on a wounded party.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	While I agree that what we put our attention on grows, what I see is by bringing out & revealing Rush is going to make his popularity decrease. How many of his listeners really look for accuracacy in what he is saying? How many get the transcripts of what he says & take out the emotional stuff to look for substance? I do healing work & most of what brings about healing is by focusing on what you want rather than what you don't want. Yet sometimes a person has to face what is there to get it out in the open. I was on pain pills years ago & couldn't sleep or work without them. So I decided I was going to get off the pills. I had to be willing to look at what was hurting me. The pain was in my feet & legs (I also had diabetes at that time) I had to face that I was hurt over my son dying at such a young age & everything that went with it. As soon as I saw that I chose to let that hurt me I was able to let it go & chose to feel good. I have been off the pills for over a  year now & off of diabetic meds also but had to do other work on that. So exposeing the republicans is going to get us to do work that needs to be done. This is very important for democrats & evenutally will bring about healing (coming together like when you have a cut finer heal) as long as we are divided we are not healed.

I agree that though Rush as been popular, mainly with his audience like myself, he was at his superstar status in the mid 1990's and he got tons of attention from both sides.<br>  <br>  The Democrats have had their moments though within the last year and they keep shining the spotlight even brighter on Rush. For example, the letter that Harry Reid sent to Rush's boss that was signed by 41 Democrats. This got people really fired up, even people that don't really like Rush all that much. It was because the government was trying to silence him.....alot of people don't agree with that, not matter what your politics.<br>  <br>  Here's Rush firing up conservatives and making people laugh at Democrats: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppO7hF7ugY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppO7hF7u...</a><br>  <br>  You are right, you don't give attention to a guy that speaks articulately and can get people to think about the issues at hand. Obama mentions Rush, the liberal media mentions him. People start to ask themselves, "What is this guy Rush all about, what's he saying?". So....they tune in to hear him. lol<br>  <br>  Democrats should just ignore Rush. That is the best way to beat him.|`|NJtFYQ96aa	Rush Limbaugh isn't a trend or fad dear, Rush is always in style and always up to date and fresh, that's why people listen when he talks, If he was the nobody that you say he is, then why is he in the spot light right now ?

mfYfeFCgaa	Yup. Man made alcohol, God made marijuana.

Along with the fact that it was primarily Mexicans and African Americans in the 30's who smoked it, racist propaganda was promoted criticizing its usage and claiming that those people who smoked became psychotic murderers which is definitely BS. The US government believed the media and made a ban on Marijuana from then on (as of 1937 I think).<br>  <br>  Marijuana has already been shown in some studies to provide pain relief to those who have cancer, glaucoma and AIDS if smoked in small amounts. Also there's been ZERO recorded deaths on anybody who has taken Marijuana itself. Compare that with alcohol related deaths (several 100,000s/yr, especially violence and drink driving) and there's a HUGE difference.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is slightly better than tobacco seeing that it does provide pain relief (that's 1 positive thing) even though it produces carcinogens when smoked. However you can bypass that by using a vaporizer or just by eating it in!<br>  <br>  And Marijuana can be easily grown seeing that it's a weed. I think that's another reason why nearly all governments ban it: coz they can't tax people on stuff which is grown at home... <br>  <br>  So yeah I support Marijuana all the way!|`|zgugU4Gtaa	There is tons of info on web re the propaganda campaign <br>  Culprits include guy by the name of Ainslinger. William Randolph Hearst, Du Pont<br>  <br>  Many people believe that Mr. Anslinger collaborated with industry giants to outlaw marijuana.  It is known that he was acquainted with both the Hearsts (of Hearst Newspapers) and the DuPonts, of DuPont plastic fame.  (Hemp seed oil derivatives could replace DuPont's petroleum derived compounds.)<br>  <br>  In the 1930s, Hearst, who owned newspapers all over the country, started publishing sensationalist-type "news" stories about marijuana use. These stories, often written by Hearst or Anslinger himself, talked about "insanity, criminality, and death" caused by smoking marijuana, sometimes after just one joint. This intense propaganda campaign led to anti-marijuana laws in many states. <br>  <a href="http://www.heartbone.com/no_thugs/hja.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heartbone.com/no_thugs/hja.ht...</a><br>  <br>  and what would motivate the Du Ponts and other industries to throw their suppost behind propaganda campaign?<br>  <br>  Henry Ford's Hemp Car<br>  During the 1930's Henry Ford applied his ingenious mind to the creation of an all-organic car designed to run on hemp bio-mass fuel<br>  <a href="http://www.inya-face.com/hemp/08_Ford.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inya-face.com/hemp/08_Ford.ht...</a><br>  <br>   <br>  La Guardia Committee<br>  The La Guardia Committee was the first in depth study into the effects of smoking marijuana. It systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking marijuana results in insanity, deteriorates physical and mental health, assists in criminal behavior and juvenile deliquency, is physically addictive, and is a "gateway" drug to more dangerous drugs.<br>  <br>  The report was prepared by the New York Academy of Medicine, on behalf of a commission appointed in 1939 by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act . Released in 1944, the report infuriated Harry Anslinger who was campaigning against marijuana and he condemned it as unscientific. [1] Anslinger went on an offensive against what he saw as a "degenerate Hollywood" that was promoting marijuana use.<br>  <br>  After high profile arrests of actors like Robert Mitchum, Hollywood gave Anslinger full control over the script of any film that mentioned marijuana.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Commission" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_C...</a><br>  <br>  And of course there is D.A.R.E<br>  <a href="http://www.dare.com/home/DrugInformation/Storya78c.asp?N=DrugInformation&M=11&S=24" rel="nofollow">http://www.dare.com/home/DrugInformation...</a><br>  If you care to ...take a look at their Medical Marijuana fact sheet...it's a PDF.<br>  There are big black portions where they censored their own PDF.<br>  Got a big black marker and obscured some text.....<br>  <br>  Marijuana for personal use is the lowest priority of the Seattle Police Department.

Responsibly used in moderation, neither one is a concern.<br>  <br>  I take your point, certainly, and I'm inclined to agree that, generally speaking, the ill effects of marijuana are comparable or less than the ill effects of tobacco and alcohol.<br>  <br>  However, there are practical concerns regarding marijuana.  We lack the tools to determine present marijuana intoxication.  THC remains in your system for several days after the intoxicating effect has worn off, so that's not particularly probative.  This is a serious problem when we're talking about impaired driving, employees carrying out safety-sensitive tasks, etc.  If we say "marijuana use is okay; just don't do certain things when you're stoned", then how do we enforce it?  Have random police stops with chips and other munchies available, and see if the drivers can resist?|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Maybe, but it doesn't taste as good|`|7ef176ec08c7ea634fd04b5d033608fcaa	As with everything, there's only a problem when there is an excess. I like smoking the occasional doob, and by doing this I lead a very productive life. However, there's been times when I smoked all day everyday, and that's when the problems begin. But the same goes with alcohol, a few drinks every few weeks isn't an issue, it's getting smashed drunk all the time that causes problems.<br>  <br>  Weed vs alcohol: It's obvious that weed makes you docile, while alcohol usually pumps people up into some weird mood of doing some crazy stupid crap. I've done some BAD stuff while drunk that I'll never admit to anyone. But the worst thing I've ever done stoned is polish off a box of Twinkies. :-)

Self-defense is not considered a legitimate reason.<br>  <br>  The gun laws were tightened significantly in 1996, after the Port Arthur Massacre.

zLUQJxJkaa	Always point weapon is safe direction until ready to shoot.<br>  Always keep finger off of trigger until ready to shoot.<br>  <br>  When the person pulls that thing back, that's called the slide. What happens is there is no bullet aligned with the barrel. Pulling the slide back makes room for a bullet to come up and into the area where it's fired. When he fires, the slide goes back because of recoil and that chambers another round. But starting off he needs to either start with the slide back when he loads it, or pull the slide back to chamber a round.<br>  That click could be cocking a hammer (some pistols use hammers such as Sigs). Often the movies make the click to make it more exciting or whatever, it could also be him taking it off of the safety.

However it doesnt make sense because the slide locks back after the last round is fired so you just have to put in another magazine and push down on the slide release and your ready to shoot but movies dont portray things accurately.

EuGsGfuJaa	I am something of a self-defense enthusiast in my spare time and I've carried just about every kind of weapon except guns, so I can understand kind of where your coming from.<br>  <br>  I also know where to find laws though. Below is a link on NC weapon law, but I'll give a sum up here:<br>  -Folding knives are generally fine.  The law doesn't have a length limit, and a high court case ruled ones that a 4.5 inch blade is ok.  Just remeber:  Stab woulds don't put people done very fast.  I know, having been shanked and I still knocked my attacker out despite my wound.<br>  -Nunchuku...eh, they're not forbidden by name in the law, but police generally perceive them as "punk-***" weapons, frankly due to Hollywood notoriety.  It's possible, but not certain, that they could be considered a "deadly weapon of like kind."  An expandable baton is probably a better choice, as the police training system calls them "less lethal" and they are much easier to use effectively.  You don't see cops using Nunchuku, after all, do you?<br>  -Pepper spray is perfectly legal and people do NOT give this stuff enough credit. It WORKS.  And it's ranged and will never kill anyone, so you are less likely to "flinch" when you need to use it.  Just get a good brand, like Fox or DefTec.<br>  <br>  Thinks you CAN'T carry are double edged knives, bowie knives, brass knuckles, stun guns, blackjacks, or throwing stars.<br>  <br>  If you want more info on NC law and such, feel free to e-mail me.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	If your fists are not enough to protect yourself, take some martial arts classes such as Krav Maga (Israeli martial arts which is specific for each individual's strengths and weaknesses).

There are so many different people from all over the U.S. and the world, not everyone is going to get <br>  <br>  along with each other. We had people yelling at each other and never getting along. We didn't really even start to come together as a team <br>  <br>  until about week 6.<br>  <br>  One thing I really had a hard time getting use to was being bossed around and getting yelled at. I didn't take any of the yelling personally, <br>  <br>  because I know it is the job of the recruit division commanders to turn us from normal people into sailors, but still, being woken up each <br>  <br>  morning by yelling and having it continue throughout the day becomes stressful.<br>  <br>  With that said I would like to give some good hints on how to deal with Navy boot camp. ( although some of these will apply to Army, Air <br>  <br>  Force, and Marines ).<br>  <br>  1. Don't be sensitive<br>  Don't take things that are said to you personally while in boot camp, even if it's by another recruit. All that does is cause you more <br>  <br>  stress. If a recruit division commander (RDC) yells at you for something just respond with "aye aye petty officer/chief" or "yes petty <br>  <br>  officer/chief". If another recruit yells at you just ignore them. If they are trying to correct you just listen to them and correct yourself.<br>  <br>  2. Teamwork<br>  Learn to work as part of a team. In order for a team to form everyone has to be able to have an active roll. Don't separate yourself from the <br>  <br>  others and don't let others become isolated from the group. If you see someone that isn't quite part of the team then have them help you with <br>  <br>  whatever the current task is. Another part of this is never leaving a shipmate behind. If someone is having a hard time with folding or <br>  <br>  running or push up, or anything else, then help them! I had this guy next to me at boot camp that really sucked at folding his shirts and <br>  <br>  pants. Every night I would help him with folding and make sure everything in his rack locker was organized correctly.<br>  <br>  I believe the most common things people struggle with are swimming, running, folding, and making racks.<br>  <br>  3. Never give up<br>  If you give up you will never get anywhere. Just keep trying and seek help from your division (teamwork!). When you're doing the 20 minute <br>  <br>  run and you feel like you can't go anymore just keep trying. That only lasts for a little bit then you get more energy. Just slow your <br>  <br>  breathing down, and keep your current speed.<br>  <br>  4. Take advantage of Holiday Routine (Sunday)<br>  Every Sunday you get about 5 hours of free time. Take advantage of that. Take a break; write letters, go to church, get to know other people <br>  <br>  in your division. Letters were very important to me in boot camp. They are what kept me going. I made my dad write to me every day and I was <br>  <br>  able to respond every Sunday.<br>  <br>  5. Attention to details<br>  Pay attention to what you're doing. Do exactly what you're told, don't assume the RDCs mean for what they say to be interpreted a different <br>  <br>  way. This happened a lot in my division.<br>  <br>  6. Sleep when allowed<br>  When you're allowed to sleep actually take advantage of it, don't stay up talking to other people, you can talk at other times, use your <br>  <br>  sleeping time to regain your energy and rest. This will help A LOT.<br>  <br>  7. Eat healthy<br>  The galley's at boot camp offer a large variety of foods, make sure you eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. (The galley will have a salad <br>  <br>  bar in it too.) Balance you meals out make sure you have a little of everything. Here is what I did in boot camp.<br>  1 - meat<br>  1 - cup of milk (not before running or PT)<br>  2 - fruits (usually a peach and a banana)<br>  2 - vegetables (whatever they had as the main vegetables and a salad)<br>  2 - grains Usually a roll and one of the things in the main line.<br>  <br>  General knowledge to know before joining the navy<br>  <br>  Before you join the navy, or before you go to boot camp, it is a good idea to know some information so you will have a bit of a head start. <br>  <br>  This information is covered in the delayed entry pro|`|GGAgxzJNaa	I went through it 30 years ago in Orlando, but here's a good site that's up-to-date.

There are University Hospitals that will give you free health care if you need it and do not have insurance.

Do some research.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Probably. Michael J. Fox never uttered a word about Parkinsons until he was afflicted with it. Now  his primary focus is on the disease and fund raising for a cure.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	The custodial parent has a legal duty to ensure that the minor child complies with the lawful court order.  If you don't make the child go, the non-residential parent could go to court and claim that you are interfering with visitation.  You should know that the government of Florida could drag the teenager kicking and screaming to visit the other parent or they may even take him/her into custody or award custody to the other parent...so I suggest that you do not ignore the visitation order but get it set aside or varied!    <br>  <br>  Get a lawyer for the teenager and have them petition the court to modify the visitation order, but the court could decide that at age 14, the child should not be deprived of access to the other parent, that it isn't in the child's best interest, no matter what the child thinks.  They could even determine that child has been the victim of parental alienation so be very careful on how you handle this!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11280512	In joint custody matters possession is 9/10 of the law. In the event the nrp contacted the authorities (police) claiming their child was being withheld, the police or any other authorative body would advise the parent it is a custodial issue and it must be resolved through the courts. However, has visitation been court ordered? In the event it has the rp may want to contact the courts and inquire as to what rights the child has. With no order in place, there is nothing the nrp can do in the event the child does not wish to see them; other than filing for full custody.|`|2rcSILkWaa	The RP DOES have to tell the child to go.  If part of the custodial agreement says the parent gets child for a weekend, the child has to go, unless other arrangements are mutually agreed to.<br>  <br>  If the RP does not try to abide by order, the RP would be in violation of the agreement.  That parent would probably end up in front of a judge to explain their actions.|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Make sure that the child tells the NRP that they do not want to visit.

The parent trying to see the child, can call the pd about this but why take a kid who wants to hang with friends instead of visit a parent. The custodial parent, needs to do their job, which is, to parent and tell that child they will go visit. You sure wouldnt want that to be happening to you would you. So what they have their teenage plans. I really do not respect a parent that doesnt lift a finger to help the other parent get their visitation. Its a rule you get your child support, that parent also has a right to see their child, let the kid cry and make them go.

At age 14 the child should have their own voice in court...   <br>  <br>  Schedule a mediation hearing (usually takes a couple weeks rather than a couple months to get a hearing)  let the child tell his/her story to the mediator explaining why the scheduled visitation isn't working for them...  <br>  <br>  The mediator will help both parents and the child find a different schedule that works or give the child the right to decide for themselves with each visit whether to go or not...   Make sure the mediator stipulates a cancellation deadline for the teenager (I.E. you have to call and cancel the visit by 8:00p.m. the evening before pick-up or you are required to visit.) So the NRP isn't being told to go away at the door..<br>  <br>  In the meantime talk with the teen and explain they will have to visit unless they can give a valid safety reason why they shouldn't...  The RP is required to allow visitation but only if that visitation does not place the child in imminent physical danger...   If imminent physical danger is the issue a police report should already have been made and mediation or court date set...|`|eS9nPWqBaa	This is confusing.<br>  <br>  You said - teenager does not want to go<br>  <br>  Then - The residential parent has no intention of telling the child they have to go, nor provide access to the NRP to the home in order to get the child|`|IGXE3aDraa	see if you can get custody changed so the kid doesn't have to go. if you have an order that your ex can't go past your front stoop wouldn't they have already changed custody to protect the child as well.|`|7708f35ffa2cf7f984891812e17158beaa	The residential parent has the obligation to allow visitation, unless modified by a court order.

She was opposed to homosexuality although many of her friends were homosexual.

One of the reasons for the rising unemployment is a result of the uncertainty in the market because of this administrations failure to do anything but spend and promise to raise taxes and the angst of employers to release workers/staff because of the promise of higher taxes. No one who creates employment in the public sector is getting any positive vibes from this administration.

I've heard that the cops were recruits and the stimulus money has not yet reached their area. <br>  <br>  Any retention or creation of jobs is nice, but it probably takes 5 private sector jobs to pay for 1 public one. Obama should not focus on federal spending but on tax breaks to businesses that hire people.<br>  <br>  Unlike some of the other conservative leaning respondents here, I don't expect the economy to get better very fast. Those sorts of job losses are normal in a recession and we aren't even close to the unemployment under Great Depression. I just happen to think that massive government spending at this time will leave us worse off and will make recovery harder.

The Sons of Liberty were the radical revolutionaries of their time.  With conservatives, you get a Myanmar-style Junta replacing your institutions, and disarming the survivors.<br>  <br>  Anyway, your research is independently verified here.  And congrats on an intelligent question.  I am even giving you a star.<br>  <br>  But, for all of that, I don't have a problem with that particular bill.  I would really prefer that folk wearing tinfoil hats to prevent being controlled from rays from space not be permitted to own a gun.  At the same time, a thoughtful person should be able to arm himself with modern weaponry, though I would oppose mounting it on ordinary road vehicles.  (Even though the fellow who rode my bumper, flipped me off, and cut me off sending me in the wrong direction and costing me half an hour desperately deserves to have his SUV's tailfeathers tweaked with a contraterrene missile. ;-)<br>  <br>  Since your question shows some intellect, try this site.

I believe that would be the most dangerous act any President would attempt. <br>     Most people (if not All) who have firearms believe that for the Government to take them is an unforgivable act.<br>    This is not any other country in the world, I believe that the reason we have never been invaded by an actual army since the Revolution is due to the fact that so many Americans own and know how to use guns.  In a sense the American gun owner is as much of a deterrent to conventional warfare on American soil as the Military. <br>  <br>  B.T.W  would you want the job of trying to take the guns away from a Texan?

The requirement for licensing has been one that has been in my state for a long time. It simply means that a background check needs to be done on each individual that buys from a dealer or collector and makes it a crime to possess a firearm that was not purchased from a dealer. Nothing new here.|`|fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	Registration of guns does not deny your 2nd amendment rights to own a firearm.

The Taliban was created as a resistance to the Soviet Union, but Afghanistanis quickly realized that even communism was better than the Taliban.  Great Britain has never been involved in Afghanistan.  Furthermore, the United Soviet Socialist Republic fell in 1989, and Afghanistan was not a cause for their collapse.

The US dominated during the era when that industry was growing; today, that industry grows less, and global competition chips away at market share.  In contrast, WM sells products from global suppliers, and benefits from the declining labor costs as imports are made in countries with lower labor costs.<br>  <br>  The two companies aren't comparable, and their labor relations aren't comparable.<br>  <br>  Labor unions helped create the middle class in the auto industry -- there was no other way that wages would have risen to what they were.  If it weren't for these high wages, there wouldn't have been sufficient demand for companies like Wal Mart to exist.  (Note that in countries like China and Mexico, Wal Mart isn't for the poor majority -- their middle class, which is the professional class only, shop at Wal Mart.)|`|c68fab39f254edc16c9e7f3cb2dd4854aa	Obviously you have no clue about labor unions. It is always easier to point a finger then to understand the real problem.<br>  Labor unions have no voting rights in management decision making process. Paying someone living wage does not affect the profitability of a company. Creating a consumer base that can affords to live decently and buy products they make creates society with healthy and prosperous economy.<br>  I don't like when people who don't understand the priorities of a social entity, in this case United States. We are in the mass not because of labor cost but the greed and stupidity of unregulated and selfish few executives. I don't want to leave out the corrupt political machinery that the capitalism breeds.<br>  The best way to know something is to read not just the conservative radio hosts but listen to your heart and consciousness.|`|1ecf9891cb89ca30d1fc0c44c80a23e4aa	YES!!! Unions at on time were good for America. But in todays age there all about power and money. Not one concern for the worker. They don't realize that they are killing the tree that feeds them.|`|YcN07uFvaa	wal mart and HEB do not hire union employees and their workers earn more per hour and have better benefits than the competition, and both business are a success.|`|fse90FqNaa	Wal-Mart SUCKS!!!|`|vRIEz071aa	Most union drives are not about money to begin with , most of the problems are how people are treated in the work place. I worked for Wal-Mart for over two years and could tell you things that would not belive. We were forced to work a 24 hour shift for inventory once and could not leave till we were done. We were also given much more work than could be done in a shift so we would have to clock out and work on our break and that still did not give us enough time.  Enough about Wal-Mart how about working for a shop that has the women work in the front and men in the back the women are not allowed to talk or look up from there jobs while the men do not have these rules. You see these are just a small sample of my world with out a union so please befor you put down a labor union think about me the pearson that was told at one time she is just a women so shut up and get back to work because employees are just as easy to replace as cattle in a stock yard. This was said to me by the owner.

Honestly, your hypothetical is a ridiculous question. It ignores the very essence of the libertarian economic theory, which is not that organizations would be there to help the elderly or poor, but that if they were forced to take care of themselves they would find a way on their merits. If they can't take care of themselves, then I'm sorry but that's natural selection for you. Libertarianism is about not ignoring nature and reality, which doesn't care what peoples needs are, and needs will always infinitely outweigh resources.<br>  A quote from Ben Franklin seems appropriate "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it."|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Hey Ron Paul has never said he would cut social security for the elderly. This would be robbery. Remember these people have put into social security for many many years.

17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	You may be almost 60, but your nostalgic look backwards is missing all of the stuff you used to be afraid of.  In your lifetime, we had the Cold, Korean, Vietnam, and two Middle East Wars plus some smaller potatoes like Grenada, Lebanon, Nicaragua; we had elementary schoolkids, to include you, doing pointless duck and cover drills for when we got nuked; your life saw the post war problems of Harry Truman who integrated the military, the McCarthism during the Eisenhower years, and the assassination of John and later Bobby Kennedy; we had the riots and pain of the Civil Rights Movement and the GOP assuming the mantle of the racist party after President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Bill; we had the energy crisis of the Nixon admin, the pardon of Nixon by Ford, the banks running up the interest rate during Carter and keeping it there through Reagan, Iran-Contra and the first record deficit under Reagan, the GOP spending $55m of taxpayer's money in the Whitewater witch hunt to ruin the Clinton admin that yielded nothing, only to spend even more time and world prestige impeaching him for a personal matter, and then Dubya making the world less safe by ignoring the warning signs that we were about to be attacked, afterwhich he threw away the goodwill of most of the planet and spent trillions of dollars plus the lives of thousands of American servicemen and women on a pointless quagmire.  <br>  <br>  There never were any days of innocence and responsibility.  Since mankind first became the dominant species on this planet, we've changed little.  Only the technology to kill each other more efficiently--or, to heal ourselves of injury and disease--has changed.  <br>  <br>  With the election of a president who is dedicated to restoring the middle class and cleaning up the mess of the past eight years, why should you feel more despondent?  If anything, you should feel some hope for the future.  Unlike the last guy, polls show the current president at 60-68% approval, and polls show approval for Congress has improved.  Yes, we face difficult times, but unlike the lack of leadership during the Hoover and Bush '43 years we have a guy now who will spend our tax dollars rebuilding the country.  <br>  <br>  Our country is in rough shape, but Americans under good leadership will endure and advance.

People seem to forget that the wealthy serve an incredible purpose in society.  They take the hit on new technology and buy things at higher prices (paying for the R & D) and eventually they make it affordable for the rest of us.  They create businesses that allow people to have nice lives with health benefits, without taking on the responsibility of ownership and liability that a person has when they run a business by themselves.  <br>  <br>  The other thing that I don't think is mentioned enough is that when you take away any incentive for excellence, people stop trying to do excellent work.  If a person's best effort will never get them a promotion or any greater salary, why would they even try to do a better job?  Look at government workers who are guaranteed a job - do they do great work?  Of course not.  They can't get promoted and they can't get fired so they put in the minimum effort and take the maximum benefits and the taxpayer pays for it all.

zjpB2GARaa	Are you really an anarchist or are you a socialist pseudo-anarchist?  Anarchism does not mean the abolition of private property (quite the contrary).  In an anarchist society, free competition is expanded to all areas (including defense and other "public goods") and there is no criminal gang monopolizing any part of the economy (or granting out monopolies to its friends, often in the name of "anti-monopoly" or "anti-trust").  In backward Somalia (home to a few illiterate Muslims), this system was successful and that country saw its living standards drastically increase over 15 years or so while living standards in neighboring countries were stagnant or declining.  Somalia has been destabilized in the last few years thanks to the invasion by the UN (actually Ethiopia, but with support from many countries including the US) and the response of the local court businesses to form a cartel (the "Islamic Courts Union") to resist that invasion (and attack competition).  Were anarchism (specifically free market anarchism) to break out in the US in the coming years (possibly after a complete loss of confidence in both Democrats and Republicans), I would expect it to be successful and to be the beginning of a world revolution.<br>  <br>  The Democrats and Republicans are different in theory, but virtually identical in fact, due to the existence of a few "moderates" that control both parties, with the help of the media.  Therefore, Republicans get elected and abandon their principles on economic issues, but Democrats get elected and abandon their principles on social issues and foreign policy, so significant policies never change, no matter who Americans elect.|`|9298mlxoaa	Dems are for workers that know the meaning of a dollar.

What could Obama do to make the Dow go up or down?  Do you think he could get his Wall St. gang helpers, Bernanke, Paulson and Geithner to stop funneling trillions of taxpayer's dollars to the richest of the rich who aren't satisfied with ripping 99.9% of the human species off for the past 30 years and want to finish the job of breaking the U.S. working class?  Do you think he could get the Republicans in the House and Senate to stop trying to sabotage him, work with him and admit that Rush Limbaugh is an idiot, a nut and a fascist (I don't use that word lightly or incorrectly, like Rush does.  Please look it up if you've forgotten what it means.)?  Do you think he can make the U.S. citizens have faith in and invest in a government and an economic system that are still stealing from us through Wall St. bailouts and two wars for the rich?  Would Obama be allowed by the powers that be to tax the crap out of the rich and actually make the rich pay those taxes, bring the U.S. troops home, socialize U.S. health care, nationalize the banks (as opposed to privatizing the federal government)  etc.?  No true liberals with any good ideas are allowed anywhere near him.  President Obama is helpless under the thumb of the rich and is actually useful to them as a distraction and scapegoat while they continue to steal our money for their own ever growing wealth.  If they haven't trickled that money back to us over the past 30 (more like 60) years, they aren't about to start now.  The national and global economies will continue to crash until the average guy and gal get some money.  You have allot of nerve (of course: Republican = conservative = fascist) talking about deadbeats sucking on teats when the rich f***s at AIG are asking for, and getting, billions of our tax dollars every week.|`|AA10719402	I'm glad Obama doesn't subscribe to the Dow Jones being the end all indicator of the economy.<br>  <br>  After all, it's just a group of people making judgment calls on certain industries based on intuition, obscured data, and group think.<br>  <br>  If there is not enough demand for people to be productive, what then?|`|AA10199093	The Republican policies which I shamefully supported since Reagan cast our economy's demise long ago.  If McOldMan had won, I'm sure even more TARP money would have been funneled to pay the bonuses of banking cheats and by now the nationalization of banks would have taken place.  Somehow, Obama has fought off the Republican's shell game of socializing this country and yet the fully ignorant and blind still think he is the committer instead of the inheriter of these capitalist sins.  The time for some of the people being fooled all of the time is over my friend.  The stakes are too high for all of us to be blind, scared sheep.

Why do the stock markets keep falling every time he opens his mouth and passes some big fat pork bill?  Can't you see the markets don't trust him and don't like what he's doing?  If they thought he was doing something good that would fix this country, the markets would be going UP! <br>  Every president makes some mistakes, there's not one without some corruption.  But look at what obama has done, who he's put into his administration (almost all crooks!).  All his government wants is for people to have to count on them for "everything", and that's what it's coming down to.  We're no longer a free country, and i hope some day your eyes will be opened and see what he really is.  I feel sorry for everyone that feels the same way you do...Bush is not to blame for everything.  You just want the government to hand out everything you need and that's not "American".|`|LCqL6Z2laa	You're saying the markets do not drop Everytime Obama gives a speech or signs a new bill?<br>  <br>  I see no signs of Obama's 1 Trillion dollar Spending bill having any positive impact what so ever.<br>  <br>  How many times is Obama going to bail out failing companies, only to finally realize that it is best to let them fail?

How long will you blame the previous administration for what Obama is failing to do?  Are we going to hear four years of this cr*p?

Well I know a great deal about Obama.. I have researched his past, his morals, his plan for america and the people he associates himself with. The men he employed in his administration are about as evil as they come. He surrounded himself with some of the most corrupt politicians in the US Government, he follows in the exact same footsteps as little Bush and he continues to turn America into a police state. What you need to realize is that it's all just smoke and mirrors to keep people distracted from the truth. It's true the economy was drowning before Obama but he is just trying to make things worse. He is doing what hes told to do, if Obama weren't in the picture then it would just be someone else doing the dirty work. You fail to understand that these people are mere puppets. They are all just spokesman. They all have an agenda and they all work towards it whether you notice the agenda or not. This isn't about who's a republicrat or not, its about the key goals they all have and who is going to do what they need to be done. Its all about excuses. You can't just say.. I want to Invade Iraq for its oil, to establish a permanent base in the middle east, and kill a few hundred thousand people. Nooo they needed 9/11. They cant just say I want to buy up and control every company thats worth any real value with a fiat currency I can print all I want, and then when things get really bad then I want to create an all new currency for the North American Union called the Amero.. nooo they needed the current economic crisis in order to do that. Smoke and mirrors... Nothing happens by accident, this is all happening for a reason. When you educate yourself on their agenda and what these New World Order puppets really want, then you will understand why the world is the way it is.

You're right, idiots defending the indefensible are entertaining.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, ratings lead people to believe that listeners agree.<br>  <br>  Do you buy the products advertised on Rush's show?

At least that would be a statement.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	It's interesting how so many people cry when talking about Obama. <br>  <br>  The people claim they are tears of joy, but in reality it is likely their subconscious telling them that Obama's moronic proposals will soon make everyone cry.....and they won't be able to continue to delude themselves into thinking that they are tears of joy.<br>  <br>  NoBama 2012. <br>  <br>  Keep up the good work Rush.

Rush limbaugh has anywhere between twenty and thirty million listeners each day.  That represents less than ten percent of the population.  How can anyone base an opinion on Rush when they have never actually heard him speak.  The fact that an individual could actually make a judgment without hearing the evidence, is what's absurd!<br>  <br>    I doubt you actually listen to Rush.  If you did actually listen, you would know that the real humor is in listening to liberals making the idiotic statements, and other liberals trying to defend idiotic statements with even more idiocy.  You would also know that the only thing I here Rush actually defend everyday is the Constitution.<br>  <br>       Is that the source of your actual disagreement?|`|827t379Laa	most people under thirty are dem/lib. that is not new. and to listen to opposing views is to be more informed. and to listen is not to agree, it is to get information.as far as his being a "comedy" show for left wingers, i doubt it. many heads would explode if that were true. and i would not think they would want to support him or his salary, for that matter.|`|LZw4JntHaa	Actually, according to a real poll, Rush's overall positive rating is over forty per cent.

They were given too much and did not have to toil the way so many older Americans have.  They are stupid and lazy.  <br>  <br>  We have raised a generation of fools and we can only hope that they gain wisdom as they age.  <br>  <br>  Rush is a very smart and articulate man.  Many of the millions who listen to him agree with him.<br>  <br>  I'm glad that you enjoy listening to conservative shows.  I tried listening to Air America a few times but found the crude and vile comments offensive.  I was hoping for clear articulation of the liberal point of view but instead the talk show hosts were juvenile, crude, hateful.  I just don't get it?  Are there any liberal talk shows where well-educated hosts discuss issues and and have respectful debates with those who disagree?  I was not surprised that Air America tanked but is that the best the liberals can do?|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Maybe you should try listening instead of following Dem talking points.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Point well taken. That said, how much money does he make and how much do you make? Rush ( or any other entertainer) doesn't really care if you like him or not. He just cares that the show is successful and the money keeps rolling in. That's all that matters. There's no such thing as bad publicity, even if it is negative. The more he is attacked by these idiots, the more successful he becomes. Whatever his show's ratings were before, i'm sure they are higher now.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Your mother has the right to refuse permission for you to attend university but she has to have a good reason for her refusal.  In other words, if she is doing it for reasons that are not in your best interest, you can probably get a judge to over-rule her.  I suggest that you have a chat with your local legal-aid office and see what you can do to emancipate yourself, or if you can't do that, possibly get yourself into the foster care program, based on her emotional abuse.  Yes, I know that foster care isn't very nice but the courts are most likely willing to allow you to attend university.  Anyway, get some legal advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11206283	IN general:<br>  <br>  First you need to live in a state that permits emancipation; not all do.

85932f18f518634b869005ec7eb29e14aa	We will find out that higher taxes on those who make over $250K is a very short-sighted move. Our biggest problem is that despite living in a country known for individual freedom, our politicians have managed to create class warfare for their own benefit.<br>  <br>  If everyone made the same and needed the same things, we would need a lot less government. Right now that seems to be the goal.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid, I looked up to those who worked hard to become successful. Now I see those people being demonized every single day of the week by the President of the United States and other government officials everywhere. If they were not all such hypocrites, it would be funny. Trust me...it is not funny.|`|m1T2fSnHaa	I was thinking about this, I bet one of them just quit their job- why give the govt 80k of your money ?

If my house was in California it would be about a million dollars, where I live its only worth 160k.  They make only a fraction more in income though- so it will be tough for them to pay their mortgage after the tax hike.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	I don't wish to work that hard.

I don't live in a city, and I'd rather eat my own waste than live in one. Housing prices aren't even back down to the historical mean, as adjusted for inflation, of around $100k. We out-grew our own incomes for a long time. The economy is nowhere near as bad as it seems...yet. I assure you, it will be. Our economy is being put into a controlled demolition, and it's being done on purpose. No one could screw it up this bad by accident.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	People were eagerly trying to make more and more money when the top tax rates were 90% under Eisenhower.

Trying to link a slight tax hike to individual ambition is absurd.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Do you know how a marginal-progressive tax system works?<br>  <br>  They only get higher taxes on income earned OVER 250K.  The money taxed up to that amount is taxed just the same as anyone else.<br>  <br>  This ensures the motivation to earn as much as you can because you aren't taxed at an income diminishing rate.<br>  <br>  Do you play the lottery?

I guess you are independently wealthy?|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Their taxes aren't even that much. A friend of the family is a consultant who makes well over that amount and he doesn't even notice his taxes. He bought a new Benz this year and made an addition on his HUGE home. He forgets to put his paychecks in the bank! He ain't worried about money, trust me. He'll do just fine paying the same taxes he did ten years ago.|`|0AsL26sSaa	You know, my father makes more than $250 K a year, but he deserves it. He has been working practically since he could walk. And then you have a "president" come along and tax him for that, just because he makes more than the average american. Where is the logic in that?|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Funny, because this is exactly the same thing that a lot of welfare people say.

Under the plan, anything you earn beyond $250K will not effect the tax rate on the first $250K, just what you make beyond it.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Tell you what, you quit your job and I'll take it.

Making those ACTUALLY responsible (which YES is the people who SIGNED documents saying THEY would pay for something, and are now NOT) pay up is not a "populist" thing to do.  The "people" would be upset because it's just government "giving to the rich" again.  Our country no longer knows morals and shame anymore, it's take take take anything you can get.  A handout is no longer respected and appreciated, it's expected and cried out for.  <br>  <br>  And "both ways" Barney was one of the Ringleaders himself... this is just another example of how politics:  the whistleblowers are the criminals.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	If you purchase something you cannot afford it is YOUR FAULT!|`|BovpXrk1aa	never going to to see the corruption these people have created|`|lRmhwiYpaa	The Post office purchased homes for some of their employees <br>  <br>  when they transfer./and they just bought a 1.2 million dollar mansion<br>  <br>  but the post office purchases thousands of homes for their empolyees.<br>  <br>  I said this as an example of government gone wild in spending<br>  <br>  The Postmaster General gets $850,000.00 a year salary ~twice what<br>  the preisident makes~~do you know think this is the reason the<br>  post office can't make any money and is going to be privatized?|`|dJnRFpWWaa	I have no idea about the time frame, but I suspect that as banks and mortgage companies identify those borrowers who failed to pay their mortgages you will see a pattern that connects certain loan officers to clusters of failed loans. You may also see a pattern of financial kickbacks to these loan officers over and above the very hefty commissions they were earning from making these loans.<br>  <br>  If I was a prosecutor, then I would investigate those loan recipients and determine who else knew they were making material misrepresentations on their mortgage applications. Where it's clear that the loan officers knew that the loan application was fraudulent, and the other point about liars loans was to give loan officers plausible deniability in this respect, I would offer them a deal. Plead guilty and testify against the loan officer and you avoid jail time. <br>  <br>  Then I would focus on convicting as many loan officers, realtors and real estate appraisers as possible and making them serve time and lose their professional licenses permanently.<br>  <br>  If you simply follow the money, you'll soon see who profited most and who therefore contributed most to this mortgage loan debacle. It may disappoint you to see the results, but all those bogus borrowers could not have gotten mortgages unless many other professionals were involved in making extensive mortgage fraud possible in the first place.|`|9HRkwzruaa	I totally agree with you.<br>  <br>  I also find it ironic (and amusing) that he wants to go after "those responsible", since he's on file as refusing to put restrictions and checks on the system when he had a chance and was repeatedly warned.  "I don't see any problems" arising with Fannie or Freddie and their subprime loans...wonder if he sees them now?|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	I was going to ask the same thing myself. When Obama's minions were grilling the bank CEO'S of where the money was being spent, Barney Frank himself actually had the gall to open his mouth. This was the guy that said Fannie and Freddie were fine before the mortgage crisis!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4A0RuXhnQA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4A0RuXhn...</a>|`|4bqm1zTCaa	That is so far fetched it broke when stretched out, lol. Most people have to provide PROOF of there income to get a loan. Why not blame the people that actually give out the loans. Those are the ones at fault FIRST !!!
BImIMnbzaa	Wrong !  1982 was not nearly as bad as today's economy, although it was bad.  This compares in many ways to the great depression.<br>  <br>  The reality for most people is whether they still have a job.  If you're still employed, this is a bad recession!  If you're un-employed, it is a depression !|`|KuWLNfYbaa	The 80,s were nothing,people emerged from the eighties much richer with houses worth 300% more by 1988 than in 1982.With this depression people will be lucky to emerge with a roof over their heads|`|AA11702773	Because he needs a crises to get people to let him shove his agenda down their throats.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	During the great depression, there was like 20% or higher unemployment and the stock market totally crashed. In order for that to happen again, all 30 Dow Jones stocks would have to fail, all of them, not just one. That list of 30 includes microsoft, at&t,coke, and wallmart. So therefore Obama making a statement like that just show his ignorance.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	Maybe he doesn't know that. Just like he didn't know that MANY prominent American economists DO in fact disagree STRONGLY with his plan to stimulate the economy. He ignores inconvenient facts. <br>  <br>  But a more likely answer would be that comparing today to the Great Depression packs much more of an emotional wallop than comparing it to 1982. I don't remember that much about '82, except that I was in law school. So I didn't see the light of day.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	Because with him at the helm we are headed for the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	The economy under Jimmy Carter was just as bad.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Because it's the worst since the depression which was worse than 82.<br>  <br>  82 bounced back quickly, the great one did not.<br>  <br>  This is not only a depression it's a sign of the times, of all that is wrong with society.<br>  <br>  It's so much more than just a depression it's a time of redefinition and the sooner people get that and go with the flow the sooner it will bounce back to some sense of normalcy, albeit a new normalcy.<br>  <br>  It will never be as it was and can't because it just was a sham and a scam.  <br>  <br>  Time to get serious. These are serious times.|`|AA11694451	To begin with Obama has no clue of what he talks about or for that matter, is doing. He reads his cue cards and teleprompters when speaking relying on the idea that what he is reading is true. His handlers spoon feed him this sort of BS because it pushes their current agenda. The insiders (those involved in the new world order) don't want Americans to remember that capitalism brought us out of the last recession. Instead they want us to falsely believe that FDR's socialism is the reason the great depression was overcome so that they can push further socialist agendas on Americans and hope we don't figure it out. The truth is that WWII was the biggest factor in getting the US out of the depression, and FDR's policies were a contributing factor in the depression's continuation.<br>  <br>  The insiders want americans beholden to government. The easiest way to do this is through economic slavery (socialism). It worked in Europe why not continue it in the states. It is all smoke and mirrors, and Americans are falling for it.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	where do you get your facts ? were you even around in the depression ? 1982 was bad, but not to bad....

Also, it is the worst if you look at the fact that it all started with Clinton.  Now Bush gets all the blame. Here's what is real.  The Dems were in power for 2 years under Bush.  Do you really think that Bush did this or is it the Dems.  Let's see.   HMMMMM.. ... Obama has to get votes from where? Oh Yea, the house. Looks to me like the problem is not in the white house but rather in the legislative house.  They are going to ruin the economy for sure.  You can't buy your way out of a recession you can only do that by tax cuts, immediately.  This puts money in everyones hands now and true to form, we'll spend it.|`|hXwqKidraa	Obama wants to create fear, confusion, and promote general chaos.

He ignored warning from the CBO that said the pork-bill will do more harm than good and pushed it through anyhow.  Any businessman to take that approach would be fired and/or out of business w/in the year.<br>  <br>  I don't doubt he'll create thousands of jobs but they'll be of a linear fashion, that is to say they'll be around for as long as the project requires them and then they're back on the street looking for work.<br>  <br>  Deficit-financed spending is supposed to instigate an economic shock w/in the first 4 quarters and then slow to a simmer after that.

But this debate will never happen; Obama would be humiliated and probably lose some of his credibility among the people, and it would give people more reason to hate Limbaugh.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Obama has a plan for this nation.  He's always had a vision.  First though, he has to clean up the apocalypse that Bush created.  But here are some of his proposals:<br>  <br>  1. Tax cuts for 95% of the working class<br>  <br>  2. Getting everyone on health care--he plans to improve it to the kind that he and Congress uses<br>  <br>  3. Giving increased financial aid to colleges along with fixing education in all grades below that.<br>  <br>  4. Getting us out of the war in Iraq<br>  <br>  5. Tax cuts on corporations THAT SEND JOBS OVERSEAS NOT ALL CORPORATIONS.  Therefore jobs here will increase.<br>  <br>  6. Increase creation of green jobs.<br>  <br>  Here's what Rush proposes:<br>  <br>  1. Tax cuts to the rich (Obama's cutting taxes for the middle class and he's complaining)<br>  <br>  2. Wants to give vouchers to "good" students so that they escape the "bad" schools.  The problem with this is 1. The students who are left behind. 2. The fact that when everyone gets on it, the Republicans will cry that they are throwing away money on people who haven't worked for it (ex: welfare) and then it will be eliminated.  The government will then end its' financing of kids going to school past elementary.  Read what Milton Friedman said about the masses.<br>  <br>  3. More tax cuts for the top corporations.  <br>  <br>  Obama has beaten McCain and Hillary, I don't think Rush will be any competition.  Rush is spouting more of the same lies the Republicans have told for years and everyone can see through him.  Obama knows all the right words to use and puts compassion in his speeches.  Rush has alienated non-Conservative women, feminists, liberals, independents, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians, and some Republicans.  The only people who support him are die-hard conservatives who make up 14% of the population...not even most Republicans as you can see by Micheal Steele's argument with him.  As for Obama, the vast majority of people: liberals, Republicans, Democrats, independents, most women, many men, blacks, whites, Indians, Asians, and Hispanics have agreed that he is genuine due to his upbringing, his loss of a father, loss of a grandmother, his struggle with identity in school--all of which allows him to connect with people on a personal level.  Rush is only concerned about himself and it shows in his blustering talks.  He is mocking, cruel, blunt and self centered.  The vast majority is turned off by him while they are not only impressed with Obama (even when he doesn't use a telepromter) they know that he will attempt to change America to fit the ancient vision of America as a melting pot.  He is in a family of women, raised by women, he has a connection to blacks and Hispanics due to his being half black, he has a connection to the poor because he was raised by a single mother and grandmother who were not well off and he has a tie to whites due to his grandmother, grandfather and mother who are white and he is half white, he has a tie to the Christian church due to his work there, he has a tie to the communities due to his organizing there--so they know he's legit.<br>  <br>  Rush has done nothing but talk.  Sports players give their time and their money to kids, charities, etc.  What has Rush done?  Obama gave up his chance to make money to help his community.  He turned his back on his self interests by working to help others.  My opinion?  Obama by a landslide...|`|cIIR0fEgaa	Rush would win as he says "with one hand tied behind his back just to make it even".   Rush doesn't need the teleprompter he is well informed.

Now, Obama may eventually get Congress, who spends the money, to propose a Constitutional change to allow him to spend money but until then, it is Congress who authorizes and spends money, not the President.  What Bush did was to not veto pork spending bills which is why most Republicans were disappointed in him.  However, the Congressional control changed two years before his term ended from Republican to Democrat.  After the Democrats took control, the spending increased dramatically and has continued to climb out of control since Obama's election because there is no veto threat any longer.

Making Fannie Mae into a pseudo private/public company to get its balance sheet directly off the federal budget (since the days of Lyndon Johnson) set the ball in motion for an accumulation of debt and false wealth that was years in the making.  Now, government is trying to stop the natural fall that needs to occur in the housing market by spending more money in an attempt to prop up homeowners and other government-favored businesses which will only serve to fuel hyperinflation and further increase our country's indebtedness.

O5DZvc0Xaa	I am very concerned that the threat of "cyber-terror" will be used as an excuse to censor the free exchange of information on the web.<br>  <br>  I started talking about this over a year ago. Quoting from my weblog:<br>  <br>  "...in order to justify the revolutionary changes they have in store for the internet, the media/telecomms consolidation gods will declare a “War on Cyber-Terror” in which the user is the enemy. They will claim that measures must be taken to keep us all safe online, and protect critical databases and infrastructures from the “ever increasing threat” of “cyber-attacks.” Unfortunately, the changes made will have nothing to do with security, and everything to do with deciding for you (end-user) exactly how you are to be allowed to use your own technology."<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  "Since the mechanisms of internet (and computers in general) are only understood by such a small percentage of people, it will be incredibly easy to mislead the masses on this issue — probably even easier than it was to convince them to believe in a “War on Drugs” and a “War on Terror,”"<br>  ...<br>  <br>  "...a string of cyber-attacks on high-profile military and government targets would be used to justify the fundamental changes that certain powers want to make in regards to how the internet works. We are starting to see this happen, but as we move forward, it is important for everyone to understand that these attacks do not have to be staged, like little Gulf of Tonkins. As any security consultant can tell you, the frequency of attempts to compromise any system with an internet footprint is incredible, and high-profile targets are no exception. The very minute that a computer is connected to the internet, it is under seige. So, if the Pentagon (for example) really wanted to be attacked, all they would have to do is let down their countermeasures for one moment. They could even have the luxury of choosing exactly which component or node of their intranet is to be compromised — to ensure a perceived threat but not a real one."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This dovetails, of course, with the recent headline hype about the Iranian hackers allegedly using the internet to steal the plans for Marine One (the president's helicopter). <br>  <br>  If this is even true, it's because someone on our end screwed up and left the information online-accessible and not properly secured. It isn't the internet's fault. It's yet another question of: "are they just stupid, or did they do this on purpose?"<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be, instead of bringing in a new internet protocol, we all just secure our own machines, as the first answerer said. If the telecoms gods get their way, we won't even have the right to do that anymore. Instead, a handful of corporations and government/corporate entities will be responsible for everyone else's information security, thereby consolidating the more data in fewer places, creating targets of opportunity for real hackers (who WILL be pissed off by this point in time) and only exacerbating the potential threat.|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	We shouldn't be too terribly concerned as long as we are securing our own computers against intrusion...like I do.<br>  <br>  However, Mr. Beckstrom's stated reason for resigning is most likely not the *real* reason he resigned.

Lincoln’s democratic vision of a government “of the people, by the people, for the people” has long since degenerated into rule of, by, and for the rich. The right to vote means little in a political process regimented by an institutionalized bipartisan “two-party” system that guarantees the monopolization of election campaigns by the two corporate-backed political parties. The existing electoral set-up excludes effective participation by parties opposed to the Democrats and Republicans. Ballot access laws have been designed to prevent challenges to the two-party dictatorship. Likewise, freedom of the press means little when the major media outlets are controlled by powerful corporate interests. Moreover, there are many indications that the Internet, which has created the possibility for alternative opinions to be heard, will be subjected to increasingly heavy-handed regulation.<br>  The defense of democratic rights is inseparably bound up with the struggle for socialism. As there can be no socialism without democracy, there will be no democracy without socialism. Political equality is impossible without economic equality. Like the struggle against war, the fight to defend and expand democratic rights requires the independent political mobilization of the working class, on the basis of a socialist program, to conquer state power.<br>  The establishment of workers’ power requires far more than the election of socialist candidates to the existing institutions of the bourgeois state. New forms and structures of genuine participatory democracy – arising in the course of revolutionary mass struggles and representative of the working class majority of the population – must be developed as the foundations of a workers’ government; that is, a government of the workers, for the workers, and by the workers. The policy of such a government, as it introduces those measures essential for the socialist transformation of economic life, would be to encourage and actively promote a vast expansion of democratic working class participation in, and control over, decision-making processes. It would favor the abolition of existing institutions that either curtail democratic processes or serve as centers of conspiracy against the people (such as the imperial Presidency, standing army, and national-security apparatus). These and other necessary changes of a profoundly democratic character, to be determined by the masses themselves, are possible only in the context of the mass mobilization of the working class, imbued with socialist consciousness.<br>  The struggle for power requires the unconditional political independence of the working class from the parties, political representatives and agents of the capitalist class. The working class cannot come to power, let alone implement a socialist program, if its hands are tied by politically enfeebling compromises with the political representatives of other class interests. First and foremost, this means unwavering rejection of the timeworn and fraudulent myth that the Democratic Party represents, as compared to the Republican Party, a “lesser evil.” The subordination of the working class to this reactionary capitalist party – which traces its lineage to the slave-owning class in the pre-Civil War era – has been, historically, the Achilles heel of the labor movement in the United States. Despite its tradition of violent class conflict and industrial militancy, the labor movement’s dependence upon the Democratic Party – promoted for decades by the trade union bureaucracy, the Stalinists of the Communist Party, and innumerable middle-class political tendencies – effectively blocked the development of an independent and politically class conscious movement of the working class, fighting for its own class program, under its own banner. Among the paramount political responsibilities of the Socialist Equality Party is to advocate, encourage and promote a decisive and irrevocable break by the working class with the Democratic Party and the whole two-party system.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/prin-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...</a>|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	No I doubt that.

That is why the Constitution limits government. - To prevent tyranny. <br>  Socialist would rather behave irresponsibly and let all of society pay out the nose to correct for their screw-ups. They over regulate everything rather than hold responsible (and liable) those causing the problems.  <br>  Socialists want tyranny. They just use subterfuge and specious arguments to disguise that fact.|`|39KUKALFaa	Public officials at the top of the party will be freer to oppress people.<br>  <br>  This is socialism:-<br>  <br>  The Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, Ministry of State Security, was the primary intelligence and security agency of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), or East Germany, during the Cold War. The Stasi, as the organization was most commonly known, maintained a comprehensive network of informants, agents, and military-trained secret police. Stasi operations focused on political security and espionage, both domestically and abroad, aiding the Soviet KGB more than any other satellite intelligence organization. During its 39-year tenure, at least one-third of the population of East Germany was victimized by Stasi surveillance, arrest, detention, or torture.|`|T3AYLMg3aa	Looking at the fact that we have 700 military bases in 130 countries I say the military will need first to look at, Freedom is not policing the world?

T3AYLMg3aa	This is where the people have failed them selves. The government was never suppose to help companies. It was not suppose to help Chrysler when it did and it was never suppose to help any bank. This is the reason the people have the right to over throw this government. The government was to take care of government afares not corporate afares. Because of what the government did, it over stepped it's true duty and has cost the people trillions for decades to come. The people must act or the same will happen again. That is why you must write to your congress people so they know how the people feel. Also the Military has become so big that it supply's to many jobs to the people that have to be paid by the tax payer. They should demand proof of where the president was born too. Our for fathers did not mean a "natural born citizen" as being born in Kenya. Write and demand that the gag order on his birth certificate be removed so the people will know the truth.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	See the lost decade of Japan we are following their model
JafmNha5aa	I don't, but when you consider this question, you have to remember that both parties have tried it, so it can't be blamed on one party. A lot of people talk about "Bush's bailout" or "Obama's bailout" but the fact is that both parties stupidly tried it. digging a hole deeper doesn't remove the hole.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	Nancy, Harry, Barney, Chris, Chuck, and Barrack = 6<br>  <br>  I count 6 people think the bailout have helped the economy|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Helped it do what?|`|RuUUPWYUaa	The Bailouts provided by both the Bush and Obama Administration have generated an effort to prolong longevity for workers across America. The Stimulus Package under the Obama Administration already is ushering jobs on the local sector in various cities across America regarding Police, Teachers and Infrastructure positions. President Obama was frank in indicating that our economic situation, didn't happen overnight and quick overnight solutions are not realistic. I would further examine those who are unemployed, and have benefited by having their unemployment benefits extended. Something is always better than nothing.|`|82f504f48b6acb65555ae26d546043e9aa	No, I only see more of the people around me losing their jobs.  More everyday.  There shouldn't have been any bail outs at all.  Companies fail and new ones take their place.  I don't feel the government should be helping those who bought homes they knew they couldn't afford, those who used the value of their homes to remorgage the house and buy a big screen tvs.  Those quote greedy home owners need to lose it all, just the big companies should have been allowed to do.<br>  Handing money to people who obviously do not know how to handle it is as crazy as expecting King Obama to fix all of their problems.|`|56128eff22a11b70b0011e2498880ba3aa	No it won't help, in fact other then a very short term burst of activity, it'll draw out the recovery and increase inflation.|`|PPrGDCCiaa	We don't know if the bailouts have helped or not, nothing happens over night, give it 6 months, then ask this question again.|`|T3AYLMg3aa	Only the ones that do not care.
OlCr3iNFaa	As for the previous poster.  I have met way more than 10 people on welfare.  WAY more!   <br>  Most of them make me ill.  The laziness, the sense of entitlement, the abuse of free resources, the attitude all irritated the ****out of me!<br>  I worked as a minimum wage slave, (and even less than minimum wage at times) to eke out a living and feed my children.  It sickened me to see the welfare people sending out for pizza and demanding free stuff from social services.   They all had a HIGHER standard of living than I did working my butt off.<br>  I could have gone on welfare too, and lived on easy street and handouts.   But I could never be a BUM!<br>  I went back to school (at a huge personal cost) and now make a ton more than I did.  The welfare people I knew then are still on welfare, multi-generational welfare!!!!!|`|f6e4526698ad112fa58d2badd73e2e1aaa	so he can keep voters like this one<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWaCsdYSlI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWaCsdYS...</a><br>  <br>  It will be interesting to see how they react when they don't get as big as a free ride as they expected|`|R5RHMIYQaa	That is good, the system which was created in 1996 did not work, it does not allow for single mothers to go to college and get an education.  The bill which was passed in the 90's was much more of a form of punishing the poor, I am glad to hear that now I might have a chance to get on my feet for me and my family.  How about punishing dead beat dads instead of moms who are trying there hardest to make it.  Single parents should not have been punished for being single to begin with.  It is not our fault that we are single, we are not the ones who left the relationship and abandoned our family.  I am happy to hear that our president has some family values and that he is going to make it possible for people like me to make it.  The welfare system is not what needs to be reformed anyhow, no one wants to be on welfare!  What needs to be reformed is our social security system.  The government needs to create some type of a test as to what qualifies one to recieve an SSI check!  My neighbor for example, who has popped out 5 children and gets disability for her hips, she could only collect a check for the first 3 children, so she married a man who also recieves disability, and he claims the other 2 kids.  Or, perhaps my other neighbor who has 3 children, and gets disability for her psychological problems.  I admit, she has psychological problems, but, perhaps, if someone is psychologically disabled, they should have to perform a parental fit test prior to being allowed to raise children.  People like me who are working and trying to make it, who qualify for nothing more than a minimum wage job should not be punished.  Further more, child support needs to get their act together and find my daughters father, well, they have found him twice, but he keeps disappearing before they get a chance to take him to court to get a court order for him to pay child support.  Perhaps its about time we create some laws regarding matters such as these.  Perhaps we should create work camps for dead beat dads!  In the mean time, my bosses wife, who has worked for 20 years has a legitimate disability, and she has been denied 2 times.  Perhaps we should investigate doctors who over and over again  diagnose young capable people as being disabled, perhaps they should be held liable!  Apparently, my bosses wife does not have the right connections as my neighbor with 5 children blatently bragged that she so does.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I don't know but I suggest you go out & meet 10 people who are on welfare. With all thy getting, get understanding. If after spending time getting to know 10 people you still have this question than come back & explain why it shouldn't be in there I imagine you will end up being thankful for your health, your mind, your finances, your family & so much more you will be thankful to have this money go to these people.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	wel already have third generation welfare families - why not make it even more -- THIS IS PATHETIC!

Yes, having a bad attitude can affect the work space, but overall the economy is not failing because of how people act.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	It would make going to work better but you likely would work less.  But see if you can sell Obama on the idea, I think it would do less harm than any of his ideas so far.<br>  <br>  Nice try Solar..  Hoover/Obama is more like it.  Roosevelt was bad enough but he was not as bad as Obama.  Roosevelt used the government to create private sector jobs not public sector jobs.  Theirs a big difference. During the depression they called NYC central Park Hooverville because all the homeless people lived there.  Where will the first ObamaVille be?|`|JCxE0mq9aa	This is what Barack Obama doing.

All the sin taxes target the lazy anyway.  If they didn't waste public funds, they would just raise my taxes, again.|`|Bu4XeFVPaa	I did two years ago, it isn't a cake walk.  <br>  <br>  I know this will be unpopular on answers but I don't think that it is fair to tax the hell out of smokers with out offering them assistance to quit, like the drug chantix which really works.|`|DQkDQraOaa	In the present economy, yes, I believe more people will be quitting due to the price of cigarettes. Some may try buying bulk tobacco and rolling their own, but it won't be the same.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	That's just another way Socialists use to control the population. <br>  Just like Obama's plan to tax coal until no one can afford to get their energy from a coal fired power plant.|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	they seem to tax the hell out of ciggs, but not beer.

Most of that naive 49% could not tell you the FIRST THING about Ronald Reagan.  In fact, most of that 49% could not name the 9 Supreme Court Justices! <br>  I provided the link to the actual poll PDF since you were to lazy to do any research, and the numbers spoke for themselves: 361 Democrats, 197 Independents, 285 Republicans.  NICE TRY!<br>  <br>  Polling was conducted by telephone March 3-4, 2009, in the evenings.<br>  The total sample is 900 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.

I thought it was the media that hand picked him.  But then, if the media were as left leaning as many believe they would have picked Cynthia McKinney who served longer in Congress than Obama, also served as a state senator (from Georgia) and who is far to the left of Obama.  <br>  <br>  But back to your question.  Such a poll is rather premature.  Obama hasn't been in office long enough to make a comparison.  It is comparing someone who has just started with someone who has finished the job and is credited with getting us out of the last recession.  <br>  <br>  Most folks compare Obama to Bush II, not Reagan, though most of us hope he will be as successful in reversing the economic slide as Reagan was.  <br>  <br>  I think most of us also know that it is too easy to play with the statistics.  You can compare the deficit using gross dollar amounts, percent of the GNP, dollars adjusted for inflation, and any of many other stats to make whatever case you want. <br>  <br>  In 2012 the question most people will be asking themselves is the one Reagan asked in 1980, "are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?"  Most people won't try to figure out if any improvement was due to Obama getting his way or The GOP preventing him from doing what he wanted or factors beyond the control of The President or Congress.  You can be fairly sure both sides will take credit for the successes and blame the other for the failures, and that most people will believe what the side they like says.|`|VP1yQRwNaa	How many people that took that poll were not even alive back then?

AA10057370	Surgical Abortions<br>  See also: Chemical Abortions ? Abortifacient Contraceptives<br>  <br>  (click on small thumbnails for larger photos) <br>  <br>  There are many methods of abortion. The procedure used depends largely upon the stage of pregnancy and the size of the unborn child. Dr. J.C. Willke, in his book, Abortion: Questions and Answers (Hayes Publishing Co. Inc, Cincinnati, 1985), has divided the methods of abortion into three main categories: those that invade the uterus and kill the child by instruments which enter the uterus through the cervix; those that kill the preborn child by administration of drugs and then induce labour and the delivery of a dead baby; and, those that invade the uterus by abdominal surgery.<br>  <br>  Dilation of the uterus is required in cervical methods of abortion. The usual method of dilation is to insert a series of instruments of increasing size into the cervix. A set of dilators, metallic curved instruments, are used to open the cervix sufficiently to accommodate the instruments of abortion. In contrast with a normal birth, where the dilation occurs slowly over a period of many hours, the forceful stretching by the abortionist to open the cervix takes a matter of seconds. This premature and unnatural stretching of the cervix can result in permanent physical injury to the mother.<br>  <br>  Laminaria (dehydrated material, usually seaweed) is sometimes used to reduce damage to the cervix. Inserted into the cervix the day before the scheduled abortion, it absorbs water and swells, gradually pushing open the cervix in the process.<br>  <br>  At Eight Weeks<br>  At eight to nine weeks the eyelids have begun forming and hair appears. By the ninth and tenth weeks the preborn child sucks her thumb, turns somersaults, jumps, can squint to close out light, frown, swallow, and move her tongue. <br>  <br>  At this early stage of development, suction abortions are performed using a smaller tube, requiring little dilation of the cervix. This is called "menstrual extraction." However, if all the fetal remains are not removed, infection results, requiring full dilation of the cervix and a scraping out of the womb.<br>  <br>  Suction Aspiration<br>  This is the most common method of abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. General or local anaesthesia is given to the mother and her cervix is quickly dilated. A suction curette (hollow tube with a knife-edged tip) is inserted into the womb. This instrument is then connected to a vacuum machine by a transparent tube. The vacuum suction, 29 times more powerful than a household vacuum cleaner, tears the fetus and placenta into small pieces which are sucked through the tube into a bottle and discarded.<br>  <br>  Dilation and Curettage (D&C)<br>  This method is similar to the suction method with the added insertion of a hook shaped knife (curette) which cuts the baby into pieces. The pieces are scraped out through the cervix and discarded [Note: This abortion method should not be confused with a therapeutic D&C done for reasons other than pregancy.]<br>  <br>  At Twelve Weeks<br>  By the end of the third month all arteries are present, including the coronary vessels of the heart. Blood is circulating through these vessels to all body parts.<br>  <br>  The heart beat ranges during this fetal period from 110 to 160 beats per minute. All blood cells are produced by the liver and spleen, a job soon taken over by the bone marrow. White blood cells, important for immunity, are formed in the lymph nodes and thymus.<br>  <br>  Vocal chords are complete, and the child can and does sometimes cry (silently). The brain is fully formed, and the child can feel pain. The fetus may even suck his thumb. The eyelids now cover the eyes, and will remain shut until the seventh month to protect the delicate optical nerve fibers. <br>  <br>  <br>  14 weeks: Muscles lenghten and become organized. The mother will soon start feeling the first flutters of the baby kicking and moving inside.<br>  <br>  15 weeks: The fetus has an adult's taste buds and may be able to savor the mother's meals. <br>  <br>  16 weeks: Five and a half inches tall and only six ounces in weight, eyebrows, eyelashes and fine hair appear. The child can grasp with his hands, kick, or even somersault.<br>  <br>  At Eighteen Weeks<br>  The fetus is now about 5 inches long. The child blinks, grasps, and moves her mouth. Hair grows on the head and body. <br>  <br>  20 weeks: The child can hear and recognize mother's voice. Though still small and fragile, the baby is growing rapidly and could possibly survive if born at this stage. Fingernails and fingerprints appear. Sex organs are visible. Using an ultrasound device, the doctor can tell if the child is a girl or a boy. The one on the left is a baby girl.<br>  <br>  Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)<br>  This method is used up to 18 weeks' gestation. Instead of the loop-shaped knife used in D&C abortions, a pair of forceps is inserted into the womb to grasp part of the fetus. The teeth of the forceps twist and tear the bones of the unborn child. This process is repeated until the fetus is totally dismember|`|DIqqgNaVaa	this stem cell research will help further medical research to new levels and its not that it saves money but that it is a tool for use in case of birth control failure or rape so abortion is a public service|`|WCkOUF9aaa	No but it doesn't surprise me.<br>  <br>  Almost everything Obama has done so far i disagree with 100%|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I'm delighted that hes getting us out of the dark ages.<br>  For heavens sake if you don't want one don't get one.

mfYfeFCgaa	No. As a pet owner, you have every responsibility to control your animal at all times. This ultimately happened because you neglected to have your dog on a leash, so you have no case against this man legally or civilly and you absolutely owe him for any damage your dog caused him. Some dog owners assume that just because THEY know their dogs to be kind gentle animals, that everyone else should take that for granted just because they say "don't worry, he doesn't bite," but that's not necessarily the case. Your dog may very well have not had any intention on doing him harm and you may have conveyed that to him, but he didn't have any way of knowing that. He doesn't know you or your dog, he was just a passerby who had his child with him, and when he saw a large dog running toward them, he had a genuine fear and had a right to act on it. Now, he may have panicked a little too much and overreacted a little, but that wasn't completely out of line given the circumstances. Your dog scared him and this all happened because he was not restrained. If he had medical bills, he is entitled to expect you to cover them. If I were you, I would get in touch with him to see if he would be willing to settle this between the two of you, because if he sues for his medical expenses, he will most likely win. Maybe if you try smoothing things over by apologizing for the incident and offer to pay his expenses, you may save both of you time and trouble. I understand why you're upset that he hit your dog, but your dog is the one who ran up to him, and he had no legitimate reason to take your word for it when you said he wouldn't bite, and when the dog DID bite him, it's understandable that he was even more scared and maybe a litle angry. Be more careful from now on and don't let your dog run up to people you don't know. Keep him on a leash anytime you're out with him.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	That guy was stupid in my opinion, and shouldn't have panicked, but some people just don't know how to act around dogs and then they spaz out and get bitten. That's one reason why you really shouldn't let your dog out in public without a leash. You could try to argue in court that he provoked your dog by hitting him first (and in most cases, dog owners are let off the hook if the animal was teased or provoked by the victim), but the judge may figure that he was only scared and trying to protect himself and his kid. I have a german shepherd myself, and once in a while we come across people on the street who get frightened and give us dirty looks, even though he's well-behaved and kept on a leash.<br>  <br>  So I don't know, you could try putting him on the defensive by asking to have him charged with animal abuse, but I doubt you'll get anywhere with that.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I would certainly think so. He was cruel to the animal.  Why haven't you called the police already?<br>  You may have been in violation of the leash law, but that is minor compared to the man's attack on your dog.|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	Check your local laws but you are responsible.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	if there are leash laws in your town and your dog was loose, you can be sued and fined. your fault.|`|t8GjNSgDaa	If your dog is not agressive and utd on his shots and has good manners both on and off the leash then yes you could press charges because you told him that your boy doesn't bite. the thing is though you didnt state were you and your dog in your neighborhood or perhaps near your own home and yard. You may look into your state and county's leash laws to be sure.|`|a7720c24204a717ad37e17552b115a47aa	You can always counter sue.

When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and very cheap. It helped me with my dispute, I’m sure someone over there can help you with yours. Anywho, best of luck!!|`|S0PfAlJ0aa	I would say most likely not. You may have had a case if you had your dog restrained or on a leash. He really has a better case against you because the dog was not restrained and he was basically defending himself. Even you were trying to get through to him your dog is ok, He is already in defense mode and what you hear becomes secondary. <br>  Secondly, I have had training concerning dogs as a meter reader. One thing a lot of people don't understand is dogs my be perfectly fine around relatives, friends and their surroundings,  but given different circumstances and people can react in a very unsuspected manner. I don't believe that is the case in your situation, but is something to consider that everyone's understanding of dogs is different and respond in different ways.<br>  I think your best bet is to get some legal advise to protect yourself and may be a life lesson to learn about keeping your dog restrained when out in public for their protection as well as for your dogs protection.<br>  I am not trying to defend what he did, but just trying to put you in his shoes just to give you a different perspective.

968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Talib is an Arabic word meaning "one who is seeking" but the word has evolved to mean "someone who is seeking religious knowledge." <br>  <br>  The Taliban Militia (Students of Islamic Knowledge Movement) rules approximately two thirds of Afghanistan. It was established in 1994, shortly after the Pakistani government announced its intention to establish a trade route through Afghanistan to Central Asia. At this time, Afghanistan was in a state of chaos and under mujahideen rule. The Taliban Militia's aim was to disarm Afghan warlords, return law and order to the country and enforce Islamic law over a united Afghanistan. By February 1995 the Taliban Militia had captured half of the southern provinces of Afghanistan from mujahideen rebels and in September 1996 it took Kabul, the capital city, establishing a strict Islamic rule of law. <br>  <br>  <br>  Al Qaeda is an international terrorist organization founded in the late 1980s, by Osama bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, al-Qaeda calls for the use of violence and force in bringing about the end of non-Islamic governments and, in particular, a wish to drive the US armed forces out of Saudi Arabia and Somalia. Establishing training camps in areas such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya and Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda is responsible for the proliferating of terrorists throughout the world, and providing them with military equipment and financing.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Taliban gave support and assistance to Al Quaeda at the time that Al Quaeda organised the attacks on 9/11, which is why the US went in to Afghanistan and why the Taliban are fighting the NATO forces now|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Bad moon rising"<br>  I see two moons.<br>  Children of Lucifer the great Satan alive himself in "All Blacks" with children of descendant of "Lady in Red".<br>  Throwing pots and pans in bashing up one another with majority in control in running the King out of town.<br>  Luke 21.8-10<br>  Leviticus 26.1<br>  Luke 16.13<br>  Revelation 16.14<br>  Leviticus 26.5<br>  Exodus 20.1-7<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  John 8.44<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  Matt 23.27<br>  Matt 7.15-27<br>  Matt 27.29,37<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|AA11481889	They're Obama's poker buddies.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I think it is an Arabic Type religion and part of the religion is a Type of military training and being in the army and serving to support and defend the Arabic countries.

In his first year Reagan did sign a massive tax cut, most of which was lowering the maximum tax rate of 74% for those making over $3.2 million down to 35%.  In the subsequent 7 years of Reagan's term he then signed 4 tax increases.  Also look again at Obama's economic plan.  There are tax cuts in there for small business.  Incentives for energy efficiencies for business, incentives for hiring and job creation, tax breaks for the middle class.|`|AA11105711	Because it was a short term solution.  Reagan turned the country from a creditor nation to a debtor nation.  The rich got richer at the expense of the middle class.  That was why Clinton won by a landslide over Bush Sr. because people realized Reagonomics was a failure.  Bush Jr. also followed Reaganomics and that is why we have the problems we have now.  Why do insist on following a policy that caused the problem in the first place?|`|nIu8zVkXaa	A Democrat has never seen a tax they didn't like.

QenXm95kaa	A change in the reality of the baser aspects of human nature?<br>  <br>  Unless you have been hiding under a rock or drinking lots of bong water you should be aware of what people are capable of doing in the financial sector if left to their own devices.  First we had waves of companies like Enron committing fraud facilitated by lack of government oversight.  Now we have banks failing due to complete lack of responsible financial management that was enabled by lack of government oversight.  That does not even take into account all the outright fraud of investment funds that has now come to light with Madoff and his ilk.<br>  <br>  Like kids in a candy store and yet some people still think that they should be left unsupervised.  Simply amazing.<br>  <br>  Praising a presidential administration for an era of prosperity is kind of like praising Ronald McDonald because you like your happy meal.  You can point to the huge era of prosperity we had under Clinton as well.  It doesn't mean anything.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	A vaccine.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A vaccine that protects against Liberalism!!!|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Ronald Reagan got his spending money by taxing Americans and by borrowing from the Federal Reserve, just like every other president did. If the years of his term of office seem to have been more comfortable than most, it's because more of the taxed and borrowed money came your way than usually is the case. Reagan was a superb speaker, as you might expect from a man trained as an actor. But he didn't work any miracles, and the costs of taxing and borrowing were the same during his administration as they were in any other.<br>  <br>  Conservatism is too little, too late. Conservatism doesn't work when there's nothing left to conserve, nothing left worth conserving. Conservatism is like trying to give a dead person a blood transfusion, or like locking the barn door after the cows have already escaped.<br>  <br>  Conservatism has a fatal flaw. It isn't RADICAL. Conservatives instigate no controversies; they merely react to them. Out of the average contest between conservatives and liberals, the conservatives usually get more than 50% of things their way -- but it doesn't matter, because the contests are always set up by the liberals, and the liberals always get at least a little bit of what they were trying to get. Afterward, conservatives never fight to regain lost ground, but adjust to the new status quo.<br>  <br>  The struggle between liberals and conservatives is like a man trying to defend his possessions from a thief, but who is forbidden to hurt or kill the thief while doing so. The thief comes in, trying to snatch things, and the only thing the owner can do about it is stand in the way. The thief always gets at least a little of the owner's property and trots away saying "I'll be baaaack!! Ha ha!!"<br>  <br>  Think back about 100 years to a time when there was still enough genuine American culture and freedom that conservatism might have made sense as a course of political action. Were the conservatives back then the same, ideologically, as they are not? Heck no. Back then, there were some REAL conservatives. Now, though, liberals have gained so much ground at conservatives' expense that conservatism today is merely a paler shade of liberalism. Without realizing it, modern conservatives have become what last century's conservatives would have regarded as "the enemy."<br>  <br>  So forget conservatism. It's too late for it. Instead, find yourself a gang that thinks this country ought to be completely TORN DOWN and rebuilt along the lines of strong family values. Think about destroying this old government and creating a new government. Not by elections, but by force. Think not of compromise, but of war. Think not of negotiating, but of breaking things (such as leftists' heads).<br>  <br>  If you keep on kidding yourself that there's a nice way to stop the liberals, then you're on your way to a time when conservatives are the kind of people who think that abortions should be restricted to fetuses who haven't QUITE been born yet. The liberals will be arguing for infanticide--not for eugenic reasons, but merely for the sake of women's convenience or career prospects.<br>  <br>  If you don't embrace violent confrontation with liberals, fighting their street minions with minions of your own, then you're on your way to a time when conservatives are arguing for socialism. The liberals will be trying to bring in full-blown Stalinist communism, kulak executions and all.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	"What is it going to take to bring America back into prosperity like it used to be under Ronald Reagan?"<br>  <br>  Ron was a neocon.

They ran themselves into the ground and need public money to get them out of their 'bad choices'.  Its going to be a long time before the pensioners of Enron, or Bernie Madoffs investors, or the people who owned 'safe blue chip' forget that they lost their money.  Lets be honest, conservatives when they got power weren't very conservative at all.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	A strong leader. So far, the conservative movement does not have one. If Rush Limbaugh is the leader of the conservative movement, conservatism is in big trouble. He can be the mouthpiece for it, but not the leader. He has no ability to afflict change. He is a voice in the wilderness. A rather loud and popular voice, but a voice with no clout.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think conservatives opening up their minds & learning that liberals are not all the things they have been told they are. If they would just do the research rather than listen to the divisiveness they get from Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter. This people are lying I don't even know what a conservative believes in. When I hear them say family values & see they have the same problems as everyone else I don't understand why they think they are different from liberals. I am 50 years old & have been married to the same man since I was 17. I believe in being conservative with money & bought a house at age 19 & had it paid off by age 22. No one I know worked as hard as we did. Yet we keep hearing that liberals are lazy & on welfare. If conservatives are for real about believing all this BS then what is happening is that people from their party are seeing how stupid these comments are & what lies they are so they are going to the democratic party. I could go on & one about all the lies that conservatives believe such as dems being socialist. Dems are different from cons in that they don't push their religious beliefs but usually believe in loving they neighbor as thyself  This means you don't go to war or fight with people but seek understanding & unity. So first the conservatives have to write a mission statement & explain what that really means & how they are different that liberals & be open for debate So they can be told that what they believe is not different They are letting the media believe lies cause there is no game if they are not polarized. We could be a great country. I have hundreds of people I know who are liberals & just about 20 republicans The dems can run a nice country but the reps would talk about each person in a negative way They are too angry all the time|`|AA11620670	no one in the Republican party has this philosophy except for Ron Paul. but Republicans dont like him because he believes the US military should get out of foreign countries and police the world. <br>  real conservatism is dead. the Republican party is controlled by the neo-conservatives|`|ywOqliwKaa	It is happening as we speak.

htxwTAAQaa	No, we didn't.  We disagreed with him and were very disappointed when the supreme court hijacked the election, but we didn't hate the man for no reason.<br>  <br>  Now, his administration's lax attitude about pre-9/11 defense and the gigantic lie to the American people to sell the Iraq war is quite another story.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	You really can't compare the two.  Obama won the election fair and square and by a wide margin.  Bush's presidency was based on having lost the popular vote, gaining a very questionable certification of Florida votes from the very obviously biased Republican Secy of State and getting the US Supreme Court to overrule the Florida Supreme Court, thereby stopping the recount.  Everything depended on one state's Electoral College vote and that issue was badly handled. Bush was, in my opinion, not legitimately the president in 2001.  <br>  <br>  Obama comes into office with no such cloud hanging over his head.  The criticism of him is vicious, unfounded and entirely without merit.  It is a continuation of the "he's an Arab, Muslim, Kenyan, pals around with terrorists, etc." mindless, lying nonsense from the campaign.  I also don't recall any broadcaster stating on the air that he hoped Bush would fail.|`|mL1yi935aa	He lost the popular vote in 2000.<br>  <br>  The Supreme Court gave him the Presidency.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	No, despite the fact that in the eyes of the world and not just in America, he cheated to become president and then it all went downhill from there!|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Some did.

I hear constant references to Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter on here all the time.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	This is apples and oranges.  Bush first came to office under a cloud of doubt and five Justices of the Supreme Court appointed him President.  They claimed it would not be fair to him to have a Florida recount.  President Obama won the election with a margin of 9 million votes.  Nine months into office Bush had unanimous support in the United States and the world.  He squandered it.  There is little in common with the two men and zero reasons for comparison.|`|otYOxmnuaa	It was worse...they were on him from day 1.|`|1amF7oNwaa	A LOT WORSE|`|cWyQc7T7aa	I started despising former President Bush after the Iraq war.<br>  <br>  He was tolerable before that time.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, not until after our troops were sent to Irq.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	NO they didn't.And all of them can tell you exactely when he let our side of the country down.|`|teKeLxX2aa	...Republicans *treated Obama...<br>  <br>  Well, I think you should know had you lived during that time period (which I assume you do, because the average 17 year old on the Internet can't even spell worth a damn). Supporters of Al Gore were a bit ticked off, as there was not a timely or legitimate recount of the ballots. It is highly likely that the election was either rigged, or the benefit of the doubt was given to Bush without due process (which seems likely, considering that the Governor was his brother at the time). <br>  <br>  Normally in any situation that is so close, there is a mandatory recount with greater scrutiny to ensure the validity. Here we are, nearly 3 months after our most recent election, and the Senator of Minnesota hasn't even been decided! The fact that the winner of the 2000 election was done so hastily, gave Al Gore supporters good reason to be angry. <br>  <br>  But I think that two months into Bush's Presidency, most people were willing to go back to things as normal and give Bush a chance. There's no point in being mad about something you can do nothing about, which is why all this complaining over Obama is really getting on my nerves. Overall, more people who vote Republican tend to be manipulated by the mainstream media, so they'll stay mad at Obama probably until things get significantly better (which might not happen; nobody can read the future) or until they stop believing television like the gospel (which is highly unlikely).|`|cIH0QbfMaa	No. When you look at the bipartisan behavior coming from Congress towards the President, both Reagan and Bush I/II had a fair number of Democratic votes even on contentious bills.(Maybe 15-20 out of ~45 Democratic Senators.) Clinton and Obama faced straight party-line opposition time and again. As Clinton remarked, the 3 GOP Senators Obama got for the stimulus were 3 more than Clinton got for some of his early bills.|`|r6JskEtxaa	The Elections weren't accurate.

In Obama's case, a very costly one.|`|TPB7NjvIaa	With accusations of fixing and stealing the election, what would you say?|`|vKR4tysjaa	Here's a quick two pointers for ya:<br>  <br>  1.) When bushie took office, the countries economy was spiraling slowly downward for 6 months PRIOR to him taking office.  Immediately the media jumped on bushie and blamed this on him.  He inherited the "Dot Com" bubble, and things were already slowing down, but it was HIS fault.<br>  <br>  Compare that to today.  obama has taken office.  The stock market has literally collapsed since Nov. 7.  Prior to that date, it was trending very similar to when before bushie took office, a slight downward spiral.<br>  <br>  obama has campaigned to this day (someone should tell him he won the election) that he's inherited bushies economy.  Seems they (lids, socialists, media) want it both ways.<br>  <br>  2.) When Sept 11, 2009 happened, not ONCE did you hear bushie say he inherited billie boys problems.  He could have politicized the inactions of Clinton to death, but chose to take the higher road, and be an American.<br>  <br>  Compare this to how obama has inherited bushies mess due to bushies economical inactions.  These are two identical problems, each inherited due to others inactions, and both responded completely different.  One as if he were a member of a United country, the other as if he's still playing the "blame game" and running for election (even after he's won).  Sounds like one's trying to convince himself he's right, while the other tried to solve a problem.<br>  <br>  What's the lyrics: Stop talking about who's to blame, when all that counts is how to change.  obama should listen to that advice & stop playing the blame game.   It will never unite.<br>  <br>  I have more respect for Clinton than either bush or obama, and I'm a conservative.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Trouble is....  Li'l Bush was already pretty much of a criminal when he came into the White House.  Certainly the 2000 election was stolen - somebody with a LOT of money and influence BOUGHT the Supreme Court - nothing that crooked had never happened before with the Supreme Court.  <br>  <br>  And all you had to do was look at Bush - he was a drunken little zero who'd found his sleazy jesus.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	HELL NO!

LVZdzPmpaa	The United States does not have a "civil union" status for couples. Civil unions are granted by individual states and are recognized only by the state that granted them. So if you have a civil union in Vermont, it won't necessarily be recognized in Florida. <br>  <br>  A civil union grants the same privileges of marriage to same-sex couples. The benefits then are understood. <br>  <br>  There are several sites that detail civil unions and list the states that recognize them.|`|CDe5bEA6aa	The gays use that to make a statement, (We are here and get used to it)  Just another way to get the foot in the door.|`|U95m4LhAaa	A civil union is a legally recognized union similar to marriage. Beginning with Denmark in 1989, civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in many developed countries in order to provide same-sex couples with rights, benefits, and responsibilities similar (in some countries, identical) to opposite-sex civil marriage. In some jurisdictions, such as Quebec, New Zealand, and Uruguay, civil unions are also open to opposite-sex couples.<br>  <br>  Most civil-union countries recognize foreign unions if those are essentially equivalent to their own; for example, the United Kingdom lists equivalent unions in Civil Partnership Act Schedule 20.<br>  <br>  Many people are critical of civil unions because they say they represent separate status unequal to marriage ("marriage apartheid").  Others are critical because they say civil unions are separate but equal - because they allow same-sex marriage by using a different name.

They will have info about the post, classes, events, play groups, volunteering and more.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and enjoy your time with the Army.|`|dGY1r2omaa	A few weeks before he finishes AIT, he should get orders for the base he is going to.  You can search the internet for websites for the base and it will give you all kinds of information on the base itself, community services, etc.  Army Community Services sponsors a lot of family support activities---New Parent Support Group, Financial Planning classes, Army Family Team Building classes (I personally recommend taking the Level 1 classes of that as it will give you all the ins and outs of military life, the lingo, pay system, the soldiers ranks so you know how to address your husband's coworkers and superiors, lol).  Most, but not all units have Family Readiness Groups, and they are only as good as the spouses who volunteer to lead in them, some are great support groups, some are name only, some are more formal, some are fun and friendly and some are henparties full of gossipers.  If you don't have success finding a good FRG or any FRG at all for your husband's unit there, many bases have a group that is base wide All-Spouse Club, or broke down to either Enlisted Spouses or Officer Spouses Clubs.  I've never been in an all base spouses club, but their size gives you more people so that you have better chances of finding someone with common interests and their resources mean more events.  Most of the FRGs I've been in have been good for the most part, a few cracked pots, but mostly good gals.  The one for the unit we are assigned to now our FRG leader alienated a lot of the ladies, so some of us broke of on our own and had a weekly playgroup.<br>  Be a friend to make a friend and you will do just fine.

tXZTi73kaa	If you are going to MEPS, you are going to make a commitment to the military.  Yes, you will have to sign the contract while you are there.  If you're not ready to make the decision, tell the recruiter you don't want to go just yet.<br>  <br>  If you do sign, and then change your mind, never fear.  You CAN get out of your contract up until the time you leave for boot camp.  Don't let your recruiter tell you otherwise.  I have seen numerous people back out of their contracts.|`|ud950KEIaa	When you go to MEPS they will try to get you to sign right away. You DO NOT have to sign anything that day. You can always go back at a later date and sign things, however, you will have to deal with the recruiter giving you crap about it. My advice is look at things like you are buying a car, or a house. Make your demands, college fund or signing bonus and if possible find out which MOS has the best future.

Because he said it would collapse the economy and the federal government.  It would be worth it to get rid of the a**holes in DC.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	I think it occurred right after Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail by Paulson and Geithner in order to demonstrate their tough love commitment to moral hazard, and and one or more money market funds "broke the buck" as a direct result. <br>  <br>  Don't forget that AIG was on the ropes at the same time and there was some real sentiment to let AIG fail as well until the CEO of Goldman Sachs reminded Secretary of the Treasury Paulson that AIG owed Goldman Sachs $20 billion.<br>  <br>  What sane money market investor would have had confidence in the Bush administration's economic team at that point, particularly in view of their complete misunderstanding of the systemic effects of Lehman's collapse and their conflicts of interest. Ben Bernanke's actions did avert a complete and utter collapse of the global economic system, not just America's financial economy.

2ZXh00C5aa	It depends what type of abortion you choose and your income (planned parenthood offers abortions on a sliding scale). The average price, though, is somewhere between $500 and $1,000.|`|f59ce3e6c69a87e4365442d083f0f2b6aa	The price to who?  Is the chick getting the abortion paying for the abortion herself, or is it on the taxpayer's dime?<br>  <br>  Incidentally, it's not just $500.  It's more like $500 and one baby's life.<br>  <br>  What IS the price of a dead baby these days?<br>  <br>  Whatever it was, those little dead babies are going to be worth a lot more now that Obama is going to allow OUR tax money to fund stem cell research.  With all the new stem cell research that's going to occur thanks to Obama opening the public coffers to it, Planned Parenthood ought to be able to get top dollar selling all the dead babies it produces to the stem cell researchers... which will be a motive for Planned Parenthood to encourage even more women to get abortions.<br>  <br>  Yay Obama!

UUJ5SqrAaa	I am a paralegal and they look for organization, knowledge of basic law ie never give legal advice..of course you no that, Some knowledge of what law you will be working at, typing ability, if you have done a brief or other docs make sure you bring them as samples, Remember it is your job to make your attorney look good, of course you screw up it is the attorney that gets the grief not you...always make them look good!  They look for honesty, work ethic, personality and I found that when you go for an interview have some knowledge of the law firm or attorney that you may be working for. I have done domestic relations, custody and juvenile,,,very stressful and you deal with a lot of high emotions. When that type of client yells at you do not take it personally and as hard as it can be to snap back (trust me) you have to place yourself in that person's situation and try to calm the client down by telling the you understand their frustration, etc. I have done Workers' Compensation and Social Security calls are basically the same except this time they have no money for medical records, etc. to pay for their cases. The law is fascinating and frustrating at the same time. Do not let that discourage you. While taking classes you will find out what you enjoy. Just remember, the law is not black and white...it is VERY gray! A lot of people do not understand why some cases get punished more than others it is because of the laws written. You will learn all that. I would not change my major of paralegal for anything! I have done this for over 10 years now. I have learned a lot and still keep learning. Good luck to you!
bJRR9GRraa	Easy answer: As long as booking takes, and yes.<br>  <br>  You cannot be bailed out of jail until you are arrested, booked, and appear before a judge to have bail set.  In several minor charges, there is a "bail schedule," or a predetermined amount of bail set for the crime.  <br>  <br>  The length of time for the bonding process depends on the crime, how busy the jail is, when the person was arrested, etc.  By working with a licensed, bonded bail agent, you can have confidence that they are doing the best they can to get someone out of jail as fast as possible.  In some cases this can just take a few hours. In others, it may take a few days, or longer if you cannot get the bail money together.

Your friend , I am sure, has been re-arrested.  At this time he is being held without bail at the local juvenile detention center.  He will be held there without bond until his hearing.  At that time, it is possible the judge could allow bail, or have him held until trial.  There has to be a trial before he can be sentenced.|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	It depends of that states law.

I you can get into a Police Department with your High School Diploma the will send you to an academy and you will get paid while training. After the academy you will be on a 1 year probation then most large Police departments will assist or pay for your continuing education.  Civilian police departments also pay overtime, military does not and after you've been working 12 hour shifts for months on end in the military you will realize that the civilian sector looks mighty appealing.

This is the provision that any child of the testator (including illegitimate ones) can, if they have been maintained by the testator, make an application to court for provision to be made for them even if they are not mentioned in the will.|`|IWlPfk1raa	As long as something small wasn't left to you then you can get a even cut in the will or insurance policy.

The answer above assumes you are in England or Wales.|`|27vNdc4baa	Robert, this does depend on the law of your country.<br>  <br>  In my country the law states that illigitimate children are regarded children.<br>  <br>  So yes you would be entitled to recieve your share of a will|`|1EVBiYgSaa	Yes. You are still a legal heir. However, expect the legitimate children to contest your part. It may cost a lot of money for attorney fees.

While there are moderates in both the Jewish and Arab communities, the extremists are the mouthpieces. You have the Islamic-extremists on the one side, hell bent on the complete destruction of the Jews and vanquishing of Israel, in the name of a phony deity "Allah." On the other side there are the Zionists, the ones who give the Jews a bad name, with their rigid false belief that they are the ONLY "chosen" people. Their failure to recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah causes them to insist that a chariot of fire will soar down from the skies when the "Messiah" comes and vanquishes the enemies of the Jews.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the war goes on.

So, ishmael the first born through the maidservant is from the Palestine origion and Issac the first borne God chose is first born of Isreal.

AA11494150	The legal term is the Latin phrase "modus operandi" . The literal translation is "way of operating", but the common translation is "mode of operation", abbreviated "M.O."|`|dgQ4MciGaa	Old School Answer (before Miranda): M.O. or Modus Operandi- see "Law N Order".<br>  <br>  New School Answer (after 9/11): Behavioral Profile - see "Criminal Minds".<br>  <br>  Politically Correct Answer (after someone found out criminals are sensitive people with FEELINGS and calling them scum/douche/dirt bags 'hurt their feelings'): Person of Interest - see "FBI Files".<br>  <br>  Common Sense Answer (the one most commonly used by law enforcement types): Signature, aka 'the sig', 'calling card', 'mark', 'characteristic identifying feature of the crime'. - see any police report.<br>  <br>  If you're writing a story keep in mind the characters' 'voice', the word choice/way she/he would use the term.  Examples (poor ones - you can do better).<br>  <br>  Old school: "The M.O. here is the same as all the other cases; find a blond, get her drunk, take her to a secluded spot, choke her with her own pantyhose, and leaver her body propped up at a bus stop".<br>  Lenny: "Yeah, but don't leave her any bus tokens". (theme music fades the secene to black).<br>  <br>  New school: "Based on previous cases, we're looking for a white male, 35-40 years old, who prefers blond phenotypes, can afford expensive liquor in large quantities, owns an older model truck or van, something capable of going off-road, uses the victims clothing as the murder weapon, and is remorseful afterward.  He poses the victim at a bus stop, as if she were still alive and simply going home."<br>  Lenny (again): "Yeah, but he still didn't spring for the bus fare." (theme music, only more pompous, fade to black).<br>  <br>  Feminist school:( yeah, I know, but anyway...) "Strong, self-reliant, independent woman is unfairly and sexestly (? is that even a word?) accosted by male chauvenist pig, inadequate white male, age 12 to 75, who drives old, unwashed pickup truck with gun rack and six pack, taken to isolated location where no one would notice that she OBVIOUSLY did not belong with HIM, cruelly choked with expensive nylons from Saks 5th. Ave. and posed at bus stop, probably to suggest she was a 'bag lady'."<br>  Lenny (totally worn out after six weeks of being partnered with feminist-activist female detective who only got promoted because of 'Afemmitive Action'): "Yeah, but he went through her Gucci handbag<br>  and took her cell phone so she couldn't call a cab." (theme music... interrupted!?!)<br>  "The hand bag is Prada!  Some detective YOU are."<br>  <br>  PC school:  "From the smell of cheap perfume, the bleached hair, ratty, well-used pantyhose, and the lack of bus tokens, I submit that our POI (person of interest) is a poorly paid, over-worked, white male, age 30-40, from a lower class ethic, who was cruelly abused by his mother, abandoned by his alchoholic father, forced to leave school at an early age (possibly 8 or 9) to support his mothers' Robatussin habit,<br>  and ultimately left alone by his mothers' thoughtless and lingering death.  Lonely and vulnerable, he was lured to an isolated spot on the promise of 'better things to come' only to discover that she required monetary recompense for favors received.

Hmmm.  Wonder if she'll need a transfer as well.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Generally, the term modus operandi (M.O.) represents the functional components which are necessary for an offender to be successful in committing a crime.  Historically, M.O. has been used to link cases because offenders will use similar methods during the commission of their crimes. M.O. can include factors such as; a time of day or location an offender chooses to strike, the type of victim, points or techniques for gaining entry, as well as tools used for committing the crime. <br>  <br>  However, M.O. can change over time as offenders become more experienced or learn new techniques that will make them more successful or lower their chances of being identified.  For example, an offender may always strike at night, gaining entry to the location by using a glasscutter and shooting a victim.  This can completely change however, if the offender learns that using a suction cup with the glasscutter and a knife to kill the victim will create less noise.  Again, everything mentioned above are factors that are necessary to commit the crime. <br>  <br>  Signature aspects on the other hand, are behaviors that go beyond what is necessary to commit the crime and fulfill a psychological need of the offender.  Unlike M.O., signature aspects are stable over time and will be witnessed at each crime scene throughout a series.  Although there may be subtle differences from crime to crime, there will be an evident theme.  As this theme represents a psychological need of the offender, signature seems to be based heavily upon, and reflect the offender's fantasies.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	Yes it his MO, but MO stand for modus operani, a rough translation is mode of operation or simply mode.|`|qOw6IFZwaa	His signature|`|0FwVGYEYaa	his M.O ,motive and operation

UUJ5SqrAaa	Yep at 18 you will probably have a misdemeanor on your record depending that you have done nothing else STUPID! You might get a nice lecture and community service but you will have to pay the fees and costs. You need a lawyer or a public defender. If you do not have one when you go to court ask the judge you want to represented and they will continue the case until you get representation. NOTE do not go in front of ANY judge with a lot of jewelry, call him/her your honor and dress like you are going to church. Judge's are like GOD be VERY respectful. Good Luck|`|S253XERKaa	yes it will be on your record since your 18 ok you want to know what might happen in court if this is your first time of getting in trouble the judge might have you do two month of community service or 30 day's in jail you will be lucky if it not posted in the news paper you may think shop lifting is not a big deal it can miss you up when looking for a job you would have been better off getting a speeding ticket hay i hope every thing work out for you  AND BY THE WAY I AM NOT LAW ER BUT I PLAY ONE ON  QUESTION AND ANSWER|`|aMELFGh0aa	Most states will allow you to get a misdemeanor charge expunged from your record one to three years after your sentenced. As long as you only have one charge on your record you should be able to get it expunged. If you get in trouble again you will be considered a repeat offender and you will not be able to expunge anything, and if you expunge a charge and then get in trouble, the first charge will most likely be reinstated to your record. Check with the local probation department to get the specifics on<br>  how to expunge your record.|`|epbzW5N8aa	Tell your family, it depends on if the charge was a felony are not if it stays on your record, you will most likely get probation, some community service and a fine and something mailed to your address. TELL YOUR PARENTS because they may find out.|`|74f74357f1e97881285bef9af7de548faa	Both 18 so it will appear as a conviction for shoplifting. <br>  You will both most likely be barred from the store or when you are in the store you will be watched closely.<br>  <br>  Shoplifting is one of the main reason the Items go up in price if you steal even a cheap item the store still has to pay for that item and in order to maintain a profitable business they will raise the price to overcome the loss by theft.<br>  <br>  Take whatever the judge gives you and don't do it again. I would also rethink my friendship with this person.|`|S0PfAlJ0aa	Innocent bystander is not totally honest. Though you had no intention of shoplifting you went along with it. If you have any relationship with your parents (even though you are adult status) would talk to them about it and admit you screwed up and used poor judgment. They are your best ally right now and if they are concerned at all will help you through this.<br>  It is best to cooperate with the authorities and be genuine in your appeal that you were caught off guard on what happen and maybe they may go easier on you.<br>  Everybody screws up at some point or an other, but those who succeed admit to their mistakes and learn from them. <br>  Two lessons to learn here are pick quality friends and if your conscience is telling something is wrong, listen to it.|`|27vNdc4baa	It's so sad that we don't react in situations. Unfortunately it seems like you don't have a defense, you were in no risk of telling her to put the things back. <br>  <br>  With regards to the charges, if you are a first time offender, the judge may issue a suspended sentence, which means if you commit another crime with in 3 years, then you will be charged for that crime and for this crime. Which means you wont spend any time in jail now.<br>  <br>  He may also order you to do community service. Best advice is get an attorneys opinion, as I dont know the law where you live but the law where i live! (i'm a penultimate year law student)<br>  <br>  Hope it goes ok!<br>  <br>  J

I bet you didn't, you lousy liberal HYPOCRITE.|`|crbDVI29aa	That is their goal, but more than simply turning our society into a socialist (nee fascist) one, their goal is to simply gain power, hold onto it, and then gain more.<br>  <br>  It just so happens that a fascist system is the most efficient way to do it.|`|zPpgohF9aa	Anyone with half a brain can see this is whats  happening , and I am afraid for the future of this country!<br>  <br>  kilroy44...LOVE YOUR RESPONSE!|`|zB7Hl7x2aa	yes!!|`|WKvl8zlCaa	You make the mistake of conflating 'socialism' with 'liberalism'.To me, a more 'liberal' govt. would be a good thing.   This is a country ruled by, for, and with the people !  If a MAJORITY of American voters elected President Obama, then that makes him an AMERICAN PRESIDENT.  Got a problem with that? Maybe if the Republicans dump the fascist racist wing of their party, the Americans would find the message more palatable ! Yes , the racists are very loud, and the commercially driven news companies are desperate for ratings, so they smear that crap all over the screen to get a 'rise' out of the viewers, and increase the ratings.  Not the best way to inform the populace. As long as these fools get a 'voice' in the news, the ignorant xenophobes will clamor for attention !  There is no way this country, or the world , will go back to the days of slavery and apartheid, disguised as a political movement.  The question should really be, "What is the "goal" of the extreme right wing whites in America?''|`|PYsKp4ADaa	That is very odd that he would say that because during 1944 the democrats were considered to be the conservative party and the republicans were considered to be liberals, the change didn't really come until Richard Nixon.  I am neither a democrat nor a liberal, but we face troubling times, and it is important as Americans that we stand together behind our leaders.  What Obama is doing is far from socialism anyways, and you would know that if you have ever truly listened to a socialist speech.|`|AA11450062	Our goal is to have some social programs that protect Americans from being harmed any longer by Republican economics, but don`t worry, we don`t want OUR government making your shoes, or Communist China making our shoes with the industrial might that Republicans gave them.

You have it wrong: no one is picking on Obama, and I mean no one.  Look at all he is doing and no one has stopped him.  Think about it:  even media are saying that Obama is giving us money.  Journalists do not have the guts to be honest and say that Obama is releasing OUR money, and that we are all going to pay later for those who did not know how to manage their finances, their households, and/or their banks.  Who is picking on Obama?  No one.  No one.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	You can not buy a failing business,throw a few trillion into it and hope that it will recover when you have higher taxes looming out their.The only way that I know of to recover is to create jobs by giving employers incentive to hire more people.California unemployment rate has grown to between 8 to 10 %.All of the taxes from these people are gone till they go back to work.Credit card limits need to be cut back severely.We may see a flood of bankrupt credit card holders soon.Treasury Secretary Mr.Geithner seems to know the only way out of total disaster,and I hope he is right. I believe Mr. Obama is trying very hard and people are scared and that is why they pick on him .I feel Mr.Obama is not good at economics and people know it.Things are way out of balance and mostly caused by the huge increase in fuel prices of two years ago that did not leave enough money to pay mortgages and that`s why this recession reached world wide proportions.When each family decides to meet their own budget without over spending ,then and only then will you as a family as a nation recover.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	I am just going to vent here, and say that the Bush Administration has been the most virulently anti-science administration since the dawn of the 20th century.  It has totally catered to the far religious right, which already harbors outright animosity towards science, and it has snubbed or even shut out science at every turn at the policy-making level.  It wouldn't have mattered even if scientists created exact duplicates of fetal stem cells from elemental scratch, the Bushnites would have found ways to squelch it on grounds that it is "anti-life".  What the Bushnites really mean is that it is "anti-God", since that's something only reserved for God, and not for anti-god scientists to do.  It is totally irrelevant to the Bushnites that millions of lives can be saved or suffering reduced through stem cell research and application.  It IS a political matter to them, and the battling sides here are Forces of God versus the Forces of Darkness to them. And we wonder at Islamic extremism around the world today?|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I think you are not paying attention to what the SCIENTISTS are saying...<br>  No, all stem cells ARE NOT the same as fetal ones.  Current research (coming out of other countries) show that the fetal cells are MORE LIKELY to result in successful treatments. So.. there IS A DIFFERENCE. <br>  The debate is in the source of the fetal cells, and the belief of "some" that it is immoral, and "might" lead to more abortions. Which is kind of an irrational thinking.. people will get abortions, or they won't get abortions. The USE of the fetal cells is not related to laws about abortions. Yet those opposed to abortions have "created" a correlation, which they turned into opposition to the use of the fetal cells entirely. <br>  The reality is that research leads to the LIKELIHOOD that this research can either treat or cure diseases that are otherwise incurable. In other words.. it CAN SAVE LIVES. If you have a family member involved in one of those diseases/ issues, this really sinks in. Otherwise, it is all academic. <br>  Obama's position is that RESEARCH should be unbiased, especially that which is potentially life saving, and not influenced or restricted by opposition which comes from a religious perspective. It is nuts to withhold federal funds from something that can literally save lives.|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	Not all stem cells are created equal.<br>  <br>  Blood stem cells can form all cells that circulate in blood (white blood cells and red blood cells for example). They can't make neurons or muscle cells. <br>  <br>  Embryonic stem cells are "pluripotent", meaning they have the potential to form ANY cell in the body.  The research is aimed at understanding HOW they can be guided to make the cells that are desired.<br>  <br>  So, some disease could be cured by either "adult" stem cells (bone marrow transplant is currently used to cure cancers of the blood forming cells in the bone marrow). The promise of embryonic stem cell research is its potential application to a whole range of diseases.|`|2ZXh00C5aa	Well, I'm not an expert in the area, but I think embryonic stem cell research has more potential to cure some seriously ******-up diseases/disorders.|`|ExqJ0ge0aa	Embryonic stem cells (not fetal stem cells) are unique and different from any other type of stem cell, because they are able to become any type of cell.  And it is political because Reagan signed a bill preventing it from being funded the same as other research, and every other democrat has reversed that, and every other republican has upheld it.  Funny, Mrs Reagan now supports it.  You really become educated on this kind of stuff when it affects YOUR family|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	I'm not too sure about it- but if if the tech could be used to clone another Reagan or George W., or a "Dick" Cheney, could the human race afford it?<br>     I'm half-kidding. If it could help people like Michael J. Fox, or people with Alzheimer's or diabetes, it should go through Congress like s*** through a goose.<br>   But there happen to be special interests that stand to make a whole lot of money treating serious diseases like those, and cures for them would end the gravy train. They really DON'T want a cure to be found for them. <br>    But I think you're right in asking if it's political. It is.|`|m24wuDzwaa	Fact: no pluripotent stem cell has yet been created that can fully replace the potential of an embryonic stem cell. this is not directed at you, but I fail to see how allowing an adult human being to die to save a clump of cells smaller than the head of a pin can possibly be described as "pro-life".|`|AA11010672	shouldnt this be in chemistry or physics really ,<br>  Fraid i dont know mam ,|`|ILZY7BD0aa	If a cell can help why now use it?  I have no idea how one person can fix every problem..|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Nevertheless fetal cells, work better for some purposes, and the cultivation of adult cells is more complicated. So I favor both approaches , because I don't think science should be politicized.
nHuMeLtyaa	A booby trap is a device set up to be triggered by an unsuspecting victim. As the word trap implies, they often have some form of bait designed to lure the victim towards it. However, in other cases the device is triggered when the victim performs some type of everyday action e.g. opening a door, picking something up or switching something on. Lethal booby traps are often used in warfare, particularly guerilla warfare, and traps designed to cause injury or pain are also sometimes used by criminals wanting to protect drugs or other illicit property, and by some owners of legal property who wish to protect it from theft.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	A trap set to surprise or injure an unsuspecting person. <br>  <br>  Example: He boobie-traped the door so the bucket of paint would fall on anyone who opened it.|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	I always thought it was a type of bra.

We had a depression in 1921, President Harding did nothing, he did not prop up the economy or try to bail out failing businesses.  We came out of our depression in about a year.  We had another depression around 1930.  President Hoover tried to prop up the economy, and bail out businesses.

Not let the dimwit House Democrats craft a stimulus bill. When the biggest national concern is the economy, and when your presidency will likely be judged on economic policy and this likely being the biggest bill of this administration, I'd have drafted it myself, with input from both parties (you know, the bipartisanship that Obama doesn't do), and especially from top economists. It wouldn't be more spending (a failed Bush policy) or more tax rebates to the poor and middle class (another failed Bush policy).<br>  <br>  It would include the provisions of S.2592 (110th) for tax cuts, and would also include the extended benefits and rebates to the poor that other Republican plans had.<br>  <br>  2. The problem with the finance markets is that both loans and securities must flow. If they don't the economy can't work.

Since that point the economy has been in the tank and flushing fast.<br>  And fwiw, the stimulus plan doesn't seem to be doing much.

And we couldn't agree more. First up in the court dock: Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. <br>  <br>  Even by the extraordinarily loose standards of Congress, it takes some chutzpah for someone such as Frank to suggest that he'll seek prosecutions for those behind the housing and financial crunch and for what he called "a strongly empowered systemic risk regulator."<br>   <br>  Frank: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's point man in Washington.<br>  <br>  For Frank, perhaps more than any single individual in private or public life, is responsible for both the housing market mess and subsequent bank disaster. And no, this isn't partisan hyperbole or historical exaggeration.<br>  But first, a little trip down memory lane.<br>  It was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two so-called Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), that lay behind the crisis. After regulatory changes made to the Community Reinvestment Act by President Clinton in 1995, Fannie and Freddie went into hyper-drive, channeling literally trillions of dollars into the housing markets, using leverage and implicit taxpayers' guarantees.<br>  In November 2000, President Clinton's Housing and Urban Development Department would trumpet "new regulations to provide $2.4 trillion in mortgages for affordable housing for 28.1 million families." The vehicles for this were Fannie and Freddie. It was the largest expansion in housing aid ever.<br>  Still, from the early 1990s on, many people both inside and outside Washington were alarmed by what they saw at Fannie and Freddie.<br>  Not Barney Frank: Starting in the early 1990s, he (and other Democrats) stood athwart efforts by regulators, Congress and the White House to get the runaway housing market under control.<br>  He opposed reform as early as 1992. And, in response to another attempt bring Fannie-Freddie to heel in 2000, Frank responded it wasn't needed because there was "no federal liability there whatsoever."<br>  In 2002, Frank nixed reforms again. See a pattern here?<br>  Even after federal regulators discovered in 2003 that Fannie and Freddie executives had overstated earnings by as much as $10.6 billion in order to boost bonuses, Frank didn't miss a beat.<br>  President Bush pushed for what the New York Times then called "the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago."<br>  If it had passed, the housing crisis likely would have never boiled over, at least not the extent it did, taking the economy with it. Instead, led by Frank, Democrats stood as a bloc against any changes.<br>  "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not facing any kind of financial crisis," Frank, then the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, said. "The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing."<br>  It's hard to say why Frank did all this. It could be his close ties to the Neighborhood Assistance Corp., a powerful housing activist group based in Boston, which controls billions in loans. Or that he received some $40,100 in campaign donations from Fannie and Freddie from 1989 to 2008. Or that he has been romantically linked to a one-time executive at Fannie during the 1990s.<br>  Whatever the case, his conflicts are obvious and outrageous, and his refusal to countenance reforms of Fannie and Freddie contributed mightily to today's meltdown. If you're looking for a culprit in the meltdown to prosecute, no one fits the bill better than Barney Frank.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Well, it really should be traced all the way back to Woodrow Wilson, but people will blame either George Bush or Barack Obama because people have a notoriously short memory.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Obama and his chronies.|`|JCxE0mq9aa	GWB.

People like Michael steele and Bobby Jindal. You need to step back and see how truly funny this whole thing is. I guess it just brings a little levity to our serious situation seeing you people take this bloated, gas-addled gas bag so seriously.

After all, Bill&Hill hammered out the "preferred nation status" trade agreement with China and even now Old Hill wants to give China "Eminent Domain" status. Now I wonder if we can claim any "Eminent Domain" in China and what "Domain" can China claim as its own here in the states. Hopefully they can claim the Democratic Congress, Senate and White House and take them home to China so that they can continue to perform their "Madness Opera" for the Chinese government.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Blame?  Odd choice of words.  Where would we be right now if China was not wealthy enough to finance our debt?  <br>  <br>  Opening trade with China was a brilliant move.

The Idiot's Guide to Chinagate <br>  <br>   <br>  China will likely replace the USA as world leader, said Bill Clinton in a recent Washington Post interview. It is just a matter of time. Clinton should know. He has personally done more to build China’s military strength than any man on earth. <br>  <br>  Most Americans have heard of the so-called "Chinagate" scandal. Few understand its deadly import, however. Web sites such as "Chinagate for Dummies" and its companion "More Chinagate for Dummies" offer some assistance. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, with a combined total of nearly 8,000 words, these two sites – like so many others of the genre – offer more detail than most of us "dummies" can absorb.<br>  <br>  For that reason, in the 600 words left in this column, I will try to craft my own "Idiot’s Guide to Chinagate," dedicated to all those busy folks like you and me whose attention span tends to peter out after about 750 words. <br>  <br>  Here goes.<br>  <br>  When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, China presented no threat to the United States. Chinese missiles "couldn’t hit the side of a barn," notes Timothy W. Maier of Insight magazine. Few could reach North America and those that made it would likely miss their targets.<br>  <br>  Thanks to Bill Clinton, China can now hit any city in the USA, using state-of-the-art solid-fueled missiles with dead-accurate, computerized guidance systems and multiple warheads.<br>  <br>  China probably has suitcase nukes as well. These enable China to strike by proxy – equipping nuclear-armed terrorists to do its dirty work while the Chinese play innocent. Some intelligence sources claim that China maintains secret stockpiles of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons on U.S. soil, for just such contingencies.<br>  <br>  In 1997, Clinton allowed China to take over the Panama Canal. The Chinese company Hutchison Whampoa leased the ports of Cristobal and Balboa, on the east and west openings of the canal, respectively, thus controlling access both ways. <br>  <br>  A public outcry stopped Clinton in 1998 from leasing California's Long Beach Naval Yard to the Chinese firm COSCO. Even so, China can now strike U.S. targets easily from its bases in Panama, Vancouver and the Bahamas.<br>  <br>  How did the Chinese catch up so fast? Easy. We sold them all the technology they needed – or handed it over for free. Neither neglect nor carelessness is to blame. Bill Clinton did it on purpose.<br>  <br>  As a globalist, Clinton promotes "multipolarity" – the doctrine that no country (such as the USA) should be allowed to gain decisive advantage over others.<br>  <br>  To this end, Clinton appointed anti-nuclear activist Hazel O'Leary to head the Department of Energy. O'Leary set to work "leveling the playing field," as she put it, by giving away our nuclear secrets. She declassified 11 million pages of data on U.S. nuclear weapons and loosened up security at weapons labs.<br>  <br>  Federal investigators later concluded that China made off with the "crown jewels" of our nuclear weapons research under Clinton’s open-door policy – probably including design specifications for suitcase nukes.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Clinton and his corporate cronies raked in millions.<br>  <br>  In his book "The China Threat," Washington Times correspondent Bill Gertz describes how the system worked. <br>  <br>  Defense contractors eager to sell technology to China poured millions of dollars into Clinton's campaign. In return, Clinton called off the dogs. Janet Reno and other counterintelligence officials stood down while Lockheed Martin, Hughes Electronics, Loral Space & Communications and other U.S. companies helped China modernize its nuclear strike force.<br>  <br>  "We like your president. We want to see him re-elected," former Chinese intelligence chief Gen. Ji Shengde told Chinagate bagman Johnny Chung.<br>  <br>  Indeed, Chinese intelligence organized a massive covert operation aimed at tilting the 1996 election Clinton's way.<br>  <br>  Clinton's top campaign contributors for 1992 were Chinese agents; his top donors in 1996 were U.S. defense contractors selling missile technology to China.<br>  <br>  Clinton recieved funding directly from known or suspected Chinese intelligence agents, among them James and Mochtar Riady, who own the Indonesian Lippo Group; John Huang; Charlie Trie; Ted Sioeng; Maria Hsia; Wang Jun and others.<br>  <br>  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown served as Clinton's front man in many Chinagate deals. When investigators began probing Brown's Lippo Group and Chinagate connections, Brown died suddenly in a suspicious April 1996 plane crash.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, China does not share Clinton's enthusiasm for globalism or multipolarity. The Chinese look out for No. 1.<br>  <br>  "War [with the United States] is inevitable; we cannot avoid it," said Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian in 2000. "The issue is that the Chinese armed forces must control the initiative in this war."<br>  <br>  Bill Clinton has given them a|`|nxymxSUFaa	That honor should go to that closet communist male whore Bubba Clinton.

And no am not a communist, but did live in a communist country...and the large accent is on human resources, human values...and if on the job you got a great time saving idea, you actually get a nice bonus in your paycheck.<br>  Yes rules are rigid, very black and white, but you know what the rules are and its there to protect you. So if you are a responsible decent person, you need no gun as owning a gun you will use it when things get out of control..the whole concept of communism is to provide you with a kind of lifestyle that makes you a proud member of the human race and not tolerated or made fun of over your nation of origin...oh yes your education is also free...but you are taxed heavily and no a communist country is not geared to a throw away Society and living beyond your means, but you only buy things you saved for and most build their own home and own it outright...or rent an apartment thats owed by the Govt and the rent is decided on the wages you make, leaving you ample founds for  living expenses. You got any problem with any of this?<br>  No i do not think Obama is a communist, but i believe he will not be dazzled by the rich, but will break his back to support the little guy and give them every chance and every help to leave povery line behind<br>  Its nice that a guy can make 250K a year, but when we got people sleeping on the street and homeless...i think out of that 250K he can well afford to help those who can't help themselves and not complain<br>  Bank bailouts are part of the package to cover the loss the banks suffer from bad loans...rather then allow people to loose their home, he saves it for them in this way.<br>  Why do you think this worse then Bush sending the country broke with the war all over the place...it costs money and lives...did you notice that?
UvzKiis0aa	Apparently Obama listened to people and their concerns, since health care is one of the main concerns of the American people according to most political polls during the election cycle.<br>  <br>  One of the leading causes of bankruptcy in the USA is medical bills.   The cost of medical care has been skyrocketing ever since Reagan allowed hospitals, etc. to become for profit.  (They used to be not for profit.)<br>  <br>  Just think of the costs removed from big business, from small business, and from entrepreneurs if they didn't have to worry about providing health care insurance.

Cut all ties and contact with your "kids father", including canceling and returning mail addressed to him, removing his name from any joint accounts, financial obligations or government records, changing your phone number, and ceasing contact with any third party individuals which are acquainted with both you and he.<br>  <br>  3. Move to a different residence.<br>  <br>  4. Retain the services of reputable legal counsel with the intent being to reduce the occasions of uninvited contact by law enforcement authorities (who have the legal authority to enter any domicile which they reasonably believe a wanted futigive is taking shelter, or under "exigent circumstances") who, depending on which part of your story you choose to stand behind, either showed you or didn't show you the search warrant that they likely had with them - another legal way for them to enter your home.<br>  <br>  So far, I haven't been able to see where there has been any "harassment" or encroachment on your rights at all.

Get yourself down to the DA's office, and don't talk to an associate!!! Explain the situation to them, and that you have cooperated with them all along, but, this constant barging into your home is too much for you to handle. Tell him, you DON"T know where your husband is, and tell him you will even take a lie detector test to prove it! Tell him you want this harassment stopped or you will file suit against the Police Department and the city for allowing this to happen, What it is doing to your children, who absolutely innocent!

eTspmrjMaa	One usually comes with the other when selling. Most dealers that sell one will sell the other as well. Smack (heroin) is the main though, almost all heroin users do both smack and rock (Crack Cocaine) is solid form that is is mixed with water and bicarbonate of soda, dried out to become as solid as a rock which is where it get's it's name and smoked on a pipe. You couldn't get a job that would make you the same money in your lifetime that would match selling both smack and crack at the same time for just a year of your life. The powder form of cocaine is not as lucrative as either of the former mentioned drugs but can still make you a substantial amount of money with powder cocaine, depending on where you live and who you know. If you are careful and know when you have made enough money and are not a greedy person and know when to quit while you are ahead, you don't go to jail. If you are stupid which a lot of monkey's are that try selling this stuff then you will only end up in one place.|`|H10X8Sylaa	I appreciate the stories from drug users/abusers and their struggles with addiction.. and their experience with heroin and/or cocaine.<br>  <br>  The question was, which is more lucrative?<br>  <br>  I think you would need statistics from the DEA, although probably distorted, and you would need to talk to drug dealers and see which is more lucrative.<br>  <br>  People with experience using the drugs would have their opinions on which is more lucrative yes, but you would need to talk to the bosses, and drug enforcement agencies to see which drug is more lucrative.|`|uY6cftZqaa	I believe you would make more money selling heroin.

Wpulf29Maa	a lot|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	It depends what you are looking for, you can find out addresses, criminal, income etc.|`|UcizgK8maa	If depends on the level of clearance your after. i.e. secret or top secret.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Well, it sort of depends on who is running the background check. I have been arrested twice now on another woman's warrants because we have the same name and she is only one day older than I am.  After sitting in holding for a while they checked the prints and I was released. I also nearly lost a job because a private company did a background check and the other person with my name popped up again. It took me a little over a week  to prove it wasn't me with all the warrants. I got my job back and they paid me for my  time.  <br>  <br>  Yes, mistakes do happen. When I was talking to the people who actually ran the background check, they told me they were aware that the birthdays didn't match but sent the info to my employer anyway (with MY birth date, not hers!) because a lot of people LIE when they get in trouble. So if it's even close to your name and birth date, some places that do background checks will assume it is you who is the naughty person.<br>  <br>  I'd wonder more why your parents would have the urge to run a background check on someone than if there was a way to obfuscate the issue.|`|OxFzFDgVaa	criminal records (could be hers, his, family members etc)<br>  where they are from (the type of people they are)<br>  what they do for a living<br>  etc|`|1KGXts5Daa	The term "background check" is generic.  There are numerous types of such checks, utilized for different purposes.<br>  <br>  In answer to your specific questions, "background checks" as to history of an individual which may be purchased from various internet sites usually reveal name, DOB, address history, real estate ownership, certain financial information, legal judgments and possible relatives of the person who is being checked.<br>  <br>  A photograph is not typically included on such internet sites.|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	First of all, if your parents got the information from a website, then they paid to get it.  There are NO free services online to do background checks.  It's more likely they heard about it by word-of-mouth.<br>  <br>  Second, you're wondering if it's possible for them to have made a mistake and found the wrong person.  It's possible if they used an online service, they could have matched the data from a wrong individual, although that is not likely.  The online services will usually give you secondary information that helps to confirm you have the right person...things like address, phone, e-mail, car license plate #, drivers license #, height, weight, eye color, etc.

The American right has no ideas to fix anything, they just advocate policies that rob the American people of their shared property, prosperity and services in the name of lower taxes and freedom.

Can the stimulus plan restore every job that has been lost? No, and no one is claiming that it can. Contrary to what his opponents claim, Obama does not believe government can solve every problem. He believes it can help. And yes, creating or saving 3 million jobs will help. <br>  <br>  Yeah, even if the stimulus plan creates 3 million jobs, there is a net loss from the time the rescession started. But the way I see it, that's better than a net loss of 4.5 million if the 3 million weren't created. Do you disagree?<br>  <br>  And if he saves 3 million rather than creating 3 million, that's still 3 million people who aren't added to the misery. 3 million families who won't be worrying about how to meet their housing costs, how to buy clothes for their kids or send them to college, 3 million families who won't have a bread-earner or two sitting up late at night unable to sleep because of sick worry about the future.<br>  <br>  What is wrong with you that makes you think preventing that misery for 3 million families is a joke?|`|BFAbMbrIaa	It's nothing but another politician talking out of their a**...

There are still some protections in place for publicly owned companies above a certain number of employees to help  promote diversity. However, you don't have to hire someone just to fill a 'quota' for minorities, gender or ethnic. (Well, not in the US anyway)  If you have two people, one white and one non-white, and the white person is a better fit for the position you are attempting to fill or better qualified, you still hire the white person. You simply must have the same standards for everyone and document test scores, answers to interview questions, etc. As long as everything is documented and it is clear there was no discrimination, you may hire whomever you wish regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religious affiliation, whatever.<br>  <br>  In some European countries no more than 60% of either gender can make up the work force in publicly owned companies of a certain number of employees. Race doesn't enter the picture there because most European countries don't have racism as an issue in this day and age.|`|eIQ5T2amaa	Technically, there are not laws that say an employer cannot hire a white person. In reality, though, the rules that demand an employer higher a given number of blacks, asians, hispanics, etc. do make a law banning too many white employees. These laws are stupid. They were created to remove discrimination, but have only increased it. How can it be said that a place is an "equal opportunity employer," when they hire a black person to fill a quota instead of the better qualified white person. By the way, that does not mean all white people are better qualified for jobs than blacks, but it's just an example. I, for example, am a white guy. Because of all the "equal opportunity" laws, I am actually more discriminated against than many other people. Before you click the thumbs-down button, read on. My school of choice is the University of Texas at Austin. The school prides itself on diversity, and so it is harder for me to get into the school (even with a good SAT score, and a 4.0 high school GPA) than it would be for a person of a different color (or even a white woman) to get into the school. These "equal opportunity" laws are stupid, and they just promote discrimination.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Qualified is a relative term.  There are many qualities one has to meet.

Average worker paychecks are worth less now than in 1973, but CEOs and other rich Americans not only make much more, they pay less in taxes.<br>  <br>  Average full-time workers made $41,198 in 1973 and $37,606 in 2008, adjusted for inflation.<br>  <br>  CEOs made 45 times as much as workers in 1973 and more than 300 times as much as workers now. The top tax rate was 70% in 1973 and just 35% now; taxpayers pay the top rate on the portion of taxable income that falls within the highest bracket and pay lower rate s on income below that. The top rate for capital gains on the sale of stock and other assets was 36.5% in 1973 and 15% now.<br>  <br>  Irrational pay and tax cuts have generated a massive redistribution of income and wealth from workers to CEOs, hedge fund managers and others in the richest 1%.<br>  <br>  By 2006, the richest 1% had increased their share of the nation's income to the second-highest level on record. The only year higher was 1928 -- on the eve of the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  According to the latest IRS data, excluding tax-exempt interest income from state and local government bonds, the richest 400 taxpayers had an average adjusted gross income of $263 million each on their federal income tax returns in 2006 -- up from $221 million in 2005 and $67 million in 1992, adjusted for inflation.<br>  <br>  Edit: Is this what the superRich are so upset about?<br>  "He (Obama) also proposes to eliminate the fund managers’ tax break that allowed managers of hedge and equity funds (some of the richest people in the country) to pay tax at just a 15 percent rate.

Don't pretend that conservatives would normally be okay with the government invading the private lives of citizens.  Also just because you aren't a terrorist doesn't mean that you want someone to invade your privacy.  As for the UN being pointless, we agreed to the rules and we are part of the problem.  America has WMDs along with Russia, China, Japan, France, England and now Pakistan.  Why wouldn't the other nations want it?  Couldn't the US invade them as it has Vietnam, Iraq, Korea and Afghanistan?  The UN can do nothing without the world powers coming to some agreement...THAT is what is tying the UN's hands.  The UN should be completely independent.  It should have its' own army, money and the right to stop any country (including the US) when it attacks another country unjustly.<br>  <br>  As for healthcare being a crisis under Clinton, Hillary tried to fix it and the conservatives stood in her path...as they continued to stand in our path under Bush.  And you know I meant tax CUTS not INCREASES, just a typo.  And we don't "moan" about it, it is a fact.  Unions were under attack and jobs began declining before last year.  But it was noticed last year because that's when it began hitting the big boys' pockets and jobs in the corporations. <br>  <br>  And as for giving more to education...it depends on where you give it.  A school in the Bronx couldn't afford computers while a school in your district probably has computers for every student.  <br>  <br>  And Clinton didn't cause the housing collapse.  It happened on Bush's watch.  He ignored the signs just like he ignored all the intelligence on 9/11, the intelligence on the mines and suicide bombing plans of the terrorists, the fact that there were no WMDs in Iraq and the intelligence that suicide bombers might use planes to hit the Twin Towers.

bARPX1auaa	Early in his presidency I supported him...then I discovered the principles that outline freedom and was able to see through the fog.<br>  <br>  THE CREED OF FREEDOM<br>  <br>  INTRINSIC NATURE OF RIGHTS<br>       I believe that only individuals have rights, not the collective group; that these rights are intrinsic to each individual, not granted by the state; for if the state has the power to grant them, it also has the power to deny them, and that is incompatible with personal liberty.<br>       I believe that a just government derives its power solely from the governed. Therefore, the state must never presume to do anything beyond what individual citizens also have the right to do. Otherwise, the state is a power unto itself and becomes the master instead of the servant of society.<br>  <br>  SUPREMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL<br>       I believe that one of the greatest threats to freedom is to allow any group, no matter its numeric superiority, to deny the rights of the minority; and that one of the primary functions of just government is to protect each individual from the greed and passion of the majority.<br>  <br>  FREEDOM OF CHOICE<br>       I believe that desirable social and economic objectives are better achieved by voluntary action than by coercion of law. I believe that social tranquility and brotherhood are better achieved by tolerance, persuasion, and the power of good example than by coercion of law. I believe that those in need are better served by charity, which is the giving of one's own money, than by welfare, which is the giving of other people's money through coercion of law.<br>  <br>  EQUALITY UNDER LAW<br>       I believe that all citizens should be equal under law, regardless of their national origin, race, religion, gender, education, economic status, life style, or political opinion. Likewise, no class should be given preferential treatment, regardless of the merit or popularity of its cause. To favor one class over another is not equality under law.<br>  <br>  PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT<br>       I believe that the proper role of government is negative, not positive; defensive, not aggressive. It is to protect, not to provide; for if the state is granted the power to provide for some, it must also be able to take from others, and once that power is granted, there are those who will seek it for their advantage. It always leads to legalized plunder and loss of freedom. If government is powerful enough to give us everything we want, it is also powerful enough to take from us everything we have. Therefore, the proper function of government is to protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens; nothing more. That government is best which governs least.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I'm not ready to judge yet.  My negative emotions are still too strong.  I think that in time I might be kinder to him.

And no matter what Obama's security clearance was before the election, as soon as he was inaugurated, it changed to the top level.  You also have to remember on what basis security clearance is denied to people.  During the Nixon administration, you could get your clearance revoked if you attended a protest rally or spoke out against the government.  Security clearances are just as politicized as all the other things in government.  The singer who used to be Cat Stevens can't get a passport, simply because he converted to Islam.

NnsizqH2aa	You'll likely take a temporary demotion, to be honest.<br>  <br>  Both the Navy and Air Force like to demote prior service guys one to two pay grades while they go through A-school and Tech school. It's kind of hard for some E6 to be teaching and giving orders to a guy of equal rank, after all. So, the AF may demote you to E3 or E4 until you complete Tech school, then immediately have you complete requirements for E-5 when you hit your first unit. The Navy will likely demote you to E3 until you complete A-school, at which time you will promptly be promoted to E4. That should even be in your conract, as it was in mine so long ago, "guaranteed promotion to E-4 upon completion of A-school" After that, you're subject to the unit and service for advancement testing.<br>  <br>  Oh, that's one big difference you'll have to get ready for. The Navy actually tests people for rank, instead of sending them before those BS panel interviews. It's based more on your quarterly evals and proven knowledge than on how well you wear your uniform and answer verbal questions about crap that has nothing to do with your job. The Air Force has a different way, which I'm not familiar with.<br>  <br>  Do the research. To me, the Army is the worst of the services, full of some of the worst characters I ever encountered.

You just need to make sure that you have an open mind and realize what you are going in for and going to expect.<br>  <br>  I think that the training and education benefits you can expect could put you in a good position for later on.<br>  <br>  If you choose not to pursue the military full time...don't forget about reserves which can still net you some education benefits, or look into www.usajobs.com.  They have federal employment and I believe student internships as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|R8JgmouBaa	carry on with the college if you can. should you get a decent qualification from the college you can go into the Army (after passing out of training) as a Sergeant straight away much means more money!!. read through the Army websites (careers and the main army website), youll find everything you want to know there.|`|WVpqoupraa	Don't do it dude, go to school and have a family, in the military your just a number and get treated like crap. You will go to war and your friends will die or be maimed, youll come home and resent your old friends for caring about texting, the next party, and how their abs look. meanwhile you cry yourself to sleep thinking about all the horrible things you've seen for a war the public doesn't even support and your mind is permanently scarred from all the death and destruction and disregard for human life you've seen. At least this is my experience.|`|KhiWV0Q0aa	hell yea, armys a good choice because if you have potential you can make it far + its a secure job no chance of been made redundant, they teach you how to look after yourself ,you will make friends as close as brothers ,and everyday will be different , you will travel the world and see things that others wont . sp yea armys good :D|`|RyFCRcIUaa	The Army will give you more training and on the job experience in your chosen field!<br>  YOU can also get your certification or license as an electrician!<br>  while in the Army!<br>  <br>  plus all your GI Bill benefits.|`|fyWbMXOHaa	Only join the military if you really want to. If you join for any other reason you will be miserable!|`|zB7Hl7x2aa	might want to consider who your commander -n- chief will be.go to AMY PROCTER,she has a clip on how our troops feel about him compared to our last commander-n-Chief.|`|NnsizqH2aa	Your apprenticeship will NOT be continued in the military. To be honest, most civilian companies do not recognize what we do in the service, which is why we often have to use government moeny to retrain in whatever field we learned to love in the service.<br>  <br>  Two friends of mine were electronics technicians from two different services, one from the Navy and one from the Army. The Navy guy reached E6 and TAUGHT electronics and electrical theory at A-school for several years, but was told he would have to go back to college or vocational school to be able to do the same job in the civilian world. The Army guy reached E7 and supervised platoons of up to 40 men that also repaired electronics, but was also told that he could not return to the field in civvy-land without going back to school. Another friend of mine was also an electronics tech with the Coast Guard up to E5, did computer repair after switching to the Army up to E6, and then still had to pay money for a training program in the civilian world.<br>  <br>  If the govt really wanted to cut back on spending, one of the first things they would do is force recognition of military training. It makes no sense for the govt to pay for these guys to be trained while in the service, and then have 60% of them require more govt money just to learn the exact same job in the civilian world. I understand retraining infantrymen and scouts and such, but why technical fields? Why pay twice for the exact same training and knowledge area?<br>  <br>  In my own personal experience, I came out of the service after having done electronics on missiles and radars. My training was not recognized by either colleges or apprenticeships. I entered an apprenticeship program for about 6 months, long enough to see a guy with a bachelors in Industrial Electronics and 5 years field experience in the apprenticeship getting paid less than someone with less training, less field time and no college. That kind of thing made me run back to the service ASAP!<br>  <br>  There's too much division and competition in the civilian world. It's all about capitalism and making money, which modern schools have fallen in line with. That's why colleges and voc-schools won't recognize each other, nor recognize apprenticeship programs. It's also why different apprenticeship programs from different unions and such won't recognize the time and training from other such programs.<br>  <br>  I don't want to discourage you, but I do want to be truthful. I applaud you for considering the service, but I want to make sure that you make the decision with your eyes wide open. Nothing is more disappointing than to expect one thing and to be given something completely different later, as many vets can tell you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  .|`|Bo0iJFFkaa	The Army is a good choice right now since the economy isn't doing very well. The only problem for you that you might find is that you might not get the job you want. It just depends on what you want out of the Army. Just think you are going to get a pay check every two weeks and don't have to worry if you are going to lose your job the next day.|`|no6FrkEzaa	it's ur choice. if ur willing 2 risk ur life 4 ur country then do it. if not then think about it coz u could be more of a danger 2 ur mates and urself if u r not really up 4 it. u gotta just think bout it.<br>  Good luck.|`|Xwg2BotRaa	the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will be quite keen to hear from you.  Training is excellent and, if the life suits you, it can be good fun as well.|`|soz1f8uOaa	The army is one of the only secure jobs you can get right now, so if you want a job where you can work for years then join up, serving your country is the best feeling you can get and also you will make a lot of friends there, those are the pros, there are not really much cons to it, there is the obvious risk of getting killed, but the army train you up so that will not be as likely to happen.<br>  Definitely join up, and if you do good luck.<br>  Hope that helped.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Maybe with your field you should consider the Navy. It has a great electrical field and you will be marketable after you initial tour.<br>   There have only been a couple of answers below that have been positive. Just remember, you have to want it, nothing is forced on you in the military, you test and you choose what job you want, and if one is not available of your liking then you dont join, simple as that. just make sure that you want to apply yourself. <br>   And as far as tax payers picking up the tab, those in the military pay taxes also. Imagine this country without a military ! just seek the positive advice, be a leader. Good Luck and GOD Speed !|`|LRv8SA4Vaa	It's your choice, you'll have to sacrifice alot of important things in your life, I don't know why people still join the army, it's not like it's World War 2 or anything.|`|5pioWG30aa	As others have said....only join the Army if you are willing to serve in the Armed Forces. The Army is not just any other job, you may have to serve in combat. The Army cannot promise you will get the MOS ( job) you signed up for.  <br>  <br>  The US Army is an excellent place to go because you'll get a job, housing, medical, food, and a chance to travel. You will get lots of chances to do things you've never heard of before. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|kg3wV0Czaa	Joining the military is something that you should only do when you really want to do it.<br>  If you join and you aren't motivated by it, then you won't like it and will be stuck doing something that you don't want to do for the next 4 years.|`|l1qNr8gQaa	Only join if you are definitely going to get an apprenticeship don't let them persuade you to take something else.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Go for it<br>  <br>  Royal Engineers Electrician<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/career/674.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/ca...</a><br>  <br>  The Role:<br>  <br>  Electricians are mainly concerned with electrical installation work, power generation and distribution.

9YOXpVM0aa	It's very hard to immigrate to one of those countries without an education and some skills.  It would be a lot easier for them to move within the EU where they don't need a work permit but it's still not advisable to move anywhere unless they can find a job first.  Sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side even if it might look that way.<br>  <br>  It would be best for them to look for a job elsewhere in Ireland or in the UK, then they don't have language problems to deal with too.  The Netherlands and Denmark have pretty low unemployment still but it would still be hard to get a job there with no skills and no language.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	you cannot immigrate for economical reasons <br>  <br>  and you cannot immigrate because your family members are NOT skilled.|`|AA10045620	I am sorry, but the job market of any kind in the U.

Also, unemployment in the US is now at a 25 year high, so it's really the wrong time to be thinking of moving there.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	America is in the midst of a depression. Millions of people are unemployed, thanks to a string of horrible leadership. It's probably not the best idea to think about coming here either.

He has a plan to save us that actually has a chance of working. Our country is going downhill fast. But slowly... he is pulling us out of the ground. Or at least trying! I am very very satisfied with our new president. And the fact that he is black is all the better! It shows we have finally come to a point where we aren't focused on skin color and more so on making this a better country for us all. We have a real chance at becoming a great country once again.

What about your physician or MD thirty years ago? If they referred you to psychiatric treatment back then, there should be a record of it. What about military service? Did you try to enlist and denied because of your mental condition?<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to consult with someone to assist with your appeal.

iRg1vyHcaa	UK answer.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it's not as straight forward as the others have stated. Your friend can still be reported for summons for the offence. If the Officer was called away to something more serious he may have written the registration down and can pursue a prosecution within the next six months.<br>  <br>  I have to admit this is highly unlikely and it sounds very much like your friend has been given a verbal warning and let off with it. It is still a possibility that he could be prosecuted though.<br>  <br>  Personally I wouldn't worry.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	No - if they let it go last night, its done.  But you can bet that policeman will have made a mental note of his car - and will notice it again!|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	As long as he didn't fill anything out or sign anything, he got lucky and got a warning. Was there any form of red light camera there?|`|8hAhmlJjaa	Legally if you are anywhere within the intersection when the light changes from yellow to red, you have violated the red light.  He could have given you a ticket.  Instead he gave you a verbal warning.  You will not receive anything further on this.  It is over. Learn from it.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	You'll have got the message, the policeman used a bit of discretion and left it at that.  There'll be nothing more.  Doubtless you got the message just as well as you would have done if he'd given you a ticket.|`|oFcrglxzaa	relax, the driver got off with a warning and it was the driver who was at fault not you so it's a done deal|`|BuP60uAtaa	Nothing happened and nothing will. Your friend is lucky, but that was a warning.  When he's driving he needs to pay better attention to the signals.  It is considered to be a red light if the light was yellow when you entered the intersection because the light changes within 30 seconds and it takes longer than that for a car to completely leave the intersection.|`|jaZazNzZaa	If they didn't take his details, (name, address) or take information from his licence, then no, he won't be booked.|`|AA10250918	if he let your friend go, he has nothing to worry about. You've never been pulled over before, have you? lol|`|bQmeimWMaa	Hi there.I was done for this last year he would have got 3 points on licence and a fine of ￡60.I also went through amber not red but the police man was not as forgiving as yours.I was going to contest it in court but was advised not to as it was my word against his and I could have got a higher fine so I let it go.<br>  If his details were not taken then he will not be fined or done for it.They have to tell you there and then if they will take it further so don't worry

LSTgcRfSaa	Hi Kaz<br>  <br>  Within our judicial system there is a broad range of measures by which we can mete out sentences. As a director of a community based restorative justice project I believe where possible CBRJ should be used as it is an holistic approach to addressing offences and helps bring healing and closure for victims, the offender and the wider community which may have been affected by the offence.|`|IWlPfk1raa	Too stay within the boundaries of our Constitution|`|O5KOwhovaa	Corporal and capital punishment should be reintroduced.|`|27vNdc4baa	Hey Kaz<br>  <br>  Interestin Q. This involves many theroies and opinions.<br>  <br>  I'm of the belief that serious offenders like murders and rapists should be sentenced to death. Having such people in jail for years and years does nothing but make them more angry and more likely to join a gang and when they out commit more crimes!<br>  <br>  However, i dont like the idea of killing people. But it just feels wrong to let someone live while they have killed someone else.<br>  <br>  In other words, I believe that the punnish should fit the crime.<br>  <br>  I also think that criminals should be forced to work and study while in jail. Give the a better chance of making a life after jail instead of going back to crime|`|OxFzFDgVaa	geve the criminals the punnishment they deserve.<br>  for me, i think murders shouln't be let out o\in the open. i think they should be locked aways 4-eva!|`|n13rCdZtaa	In my opinion, we should give longer jail sentences.

Also, Socialism is a failure.  <br>  <br>  DTG|`|AA11313983	I would imagine its for the same reason that President Obama uses President Bush's socialist policies as a scare tactic.  The difference, of course, is that Obama thinks that the fix for socialism is more socialism.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Not "fearmongering", just presenting the fact that the bigger and more powerful the government, the more of the economy it controls, the less freedom the people truly have.<br>  <br>  This was the reason why the Constitution created a very specific and limited government - to prevent the creation of the government beast which takes everything.<br>  <br>  I like the Constitution, and Socialism is contrary to the principles of individual rights, liberties and economic freedoms that were my birthright under that document.<br>  <br>  I don't see that the European model is worth emulating. They are just undergoing a slow death with their ever-growing socialism.|`|midmBgJJaa	Oh, just something that Thomas Jefferson once wrote which seems startling for its contrast to Obama and the Democratic  Congress' current spending. <br>  <br>  "We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.<br>  We must make our election between economy and liberty<br>  or profusion and servitude.<br>  If we run into such debt, as that we must be taxed in our meat and<br>  in our drink, in our necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and<br>  our amusements, for our calling and our creeds...<br>  [we will] have no time to think,<br>  no means of calling our miss-managers to account<br>  but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves<br>  to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow-sufferers...<br>  And this is the tendency of all human governments.<br>  A departure from principle in one instance<br>  becomes a precedent for [another ]...<br>  till the bulk of society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery...<br>  And the fore-horse of this frightful team is public debt.<br>  Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression."|`|G49lKR56aa	Because socialism is the first and foremost important act democrats have on their hidden agenda!

Rush doesn't want America to fail, Rush wants Obama to fail in his desire to implement socialism in America.<br>  <br>  Rush and the other talkers aren't fear mongering. they are expressing their prediction of America's future based on the failed and failing socialist attempts of the past. every time a government begins punishing citizens for working, and rewarding citizens for not working, the overall quality of life under that government goes down.<br>  <br>  but, speaking of fear mongering....what do you call Obama's statement that the country will fall into an unrecoverable collapse if congress doesn't pass his 1+ Trillion dollar stimulus package?<br>  <br>  remember, the government that has the power to give anything to you, also has the power to take everything from you.<br>  <br>  and JT....socialism is the step between capatalism and communism. research the how each of those three systems work economically, and perhaps you'll understand why capitalist americans do not want to start that march towards communism (and the eventual dictatorship that always follows)<br>  <br>  the Nazi party were socialists that hated communists..and we see how that turned out.|`|axHyoVqGaa	"Why do so many GOP members use Socialism as a fear mongering tactic?"<br>  <br>  It's not fear mongering if there is actually something to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  "The U.S. is by far the most conservative of all the Western world, Obama is just bringing us closer to the proper balance of Socialism and Capitalism."<br>  <br>  Who the hell is Obama to decide what is or isn't the proper balance of Socialism and Capitalism?  We have a Constitution for a reason and he needs to start following it like he pledged to do when he took the oath of office.  If this country needs to become more socialistic in nature, then the people can make that decision and change the Constitution accordingly.   <br>  <br>  "Do they truly want to see this great nation fail?"<br>  <br>  Did you pay attention during history class?  Capitalism is what has made this country the number one superpower in an amazingly short amount of time.  As our nation has become more socialistic in nature, the overall level of achievement has slowed dramatically and it is why we find ourselves in the situation that we are in today.  If you want this nation to succeed, then we need to get back to what made us great in the first place and that sure as hell wasn't socialism!|`|0aXRDfOLaa	There's a difference between ultra-capitalism and what the Americans call the socialism.<br>  Ultra-capitalism is the source of the financial crisis.<br>  Countries like France and Sweden aren't socialist nor communist, but their economy is less capitalist than in the USA.<br>  <br>  Since France suffers less in the financial crisis, that in spite of a huge public spending its economy is equal to the UK's one, that its healthcare is the best in the world, maybe the USA should be a little "less" capitalist.

daQ5aoOoaa	H? Chí Minh  listen (help·info) (name pronounced [hò? t?ǐm???]) (May 19, 1890 – September 2, 1969) was a Vietnamese Communist revolutionary and statesman who was Prime Minister (1946–1955) and President (1946–1969) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam).<br>  <br>  Ho led the Viet Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the communist-governed Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu. He lost political power inside North Vietnam in the late 1950s, but remained as the highly visible figurehead president until his death. He was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century,[1] while the former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Early life <br>  1.1 First sojourn in France <br>  2 In the USA <br>  3 In England <br>  4 Political education in France <br>  5 In the Soviet Union and China <br>  6 Independence movement <br>  6.1 Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam <br>  7 Becoming president <br>  8 Death <br>  9 Legacy <br>  10 Quotes <br>  11 Notes <br>  12 Further reading <br>  12.1 Essays <br>  12.2 Biography <br>  12.3 The Viet Minh, NLF & the Democratic Republic of Vietnam <br>  12.4 The War in Vietnam <br>  12.5 American Foreign Policy <br>  13 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Early life<br>  H? Chí Minh was born, as Nguy?n Sinh Cung, in 1890 in Hoàng Trù Village, his mother's hometown. From 1895, he grew up in his paternal hometown of Kim Liên Village, Nam ?àn District, Ngh? An Province, Vietnam. He had three siblings, his sister B?ch Liên (or Nguy?n Th? Thanh), a clerk in the French Army, his brother Nguy?n Sinh Khiêm (or Nguy?n T?t ??t), a geomancer and traditional herbalist, and another brother (Nguy?n Sinh Nhu?n) who died in his infancy. Following Confucian traditions, at the age of 10 his father named him Nguy?n T?t Thành (Nguy?n the Accomplished).<br>  <br>  Ho's father, Nguy?n Sinh S?c, was a Confucian scholar, small time teacher and later an imperial magistrate in a small remote district Binh Khe (Qui Nhon). He was later demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after receiving 100 canes as punishment[2]. This however was merely a pretense by the French-controlled government to get rid of Sac, whose sons had been involved in nationalist, Anti-French activities at the Duc Thanh school, founded in 1907 by patriotic scholars who hoped to imitate the success of the Hanoi Free School. Deferent to his father, Ho received a French education, attended lycée in Hu?, the alma mater of his later disciples, Ph?m V?n D?ng and V? Nguyên Giáp.

Chí Minh left Vietnam on a French steamer, Amiral Latouche-Tréville, working as a kitchen helper. Arriving in Marseille, France, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School but his application was rejected.[3][unreliable source?] During his stay, he worked as a cleaner, waiter, and film retoucher. H? spent most of his free time in public libraries reading history books and newspapers to familiarize himself with Western society and politics.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the USA<br>  In 1912, again working as the cook's helper on a ship, H? Chí Minh traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he lived in New York (Harlem) and Boston, where he worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. He worked in menial jobs and later claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in Brooklyn between 1917 and 1918, and during this time he may have heard Marcus Garvey speak in Harlem. It is believed that while in the United States he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook.[4]<br>  <br>  <br>  In England<br>  At various points between 1913 and 1919, H? lived in West Ealing, west London, and later in Crouch End, Hornsey, north London. He is reported to have worked as a chef at the Drayton Court Hotel, on The Avenue, West Ealing.[5] It is claimed that Ho trained as a pastry chef under the legendary French master, Escoffier, at the Carlton Hotel in the Haymarket, Westminster, but there is no evidence to support this.[4] However, the wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission, which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a Blue Plaque, stating that H? worked there in 1913 as a waiter.[6]<br>  <br>  <br>  Political education in France<br>  From 1919–1923, while living in France, H? Chí Minh embraced communism, through his friend Marcel Cachin (SFIO).[citation needed] Ho claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917 but French police only have documents of his arrival in June 1919.[4] Following World War I, under the name of Nguy?n ái Qu?c (Nguyen the Patriot), he petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but was ignored.

He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. <br>  <br>  This is a quote that I think is one of his most revealing statements that makes this quite clear:<br>  <br>  "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<br>  <br>  o_O|`|eu6UQElYaa	I think the basic idea was for Germany to take over everything.

This is one example of how the Government is the engine of the economy.  Let's take the Military Industrial complex (so you can understand)...it creates private sector jobs and was the primary method that Ronald Regan grew the economy during his administration.  <br>  <br>  When the Feds, through the DOD places an order for a weapon system...a jet plane, a gun, a tank and ect.  <br>  <br>  This order is placed through private sector contractors.  They hire people to create the product and place component orders with their supplier base.  The supplier base then hires more people to fill the component orders.  These parts are shipped and further logistics are needed to create more jobs to assemble the final product.  This job creation is called the multiplier effect.  <br>  <br>  Weapon systems are constant being created and stockpiled if there is no war.  Stockpiled weapons are sold off to foreign governments to which is not really known to the public, but it happens.  <br>  <br>  Profits are made from these weapon systems, which increase the value of the investments of the shareholders.

What's wrong with that? They have to make a product or provide a service and they can't do that without employees and that equals jobs.<br>  <br>  That way the government would be releasing billions of dollars into the economy immediately, without having to borrow a trillion dollars. There would be no capital outlay from the public coffers and the tax base would start reaping the benefits right away.<br>  <br>  2) The only way out of recession is to create jobs in the private sector. New government jobs would be counterproductive to the economy, only expanding the already bloated and largely unnecessary national debt.<br>  <br>  3) Do not give billions of dollars to companies that will eventually go broke anyway. If their obligations were undoable, as painful as it would be, it would be better to let them fail now. That way maybe they could reorganize and prosper.<br>  <br>  4) Suspend the personal income tax for a year. Put money in ordinary citizen's pockets because they'll spend it on TV's and cars and shoes and barbeque and that's what makes the business world go around.<br>  <br>  5) Shrink government, there is too much repetition in government, too much political patronage. The government does not require production and efficiency and has so many rules and regulations that it's almost impossible to fire an unproductive person.<br>  <br>  6) Institute a flat tax, a simple one-page form that tells you what percentage of the dollars you earn have to go to the government. Do away with the internal revenue service, which is an inefficient, overstaffed dinosaur, which could be cut by probably 50% or more by a flat tax.<br>  <br>  Give us a simple tax form, what "We The People" can understand and fill out for ourselves.<br>  <br>  7) Do not allow cost overruns on government contracts. Keep a portion of the price until the job is finished, on time and on budget. If it is not, withhold the money and pay it to some other company to finish the project.<br>  <br>  8) Deport illegal aliens period.|`|jVUEohsNaa	Yes, let the banks fail, let the losers lose their homes, cut off all welfare, no more free lunches!<br>  <br>  Let the free enterprise system WORK... no more bailouts of anybody!<br>  <br>  NOBAMA!<br>  <br>  I'M MAD AS HELL AND NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao3FuGEGcU8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao3FuGEGc...</a>|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Capitalism and the free market system take care of itself.

The rulings of arbitration tribunals are binding in law, provided that both parties in the dispute agree to give it the power to rule on their case. <br>  <br>  JEWISH Beth Din courts operate under the same provision in the Arbitration Act and resolve civil cases, ranging from divorce to business disputes.

You can have what is known as a "flag" on your file. This means any time an application for credit is made and they check your credit history, a flag will appear on your file. It doesn't mean you won't be able to get credit, it just means the credit companies will contact you to make sure you are the person applying for the credit and not someone else.|`|DwoR8PnPaa	I used to work in a department of a mortgage lender in the fraud prevention and help of identity theft victims where a fraud loan was on their account.  If you did not report this to the police, do so.  There are identity theft packets and information available at the Federal Trade Comission website. And also another article at the state of CA as identity theft is under the state attorney general privacy act.  <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/idtheft/" rel="nofollow">http://ag.ca.gov/idtheft/</a><br>  <br>  Many times we would see identity theft victims made up of composite information.  A persons name and driver's license, but another person's social and home address and yet another piece for work and false wages. Don't be fooled into thinking they don't have enough, they don't even have to come after you for your social #, they can put your name and license with a picture and social of someone elses. <br>  <br>  A fraud alert is good, but also watch for multiple inquiries coming in, but that is your social.  If they are not using that but perhaps your name and driver's license you need a report into the police department.  That's just as bad.  You want a report in, just in case something happens.  You don't want to be connected to anything someone may do.<br>  <br>  Criminal identity theft is worse than financial as if a person assumes your name and DL# and commits a crime if you are stopped the cops don't ask for your social #, they as for your DL#.  Get the picture?  You could be spending some hours in jail if you don't prove who you are. Look up criminal identity theft as well, and medical identity theft is another issue, it's not always connected to 'your' social, they have a piece to build a composite person, and that's enough.
RNj2on9aaa	I feel sorry for the future generations, they are the ones who will have to shoulder the burdens this administration will be passing on to them. History shows time and again that governmental spending does nothing to "stimulate" an economy. All it does is depress an economy.<br>  <br>  What I believe we will see is a further decline in the stock market, which will result in even greater job losses. This in turn will cause temporary deflation as businesses struggle to maintain some level of business, for example, stores and restaurants will lower prices in an effort to keep their businesses afloat. When that fails we will see hyperinflation. I am going to predict we will see double digit inflation reaching upward to 23% by 2012.<br>  <br>  During that time we will see people trying to reclaim their independence. People will start gardening to raise their own fruits and vegetables in an effort to lower their food bills. I further predict we will see the beginning of the end for the BIG BOX stores and a return to main street as people will start demanding accountability.<br>  <br>  Government never has been the answer to the ills of it's people, this was recognized by the founding fathers when they wrote the "Declaration of Independence, The Bill of Rights, and (probably the most important document written since the Bible) The Constitution. They tried to limit the power of the government.<br>  <br>  As for what Student mentioned about "family planning", abortion is NOT family planning . Family planning includes education, and an understanding of the reproductive process. Family planning includes education regarding the use of contraception and the prevention of pregnancy. Once your pregnant planning time is over in that regard because now a new life is added to the mix. And for those that want to argue the point of when life begins and that abortions are ok should defend the criminal charged with murder when a pregnant woman loses her baby as the results of another's actions, because by the standards they have said that fetus really isn't alive and you can't murder something that is not living.<br>  <br>  Pro choice should mean using contraception, vasectomy, tubal ligation, or good old fashioned abstinence. Not abortion.<br>  <br>  Also it is immoral and unethical to take money from those opposed to abortion to support abortion. Again this was something our founding fathers faced .... taxation without representation.<br>  <br>  So I guess you could say I am embarassed because our country has lost it's way.  As a former member of the armed services I support your right to disagree with me and I hope anyone who disagrees with me will extend the same courtesy.|`|SUyLcWpNaa	If you voted for him this is what you wanted.

I once met a Chindit at a wedding.  they fought in the British Army in the jungles of Burma in WW2.  I said to him , why was there so much poor morale among the Americans in Vietnam, and he put it down to poor discipline, which I must say I encountered among GIs in America at this time.  Drug use was so bad they had to disarm the sentries on the gates in the Army Camp near me.  Also, the average American soldier was only 19, and they got treated very badly on their return to the USA. But in fact, all soldiers suffer post traumatic stress.  My dad was at Sword Beach in 1944, and he still screams in his sleep now.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Because fighting and killing and witnessing death and destruction in a searing jungle with no clear idea of why the war you have been drafted to fight is taking place or what objective needs to be accomplished in order to win it, would tend to cause some mental problems.|`|OcnsptnPaa	Several reasons. There was no support of the troops from people in USA. Drug use was rampant. Agent Orange. The torture techniques that took place in the Hanoi Hilton.|`|8Iy39btEaa	It's because people had no idea where the Vietcong were. They could be anywhere. For all the soldiers knew their best friend could have been in the Vietcong. This caused extreme paranoia and eventually, madness. As well as this a lot of the soldiers turned to drugs in the Vietnamese war. Good Morning Vietnam is a good film to watch if your still wondering about the question.|`|qIT2aTmVaa	During Vietnam, we sent a lot of young men over there that weren't mentally prepared for what the were going to see and do. It was violence that many never imagined and unforgettable scenes of combat and casualties. Some men came back and were able to block it out and resume a normal life, but others were not so lucky and those things still haunt them.|`|soz1f8uOaa	Because, people were seeing mass slaughter every day and most of them were young teenagers that had the choice to go to jail or Vietnam.

AA10287176	A mixture of both. Some people claim the supposed right of states to create any law they want, but it is pretty clear both that this is not the case and should not be the case. (It is not the case because state laws can be struck down for violating the U.S. Constitution; it should not be the case because, well, look at some of the past manifestations of absolute state rights: slavery and segregation.)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, of course the country functions much more effectively if each state is able to create laws to deal with its own particular issues.  <br>  <br>  It is important to remember that any absolute power granted to a political entity is going to violate the idea of check and balance. In your question you pointed out that state self-determination helps to check the power of the federal government. It is just as true that the federal government is needed to check the power of states, and a system where states are not subject to this balance of power is likely not going to be a free one (see the above examples).|`|lAsbD5B7aa	In order to be a member of the United States, the States still must comply with Federal laws. For example, they cannot take away the right to vote.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	I do but apparently the Bush administration did not.  California had to take them to court (successfully) to keep them from interfering in our legislative process with executive orders.|`|sUiUJWiSaa	Only partially!

6Fsliwlhaa	Not going to happen, North Korea isn't that stupid.  There are almost 30,000 US troops in South Korea right now and if any of them were killed in that attack the counterattack the US would fire at them would put a crater where Pyongyang used to be.|`|NnsizqH2aa	I don't know where this idea came from, but I'll try to answer it anyway.<br>  <br>  Well, since we have so many military installations over there, including some 30,000 troops in South Korea, we won't just be standing by doing nothing. To do so would allow our own troops to die.<br>  <br>  Now, as for why our nation gets involved in so many different things, it is because we exist in GLOBAL market. If we allow things to get out of hand in other parts of the world, we suffer here also. Plus, the military typically is one of the most stable markets in the economy, constantly spending money to buy more and repair equipment every year. In fact, a unit literally "rents" its equipment year by year. (My last unit, my first CO there was forced out of command a year early because he had spent so little on training and maintenance the year before that they cut us back on funds, so much so that we were looking at losing half of our Avenger systems the following year).<br>  <br>  Plus, we have allies in other parts of the world. Japan is an ally, both politically and economically. Japan is right next to Korea, so we have to maintain peace around them as much as we can, especially since they just recently came out of a treaty with us that required that they not maintain their own military forces for 50 years. (I'm sure you heard all about that little WW2 conflict and our dropping of those two nukes over there before we created that long treaty requirement).<br>  <br>  "No man is an island." Nor is any nation able to exist by itself. <br>  <br>  Korea has pacts with China, which we owe money to right now (don't ask me why, since they were still in hock to us). So, if the political power structure over there suddenly changes, our nation could find itself beholding to global extortion by China (which is already a considerable enough threat by itself).<br>  <br>  Read some Liddel Hart, a military and political historian. He had an excellent grasp on these things.<br>  *|`|nDvrN6Qgaa	Oh god no!  Of course we will do something.  Hilary will hop on an airplane and go over there to negotiate with them and the president will decide how to buy North Korea off like Clinton did in the 90's.  And of course SecDef will be tasked to come up with an exit strategy just in case.  Well that's my read anyway, good luck to you.<br>  ...Mike S...|`|YRRXtVXeaa	WON'T HAPPEN: IDIOT!|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	Why do we have to get involved in every other countries conflicts?|`|pss8LblLaa	It is highly unlikely that N. Korea would fire nukes at anyone.  The people who are in power in that country live a very comfortable life.  They have no real fear of losing this comfortable existence due to internal actions because they have their own people very well subdued via fear or brainwashing.  The only threat to those in power losing their lifestyle is via international intervention or someone in the upper power echelon "removing" them.  If any of the people in power gave the command to fire nukes then someone else in that power tier would probably elminate them since firing their nukes at another country would invite international intervention thus terminating the comfortable lifestyle for the entire group that is in power.  The only way they fire nukes at anyone is if someone attacks them first or one of them goes off his rocker and executes a launch command without intervention from one of the other people in power.|`|WVpqoupraa	The end is near I know it HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAA|`|pxC8C729aa	Yea...lol we will just sit there and gaze...wee have nothing to do with other countries except for the fact we are in war with the Iraqies but hey,we citezens can't do anything about anything in other countries|`|1IzphjzKaa	real smart? where do you get your facts? this question is not to smart|`|bz6g1OcCaa	i wonder if like n.korea gets mad at us then launches a nuke but we intercept it and make s.korea an island|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Are you the worlds biggest tool?  9/11 led to no retaliation?

neWbgaHCaa	Your best source of information will be a recruiter. Set up appointments with each recruiter and ask them these questions. Get web sites that will give you the information. <br>  I think that the Navy has the fastest promotion rate of the Armed Services. I started as an E-1 and made E-5 in four years. That is not the same for every rate in the navy. Every rate fluctuates on their advancement speed. If you kept your nose clean and motivated then you could make E-6 in your first 4 years.<br>  If you made E-6 in your first 4 years then you would be a shoe in to go to OCS. A shipmate of mine made E-6 in 3.5years and was accepted to the officer program. They sent him to college with full E-6 pay for 3 years. He got his degree and now when I see him I am required to salute him. <br>  Another thing that you should know is that when you sign your enlistment contract it is for 8 years. You will serve the first 3-4 active and the remainder of the 8 years on inactive reserves. The government owns you for 8 years.|`|3xTNOevjaa	First off, congrats on making your decision to join the military. <br>  I would recommand you to goto the Navy since you have much better options there. Your GPA is great along with your ACT score. You'd probably get around 90s if you take the ASVAB. <br>  <br>  Since your an eagle scout, you'll go in as an E-3. Promotion depends on your Rate(job), if you go into a nuclear field, you'll get to an E-5 within 2 years. <br>  <br>  Onto the GI Bill. You need to serve active duty for 3 years before you get FULL tuition. Yes, you get full tuition according to the 9/11 "NEW" GI Bill congress passed. All of your tuition will be covered upto a certain amount of college courses. <br>  <br>  Navy's lowest contract is 4 years, max is 6. But you can always re-enlist. CG contracts I believe is 4 years also. And about the bonuses, you only get them when you sign up for a job that they are looking for. As for Navy, nuclear field jobs get those kind of bonuses. <br>  <br>  As for your dream sheet, many say that you shouldn't rely on it. Most of the time, you do not goto the place you put on your dream sheet. The branch puts you wherever they need you. <br>  <br>  Since your planning to become an Officer, I would really recommand you to goto college and doing ROTC. If you go in as active duty and goto college after, you'll be just wasting your time. You can finish ROTC and become an officer, and go in as 2nd Lt. in the Navy. <br>  <br>  Pick your options wisely, you control your own future depending on what choices you make.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|HCFPHlF4aa	I could try to answer all these questions but they should be left for a professional like a recuriter. <br>  <br>  My dad wanted me to become a CG officer but when I looked into it I found it is extremely hard without a very certain high level degree to become an officer without going to the CG Academy. <br>  <br>  I recently join the Army Reserve and asked around here and the information wasn't always correct. <br>  <br>  Hope I was somewhat helpful.

You'll do a few exercises in your underware.  You'll drop your panties... bend over and spread your cheeks so they can check you out down there.

Without even starting a left/right argument, do this:<br>  Announce that you will not let the Bush Tax expire.  Despite whether or not you agree with that, only a fool would argue the fact that investors would agree.<br>  <br>  Lower capital gains taxes.  Personally I would argue suspend them completely for five years.  <br>  <br>  Pull cap and trade off the table.  It's another comoflauged redistribution, and the market doesn't like it.<br>  <br>  Lower your budget to numbers we can forsee paying back. Again, whether or not you agree with it, investors don't<br>  <br>  Repeal "mark to market".  It's a method of trying to make your balance sheet "more honest".  This was repealed in the 40?s by FDR, and wasn't re-instated until last year by Bush.  This would enable businesses to show some of the stimulus money they have already recieved on the balance sheet, making investors more likely to jump in.<br>  <br>  Quit throwing good money after bad.  If some of these corps. would go bankrupt, new blood would come in, buy up the pieces, and start over.  Restructuring in court would help some of these businesses restart with more viable plans.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what you believe about tax rates.  Business and investors don't want to hear it right now.  The continnuing of the market decline shows it plainly.  35% of zero = 39% of zero.  What Obama doesn't seem to understand, is that none of his agenda can occur if he doesn't keep his mouth shut, get out of the way, and let investors do their thing.  Once we get things rolling, we can debate "fair share".  Even though I never voted for the man, I thought he was smarter than this.<br>  <br>  **ADDED - This answer hasn't even been up twenty minutes, and it's already getting thumbs down.

Nobody will admit that before you can begin the "CHANGE", the economy has to start rolling.  To get it rolling you have to appease your sworn enemy, "the rich".  To do that you have to ADMIT your entire philosophy is flawed, and your (especially Obama's) egos are too big to allow that.  Nothing I said originally was insulting, or dishonest.  If you noticed, I listed problems with policy from Bush too.  It just goes to show you can't have an honest debate with a liberal, because they can't even be honest with themselves.

If you have already been charged with a DUI, unless you can prove that the charge was false there is little chance of "getting out of it".

86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Or, maybe they voted for Obama because the majority of blacks ARE actually democrats? That might explain it. They voted along their normal party lines.|`|bARPX1auaa	Voting is a civic responsibility.  If one takes that responsibility seriously, it would require a certain amount of knowledge regarding policy and government.  If their vote was cast in support of a candidate based solely on skin color, their vote was wasted.<br>  <br>  BTW- Democrats CLAIM to support human rights, but consider this:<br>  <br>  Anwsers.com defines Human Rights-  The basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, often held to include the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and equality before the law.<br>  <br>  Just how many democratic policies advocate 'equality under the law'?<br>  Affirmative Action- NO<br>  Income Tax- NO<br>  Welfare- NO<br>  stimulus programs- NO<br>  Gay Rights- NO<br>  Women's Rights- NO<br>  <br>  I say your friend is correct, and has the right to express his opinion as provided in the First Amendment.|`|Flkt4Sn6aa	Okay maybe they liked him ideas. Maybe we don't have racism hardly at all anymore. Maybe they liked the rights he offered. maybe they liked his platform. What does it matter anyways? there not racist are they. Who really gives of crap the election is over and that's just something they're gonna have to deal with. Obama one and are country is gonna get strong again. And guess what the african american people have a right to do that. You can't change their votes, it's already happened there skippy. They have a right to have there opinion and you have a right to have yours. Don't try to change the past, try to change the future.|`|tROFU72waa	You don't have a comeback because he's stating a fact, several actually.  Most people didn't know, nor care about his stance concerning a lot of things and simply voted due to his skin color.  Hard to fight the truth ain't it?|`|vPDYIkqDaa	Democrats are just looking for a handout!  Republicans actually work hard and earn money and would like to keep it! Instead, under Obama's plan to "spread the wealth" they'll be paying for the democrats laziness!|`|lEaT5q06aa	i agree with you in that they are allowed to vote for whomever they choose<br>  for whatever reason<br>  <br>  but i do believe that it was a poor choice<br>  <br>  and now we must "ride the tiger" until 4 years from now when we survey<br>  <br>  what is left of america|`|HsrCk2J1aa	blacks almost always vote predominately democrat and this is no exception. most blacks share democratic views. it was more like 90, too.

9e57750ed3c826124966326d438d7e96aa	Well, due diligence IS record keeping and quality assurance. <br>  <br>  You must be able to show that you have made sure that you and your staff have the relevant Food Hygiene certificates and training (assuming you are dealing with processed foods rather than just selling root vegetables), that the correct procedures are in place to ensure that cleanliness, dangers of cross contamination, storage temperatures, pest control and all the other dangers are monitored appropriately, plus you can trace the preparation of your product(s) (which batches of raw ingredients were used, what the processing conditions were, who did the processing and so on). Then you can claim you have ensured due diligence, but only providing you have records of all the appropriately marked check-lists, times, temperatures, forms, certificates and signatures etc.<br>  <br>  Put simply, you must have documentary proof that you have (or appear to have) taken all reasonable precautions in the preparation, packaging, storage and distribution of your product in order to claim due diligence.<br>  <br>  ISO 9000 (BS 5750) really only formalise good practice, ensuring Adherence to Standards, Traceability and Accountability. You don't need to be registered, although registration will give you greatly enhanced credibility.<br>  <br>  But that said, if you don't have any quality management then you are not giving due diligence.|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	streamline and ultra-modernize book-keeping and distribution (and logistics involved).|`|28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	Work to conform to 'industry standards' -- there are industry standards for small food businesses, aren't there?

As for whether it's discrimination, he's entitled to his opinion, but I would say, American citizens should get a higher priority in these things. Legal residents can't petition their parents at all, but US citizens can. And any legal resident can become a citizen.

The biggest radio show in world history, with 20 million listeners a day can't be wrong, and is not going away.<br>  <br>  But actually Obama will do the most to bring about the 2nd Republican Revolution, just as Bill Clinton did in the 90's, which lead to the Republicans having control of the House and Senate and electing Bush.|`|V44ARW4maa	congratulations bogus!! An intelligent question, not whining or complaining about obama. As an independent, i have been shaking my head in disgust for the right and them being stuck with the blowhard drug addict that is rush limpballs. Obviously i have low regard for rushkie, but to answer your question objectively, the right needs to collectively speak up about their displeasure with rush. Maybe calling his EIB network and his sponsers and boycotting his advertisers--when money is involved, they will listen. Personally, i find it hilarious that so much attention is given to this loser, but overall, it hurts the nation, and it hurts the republican party, especially when a majority feel as you do--rush is NOT the voice of the party, and he should just shut up. Oh, and one more thing: rush's openly hoping for obama to fail is reprehensible and makes independents like me unlikely to ever vote republikan ever again.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Rush has his view I have my own you want to dump me too. <br>  <br>  Remember one thing<br>  American Republican<br>  American Democrat<br>  <br>  Division is not a cure our politicians work for us.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	"Fellow Reps" my butt.  We are figuring out ways to dump Liberals like you.|`|Hh0PtDYKaa	I am sorry to say that you are not a Republican.  I am an independent thinker who is conservative.  I feel that Ronald Reagan was one of the best presidents we ever had.  Funny how Obama campaigned as a moderate with Reagan like promises, yet he is governing so far from the left it is scary.  My guess you are a liberal who is afraid that Rush Limbaugh is super charging conservatives all across the country.  Notice I said conservatives,  not republicans.  Believe it or not, there is a difference.  Though the vast majority of republicans are conservatives.  There are Democrats that are as well, they are referred to as blue dog democrats.  The whole point, we believe that less government is the best route, capitalism is of the utmost importance to securing independence and freedom.  Socialism and Communism are very bad for our country and it needs to be stopped.  <br>       Speak out Rush, keep hammering your point, we are listening and agree.  Pres Obama's vision for America must fail, his ideas must fail, his policies must fail, therefore this Administration's efforts must fail.  Simply put, Obama must fail if he is trying to drive our country to bigger government and socialism.  Just wait until 2010, you will see that Rush and Micheal Steele are right.  Only then can we start to heal and fix the immense damage done by this administration.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	Yes the longer Rush stays in to represent the party the more distance people who are educated and cultured want to put alot distance between the republican party and themselves. Rush is low class and very bigoted|`|jPYLP6cXaa	Yeah sure you're republican. Loser|`|AA11511852	Your name says it all.<br>  Thanks for these two points.
