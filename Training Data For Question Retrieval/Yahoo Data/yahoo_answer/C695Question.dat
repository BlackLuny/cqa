20090226130616AAqXDA3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What happened? Why is he acting like this?	So, my friend likes this guy and she's getting really upset and saying she should give up and stop trying to win him over because he doesn't respond when she talks to him anymore. She said he tilted his head at her today when she was talkign to him which I personally dont consider as ignoring her but she's getting really depressed about it and I dont know what to do. I guess you could say that over time he's been drifting away and stuff? Like we used to be friends with him and then he got more and more distant. He used to tell her he loved her everyday, and they weren't going out. Now they barely talk at all. He and his girlfriend recently broke up too, could that have anything to do with it? Help? D:      thanks for reading that haha : P   i just wanna see what other people think and make her feel better D:

20090226130826AAtpUyM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much money should my spouse contribute to household?	I owned the house we in live in free and clear before we married. How do I decide how much he should contribute? I think he should pay an amount equal to what I could rent out a room for or what he would pay for a small apt. Plus I think he should also pay half the utilities etc. He thinks he should only have to pay half the utilities and food etc. since I don't have any mortgage to pay. But I do have house insurance and property taxes which are over $7000 a year. He enjoys having a nice house but objects to paying to live here. He will say "I didn't want this big house, you did." We live in Boca Raton, Florida and all I get is $600 a month including food. What do you think?
20090226131010AA4YBhG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Awkwardness with a girl...?	Okay I was best friends with this girl. Then, like a month ago, when she got a boyfriend, she just stopped talking to me and ignored me completely. Not like impolitely, almost stopped texting me all together, not talking to me on the bus, and never wanted to hang with me. After she broke up (which she never told me about, somebody else was talking about her boyfriend and it came up), she still doesn't talk to me or hang out.   So, I ride the late bus once a week, and she's the only one that gets off at my stop  besides me. It's a long, awkward walk home because she won't talk at all or does one word answers. And walks really slow, too. I asked her about not talking to me, never really had a real answer for me... And I didn't do anything that would make her ticked off I think.   What do you think I should do about this?

20090226131318AAFedyi	Family & Relationships;Family	Please help me.. begging yall....... : (?	Well, this may take a while to get to the exact question, but please deal with me.. please....      Sorry this is so long.. but please please bear with it... please      To start off with, things have went from bad to worse to the worse it's been in a long while with my so-called dad (call him that because of how he treats me). Well, its been getting bad for the past week or so.. and yesterday driving home (still have my learners license b/c of my "dad") and I went to put up the passenger window in my truck (it's a 4-door) and my dad said he would when we got to the highway, well we did, and he starts bitching at me about putting the window down. Then he went and put the AC on high and he kept on yelling and hollering at me while I was trying to drive. [i could tell yesterday when he picked me up from school that he was already like that (he's a s.o.b alcoholic)]    Well, today we were going home and we were about half way and he goes and tells me to turn another way and purdy much go out of the way.. and I told him (nicely) that I just wanted to get home from school, and then he starts bitching at me again on the way home.. Then he had the nerve to ask what was wrong with my driving.. it's kinda hard to concentrate when someone is yelling at you while your trying to drive. While on the way home, he said that he wouldn't teach me how to drive anymore and when we got in the dirt road drive way, he said that he wasn't yelling at me (he was, i have NO reason to lie about anything like that), he was though.. I have to back up into where I park, which is by "his" goober-mobile and he started yelling at me about that and while I was parking, he goes and messes with the gears and things like that and I asked him what he was doing, he yelled at me not to worry about it, but your not really supposed to go messing with things like that when someone's trying to drive are you?   Well, when I stop to put my truck in reverse, he gets out and slams the doors and waits for me to park, and then he says it's not good enough, but any other time, he's never really had a problem with it.    Finally make it into the house and he starts yelling at me about all sorts of crazy sh!t.    I came out of my room, after bawling my eyes out for a while and he starts fussing at me about how he wasn't yelling and how I am the one who has an attitude. I tried talking to him about it (i should know better than to ever talk to him but i tried...) and as usual, he starts saying that i'm wrong and i'm the one with the attitude. Then he brings up my boyfriend- who has NOTHING to do with what's going on.. Really, my boyfriend is the only guy who actually cares about me (well, my brother does too tho) And then the goes and says how my little brother (who's 11) is more responsible than I am.. and he made some sarcastic comment about how I'm 18 and still have a learners license (which its really his fault I have a learners)   Then he goes and says how he loves my little bother only, but he must have loved before since I'm here..    I swear, I've gotten to the point to where I can't take my stomach hurting awfully bad and crying so much and having to explain to people at school why my eyes are all blood shot and why i sometimes have bruises on me.. I'm pretty much tired of living in fear of my dad's temper and what he could do to me...    Help me.. or help with other ways to deal with this until I move out... Please?
20090226131319AATCO5T	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is this girl interfering and telling me lies, what should I do?	Ok so I like this guy named Seth & I told him that but we go to different schools & we talk over myspace & AIM & I think hes growing to liking me but who knows. Well last night he was on AIM so I started talking to him & I was like hey & then this chick starts messaging me &he told me to stay away from her man that she has read everything Ive ever told him & it turns out that I was talking to her on her account and Seth's account. But the thing im most confused about is she said Seth was her boyfriend when the truth is she dates a guy named Justin, why was she treating me horrible? I mean she has a boyfriend & Seth is just my friend, all I did was tell him I liked him, I was being honest, and he didnt seem to mind that he actually opened up to me more after i told him that & I want to ask Seth about what happened but I dont want it to be her  because she read all the myspace messages & went on his account & for once I thought I was getting somewhere with the guy I like but now Im confused. Why would she read our conversations and lie to me? Or tell me that Im not allowed to talk to the guy I like; my friend? Is she jealous or what? Im confused and Im not sure if I should just risk talking to seth and hope its not her, what is the best way to handle this?

20090226142541AAM5zRN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will three weeks possibly allow my husband to reflect, value, and appreciate our marriage more (plz read on)?	I had an argument with my husband and I think in regards to our marriage he is not adjusting well consciously due to his thinking and the words/actions he does mainly being solo.       He hates it when i say bold marks which by his words often lead me to make those remarks..but i am starting to fear that he is going to start resenting our marriage. I did say this to him and he replied - "i do not like when you think that way, you have ill feeling..its not nice the negative thoughts you have; i do not think that way about you..you have misunderstood some things".      But am i wrong to be angry and think that way. If everytime we talk especially having got married recently. All he refers to is "I or me" but never refers to things as in "us or we" in regards to: vacations etc.       I do not know if i am over-acting or too sensitive, but always when i think about future things and things to do. I always think about us (as in my husband and I), but when it comes to him he is so self-centered it is becoming apparent.      Through his depression and hardship his output from his mind's thoughts has left me with negative thoughts because i feel he shuts me out completely. I know he is trying to strengthen, build his self-esteem and try to stablise himself. But having proposed and wanted for us to get married, and thinking "I" is like sending a bullet to my heart.      I am just so upset, talking on the phone..i just wanted to cry. I do not know what i have done wrong to him. Maybe I am too much in his presence that he does not realise my importances and has forgotten the significances of our relationship.       But I just feel that I should give him his "I" time by going into hiding for three weeks to help him adjust, think and really look deeper into his actions because it is unfair.      QUESTION:   So do you think/ agree that three weeks possibly will allow my husband to reflect, value, and appreciate our marriage more?

My evil step-mom that *****. And the day after she left he hooked up with some blonde chick... wtf and now I'm back in high school in California. My dad got a job in Colorado even though he lives in Kansas, and he left my sister in charge (Who is 15) to take care of my 12 year old brother and my 7 year old sister. It isn't right, isn't she too young to take care of everything and go to high school. I"m 17 by the way. I worry you know. he can't just leave them there and make monthly check-ups! What should I do?
20090226131950AAoUFsL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it weird to be asked if someone can borrow your wedding dress a month after you were married?	I just got married a less then a month ago, got back from my honeymoon about three weeks ago and my husband's aunt askes me if her sons girlfriend could wear my dress to her own wedding in a year. My dress hasn't even been cleaned yet and is still hanging up in my mother's closet from when she picked it up from the hotel the morning we left for our honeymoon and I have yet to go and even pick it up.      This girl has been living with her "husband" for about 12 years now and they have a child "together" who magically turned out black instead of white like his father and mother and the whole family pretends that he's white and acts like there is nothing wrong in this situation (Think of Me, Myself and Irene and you'll get the picture) but I haven't said a damn thing about it and it really wasn't and isn't my place to do so.      We are not friends. We don't talk and to be quite honest I don't like her very much because she obviously cheated on her boyfriend and continuous to try and play it off telling the poor boy he's italian (he gets teased ALL the time).      So when I was asked about whether or not she could use my dress (borrow it and alter it since she is about 4 sizes larger then me and shorter as well) I said NO, because it was weird to me. I just BARELY took that dress off and I was JUST married.      So I got a call getting told I was incredibly rude for being pissed off and saying no--- and that I was being RUDE. Is it weird to be asked such a thing of someone who is neither a friend, or someone I even like, to BORROW (And ultimately alter) MY wedding dress so they can use it at their own wedding-- the dress I spent my wedding night in and everything.      Or perhaps I am just crazy. If it were 5 years from now I probably wouldn't be so insulted (I AM flattered she thinks my dress is beautiful but I think it's disgustingly weird to be asked to wear it) but because it's only been a MONTH from my OWN wedding date, I'm pretty upset that I'm getting such heat over this...

I'm 26 years old and my husband is 25 we have a son who was not a plan kid.We found out i had a bun in the oven just before he he sign up to go overseas he is a Marine.Anyways I told him about two years ago I wanted to have another kid he said I was crazy and joked it off. It hurt my feelings and a week ago I asked what he thought in 3 years when we plan to renew our vows about having a baby and all he said is that our son will be 8 years old and nothing more. So what I get from him without him saying it is that he doesn't want to have anymore kids.So how do I get rid of wanting to have another? And no I wouldn't try to do it anyways I'm not like that.

20090429063002AATbFSM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In a relationship and so confused. Any advice?	I have been dating this guy for about 3 months. He is Lebanese and I am Caucasian. Anyway, things started getting more serious and he told me the other day that he is committed to me but he doesn't know where this is going to go because he doesn't know if his family will approve my situation. I have a daughter from a previous relationship and was never married. He said it is going to be a rough road to go down and he doesn't know if he is strong enough. He also says in the same sentence that he wants to be with me more then anything else so I don't understand. We are both 28 so it's not like we are young and we get along great. What should I do? I am so confused. He knew about my situation before he even asked me out on a date.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Last year I was with my boyfriend of 6 months, and we were just fooling around in my bedroom, nothing explicit. But one thing led to another and we started having sex, and I had never had sex before. About 3 minutes in I freaked and asked him to stop. But he said no... and that he wanted to "finish". and I tried to get him off of me but I couldn't. It's been handled legally and because there was only evidence that we had sex and only my word against his. But I don't know how to get over this emotionally. And it's made me so scared to have sex. It's something I feel should be special, but now it only scares me. What do I do?

20090429061102AAfKyDZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	After all this drama with my ex, I still think he has feelings for me, what do I do?	I would like help dealing with an ex boyfriend situation. 10 points for the best answer, since it's so long.      We were each others first loves, it took him two months to talk to me, he would just stare into my eyes. Once we finally did, we were obsessed.He even told his mom that he loved me more than he loved her. Anyways, he proposed the idea for us to take a break, and I went along with it, figuring it would be good, because we just needed space. The next day, he tried to kiss me, but I resisted. He got mad and started telling people that I had cheated on him and he kept trying to get me jealous. (we go to school together). I ignored it. I tried to contact him to give him his things back, but he never answered so I brought his things in a bag to school and set them in front of him and walked away. He left the bag there. My guy friends, who are really protective over me, knew how he was treating me and didn't like it, so word got around that they were going to fight him. He heard and approached them, and I just happened to walk by when they were about to start fighting. A crowd had already gathered, but before they could start fighting I jumped in and starting punching him before the cops pulled me off. He was stunned, shaking and speechless. It was the talk of the school for a bit, but eventually people forgot about it. He began doing drugs and skipping class, which he never did before. He also started making everyone refer to him by his last name, and now doesn't answer to his first name. Other people noticed the changes in him, and his art teacher suggested I should try and talk to him. I drove to his house and we layed in the grass together, talking. He told me that he didn't care about me anymore and that I didn't need to worry about him. He was holding back tears though. After a couple of hours, we hugged, I left, and I figured it was all over. Two days later, he got a new girlfriend, and I let him be. The summer came, and he went back to his hometown for two months. During that time I realized he was getting people to check up on me for him on myspace, once I realized what was happening I put a stop to it. I also got a new boyfriend, but broke up with him for other reasons.   During the first couple months of school he would pass by my classes, staring at me through the door.I always just turned away. I figured he was playing games.   Then I was introduced to a girl who liked him and wanted me to tell her what he was like. I told her the truth, and she was dumbfounded. She told me that everything he says about him and his new girlfriends relationship sounded exactly like what I told her about ours. She thought I should try and talk to him. And of course, I did. I called him one day after 5 months of not talking, and he hung up on me immediately. I texted him saying that I was offended and didnt understand why he would hang up when we were supposed to be cool with each other. He called back and apologized. He said he was just so shocked to hear my voice he didn't know what to say. He then told me that he was sorry for everything he did to me, and I said I was sorry too and that I never meant to hurt him. But he told me to not get in between him and his girlfriend, so i told him i wouldn't. I asked him about all the myspace stalking, and he denied it. The next day, he tried to move closer to me when we were around each other. Then my friend told me that he walked right up to me and just stared at me, but i was looking the other direction so he walked away looking hurt.I just let it go. Another couple of months went by, and I heard he was talking about some personal stuff about us, to a group of people. I was mad so I called him. I thought he was going to be hostile towards me but instead he spoke softly and said he was sorry if he woke me up and that he would let me sleep if I wanted. I continue to call him by his first name, and he said it was ok but I'm the only person who can call him that. But he still swears he doesn't care about me anymore. He is still going out with that girl, but she goes to a different school. He also still does drugs and skips at least 2 days out of the week. Then a few days ago I was at work and got a call that one of my guy friends who was involved in the fight between us, his little sister who is 14 had snuck out after a fight with her mom and he picked her up to take her to spend the night. I got my friend and his mom and we went to his house and got her, there was lots of drama. He swore that he was just trying to provide a safe place for her to stay.   Then last night we ended up hanging out at his house(first time in 3 months that we were alone together), I told him I didn't want to go home so he cancelled his plans and stayed with me. We just talked and listened to music. We then got drunk and didn't do anything sexual but we fell asleep holding each other.   What do you think is going on? Does he still have feelings?   How do I get him to admit it?

I don't see him too much because he lives with my grandparents ( ina a different town) after his last "vacation" for well....let's just say severely hurting my mother (they are now divorced) and that's putting it nicely.

Like most kids his age, he asks alot of questions and likes to make comments about stuff all the time about anything and everything LOL, which is ok cuz I'm sure I was the same way when  I was young.  When I'm not work(and for the most part in public) I usually barefoot, usually in like athletic shorts and a t-shirt.its warm most of the year here.       One day I picked him up from School, drove there barefoot and he started asking me questions about it, he seemed kinda facisnated by it. "Uncle Chad how come you always got barefeet"  " u most not like socks and shoes" I kinda laughed not sure what to say so I clapped feet together and told him Iiked being barefoot. He started talking about something else(2 sec attention span kids have LOL)      Later, when we were eating he was like "Uncle Chads got no shoes or socks on" I tapped my feet on the floor and was like Yup. Then I was throwing a Nerf foam football with him after and he seemd impressed I could kick it with no shoes on, I joked with him that of course I could.      Now My sister tells me she had argue with him the other day to put his shoes and socks on, She jokingly said I put him up to it or egged him on a little.  I dont see it as a big deal though, prolly some phase he will forget in a few weeks.

A girl on a DATE who shows cleavage and shows skin up to her Pelvis is screaming take me for Casual, im your Playground and have fun with me. But infact that's not the girl's intentions at all; she infact wanted a SINCERE RELATIONSHIP. When you talk to her 6 months later or a year later crying with Mascara running down her face. Confused as to why her Boyfriend left her ?? It goes back to again the 1st Impressions of the Man on those first 4 or 5 dates. The way she dressed and the implicit message she sent to that Man. She marketed her **** , her legs or her azz and she got herself a Buyer. Very Natural. She got herself a Man who will take her for casual despite all the sweet lovely things she says to her Man it goes back to ACTIONS . Dignity, Honor, Self-Respect. And for *MEN* a large part of that goes to the way she dresses and how she carries herself. I'm not saying Don't have Sex with your Date. But don't put out on the 4th or 5th date. Give it 2 weeks IF YOU WANT A RELATIONSHIP !!!!       WHY DO YOU GIRLS SHOW SO MUCH SKIN AND PUT OUT WITHIN A WEEK WHEN YOU WANT A REAL SINCERE RELATIONSHIP ???? DO YOU GIRLS JUST LOVE TO SET YOURSELF UP FOR A HEARTBREAK 9 MONTHS DOWN THE LINE ??????????

20090226105530AA6KmVu	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I ignore my alcoholic mother, or help her?	My mum has been an alcoholic even before I was born and for years I have been on/off with depression.  She promised she would stop, or not drink some nights and just let me down.  So i've basically prevented myself from getting hurt anymore.  But just recently, she is claiming she wants to give up, however I don't want to listen to it anymore because I will just be setting myself up for a fall.  She's even proven she doesn't mean it because she hasn't showed up to any of the AA meetings she'd looked in to.      I don't know what to do.  Things are getting worse. I'm being verbally and sometimes physically abused by her.  We now live again with my dad, although they are divorced, but they are not a couple and he just ignores it and pretends there are no problems to speak of.      I want my mum to get better, but I have no one to turn to.   Please, I'm begging for advice, please =[.   Thank you.

The thing is me and this girl were REALLY close, texting each other every day etc she said that she had feelings for me.

I have been with my bf for 5 1/2 years and have been living together for 5 years. We have a 10month old baby boy together as well. I have brought up the subject of getting married, and the 1st time he said he wasn't ready and didn't want to talk about it. I waited till about 4 months ago and asked him about it again and he told me to quit pressuring him into it. so i gave him a choice that either he gets me a ring in 6 months or i am gone. He has 1 month left and i really don't think he will ask me. He talks about getting a house together but i told him i wasn't buying a house till we were married. I don't know what to do? I don't want to wait around forever but i also don't want to split up our little family. I am really confused? Please help. Any advice would be great.

You have a child with someone, you get divorced, the courts order you to pay child support.....why don't you pay? Is it because you don't have the money? You are mad at the ex?

20090226131553AANkBs5	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when..?	Pretty much, I've been through tons of **** in the past and I've made several mistakes that I'm not even going to go into. For the past year now I"ve been trying to fix things and make things right. I thought I was doing pretty good until something made me realize today. I don't do one big thing...I don't appreciate my friends the way I should....I love my family, I love my boyfriend I appreciate them! but not my friends. This is what I hate myself for. I think the reason is because my whole life all of my friends have been nothing but backstabbers, maybe it's because I'm just selfish, I don't know why but I do know for a fact that I LOVE everybody in my life and would never ask for anyone else. So how can I show my friends that I do care about them my boyfriend's sister especially. I feel terrible because my friends have never given me reason not to trust them and all I can do is sit here and complain about them being around me too much, or she is annoying me because so and so or whatever. Why can't I just open my blind *** eyes and see what I have right here infront of me, God I feel like s uch a *****! How do I change this? I want to change this now!

20090226135652AAw6IlO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My bf broke up with me because of my jealousy.....Pls answer?	So me and my bf have been together for 4 years and have a 15 month old daughter and about 4 months ago in the middle of the night while we were going to bed his phone rang and it was a friend (a guy) that had come into town unexpectedly and he wanted to go out --- I was like ok but while he was out I called him just to see how things were going and he didn't call back after me calling SEVERAL times and it bothered me so that night I went thru his phone (I had never done this before) and saw that other people that called him that night he answered the phone but not me????  So I went further and read some text messages between him and his "co-worker" (a female) that seemd a little a too flirty for me so long story short ever since then I have pretty much been a snoop (going thru phone, pockets, papers, etc) all this he knows and it seemed like gradually over time he stopped wanting to spend time with me and it seems like he doesn't want to be around me so anyway last night we had a talk about why he doesn't want to spend any time with me and he pretty much said he doesn't want to be hounded for stuff I THINK he's doing.....he's pretty much tired of me questioning him about this and that ALL the time and I flat out asked him do you want to still be in a relationship and he kept saying I don't know....and I kept pestering him to please give me an answer and he said let's try being friends for awhile ---- this really broke my heart to hear....do you think he will take me back after I let the jealousy get the best of me?  I really don't want him to go but I feel sooooooooo lonely all the time cause it's not the same as before he syas he's not doing anything but with him spending less time with me I can't help but wonder if he's with someone else?  Should I let it be? What should I do?

20090226135322AAWV8aW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people ignore you when it would be better to talk?	I had a little office romance going.  Then I thought the guy was breaking it off with me, and I just sorta ran off.  I didn't call or email the entire night and instead just went shopping.  I felt like an idiot because I just really liked his friendship mainly, and we liked a lot of the same things etc.  It was basically like he told me he needed to figure things out only he put it to me like I was the one that needed to figure things out.  So yeah, I was ticked and I knew he was going out with a guy friend that night and ... I just figured he wanted to meet someone else with less strings attached.      Next morning I was doing fine until he sent me an email at work.  Then I was inclined to check my personal email and found he had written me one and I was still so mad.  I sent him a really nasty email where I told him his "issues had issues" and he took great offense.  Go figure.  I'm the one ticked off and when someone tries to apologize, I make it worse lol.      So now I'm being ignored completely, and it sucks.  It really sucks because he was cooler than my girlfriends, and this gay guy that used to work here that i was friends with.  I know I can make new friends...
20090226132857AAAZCxa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband being unreasonable or am I over reacting.?	Heres the thing.

Now he's saying they're going to the midnight viewing on Thursday and I cant go because I have to get up at 5 to go to work.  I told him this but he didnt offer to change they're plans and not only did he say he was going to the midnight viewing he's also stopping at his friends house.      Im not sure if Im over reacting but I feel totally neglected as we never do anything together.  The last time he went out drinking he went with the same friend.  I just feel like Im invisible.
20090226132924AASvqX0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do I need more friends?	I am in high school.  I used to have a group of like 10 friends, but we grew apart and now I only have 1 really close friend.  I just don't have much time to have friends and don't want to make friends just for the heck of it.  But I am a really busy girl with many extra-curricular activities in my life and when I do these activities, I am always meeting new people, although I don't actually maintain long-term friendships with them.  I don't really like my high school in particular so I am just treating high school as a kind of time that I have to pass to get to college, where my real life will be and I'll actually have time to make lots of friends.        I am really happy not having any friends but my 1 close friend, but something inside of me is like, "Why don't you have lots of friends at school?"  I feel fine though, is it bad for me or something to only have 1 close friend at school?

20090226134915AA7Lkie	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Give me your honest answer and why please?	Me and my spouse have been married for 7 months now, and have 2 kids and 1 on the way. Neither one of us work right now and I'm a full time student in college. Now here's the problem, my spouse have a bad attitude problem and in my opinion counseling is needed. My spouse believe that I don't do enough for her and always gone, since I got school and hate that I play a card game called yugioh. My spouse and brother's wife got into a big arguement where now they are not talking and now can't stand the brother. The brother and I play yugioh for hours at a time to keep us from doing or starting any bad habits, like cheating. My problem I have with my spouse is that she don't care whether I'm happy as long as she get her way, and I say that because. When we're around each other either my spouse have everyone watching reality t.v. shows, on myspace, or talking about people she know and I'm not for all of all that (well some of the shows are good). Now I spend so much time wit her I fell 3 classes that I'm currently retaking, stop going to the gym because my spouse start complaining even though I got everyone in the house membership, and don't go no where because my spouse accuse of cheating unless I'm playing yugioh at the brother's house. Now recently, my spouse got so mad at me playing yugioh while she was gone wit her wit her grandma that she throw some of my clothes outside, called me all type of ugly names and I said some to, and my spouse locked me out our house and imbarrass me. Now here's the question? If all those things happen to you on a regular and spouse feel that you deserved it would you get a divorce? I need serious answers, prefer couples with good marriages

I reach into my bag,grab a pen, and she snatches it out of my hand and fills in all but one spot on the signup for the shift i was looking at with her family's names and she's like "Oh sorry i took your pen i just had to sign up for this shift. See ya!" So i decided i wasnt going to let her intimidate me and signed in that last spot. Now i am having second thoughts. Should i stick with pretending not to be intimidated or just chicken out?

Long story short-at lunch i said "97% of people in that section are ignorant."   Amy said, "I'm part of the good 3% right?"   "Yeah. Sometimes you have ignorant questions like that video about hell. But besides that you're okay.'      She didn't seem upset about it at all but I just read (like 5 minutes ago) 2 questions that she wrote about me on here!      My question is: Wasn't Amy wrong to write a question to people she doesn't even know instead of talking to me about it? I JUST found out and I feel so bad. I really didn't mean to offend her with my comment, plus Amy and I usually joke like that a lot.   What do I do? Am I overreacting?
20090226134935AA8VDsZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Blended Family Issues...Sharing?	Okay as some of you know I am a married woman with a girl 11 and a boy 13 from a previous marriage and my husband has 2 boys 13 and 14 from a previous relationship well anyways my husband and I don't have much money so we have to stretch it, but my husbands ex has a lot of money (she has custody of my step sons) and she constantly showers them with gifts for bdays and Christmas, she usually gives about 10-20 presents for Christmas and B Days, and my kids are very jealous of that because my step boys get all types of electronics and clothes and shoes for birthdays but mine don't and my step sons don't usually brag about it and don't usually bring anything from their house accept for clothes their cell phones and their PSP, well let's get to the point this past Christmas my kids only got a cheap Ipod and clothes but my Step sons got laptops amongst other things but the thing is my youngest step son doesn't bring his to our house (we get them on weekends) but my oldest does and my oldest step son makes video games (he got a custom made gaming laptop) and don't get me wrong he is good and he wants to be a game developer, so he has a lot of software on his laptop for making games, but at least when my son asks to use it he let's him but the other day my son put the I pod  software on my step sons laptop without asking, so when my step son got ready to use his laptop he realized that his computer was running a tad bit slower and then he saw the I pod software he got raving mad and told my son never to touch his laptop again, so my son came to get me and told me about it, so I went into my step sons room said that he was being mean and that he still had to share it when he brings it here, but my step son said that he was not being mean and that he was sharing with him because he had no problem with him but he said that my son violated his trust by downloading something without asking and said it didn't belong to my son or me so he really didn't have to share it anymore, so I told my husband and my husband said that my son should have asked and that he did violate the trust by downloading stuff without asking knowing it would mess with the game software, and I said that it was not fair that my son is denied a laptop by my step son when he was sharing all along, my step son said that his mother bought it and it was his mother's money and legally I couldn't make him do anything with it unless she gave permission so I called my husbands ex and told her and she said that my son was wrong and that the laptop wasn't for him and that she taught her son to take care of his things and she also said she told him that if someone didn't respect her sons things then they are not allowed to touch it, what can I do cause at Christmas time my kids get jealous of my step kids because they have so much and because they have a mother and a father (my kids father has never been around) that loves them very much, well anyways my husband and I don't don have much around christmas time ($300) dollars so my kids still won't get much, and my oldest step son is not being fair, what can I do?

20090226134832AALKDjA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is the best way to get over feeling intense anger towards someone?	I have been with my husband for 10 years, and my mother in law has been very hurtful to me for most of them. She manipulates situations to get her way, makes up lies about me, will put me down to my face, and for years I never defended myself nor did my husband defend me.   It caused alot of arguements with my husband, because he felt he did defend me and said he knows how to handle his mom better than I do, and I always felt as if he never defended me the way I needed to be. I wound up making a comment to my mil at a family event putting her in her place which backfired adn caused a whole big drama. To which my husband didn't stand by my side and in my view really just stayed neutral. This again, caused a big problem in my marriage because I always tell him what she does that bothers me and explain to him that i need him to back me up. Since then we have gone to marriage counseling and he has been backing me up, we learned from our marriage therapist, that when it comes to dealing with her, we always need to have a plan in place on how we are going to remain a team and support eachother, and things have extremely improved for us as a couple. But, I have extremely, extremely, intense feelings of anger and hatred towards my mil, that it's almost become an obsession. Sometimes at night, i can't sleep because i am just thinking about how much i hate her and the unfair, manipulating things she has done. When driving to work, I replay what i want to say to her and wind up yelling and screaming in the car (people driving past me must think i'm crazy). I have really lost control over my anger and can't seem to stop thinking about this woman. Easter is coming up (we have an agreement to only see them on holidays), and my husband said if i don't want to be around her than we could just spend easter with my family, but we have 2 kids, his sister has kids, and i don't know if this is the best way. I feel i need to speak with someone about this anger, but when I did, the therapist just focused on my mil stories, and diagnosed my mil with having borderline personality disorder and for being narcissistic....which is probably true, but it doesn't help me to control my thoughts. Anyone out there ever hate someone soooooooo much that it became an obsession and if they did, how did you get over it???
20090226135234AAWDtZ1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ended my LD relationship via text message, is that wrong?  i caught him cheating many times, keep that in mind?	I was in a long distance relationship and i ended it with a text message because about a month ago he cheated on me and this isn't the first time i caught him.  I let him back before and this time I had enough, so i ended the relationship via text message.  When I caught him about a month ago, i was nice and told him this wouldn't work and that he hurt me too many times, he kept calling and i answered and talked it out with him, but he started acting up again last week so i just ended it with a text and now he's calling, emailing me and i refuse to answer any of his messages, he says it's immature that i ended it through text message.  Was that wrong?  Should i email him back and explain?  do i even bother with that?  i mean he cheated many times and continued last month, does he deserve more of my time?

20090226135258AAr5XTM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give him another chance?	I've known this guy for 11 years. For the past 3 1/2 years he's been living with his current girlfriend. Every year around the same time, he calls me up telling me he wants to be with me...until his girlgriend finds out. Then he acts like I contacted him, and tells me to leave them alone. This year he did it again, saying he just doesn't want to hurt anybody else like he's done me, and he's just looking for the right time to leave. He's just asking for a little time. He's very protective of his privacy and won't let me see his phone, read texts, etc. He restricts his number when he calls even though I already have it. After I grabbed his phone, I saw texts to and from her, and he tells both of us the same thing, especially when it comes to our insecurities. I don't feel I'm anything special. He once told my uncle I wasn't his type, then tried to say he meant height wise. But I know he likes girls of a different complexion with big booties.       We see each other, have sex, and a few days later he asks for a PlayStation3 to be sent to a different residence. I probably won't do it because I still think that leaves him opening to protect what he has with her, and diss me again leaving me out of $500.      I told him he only has so long, to which he responded that's not fair. I asked why wasn't she getting him the PlayStation, and he said he didn't want to be cool with her like that.      Do I believe him when he says he will leave, or am I being played....again? Do I get him the PlayStation and demand that it be sent to his home or his mother's or just plain forget everything and stay away from him because he means me no good?

20090226134626AAZ3ijX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help, I have a wedding dilemma. Should parents be expected to pay (I think not ....)?	My partner of nearly 20 yrs proposed on NY day and we are starting to make the arrangements for Dec this year. We have discussed raising the money through our bank which shouldn't be a problem and the re-payment won't affect us too much on a monthly basis.  My parents have not discussed making any contributions and I don't expect them too but my In laws to be have said they want to loan us some money rather than borrowing from the bank. This is very generous of them but they are also making  comments to my partner about whether my parents are going to contribute.( I guess they feel if they are making an offer then my parents should aswell)  I now feel very uneasy about the whole thing and would much rather we stood on our own 2 feet at our age without having to rely on parents and all the bad feeling this could potentially generate between his parents and mine. To make it worse, I am sure that our finances and wedding plans are being discussed amongst his family and my family are being made to look "mean". This whole wedding planning has now been spoilt for me as  I can see it turning into a fight between our two families.  Help please before I call the whole thing off.

20090226145320AAYJlvq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i dump him or no? (guys input would be GREATLY appreciated)?	ok so, i'm the kinda girl who love, love, LOVES to talk. i'm a really friendly person and i'm very sporty and outgoing.      ok so here's the story...   so i'm going out with this guy Brian. he's sporty, funny, really sweet, and super smart. we have a lot in common and we've been friends since the beginning of 8th grade (i'm in 8th grade now) we've been going out for almost 3 weeks now. we haven't really done anything, but hold hands, occasionally. we have 1 class together and we sit by each other.      the problem   this guy Sean likes me. he's super funny, really sweet, pretty smart, and again, sporty. i've known sean since the beginning of 7th grade, so last year. we were pretty good friends but this year we've really clicked as friends.      Sean loves to talk, like me. he's really friendly and he's outgoing, just like me. Brian, is quiet and kinda...held back if you know what i mean. he doesn't like to be very social.      the worst part...they're good friends.      i'm starting to like sean, and my friend jon says i should go out with him. i want to but i don't want to break up with brian. but brian is WAY too quiet for me, and i think sean is a better match.      so my questions   1.) should i stay with brian or should i try it with sean?   2.) if i do break up with brian, would it be absolutely horrible to go out with his friend?

20090226142157AAEYaEQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP! Does she like me? PLEASE answer this? Please? What is she doing?	We live in new york, we're in high school. She asked me for a hug before, very shyly. She grabbed my hand before to bring me back to her because I was walking away. This was a while ago. She always used to come up and just ask me something random, to start a conversation, but i never went up to her. She would sometimes playfully hit me on the side. there are so many other things she has done before like that.       Today we talked for the first time in a while, she stopped coming there for a bit. I showed her how to play something on the keyboard then she showed me something she learned. she hit me on the side playfully once or twice. then we went to leave the class and she was way ahead then came back and was like, "omg, i look terrible" (her not me) while looking in the mirror as i walked by. i'm a junior, she's a soph. does she just think i'm cute or what? i don't like her though, that was last month.

I dont deserve this right?	omg omg omg!!!!! someone i need advise really fast! ok, i go to a dance school in nevada and it can use corporal punishment if ur parents sign a permission form, and mine did! omg, ok so there are a lot of "clicks" in dance and like we do crazy stuff like pants other girls, give each other wedgies, etc. and ok, theres this shy loser girl in dance who just annoys me so i pantsed her (we can wear shorts to dance not just leotards) and by accident i pulled down her panties too!! omg she started to cry and then the teacher saw and of course the snitch told on me!!!!!!!!! omg, im so scared, the teacher (who's a woman luckily) sent me into the changing room and told me that i have to sit out for the day in the changing room and then she's going to "teach me a lesson" as she said!!!!! OMG, this is a private dance school so theres no such thing as being suspended and so you can only be expelled so i was begging her to not tell my mom or expell me, so the teacher told me that i had two choices: either i would get expelled (and mom finds out) or i would have to get "taught a lesson" but my teacher wouldnt tell my mom about this. so that i could participate in dance next time and not be in trouble! i chose to get the lesson taught because if i got expelled my mom would be paying for nothing and then id get grounded for like months and probably taught a lesson by her too! omg, what's going to happen to me? do i deserve this? will she make me take the lesson in my panties so i learn it better, or whatever? will the loser girl be there?? omg help!! dance ends in a bit over an hour and fifteen minutes, and right now im on a friends laptop in the changing room. she she lives right next to the studio and showed the class this dance video that she made with her old dance school. anyway, please help, omg!!!!!!!!!!1

Okay I'm writing an e-mail to this kid (i like him but he hasn't talked to me since I moved back and i'm too shy to talk to him in person, i'm 14 so...) Okay his name's alec and I like him and he likes me, we both know this and we used to be friends, in a nutshell, I left, cameback, left, cameback, and now I'm trying to be his friend again :D      Okay which "e-mail" roughdraft sounds better?   1)  Alec,           Hey it's ________. I was just wondering how school's goin' for ya? It's okay for me, except one thing... WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?! I've wanted to talk to you but you know me well enough to know that I wait for YOU and you can't wait for ME. I really wanna be friends but it won't work if you don't talk to me. So maybe we can start at least with a "hey" in the hall. I know how social you are and YOU have to be the one to start the conversation or else there will never be one. Anyways, hope you get this and please respond :D      or       2) Hey Alec,               It's_________ I was just wondering if you noticed I was back? I mean I can see if you didn't... okay no i can't but still :D you know me, I'm shy and even if I know someone, It takes them coming to me to start a conversation, not me going to them (unless it's my bff) I really wanna be your friend, maybe we  can at least start by saying "hey" in the hall to each-other, you have to say it to me though :D I hate talking to people if I don't know if they wanna talk to me. You gotta lemme know that you want to talk to me. Seeya on Monday. Please respond.      Okay which sounds better? if neither can you please suggest what to say? I mean I'm sure you get the gist of who I am. :D thanks in advance :D I don't wanna FORCE him to talk to me, that's why I'll    e-mail him, then he has a choice of whether to respond or not. thanks again :D

20090226141556AAFPnWx	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do about my cheapskate, irresponsible, sad excuse of a father? (long story but I relaly need help)?	Now before you jump at the chance to say I'm being disrespectful HEAR ME OUT.      I'm 15 going on 16 in about a month and my dad has never been much of a father to me. He and my mom were never married and from the time I was a baby to about 11 or 12 years old I saw him once or twice a week at my grandmothers house because he has a serious drinking problem. I have, however, been over his house once or twice and when I did he got seriously drunk, so when I was 11, I asked him to take me to his house (my mom didn't know about this, she's the one who told him to take me to my grandma's whenever he saw me) and he got drunk out of his mind and that's a story in itself. Well, after that incident, I decided to stop seeing him and he pretty much just went with it. Now on the other hand, my half-sister has gotten MUCH more from him than I ever did. He paid for her braces, he paid for a good portion of her college tuition, and I'm pretty sure he bought her a laptop. I know this because we keep in touch...she can't stand him either however. He's complained about paying for those things because her mother has gotten into several fights with him about money but he still payed for it, probably because she demanded it. Around Christmas he called me and said "hey rach just wanted to see how you were and if you wanted anything for christmas, I know I haven't been the best dad and I'm sorry for that etc etc." It wasn't the first time he'd done something like this and in the past he always said he would change...yet he didn't even make an effort. I knew this BUT I felt sorry for him because no one really wants to be around him and he was all alone on Christmas. Well I saw him for the first time in years and obviously I was right, he didn't change, he complained even about the bill at olive garden instead of just being happy that his daughter was giving him a second chance. He also gave my sister a $200 ipod touch for Christmas and he gave me $100, now I wasn't looking for something to pick at but that's playing favoritisms in my book. My sister refuses to talk to him too, so it seems to me like he's being slightly more generous to the wrong people. About 2 years ago my aunt moved out and since t

She was always talking sh*t and acting like she never said anything like she's so perfect. Well about 6 of my friends spoke to her yesterday and she was saying I am a "crack head c**t", a "fat wh*re" and "I had drinking problems and drank my self crazy when my fat loser ex dumped me". When they spoke to her again she denied ever talkin. Haley, Natalie, Hayley, and Aliyah are not talking to her anymore especially after that.  Justina and Elizabeth still talk to her even though she always talks about them. And about everyone! And no I'm not exagerating. Should I tell her off tommorrow? I'm sure everyone always wanted to but are too scared of her making stuff up and getting them in trouble.

My brother was literally allowed to beat me, and he is only 11.   Well now he has started totally disrespecting me, calling me a sl** and telling me all i do is sit at my house on my a**.  I do not work, because of the pregnancy, and i think i should have some time off for myself and the baby, but that’s none of my brother business as long as my husband makes enough, and he does.    Also calling my and my mother names such as a b**** and a cu**.    I do not work, because of the pregnancy, and i think i should have some time off for myself and the baby.   My parents just let him say all of these nasty things,    he even swears at them, and they allow him to watch these disturbing youtube videos about swearing, sex and drugs.    I don’t think this is right at all, and im afraid what my little brother is going to turn into, epically with my parents allowing this behavior.    This has all been going on since he was 7 years old. Im at a loss of how to tell my parents nicely that this just isn't normal behavior, and if he is going to continue to act like this i don't want him around my own child.       I have tried to talk to my mother about this and she said kids will be kids, their is nothing i can do about it. Its almost like she is afraid to discipline him.

Hes had all the treatments, chemo etc. But it has spread to his stomach and maybe more places my family try to keep everything from me. Hes always tired and has lost his appetite. What does this mean? How long could he have left? Also he goes to the hospice for massages, could this mean anything?

20090226143019AAvHDxQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is 9 years old too young to be married?	Or is it ok because of the circumstances?  Just looking for opinions...       http://www.associatedcontent.com/article... 
20090226142514AACbJ0j	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Some honest opinions/advice please?	My now husband and I knew each other for 4 years before we got married...its been 5 months since we got married. We lived for a year together before this. In that year I knew that though my bf was a very loving caring person...he just lacked some of my expectations.      I am a cleanliness freak....and I have been told so my my ex roomies, my parents..an especially my bro!      And from my 1 year stay with my bf...I found that he happens to be one of the most clutter creating person I have come across. Now I said to myself that it will change n improve etc. But now its been 6 months after marriage and its worse.      I work full time, cook, clean, pick up after him all the time. Its just too much. He is honest, hard working kind but does nothing to help me around. All he knows is gym, tv and work. If he wants dinenr he will just say he is hungry and I cook n serve n pick up dishes and clean everything before we go to bed every night. I do laundry, fold, iron the clothes, I vaccum, shop for grocery, clean bathrooms. He once told me he does not liek to see dirty dishes in the basin. So everytime I use any I rinse n put them in the dish washer. But when he keeps those in there its ok. If i tell him he gets mad.      This all seems so much childish bickering.      Yesterday I told him why does he not do so..n he tells me he never expects me to do things and that I do them anyway and then expect him to do things.      I was like wtf?      I am so angry n depressed n hurt.      I cannot even say I love him because I am so upset...      What should I do?      I feel all the work I do around gets no appreciation. But if i dont do it who will?         People say communicate...our communication is only fighting.      WHAT TO DO?
20090226141115AA50UYF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best friend rejecting me-- being RUDER, what do I do?	 http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    That's what she did before.    First, I'll say that I'm a silly person so what I said today was out of silly, of course I don't believe in gremlins, but she was a b***** about it:         We were at lunch and my friend Dillon got spicy chicken strips. I recently had a dead roach on my tray so I now joke about the food just for silly and don't eat lunch:      Well, I said "Eww, Dillon, you're eating Gremlin turds!" and he laughed and I had got Lasagna just for something to do besides sit there at the table and Dillon (Dillon is a weirdo, lol) said "Look, you got lasagna-- that's elephant s***, and that (he pointed to the lasagna) is the meat of the poo! And that (he pointed to a tomato in the lasagna) is blood in the poo!" and I laughed and said "Gross!" and then Tyra who I wasn't even talking to says ever so sarcastically "You do know that gremlins aren't real right?" and I said back, like in my your-a-b**** tone "Yesss" and Tyra said like I'm ignorant, just like she called me the other day "Oh, good, b/c if you didn't you'd be...insane" and she did that little hand signal by her head.    I just made a face and ignored her. What do I do?    Thanks for the help(:
20090226144245AATcHyf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help with my best friend(sorry this is so long)?	I have been best friends with this girl for about 2 or 3 years.  We are 13 now. She is very smart (all A's in school etc.), but does not act it. She wears too much makeup, wears too-tight clothes, and flirts with every guy under 20 that we meet or pass on the streets. I have never fully realized the extent of her behavior until recently.  For winter break, she went on a cruise and, when she got back, she told me and her other best friend (my best friend too), that she was totally gone and had sex with some guy on her vacation. He was 17.  She ditched him for another guy, age 16, who she did not sleep with but just about. She convinced the second guy to dump his girlfriend to be with her. I was not totally shocked but, then, it dawned on me that this was the same girl who, 2 weeks ago, I had watched a Disney movie with.  She bakes cupcakes for us on our birthdays, but yet she is a complete “sleaze.” Anyone would usually respond to this with, "she probably has super low self-esteem", but she doesn't. She thinks she is the "hottest girl alive."  Both me and our mutual friend have had serious discussions with her, us saying things like "how could you do something like this? How could you not be thinking at all?  How did your conscience not be alarmed since you pretty much did something "illegal?"  Her always saying, "You're right, I don’t regret it, but if  I knew it would upset people I would have had second thoughts, I'm sorry."  It mostly involves sarcasm on  her part. We tell her that she needs to use good morals, and she goes "Uhmm? What are morals, how do I get them?' She made a list of things like be nice to people, don't have sex with people older than you, know them at least a year before you do something this serious and others. She is very smart. She knows all the answers. She knows how to use her head. But she doesn't. I miss my friend. And I don't know how I can be friends with the person that I am friends with but also be friends with the one that is a sleaze. I really don't know what to do. We, her two best friends, are seriously reconsidering a friendship with her, but it really makes me sad because, once upon a time, I trusted her and, now, I just don't.  Is there another way to handle the situation?      she also lost her virginity when she was 12

20090226140534AAJLHjA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Who Is Wrong Husband Or I, On This?	My husband and I, we need to get our budgets ‘cause he is a real estate agent and the market is not good. So we are cutting on going out as often as we used and other things. However, my husband wants to eliminate our son’s college saving, rather than his daughter college saving from previous marriage. My husband’s reasoning is our 8yr goes to private school and his daughter does not and his daughter is 17 and will be going to college next yr. I said NO and since both of the saving accounts are coming off from my salary I stopped his daughters saving and he is mad now. Do you think I’m wrong? BTW the 17yr mother is 6th grade dropout who won’t  help. We started saving for her college since she was 16. Also, we pay child support. As mother my 1st priority is my child.
20090226140554AAkSvol	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my Dad put so much into a huge, empty house full of stress and frustration?	My dad thinks our familys happiness depends on us having a HUGE house in a rich neighborhood. Those things would be nice if he wasnt wokring all the time. We have the huge house, but it isnt making us happy. He works ALL THE TIME! he just sits at his desk 14 hours+ a day.. he wakes up at 4 in the morning and sometimes is working to the early hours of the morning.. no joke. I have this play to go too, its a feild trip for my school, but i now have no ride since my mother is no longer available to drive me. Anyways, today i think he felt bad that i couldnt go, and was asking about it and trying to see if i could get a ride from someone else. I snapped because he wouldnt stop asking me about it and i know i dont have a ride, it was just making it worse. He looked down with extremely sad eyes and said "i'm not much of a father am i." and walked out of the room. It made my heart hurt...       He built this house with his bare hands and the help of one other hired person.. it took him 3 years to do it, idk why he thouhgt he HAD to do it, we are still in so much debt from it. Anyways, now that we might have give our house to the bank because my dads hard work isnt even enough to cover the bank payments for this house, hes falling into a deep depression knowing that these last 5 years of stress and work have gone to nothing and were all in vain. We have no happiness.       Anyways, what should i say too him? Ive already said he was a good father and worked hard for us, but i dont think that covers the amount of stress he is under. What would you do?

As I went through my travels, us two grew close. It was in Lavender cave where he evolved to form an Ivysaur, his name is Daddy. One day my friend was over and while I was jerking one off, he connected our games and stole Daddy! He wont give him back, so I may actually need to kill him to get Daddy back. That Ivysaur was the only father I've ever had (I never met my real dad) and I need him back. I can't sleep, it's like losing a family member. Please help me. What should I do?

20090226141302AA0QJpC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	AGE DIFFERENCE!!!?????	Age difference and going out?   okay well this guy was on my bus last year and he was about 2 years younger than me. he asked me out and i said no. plus at the time i wasnt really big on talking to younger guys or older ones either. so i saw him the other day after school and he plays football and he has gotten really tall. like the year before he was maybe my headlength but he has gotten like 5 inches taller than me. but the problem is is that he was like 2 years younger than me. im 14 and hes 12 or 13 i cant remember how old he was again cause its been so long since we talk. so i wrote him a letter just basically telling him how hard high school was and how was his summer. i have two questions. DO YOU THINK IT WAS WRONG FOR ME TO WRITE THE LETTER AND IS IT WRONG FOR A GIRL TO GO OUT WITH A BOY THAT IS 1 OR 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME?

20090226144112AAwOqVE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I include Response Cards?	I know that I should base all my decisions on the presumption that every prospective guest knows etiquette basics.  Technical etiquette requires guests to timely respond to an invitation by hand, i.e. "Miss Jane Doe accepts with pleasure the kind invitation of Mr. & Mrs. Smith on June 18, 2009 at twelve o'clock noon" or to say as much via telephone.      Therefore, I am hesitant to include Response Cards for fear that people may believe I think them are so innocent of manners as to not respond.      Then again, I appreciate the fact that they are convenient for guests.  But after helping with family members' weddings, it's been my experience that half of the guest list doesn't RSVP anyway, despite the fact that response cards were included.  Presumably because those too rude to answer by hand will also fail to take the trouble to mail the response card.  We ended up having to telephone the missing people and ask whether we would have the pleasure of their company.   So there went all the money spent on the response cards and the stamps.      So, I'm kind of wondering what's the point?

I also have had a child with another man, who i am hoping to marry, after the div0rce. i read an article online that stated:   "a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall have capacity to remarry under Philippine law."      does that mean i can remarry to another filipino citizen afterwards also??i am very confused on the process and need much help understanding what to do. my biggest problem is that i dont have any idea where to begin.if you have any information,any at all, i'd appreciate it. Thank you.

20090226140433AAiAc30	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being unreasonable?	I asked my husband who works away to come home for my daughters parents evening at school tonight. He said it was a womans job and his job is to provide money. We are both drs, he works away in the week (long story-we seperated twice and while seperated last time he got a job as a gp partner in his own practice, now he doesn't want to relocate back home because he is happy in his job but doesn't want us to move out to be with him either-says the financial climate is not right for a move). He is on a 2 day course which should have finished at 4pm, he usually comes home once a week on wed/thurs anyway. He came home last night but said he wasn't prepared to come home two nights in a row even for a parents evening. He hasn't called since, he usually calls several times a day. How do I handle him? I feel like he rips my heart out when he behaves like this.

20090226141314AAoHPtH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	An awkward question.... how do i ask if i'm his gf?	i know its not like elementary school and the person has to ask "will you be my girlfriend?" but i've been dating a guy for a month and a half, we spend a lot of time together, everyone at our work knows we are dating, we go on actual "dates", have made many plans for the near future (but longer than the time we've been already dating)together, and his roommate made a comment about how we're a cute couple. i feel kind of silly for an adult to ask another "so am i your girlfriend?" . and we're both still listed as single on our myspaces and such (yes i know its cheesy) but i feel like maybe he hasnt said anything about it bc i just got out of a serious relationship lasting a few years and doesnt want to scare me off. but i'm not, so how do i sneakily ask him what already seems pretty obvious? lol ok just a thought :-D

20090226142456AAZX3uo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is going on with her?	My girlfriend and I broke up after 4 years together, recently she has been talking alot (and I as well) about marriage, kids, the heavy stuff. We also got into a fight about abortions, 2 days later she broke up with me. She has been hanging out with 2 girls in college that are not good influences, one dates a convicted fellon, and the other just tried to kill herself. They hate me because I dont like them. She told me that her friends made her think and she doesnt love me anymore. Keep in mind we are BEST friends, ands she is a very loving person. Neither of us have ever dated other people before. Ive talked to her parents and her cousin (who is very close to the both of us) and they seem to think that her loving me is not the case, I never see her anymore becuse we commute an hour to college, and she decided to get a dorm room when she broke up with me. Any clues on whats going on? I really believe we are meant to be      Now she refuses to talk to me
20090226145425AA0yQM1	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I tell my husband i don't like my birthday gift?	So, here is the thing. About three months ago, I started looking for birthday gifts hoping to find the perfect one. I was looking online. I found a cross at Zales that I really liked in the beginning, I had forgotten about it by the time my birthday came around, however my husband had not. So he did get me that cross. Online the cross looked great, however.. in person... it is SOOO tiny, I don't HATE IT, but I don't really like it. I will wear it, but... i kinda wish i could have gotten something else. It hasn't been the 30 days yet, so he can still return it... should i keep my mouth shut, or tell him?

20090226140530AAWUAeW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ladies, do you know or have you?	You ever seen a girl slap a guy so he can't block her hand by standing with all her weight one side with a hand planted on her hip and then slap him good with her other hand? This girl used it on me and i would have blocked it, but i can't. That move froze me, it was like i didn't know what she was gonna do. Or have you used this on a guy before? Was he able to block it/catch your hand if you did? I hope so. I thought i could, but.....nope.

20090226144622AADuafK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think about this situation?	Me and my hubby started dating when we where 14, got married at 18 and after 4 years of marriage we are separated. Now for the details. Me and his side of the family do NOT get along. HIs mother is always crying for him to come home to her. He "cheated" on me and then I "cheated" on him ( Nothing sexual only talking) So Christmas 08 I catch him "cheating" on me. He says he wants to leave me but he never does. He wants to work it out but continue to talk to this chick. So I accept. Then Feb 09 he tells me he is done talking to other girls that he wants me and only me for the rest of his life. But the next day I look through his phone (bc he suspiciously slept with it in his sleeping shorts pocket) and I see that he still has her number programmed in his phone. I confront him and he says that he kept it in case i "messed up again" Then he flips out and says that he is not going to deal with this for the rest of his life and packs up and leaves. So now he has been gone for 3 weeks. (He usually leaves me every 3 or 6 months but comes home after a day or two bc he says he doesnt feel right without me.) He said the first week that he thought about coming home but came to realize he loves being single. This is where I am confused. He says he likes to be able to talk to any girl he wants to and not be tied down to only one. Which I understand because he never got to date any other girl besides me. So I get why he feels he missed out. But he never does anything with them only talk to them. He says because they are just friends. He has made it clear that he could work things out but chooses not to. He still meets me for lunch, talk on the phone, text. Do you think he just needs space to go out and do his thing with other girls and will eventually come back to me? I would really appreciate a man's point of view. Thanks.

Does it make sense for someone to say "I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you but Im not ready to be engaged"..       To me it doesn't make sense. if you KNOW you want to be with them, then the natural next step is to get engaged and plan to be married.        and p.s it has nothing to do with money!

20090226142925AAeM3zd	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend's boyfriend is really controlling?	My friend's boyfriend is so controlling of her! They've been going out for almost a year, and I just can't tell if she's happy anymore..   Everytime she says she wants to hang out with me and my other friends it never happens.   Usually it's because she ends up hanging out with her boyfriend.   But, really, he doesn't like us.(meaning me and my friends) So he tells her he doesn't want her hanging out with us, and she listens because she doesn't want to get him upset.   It just makes me mad that she complains to me all the time that he's a party-pooper, and he bugs her, and she really wants to hang out with us..etc.   Then she goes and says she loves him, which I do think she does.. but I also think his controlling ways are tiring not only her.. but everyone around.   What should I do about this situation? Or should I just sit back and do nothing?

I have been curious about bringing a woman home to fulfill a fantasy.  Rules would be laid down such as, not in our house, no kissing, no one we know socially, those kinds of things.

20090226140420AAfrWFs	Family & Relationships;Family	Stay home???? Or bust?	Ok, I am 18 and a few months I got into some trouble, afterwards I pulled myself together and realized I should make an effort to do something with my life. I then hastily made the decision to join the military, at the time this decision was made I was spending most of my time at home and away from my friends. My parents were super proud, I was being responsible an making an adult-like choice the same goes for my entire family and my parents, at least, told everyone they knew....Then I began to hang out with my friends again, and I quickly realized what I was leaving behind. I have so many people who love me and I'm lucky to have them why would I leave them behind? It also kills me that I wasn't able to consult with any of my friends about the military before making the choice, when I told my closest friends they cried! That may not sound too strange but these guys aren't the emotional type. I don't want to leave these people. Also I don't want to leave my family, but how can I let them down by not going? I'm in an extremely tight spot! So here I am 4DAYS from signing my 6YEAR contract with the U.S Coast Guard. Any advice?

20090226142924AAPAcli	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Opinions on this Bridesmaid/Flowers/Dress combo?	I'm looking for a few opinions on what you think of these bridesmaids dresses paired with my wedding gown and the type of flowers they/I will be carrying. All of my girls like the dress and it fits them all well, but I just kind of wanted an outside opinion on the look of the whole thing. My dress and the bridesmaid dress are by the same designer, so I like how they are similar without being exact. Please be honest, I promise you won't hurt my feelings, I'd love some constructive criticism.      This is the bridesmaids dress I'm considering: It's sort of hard to tell in the picture but the color is pale lime green.       http://i626.photobucket.com/albums/tt341...          This is my dress on the model from the designers site:       http://i626.photobucket.com/albums/tt341...

20090226143707AAAfYzd	Family & Relationships;Family	Can anyone tell me under what circumstances in the Uk, would a father be given sole custody of his 3 children?	The mother lives nearby, appears to be quite well but apparently does have some health problems.  I was just wondering why a judge would grant custody to the father in a custody battle?  I don't know this couple very well but this woman has embroiled herself into my mothers affections and I am concerned why she has lost custody of her children.    Any help would be much appreciated.  Thankyou.
20090226144014AAgpDib	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't know what this girl wants?	I was at school doing some home work in the library. I'm not so popular in class, and I don't really have any real friends in this class. I'm just small talking with them. I'm not really interested in any of them, I just got one year left before I leave school...CAN'T WAIT! Anyway I was sitting in the library doing some home work, and then this girl comes sits next to me. She is in my class, during these two years I have only spoken to her maybe 10 times or something...and then she starts talking...she starts with saying she has been up til 2am to practice for the test we had the same day. And she looks really tired, then she starts asking me what I'm gonna do after I graduate...after that she starts talking about how to cheat in tests, and stuff. And this is NOT like some normal conversation. It feels more like a interview, and she is not calm but stressed up. This freaks me out, I don't even know her last name. What does this mean, that she feels sorry for me not having any real friends in class or that she wants to get to know me or something else. I'm not sure but it's freaky....O.o I guess people in the class look at me as an outside or loner type, I don't really care. But I need to know what this means...

She seems to have alot of hostility directed at me and seems to take advantage of me quite alot. I really like her shes a really good friend but just sometimes I can't help but think about just shouting at her and walking away from her.

20090226144630AAfStso	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl is too busy for a guy in her life?	So, I met this girl on campus a few weeks ago.  We started studying together in a hall outside of a class, talked a lot, joked around, exchanged numbers.  I asked her for a date, but she said she was going out of town.  Then a few days ago, our studying in the hall escalated to arms around her, holding hands, and the touch barrier pretty much disappearing.  We hadn't kissed, but I was asking her to find out when she had time off so we could go out.        Today, I saw her again, and we studied together, but something felt different.  After a bit, I just left and went outside.  I got a text from her asking why I was upset, and it turned into a 3-4 hour long texting session.    I found out from her that she does think we're a good match, but she doesn't have time for a guy in her life because she's so busy with work and school.  We just kept texting for a few hours about all sorts of random personal stuff.  At one point, I was just referencing again becoming infatuated with a girl that seemed unavailable, and she asked me to explain to her my infatuation.  So, I just did in the texts, and told her what I liked about her.        I was just telling her I was hoping one day her busy life could include me, and she just said, "it does, tuesday and thursdays studying."  I've really liked spending time with her, and I can tell that she apparently likes me too.  What should I do?

20090226145242AAYlvOL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sister in law to be rubs her and her husbands success in our faces?	My sister in law to be is always bragging about her and her husbands success to me and my husband to be.   She is in pharmacy school and will definitely have her career set when shes done, and she will make great money. Her husband already has his career, and they are pretty well off.  She kind of rubs it in our faces how smart she is. And it upsets me because its not like i or my fiance couldn't go to pharmacy school, we are both very intelligent, but my fiance and i are very excited to have babies and another four years in school isn't as important to us.   She told us how they got this HUGE tax return when my fiance and i can barely make rent because we are both full time college students.   They never rarely come over when we invite them to our apartment because they have a house.   Part of my problem is just that i am jealous. I love her and im very happy for them, but i dont think that she realizes that we are successful in our own way too.  And we hardly ever disclose our "successes" to them because they never compare to hers and her husbands.      Has any one ever dealt with this before?   How did you handle it?
20090226153440AAClf6m	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I have sacrificed everything for him. Is this ridiculous?	My boyfriend and I live a half-hour away from each other. I drive over there every other day to spend the night with him. My job is a half-hour away from my house, too - except in the other direction from my boyfriends. Needless to say, I do a lot of driving.   He never stays over at my house because my mom won't let him. I don't really care because she's the one that pays the rent, not me. However, he doesn't come over at all because he says it's too far to drive to just have to turn around and go back home a few hours later.      I have no idea how many hundreds of dollars I have spent in gas over the past year driving to his house every other night. That is just one sacrifice that I make for him. I also transferred colleges to be closer to him. He doesn't seem to appreciate it.      Now I want us to get our own place because we can finally afford it. . .however, he is dragging his heels. He likes living at his mom's rent free, with dinner on the table every night.       He says that he loves me, but I want him to appreciate me. We are both 19, by the way.

20090226152135AAGlRsX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Accusing me of cheating...?	My boyfriend and I have recently gotten very serious and he wants to get married, which is a big step for him because he is kind of a commitment-phobe and very wary of marriage in general (parents just got a divorce after 25 years because his mother cheated on his dad). I told him I am not ready for marraige but let's keep going how we are      Recently, he has started to travel for work, and calls me all the time wanting to know where I am and who I am with. He's constantly making "jokes" about me hooking up with other guys, going to their houses, "whoring" myself, and so forth. Finally I got fed up and said he's joking about it so much I think there has to be some truth to it and does he trust me or not? I also said the accuser is often the guilty one. He said he just feels very vulnerable right now because he feels like I am not as serious about him as he is me (he said I love you first, brought up marriage first, etc.) and that's the worst thing I could do to him.       Does that sound legit or could it be him feeling guilty? I've never suspected him of cheating.

I am so not interested in anyone and probably never will be ( my husband passed away only 3 weeks ago and I am still in shock and grieving).

He also offered me a job because we both do graphic arts. I told him no to the lunch ...

20090226150538AANlmOo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you felt you may never get over a relationship? so much pain?	This has to be the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with my entire life.   I wish I am just exaggerating, but I am not. At age of 28, I thought I have found my soul mate, the love of my life. But the relationship still ends, left me with so much agony, pain, frustration, and despair.    It is like there is no more hope or no more love for me. It is like I received a death sentence in the love department.   Have you ever felt like you had found somebody who understand and desire you in every way humanly possible? Well, that was how I felt while dating my soul mate. But the relationship still ended.    I sometimes just want to stay in bed, and cry. So much pain.   What am I going to do?   Have you felt like this before?  How did you get over it?  thank you

20090226151501AAjwcds	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about my irresponsible cheapskate jerk of a father? Please read I'm really desperate for advice?	Now before you jump at the chance to say I'm being disrespectful HEAR ME OUT.      I'm 15 going on 16 in about a month and my dad has never been much of a father to me. He and my mom were never married and from the time I was a baby to about 11 or 12 years old I saw him once or twice a week at my grandmothers house because he has a serious drinking problem. I have, however, been over his house once or twice and when I did he got seriously drunk, so when I was 11, I asked him to take me to his house (my mom didn't know about this, she's the one who told him to take me to my grandma's whenever he saw me) and he got drunk out of his mind and that's a story in itself. Well, after that incident, I decided to stop seeing him and he pretty much just went with it. Now on the other hand, my half-sister has gotten MUCH more from him than I ever did. He paid for her braces, he paid for a good portion of her college tuition, and I'm pretty sure he bought her a laptop. I know this because we keep in touch...she can't stand him either however. He's complained about paying for those things because her mother has gotten into several fights with him about money but he still payed for it, probably because she demanded it. Around Christmas he called me and said "hey rach just wanted to see how you were and if you wanted anything for christmas, I know I haven't been the best dad and I'm sorry for that etc etc." It wasn't the first time he'd done something like this and in the past he always said he would change...yet he didn't even make an effort. I knew this BUT I felt sorry for him because no one really wants to be around him and he was all alone on Christmas. Well I saw him for the first time in years and obviously I was right, he didn't change, he complained even about the bill at olive garden instead of just being happy that his daughter was giving him a second chance. He also gave my sister a $200 ipod touch for Christmas and he gave me $100, now I wasn't looking for something to pick at but that's playing favoritisms in my book. My sister refuses to talk to him too, so it seems to me like he's being slightly more generous to the wrong people. About 2 years ago my aunt moved out and since than it's been MUCH harder for the people in my house financially. My mom has been in tears for a long time now almost every night because of financial problems and she and I both know my dad should be helping out, I'm his responsibility as well as hers and I'm tired of seeing my mom go through this. He SHOULD be paying her at least $400 a month and he barely gives her $170. He gets so angry if anyone brings up money, when I was younger he yelled at me because he received a hospital bill for the time I had a serious asthma attack, my mom won't let me call him because she has this notion that he'll "become violent" if it concerns money, maybe she's right but he doesn't even care about seeing me, he hasn't contacted me at all since the last time which was about a month ago now, she said SHE would call him if we don't hear from him by June but I wish she would just put her pride down and demand help from him, because it's not fair to me or to her, my mom goes out of her way to make me happy, she was crying to me last night because she doesn't know if she'll be able to afford to take me and my best friend to New York City to see Phantom of the Opera for my sweet 16 PLUS a car...even when I tell her not to she still beats herself up about it, and it's just ridiculous, it makes me all the angrier at my father...What's left?

20090226153317AAABlXS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm going with a boy after knowing him for three days. Is this to soon?	So I'd had a crush on the boy for few months, and we finally met 3 days ago. He walked me home from track practice yesterday and today. He's really sweet, and such a gentleman. And he makes me laugh. Plus he's a good kisser ; )..He asked me out today. Ladies, he actually said "will you give me the honor of being my girlfriend?" I said yes, but is it too soon??
20090225112747AAvQDts	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He still loves his ex wife but not in a sexual way?	He tells me.   He saw her 3 times last year when his kids came into the city to meet him for dinner and she happened to drive them in. We live in Jersey.  She is 8 years older than him (in her mid 50's) and my husband is 47.     He has been in contact with his kids again for 3 years now after many years of them not wanting to speak to him because they thought he would be coming back to  them eventually. I was the one who told him keep calling them and they will come around but I never knew his daugther was living on the west coast for 1 year. He never told me. His son also was in and out and he was reaching the ex and was speaking to her for 1/2 hour and hour at a time a few times a week. I never knew this until last year and I know that he has to contact his kids but if I wasn't home and my dad called to talk to us my mom said they aren't home and that was it. I told my husband I never thought you would develop a close relationship with your ex. He said I know her for over 30 years.    My husband and I have been married 13 years and I never met his kids. To this day they don't want to be bothered with me and he has left his ex wife 18 years ago.   He always been friends with her since the mid 70's. She forgave him about him leaving her (not for me.)   One day I was sitting with him watching a tv show and I said to him do you still love your ex wife. He shook his head yes but he then says not in a sexually or romantic way but more like brother and sister.    What if your husband said this to you, how would you feel?    I saw pictures of her and she looks like she is 68 not 55 so I don't feel  threatened. I just think he should keep his calls at a limit. The kids are hardly home and they can call him which they hardly do.

Then my friend said, how am I going to raise a family without a job, and he asked me if i'm going to go on welfare. There are many young couples that get married and have children. They haven't finsihed college or they have a minimum wage job. And what bout those Indian couples that get married at an early age??? How does the wife support the children?

20090225112235AA71lhS	Family & Relationships;Family	Opinions on a sister-in-law's dramatics?	My husbands younger sister (she's 23) just went through a break up with her live-in boyfriend of 2 years.  His sister is a drama queen, so when she did talk about breaking up with him beforehand it didn't really mean much to the rest of the family.      My husband and I hadn't heard from either of them in over a month...which was odd considering we live next door to my in-laws and she's invite herself over for supper every Sunday (literally, she'd call and ask 'what are you guys having?')      This morning I was browsing facebook and I noticed that her boyfriend seemed to have removed myself and our entire family from his friend's list.        I took this as him thinking that it would be impossible to be friends with the rest of us at this point, and I emailed him and told him that wasn't the case.  As a sign of good will, I invited him over to our place to hang out sometime.       I honestly had no idea just how bad of a breakup they had gone through.  My sister-in-law made it a point not to tell anyone anything.  But after her ex re-added me on facebook, she called me in a fury and told me I wasn't "allowed" to talk to him anymore.  She had the cops go to his house last night and tell him he wasn't to have any contact with her family whatsoever until "after they're through in court".  She found out I had emailed him because she knows his password and admitted to still checking his email and facebook.      I did not know any of this was going on.  I cant for the life of me figure out what might have happened between them that got the cops involved.  I can understand getting lawyers and going to court because they lived together for a few years, own things together, have some pets, credit cards, etc that need straightening out.      But WHAT could have happened that he isn't allowed to have contact with any of us?  From my understanding, she wanted to end it with him, while they were still together she cheated on him.  No one knows this but me.  Could she be trying to hide something that SHE did?  Or is it more likely that her ex did something to provoke this?  Keep in mind, until this day no one had any clue that anything was going on.      Am I at liberty to do what she says and not try to contact him?  Or should I chalk this up to her attempting to dictate who we can and can't be friends with?      What's everyone's thoughts on this?  Should I try to not get involved and do as she says and help make the poor guy's life miserable, or do I listen to my conscience and and extend a hand of friendship to him? (My husband has the same feelings as I do).      Keep in mind that dramatics follows this girl EVERYWHERE she goes.  Since I've known her since she was 13 she's been attention-whorish like this.

20090226152301AAbNohd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend issue, what should I do to him?	Please please read through.       1. Boyfriend cheated on me about a month and a half ago. Arguments and stuff happened, now we're back.      2. He promised me he'll be different and treat me better and yes he kept his promise. He's been good, kept calling me, texting, and all. And also he said and kept swearing to me that she is just a friend of his now and it's my choice to believe it or not.      3. I went to his FB, and just saw tagged pics of him with this girl, they were alone in a lake or something, and taking pics of each other, so no one was around them. They were uploded on the 17th of Feb, and I just knew about this.      4. This same girl wrote on his wall "You forgot your scarf, come get it", then I check his FB again and it was deleted. Duh?       P.S: When I told him 'bout the pics he said that yes he went out with her but just as friends and it was 2 - 3 weeks ago, but she just uploaded the pics. He also went to a sushi restaurant with her, and he only told me cos he sent me the pic of his sushi plate and he didn't realize that her purse was showing, and when he did, he said "Oh btw, she went with me, so don't think I'm lying" because basically I know that this is her purse.          I blocked him in my MSN now, because I can't stand it anymore, but please, don't tell me to leave him and move on, I can't. Any other suggestions?      P.S 2: We're in a long distance relationship, but he's coming back SOOOOO soon, so no need for the stupid act.

20090225113600AAoHPgH	Family & Relationships;Friends	So you think your a real friend???  read on?	One day, when I was a freshman in high school,      I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school.      His name was Kyle.      It looked like he was carrying all of his books.      I thought to myself, "Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday?      He must really be a nerd."      I had quite a weeken d planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.      As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him.      They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt.      His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him.      He looked >up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes      My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye.      As I handed him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks. "      They really should get lives.      " He looked at me and sa i d, "Hey thanks!"      There was a big smile on his face.      It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude.      I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived.      As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked h im why I had never seen him before.color=black>       He said he had gone to private school before now.      I would have never hung out with a private school kid before.      We talked all the way home, and I carried some of his books.      He turned out to be a pretty cool kid.      I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends      He said yes.      We hung out all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him.      Monday morning came! , and there was Kyle with the huge >stack of books again.      I stopped him and said, "Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!      " He just laughed ! and handed me half the books.      Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends.       When we were seniors, we began to think about college.      Kyle decided on Georgetown , and I was going to Duke.      I knew that we woul d always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem.      He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.      Kyle was valedictorian of our class.      I teased him all the time about being a nerd.      He had to >prepare a speech for graduation.      I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak      Graduation day, I saw Kyle.      He looked great.      He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school.      He filled out and actually looked good in glasses.      He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.      Boy, sometimes I was jealous!   Today was one of those days.      I could see that he was nervous about his speech.      So, I smacked him on the back and said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"      He loo ked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled.      " Thanks," he said.      As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began      "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years.      Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your friends...      I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them.      I am going to tell you a story."      I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met.      He had planned to kill himsel f ove r the weekend.      He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff >home.      He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.      "Thankfully, I was saved.      My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable."      I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment.      I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile.       Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.      Never underestimate the power of your actions.      With one small gesture you can change a person's life.      For better or for worse.      God puts us all in each others lives to impact one an other in some way.

I was so shocked and I was worried sick all day and told everyone about it cos it was bugging me all day as I kept thinking all of this negative stuff like 'what if he had turned around he could have punctured his stomach and died!' 'what if he bled to death?' so then I started thinking I was taking him for granted and didn't want to lose him and see him every chance I get as he could have died, all of these thoughts brought tears to my eyes.   now earlier he rung me up and I was like 'how are u darlin?' and then he was laughing loads and told me the whole thing was a joke to winds me up! I was so angry and hurt yet humiliated and stupid for thinking all of those things earlier in the day. so I had a massive go at him and asked him why would he say such a thing? then he told me I was being stupid so I hung up on him.   my mum says he's a sick immature b*****d and my dad said he's seeking my attention but he's going the wrong way about it.   what do you guys think?      by the way I'm recently turned 16 he's 18 in July.

A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes. We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away. Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me. Which is nice...in moderation.      When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today. But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30. Ok?" I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do. Anyway, what do you think?

20090225113620AAwAepF	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does anyone have an opinion on....?	How far away the ceremony and the reception site should be from each other.  My fiance and I would like to get married at the church from the town I am from it's a beautiful church.  However our reception site is 40min away.  I know that you must give yourself time for pictures and it would be nice to at least show my face at the cocktail hour (but that's not a huge deal as long as I get to my reception on time).  Does anyone think that I should look into the church closer (which is where my fiance went as a child) which probably takes half the time to get to or even just have it at the reception site?  I know it's 'Our Day" but at the same time I don't want my guests to be put off by this.  I should also add that the reception site is a hotel so it's not like everyone would have to drive home that day.  I guess besides the guests is that with how long pictures take is it worth it to have the reception almost an hour away.  All Opinions greatly appreciated.
20090225111916AAkwAKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm getting abuse from a younger girl, What do i do?	She approaches me and my friend with a big group when we're in the park, often we practice for cheerleading because its the best place really. Then she says we're **** and that she can do way better as she would demonstrate in front of her friends, is she playing to the crowd? does she do it to make her self look big? This ain't even half of it! She verbally abuses us but we can fight back on that one because we're witty and she's quite a dummy :P The worst thing is she that she picked me up then dropped me flat on my *** on the floor in front of her friends where they all laughed at me, 2 days later the same thing happened to me friend Becky who is taller and even heavier than me. How can i deal with this situation? I don't want to admit i am being bullied or harassed by a kid who's like 4 years younger than me. Becky tried struggling when she picked her up because she already did it to me but the girl still managed to get her off the floor and drop her on her butt.   Why does she do this? is it to show off to her friends that she can pick on older and bigger girls? i don't wanna get bullied for being physically weaker than smaller and younger girl either! i hate this please help me :(
20090225113855AAqEDso	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Family and marriage problems? HELP!!?	When i married my husband he paid for all the wedding (which cost 10,000). Since the very beginning he said he was gonna pay for everything but my parents told him that if we wait a little longer that they would be able to help some but he wanted to marry me right away so he said no. Now after 21/2 years i just start doing my immigration papers which is going to cost close to $1,800 and my husband's parents are saying, "why isn't her parents paying for it?" they think at least they should help some since they didn't pay for some of the wedding costs but that's not my parents fault they did offer. None of the 4 of us are doing well economically but my question is, is it my parents responsibility to pay for my papers now that i'm married?? I told my husband that now that we are married all debts, and bills, etc are our problems not anybody else's problems and i think the last time a parent pay for their children is in their wedding not after the wedding. What do you people think? i need some advice.
20090226151343AAxOpVh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband thinks I'm going to cheat on him?	I've always been a stay at home wifey, but now with the recession and my husband getting a paycut in his salary, I recently had to find a job. I'm happy about it. I like to get out the house everyday and I finally get to use my degree that I worked so hard for. Plus the kids are all in school now so they don't need me around 24/7..      But now my husband is totally paranoid and obsessed with the fact that I leave the house now. He thinks just because I'm not *always* at home like before that I'm going to cheat on him or find someone else and leave him, It's absurd. .. He said to me that he doesn't like not having me at home and that it's weird for him. Weird? More like he's scaring me with his obsession of where I am all the time. Hello controlling.      So he wants me to quit the job and take on my formal role of wifey. Not going to happen. How can we get through this?

20090226152003AA3taUF	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this extremly rude, or am I overreacting?	My parents and I had a large fight, involving of them making accusations in which I have said various things about the family.       They heard this all second hand from being passed around, then to an unreliable source.         One of the things I allegedly said was that their house is filthy and the cats pee in the toaster. I thought they were joking at first, and replied "oh of course, and that leprechauns also protect the brown gold in the toilet." It didn't go down well.      They decided the "best" thing to do was - disown me! They refused to have anything do with me and planned to move, as the "whole family" have betrayed them. I was more hurt, in that they refused to have anything to do with my two year old. I moved back to the same city so he could grow up around his grandparents. My son LOVES them, and I was sure it was the same back.      Now they have realised they have been quite the fool and I'm still furious they would do that to my son. I will let them come see him, but I refuse to talk to them. Am I overreacting? I don't know what I should be doing - I can "forgive" them, but I'm not sure I can forget...

My boyfriend of 2 months tells me he loves me and I tell him it too. I just dont say it to say it, i really feel like i love him so much. He did something (said he was attracted to another girl, broke up with me, 2 days later came back saying it was a mistake and he is sorry and truely loves me) and now he's lost my trust and i dont know what to think.   When he told me he loved me, he was dead serious and looked into my eyes. But he could just be B.S.ing.    I wanna believe him, I do but should I?      Oh and i want to say to him, if you love me like you say, tell me why. (in the past he would just say, i dont know why but i just do) and if he really does, he should come up with an answer, right?!
20090225112142AAnGteZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is emotionally distant & doesnt take care of me the way I expect.?	We have been married for a long time and have a kid. I dont want to leave him, but sometimes feel very hurt with his behavior. Whenever I need him he simply refuses...be it any household thing or something for the kid. I am a very emotional person and when I get hurt, I tend to react and abuse him verbally. All this further spoils our relationship. I dont know how to bottle up my feelings and just live with it. I have tried everything to make things work but somehow he just lets me down and I react. He is a nice guy but emotionally detached from us.I always try to take good care of him but when its my turn he doesnt really feel anhything.  Please suggest what should I do? What should I do so that I can control my anger n hurt?

He said that we had changed too much and that we will barely get to see each other as i start uni next week and he starts a new job. I love him more than i have ever loved anyone, and though it was only a short relationship (6months), he lived with me before that.

My gf and I have been dating about 2 months. We just got back from a really terrible Vegas trip.

I've pretty much forgotten about the whole thing and am ready to go on as usual, but now she tells me she wants to slow things down and needs some space. I'm not clingy or asking her to move in with me or anything. Things were pretty good up to the trip. she gets moody from time to time, but things had generally been good and we had a great valentine's day. Despite all that, am i dumped? Is this unrepairable? What should I do? I was going to wait about a week and then send flowers and chocolates...

20090226151614AAwB7Gj	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do with my grandmother?	My grandmother is a horrible person. She treats everyone like crap; even people she dosen't even know. My mom's always taking her side and my grandmother makes my mom feel like shes worthless. My whole life we always had to help her (grandmother) move her stuff to the other side of the country. She always had to use us and she would never stop following us. She always says that she wants to live alone; but she keeps moving in with us. I know grandmothers from america are great, maybe other grandmothers outside the us are great too. But she's not from here she's from holland.   She has the nerve to say that americans are stupid there not normal stuff like that and she dosen't like it here when she has lived here for 40 years. Her country takes 15 min to found a house that's burning and can't even put out a fire; and she thinks that's normal. I always defend my country and the people inside it; she has no right to say that about anyone.   (I'D TELL YOU MORE, BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE)      What should I do????       PS: Do not right an answer saying that your horrible for this or anything because she hurt my family all our life and I'm going to get even. I know life's to short but I dont know what to do anymore.   I will report you if you say mean things you don't know what it's like to live with this creature.

20090226150209AA1R41S	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it bad if i dont want to go  home?	Every time i leave my house/ get away from my mother, i feel a huge stress release.  I am so much calmer and happier when i am away from her.  I know almost every teenager gets to a point that they "hate" their parents but I am 18 years old, I am very responsible, I have NEVER given them any reason to not trust me.  I am an only child and my mother is very protective of me!  I got my first boyfriend last spring, when i was 17 and i turned him down 3 times... because i was scared to ask my mom if i could go on a date!  I really want her to let go of me but she isn't!  From the outside our mother daughter relationship looks picture perfect! But in reality I want nothing more than to get away from her... and if i even give her my opinion on something she thinks i have an attitude problem and yells at me.  I just have to shut up and listen to her when she is yelling at me because if i dare speak she gets even more mad at me.  I've even become numb to some of her yelling cause it has always been this way since i was a little girl.  I am spoiled and i know i couldn't survive with out my parents but because i have been so sheltered and taken care of I am petrified to go off on my own (but really excited that I will be getting away from her!)  I think that by her not teaching me to do things like laundry that she has hurt me cause i cant even to that on my own.  I have all my stuff packed for college and it doesn't start until the fall! (does that tell you how excited I am to get away from her)  She also blames my boyfriend for the changes in my life... like my outlook on life, my dreams, i'm no longer materialistic, and I'm just happier.  But every time i have to head home i feel sick to my stomach and want to turn around.  She calls me all the time and makes me tell her every detail of my life... every time i talk to my boyfriend on webcam she has to ask me what we re talking about.  I have alot of anger and stress built up from her and I know I never am going to put my kids in this situation.      So is there anything wrong here or is this just normal teenager parent issues?  I've talked to friends and they all think it is something more.

20090225112908AAa3Erc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ive Known this girl long enough- so Now what?	I’ve known this girl for almost two years, and we’ve been good friends, although we don’t see a lot of each other but only at our drama classes, over the years we have got closer as friends, and last year we ended up helping each other through each others problems because both people we liked were going out together. The closer we were getting - little thoughts of us getting together occurred to me-but I put them aside. And other people thought we might get together because we were so close.  Slowly I started to get jealous of the lads she was seeing, which never happened before. And I started seeing the other side of it. I think she did as well, but I think she doesn’t to spoil our friendship for something more. We went out to the cinema last week and it was great (also the first time we’ve done something us two together), but I found out that she is still likes on the lad from last year, but he has a girl friend and still flirts with her. When we went back to drama when we were all together and he was flirting with her, I was sad. Should I feel put off? Should I push for her? Help?
20090225112946AAwSrYl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please help friend... should he be totally betrayed or no big deal.?	Please be serious here.  My best friend in Florida was married six months ago and is totally devastated because he just found some letters from his wife and an ex that she had a serious relationship with.  Not just sexually but romantically before they were married.  He did not know about the relationship but found out about it this week and the problem comes in that the relationship his wife had was with another women.  My friend is a southern man who is sad to know this, especially because she never told him.  He feels this was a lie.  I agree but want to see what you all think.      She is more upset that he read the letters saying it is an invasion of privacy... but then again when you are married you are supposed to be "one" with the other person... with secrets like these to be out in the open.

20090225113153AAxRBeo	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I let it go, I love him?	I am a single mother who just got back into the dating seen.  I started dating a guy in August of last year and up until last month it was okay.  A month after I meet him he lost his job so he continued school full time.  So we really haven't gone out much due to the lack of his funds.  Because our schedules are so different we don't spend much time on the phone.  Recently every time i try to plan an activity for us to do he "forgets" or he has something else to do.  I recently said that I think that we should focus on our friendship because I felt like I was getting hurt all the time. He said that it was good but he still wanted a relationship he was just trying to get it together.  His grand father passed away this past weekend and now he is acting like me calling is a sin ot that I am bothering him.  I know that he is greiving but I feel like I should make an exit because he has not called and he never even bothered to tell me where the funeral was.  I am just so fustrated and I am annoyed I let my child meet him....please any advice for me?

20090225113351AAxRMFR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he for real this time? I don't know what to do :(?	We have been together for 5 months, but that includes a month when we were broken up.      On Monday, the first time we hung out since our break up, he looked me in the eyes and said, I'm going to marry you one day.      He said he had me come over at first only as friends, just to talk and hang out, but he can tell in my eyes that I really do care about him and that I never had that look in my eyes before, and he can feel something there between us that wasnt there before      and he said things such as, "i've never felt like this about anyone before, not even my ex" (and the reason he said his ex is because they were together for 2 years)      He told me how he was moving out of the state in 4 years and said, "you're coming with me, right?"      He never was like this with me before. I dont know if it was because of being broken up for a month or what?      But he apologized and kept saying that we will always be together and even if he has bad days or days when he is distant, for me to just stick by his side.      sigh...      a guy wouldn't say all this if he didn't mean it, right????

20090226145843AACEBrG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is sex once a week or every two weeks bad?	If 7 to 14 days pass and me and my boyfriend of two years don't have sex, my boyfriend starts to act different. It's like he doesn't talk to me much and seems upset about something. He doesn't tell me he's upset but I know he is because he's done this before. Then we start to argue when I ask him about it and he tells me that I'm acting different and not giving him attention like I did before. When he says "attention" I know he means sex. Is sex once a week or every two weeks bad? Sometimes I'm just tired or not in the mood. He acts like a year has gone by without sex. I'm just not as horny as he is. If it were up to him we'd be having sex everyday maybe even more than once a day. All of this makes me feel bad. I feel like I don't satisfy him enough. Any thoughts?

When I try to sit at the table his "so-called friends" and him tell me to get lost and go away and so did he! After lunch he pretends like he's my friend again. After 2 weeks I was so fed up with him I told him "don't talk to me anymore", and we haven't spoke for 4 weeks. I want to apologize but I think he should too. I want to be friends with him but have things the way they we're at the height of are friendship.

20090226151039AA8aiBC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I have a good chance of getting custody of my two boys?	My wife and I have decided to get a divorce and now I am trying to get custody of my two boys ASAP. My wife has tried to commit suicide 3 times in the past two months and has threatened to do so twice more within the same time period. She has been hospitalized three times for the suicide attempts/threats and was diagnosed with severe depression the last stay. She has been the primary financial supporter of the family and decided to quit her job two weeks ago and move out, putting the two kids at risk of not having a place to live although they will because I will provide a house for them. She is very unstable and she scares me. I went back to school about a year and a half ago when are youngest was born and it was something we both agreed to, so I have been the primary care taker for our two boys for 16 months and I am the one they are more emotionally attached to. My only concern is when I got back from Iraq 3 years ago I went through a period of over drinking. I drank alcohol quite often for 5 months or so but that was back in 2006. Should I have anything to fear going into court for a temporary custody order or do you think I am in good shape to recieve custody?

20090226150641AAD9qJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rules of asking out someone you don't know?	I'm sure this has been a question that's been asked and answered but I thought a little personal touch would change it up. To start, I should tell you guys that I am an extremely shy guy. I am not so when I know the people i hang out with but its the getting to know them part that's hard for me. To cut to the chase, I am a college student and there is this amazingly, gorgeous girl in my history class. I haven't spoken to her but I'm pretty sure she knows who I am just by seeing me 3 times a week. Now, I wouldn't ask this question if I knew I didn't have a shot but I think I do. Considering the fact that I fear greatly the chance of being rejected...should I approach her and introduce myself after class and maybe ask to hangout? Get a number and start flirting through text? I have been hurt by previous gfs and stuff so its been a while since I had one but I know that once I find the one, it'll be great. So my question to ya'll is how do I go about trying to have an opportunity to be with this girl if I don't know her? or do I not try at all. SERIOUS ANSWERS PLEASE. Need some motivation boosts and stuff haha.. THANK YOU TO ALL!

20090226150859AAtmnTe	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should be my next move?	Alright, this is a little different story.  You'll need it to give an educated answer.  Around 5 or 6 months ago, my world fell to pieces.  Tension was already on the rise between me and my friends due to the third reunion of me and my now ex-girlfriend, but I didn't expect the events of late October to December, 2008.  The girl in question had been my girlfriend two times before, and my friends had tolerated the first and second times pretty well, even though they didn't necessarily think we should be together due to the age difference.  The third time we got together brought chaos among my friends and I, and other grievances a couple of them had with me were coaxed out by this outrageous event in the process.  On October 25th, 2008 I was pretty much banished from hanging out with my friends because they didn't want me hurting them anymore (I had unwittingly caused sadness to one of my good friends, and her best friend couldn't stand for that).  In the subsequent weeks it only got worse.  Alone, I wandered about at lunch (all these events took place at school, by the way) instead of happily laughing and messing around with my friends as I usually did.  I made new friends and strengthened relationships with friends I already had, and they're great, but I also couldn't seem to let go of my old friends since we were so close.  The loss of my best friends sent me into a deep depression, and I contemplated suicide many times.  My parents noticed this and I was diagnosed with clinical depression by a psychologist, which didn't help how I felt towards my friends.  I tried to plead my case multiple times, and in doing so I won at least the partial friendship back from 4 of the 7 that had lost all trust and faith in me.  The remaining three are the most stubborn, and two of them are not only a couple of my closest friends, but extremely influential, and they seem to keep the others at bay from becoming full friends with me again.  The biggest point that they're using is that I indeed indirectly threatened death or severe injury on those three, though they all know me well enough to know that I would never do something like that, though they also know me well enough to know that I am unpredictable at times.  I've done my best to explain that a lot of confusion led me to say such a thing, and I've gone to therapy, and completely redirected my attitude, so they should at least give me another chance.  The thing is they've also threatened death upon me if I keep trying to fight back (even if it is peacefully), and even though I know they couldn't get away with my death, they can issue a restraining order, which would keep me from being friends with them again forever.  It seems now that the best course of action is to let go of them and live on, because if they're doing things like that I don't deserve them or they don't deserve me, but I just can't shake the feeling that if I try hard enough I can persuade them otherwise and help them see that this issue is not nearly as big as any of us are making it.  I want them to keep the past behind them and start over with me, while at least keeping the past in mind so we can all prevent this from happening again.  I'm afraid to approach my friends, however, because I don't know what they'll do, and it's 3 against 1.  With all that, do you have a suggestion on what I can do?

This awesome guy and I have been friends for a long long time. Well we recently got together because we felt like we belong together. Anyways, before I said I love you to a guy after 4 months of dating and then I just became his girlfriend right away, we were not friends. I was young like a teen. Anywhoo, this guy that I am seeing right now, I have been friends with for like 3 years and we finally decided to see each other. Well..I loved him for like two years. We are so much like each other same intrests and everything. We talk all the time, go on lil fun dates. It is great! When should I tell him how I feel? I am scared I will scare him away like I did in the past. He is such a fantastic guy I dont want to lose him.

20090226153126AAmxJmF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this is complicated?	im 19 and recently ive found a new friend. im gay and i dont know if he is or isn;t and this is killing me. i truly am in love with him but this is my problem. i think he isnt gay because 1) i talked with him about girls, 2) hes told me he did everything with a girl but sex, (but that could be a lie), 3) hes an amazing athlete, and loves golf and hockey. on the other hand, i think he is gay because of the following. 1) we have this inside joke that were gay and in love, so we call eachother baby, and all that stuff. 2) the other night we got drunk together and he wa telling everyone about our gay joke. 3) that same night i think we hugged like 40 times, saying were the bestest friends ever.       the problem is that im just so confused. like i really like him but i dont peak to him every time he goes on msn, and i dont bbm him every day because i try and keep my distance. but when he signs online he starts talkign to me but seems kind of not into it. like he isnnt very personal. if he were gay wouldnt he want to speak to me every day and every second just like i want to speak to him????       i dont know what to do and how to disipher this. i cant just tell him im gay because im too shy and scared of him knowing if he is straight. i dont want to scare him off. i just want to touch his body and feel his lips and spend every second of my life with him.

20090226153535AABNkle	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who does this boy like?	ok so there is this boy who is one of my best friends, and he has liked my friend for a while and so a little while back i spent loads of time helping them get together and eventually it worked. They were dating for a little and then broke up (she broke up with him). everything seemed cool and all.       and i guess during the past 2 weeks he's been acting a little differently around me, it seems like he's been hinting at things, by asking me if i like anyone, or who would i date out of everyone i know right now...and he was always like 'if u tell me who it is i'll tell you' and stuff like that. he's really sweet and all but i couldn't figure out if whatever he was saying meant anything or he was just being friendly..we do have a really friendly relationship, but this just seemed different. anyways so everyone kept saying he liked me. So even when him and my friend were dating he always came up and hugged me, picked me off the ground and stuff like that.   but now over the past week or so he's totally changed. he's keeps thinking/talking bout my friend who he dated, he seems to find reasons to go see her and is being really secretive about things. it seems like he's trying to get back together with her.   So him, my friend and me talk a ton, almost everyday. me and him have tons in common and we are best friends. so i'm not sure what's up...      anyways i just want to know if anyone has an idea of what this boy is thinking? is he just confused and still really likes my friend? (we are all 16 btw)      what do you guys think?
20090226154456AAeWnCe	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help with a wedding menu!! deciding what to serve!?	ok, so my fiance and i are having a small wedding of about 50 people total.  its going to be in a VERY nice park shelter (seriously, our park district is amazing, so any of you who are going to say "ew, park weddings are tacky", please save it).  its in august of this year      now, our issue is what to serve for food?  the wedding is going to be late afternoon (we're thinking ceremony around 2), and since we're doing the ceremony in the same park that the reception is in, our guests would have to walk maybe three minutes to get to the reception place, so food will be like, RIGHT after that....      so what do we serve?  because with normal catererers, the fewer people you have, the higher the price seems to go (its $14 a head with most of the catererers near here for parties under 100)  could we maybe get away with doing just appitizers? like, have four or five differant appitizers, and then a salad, beverages, and dessert?  or should we try to serve a full meal?  and if so, what kind of meal do you think would be appropriate? because there is an italian resturant near us that caters and does lasagna in pans, but that seems to heavy for a summer wedding...        help please? any opinions or suggestions on how we can cut costs on caterers, what types of food we should serve, and should we do just appitizers or a full meal?

My monthly water bill has more than doubled and I think the 25 minute showers he and his son take are too long and wasteful.

Would like to hear opinions on this issue.

20090226154048AA3gOZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why this girl trampled on my back and laughed?	Last day, I'd play in my friends back yard. There was a circle swing hanging from this tree and we used to tie the bungie rope so that the swing was real high of the ground. so the girls would have trouble getting on.    This is when I knee led down and offered to let this girl use my back as a step. This girl wore cowgirl boots and when she stepped on my back it hurt real bad!    She seemed to enjoy it. She laughed and pretended to lose her balance and jumped up missing the swing landing on my back!!. That hurted me!    She laughed and said she was ok. Then she smiled and said me that be careful next time.    Why she did this? I really don't know.    I think she wanted to see how long I would let my self be crushed under her cowgirl boots.    Or maybe she likes me?    What do you think?

I am a 25-year old woman who is stuck in a bad situation. I have been with my boyfriend since 2004. I moved to his state because he asked me to, because he wanted to get married. That was in 2006. From the I came to his place, he's been saying he is scared. I am now pressing him to make up his mind, because I'm falling out of love for him. He tells me that I am his everything, he can't imagine himself without me, he would kill him to see me with someone else. But still not sure if wants to marry me. He says he loves me, that he can't and doesn't want to lose me to someone else... But still don't have that thing to push him to marry me. He is scared that I will leave him... And he say he is not even sure what love REALLY is! He just know he loves me nd can't live without me... But I am really falling out of love. we've arguing a lot about the whole situation and I'm simply tired of it. I am not sure what to do either. I am so scared to go out there and get hurt worst than I already am. I look good and smart. I could be Robin Givens' twin, with Beyonce's body, with a BS in Accounting/Finance; but most guys are interested in my body. I meet other people but they only want to have sex and that's not like me to be sleeping with guys. I have only been in that ONE relationship... What would you do!

I don't know why I lied.. part of me belives its because I have never had any friends that I didn't have to lie to in order to seem interesting to them.... but another part is telling me that my first "reason" is bullshit, and I really had no reason to lie to her...      A while ago, I couldn't take it anymore, and I came clean to her, confessing to everything. She was shocked, hurt, but strangely calm. She said we could be okay, and we had to live in the present. Now she's saying she doesnt know if I can be forgiven...      I'm broken up over this. I honestly feel like my heart has been shattered, because I really, honestly love her more than anything and anyone else in the entire world. I would die for her, and the majority of my pain is caused by the fact that I hurt her so much and that I'll never have the chance to make it right....      What do you think..? Don't filter or censor your responses, let fly. Do I deserve another chance.... or do I deserve all of the pain I'm feeling, and should I just let her go and let her get on with life...?

I have no idea what to put for the cover, wordwise   And he's a pretty serious guy so I don't wanna put something cliche like, "shes in a better place now"   This is for a 9th and 10th grade class so i need it to sound like it was made by a 10th grader.   It needs emotion and deepness to it.   Thanks so much :]

I'm a 17 year old guy turning 18 in the summer, but my mother infuriates me by referring to me as an "18 year old man" rather than a "17 year old boy" (parents like to call me the age I'm going to be turning soon) She's not even joking and hasn't referred to me as a 'boy' or 'kid' in since my senior year began.      It just feels like they're trying to squash the youth out of me. ._.
20090226095352AAExrUF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In Straight Womens' mind, is there a difference between Me(Real man)who is impotent and a Fem To MaleTransexl?	I think women would say there is no difference.    Many  transexuals take testerone and they look like guys( kind of)so, do Women consider them men and would date them with no problem.      Especially, if you had a choice between me who was born male but I'm impotent vs A FtMale transexual.....would it make a difference in your eyes?        I think most women think that the genitalia doesn't even make a man a man. I've heard people here in yahoo answers say that.. That means, Straight women would date Female To Male transexuals right?      I'm 29 by the way, just had this question
20090226095356AAZR62n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he want me just for sex?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a month, and he already is wanting to feel and touch me down there. I tell him no, and he honestly respects that. He asks when he starts to do something if he is going to far. If I say yes he will stop immediatly and not do it again until another time. If I say no, he will continue to do it.       I think I'm falling head over heels for this boy, and he seems to love me a lot too.      But he is a lot more expierenced with a lot of this sorta stuff and I'm not. He's gone far with one other girl, but still a virgin. I don't get pressured into things easily but I still dont know if he loves me for me, or is just using me for sex.      He loves me a lot, he writes poems about me and long stories. He remembers the day we got together, he is a great boyfriend.   I'm still confused though.
