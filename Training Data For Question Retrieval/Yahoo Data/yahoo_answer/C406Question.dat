So my buddy dropped me off a big ol' bag of cannabis clippings, with assorted buds that I'll have to pick through at some point.      He told me to stick in a piece of lettuce in the bag for awhile to let it moisten it up, I believe. Well, I don't feel like going to the store for lettuce..      But I do have an orange peel... I've heard this works to help re-moisten dried skuff and buds, though I've heard leaving it in too long can cause mold to grow.       But I was only thinking an hour or two...      Anyway... any suggestions/feedback/comments?      Any and all positive feedback is appreciated.      Thanks.      -Daveeeeeeed-

20090223135557AA3TwcI	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Best non-toxic weed removal method?	Hello- I want to do something for my mother's yard, it is a dirt yard currently over-run by weeds. The dirt is very dry (we live in Arizona) and hard enough so that the weeds don't pull out very easily.    I want to remove the weeds but don't want to use anything toxic that will kill wildlife- my mother feeds birds and small furry animals out there, so chemical weedkiller is out of the question.    Does that mean I'll have to dig every weed out by hand? I've always been under the impression that if you just chop the weeds down they will grow back since the roots are still there.    (I'm having some rocks and various plants put in afterward, so I just need something that will take care of the weeds that are currently there, I'm not worried so much about them recurring afterward).

I have an X-Pole stripper pole for fitness and entertaining the hubby sometimes ;)       The pole left ugly brown rings on the ceiling of my apartment and I am moving out soon. I want my deposit back, and I don't want to explain that I have a stripper pole, because I am just moving to bigger apartment in the same complex, and I don't want everyone to know about it (she talks a lot!) Plus, I don't want her to tell me that I cannot put my pole up in my new apartment.       I tried scrubbing them off with bleach and a copper scrubber, but they are stained pretty good.       Do you think I can get a paint chip, take it to home depot and have them make me just a little amount of matching paint? Would that be expensive? Would it look obvious that I painted over something?      If I cannot get rid of it myself, can I lie and say it is from something else? I am thinking of saying its from a light that suctions on, because there are no hardware holes, because the pole used pressure to stay in place. Maybe I can make some screw holes in certain areas to make the light story more believable?       Maybe you have an idea of what I can say the rings are from, or a way to get rid of them?       This is pretty important, and your feedback will be greatly appreciated.       Thanks!!      p.s. Here is a pic of the ugly rings:       http://s287.photobucket.com/albums/ll138...

20090223151535AAGXuXT	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Do I need that much money to achieve my dream?	I'm in college now but sometimes I wonder if it's even worth it if it won't help me achieve my dream. My dream is to live in a house (doesn't matter what size) with nothing but rolling hills as far as the eye can see, secluded from society, or something like this:    http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2719...    I'm not sure if there's place like that in the US, if so I'll have to move. I just want to live there in peace, own a couple of dogs, maybe a Wheaten Terrier and Collie, and adopt a bunch of rabbits and guinea pigs. They can graze on the hills and I can run around on the hills and play with my dogs. I'd probably need to find a husband to help me with hunting and house repairs, and I could grow vegetables. Or I could just order my food off the internet. Sure the vet trips could get expensive, but if I just have a small house that's not on lakefront property (not to mention in a country where it rains all the time...wouldn't you get a discount or bribe for living in unfavorable weather like they do in Alaska?), how expensive could it be? I'm probably going to be getting a bunch of smartas s answers for this but it's worth a shot.

20070506131058AAR7SRd	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	?Qué alternativas nuevas existen para resolver el tema de la calefacción con seguridad e higiene?	?Existen algunas alternativas de calefactores que no sean de tiro balanceado que reúnan requisitos de seguridad y salubridad?    Resulta difícil encontrar un lugar en el que romper la pared para colocar uno de tiro balanceado. La idea es que pueda quedar encendido durante el sue?o sin representar algún tipo de riesgo para la salud o la seguridad (explosiones, etc.)   Estuve buscando por Internet y no encuentro alternativas salvo las de aire acondicioando calor- frío, pero son carísmos tanto por el precio del artefacto como por el consumo de energía. También me pregunto cuál es la relación calorías-metro cuadrado. Si alguien resolvió el tema o tiene información lo agradecería mucho. Aclaro que se trata de un departamento y no de una casa.
