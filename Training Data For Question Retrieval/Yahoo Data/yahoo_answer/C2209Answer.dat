It has a lot of the feel of Habbo, but just classier.  You can also turn into a fairy, a mermaid, a wolf and even ride horses.  They have a television in the game that you can put in your room and watch videos that players have uploaded.  They even show movies.  It is also a great place to chat and make friends as it is for the entire family.  <br>  <br>  Barbie Girls (barbiegirls.com) also has the same feel as Habbo, but it is definitely pink and for girls.  It is also very safe.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind paying, you might want to check out Dizzywood (dizzywood.com).  It is not so much like Habbo, but has some interesting features and again is a safe place to chat and make friends. <br>  <br>  I hope one of these works for you.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Those were "Dream Fastpasses", they were one of the prizes given away during the Year of a Million Dreams promotion. This ended on 12/31/2008.  Starting 1/1/2009, in conjunction with this year's What will you celebrate promotion, they do have Birthday Fastpasses.  These are for guests who either have a Multi-Day or Annual Passport, and select these as an alternate gift instead of the free entry.  If you get these, it depends on the day as to how many and which attractions you get them for.<br>  <br>  On top of these they do have regular FastPasses.  This is a free service where you use your regular Park Ticket to hold your place in line on select rides.  On rides that have it you use your park ticket and get a return time for later in the day, where you can skip the regular line and have a minimal wait.|`|43zXRpLYaa	If your Annual Passport is not blocked out and is valid for admission on your birthday in 2009, you can choose one of these birthday treats:<br>  <br>  ? A birthday fun card with a value equal to the price of a 1-Day/1-Park Disneyland? Resort Ticket* to be used at participating locations for certain purchases including select merchandise, Disney's PhotoPass? on-site services, and tour experiences; or<br>  ? A 1-Day/1-Park Disneyland? Resort Ticket for you to use any time until your next birthday; or<br>  ? A special birthday FASTPASS?** ticket for select attractions at the Theme Park you visit on your birthday.<br>  <br>  **The number of birthday FASTPASS? tickets issued is limited and may not be available after 11am. Valid Theme Park admission is required. Use of birthday FASTPASS? ticket is restricted to the celebrant and up to 5 members of his/her party.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/ap/gated/landing?name=AP_PHBirthday_SpecialOfferPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...</a>|`|qq4Da51jaa	those fast passes were for the year of a million dreams promotion. <br>  they were a prize that were handed out to lucky families by the cast members. <br>  <br>  you cannot buy them. <br>  <br>  this year if you go there on your b-day you can opt to get a b-day fastpass instead of free park admission. (the b-day fast pass is basically the same thing as the dream fast pass)<br>  <br>  other than taht you will just have to use the free fastpass systme like everyone else.|`|l7tijAohaa	I believe those were distributed to a lucky few each day as part of the "Year of a Million Dreams" event. I don't believe they are doing that anymore. You can always use the regular fast passes for free though!

154dzJ1Faa	Natural white is best for any pattern with texture.  Any cables or running stitches, or knit-purl combinations are best since that will show off the texture of the knitting.  Dark colours cover up a lot of texture, and variegated yarns hide any patterns completely.  That is why Aran patterns used white or very light colours.
xbQnBAdIaa	Well believe me, I am sure that once they arrive they will want to get on all the rides just from the excitement. But if they really don't want to get on all the roller coaster rides then there are still plenty of shows and smaller rides. And you shouldn't have them get on a roller coaster first. Let them get comfortable on the smaller stuff before u get them to try a roller coaster. I just went for 5 days to Disneyland and had a blast. Hope your family has the same experience.|`|IGXE3aDraa	this is just sad. back in the day,... yeah i'll spare you but seriously the first roller coaster they get on they will have a different view. good luck|`|8FbZO0oxaa	Well What i did for my lil sibs is tell them to cover their eyes. Most of the rides there arent scary. but if they dont want to go on a certain ride, its fine. dont force them. but when you go there, they will soon remember something and will want to go on it.<br>  <br>  hope it helpz!|`|nLyvfSDPaa	Hey!<br>  I love Disneyland! We go every year! OK you shouldn't FORCE the kids to go on the rides, but you need to persuade them. Tell them that it is so fun. Disneyland is such a safe place nothing will happen to them. They will LOVE IT. As for what to bring, sunscreen, backpack with your belongings, a good type of clothing for the weather that is expected, and some snacks. oh yeah - MONEY!!!<br>  Bye have fun!|`|Or2D4VLGaa	when you wakk in the main catle theres not a lot of scary rides  and if your kid doesent like scary ride then i would wanna go some place else like beaches, great wolf lodge ,waterparks, uh universal studios sand dieago zoo is fun too|`|BybQUHLSaa	try the girls scout helping technique, make them try one roller-coaster or 'scary' ride and it will have an affect on them. i would recommend NOT doing the tower of terror as their first scary ride...|`|tzqbxZqraa	Start them off with a kiddy coaster, such as Gadget's Go Coaster. If they are OK with that go to one a little bit scarier like The Matterhorn Bobsleds and work your way up from there. Another thing that always comforted me as a little one was when my dad told me, "If you don't like it, you never have to go on it again. As for the long drive, try to get them to bed late the night before and get them up early the morning of the trip so that they will sleep most of the way. If that does not work, bring a portable DVD player.|`|xN29zstYaa	If they are around 10 years old (or younger), I would go on one without them and show them how much fun it was.<br>  If they are older, you could do what my sister did and trick them and just tell them its a kiddie coaster (:<br>  or promise them that if they go on, they get to meet Mickey, which is easy to do.<br>  for road trip ideas, go to<br>  www.momsminivan.com<br>  there are also tips for disney in the center of the page.|`|AWzk9DWnaa	The Disneyland website has a great travel package that allows you to visit both parks and stay at some of the best hotels.

wyvSAhtZaa	Even though no roller coaster is currently taller than 500 feet (456 feet, to be exact), the term "mega coaster" is used for a roller coaster between 500-599 feet in height.<br>  <br>  A mega coaster is between 500-599 feet.<br>  A strata coaster is between 400-499 feet (like you said).<br>  A giga coaster is between 300-399 feet.<br>  A hyper coaster is between 200-299 feet.|`|e3pw1zTPaa	Not yet, the tallest coaster is 456 feet tall, soon enough though there will probably be a coaster over 500.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	There were no silver dollars made in 1985 and only the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary dollar was made that year with Columbus on it. The gold color dollar from 2000 has to be a Sacagawea dollar and it is not made of gold but manganese brass. It is common with a mintage of 767,140,000 from the Philly mint and 518,916,000 from the Denver mint. The 1985 item may be a token of some kind as well as the 1992 if it is not what I mentioned above. Would need to know what is on both sides of the items to help further.

At school, I'm in building with books (really fun service club- i'd look for any service clubs at your school), environmental club (it can be fun), art club, anime club, film club, and i'm trying out water polo even though I'm not really athletic. This summer i might try interning, and then working as soon as i can. (Talk to your counselor about volunteering and maybe interning when you get a little older.) But this is just me. <br>  <br>  Try the things you already tried again, and see where you go from there. You might like them, or you might go for something completely different.

PmaB839Naa	You will have a great time. Sure there are rides for little kids but most are for older ones. It is not just the rides but the feeling you get being there. I went the second day it opened and have been back so many times I can't count. I don't live close like I use to but when I get down there I always go. I enjoy taking people there that have never been. I am 63. Are grad night from High school spent the night there till four in the morning.

I went to Disneyworld though, and<br>  we went to Animal Kingdom, and Epcot. I don't know what they have at<br>  the Disneyland Florida, but when I was in Florida with my dad, there were<br>  these maps inside the hotel that showed all the parks,names of the attractions, and descriptions of everything. The hotel wasn't owned by Disney, and they had maps for Seaworld, Universal Studios, etc. so you<br>  should probably look on a map to see what you think you might like.|`|lKJT7NKuaa	You'll have a blast....if you're looking for a bunch of scary rides then I would recommend going to Six Flags in Vallejo or Valenica, CA.<br>  <br>  But if you're looking for just having a good time on the kiddie rides than I would go to Disneyland. Of course there is California Adventures which is adjacent to Disneyland and has rides for people more your age.<br>  No doubt you'll have a good time no matter what you choose though.<br>  =)

cg3IaThxaa	1st you need The Sims 2. When I got it it was $40, but I'm sure it's less expensive now. I get all my games at Target, Best Buy is like $10 more for each game. <br>  <br>  There is also a Sims 2 Holiday version for $40, it's the same game, you just get lots of Christmas stuff as a free bonus, I wish I would have gotten that. <br>  <br>  So you need to get 1 of those, and then you can add on expansion packs & stuff packs.<br>  <br>  Stories are a type of expanision pack, I have The Castaways and Life Stories, (The only other one I know of is Pet Stories.) I don't really play those, they're kinda boring to me. (The Castaways one SUCKED! Don't get it.) BE CAREFUL, you need a DVD player to play the Stories games!!<br>  <br>  Expanision Packs:<br>  Ok, this is what you add on to your Sims 2 game. Here are the ones I have:<br>  - Nightlife. (If you could only get 1 expanision pack, I'd say get this one, or apartment life, the cars & places are awsome. Plus you can be a vampire, or witch if you choose apartment life.)<br>  - Apartment Life<br>  - Pets<br>  - Seasons<br>  - Bon Voyage<br>  - Open For Buisness<br>  - University (Really, really boring.) <br>  The only one I'm missing is Free Time, but it looks lame. I like them in that order. <br>  <br>  Stuff Packs:<br>  I only have Celebration!, H&M Fashion, &Teen Style Stuff. <br>  - Holiday Party Pack <br>  - Family Fun Stuff <br>  - Glamour Life Stuff (I want it bad.)<br>  - Happy Holiday Stuff <br>  - Celebration! Stuff <br>  - H&M Fashion Stuff <br>  - Teen Style Stuff <br>  - Kitchen & Bath Interior Design Stuff (I want it.)<br>  - IKEA Home Stuff (Want it.)<br>  - Mansion & Garden Stuff (Really want it. <br>  <br>  It just depends on your personal taste and what you like. I think you should probably save your money though, and get Sims 3 which comes out in June and will be like $60 or so for everything. It's gonna be so much better than Sims 2.|`|AONZRa16aa	<a href="http://quiver.outwar.com/page/5736" rel="nofollow">http://quiver.outwar.com/page/5736</a>
qAiNHpUzaa	Play Key Quest.
CwpCyFzvaa	The best ride is definitely Spash Mountain, then comes Space Mountain. In splash mountain you will get soaked all over with water and with space mountain you are riding a roller coaster in somewhat darkness and you don't know what is going on. Another great ride would have to be STICH, it is a ride where you sit down. (Not going to tell you what happens, that's for you to find out.) If you decide that you need a brake head over to Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, this ride shows how times have changed in over the years. I almost forget that another good roller coaster is Big Thunder Mountain. It is pretty fast  and loads of fun.<br>  Make sure you get your fast-passes before you get on line so that you get on quicker.<br>  If you don't know what a fast-pass is, it is a station where you go and put in your park ticket and it gives you a ticket to use about an hour later, so that you can get on a ride faster. Fast-pass station are only open for a certain time and then close after all have been taken for the day.<br>  If you plan on staying the whole day at night they have an awesome parade and fireworks show right over cinderella's  castle.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|AA12225622	I love Mission Space and Soarin, both at Epcot.|`|sxJl0mthaa	I would have to say the Tower of Terror or Rockin' Rollercoaster starring Aerosmith.<br>  The tower is amazing and the ride changes everytime you go on it so it doesn't get boring.<br>  I went on Aerosmith for the first time in July as I don't like rollercoasters and the second it launched, I apparently started screaming about how amazing it was and was singing to the music.<br>  I would probably have to say Aerosmith was my absolute favourite!|`|K4bJgTF4aa	space mountain or splash mountain|`|U3bzLVhKaa	Tower of Terror...Rock'n Roller coaster...Space Mountain|`|5E4qSejXaa	space mountain by FAR

AA10595247	You need a game mod in order to get pregnant teens. There are two mods available.

oHOBStehaa	If you set this card face-down, then this card, when it battles, wouldn't be destroyed by battle because it would flip face up first and damage calculation would occur. If it flips face up, it does not count as a Flip Summon when your opponent attacks it. If it is Summoned, then its effect activates, because Flip Summon is a Summon (w00t?!).<br>  Also, reading the rules might help you understand other stuff.|`|RrWMfUj8aa	You may lay it in face down Defense Position, but after you switch it face up you can not change back to defense. When it is attacked it is considered summoned, but i do not think it is considered flip summoned(but i could bo wrong). And yes if it is attacked while in face down defense it will not be destroyed as a result of battle. Yes you must flip the coin when it is summoned.

Choose 1 of your favorites...or have all three!<br>  <br>  On to the "3 Ringed Circus"  If you have the ability to create a huge ring (money, room & space), kudos to you. If not. Make a picture.

I play both, but to be honest, I throw more ￥100 coins into the Namco machine than its Capcom cousin.<br>  <br>  Tk6 is a much more in-depth fighting game than SF4 and if you're willing to put in the time and effort to train your skills, you won't be disappointed with its replayability and the unparalleled roster of characters.<br>  <br>  Anyway~ just my thoughts! Happy gaming!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and answering questions for you, and sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks".

oHOBStehaa	For your monsters:<br>  Wait, what? Dark Crusader??? Dude, his effect doesn't work because it "sends" cards to the Graveyard. Dark World monsters' effect activates when they are "discarded" by a card effect. So, I suggest you don't include this card. Sillva and Goldd should both be at 3 because they are your main beatsticks. I suggest toning down Beiige because of Sillva and Goldd; they all have the same effects but Beiige is weaker. You should have 2-3 Browws to have more draws. Gren and Kahkki aren't that special so I suggest keeping them at 1 or 2. Put a Reign-Beaux in there because I'll explain how he's a powerhouse later. Caius is fine. Maybe a Gorz to add aggression.<br>  <br>  For your spells:<br>  Dark World Dealings is one of the main cards in a Dark World deck; it enables you to mill your deck, and when Broww is discarded, it thins the deck even more! You should have 3 of these. Dark World Lightning is good and having 2 is okay; side deck 1 perhaps. A Feather of the Phoenix? Really, you shouldn't use it because the discard factor doesn't activate a Dark World monster effect; the discard is a cost, not a card effect. Also, do not use Enemy Controller; use better spell cards like Card Destruction, Giant Trunade, Card of Safe Return, Heavy Storm, and, I don't know, Allure of Darkness. Try The Cheerful Coffin. Gateway to Dark World is a must, really. It is a Quick-Play Spell Card; use it during your opponent's turn to bypass the side-effect! Reign-Beaux revived with this would turn the tables because a 2500 beatstick will kill a lot of monsters. Dark World main cards, Sillva and Goldd, have 2300 ATK; monarchs would easily destroy them. Use cards like Shrink, Burden of the Mighty, and the field card, Mystic Plasma Zone.<br>  <br>  For your traps:<br>  If your using Reckless Greed, use 3. Last time I checked, its not semi-limited. Fine is fine... But, use 1 because it would destroy your hand quickly. Magic Jammer is not good; use Solemn Judgment or Dark Bribe or maybe Magic Drain. Replace Sakuretsu Armor with Magic Cylinder and Mirror Force. The Forces of Darkness, keep it at 2, and maybe side-deck 1. Use Dark Deal to annoy your opponent and maybe discard Reign-Beaux! Also, use Torrential Tribute, man. <br>  <br>  Ah well, this is my analysis. Try using Tuners and Synchro. Note that Dark World decks destroy the hand, so try to limit your discarding.

If not, get a 360.|`|MkoivzxUaa	It really depends on what you prefer PS3 has blu ray already built in and has a few games you might like that are exclusive like killzone 2 and god of war 3 but xbox 360 has more variety of games in my opinion like gear of war 2 and halo3  and they are good multiplayer games in other words i would choose xbox 360|`|8HunHw3Uaa	XBOX 360<br>  <br>  1.Graphics<br>  2.Games<br>  3.Online capabilities<br>  4.Playability<br>  5.Features<br>  6.

Xbox LIVE, the online service, is the most solid online-community I have ever seen. And it is always monitored for performance, so multiplayer matches barely get lag. The Xbox 360 console its self is a proven machine. The controller is (alot!) better than the PS3, the game titles for the Xbox 360 are even more solid, and overall, it a kick-@$$ experience.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has some real magnificent hardware specs (it's really a super-computer compared to the Xbox,) but Sony barely gives any tools to developers, so the games don't show the PS3's power. Plus, the Playstation Network is free, but it is absolutely terrible compared to Xbox LIVE.<br>  <br>  And with the new improvements to the Xbox 360s internal hardware, the console will last longer and run perfect.|`|d9j0pkSJaa	360 they have a much better gaming experiance[game selection] more realistic graphics beter online play and with all the skins u can get its a lot better looking compared to the ps3 which only comes in white silver and black<br>  id go with the 360|`|tnyYGsh1aa	PS3 has better Graphics(1080p)<br>  Xbox 360 has only720p but it has better games like Gears of war halo.....|`|Mn9uHb6oaa	Xbox is better for me.

AA12042448	Are you trying to download this to iron-on photo paper?  Your question is very vague.  Can you find what you want through Google Images?  Be sure to look for designs that are not copyrighted, of course.  You could search for things like coloring pages with a St Patrick's Day theme.  Most of those are deliberately not copyrighted and are available for free use.   Print them to your iron-on paper (if that's what you're using) put them onto your shirt, and then paint the shirt with the soft fabric paints that crafts supplies stores now carry.  Or use fabric crayons on it.  Those are fun, too.|`|OK9SqlPbaa	Well if you mean like if they would print your design on the shirt its not free, if you mean just draw something then use ms paint, its free and easy to use

F4gVAPlGaa	If you run badly enough, this will run into a problem at most casinos.  The table's maximum bet.  At the casinos I have played in, its usually $500 for an even money bet, $50 for a single number bet.  Although, you'd have to run pretty badly with the system you describe.  If you did what you describe all the way up to the table max of $50...you will win something:<br>  <br>  1 - (37/38)^500 = 0.99999838168252 = 99.9998% of the time<br>  <br>  But a small small part of the time you'll lose:  $12,750<br>  <br>  Also this creates another problem:  this doesnt work because if you would get to the $50 bets...a single win wouldnt put you out of the hole.  $50 x 35 = $1750.<br>  <br>  So....we cant go all the way up to $50 in 1 dollar increments 10 x each<br>  <br>  We can only go up to $6 before the 10x method would make us fall behind on successful hit ($210 = 35 x 6)<br>  <br>  so you only have 60 spins to successfully hit a number and guarantee a profit with a single winning spin:<br>  <br>  And you will accomplish this a respectable:<br>  <br>  1 - (37/38)^60 = 79.81% of the time...<br>  <br>  but 20.19% of the time you will be out $210...and although I wont show it because its a bigger pain in the butt...the 79.81% of the time you do win, your average win will not be $52.50 or more  (which is what you would need to roughly break even here)<br>  <br>  Long story short...THIS WON'T WORK.<br>  <br>  Edit:  reading your post again...I see that I think you were going to double every ten spins, not just increment by a dollar like I did this math on.  However, you will still have the problem of...occasionally hitting the table maximum when you are running really badly.  If you would double the bet every ten spins on a $50 table maximum for a single number...you only have 60 spins to hit a number.<br>  <br>  The only way this system "works" is if a person has an infinite bankroll and has a casino willing to take any size wager...neither of which exists in real life.|`|XBTyopIMaa	No, it wouldn't break any roulette rules.<br>  <br>  If you wish to play this at a LIVE casino, don't bother driving or flying there yourself.

WzKrZoHQaa	It is not all it is cracked up to be.  Why do I know this - well my father won a large amount about 9 yrs ago not the big one big a very nice amount, and he lost his (second) wife just 1 wk later to a heart attack, he was plagued with begging letters from all over with some very heart rendering stories and his house was burgled.  He had women offering all kinds but he wasn't interested.  He lost friends and got "new" ones or would be hangers on as he'd call them.  People changed towards him yet my dad was very down to earth and still went round the old people's homes playing his Yamaha keyboard to entertain them, every night he'd do this - but then several wanted him to do the job for nothing etc making comments like "well Len do we insult you by giving you this poultry amount" and he found that it was others that changed towards him and made him feel awkward about it not the other way round.  Dad helped some of the letter writers but not directly.  He would request more info and proof and if he felt it was genuine would pay a supplier direct or get me to make arrangements and send tickets to people or pay invoices for a child's private operation if it was something thathad to be done outside Uk in some circumstances.  He said he wished he'd never won  it.  It still caused probs when he died.<br>  <br>  I'd tell no one and then go away for 3 months to a remote island and take time for it to sink in and decide how I'd like the money to work.  I would not touch it by buying boats, jewellery, private jets etc.  I'd have ￡100K for the 3 -6 months of luxury first.  But I'd have to keep my partnet away from it as he would have the lot spent in a year - no joke he would be a complete nightmare, so it would force me to nake drastic relationship decisions too - it is not all it's cracked up to be.  Security for my children would be the first thing - otherwise you run the risk of kidnap for a ransom etc.  It will not bring you the peace of mind you think !!!!!.................|`|dtXzOGoKaa	i all was thought i would just buy a new car nothing flashy and just buy the house im in, but who knows money can change people i just hope im not one of them x|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	of course i would love to win,and yes it would change me. i would have to buy a business to involve myself in on a part time basis. i think it would be too easy to become lazy and perhaps alcoholic. yes, enjoy the money and yes live it up for a few months, but after the honeymoon period you would need a reality check and think of the future of your family. invest wisely and make your kids value the experience of working to live.|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	depending on how much, for example if it was the Euro Millions, I would study for the next five years, and then I would probably work, just to get out of the house..|`|xVMQx7dtaa	I probably would still work but a lot less than i do at the moment!

fEUhI86Aaa	Well first of all, if you want to make doubling your money fun, you're going to need to realize two things:<br>  1) The faster you want your gold earning rate to be, the more work you're going to have to put into raising your skills. <br>  2) Earning gold in groups is a lot more fun than earning it individually because you can work an chat at the same time. <br>  <br>  Picking raw materials is going to be relatively boring and there's going to be relatively low profit margins depending on the ease of access to pick up the elements. The best plan is to find a profitable spawn (red-spider's eggs, blue dragon scales....) in a hard-to-reach place. Not necessarily fun but it gives a faster profit so that you can move onto better things. <br>  <br>  The best way to have fun is to find a skill that you want to train and find a way to make it profitable. The problem with doing things like picking flax and burning seaweed is that all your labor doesn't open up any new options. It gives you gold, but no way to earn gold faster. <br>  <br>  For example, I craft law runes. It's profitable and I'm gaining experience to be able to make all of my own runes one day. It's also relatively fast to make a lot of gold. <br>  <br>  The funnest way to train and make money is through combat, but it takes a while to train up combat-related skills enough to make a profit. When you do get there though, it pays off really quick because you can kill monsters with friends and get a whole lot of cash. I can't really tell you what monster to kill though because it depends on your stats.|`|rlCgZXQ4aa	the best way is scamming!!!!! ok i remember one from my good ol runescape days.....this probly is the oldest trick in the book but it will work on n00bs!! ok create one nooby account buying something really cheap like a bucket (maybe not THAT cheap but cheap!) for like 10k or something high amount of money. pm some noob about it.(be far awya from the noob as possible) then get ur original another account selling the item ur nooby account is buying for like 5k. (try to get the noob to buy it like get on his world and get by him or something) then if hes dumb enough he'll buy the really cheap item for 5k and think hes gonna sell it to u for 10k but just log out from the nooby account and there u have ur 5k for some lame cheap item lol!|`|ApqQj4H1aa	I'm assuming you mean whats the fastest, funnest way to make money in runescape? Well, I used to play this game a lot and I've found a bunch of different ways to make money. I'm not really sure on prices anymore because I haven't played but here's a few tips. Buying something at a low price and reselling it is always a great way to make cash. Lets say you buy 1k iron ore for 60 gold a piece you can just turn around and resell that iron ore for 100 gold a piece, there will always be someone that wants to get materials fast for something and if you find that person they'll pay top dollar and you just made a quick profit. That method really goes for anything that you can buy, check for people that are doing bank sales or whatnot, usually they just want to get rid of the stuff and you can buy it for cheaper than average. An old way of making a lot of money fast used to be PKing or (Player Killing) in the wilderness, although i heard jagex ruined that somehow. Killing monsters is always fun and if you kill the right monster for something it drops thats in high demand you can make a ton of cash. When the barrows mini-game first came out people were going crazy over barrows gear buying it for millions, me and my friend made a lot of money doing that mini game getting the equipment. Blacksmithing is always good. Steel bars will probably always be in demand. Buy 1000 iron and 2000 coal for 300k or so, smelt them into 1000 steel bars and sell the steel bars for 600k or so, once again i dont really know the prices that much so i cant really help on that. One last thing level up your fishing people said it was boring but i always kinda liked it, great money making tool too, selling sharks and whatnot. Hope i helped =).|`|jGXK0sv3aa	hmm. I would suggest doing pest control. You get points (you can buy coal and stuff) you train, and it's fun!|`|4uZbZD0yaa	selling food,trading.

43zXRpLYaa	The tickets are good for one year only. I get some of those every year.<br>  You can go to Disneyland AND California Adventure for one day only.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	You have until 2/21/2010 to use this ticket.  What you have is for 1 day, but it is a hopper, meaning you can go back and forth between Disneyland and California Adventure.  Or you can stay in just one, whatever you want to do.  But it is just for 1 day, not for a year.|`|QtIpuKM3aa	you can use that ticket for one day and go to any park in the Disnyland area like universal, mgm, and use that same ticket and you can use it only once it probably has a bar code on it so it will be flagged and then after that day you can no longer use it. I would go to a travel agent that could help you out more than I could.|`|JYKEnbyFaa	Oh, We had connections, too. Got like tons of tickets also. <br>  <br>  Well, what it really means is that, a year later, in 2010, the ticket won't be usable. It won't get you into Disneyland. A hopper ticket is basically where you have access to the parks. Some areas don't apply, however.<br>  <br>  If you go, have a good time. =)|`|bjDkTIP2aa	That means you can go to all the diffrent parks in one year. These usually are costly. I am into helping you.

There is a small piece of cotton then the rest under there should be a extra flint. take it out for now and fill the main part with fluid put the flint back in and add some to the small piece. You should be ready to go. The problem I always had I put to much in then put it in my pocket and burned the heck out of my leg from the fluid. I carried one all through Nahm. If you ever have problems with the hinge or other things send it back and they will fix it for free. The case on mine was bad but it had my unit on it and they still replace the case and put the unit on it and it looked like new.|`|154dzJ1Faa	ha-ha ... what an odd question!!

AA12042448	You want a polymer adhesive -- matte or gloss, your choice.  You can get them at the crafts supplies store.  Use two or three layers of cardboard, and laminate them together with this adhesive.  Put more on the top and bottom layers, too.  This kind of helmet will not protect your head in a crash or fall, of course, but will be durable and will look cool.

61928f3e0fa270caadc72b70d037100baa	Les règles du poker<br>  Il y a plusieurs variations des règles du jeu de cartes poker.<br>  Je vais décrire les règles et comment jouer au straight poker.<br>  <br>  - Il peut y avoir, habituellement, jusqu'a 5 joueurs. Ils mettent la mise de départ.<br>  <br>  - Les joueurs tirent au sort pour le brasseur. Si la partie de cartes était déjà débutée, c'est le joueur à gauche du dernier brasseur qui donne.<br>  <br>  - Il brasse, fait couper le joueur à sa droite et donne 5 cartes à chaque joueurs. Vous devez faire la meilleure main possible à partir de ces cinq cartes.<br>  <br>  - Une nouvelle mise est faite pour cette première main. Si un joueur augmente la mise les autres doivent suivre ou abandonner la main.<br>  Quand tous les joueurs ont fini la mise, c'est l'échange de cartes.<br>  <br>  -Le joueur à la gauche du brasseur jette les cartes qu'il veut échanger, puis celui à sa gauche ... Vous pouvez jeter les cartes que vous jugez inutiles, pour en avoir des nouvelles, une seule fois.<br>  <br>  - Après avoir jeté, vous obtenez vos cartes de remplacement et votre jeu est maintenant final.<br>  <br>  - Une nouvelle mise est faite pour cette deuxième main. Si un joueur augmente la mise, les autres doivent suivre ou abandonner la main.<br>  <br>  - Quand la dernière mise est terminée, c'est le temps de montrer les jeux.<br>  Comme toutes les autres étapes, c'est celui à la gauche du brasseur qui commence.<br>  <br>  -Ceux qui quittent la mise, et donc la partie, ne montrent pas leurs jeux.<br>  Si tout les joueurs abandonnent sauf un, celui-ci n'est pas tenu de montrer<br>  sa main.<br>  <br>  - Quand deux joueurs on un jeu similaire, une paire de roi chacun par exemple, celui qui as la carte la plus haute emporte la partie.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|AA11193693	pas de règles , sauf une si tu trouves pas le pigeon au bout d'un quart d'heure ;c'est toi , pars en courant !! =)|`|02a378bd0805df7a56b063b0c6143fc7aa	Alors ?a, c'est une super question car je n'ai jamais su y jouer, et j'aimerai beaucoup savoir !!!<br>  <br>  Pareil pour la quinch, je ne sais pas y jouer pourtant tous mes amis savent mais personne ne prend le temps de m'apprendre...|`|4b230db536af2d2c8d5cb405a2ea9b6aaa	Va sur un site de poker en ligne, tu trouveras les regles : <br>  <br>  - www.partypoker.com<br>  - www.pokerroom.com<br>  <br>  Il y en a sans doute d'autres mais moi je joue là.|`|76b86714b0a9dc891ff2cb329d152ecbaa	Il existe plusieurs variantes du poker.

kgKUV95Oaa	Okay, since you were asking what the best rides are and not what the rides are I'll let you know. I work at Universal lol but I'm not biased. At Universal, we have a new roller coaster opening up hopefully in March so that might be something to try. I'll let you know after employee preview night lol. The revenge of the mummy is good if you like indoor, dark roller coasters. Jimmy Neutron and the Simpsons are both simulators and jerk you around. Shrek 4-D isn't bad if you're into 3D and like shows, same goes for Terminator. Jaws isn't worth the time if there is a wait. Men in Black is tons of fun. ET is old and isn't worth the wait, but is a relaxing ride. <br>  <br>  At IOA, the hulk is definitely a great thing to hit. Storm force is just like the tea cups at Disney so you aren't missing much. There is never a wait really to get on so if you like that, go for it. Doom isn't worth the wait, but it is fun to do when you don't have to wait. Spiderman is getting jerky as it gets older, but is a fun ride. Dudley Do Right is something you can't miss but it might be dry in April. Same goes for Bluto's. Jurassic Park is fine. Dueling Dragons will be closed for refurbishment. The sky trolley is more for kids, as is one fish two fish red fish blue fish and the carosuessel. The cat in the hat is a fun ride though.<br>  <br>  If you need to know anything else, let me know!|`|z0wx4sDkaa	Universal Studios:<br>  Family: E.T Adventure<br>  Kids: Woody Woodpecker Nuthouse Coaster<br>  Thrill: Revenge of Mummy <br>  Dad's Favorite: Men in Black:Alien Attack<br>  Mom's Favorite: Shrek 4-D<br>  Water Ride:Jaws<br>  <br>  Islands of Adventure:<br>  Family: Spider man<br>  Kids: Spider man(Again)<br>  Thrill: Incredible Hulk,Dueling Dragons<br>  Dad's Favorite: None<br>  Mom's Favorite: None<br>  Water Rides: Popeye, Ripsaw Falls<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|sxJl0mthaa	This is just my personal opinion and doesnt include shows:<br>  Universal Studios:<br>  1, Revenge of the Mummy Ride (my 2nd fave ride EVER)<br>  2, The Simpsons Ride<br>  3, Men In Black: Alien Attack<br>  4, Jaws<br>  5, Twister: Ride it out<br>  6, T2-3D<br>  7, ET<br>  8, Shrek 4D<br>  <br>  Islands of Adventure<br>  1, Jurassic Park River Adventure<br>  2, Spiderman<br>  3, Dudley Do- Rights Rip-Saw Falls<br>  4,Popeye & Blutos Bilge Rat Barges<br>  <br>  I cannot comment on the following, but I know that they are great as many people have told me.<br>  HULK<br>  Dueling Dragons<br>  <br>  Dr Doom's Fearfall is a little poor and Storm Force Accelerator is boring, but this is just my opinion.

( Roller-Coasters, water, etc.)<br>  The main water rides and thrill rides are in IOA. Universal Studios is based more in the family. (ex. E.T. Ride) But, in my opinion, the best rides are:<br>   JAWS, Men In Black, The Simpsons, Earthquake/Disaster. All of these are at Universal.<br>  <br>   At IOA: Popeye Rapid Ride.

QWHpXlNCaa	Disney Land? When people can go to either and where there is a Disneyland available they outgross the six flags nearby. Six Flags is more for 14-24year olds to where Disney attracts the little ones and mom and dad or maybe even the grandparents. They have rides for the young crowd too.<br>  Go here for your six flags or disney tickets . There are both located on the right side of the page.|`|VVF6DJVzaa	aight well u are 13 and disny land is started to become a bit childish for you now. <br>  <br>  SIx flags its a straight up place to ride coasters. So if ur into that stuff, its basically kingsdominion. But better. It probaby has some water resort with it. <br>  <br>  But disneyland is huge and it has rides. and u will probaby need to stay there for a while. I'd say go to disneyland its more fun, has a lot more for entertainment. But its gonna be crowded as always.|`|c4f3a255325dc603efdbbc2d4be0d01eaa	Six Flags is a lot cheaper, but the fun kind of depends on which one you're going to.<br>  I think Disney World is a lot better than Disneyland. But I would take Six Flags over them any day, as long as it was the one in Illinois.<br>  I don't know about the other ones, but this one has a lot of good rides, and has a water park too. I go every year and never get sick of it. Plus the lines aren't TOO long. Disney usually has the shortest line wait at like an hour. I guess it all depends on when you go though.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is, if you've never been to a Disney park before, this would be a better opportunity than later on in your life would be. You're young enough to not think it's TOTALLY lame, and also probably tall enough to go on all the rides. You could always go to Six Flags some other time, cause it's good for pretty much every age group.<br>  <br>  Plus, I'm not sure Six Flags is even open at that time? Not positive, but I don't think it is.|`|q791er1naa	6 Flags will be more fun...At least I think, I tried to go to the one in Valencia, CA and sat in the july sun for 4 hours in line before someone came out and told us the computers were broken and we wouldnt be able to get in, it was also some type of Mexican Holiday and there were literally thousands of people waiting in line to get into this place...HELLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XR3SPPCVaa	Six Flags has a lot more rides. Disney Land is awesome but it's childish, which you are only 13 so I think you'd like it. I'd go to Disney Land first and try Six flags next year when you get a little older. You might not even be tall enough to ride some of the rides at Six Flags. Have a great birthday! Happy birthday to you!!|`|40zewEkMaa	six flags, b/c it's just up the street.  are you sure that it's not disney world you're talking about.  because disney world is wayyyy better!|`|G3Dj9pdpaa	You are going to get a LOT of different opinions on this. I like both parks about the same, but here's what the deal is:<br>  Six Flags Magic Mountain (I'm assuming you're talking about Magic Mountain here, since there are other Six Flags parks) still has a focus on thrill rides. They have over fifteen intense roller coaster. Disneyland has incredible theming and a lot of fun rides. Your decision is entirely up to you. But Six Flags is a lot cheaper, so if you're torn, go with that. However, Disneyland does have to 2fer offer for Southern California residents, so if you live in Southern California, you may have to check that out and see about getting two days for the price of one. <br>  Basically, Six Flags has crazy rides, and Disney has crazy theming. Go with your gut.|`|cCAGstnpaa	You shouldn't do that! Disneyland is so boring! If you love scary riees, go to Six Flags Magic Mountain. It is the best amusement park ever!!!!! If you don't want to ride rides all day that is not a problem. Magic Mountain has lots of games to play. Have lots of fun!!!!!!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Six Flags is better. Disney land is a cheap, advertising-paradise and the lines are horrible. Its dirty and not the worth the money. Six flags will be better for your age!<br>  Hope that helps :)|`|3ourvbHoaa	Disneyland beats anything|`|aDSuIzuoaa	DISNEYLAND!!!!!|`|z0wx4sDkaa	if u love scary rides then you'll love six flags :)|`|NAhEQiXyaa	Six Flags, less lines|`|h6cAhPs6aa	DISNEY,  I GO A LOT|`|fXOKEin7aa	If anyone says 6 flags or disney has less lines then the other it is totally not true...i have been to both the same amount of times and the lines are the same, its just really expensive to buy fass passes in 6 flags and you can only use it a limited amount of times. Its an amusment park and u will have fun no matter where you go. Dont let your brother tell you where to go, its your birthday. Listen to yourself and what you want to do.|`|JYKEnbyFaa	Disneyland? Not DisneyWorld, right. Well, Disneyland, is more kiddish, if you know what I mean. Six Flags has pretty good rides. <br>  <br>  Please, if you mean the DisneyWorld in Florida, go there. Some rides are so scary and it's so awesome.|`|LbgTvsv3aa	im 13 to but i hate the rides at six flags there to extreme for me i think you should go to disney land once in your life time i would rather go to disney land its a family place not that many cool rides but still i think better then 6 flags|`|4Ijc5NIJaa	Six Flags! The rides are so much better! If you want a thrill, go to Six Flags.

I think I found it, was it the graphic under the "WATCH" billboard looking thing that had the TV schedules? If it was a real functioning drum (like one that you could play, or could have played at some point) then you could probably make one out of plywood and an old bass drum. I'd rather make one because you can choose the colors and stuff.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi - Try these tips:<br>  <br>  5 Quick Polymer Clay Sculpting Tips <br>  <br>  1: Keep a wet washcloth or wet wipes (baby wipes) on hand to keep you hands clean while sculpting. Any little piece of dirt of pet hair your hands pick up will stick to your sculpt.<br>  <br>  2: Smooth out your polymer clay using isopropyl alcohol. 90% will smooth more aggressively than 70%. I keep both on hand to use depending on what I need.

Then I learned that if I included "tutorial" in the search terms, I could find step-by-step pictures of how to cut them out and sew them up.

LCIaikPlaa	Use 3/4 inch thick chipboard for the table and support it with horizontal timbers on the walls and vertical ones screwed into the side of the floor joists. Make sure that you use enough rawlplugs and screws for the horizontal timbers to support the weight of the top. Screw the top onto the horizontal supports. Do not nail them as this could weaken the supports. A size of support around 3/4 by 2 inches (rough sawn) should be ideal. When using supports underneath the table, make sure that you countersink the screws to ensure that the top remains flat.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	use paper hanging paste tables|`|Unk4zu2Naa	ha ha omg model trains isn't that for like kindergarteners!?! lolz sry no disrespect <br>  :)<br>  p.s you could get the tracks glue them together. hang them up on the ceiling like in the movies or somethin|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	Home Depot and hardware stores sell brackets that hold two 2x4's to make inverted V-shaped supports.

fvre0o9laa	Tissue lame is nasty stuff to sew with... behaves better if you fuse it to interfacing before trying to sew it.  Depending on the actual structure of the fabric, I've had luck with microtex needles on most, but some have sewn best with jersey needles (ballpoint).|`|kYN8H5uPaa	When I have to work with lame I apply a thin iron on interfacing to back.

Hope this helps.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	you might try hand stitching with a slimmer rounded needle. Or you might try different needles on your machine with scrap fabric to find the best needle for your machine and or adjust the tension also according to the fabric you are using.  You might also try different threads.  good luck

cuR7T3praa	This is the first time I would suggest you looking at the publications in your local library.  This can save you a lot of money.  For the tests you need, they are now on line for you to learn.  Only thing you have to remember with it it that the way the questions are on the learning test are not the same as on the one you will take so don't put down an answer of a A  but be sure what you learned is the answer you give.  You can get some good buys by checking the swap shops they have on the "nets"  and also at the Ham fests.  Can't give you a quote but the cheapest way to  start would be with a handheld as if you plan to have the radio in the home you will not only have to purchase the radio you will also have to install an antenna and wiring is needed for that.  If your going to the swap shops or the Ham fest you will probably get something for about $100. to $150.  But if you want to go the other way check on the stores that are selling  or on the computer to check for prices.   n8odz|`|4qT0TfMZaa	If you're in the USA, go to www.arrl.org  That'll bring you to the home page of the American Radio Relay League - the official organization of ham radio in the US.

43zXRpLYaa	The best days are when it rains, there's no one there. Holidays are bad, when the weather is good is bad, weekends are bad. Normally Monday is just as bad as the weekend because everyone thinks that people go to back to work, but everyone thinks that and they go on Monday. The only time Mondays are good is when it's a four day weekend because people usually go out of town and are returning home that day. As soon as spring hits and the weather is nice and more people start to go. The summer is the peak season and ends in September. It dies down until December and people go around that time for the decorations. Then it dies down in January till spring break.<br>  <br>  If you can go during the middle of the week that would be better.<br>  <br>  I went at the end of January and the longest I waited in line was 10 minutes. I also went a few days ago and when it was raining and I practically walked right on the rides.

8pIGQdybaa	If you have the funds for cheap green plastic tablecloths (available at Party City or other party stores), use them on the tables with white paper or cardboard squares connected by white tape to represent a baseball diamond. In the center, use whatever baseball equipment you have available (helmets, hats, upturned gloves with a ball in them, cleats with one laid flat and the other resting with the heel on top, folded jerseys, catcher's mask, etc.). If the centerpieces seem sparse, add a few inexpensive or borrowed baseball cards here and there.

ttfuh5pKaa	Once your dye application is complete, put your finished shirt in a plastic bag with a zipper closure. Allow the shirt to sit for 4-6 hours; this helps the dye to set and makes for a bolder, brighter shirt. <br>  <br>  Once the appropriate time has elapsed, remove your shirt from the bag and place it in the sink. Run water over it to remove the excess dye until the water runs clear (or almost clear). <br>  <br>  After the shirt has been thoroughly rinsed, remove the rubber bands. If you are impatient, carefully use scissors to cut them off. <br>  <br>  Finally, wash your shirt in the washing machine. Make sure to wash it alone (or with similarly colored tie-dyed items). It is also a good idea to run an empty load or something non-critical (such as a load of rags or old play clothes) after you have washed your tie dyed shirt. <br>  <br>  Enjoy!

X6rFPI2laa	There is almost always a pattern for exactly what you want printed on the inside of the wrapper around "eyelash" yarn used for those scarves.  If you have that kind of yarn on hand and haven't thrown the wrapper away yet, take a look!<br>  <br>  In case you have lost the wrapper, though, all you do is make a scarf about 6 inches wide and of the length you want, and about 6 above the cast-on stitches you make the slit.  To make the slit, put half of your stitches on a holder, and knit the others about 3 inches.  Put those stitches on a holder, cut the yarn (leaving a tail to weave in later), and attach the yarn to the stitches on the first holder (again, leaving a tail to weave in later).  Knit those stitches to the same length as the first, and then close the slit by putting all of the stitches back on your needles and knitting as you did before you made the slit.  When your scarf is the length you want or when you are almost completely out of yarn, bind off all stitches.  And that is all there is to it!|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	lots of scarf patterns here<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.knittingpatterncentral.com/directory/scarves.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.knittingpatterncentral.com/di...</a>|`|AA11548618	A keyhole scarf?
