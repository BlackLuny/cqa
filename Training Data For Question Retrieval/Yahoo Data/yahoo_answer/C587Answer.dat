Best of luck.

I realize this may sound strange, however the compounds used to kill off semen are also used in eliminating sweat.  Generally spermicidal lube can eradicate sweat better than deodorant and it also lasts longer.  Furthermore, it is also better for your skin; often times deodorant can harm your skin and cause irritation on the skin.|`|J3TpMzHbaa	In the summer time I sometimes sweat bad, I use a product called Prespirex.

Yes, I know it sounds strange, but its a proven method. It works the same way it works to prevent wrinkles, by paralyzing the sweat glands so they can't pump sweat out under your arms. You'll still sweat a tiny bit, but you should see a drastic improvement, and the treatment usually lasts around 6-9 months.|`|Cn70dwABaa	A) Stick to the RDA intake of fluid.  B) Always go to the toilet- putting it off will lead to excretion through sweat.  C) Make sure you are not overdressed or too hot.  D) If all else fails use Antiperspirant instead of deodorant.    Though option D is though most simple I do not recommend it because most contain aluminium based sulphates, which are potentially carcinogenic (cancerous).     BTW which idiot is going to rub condoms under their arms, I have never heard something so ridiculous or ludicrous in my life. If they were a Chemistry major they would name the compound!|`|tNQIE29raa	remember man,people don't sweat they perspire.keep cool,that's it.
emafkz9baa	You consider yourself "emo"? Emo is someone who is "emotional", someone who cuts themselves because they have no other way of expressing how they feel. Emo is someone who gets upset occasionally but is not depressed. Have you tried to kill yourself with the "proper" effort? Have you really and truly taken a knife to your wrist and cut long ways? have you OD'd on pills? Have you tried drowning yourself? Have you sat in the garage with the car on in hopes that you'd suffocate from the carbon monoxide?    I'm not sure you've done any of these, considering you're still able to sit up on a computer and talk about your "problems". you may be upset about not having friends but that's just a status issue. "the more friends you have, the happier you'll be". That's bullshit. Don't get caught up in that.     You say you have a boyfriend, and for nine months?? People who are depressed can't last in a relationship. it seems impossible for them.     everyone feels alone sometimes and i imagine it must suck thinking that you have no friends but remember, you do have your dog. you do have a boyfriend, and you do have a future ahead of you. i know that sounds corny because ignorant adults say it all the time, but here, i am, a 17 year old, telling you the same. i am clinically depressed and i try everyday to hang in here. i don't want to die. i don't want it to end while i'm still young.

As you stated everyone is cheating you unfairly, but JESUS CHRIST will ALWAYS LOVE YOU and treat you the same.  When your friends or your boyfriend or even your dog turn their back on you JESUS CHRIST won't.  Millions of people go through the same thing that you are experiencing now including myself, but it is how they go about wanting to make a change that is the difference.  Instead of getting upset that people are making fun of you or not wanting to be around you, you should be blessed because you know already that they are not TRUE and not for YOU.  GOD will bring the right people into your when the time is right, but you have to be obedient and patient and faithful with him.  Try it!!! Ask him to forgive you for ALL your sins and to send you TRUE friends to surround yourself with.  The sky is the limit and HE will come through for you if you are serious about making a change.  Depression is what the enemy puts on us to make us think that we are not worthy of living and to take away our focus from God and doing and living right.  Today is the last day of your depression.  Get a hold of it and ask God to guide you in the right direction.  You will be fine I PROMISE and people will begin to flock to you because they are going to see something special about you that they may have not noticed before.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|rl11rrqVaa	That it self wan't help.  U must do some exercises too.

Iov5Z7O4aa	Well, Erica, the other answerers gave you great replies.  So if you wanna give one of them the point,s no harm done.      The event you described is one reason to always keep one of those 35 mm film canisters on you.  In it are 5 or 6 pain pills.     Now, I feel sorry for you, honest.  It was a brutal experience, and could have been handled better by a number of people, who let you down...    But think of this:  You have all your marbles.  That mother probably has most of hers left. (we hope...)  Imagine what it is like living with that kid 24/7.  Imagine being that kid's mom.  Worse, imagine being that kid...    You know, all in all, things are not so bad for you after all....    You have a doctor, some people don't.  This happened once in how many years?  What are the odds it will happen again?    This is also a good reason to pick up, in a dollar store, one of those little packets of foam rubber ear plugs. Peace, for a buck. Anywhere.  It's worth it.    Hang in there kid.     You're smart, alive, not handicapped, and coping.  Keith Ledger bought the farm.  I betcha he'd trade places with you!|`|eRuE2F1Saa	Having a sensitivity to high noises and bright light as well, I can relate.  I have also been on both sides of "the glass" so to speak, at the Dr's office. I do not know the set up of the office but I can  tell you that I was taught to make sure the front office was as comfortable as possible.  If you  need to go there again, I think I would ask if "girl and her mom" are going to be there as well and request my appointment around them or even on another day.  They get enough requests like that, they will get the idea. Sounds to me like both the mom and receptionist could have dealt with this much better but I know that does nothing really to serve rattled nerves.  I think you were correct in letting the dr. know about it.|`|slHUNl58aa	You did the right thing..Maybe she did consider other people.. you never know how bad the kid would have went off if her mom tried to keep her quiet at that age.

The child may not have been able to control her self and the mom maybe stressed out because of it but still in this case I have to agree with you and think you did right it's the mom that should of done things different.
CsIvy5MAaa	It'll probably be fine. If you have hydrogen peroxide laying around, you can make a mouthwash out of that (50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water) which is pretty effective.    Some people also use bleach to help clean up gingivitis (recommended by lots of dentist.) Just put a very tiny amount in water, swish it around your mouth, spit it out, then wash your mouth out with normal luke warm water.      Either way, one night shouldn't hurt.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Should be fine if it is just for one night. I use that stuff too. What I do is use a regular mouthwash after I use corsodyl.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Your vagina will only smell bad if there is something wrong, a fish-like smell is a classic symptom of an infection called bacterial vaginosis - it's common, all women get this from time to time, but it does require treatment. Bacterial vaginosis is basically when the 'bad' bacteria take over from the 'good' bacteria within your vagina, because it is a bacterial infection it does need antibiotics - this isn't an infection you can treat yourself, but it's no big deal just a trip to your doctors and you'll either get a cream or tablets.     You need to keep yourself from getting other infections, I'm assuming as no one has told you what this is that no one has told you how to best care for your sexual health to avoid common infections such as these. A few things to watch out for;     Washing too often washes away fluids and 'good' bacteria vital to vagina's self-cleaning functions. Only wash with water, anything chemical such as soaps, wipes or bubble baths can interfere with vaginal pH and vaginal flora, soaps also can't tell the difference between 'good' and 'bad' bacteria. So-called 'feminine' cleaning products marketed specifically to play on women's insecurities can be just as harmful. Douching is particularly bad as it strips away vaginal fluids and pushes harmful bacteria up deeper. Make sure to dry after washing but as towels can harbor bacteria, try a hairdryer on a cool setting.     Although BV is not an STI it can be passed back and forth between partners just like any other infection, so if sexually active but not using condoms get your partner treated too. Semen can cause problems as it has different pH to your vagina so can push things over the edge if your vagina is already a little off balance, so it's best to avoid sex feasting as your vagina may not be able to adjust quickly enough. Some women also find specific partners can cause problems. Watch out for lubricants that contain nonoxynol-9 as this can cause serious problems for some women. Some women experience problems using hormonal birth control as the hormonal change in turn leads to changes in their vagina throwing everything into chaos.     There are the normal things too such as tight clothing and synthetics that prevent aeration to your groin making the area warm and moist, perfect for bacteria and yeast  this is also another reason to avoid liners. If you are sitting down all day at work then your groin may also be getting warm and sweaty, not to mention if you hot desk the seats will be full of bacteria from others, so get up and walk around occasionally. Check toilet habits making sure to wipe front to back and wipe your backside well to avoid bacteria getting onto your underwear  also try tea tree oil when washing to help kill any bacteria within your underwear.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	I dont know but mine smells like onions sometimes too.

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, first off, B-17 isn't actually a B Vitamin... that's more of an attempt to make it sound better. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin has a good article on it that lists under toxicity: "Beta-glucosidase, one of the enzymes that catalyzes the release of the cyanide from amygdalin, is present in human small intestine and in a variety of common foods. This leads to an unpredictable and potentially lethal toxicity when amygdalin or Laetrile is taken orally"  It's always best to do research into new treatments like this. Good luck!|`|cr8J3hPqaa	oh noo dont take B17, its toxic, take the pharmaceutical drugs.

396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	It's sad but many times very true.  I have a full AIDS diagnosis...and I was infected by a man who knew he was positive and never told me.  Don't think that I blame him for my infection...I was stupid to ever trust him...but I do blame him for the fact that I got my diagnosis while in the hospital fighting for my life.    My personal stance of this is that this is my disease and it stops here with me.  I think that we as hiv infected people should respect the fact that we are the only answer, at the moment, to stopping the spread of this disease.  I mean, Im not smart enough to find the cure so I do my part by not engaging in high risk behavior.  Its unfortunate that many of the people who are infected have issues with drugs, mental illness, and then of course you have your sociopaths who just don't care about anyone but themselves.  HIV rates are associated with people who have problems in their lives that put them at risk in the first place.  IV drug users have issues with addiction and will take their next fix how ever they can find it.  Mentally ill people are prone to be in high risk situations (partners who cheat, sex for money).  And low self esteem in people leaves them less likely to insist on using a condom.  It really is a vicious circle.|`|deJFYuHbaa	I live in Baltimore and yes it is very sad and frightening that we have a high HIV/AIDS rate. It makes me think that I need to move to another state to reduce my chances of contracting the disease. Considering the fact that Baltimore & D.C are both very small, it seems that everybody is capable of having the disease. Karma, since the guy gave you AIDS, can't you sue him for attempted murder? I know this won't really help your condition, but it's some kinda justice for what he's done to you
RMdIyIbFaa	If the Doctor wasn't worried about it, I wouldn't either.     Have you had a cold recently? How long have you had it? Wait and see if it goes away on it's own. If it's still there in a few months go to the specialist, but I seriously doubt it's cancerous.|`|VC7PyH53aa	Cancer would probably not show up in the blood work. They usually check for specific things.   If you're concerned have your doctor refer you to a ear, nose and throat specialist.   I highly doubt you have a cancer of the nose.   If you're in a cold climate that can play hell on your nose/sinuses.   Every winter I get a scab inside of my nose from the weather. It doesn't go away until it warms up.|`|I3wY7wD9aa	Cancer will show up in your blood work only if the appropriate tests are taken. It may be just a 'blind' pimple inside your nose or it could be something worse. She said she would give a referral to a specialist -so get the referral.

niZBsn9Qaa	its insane........seriously.........you will get sick, you're metabolism will shut down and you will hardly lose any weight and when you start eating again, you will gain back double what you lost. trust me, i made that mistake and know a lot of people too who have made that mistake. others here will tell you.    however if you want to lose weight quickly at a rate of about 20 pounds a month, do the atkins diet. Google it, it is very strict but it works, you just have to be careful not to cheat and also when you start eating "normally" again, incorporate the foods back slowly. It will work a lot better than what you are suggesting    good luck|`|AA12182074	You need more food than that otherwise your body will go into starvation mode and as soon as you return to eating normally you'll put on what you did lose, plus more.  Just eat right and exercise.  Never skip breakfast.  A good breakfast may be yogurt and a fruit, lunch Whole wheat bread sandwich with turkey and lettuce and LIGHT mayo with a veggie and fruit side, and for dinner grilled chicken, some veggies, and some fruit.  If you get hungry in between reach for anything that comes from the ground.  Also, exercise.  Start out walking and work up to jogging and trying other forms of cardio.|`|PIG9DzYVaa	You would hate yogurt for the rest of your life.

GdGwodM5aa	First of all you need to have more confidence. I can't tell you how to do that, but you need to focus on what you are good at and apply that to areas that aren't so great. But also accept you won't be good at everything.  As for working - in lessons it's ok to ignore your mates if you want to do well. Make the choice.  At home - just work for a short period of time and allow yourself treats when you get a certain amount done, like watching your favourite tv show or having a candy bar.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Obviously you are not too self-centered.    But you are lazy    Try a little less whining, and a little more work|`|qWTAbGSeaa	First of all u need to have confidence in yourself and then fix time for your studies and read the stuff repeatedly and try to remember them whenever you get time.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.    When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the  1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern.     If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.    You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.    You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - http://www.straightabs.com|`|scX6smKVaa	you need to do cardio exercises as well as sit ups etc to get good abs!! you also need to eat alot of protein to gain muscle rather than fat!!!      Even if you ares lim your body fat percentage can still be high.|`|AA12182074	Not eating would be the WORST thing you could do.  When you don't eat your body goes into starvation mode and starts using your muscles for energy, so you in essence lose what muscle you have.  Best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet and exercise.  Jogging is an excellent all-over cardio workout but it also builds abdominal strength.  Push-ups and sit-ups are good for the abs too.  You could also try Pilates.|`|c8cVUppmaa	The guy above me is right..  If tyou don't add cardio to your crunches, you'll never see those abs! Even if you are skinny!  And you need to make sure you're getting a suffient amount of proteins to build the muscle as well, so you're gonna have to eat to get them!!!!!
KnTrvQd6aa	Many gender specialists believe that there's no advantage to taking progesterone, because it's main effect is on the uterus. They cite studies that show no appreciable effect, but they fail to consider the distinction between progestin (which has been studied) and progesterone (which hasn't).    Many trans women believe that progesterone is  very useful, particularly in proper development of the breast tissue.  As long as your endo is happy with you taking it, go ahead.     Personally, I use micronised progesterone; it doesn't get broken down in the gut so readily, so you can manage with a smaller dose. 100mg/day is a good average dose.|`|65QqZBnjaa	I agree with Diane for the most part.  The problem I have is you say you've been on estrogen 10 years (You started at 16! Wow)!  I'm not sure if you're going to get any benefit from progesterone at this point.  The best time to take it would have been...... well 10 years ago when your breasts were first developing.  Anywho, anecdotally progesterone seems to help make the breasts fuller.    Progesterone can have side effects:    Increased libido    Elevated anxiety      Good Luck!      edit: I would suggest joining an on-line support forum to ask such questions.  This one is targetted at your age group:    http://www.TrueSelves.com
q9i5f0rXaa	That depends on your resting/basal metabolic rate.  You're probably actually undereating, though.  1200 calories isn't much for an active individual.|`|D8uGioFAaa	everyone is different-i would say that, at your weight, if you just sat on the couch all day long, you would probably burn about 1200.|`|4UQegWk0aa	You need to work out your basal metabolic rate which differs for everyone. It assumes you have no problems with your metabolic system like thyroid problems etc. Use this link, it will help you work it out.    http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...    I couldn't work it out for you as I don't know your age or gender.|`|nHy5xxuuaa	I think it would be about 700 calories if you were to lay in bed all day. I think you may be eating too little calories. Your body might be thinking you are starving so therefore holding on to any fat stores you have. You need to reduce your calorie intake gradually to actually lose weight. Your body will only give up the fat when it's still being fed. Good Luck.|`|RZ4l6s65aa	it would burn around 1300-1400 just by laying in bed  and i take it you do actally get up so w/o the hour of excersize burn around 1700-1800 Calories|`|cuSRcd8uaa	the average daily calorie intake is about 1940 calories for women and 2550 for a man,  you must burn 3500 more calories than you eat to loose 1 pound  the average person burns about 200 calories a day without exercise   but that will change based on exactly what you do|`|ydNj7YM6aa	Calories is a large topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three definitions: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a specific physical action uses up every sixty minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories. The one thing that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away 30 pounds, it clearly does work!|`|EIYwoOXSaa	you need to be eating more calories than that! At least 2000 without exercise - even if you are dieting! Work on transferring the fat in your body to muscle, by doing different toning exercises - eg. sit ups, squats, lunges. Good luck!

ODYrypwaaa	Interesting question.  I guess it really depends on what you are measuring.  IF you are going by penetration, then no.  You are either a Virgin or not.  However, I am lean towards the idea that if you are "with" someone and one of you "finishes" or have oral then you are walking a fine line. Then end result is the same you just got there a different way. How are you  different than the person who takes the next step.  If you want to stay a Virgin you have to be proactive about it.  You have to work at being a Virgin.  Don't put yourself is gray areas.  Decide now where is YOUR line is.|`|da9b10820ab3418773c06c2801187326aa	No - this is not possible.

4CSXLqMMaa	You have been taking Levaquin for 48 hours and unfortunately that is not enough time to see any difference.  You will have to wait at least 4 to 7 days to notice any change and even if it is at a high dosage it will take that long to get into the system.  Some people do not notice any results for 7 to 10 days.  Please give it a little more time but do not hesitate to go to the ER or call the doctor if your systems get worse.  I have taken Levaquin numerous of times for infections and it is a very good antibiotic.

0KaadzHzaa	Changes in appetite, and sleeping habits, as well as feelings of hopelessness, and helplessness are some of the major signs of clinical depression. You may want to talk to your doctor about it.|`|czhNL7xLaa	Yes you can get really sick by not eating, sleeping and crying alot. Been there done that but it really hurts your body. Your body needs rest so you need to sleep at least 7 hours and energy from eating cus you can develop certain body problems if you neglect your body from nutrician and crying alot all you get is puffy eyes. I will give you a hint, put a spoon in the freezer for about 10 minutes then put it over your eyes and then leave it on until the spoon is not cold anymore and then your eyes shouldn't be so puffy. Sorry to hear you are going through all of this, i have many times but let me tell you, you will feel better i promise. I know I know you hate when people tell you that cus i did too but it's true it does get better and easier. Stay strong.|`|da9b10820ab3418773c06c2801187326aa	Not eating means you have less energy available which means you will need to sleep more. If you do not sleep and eat then you can damage your body and your immune system weakens.     Healthy means being mentally, socially and physically well.
3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Some skin bridges are the remains of the infant synechial adhesions between the glans and the inner foreskin.  These should normally all break down during the first 5 or so years, but occasionally a boy's penis fails to develop quite as it should and so some synechia remain into teens or even adulthood.    There is also a normal 'bridge' on the underside of the penis called the frenulum.  This joins the back of the glans to the inner foreskin.  Its purpose is to assist the foreskin to return over the glans after an erection subsides, but it is not essential and can be safely removed if it is too tight or suffers frequent chaffing.    The third possibility for skin bridges, between the glans and the inner foreskin layer in other places around the penis, is that during healing of an infant circumcision, the cut edge of the circumcision was not kept separate from the glans by a coating of paraffin jelly (vaseline) and manual retraction of the foreskin remnant.  Parents should be advised to ensure that their little boy's circumcision wound cannot contact the glans so as to prevent the two fusing together to form a bridge.    Most bridges do not look particularly bad and may not even be noticed by women.  Unless very tight and prominent they will not affect sex.  If too prominent then they may become inflamed during sex.    A doctor can easily cut through and remove any of these bridges to both improve appearance and prevent any possible future problems.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	The skin bridge is probably the result of you being circumcised as an infant.  I can never condone circumcision in any case, but when it is done on an infant, the doctor cannot even see what damage he/she is doing.  When the infant is returned to the parents after this mutilating procedure, the notation is that there were no complications.  That is totally wrong.  The child is left to grow into an adult with unmatched skin, ugly scars, skin bridges, skin tags, a foreskin that is cut way too tight and causes pain during erections,...none of this shows up until the child becomes an adult, and is left to deal with this deformity.  You can go to your doctor and have the skin bridge removed, and if you so choose, you can start a process of foreskin restoration.  I can tell you it has made a huge difference for me.  See the links below for more information on foreskin restoration and if you have questions, or just need some moral support, write to me.  I am always happy to help restorers.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	No, its fine. Every penis has a skin bridge.

Good luck|`|2ce98f89b5fb6689e09d3b661af638c0aa	Well first I would suggest you just slow down. I understand you may have a lot of anxiety, especially with your family history. But that will not help you any to overreact to the problem. The obvious remark is to get some rest and go see your doctor. It's obvious because it is true. A chiropractor may also be of some use to you, but I would go see the doctor first to make sure it isn't some kind of internal problem.  Just a thought as well - I did have back pains when I was younger, but only because I was overusing my body. Now everything is fine (I am over 30).
rAQADfSvaa	This is called spotting and if it's unusual, you should always consult your doctor so they can take all the necessary precautions. Is there a chance you could be pregnant?     Edit: Without taking some tests, I can't tell you exactly why you're spotting, however stress can do all sorts of strange things to your body - including the starting and stopping of menstation at odd times. Are your especially stressed or anxious about something in your life? Another thing to consider is how new your cycle is. I mean, how long have you had your period now? If you're still within your first year, your body may still be in the adjusting stage. Hope some of this makes some sense to you. All the best! See your doctor.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Nothing Serious.

tI7Ovsq5aa	Try soaking in a hot bath and taking some pain killers. Back pains can be caused by many things such as heavy lifting, pulling a muscle during an activity like sports. At 15 I guess you are still at school? Maybe it's the amount of stuff you carry in your bag or the way you carry your bag to and from school. My son had many problems with his back due to this and it may have been a factor in his getting scoliosis. His bag was a hang of the shoulder.

AwpgkWSKaa	Because they aren't conditioned by routine.  There was an experiment where people were closed in a place without knowing what time it was and their body clock would get them to go to bed later and later eachtime but they still slept about 7 hours.  So in the end they had cycles where they slept at night, then during the day, then in between.  Drunks and drugees don't usually keep a steady life that requires them to get up by the alarm like all the rest of the conditioned world, and that's what happens to them.  I am one of them. I am not addicted to anything but I am not conditioned either as I have a job that doesn't require me to modify my body clock to the one from the outside world so I also have sleep patterns.  The bonus is that my days are about 26 hours long and so each week I gain about a day. ( I am a workaholic so that's good as I love my job, it is like a game)  Also' I get to see Dawn, Twilight, the moon, the Night and the Day and I get to see the poor $u (kers go to work in the morning (when I am in that cycle).  Priceless and one step closer to freedom.  Frank Zappa was like this, and many other artists and people who aren't framed by society.  So you could say it's a symptom of freedom, not of addiction.|`|2fc1TfiCaa	Because you can do whatever you want at night and no one cares!

I have a daughter who has been diagnosed with ADHD and she has had problems sleeping since she was very small.  I think there are several factors....her medication, her body clock and her ability to deal with daily stressors.  I believe that with some medications it is difficult to fall asleep.  When my daughter is unable to sleep she will stay up all night talking on the phone, playing on the computer and watching tv.  She often socializes with others on similar schedules.

Mxq1NQJdaa	There are receptor sites in the brain that are specific for certain drugs.  For instance, opiate receptors.  They can become desensitized and can eventually burn out completely.|`|XmdzKGAkaa	Your body no longer sees the drug as something new and just sees it as something normal so it doesn't effect you as much.|`|AA12031033	It probably depends on whether you've taken the drug for a long time, your body gets used to having it so it no longer works. Could also be from metabolism. If your metabolism is high, you burn the chemicals faster, so even though you are drug free, your tolerance may not go back to normal. That's a good question for your doctor. I also agree with Lacey.
aOmDuXubaa	Better than yoga for sciatica relief is Inversion Therapy.  Inversion therapy is the best treatment for back pain and sciatica that I know of.  In 04 I had to get back surgery for a herniated disc.  Nearly 2 years after surgery I STILL had painful and crippling sciatica, weak legs and pain.  A friend of mine turned me on to inversion therapy and I have been hanging upside down ever since.  what I've learned through treating with inversion therapy is that although we feel pain in  our backs, the pain really originates in the core, stomach or ab muscles.  As I inverted I felt my abs start to loosen as the spasms were stretched away.  As my abs relaxed they loosened their grip on my hip muscles, thighs and of course my back muscles.  Once these muscles were also relaxed my lower back and pelvis were free to go back into alignment and as they did my sciatica disappeared.  I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now because of inversion therapy and I want the world to know!  Inversion therapy has literally saved my life.  Do some research yourself and see if you think inversion therapy can help you as it did me.  GOOGLE: sciatica online health mart :and read about it.  there is also a link here below to tell you about yoga and other alternative methods of spinal treatment and why Inversion Therapy is superior to them all.

rAQADfSvaa	I'm sorry to hear you're going through this agony! The first thing I'd do is take 400mg of ibuprofen (advil) and then get a heating pad, such as a magic bag or hot water bottle and lay it across your abdomen. Try to eat something small, if only a banana or a yogurt - to protect your stomach from the effects of the medication. If this is normal for you (the harsh cramps), I'd consider letting your doctor know and also keeping track of when your period starts each month. I usually get a head start and pop some advil the day I'm expecting. Diarrhoea is very common while on your period. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Prevention is better than cure, menstrual cramps aren't something you have to just put up with, but there are literally millions of ways to approach the problem but too many to list here, certainly no room to explain why they work. Here are just a few simple common treatments;     Clary Sage.  An essential oil which naturally supports estrogen production and acts on the pituitary gland to help regulate menstrual problems. Used neat or diluted in vegetable oil you massage it into your abdomen. Better than painkillers as your body doesn't build up a tolerance which could make cramps progressively worse over time.     Cell Salts.  A natural mineral that your body needs for basic functioning so if lacking it can cause problems  when you get cramps take them every 5-10 minutes until the pain stops. Wikipedia explains cell salts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_salts     Heat.   Heat packs help increase blood flow to the pelvic organs, but cold packs may help too. If heat works for you then try a hot bath with a little lavender oil to help you relax and feel more comfortable.    Herbs.  Try in tea form from a store or supermarket, best fresh but teabags are fine just don't boil as this affects potency of the herb. If not a 'women's blend' try any of these; raspberry leaf, yarrow, lemon balm, black haw, chamomile, red raspberry, wild strawberry, Valerian. Bupleurum (aka xiao yao wan) is a Chinese herbal medicine you take 3-4 tablets 4 times per day for two weeks before your period is due, you can get this from any Chinese herbalist. There are plenty of other herbs to help, try talking to staff in a good herbal store as they will help you. Also try Evening Primrose Oil capsules daily, most health stores and supermarkets stock this as it is a good all-round women's health supplement that helps to regulate hormones. See Sister Zeus http://www.sisterzeus.com     Tampons.  These are to be avoided as they negatively affect vaginal health in turn affecting menstrual health, when they expand they can also add to bloating or expand into the cervix making cramps worse. Instead try to stick to pads, or if you use tampons switch to menstrual cups or softcups. See tampon health web site http://www.spotsite.org and menstrual cup support http://menstrualcups.org     Yoga.  Yoga is good as it has a lot of gentle stretching and breathing excercises, try the book 'Yoga for a health menstrual cycle' by Linda Sparrowe and Patricia Walden, DVD's or there are a lot of sites about yoga. Try this video with postures that would help you - http://www.videojug.com/film/yoga-postur...     Sex.  Masturbating to orgasm helps as during orgasm a hormone called oxytocin is released that causes uterine contractions, this along with relaxation and improved circulation help to ease cramps.    Stretching.  Anything that stretches the abdomen is good. Donkey exercise; kneel on all fours with your back parallel to the floor, hump your back up and then down again to the horizontal position. Salaam; kneel, slope your back, lean on your arms and rest your head on the floor, rest and relax in this position. Half-roll; lie on your back, hugging one knee, roll your body to the opposite side and back.     Acupressure.   A lot of women I know who suffer from extreme cramps go for complimentary treatments such as chiropractors or opt for acupressure or acupuncture. If you cannot afford to see a specialist get a book to teach yourself some basics of acupressure/acupuncture. Some points to stimulate for menstrual cramps are: BL24 (Qihaishu), BL25 (Dachangshu), BL30 (Baihuanshu), BL31 (Shangliao), BL32 (Ciliao), BL34 (Xialiao), CV2 (Qugu), CV6 (Qihai), KI5 (Shuiquan), and KI6 (Zhao Hai). You can find the locations of these points here - http://www.acuxo.com/selections.asp?ques...     Diet.  It can make serious differences but it's bloody complex so if it's something you'd be interested in you'd need to go research yourself. For now get a good balanced diet of nutritious foods rich in essential fatty acids and low in refined sugars, refined carbohydrates and hydrogenated fats. Avoid foods that make you bloated such as salty foods, when bloated drink more water with a little lemon juice as a natural diuretic. Some find dairy and caffeine cause problems  although coffee is good for reducing menstrual flow. Soy should also be avoided as it is notorious for causing problems.     Supplements.   Try taking a good multi-vitamin, omega 3 or flaxseed oil (approx. 500Mg 2-4 times a day), B vitamin complex with 100mg of vitamin B6, Magnesium (100mg every 2 hours during menstruation), and vitamin E in d-alpha tocopherol form (50mg 3 times a day). It sounds complex but for a start try a multi-vitamin daily and increase magnesium, calcium and potassium during your periods as these are needed by your body to help uterus lining shed.     Attitude.  It really does have a big influence, obviously good attitude means a|`|oZ3gU7htaa	Try aspirin and tylenol, a heating pad.  Sometimes exercise will relieve cramps if you can stand to start it.  Good luck.|`|YryC6dxUaa	Sounds to me like you kinda have a double whammy for pain there. Menstrual cramps and bowel cramps.

bTyTBRDwaa	It must be very difficult for you to love your boyfriend so much and have such intense jealous feelings.  It is wonderful however that you are able to recognize that it is a serious problem.      You disclosed that you have a history of physical and sexual abuse from past boyfriends.  If you haven't yet sought counseling to deal with your victimization, I would recommend you begin counseling now.  It is normal for victims of abuse to have issues with trust.  It is important for you to begin by taking small steps.  Seek out a counselor and begin to work on you.  If you don't, your jealousy will likely push your boyfriend away.  If you love yourself and love him don't allow for that to happen.      Best of luck to you!|`|XZlFLecLaa	its just a phase... i think that happens to most girls when they first start dating. you will grow out of it... just try to be aware and try to be calm and take other girls looking at your guy as a compiment... cuz he's with you ;) !!!!|`|5P3cHR4Taa	I think you are as well.|`|mmAjpMX1aa	Get some counseling...you can't maintain a decent relationship until you deal with your own issues first.|`|ySj7IeW0aa	Yes I also think you show psychotic signs and I think you should be put on a course of anty psychotics by your doctor.

I met a guy when I was 28 and what I still call today abuse was so intense that I started looking at woman, in the begining I could see that I was getting more and more sick untill I thought he did black magic on me.  But if I knew what I had known now back then (psychosis) then maybe I could have recieved help and proper medication to make me able to make the right decision on the relashionship.|`|u0o0bCw5aa	All us girls wonder if we're crazy sometimes. (Guys seem to think we are by default! Lol!) But seriously, what you're going through is an anxiety issue. You've been abused and you're afraid of loss and abandonment.     So long as the two of your are one-on-one you can be his sole source of affection and attention - you don't have to worry about being outdone or shown up. Other women provide a threatening distraction and although it's illogical to assume every girl he comes in contact with is a threat, the base cause and effect is there and you are over reacting too it.     Ask yourself how close you two really are... is there -really- any danger he'd dump you for the next pretty girl? Is he loyal? Do you trust him?     As for finding girls attractive; it's normal for us to check each other out; I'll look if I see a girl with awesome boobs or hair, although for me it's just a matter of "wow... she's so pretty!" and that's that. It doesn't have to be actual sexual attraction. If you feel like it really is, maybe you're bisexual? Regardless of what anyone else says, it's okay if you think it's okay - it's no one else's business.     All in all, I have very similar insecurities, due to similar abuse, but I'm dealing with them. I get nervous and awkward when people flirt with me, but I don't freak out anymore. You can get it under control too! :)     All you have to do to control illogical emotion is to stop and ask yourself how sound your insecurities really are, and make a resolution to listen too yourself and let it go. It's tough, but you'll feel great once you've done it!    Also... having a heart to heart with him to see how into you he really is would be helpful. If he's not committed to the relationship, your fears may be being triggered by subtle hints in his body language. If that's the case, you can try to fix it but if it's irreparable having it out in the open is more healthy then pretending otherwise.      If he likes you, but he doesn't know if you're "the one", of course he's going to be looking. You could try asking him not to shop around while he's out with you as a rule. If he likes you, he'll probably respect that.    After all, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you, right?|`|6tszxjTVaa	its good to be protective and means that you care about him. but he may find it kind of annoying.|`|y4RcWr9Caa	well i dont think your phychotic because physcos dont admit that they are because to them every one else is acting insane. your probelms are the result of whats happened to you, and i think it would help you to see a counsiller. some one like that would be able to help you better, and as far as your issue with your bf, as much as it might be painful to see him talk to other girls you just need to grin and bear it, and it wont be easy. what might help is when you see him do that you should talk to friends or occupy yourself in some way to take your mind off it. thats just what i think but good luck, i hope you find peace|`|1INN3zyHaa	go see a talk therapist, they can really help you get to the root of these issues and help you change your life around the way you want it that's not so stressful or full of jealousy and hate...the way you think guys are disgusting isn't healthy to have that hate inside you, it's making you go into "protection mode" because you're feeding your brain with those thoughts that men are disgusting.    Medically, Psyhosis usually refers to schizophrenics or people can have psychotic episodes that only last a few hours if they are not schizophrenic.    The only therapy that really delves into the past is psychoanalysic therapy. (freud's)  Most modern therapy approaches today believe, YES THE ABUSE WAS TERRIBLE, but it's all about how we think of ourselves TODAY.  If you keep saying to yourself "Men are disgusting because I was raped and now I must always protect myself" that's YOU harming yourself! Do you see? it's not your fault you were abused or raped. The way you keep thinking about it now though is making you think you're psychotic!! See a therapist to help you change the way you think!    BTW, scientific studies have shown that those who suffered from abuse are more mentally healthy as adults than those who had great childhoods. So you are most likely not crazy. But just need to get your thoughts on the right track.|`|GdGwodM5aa	You're not psychotic, that's an over-used and misunderstood illness. You do however have issues, probably stemming from the abuse and could probably do with therapy to help you feel more secure and stable.
syT3XUAraa	Your dad was very wrong for telling you to do that. No parent should ever, ever tell their kid something like that. Some people in my dad's family have OCD, and I've heard that it can be genetic. I have problems occasionally, and sometimes worry that I may be developing it, but I've talked with a counselor, and found that I didn't. As for you, OCD can be a difficult thing to live with, and I would recommend seeking professional help, and maybe some mild meds, if you're comfortable with that. I know that just counseling and meds alone won't make it go away, but it will relieve it a lot. Hope you get better, and hope this helps. Good luck...|`|tnEIPjccaa	Your dad is an asshole. Nuff said. If I were you, I'd remove myself from that situation as soon as possible (if its an option).

I found them very helpful myself, when I was in school and having problems with my home life.|`|1INN3zyHaa	you should talk to someone IRL you trust. teacher, friends parent, other relative? are you in therapy for the ocd?|`|GdGwodM5aa	You need to get away from your dad, be it moving in with other relatives or staying with friends or whatever. No parent should ever say anything like that to their kids.   If you genuinely have OCD, you need to talk to your doctor and start to get help for it. It's totally treatable with techniques like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and in some cases meds.   It's time to take action!|`|EcqrbLz0aa	calm down and breath and tell your dad to cool it or butt out. i have ocd but i refuse to let it over take me. i just try to stay calm and be happy and dont ever let your family or ocd control you.just stay strong|`|AAIMeYeFaa	Get a job, find friends, get hobbies, go out on weekends, and spend as little time as possible at home. Slowly gain more and more independence until you don't need to come home at all. Then don't. Then emancipate yourself if you're still under 18 so that you can have your name on the lease at your apartment. If your parents ask how much money you are making at your job, lie  by about $100 a paycheck and make sure they can't get at your bank account.    Eventually your dad will be a memory, and you'll have your own life under your own control, and room to solve your own problems.
phWUBtviaa	Yes flat feet will give you more problems than arched feet.  Make an appointment with a foot doctor to get his opinion and he would probably order the correct size of arch supports, as there are different kinds.  When I was growing up, shoes were designed and constructed with arch supports.  Now its all about how they look and not feel.  Shoes these days are ruining our feet.|`|enokoZ6Uaa	That is something you should go see a paediatrics for until then you should wear shoes that give you alot of support.|`|T53Xg3c6aa	You should probably go to your local podiatrist - i had the same issue and they arranged for me to wear an insert in my shoe...really helped!

Talk to your doctor or the manufacturer for free or low cost insulin.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Let's just say that insulin was available on Craig's list - would you buy it???  It could be out of date, or have been sitting in the sun for days or something.  I'd never even think of buying insulin from a stranger!!  I had issues with my insurance company and what they were charging me for test strips.  I called the company that make the strips and got a great deal!  Try calling the company that makes the insulin, or call you insurance company and ask if you would get a better deal if you got the insulin by mail order (my HMO does that).    If you find unused or suplus insulin online somewhere, I'd discourage you from buying it!  It's too important to mess with!!|`|AA11017638	Here is the answer.

There is no eexcuse for you to allow your mom to interfere with your personal life. This is all part of becoming an adult.    Also there is never an eexcuse for allowing your mom to do this also.

djgHedtwaa	Do you use lotion? You might just be having some patches of dry skin, hopefully it's that and use a good lotion and see if it goes away within a few days. If it doesn't, it's possible it could be psoriasis or eczema (it sounds bad but really isn't) You just go to the doctor and he prescribes you some cream.
XByFpkrwaa	If only it was that easy to lose a pound (3500 calories = 1 pound).    Unfortunately it's not.  One hour of running burns about 500 calories.  So if you could run for two you could burn about 1000 calories.  However I recommend doing some weight training in there as the more muscle you build the more calories you burn during a regular day.|`|AA12182074	I'd like to know too.

I know that'd be a big deal, but you should be cautious about this.  You should also try real hard to explain why you self-harm, and that it stops you wanting to take your own life, it's not leading towards that.  But it's worrying you say you don't want to stop. It's easy to find comfort in the bad stuff because you know it'll always be there, but it's ok to try and find new coping strategies, slightly safer ones.  Good luck x

czhNL7xLaa	I have lost 10 pounds cus i had to get my wisdom teeth out to all i was able to eat was broth soup. I lost it i n 1 week. I am going to tell you what to eat and do to lose the pounds.  monday work out 1 hour, 30 min cardio and 30 min weights. Do squats with 5 pound weights in your hands, and (don't forget to strethch after your cardio very important, do cardio first b4 your weights).  do the same thing monday to thursday.  when you get home from working out (make sure you don't eat 2hours b4 your workout) put a scoop of protein shake mix in the mixer and i cup milk (skim or 1 %) and mix. there is chocolate, strawberry shakes any kind go to GNC and get one. Make sure the label says no more then 2 grams of fat and at least 23 g of protein. for breakfast have a slice of bread (with peanut butter if you want) and a cup of milk and then 1/2 cup of yogurt (make sure the yogurt is "astro ZERO" (cus it has the least fat and sugars) and put a 1/2 handful of honey granola in the yogurt and enjoy. (granola with honey or nuts or plain) lunch cook stirfry with frozen veggies. You canhave chicken breast or beef. Please have a small size portion. then snack have a fruit (apple) with almonds (handful size amount). Supper AFTER YOUR WORKOUT anything PROTEIN will do. That shake i told you earlier or a chicken breast size of your palm only or 3 eggs. WITHOUT the yolk. After you boil the eggs take the yolk out and eat ONLY the white part. It will be hard the first week but after the 2nd week your body should get used to it and will get easier.|`|AA11548204	60 lbs in 5 mnths|`|niZBsn9Qaa	recently i have lost 11 pounds in 16 days by exercising 6 days a week and eatring between 1000 and 1500 calories a day.

8fed9008b158687344f0fa29b75538c1aa	Any type of eating disorder will throw your body out of whack.  Because you deprived your body of necessary nutrients for so long, it will without a doubt affect your metabolism, hormones, and mood.  Your body is basically getting over from being thrown into shock.  Having said that.  Eating disorders do not cause any type of pre-mature menopause, so erase any worries about that.  The hot flashes you are experiencing could stem from any number of things.  Just make sure when you do get in to see a doctor that you tell him/her about all of this.  They will know what to do for you.  In the meantime, your body is still trying to heal itself and get itself restored to it's natural state prior to your disorder.  It may take time, but as long as you are on the right track to eating healthy, taking care of yourself and following the dr.'s orders, everything else will fall into place.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	i would go to your doctor, no one will know better than him or her|`|RZ4l6s65aa	Get.thou.to.a.doctor.

Lgo6UX12aa	I know that it's not what you want to hear - but it's not healthy to lose that much weight in that short of period. Mainly because it's likely you will gain it back plus more. So do your best to lose it in a healthy fashion - situations like this can cause eating disorders and they're not fun. *Trust me* They are just a temporary fix.    With me and my body - weight training does nothing for me. I mean - it's good to have it in a workout routine cause it tones as you lose the weight. It's all cardio for me. Cardio Cardio Cardio! As much physical activity as possible. Whether it's a treadmill or a video. The only thing that keep sme going on a treadmill is the television. It sounds stupid and lazy - but it keeps me distracted and next thing I know I've been walking/jogging for 45 minutes and feel great! It's good to cover up the top of the treadmill with a towel or a magazine so you aren't constantly looking down at it. It's VERY frustrating and distracting. So you WILL see results if you keep it up - but I would definitely add more cardio. You'll see weight fall of if you maintain a healthy regimen.     MAKE SURE you are eating healthy too. (This does not mean that you just *stop* eating all together.) Lots of fruits and vegetables. Read up about negative calories.   http://www.negativecaloriefoods.com/inde...  Swap out Hamburgers for Veggie Burgers (when cooked right, they can taste delicious!) Beef is pretty fatty, so try to cut that out for now, or limit it. Lay off extra seasoning and condiments. Food will get a little boring, but you'll find ways to make it taste okay! :)    BEST of luck and I hope your prom is everything you want it to be! Way to take charge of your life!|`|sqaRnidQaa	not possible without being on the verge of death. your obviosly going to have to eat healthy and start counting your meals. you probly will be able to lose 30 pounds.you can always go to rite aid and look for those diet pills that say thy make you lose weight 4 times faster|`|VEkx9lHOaa	probably like 40-60lbs but even then its pushing it. 100lbs in that short period of time cant be a healthy loss.    you should check out this website i posted.

I wonder if you have ever watched the biggest loser? (Not to offend) but people on that show lose SO much weight within a small amount period... i think within weeks... so it is definitely possible. My question is what is motivating you to lose all this weight? So far you have been working out ...good... remember to constantly challenge yourself... i mean when it is easy then you are not working hard enough... also sprints are a great way to see fast results because your heart rate is moving fast. It usually takes about a couple of weeks to a month to start seeing results. Make sure that you are eating right. For me, eating is the hardest thing  to control because i don't like to count calories or starve myself but eating smaller portions and not stuffing yourself is definitely a way to help you lose weight. I don't know you but you should be proud of yourself for taking a stand. losing 100 POUNDS may seem like a lot so brace yourself. If you find that you can not lose it within your time period then do not get overwhelmed. YOU want to be healthy and feel healthy and that is what really matters. You can do it! Take one day at a time!|`|mYhuGonfaa	100 lbs is a LOT. 3 1/2 months wouldn't be healthy to lose that much unless you were like 600 pounds. The closer you get to a healthy weight, the slower it will come off. At first you will probably shed a lot, but take your time, any weight lost is a victory, if you give yourself a gigantic goal from the start line, you are setting yourself up for failure, start off with a goal of 50 pounds and looking more toned, then adjust your goal from there. You can do it, no doubt, but don't wear yourself out before you've even begun! Your workout plan sounds good , but you could add more than 10 minutes of weightlifting, and make sure that your eating is also on track. GOOD LUCK YOU CAN DO IT!!|`|fR2Geezcaa	There is no possible way to loose that much in that short amount of time, unless your ill.     The key to weight lose is to not to set unrealistic goals. When I was 17 I was about 230, I lost over a 100 lbs, but it took about two years. No diet EVER worked for me. It wasn't until I learned that it was a matter of having healthy eating habits (ones that you can live with for the rest of your life) and exercising.     The best thing I ever did was to throw my scale away! Stop worrying about the number's on the scale and worry about how you fell. I concentrated on feeling healthy and not what that metal box kept telling me.     Don't starve yourself either. You may loose a quick 20lbs, but your body will figure out that it is being starved and it will start to store fat and start eating away at your muscles. You will seem to hit a plato and won't be able to figure out why your not loosing any more weight. Any one knowledgeable in weight lose will tell you, you actually need calories to loose weight and to speed up your metabolism. Instead of three large meals a day, try six small meals. It is the best way to speed up your metabolism. Make sure you get enough protein too since you are exercising.|`|7CBN7LDXaa	Okay, so what your doing so far is really great, just keep it up and eat right and it will work. try to drink only water and eat really healthy while in the process of these workout routines and you will lose weight.

You can't lose that much in that little time!!!! Best bet, join like weight watchers or something. With that much weight to lose, there's no way you're going to be successful without a support system. And I'm not saying this to be negative, it's just reality. ...It's going to take some time and def effort and work--which you'll need guidance and support on.     BUT, the good news is, they can help you drop the initial pounds so that you'll still feel good at your prom--even tho it's not 100lbs. ...And if you keep with their program, the next dance or wedding or event, you can actually be 100lbs lighter.     Good Luck.    *PS, one trick i use to help me eat less is i drink two whole glasses of water, and have an apple 30 min. before each and every meal. The water will make ur stomach feel full (not to mention it's great in shedding pounds), and the fiber in the apple, will also make u feel full so you'll eat a lot less. *Another advantage of the apples? They come in so many flavors--i.e., sweet, tart, sour, etc. You'll get so addicted to them that you won't even want candy anymore!!  :)    **Also, don't try any crash diets. They don't keep the pounds off, and even if you lost some on it, you'll have so much loose skin that'll look gross. But, losing it slowly, yet surely, will make u look so good!|`|sW8VQy4Qaa	Just keep up what your doing and you should see results it takes awhile, and you wouldn't be able to lose 100 pounds in 3 months..

You are not allowed to eat bread of any kind, pasta, rice, crakers, cereal, oatmeal, potatoes, any kind of fruit or white veggies. No milk or yogurt, no sweets of ANY kind, no cakes, masses, pizza, nothing involving bread at all.    things you are allowed to eat as much as you want for the month:    All veggies except white ones  all the meats of any kind as much as you want  cheeses, all kinds, all you want  eggs, prepared any way  creams, oils, margerine and butter, mayonaise    I promise you if you only eat what's on that list, the weight will dissapear    make sure you drink as much water as you can, and DONT CHEAT. The way this diet works is that it forces your body to burn the only thing it can for fuel, FAT. I know you're eating fat, but trust me, this works. If you cheat, you'll throw your body off course and it will start hoarding the fat you eat. that's why when you come off this diet you have to eat HEALTHY or you will gain it back    Keep up the exercise. Try to go 20 full minutes on the treadmill (you dont want to break up your cardio session too much as you want to keep your heart rate above 140 for 20 solid minutes)    good luck to you|`|TWW5DGttaa	Don't try to reach an exact weight by a specific time-especially THAT much in THAT small time frame-it's not healthy! you need to stay healthy always, but never to the extreme. If you work out way too much or starve yourself you will not see good results. you need to take care of your body and treat it with respect no matter what size it is. Eat often, eat small meals throughout the day, eat when you are hungry stop when you are full, eat protien with every meal especially since you're diabetic and need to keep your blood sugar steady. Eat whole grains for enrgy not too much straight up sugar unless you are about to do cardio then eat a banana. But losing 100lbs in that time frame isn't very likely, and you will mess you're body up then maybe put it all back on after plus some. Be smart|`|3jGGzCUJaa	not healthy or naturally you could do it with plastic surgery but to my knowledge you couldnt lose that much naturally & be healthy. Sorry. It will help but I think your goal is just a bit high that's all.

Your exercise is good so far - remember to increase the level of exercise as you get fitter (say once a week - increase the amount) If you keep this up you'll definatly lose some and tone up.    The other part is your diet...if you cut back to about 1300kcal and keep exercising it will drop off. Eat about 5 SMALL meals a day instead of 3 big ones because this increases your metabolism = more calories burnt! Eat things with a low fat content...so plain cereals, unbuttered toast for breakfast, lean meats like chicken and fish, plenty of fruit and veg and spaghetti and rice. Treat yourself once a week though...makes it easier to maintain =) Oh and take vitamin and iron supplements if you can.  You're going to be hungry but drink water and find some low/non fat snacks (preferably with little sugar), slowly your stomach will shrink and it will get easier.    Um...you could maybe lose about 30-40lbs before then?    I hope this helps...and good luck. =)|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	No, it is not possible, nor is it healthy. The most you could possibly lose by the end of May would be around 30-35 lbs. It is safe to lose 1-2 lbs per week.     You're not exercising near enough. For serious results, you should do cardiovascular (running/jogging/brisk walking, biking, jump rope, etc.) 3x a week for at least 60 minutes. On top of that, you should do interval training 2x per week for 25-30 minutes. This consists of going at a moderate pace for a minute, and then going as fast as you can for 30 seconds to a minute (try to work up to a minute). You can use any form of cardio for this; I find that the elliptical trainer works well for this and is easier on the joints.    You'll need to lift (weight train) for at least 20-30 minutes 3x per week. Try to do total body exercise (squats, lunges, chest presses, deadlifts, etc.) and try not to rest too long between sets. Should do 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps each. Look online for some good beginner exercise programs (try shape.com or womenshealth.com).    Finally, if your not eating healthfully, you're wasting your time. Try to keep things as close to "nature" as possible for the next few months... Veggies, fruits, whole grains, etc. If you can't pronounce the ingredients on the label, don't eat it! And lots of water, lots! Also, NO SODA- it's the biggest diet killer out there! Smaller portions are key as well.     Good luck!|`|MzWM9rBRaa	That is a lot of weight to lose in a short amount of time, and if you plan on doing anything see a doctor about it.

Also, you need to gradually increase your workout duration and intensity for best results.  Another factor is your caloric intake.  Also, drink lots and lots of water, all day long, and no more eating after dinner.|`|47f4aea952fcce1b0da230bc40a4bfeaaa	On the biggest loser they work out for 8 hours a day.  and the most i remember is 30 lbs the first week and then 15 or so each week after.  i think 100lbs is too much to shoot for.

Cut it all out. i havent had a chocolate in about 1 - 2 months now and im not even bothered. Hope this helps. Good luck|`|AA10279901	You'll essentially kill yourself.  Its possible, but it'll be alot better for you to keep what your doing up and you'll get results.  In fact, increase the difficultly of your workout every 3 days or so by just a little.  Don't stop AT ALL for ANYTHING.  The first few weeks/months are the most important as far as sticking to it is concered.  Later on you get used to it, and eventually it becomes a natural part of a healthy  rutiene.|`|d53GV2W0aa	It is possible to loose that much in a year. Although, you have to be very dedicated.  The most effective workouts are cardio workouts, like riding a bike and the treadmill, which you are doing, which is good.  Having a good diet also helps. You defiantly don't have to starve yourself, but keep up on your fruits veggies, which some grains and proteins.  It might be a good idea to talk to your family doctor or a physician if you're really serious about it, they'll help you out.|`|FNeCDm3raa	No way.    Safely, it would take about 1 year or 52 weeks to lose 100lbs. SAFELY.    Unsafely, and you could die, or just end up yo-yoing and gaining it all back.    I'm sure it did not take you 3 months to gain that much, so it's going to be 3 months to lose it.    Sorry.|`|76DMnYwnaa	hun 260 doesnt make u fat!! but no its not healthy for anyone to lose 100 lbs in 3 months! but u have diabetes u messing with ur weight can really mess with your health...why dont you go your doctor and let him know what your thinking and ask for help... you might be able to lose 30-50lbs but you should really be careful!|`|n6DGucxNaa	i wont lie, in normal circumestances yes it is possible - however every one is different and you would have to restrict to only three tablespoons of watered down soup three times a day - when you do start eating again your body may - if you are not diciplined enough to hold it back - go into hunger overload and you may end up with binge eating disorder - or worse go into anorexia drive - but yes it is possible - please dont do it this way i am a bulimarexic and i am in constant pain - sometimes i feel my heart slowing down or pumping hard and having difficulty - i get scared that it might stop and my internal organs - especially my stomach area is agony - these are real life threats for me every day i dont want them to happen to anyone else|`|fkuKHXqJaa	NO!|`|9kRFGagaaa	well i don't think it is possible to lose 100 pounds that quickly, but i think you are on the right track, though when you exercise it must be along time to get your heart rate up, try to go longer on the cardio workouts, you have to build stamina. i learned thats the best way. you may be able to lose 50 pounds, and exercise will do nothing if the person is not eating right. so i hope i helped you :) i hope you can get to where you want :) good luck :)|`|tnEIPjccaa	It is great that you've decided to take control of your life and start trying to shed those unwanted pounds. Go you! But, that is far to much weight to lose that fast. Its not healthy. Take it a little slower. 10 months is a much more reasonable time frame to lose that much weight. I know you want to be thin by prom, but if you lose that much, you will most likely make yourself sick. Even though it'll take a little longer, it'll be much healthier for you in the long run, and it will still be a HUGE accomplishment. Good luck on your journey!

52JF62fzaa	One day would not do you any harm. Just remeber to drink plenty of water during that day, and don't over load the next day (you'll gain it right back) instead start eatting smaller portions, more fruits and veggies, whole grain, lean meats, low fat diary products, and lots of water. Take a daily walk too, and give yourself a SMALL reward the end of the week (like a slice of cheese cake.) This is similiar to what I have been doing, other than I "cleanse" myself during "weekends". Which means on the weekend I eat nothing but fruits, veggies, and water to drink.|`|AA11548204	fasting to lose weight is silly...mix cardio with toning workouts and stick with a balanced diet your whole life dude...|`|tnEIPjccaa	Fasting is a very bad idea. Fasting causes your body to go into panic mode. After you fast, your body will save and store every bit of fat you put into it, which completely counteracts any effect you hopes to get from fasting. The best way to lose weight is to eat a low fat, low calorie diet, and excersize, even if its only walking a half hour a day.|`|7e18bb295cf862452eff4f8aaa2423a3aa	Fasting once a week won't make much of a difference.   When you eat the next day you'll gain all the calories back.

VnLaUS3Jaa	Be sure to work ALL of your 5 major muscle groups (core, shoulders, chest, back and legs)     MONDAY: shoulders (upright rows, arnold presses, front raises, side raises, reverse flyes),   TUESDAY: chest (flat, decline and incline bench press, push-ups, cable crossovers, scoops),   WEDNESDAY: back (t-bar rows, bent db rows, seated rows, pull-downs, pull-ups),   THURSDAY: core (omg there are so many examples!)   FRIDAY: legs (squats, sumo squats, deadlifts, lunges, leg presses).     do not focus on just one part of the body, as many people tend to do (women tend to focus only on legs, men = chest & biceps)    note: when you do chest (push) exercises you are also working your triceps. when you do back (pull) exercises you are also working your biceps.    to get lean and toned muscles, you want to do 2-3 sets of exercises per muscle group, 12-30 reps at a semi-challenging weight (rated about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest).    to get bulk/strength, do 4-6 sets of exercises per muscle group, 4-12 reps at a challenging weight (about an 8 or 9 on that scale of 1-10)    keep a workout log. increase in weight 2-5 lbs per session, reps 3-5 reps per session, and/or sets per session. you will need your log to keep track. don't depend on memory.    weight training increases your metabolism, making your metabolsim at it's highest (vital for weight-loss). and while your metabolism is at it's highest, that is the best time for cardio, b/c this is when you are able to burn the most calories.    just mix things up once in a while as not to feel "routine-like" and seeing your progress on paper as well as in the mirror will keep you growing strong and keep your spirits high!      good luck, hope this helps

You should feel tingling with your hand that will be confirmation of a spiritual cause. Such a situation is a blessing for you.

tkDfqjQdaa	I have had colon hydrotherapy before and find it very useful.  http://www.colonhealth.net/colon_hydroth...  You can find some video on YouTube if you want to see what a session is like.  Here are the reasons I use it.  Although, good fiber, good bacteria, and healthy living will do the same thing over time, I like a good kick start especially when my living hasn't been so healthy.  CH is a good way to clear the deck and start fresh.  It helps to quickly clear out accumulated waste, gas, bacteria (good and bad so you need to put the good back when you have one done http://www.natren.com/healthy_trinity.as...  and  http://www.newchapter.com/products/all-f... ) and yeast.  I don't know if you feel "cleaner" when done but certainly "lighter" and I have found my thinking is less cloudy, my spirit feels lighter and my outlook just generally improves.  Once the colonic is done I'm sure to eat light for the next day or two with plenty of raw fruits and vegi's.  I use colonics as a mini cleanse about 4-5 times a year.    As a side note...an enema is a completely different thing and I would NEVER  use tap water.  All professional colon hydrotherapists will use filtered water and if you try anything like an enema at home you should do the same.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it's called a tap water enema, and you will perhaps have a lot of cramping, and it will throw off your electrolyte balance and if you are not constipated, I would not recommend it.

It is too sensitive of an area that is not made to take any sort of water pressure like that.  You can seriously tear your colon and do much more harm than good.

I can't imagine why anyone would elect this type of treatment...|`|3765a890ec73a001872517a48b355f97aa	Colon hydrotherapy is an alternative health care method that gradually and gently cleanses the colon by flushing the large intestines with warm water. A special system approved by the Food and Drug Administration is used to carry out the procedure.    Colon hydrotherapy is a procedure that consists of gentle infusion of water in and out of the colon, reaching all four to five feet, improving a person's overall health and sense of well being. But you should know that colon hydrotherapy is not a cure, or some miraculous form of medicine, just a valuable procedure used to help our body heal from a wide range of health conditions that have resulted from improper diet and elimination habits. Simply put, colon hydrotherapy is not a treatment, it's a preventative measure.    A colon hydrotherapy session is equal to 20-30 normal bowel movements. During this procedure, the patient lies on a treatment table and inserts a small speculum into the rectum. Then the therapist begins to monitor the temperature of the water infused into and out of the large intestine, as well as the pressure within, by way of the inbuilt precision equipment. The main advantage of colon hydrotherapy is that it removes all the waste that has been stuck in it for years without causing any stress to the individual, the process is clean, simple and efficient.    When colon hydrotherapy is done, you will feel your body completely rejuvenated, as a large part of the toxins will be removed and quite soon after that, the colon will return to its normal, natural shape and function ability. Another benefit of the procedure is that it restores the normal pH balance to the body; it also stimulates the immune system, allows free passage of nutrients into the blood, prevents toxic absorption into healthy mucosa and strengthens natural muscular contractions in the colon as well.

xfpJGBfwaa	You're experiencing overtraining.  Do you have a book called Lore of Running by Tim Noakes?  It's a huge text, but it explains tons of studies done about championship runners.      In short I have these words of advice for you:    1. Get K20, which is "Kellog's Water" and has a little bit of protein in it to stave off hunger.  It's the simplest way to stop the hunger feeling you're having all the time.      Another way is to get an unflavored protein powder and add VERY SMALL amounts of it to your favorite drink.  Specifically, it should be a drink you can have instead of water (which makes it complicated, that's why I tell people to use K20).     2.  Are you getting enough carbs?  Do not avoid carbs if you're exercising heavily.  Within two hours of a workout, have a high carb meal.    3.  You should be taking in small amounts of sugar while you exercise.  Otherwise your brain and heart starve and produce fatigue, slowing you down.  If you can trust yourself to suck on a piece of candy and not choke, do that (or a gummy bear, or a swedish fish), but if you get dizzy while running long distances, just drink something with a little sugar in it.      For many reasons, some athletes like YS Bee Farms Alive Bee Power mixed into their workout water (just small amounts).  I'd have to explain for pages why that's a winning combination, so you might want to research it yourself.      I shouldn't have to tell you to take a multivitamin and multimineral with calcium and magnesium in it.  That should be a no brainer for any athlete.  But you might consider finding one that is time released, or "sustained release."      To stop the overtraining feeling, you have to get some extra rest.  Sleep if you can, but just lie down and close your eyes.  Maybe listen to soft music, and breathe deeply.  Overtraining will make your body produce way too much adrenaline, until it's exhausted and then you're tired - in a cycle, until you get enough rest.  In the early stages you're just really hungry all the time because adrenaline robs you of blood sugar.  As your blood sugar drops, you get that hunger sensation.      To answer your question, yes, it's ehical for you to lose weight.  It will help your body to deal with the blood sugar swings better, and since you're distance running, it will make it easier on your body to run.      If you've been gaining because of protein drinks, then you need to stop right now.  Those things can do a number on your kidneys and can push the process of adrenal exhaustion further than if you weren't using them.  Or just cut back to half or one quarter of what you were taking.  They can produce this "I feel like hell" feeling you just mentioned, all by themselves - if you're excluding real food for them.|`|sQbBGiqpaa	Well, some times when people gain weight quickly, it can mess up their sleep pattern, also if you're eating more.

Though ethics means to merely just practice what is right the line between right and wrong can many times be blurry. This article sh  ould help you ask the questions that need to be answered to come to a decision about whether or not the decisions you are making inside of your company are ethical or not.    Ethical Dilemma- This first road block in making a decision is one of the hardest to overcome. An ethical dilemma is purely a problem that has no clear answer. An example is that a shoe company wants to keep the production of making their shoes down so that they do not have to pass the costs to the consumer and so that they can make a larger profit. The ethical dilemma appears when they must make a decision to either outsource to a third world country were working conditions are considered horrible or lay off employees that they already have. One way of making a decision to an ethical dilemma is the WPH approach.    WPH approach- This approach to an ethical dilemma is a three step process that offers those who manage a business guidelines for making that decision.    1. The (W)ho- Who would this decision effect and how bad would it affect them? When looking at the "who" you must take into account all of the stakeholders in this decision. In the first situation it may only seem that the employees will be affected by the decision you still need to take into account how the shareholders, customers, management, future generations, and the community where the business operates will be affected.    2. The (P)urpose- What is the purpose of making this decision? You must take a look at the reasons why these decisions are being made whether it is for efficiency, security, freedom, justice, productivity, or size.    3. The (H)ow- Now that the "who" and the "purpose" have been answered the next step in making an ethical decision is "how." The three main types of answering the "how" question, are the public disclosure test, the golden rule, and the universalization test.    a) Public Disclosure Test- When making a decision using this method you must ask yourself whether or not you would want the information to be disclosed to the public. If the answer is no then the decision is more likely than not to be unethical.    b) The Golden Rule- Put quite simply, treat those around you with the same respect and dignity that you would want them to treat you if they were in your position. If you can honestly say that you would be happy with the decision that is made if you were the one being affected by it, then you are making the right choice.    c) Universalization Test- When growing up everyone has a role model whether it is their parents, a friend, or an athlete. When making a decision you need to ask yourself whether or not you are setting a good example for others to follow by.    Looking back to the first example it is now easier to figure out whether or not the shoe company should outsource its production or to lay off some of their employees.

If you feel like you have an eating disorder you should see a doctor who will give you the right advice on many calories you should be taking in each day.  Also your exercise and diet should not be affecting your sleep in this way so that could be a problem.  As far as the weight gain goes, muscle weighs more that fat so if you are doing some sort of weights or muscle building exercises then you should expect to gain weight.  If you are not gaining muscle then this could indicate some sort of issue with your thyroid.  I would see the doctor if it concerns you...|`|N9nJWYa5aa	It's more than ethical, you have possibly fallen into one of the mental traps of exercise.  I'd advise you to get a cheap body fat monitor and pretty much ignore your weight.  If your level of body fat is increasing then you are fooling yourself and eating too much (many people tend to overestimate the energy they use during exercise).  There is always the possibility that you are piling on muscle in which case, so long as the result isn't too extreme then carry on.|`|AA11316988	Don't worry - it takes time for your metabolism to adjust to extreme changes in calorie intake/expenditure. Eat lots of fiber to quell your appetite, limit yourself to 2000-2500 calories/day, and don't go near the scale. Once your metabolism regulates itself, your weight will level out. There's absolutely nothing wrong with occasionally yo-yoing weight.    And you don't have an eating disorder. That's psychological.      ***Oh, and what do ethics have to do with this? You're not starving yourself...you're HELPING your body.|`|fR2Geezcaa	Your gaining weight because your building muscle! I gained ten pounds and lost a pant size when I first started working out at my gym.    You can damage your muscles by not providing your body with enough calories and believe it or not, you need calories to lose weight! If your "starving" yourself your body will begin to store body fat and eat away at your muscles first. The key is healthy eating habits and exercise. The best way to speed up your metabolism is to eat 6+ SMALL meals a day and not 3 big meals a day.     Starvation is NEVER the key to weight lose. You may lose a quick 20 lbs but your going to feel like "hell" and it only does your body more damage than fat ever would. Remember food is fuel for the body.     Stick to low carb and high protein meals. Complex carb's such as pasta, bread, and some fruits and vegetables are complex carb's aka sugar. When in doubt green vegetables and meat are they way to go.|`|FcqOie0zaa	You don't have a disorder. Gaining weight can be frightening, even if you are still a normal weight.  I know you are training, but maybe you should cut back on all the exercise. You have an unusual situation... too much exercise is causing you to gain weight! Relax a little and prepare for it in other ways like meditating, toning exercises (sit ups, squats) and visualizing and planning out what you will do on the marathon.

Men are attracted to large boobs, but not to women with large boobs.  If its not to attract men, why would you do it? To satisfy your own ego?

Never mind the cost.|`|qHGy9ra3aa	The Doctor  worked for 10 years ago charged $4,000.  A ReDo cost $5,000 back then.

Please remember that breast implants do not last a lifetime and need replacing/revising after a period of time.  Additionally, increasing the size of your breasts also increases the likelihood that they will sag quite considerably in the following 10-15 years and so there's a good chance you will need a breast lift to counteract this.  Both of these operations are usually more costly than the original implant.    I hope that helps.|`|atbAakXuaa	The price is you lose the dignity of being a completely real person.|`|MbBmocQNaa	1st Do Not Do It    2nd the price is anything from 3-7k|`|yULWldR4aa	Don't do it, You'll regret it in years to come.

5JxYYkazaa	Yes it would!      I think most of us forget to mention some or a lot of details when we go in to see a doctor.      Its important you let them know :    1) How and when things started  2) How and when they progressed  3) Medications, vitamins and supplements you might be taking  4) Your questions and concerns    Don't write it out in a letter format.  It's hard to read something like that to someone and make sure you both get each point by the end of it.    Instead, make a point form list.  You can mention your first point, discuss it, and move on to the next.  This way you go through it all and don't miss anything.|`|AA11693263	I had been seeing my doctor for 3 years for a chronic neurological disorder that causes me to be in pain from head to toe constantly. He was treating each individual symptom but would never put everything together as a whole. I wrote down everyone of my symptoms from day one that I have. (It took up a page and a half) before an appointment one day. I put it in front of him and had him read it. He was amazed and that he hadn't realized that I had so many issues going on. I am not waiting for confirmation testing for Multiple Sclerosis. It can take a long time but keep pushing your doctors to help you find out what is going on. And, yes, I am a big believer now in writing a letter to your doctor. I would suggest that you just silently place it in front of him and let him read it himself. I think that because my doctor actually saw that list in front of him was what helped me the most. Good luck and I hope it works for you.....if he still isn't receptive to what you have to say, it's time to move on to another doctor.|`|4onT0qUxaa	Absolutely. I have had this problem myself, where everything I want to discuss is in my head until the Dr. comes into the exam room and I inevitably forget important details I wanted to discuss. I usually take a list with me, so I can ensure that all of my concerns are addressed. You could either write the letter and give it to him prior to your appointment, or hand it to him when he comes in, explaining that your "stage fright" is preventing you from remembering the details you want to discuss with him. He will understand.
tnEIPjccaa	It could be possible that its the eczema or psoriasis manifesting itself in a different way due to damage to your skin from the cold weather. I have found that if my skin becomes damages due to weather (like a sunburn or dry air) I have a tendency to develop eczema or psoriasis on that area. You should see your dermatologist if it doesn't go away after a few days of moisturizing.|`|h2RWWIzUaa	i would take a guess at scabies...its usaully seen in between fingers and around creases & belt lines.|`|wlQOjcQWaa	It may be a mild case of scabies    Look it up on the internet and compare your symptoms to the ones listed.   And go to your doctor, they should be able to tell.    You really should check soon, because if it is scabies and you don't get it taken care of soon, it will spread and get alotttttttt worse. And you could give it to those around you.
qDl5Gegbaa	**You sound like are at a great weight! Don't let anyone discourage you, they are just jealous ha ha    It's not very good. I would try half of a whole wheat bagel if you are trying to eat healthy. Use a low-fat creamcheese. I mean one bagel probably won't ruin you, but it's a great way to still enjoy it w/out cutting it out of ur diet.    *Whole wheat is extremely better for you because it is complex carbs. They take longer to digest, make you feel fuller, and don't get stored as readily as fat like your simple carbs. Most bagels are simple carbs.    Again, if you are trying to eat healthy, It's best to eat more protein in the morning, like scrambled eggs with a peice of fruit and toast. Save those carbs for lunch when your body is using the most energy - its' less likely to stick as fat.  ____________________________  If you are interested here are some good protein breakfasts to play with:  Salmon on whole wheat toast. try to avoid any mayo, use low-fat if you must  Scrambled eggs with fav veggies  Chicken/Turkey or Ham on whole wheat toast with an egg and tomato.  Tuna and toast  Small portion of steak and egg, yes seriously :)  ______________________________________    FYI ON WHOLE WHEAT: Whole grain foods are loaded with fiber which results in modest caloric reduction. Carbs from whole-wheat are digested and enter the bloodstreem more slowly, this also prevents from spikes in bloodsugar...so yeah, it does matter.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	too many carbs in a bagel for daily consumption|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Bagels aren't the greatest when dieting. They have a lot of carbs and the cream cheese might be low fat but there is still a lot of cholesterol. Try an all bran muffin (still a lot of carbs but less fat) or try oatmeal and fruit. I think it's so nice that your husband brings you breakfast. That's so sweet.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	There's a lot of carbs.    For breakfast, the best thing you can eat is something high in protein. Lots of good nutrition, and will keep you feeling 'full' for a long while!|`|1l04qpOKaa	Yes it is good for you. Are you eating the plain bagel's? Plain ones have no nutritional value. ry a whole wheat one, those are much more healthier. And a big breakfast is the best time to have a big meal b/c you have the whole day to burn it off. There is nothing wrong with bagels, and low fat cream cheese is alwasy better than regular ones. They may even have low fat bagels too but I'm not positive   :o)|`|EevMUAqJaa	Though they're good twice a week or so, I'd 86 the daily part. Bagels have a lot of carbs, and cream cheese may appear sinless, but it has more calories than you could imagine.  A healthier alternative would be fruit. Ask your husband to make a fruit salad. The natural sugar in it will keep you up and about at work. :)|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	it depends what you put in it|`|pWA3gybAaa	its very fattening pure carbs|`|FO4cSbBpaa	no your arms wil fall off ffs|`|pWbA7MRaaa	Plain bagels can be low fat, but bagels with raisins, or other additional ingredients can be fairly high in calories and fat. I think your husband sounds sweet. Give him a big hug when he brings your bagel and then just eat half of it! Congrats on your weight loss and goal. I'm working on that too.|`|kPx5kSbnaa	There is nothing wrong with one bagel in the morning with low fat cream cheese. If you are going to have carbs morning is probably the best time to do so,as it will help your metabolism kick in early in the day. Perhaps try a whole wheat bagel though or an occasional bowl of oatmeal with blueberries and whole milk. Also be sure to eat several meals a day with high protein content and small servings. If you only eat the bagel or very little else during each day your metabolism will slow and having a high carb intake will have a negative effect on your body.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	No, it's not healthy every morning. Are you eating the bagel alone or with cream cheese. That is fattening. What type of bread is it? Plain,wheat,grain? Don't be fooled by whole wheat-that's just added fat to it.    Fruit is more healthy every morning. Bagel is just wasted calories. Eggs are healthier too. Bagel is just bread.  You are setting a reasonable goal-that's good.   Try yogurt. Mix it up a little. Getting your body used to the same food every day won't help. Eating isn't just the only helpful thing. What kind of excersise do you do?

That explains it all; you are an oversensitive person. It's not a bad thing, I went thru it too. Crying over EVERY little thing. And of course the ds, etc made you happier b/c your mind was taken off of your emotions for a bit. I take Paxil for my emotional illnesses and I wouldn't give it up for the world. I feel sooo much better!! You are probably crying right now, huh?? Have your parents take you to see your doctor or go yourself if you're old enough. You'll be fine!!|`|CuVnpxh3aa	It is called depression but it is not serious. You are not suffering from depression per say but you need someone to help you feel better and get you out of the dumps. Try to continue to talk to friends and keep yourself busy so you don't get "down in the dumps" everyone has days like that so it is not serious, you just have to keep busy doing things you enjoy and talking to people who make you feel better. It is really nothing serious that you need professional help for.
2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	It may be so take extra safety precautions if you don't want to get pregnant.

xYTagSIyaa	You seem to be very dehydrated, this could be from caffeine usage or diabetes, or just not drinking enough.  You should increase your water intake to at least twice what you are having now.  The headaches, dry and irritable eyes and thirst and stuffy nose are all signs of dehydration.  Thirst can also be from diabetes not under perfect control.  You need to keep an close check on your blood sugars and maybe try a humidifier in your room at night.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	I would suspect dry sinuses.  Might try a humidifier in your room at night.  Before you go out and buy one, try boiling some water for about 10 minutes to hydrate the air and see if this helps in any way.  If so, the air is too dry.

Take a test soon and find out for sure. good luck.

Q4ggnG0waa	It's a little odd your doc would give you radiation for a benign brain tumor. If they get it all, it usually is a watch and wait thing. IF you got 30 doses of radiation, then yes, you're maxed out. I am maxed out on my radiation also...for a cancerous tumor. A child losing their hair is not a sign of a brain tumor. It's usually from malnourishment; some kids only want to eat certain things and that leads to nutrient deficiency.

0QKxeCmIaa	You have definitely stumbled upon the relationship between the food one eats and pain resulting from heartburn/indigestion/acid reflux/GERD etc. Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain which is generally regarded as a digestive aid, and it is apparently helping you to counter the heartburn.    However, repeated bouts of heartburn/indigestion can cause damage to your esophagus and other problems. Since you have demonstrated the relationship, what if you were to take it a step further and avoid the foods that cause the heartburn and indigestion in the first place?    I would suggest that you learn more about how to avoid experiencing the stomach pain. Here is a website where you can receive free information, sign up for a newsletter, get a cookbook and other resources: http://www.gtnp.info . The information that Sherry (the website owner) provides certainly helped me with my heartburn problems.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. First it is great you are honest.

Run or bike around a scenic area nearby. Get involved in a team sport!    Foodwise, start limiting yourself. Begin by removing one thing, like a snack, or just don't eat dessert.

Because if you are that seriously over weight your heart and lungs may already be stressed and you don't want to do yourself more harm then good.    Cut back on carbohydrates  ( bread, potato and pasta) and my biggest vise sugar.  There are a lot of good weight loss programs out there check them out and find the one that works the best for  you.|`|CCNEVnvPaa	weight watchers is a great way to start dieting.    if you join a gym they will stsrt a plan for you that could specifically help you loose weight|`|sQbBGiqpaa	I have the same problem, only, I'm not that fat, just slightly over weight ( thanks to a fast metabolism ! )   First of all, you might want to try eating healthier and filling things. I know everyone says this. Ha ha.  But things like raisins or dried cranberries are good because they are high in fibre and will clean out bad stuff from your system.If you eat this stuff,you can eat as much as you want and not worry about getting fat, so it's really good when you're feeling in a "snacky" mood. ( I usually snack when I'm watching t.v ) .  Drink lots, try and not drink alot of sugar.  And for fat loss the best kind of exercise is cardio, so try things like Jumping jacks. Or running, you don't have to run far or for a long time but try and get your heart rate high, if you're out of breath you're doing good. After you raise your heart rate walk to lower it, or do some other exercise ( push ups, sit ups etc) until your heart rate lowers, do not finish your work out with your heart rate up.  Also, adding jumping to simple things like lunges can make the work out more vigorous, raising your heart rate :)    And don't forget to stretch.  Hope this helps ! :)

Copper sulfate, also called bluestone, is a remedy that was used as far back as two hundred years ago. It is hard to find, but should clear the sore in a day or two. Consult your doctor before trying this.    Keep clean: Brush your teeth and rinse your mouth with antibacterial mouthwash often.    Stay away from salty and acidic foods.    For pain you can use any over-the-counter oral antiseptic gel or spray.    Using a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash can help clean out the canker sore and kill bacteria.    Rinse your mouth with salt water a.k.a. saline    Drink sage tea taking time to swish it around in your mouth with every sip.    Rinse with vinegar mixed with a spoonful of salt three times a day.    A baking soda / water paste applied directly to the canker sores can help speed healing.    Try switching to another brand of toothpaste.    Clove oil applied directly to the canker sore will numb it.    I always get them.|`|AA12196812	I would be concerned with infection - ask at the pharmacy what to rinse it with. Also, they sell this liquid for canker sores - really makes it hurt less (but it doesn't really help cure them, just pain reliever)|`|z12hxL7yaa	gargle with warm salt water and stop putting s**t in your lip that does not belong there knuckle head
7m5hYqlhaa	You need to eat A LOT of protein. Drink a protein shake in the morning and start running or whatever cardio excercise you like for about 30 min before you work out, It will help you build muscle and burn the fat on top. You need to work on light lifting and build up to heavier weights. When the protein is burned it bulks up your body so stock up on proteins before working out so you dont burn off what you want to essentially build up. Just keep eating lots of chicken and fish (lean protein) and legumes, beans, and nuts for omega 3 fatty acids.    these will all help you build up.    Hope I helped|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Eat a peanut butter sandwich and have a glass of milk just before going to bed every night until you reach your goal.
5I7Ifrmraa	Take a hot bath in 1 to 2 cups of epsom salt.  Drink a lot of water and take an over the counter pain med.  It will go away in a few days.|`|RBpVp7Q0aa	the epsom salt idea is a good idea...also make sure u keep ur muscles warm...doin the hot and cold wraps thing some people say to do really just makes ur muscles more stiffer. the body automatically tries to keep muscles warm...if it hurts a lot then tylenol works wonders for me
G3TEO6C7aa	no, but just look out for her a little bit, make sure it doesnt turn into an eating disorder. (which it probably won't but better safe than sorry)|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	no because if she loses that weight now it will be easier for her in the future. if she doesnt it will be harder to lose that weight later one when shes busy with a job and schooling|`|YZdTBWoCaa	Eating the proper foods, in the correct amounts is not a bad thing, at any age.|`|QaOj0nQLaa	Noo, i think that might be good for her and will give her a confident boost since she thinks her overwieght problem is in the way of guys finding her attractive. Just make sure she loses the weight a healthy way.  Good luck to her!|`|hTGu2ujeaa	You're never too young to get yourself to a healthy weight. As long as she isn't on a crash diet it is perfectly normal. Just watch that thse sn't starving herself - help her get a healthy diet and exercise plan.|`|AA11548204	she shoudnt diet at all...just get her into sports,dance and martial arts...stay on a balanced diet & those 30 lbs will be gone for good|`|1aFkPU7qaa	yes|`|vg3Tj90Naa	crash dieting is bad for everyone but normal dieting, not really if she's over weight  if she does it in a healthy manner|`|i1JVe24Oaa	yes.      jog.|`|ONQpHeycaa	No, she's not too young, but as her sister, you can make sure she does it in a healthy way without getting too obsessed where it turns into a disorder.  Try getting an adult involved too, to make sure she does it the right way, and exercises.  Maybe you can do it with her to give her the support she might need (even if you don't need to lose weight.)|`|RZ4l6s65aa	no cause it will be easier for her to lose weight and keep it off and gaine good eating habits Now rathr than when she is older|`|ArvEdl3paa	She should just focus on eating healthier, and at least not trying to gain weight.     She shouldn't lose it too fast, that is. Just focus on changing her habits so that she can feel better about herself.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Not at all. There are toddlers who have been put on diets by pediatricians. The sooner the better. It is obviously affecting her self esteem. Start by limiting or cutting out junk foods especially sugary sweets and dairy products. Limit bread to two slices a day and drink 64 oz of water per day. Dint forget to exercise a minimum of 20 minutes a day.|`|7OUzPdt2aa	shes not to young. she just needs a small diet plan and she should not get too obsessed in looseing the weight tho.|`|u87SJcKpaa	Yes she is too young.|`|4dXSD60Zaa	not too young.  dieting is fine as long as you don't go crazy.  if she's not happy with herself, let her do this..but know when to interject. tell her she only needs to lose 10 pounds, and what a difference it WOULD make.|`|tmYLGbNLaa	No, it's normal for people at 15 or something to try to lose weight.    And it's healthy to be in good shape.|`|yZrVMIs1aa	Being overweight is very unhealthy, it is good for her to lose weight exercise and eat healthy before it gets worse, good for her body and mind to lose weight.|`|OrGQ4iBVaa	No, but this can often lead to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa.    so, let her diet, but watch her carefully, and make still she's still actually eating.  you could help her, by going to the gym with her for support.|`|bC2ILdqOaa	u can have a diet at any age, it doesn't matter, it depends on what they think, if ur sister thinks she's fat, literally, well then she can go on a diet, but dont let her on a diet if she's skinny and still thinks she's fat because that can start problems.    hope this helps|`|EBsgq5Bbaa	aslong as she is doing it in a healthy way. Eating better, excercising more.. But i would keep your eye on her, because crash diets and eating disprders are very common in that age, and a very hard habbit to get over.|`|Yvn6uJC0aa	a 15 year old is not to young to go on a diet. aslong as she still gets the vitimins and nutrience she needs as a growing young adult she'll be fine. if she were to become a little more active and cut out sweets and soda's she'd probably drop a few lbs fast. 15 year old's metabolism's are so fast they burn most of the caloies they put in there body as it is. tell her to just eat healthy, do a little cardio for about 15-20 min a day 3 times a week, cut out sugary foods and not to eat late at night, "usualy 3 hours before going to bed" and she should even out.|`|qKayh9rvaa	No, she is not too young to diet.     She should make a lifestyle change that will help her for the rest of her life.     The first thing, is to introduce physical activity into your daily routine and gradually take away foods that are high in fat and calories.     For a 15 year old, you don't want to take away too many calories, because this is the most crucial time for development. Make sure she is eating whole grain foods, fruits and veggies everyday. Also, instead of sodas and juices, drink WATER!     Growing up, I was always heavier that my friends. But when I turned 16, I made these changes and lost over 80 pounds.     It takes just a little effort each day and soon it will become a lifestyle.     Good luck!!|`|wma3cn1Haa	I think she is a little too young, however if she wants to lose weight I suggest a healthier diet and lots of exercise. Some diets can cause a lot of problems for her if she starts now...i'd also be a bit concerned if she is a bit 'obsessive' of weight loss.|`|jI2dusqFaa	i think this is a perfect timing to let her do more excersises of cardio-vascular system ex running swimming or even kickboxing that will make her slim but do not do dieting this will make her body weaker when she will be around 60 or 70 .       but remember that she donnot do it too much exersise a once she needs to build it up over months.      if she is deermined to loose weight and does exersises everyday that makes her tired then she will find the diffrence in weeks but donnot give it up  and dont do dieting|`|u9OUV1tGaa	 dont think that it could be bad for her to probe a diet, but its advisable for her to attend to a gym, so as to make her feel like she is doing her best to get something she want. Maybe weight is not her problem. You and you family should help her to know that appearance is not the best way to judge a person. You should control her  to know the diet is not becoming an obsession, cause in that case it could be a bit dangerous. Get use to eat healthy and making exercises, and try to go with her during her diet. Make of health a priority before her appearance.   If her "Obsession" persists, you should go to the doctor to be advised about her situation.    But never, never make her eat something she dont want, or that is not in her diet, because she is running the risk of falling into a bulimia problem.      Everything you could need, Ill be pleasured to help you. Really, to make a diet its an important responsibility that should never be taken as a joke. If you feel a bit more worried, talk to your parents.      Bye!
AMCuX8XPaa	It's a bad bug going around this year.  And probably anti-biotic wouldn't do anything anyway.      Dr. Atkins mentioned using massive doses of vitamin A as a standin for anti-biotics.  100,000 IU/day.  Vitamin A won't kill bugs, but what it does apparently is help out and guarantee the integrity of tissue which is being killed by the bugs when you have a cold.  Use it as you would an anti-biotic - 15 to 20 day period.      Dr. Atkins mentions this in his book "Vita-Nutrient Solution" which you can get for about nothing off of Amazon - buy it used.  It's the best book I've ever seen about replacing prescription drugs with OTC supplements.|`|xsCEfOWuaa	not that i know of i used to go to spain and bring them back hear but you cant get them over the counter their now ether   but i think they should sell them over the counter hear it would take a lot of presser of the doctors too hope you get well soon
M0jedNssaa	It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. You can't 'make' someone become anorexic. Anorexia Nervosa is a psychological disorder characterized by obsessions with body image, fears of what food will do to the body image, and obsessions with control over one's body. The obsession becomes an addiction, an addiction to control. It won't go away on its own. Your friend needs help. Talk to her parents or yours, a teacher or guidance counselor at school, someone you can trust. Let them know you're worried about your friend and what's going on. Let your friend know that you're concerned about her and that you're there to listen if she wants to talk. Try to set a good example by eating healthfully. You won't be able to get through to her that she doesn't need to lose the weight. Her mind is not well, it is distorted right now.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	your friend has mental health issues, it isn't your fault, and if she says you are her example, then she is just using you as an excuse.  She is responsible for what she does, not you.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	try eating a balanced diet fruits ,veggies, milk, meat...etc.|`|72JZHunmaa	Try and eat more|`|aUTLstpAaa	Maybe your the one with the problem.  You need to talk to someone.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	Well i don't think that you influenced her to do that.  I mean she probably thinks you look good and wants to look good also so shes trying to be like you, friends generally pick up other friends habits and things about them that may not necesarily be good.  Like you see friends smoking together thats generally why.|`|AZtlB3VMaa	It sounds like you have, unfortunately. I think you should talk to her about it. Just tell her the truth ( that you think you may have something to do with this and that she should stop ). Go online and calculate her BMI with her (Body Mass Index) to prove to her she is in the normal weight range. If she is under the normal range, help her realize that it is very unhealthy and that she should stop trying so hard to lose weight.    As for you, your eating habits don't sound necessarily healthy either. Maybe if you are influencing your friends into anorexia there is something wrong with your eating patterns? Just an idea. Skipping meals won't solve your weight problems, just try to eat healthily and exercise if/ when you have the chance. There are plenty of small exercises you can do when you've got nothing else to do that can be fun!      Hope this helps!  Good luck with you and your friend!|`|yeYL8Udoaa	yes tell her its a bad habit...|`|ShPHh6OTaa	Well no one likes to eat when their friend is just sitting here. They dont want to feel like a pig, or bore you, so they wont eat. You need to eat something at lunch, if not for you but for your friend. you are obviously a big influence on her, and if she sees you eating she will think its a good thing. Just eat a little more everyday untill you are eating full meals again. Then if that still doesnt work, i suggest telling an adult.     What ever happens its important to do something soon.. 3/5 anorexics die =S    Good luck and dont worry =D x|`|CNgVwJgEaa	Truthfully, no one can say whether you have other than her.    If you want to be a good friend, talk to her parents straight away. Remember anorexia kills so it needs to be tackled before it takes over her life.    Good luck!|`|kNFH5lKnaa	Get your friend to start eating, Skipping breakfeast is always the important meal of the day.|`|bgnHRESjaa	sounds like your friend looks up to you and you have probably encouraged her to do the same thing as you. maybe you could tell her your story of pain and how it is a bad choice. maybe you could work together on a healthy eating plan. good luck|`|mymTKvJraa	probably not. It doesnt sound like you were really anorexic.   like you can eat a bowl of ceareal a day and survive, and be, for the most part, healthy. I eat a small meal a day.. not becauase i'm uncomfortable with my body or anything but i'm just fine. You don't need to feel at blame though, that's for sure. You aren't forcing them not to eat. just say that your doctor actuallly recomended your weight loss or somthing.. make something up.. TO HELP HER! and you shouldnt be starving yourself either! You should just walk a lot. Drink water. EAT small meals unless it's dinner, and exercise 45 min after dinner.|`|EMCKaSF7aa	People who have diseases like this already had problems.  You didn't do anything wrong.  I would talk to her and maybe go to your school guidance counselor.  Anorexia is a dangerous disease and could be deadly.  The best way to lose weight is to eat healthy.  Having smaller meals more often is a good way to lose weight along with eating healthy greens.  I use http://caloriecount.about.com/ to count my caloric intake and it has been working well.  Good luck!|`|Tp4R14rlaa	Well if you are anorxic it can cause so many things!!! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!! it can cause death because it can make u faint and if u faint u have a huge risk of hitting ur head somewhere like a sharp corner. Anorexia is extremely unhealthy. it just makes u lazy because u dont excersise! it also makes u look and sound so stupid. so just stop it and tell ur friend to stop being so dumb!! its for ur own health and life! oh yea and it can cause u to look pale because ur not getting any protien or vitamens. so wuts that point? yea u'll look skinnier but u will just come out looking hideous and unhealthy.|`|AA11133320	possibly|`|UgDOkQKKaa	no. only if you told her she was fat and i doubt you did|`|R0IfWBxfaa	i dunno, cause anorexia isn't "contagious", it's a mental illness|`|8159805006b5dedc78985dc1f9770ce2aa	I think you have. You should be happy with yourself whatever your weight is, at least your alive. Talk to your friend, tell her its bad and she might need help.|`|jtG41TXZaa	The Best Thing You can do is tell someone close to her like her family or convince her to go to a doctor if you really believe shes going into anorexia.|`|sbsbCTZGaa	If you are so body sensative than dont bother losing weight becuase if you would rather be thin and make you friends ill than fat with healthy friends then you are really selfish|`|lpyIKYUXaa	I think it depends on your personality, you must have a great personality if people are wanting to be like you and you must be addictive, so she might be doing in unconsciously.   Then again it might not be your fault at all, it could be something else, anything can influence anorexia nowadays.  Good Luck :)|`|OqLHt7Iiaa	Well, first off you're not eating to lose weight and you think that is okay then your friend will be influenced by this. Sounds like you have issues yourself. Maybe she feels fat along side you?  But let me assure you; anorexia is a serious eating disorder, generally caused by many things. Not just their friends dieting.|`|TCyASLBTaa	im sure that you dont need to lose much weight in the first place. i know what its like to be heavier then the people around you because all of my friends a super skinny while im not. but you should continue to eat normally, because if you dont eat enoug in a day your body will actually hold onto everything you eat, making you bigger.   your friend probably was influenced by watching you. the only way to get her to realize that she doesnt need to lose the weight is to sit down with her and talk to her, explain why she needs to eat and try and work through it together, explain why seeing your bones is a bad thing. my cousins used to be like that, they were so malnurished that they were rushed to the ER just for catching a common cold. it is severly unhealthy and you should try to explain this to her. but you also should try and not sound too pushy, this might just make her become defensive and will get you nowhere.
rJRyVZhvaa	My parents started the honey/cider/water drink about a month ago, and dad says he's not had any stomach problems (indigestion), and it helps him w/ burping! (the cider has a lot of natural enzymes, which everyone is missing from their stomachs).  As for weight loss, I'm not sure, but he's feeling a lot better, and has been soaking his feet in a 2:1 solution of water:cider, and it has helped also!  Hope when you try it, it works for you!  All the best to everyone!
nEVoabeSaa	You went to the Doctor with your symptoms and I assume the Doctor took many phials, small bottles of blood? If so he is doing a Complete Blood Count, Liver Function Test and other tests. However, before ordering a blood culture tests he first needs to know if you have a infection, be it bacterial or viral in nature. Therefore the results of the Complete Blood Count will reveal if you have 'any' infection. If they white cell count is increased and other white cells are increased then he might request a blood culture. However, this will only reveal that you have a blood born infection, in other words a hidden abscess, so far undetected has burst and the bacteria from the hidden abscess has now entered your blood stream.  http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/...  I would be very surprised if your Doctor just took one bottle of blood and ordered a blood culture.  Best of Luck|`|NZoHMFryaa	When they take a blood culture, they test for specific kinds of infections, to see what kind of bug you may have.     They use a different test, the CBC or complete blood count, to test for elevated white blood cell count (which would indicate infection) or anemia.    Your fever and run-down feeling may be any one of a number of causes.
RZ4l6s65aa	around 300-350 an hour depending on your motablasim and your weight  and yes it helps lose weight as its high intesaty cardio  i would say ballet would be a good choice cause that lengthens the muscles and uses alot of muscle that you would not use in any other type of dance|`|Q4686bQoaa	dnt know how many calories but it def help lose weight|`|hPkWZh3xaa	It depends on your weight, height & fitness, but this chart might help.    http://www.netfit.co.uk/fatcal.htm|`|AA11548204	its a cardio!of course it will,but change your diet for good ok??|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	oh absolutely...get a pedometer it will tell you.

Look at all the weight the celebrities on 'Dancing with the Stars' lose!     This is a link for benefits of ballet:  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    And this is a link for benefits of belly dancing:  http://www.atlantabellydance.com/Prospec...    One makes you feel elegant and the other makes you feel sexy and mysterious, so why not try both??

Type of dancing  Your current weight  Your height  Your food habit     But i'd say its a very good cardio (if it is fast paced) and a very good beginner workout.
v6It2zscaa	You need to go see your doctor. The symptoms you describe could very well be mononeucleosis. It can start with a mild sore throat and cough, and end up putting you in bed so fatigued you almost can't function.And the virus that causes mono, the Epstein-Barre Virus, may cause chronic problems like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.     So, please, go see your doctor ASAP.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Perhaps you are coming down with the flu, but that's generally if you are feeling achy and have a headache etc. I wouldn't worry about it though, there are lots of germs around in schools at this time of year.

1wDcYZhNaa	You might want to eat something small (like a bar small, or a piece of fruit) no less than 45 minutes prior to going to the gym, your body needs energy, but when you are exercising very little blood is going to your digestive system, which can cause nausea or vomiting if there is a lot of food in your stomach.|`|oHENw1AXaa	i wouldnt sit down and eat a whole meal before going to the gym because you will feel naucious. i would have a banana ofr somthing. but nothing more then that!|`|8e885c463613a2a46008f0074c740cbcaa	Not unless you REALLY have too, makes it harder to burn fat because you start burning carbs consumed first.  You should however eat a small portion of something healthy after you exercise ( a protein), your body will burn that up real fast and give you energy.  The easiest thing to do is set a specific eating time every day.  If you eat I say let it be like an hour or so before you exercise.|`|e9qmeBkmaa	your stomach should be empty when u go to gym. Atleast one hour or one and half hour gap before and after excercise.|`|hIe7qLN5aa	the best thing u can do for working out is eat a little protein before and after workout..esp afterwards.    after working out...your body needs protein..if it doesn't have protein then your body attacks the muscle rather than the fat...and of course we need it to be the other way around|`|U6C4Bywwaa	eat something for energy, or maybe even just a protein shake, and save lunch for after?
IM3QwSS2aa	basically as you would any other field of study.    I'm currently in Clayton College of Natural Health:  ccnh.edu    I'll probably get a sideline degree from this school:  http://www.trinityschool.org/|`|EW7PrvdSaa	I'm also a student at Clayton College.

5jf5tcMnaa	Rather than focusing on the cost, although that is a factor in your decision, you might want to ask the dentists some questions also.  Perhaps you might like to know how many veneer cases they have done.  Ask if they have a photo album that shows some of their work.  The dentist should be able to justify the cost they are asking expecially when one is 200 more than the other.
fR2Geezcaa	Low carb and high protein. Watch out for complex carb's such as bread's, pasta's, corn/carrots. Most smoothies are made from fruit syrup's which are high in sugar, and sugar is a complex carb! Next time you order a smoothie, ask to see what they are putting in it. There are way's to have a healthy one, no sugar added ice cream w/peanut butter is one.There is sugar in the peanut butter but it is a great source of protein. Be cautious of "low-fat" product's. If they are taking out "fat" they are normally adding more sugar to make up for the taste.    Instead of three meal's a day have 6+ small meals a day. It will speed up your metabolism. Anyone knowledgeable in weight lose will tell you that you need calories to lose weight.    For weight lose you need to concentrate on cardio work outs. The basketball is probably one of the best things you could be doing. Speed walking on a treadmill or bicycling is another. You may want to stay away from running/jogging it can lead to muscle and joint injuries and you don't want to be sitting on the bench watching the game.    For toning legs, tummy and arms, you have to weight train. My personal trainer said I was wasting my time using anything less than a 10lbs weights and told me to throw away my 5lbs weights. Another thing they had me do was to get an exercise ball, most come with a video to show you exercises you never would have thought of. It is a great way to tone up your muscles.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Ok little detail here but so far I lost 7lbs!    100 sit up daily-----it's really not that bad but realistic!    same breakfast everyday-----cereal: special K    Lunch same everyday---lean Hot pockets    Dinner whatever I  want---healthy of course    No snacks at all: No Soda, sweets or snacks. (except the weekends I cheat with some snacks had a smoothie on saturday)    Nothing but water or tea to drink.    Treadmill or walking 4 days a week.    This really is not a lot but its working for me! Let me know if you try it our how your doing!

bCmqScVlaa	Do you get routinely checked via endoscopy to get your varix banded?  This will greatly reduce the risk of bleeding.  I had PBC and a liver transplant.  I had about 9 banded and never had a bleed.  I also exercised regularly up till the day of my transplant.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	First of all, to lose weight, quit drinking soda pop. Even Diet Soda.   Start drinking water (H2o). Do some walking. Also, buy some ankle weights, and use them when you walk. Also, watch out what you eat.  For Breakfast, eat a bowl of Special K cereal, or Cheerios with Skim Milk.  For Lunch, eat a Turkey Sandwich, using Fat Free Mayo or Mustard, and a slice of Fat Free Cheese.   For Dinner, Eat some type of Lean meat, a can of vegetables, and some type of salad.  If you get hungry between meals, snack on some whole grain dry cereal like Cheerios or Shredded wheat.
Ar6wD9Oeaa	wow, we're like the same in two different bodies.    I can sleep all day long, but when it comes to the nighttime. once the sun goes down i'm full of energy. Let me just say i do not sleep all day, but i could sleep all day b/c i'm tired. I take care of my kids all day and they are 1.5 and 3, so i'm very busy all day long.  Last night i forced myself to go to bed at 10. i didn't fall asleep until 11:30 only to be woken back up at 12 by my crying son. Then again at 2 for my daugher and then at 5 for my husbands alarm clock and again at 9 this mornign w hen my kids woke up.  Sure i am getting some sleep, but it is so broken up and once i wake up it takes another 45 minutes to fall back asleep. my mind races. i do have a script for xanax which helps calm my mind while i'm trying to go to bed. But i wake up groggy after that . I was put on ambien to help, but it had a reverse affect and i could stay up till 3 am cleaning and doing stuff all over the house.    I think the first response you got will probably help alot, but it takes alot of effort and i haven't gotten myself around to do that.

Stress loads at work are going to keep your mind rolling even though physically you are drained.  Try planning (in writing ie daily planner) out each day of the week.  So you aren't spending time during each day figuring out what to do.  Organization will help a ton!  plan, plan, and plan some more...take one day of the week to figure out your upcoming week.  If you are eating fatty, sugary foods that include a ton of empty calories, your body won't have enough vit. and minerals, and energy to feed off of.  You need a healthy breakfast, Protein, carbs, and dairy (egg, cereal or oatmeal, banana).  Also find a well rounded daily vitamin for your micro nutrients(you need micro vits.)  Iron deficiency is common too ( lean read meat will solve that).  One way to see if your iron is low, check the inside of your eye lids (pull down your bottom eye lid, and the tissue should be pink, if it is white..anemia could be one problem.  Also, you need at least 30 min. of cardio 3 times a week.  That will help dramatically, even a fast paced walk works great!  Don't eat Chocolate before bed (contains caffeine) and watch the caffeine products through out the day.  I hope this helps, and if you need more info, ask me. This is still very brief|`|lAcqHNquaa	That does happen when we don't sleep, our senses get altered and reality seems distant.     If you can't sleep you can try to meditate, it doesn't replace sleep but it's a very good alternative.     Lay down somewhere, close your eyes and focus on your breathing, whenever you start thinking about anything else that's not how the air goes in/out tell yourself that you will be checking that out later.   Do this for as long as you feel comfortable (I do it for an hour).      Also try not to get very stressed over it because that fuels insomnia.

Solving this issue would require that people take some personal responsibility, and that is in short supply in these times.|`|4onT0qUxaa	Personally, having worked for a pain management Doctor, the first thing that comes to mind is prescription drug abuse. Many Doctors give out pain medications, muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and so on. They are all very legitimate treatments for many common ailments, and improve the quality of life for a great number of patients. However, there are a select few who quickly become addicted and sometimes even very ill, because they are not taking the medications as prescribed. Far too often, these patients are looking for that "high" instead of the pain relief, etc. The Doctors are forced then, to deal with patients who become absolutely abusive over getting more drugs, early refills, use multiple Doctors and pharmacies, etc. Their only recourse is to cut them off from the meds and refer them to a drug treatment program. There must be a better way. If I was a Doctor I would be much more selective about who I prescribed them for, how much I gave them, and which medications i approved.

Working out, such as weight training and cardio will take away a substantial amount of stress.  30 minutes of cardio a day.  Also, watch your diet, don't eat chocolate anytime near the time you go to sleep, and stay away from caffeine ( one cup of coffee is okay).  Diet is always going to be a key factor in health.  Veggies, grains, and protein all play a role in your mental health (Sleep habits).  You may also be overwhelming yourself with too many work hours.  Sit down, and plans your meals in advance, along with each day every week.  So then you know what you will have to get ready for each day..no surprises to scare you.

pW9KhTFvaa	Diet and exercise.  First make sure that your diet is right.  Low carbs and sugars especially.  To get cut, you have to minimize the layer of fat between your skin and the muscle itself.  Cardio will help the fastest.  Thinks like running and elliptical training are best for faster results.  Run at least a mile 3-4 times per week, lengthening your run as you develop better endurance to around 1.5 miles unless you are training for a race.  Weight training will help develop underlying muscles so that they show through.  Push-ups, crunches, leg lifts, benchpresses, curls, and flies are allm great.  Vary your routine every 2 weeks and use new exercises and different equipment at the gym so that you don't get too used to your workout and plateau too soon.  Try things like pilates and yoga, biking, swimming, and sports to keep yourself interested.  Most of all, once you start, remember it takes time and that this is a lifetime lifestyle change so don't be too impatient.  Work hard and live healthy and you will achieve this goal and so much more.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	the cheapest way to do this is to go running to lose the weight and use free weights/pushups/crunches to gain the muscle. my brother did that and went from a little pudge to a 6 pack as well as big arms/pecs and stuff in not very long.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	You should try to get onto Crossfit training... look it up on google.

nEVoabeSaa	I was caught in this as well, a Clerical Error. My GP was supposed to send a letter to the Consultant and it seems he did not, so I was a few years adrift of being seen. However back then I was not aware of how the system worked. So what you need to do is:  Consultant number 1 is Mr. Smith. He referred you to Consultant number 2, Mr. Jones.  Telephone Mr Jones secretary and asked for their fax number, write it down.  Then telephone Mr. Smith secretary and explain that you have been in contact with Mr. Jones and they do not have this referral letter so could she please fax a copy of the letter they wrote to Mr Jones at this fax number. The wait one day and telephone Mr. Jones Secretary and see if they have received the fax letter!  Best of Luck|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	Go back to your Doctor and tell him how your feeling, and insist there and then that he contacts the consultant, if that doesn't work write to the administrators of your local hospital or local patients panel your Doctor should know how to get in touch with them. They shouldn't keep you hanging about with any sort of lump time is of the Essence in cases like yours. lol
rbuBNDJbaa	About bulimia nervosa  If you have bulimia you have cycles of eating too much in a short period of time - often in secret. This is called binge-eating or bingeing. Bingeing often involves rapid eating of high calorie foods, often thought of as treats (eg chocolate and cakes). This is followed by a feeling of shame due to overeating.    If you have bulimia you then find ways of ridding yourself of the food or of the calories you have consumed. This is called purging. This may be by vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics (water tablets), excessive exercise, periods of fasting or a combination of these.  http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/...|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	I haven't, but if regular doctors don't work, try a doctor who specializes in eating disorders.

There is no approved or generally accepted treatment for bulimia. Generally treatment is predicated on a real or hypothetical relationship to other disorders, Some researchers have hypothesized a relationship to mood disorders. In consequence, clinical trials have been conducted with tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, mianserin, fluoxetine, lithium carbonate, nomifensine, trazodone and bupropion.Research groups who have seen a relationship to seizure disorders have attempted treatment with, phenytoin,carbamazepine and valproic acid. A third group has viewed bulimia as an addiction disorder, The opiate antagonist naloxone and naltrexone which also block cravings for gambling have been used There has also been limited use of Topamax which blocks cravings for opiates, cocaine, alcohol and food.  Some researchers also report positive outcomes when bulimics are treated in an addiction-disorders inpatient unit.None of these approaches have been consistently effective.|`|20ab769da4e60110c90b1a803ffda0cdaa	i think you need you to like yourself and respect yourself before you can start to recover i had bulimia and i had touch therapy which helped build my confidence. the more i learnt to love myself the less i binged and purged. i had to keep myself busy all the time to keep the urges at bay i had so many hobbies to keep my mind active. i don't think i will ever 100% recover each day is still a struggle but you have to fight    if you need a chat starmoonstorm@yahoo.co.uk|`|jesLLZXWaa	Hi.

B3jacMDeaa	One glass of wine or a beer is fine, but avoid heavy drinking until you finish the medicine.|`|tU8wLhIUaa	You should not have any. It isn't dangerous in the sense that sleeping pills and alcohol are, but it weakens the antibiotic. Any bacteria that haven't been killed yet that the body is going to handle with the help of the antibiotic that might survive because you take alcohol or because you stop taking your antibiotic will have a resistance to that antibiotic. This is why they keep giving it to you for a period of time after you feel better. The doctor wants to be sure as many of those germs as possible are dead. Any that survive will be antibiotic resistant and as they continue to breed will pass that along to their off spring making it harder to fight in the coming years.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Firstly  congratulations! I hope you have something fun planned to celebrate.     Periods normally last around 5 days, as long as it is under 7 days it is considered normal, but dont expect yours to be normal yet.     Because its your first period it could last much shorter or much longer, you will find at first your periods may be irregular as until adulthood your body will still be developing and hormones will be all over the place. Keep a record of when you get your periods to help you better predict when your next period will be, keep a note of changes to your discharge and moods too as you will start to see a pattern that will help you better understand your body and your periods. There are things that you can do to help regulate your periods too, as well as lots of things that make periods easier.     Change your pad every 4-6 hours.     If your pad gets full before that time then try a higher absorbency pad and change more often, if your pads dont get full in that time then change to a lower absorbency pad but still change just as often as if you dont bacteria will fester within the pad which isnt healthy. Its a good idea to use organic pads such as Cottons or cloth pads such as Lunapads as these are better for your health as they keep you dry which limits bacterial growth, these are also much more comfortable than commercial pads like Always.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Is this a serious question?

rpnFxnCQaa	Most people are aware that you can have plugged ears associated with colds, allergies, and sinus infections. However, muscular tightness in the neck and shoulders pulling on ears can actually cause ears to plug up. When our ears get plugged from muscular tension, it can prevent them from draining properly, and be a contributing factor in the development of sinus and ear infections (as opposed to sinus infections causing plugged ears).     Plugged ears can be due to muscular imbalances around the head, neck and chest area - especially those with uneven shoulders, scoliosis, neck pain and TMJ.    Remedy for Plugged Ears  Obviously, the remedy for plugged ears depends a lot on the initial cause.   Trigger point therapy is a form of self massage that is great for loosening up tight muscles.  By relaxing muscles that may be tight and pulling downward on the ears, trigger point therapy helps ears to open up and drain better, reducing the possibility of trapped bacteria causing sinus infections and eliminating a feeling of fullness and pressure in the ears.

This is actually not true. There are many ways to improve memory, to enhance it, and to compensate when your ability to remember seems inadequate. It should be noted that sudden loss of memory, especially among the elderly, might indicate conditions like Alzheimers and you should see a doctor, since there are medications which may forestall or slow down this conditions onset.    For folk who would simply like to improve memory, there are three main things that you need to enhance your brain function: adequate sleep, exercise, and good diet. These are a lot cheaper than the many memory enhancement tools on the market. Though some of these may work to a degree, others will not be worth their price. Any other types of devices or strategies you employ will be less effective without the big three.    If youve ever had to stay up for a full 24 hours, youll note that memory gets impaired quite quickly. In fact a recent study on students preparing for tests suggested that students who regularly pull all-nighters prior to taking an exam generally have lower grade point averages than people who get adequate sleep before taking tests. Adequate should be defined as at least eight hours of sleep a night. Some people may require more  as much as nine or ten hours.    Exercising to improve memory means primarily aerobic exercises: walking, biking, swimming, dancing, etc. These enhance your ability to remember by giving you more oxygen, and oxygen is the stuff that brain cells  as well as all your bodys cells  thrive upon. Good diet refers to eating foods high in antioxidants, getting plenty of dietary fiber, healthy sources of Omega-3 fatty acids, and making sure blood sugar remains stable.     To help kids at school, skip the cold cereal or pop tarts and consider serving protein instead. Eggs and toast for instance may improve not only memory, but also ability to concentrate in class. Yogurt smoothies made with soy or whey protein power can also give kids and adults that extra boost to keep their minds working at peak capacity.    Once youve got down the three basics, there are other things that may help improve memory. It can help to minimize distraction while working on tasks or studying. Low music to drown out background noise can be a help: think classical and not Aerosmith. Reducing stress levels is very important. When youre stressed out, you will not remember as much or as well. Many suggest meditation to both focus the mind and to reduce overall stress; prayer may work equally well.    When youre attempting to memorize things like phone numbers, math formulas and the like these can be most difficult. The best methods include attaching meaning to them. For instance a phone number might contain numbers that have a special meaning such as your birthdate, a special anniversary, or something similar, or they might have sequential numbers. Spend some time working on attaching meaning to the number in whatever ways work for you, and repeat the number verbally and write it down plenty of times to help you remember it.    Just about anything can be better remembered when it has attached meaning to it. If you have trouble with names, try to make up little rhymes about people youve met. Jot down a few notes on their physical description, or associate a name with someone youve known in the past. If you do happen to forget, ask again and keep trying to keep that name in focus.     Lastly, though your brain is not a muscle, it often works like one. You must keep using it, stretching it, and testing it to keep your memory sharp. Give yourself tests and challenges like memorizing short poems and bits of information. Keeping journals at night that catalog events of the day, can also help improve memory and keep your mental skills at their highest capacity.|`|g0Jd46Xxaa	READ.

5Qu1pfkraa	To gain weight you have to gain lots of muscle... cos gaining fat is gonna put you into trouble..    So eat frequent meals.. but not junk food    train with weights     Concentrate on compound movements    track your progress    set short term goals and reach it    Lot more of such strategies and details have been explained here - http://biglee-murali.blogspot.com/2008/0...      cheers,  http://biglee-murali.blogspot.com|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight is a two step process. I'm assuming that you want to gain the good kind of weight - muscle, not fat in which case you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|a866601a94a7a1716764f0de1f5f846caa	Hit the weights, eat 500 calories per day more than you need, aim for a 40/40/20 macro ratio.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Well think of it this way do you want to lose 20 pounds over the course of 2-3 months or do you want to keep gaining weight for the rest of your life?

I know no one likes to hear it, but the reason that answer is so common is because it's true.    What you can do is try to count calories. The least amount of calories an adult female should ingest is 1200 calories before you're depriving your body too much. If you keep track of the fat and caloric intake of what you eat and exercise for at least 20 minutes daily (brisk walk, etc.) you should see fast results.    You can keep track of your caloric intake and activities on fitday.com and it will help you keep track of your weight loss goal as well.

Do cardio half hour 5 days a week, and weights half hour five days a week, alternating between arms/ shoulders, thighs, calves, back/ abdomen...      Never eat carbs after 8 pm. For dinner, eat meat and only something very low i carbs- like green beans. The rest of the day you can have carbs. I f you do eat a dessert or sweet, have it at breakfast time. You are alllowed to eat carbs during the day, just not at night. Grill your chicken, or make tuna salad, etc.   Keep an exercise and food journal, and vary up your exercise and food so as to not get bored. Have special work out clothes, workout music, even chewing gum- like peppermint handy. It is good especially if you can join a gym ( at least this is what I had done). You should see results within 3 weeks, and if you keep going till the 7th week, you should have lost enough (about 7 pounds for me)so that you will be motivated to keep up with it after that.  It is good to have a good friend who also is doing the same program as you are, or at least someone you can chat with about it all.   And also, purchase the soy protein powder- I like the vanilla flavor- and add water (or a little milk, as i did), and ice cube, with one of those cup shakers... add 2 scoops of protein powder, and drink this after your workouts. The milk makes it more delicious, but some people only use water. Also, if yo u get hungry at night and already ate your dinner, have one of these shakes. Do not skip breakfast or lunch or dinner. You still need to eat regularly. But the exercising will tend to make you  more hungry, especially after you exercize. You can grill your chicken o one of those George Foreman grills..|`|hJuPsaSDaa	The pattern for losing those excess pounds is easy - consume less and workout more - the difficulties surface when we really try to put that into practice!

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If inserted correctly this wouldn't happen - why would women use IUD's if this could happen? It would make them pretty useless if they caused problems during sex. I've had a IUD for 7 years now and nothing like that has happened to me or anyone else I know with a IUD.     The only things that can cause the IUD to move is tampons if used incorrectly as the dry tampon can pull on the IUD strings (e.g. worn at night or when not menstruating), softcups or diaphragms as they sit next to the cervix so the IUD string can be pulled on removal, and menstrual cups which can catch the string of the IUD too - all of these things would cause the IUD to come down or come out but this is very rare. For a IUD to go up into the vagina and get lost is very very rare indeed.|`|AA12149303	I would think the doctor that implants it would put it far enough in there so that it wouldn't be able to be moved by tampons or sex penetration.

I am so tired of doctors that brush me off, saying there's nothing more we can do for you Mr .......... All I want at this point is some compassion. I don't think that's too much to ask. I'm fighting for my life as is your wife. We need support not pity or "you did it to yourself" crap.  Ok, I got that off my chest. Now, the greenish phlegm is a sign of infection and requires not only antibiotics but intensive therapy to keep her lungs clear and the airways as open as possible. COPD prevents proper drainage of secretions  so she needs to keep well hydrated and  purposely cough every couple of hours lying in bed.  Next time your at the hospital have a Respiratory Therapist show you how to do "cupping". Her breathing treatments are more important than ever right now. Keep her on schedule with them.  After each treatment is a good time to go to bed and try to cough. The idea behind lying down is to get a gravity assist.  There is no expiration date on your wife's foot. So don't give up.

First of all, do NOT mention anything about attention seeking as this will only make matters worse. The reasons why the person in question in doing this will soon come to light, but regardless of these, they need help. Try and provoke a conversation which causes the person to explain their actions rather than telling them to stop feeling this way. Encourage them to talk to someone who is qualified to deal with the matter such as the samaritans or childline.

I would recommend seeing a doctor.|`|2Iuw43j0aa	Your problem does not sound like an ear wax issue. If you feel pressure this usually comes from the middle ear which is actually connected with your throat via a small tube If this tube becomes inflamed ie. sore throat  or anything related  this tube allows for equalization with the outside.If you have ever flown you know how this works when you chew gum. But I would see a Dr. and get a referred to an Eye, ears nose and throat  specialist if this problem continues.  Oh an never stick anything in your ear leave that to the Dr. Ear wax is there to protect and falls out naturally|`|iximWxUraa	I have used ear candling on my son and it had no effect whatsoever. The matter at the end of the candle is the melted wax and burnt paper which the candle is made of...it is not ear wax. I do not recommend using them...if done incorrectly they can cause serious damage.    Also as to the comment that the ear and sinuses are not connected...I beg to disagree...    A cold, allergies, coughing, and sneezing can all be an influence in sinusitis. However, the fact that these can be an influence in ear infection is not commonly known. The reason that sinusitis and ear infection are related is that the sinuses and the ear are connected by a tube in the inner ear called the Eustachian tube.     ~~    If you have ever used a neti pot to clean out sinuses they recommend you not to use it if you have ear problems because this can make them worse.|`|AA12373166	Well they say it is wax maybe it might work|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	They can but must be done by an expert otherwise you can damage your ear,|`|mOayTJDmaa	It's not a good idea to light your ear wax.|`|xzJGhhN0aa	They drain earwax but if youre in pain you need to go to a dr.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I would guess it could be a seasonal thing, but if it bothered me I would see an ENT who can let you know if you have an infection. I do not recommend ear candles unless they are used by a qualified person.|`|pMzq6B3paa	They can, but there are other things you can do like use a hair drier on low or med setting and hold it to your ear so that the hot air is blowing in your ear, hold it for a few minutes, that works for me, also if you don't have a hair dryer, use a newspaper or a large paper roll it into a cone shape and stick the small end in your ear, but not all the way in, then with a match or lighter light the other end on fire, the hot air will get in your ear and drain out any water or air in your ear, but have someone help you so you don't set your hair or something else on fire.... Both of these work good.|`|N5MjOIXsaa	yes, but they are not ear candles, it's like a cone, you can get them at any health food store.|`|sfNZJEwUaa	No,No!  You should get help for that.|`|cOqFa7RAaa	i think so cuz my my family has used ear candles and its helped out a lot in the past
q0nhx3veaa	I was a victim of rape when I was about 14.    It was by my ex boyfriend. It was so embarssing to look at my family. My family found out the day it happened because his parents came over saying I made it all up and that I "just said he did because I was jealous of his gf"??? or something stupid like that. I dont think I would have told my family for a while so I'm glad they did it for me.    I'm 18 now. My family knows it happened and specially me and my sister hate him. He still lives in this town and I know where he lives because he's now a big time sex offender of alot of other poor girls.     It was a terrible thing to go through but I think it made me a stronger person. I don't regret it. I dont regret anything in my life. I like what my life has played into now and I've always been afriad if I changed just one thing, I wouldn't be with an amazing fiancee and have such an amazing life.    =]|`|GtJYDEayaa	I woke up with a guy (that I actually liked at the time) fingering me once. I acted like I was just waking up, went into the kitchen, grabbed a knife, and went back into the room and woke/told my friends. He said he didn't do anything, but he acted like a complete liar. So he tells me that I can 'hurt him' if I want, to 'prove' that he didn't do anything. He didn't think I'd do it. I sliced open his hand so deep that I'd be surprised if he ever got feeling back in them.    I was pretty freaked for a long time afterward. My friends just thought I'd 'hallucinated it'. It wasn't until a friend overheard him saying that I'd been 'asking for it' that they found out the truth.    I feel fine now. He got his due, I'm happy. The worst part of it for me was my friends believing him.     No, he didn't know I liked him, and I wasn't even single. In fact, my boyfriend was asleep in the same room.

That Pringles.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Hide, why waste everyone's time reading dumb, sarcastic answers from you?    I had shingles when I was 21 and my mom had it when she was 72, It's a pretty common virus, from the chicken pox virus. There's not much treatment for it, but time. It can be extremely painful, as mine was. I was pregnant and it was around my ribcage, right where my bra rubs. It went away on its own a couple weeks later.    Oh yeah Dumpling, forgot about the zovirax. Back in the day when I had it, there was no zovirax.
PVMsr2Faaa	So THAT"S why they use those little flash lights, to see the fog.  I have learned something, thanks.|`|6mSfRjpxaa	It sounds like your son has an ear infection. When there is fluid in the inner ear the eardrum may appear cloudy. Your son may be diagnosed with otitis media,which is an infection or inflammation of the middle ear. This inflammation often begins when infections that cause sore throats, colds, or other respiratory or breathing problems spread to the middle ear. These can be viral or bacterial infections. Seventy-five percent of children experience at least one episode of otitis media by their third birthday. Almost half of these children will have three or more ear infections during their first 3 years. It is estimated that medical costs

3sriJtSkaa	If someone claims your disease is fake, of course it will feel insulting.   However, there heave been years of conflicting reports as to the validity of the disease. Many people claim that it is psychological or that the pain and disabilities are a physical manifestiation of depression. The theories go on and on but the fact remains that there is no conclusive test for fibromyalgia, there is no way to confirm that you do have the diesase and in all honesty there is no 100% conclusive evidence that I have ever seen that the condition even exists. Whoever said the fibro is a "fake" probably would be able to get many physicians to back them up, but the idea that doctors can't put their finger on exactly what is wrong or why doesn't make your pain or problems any less valid.   If whoever said this to you was a medical professional, you can certainly report them to a superior. If it was just on these message boards, then I'd just ignore it.   good luck.|`|0rpN2419aa	Yes, it is definetly wrong!  Your pain is very real.  I have Addison's disease and multiple gastrointestinal disorders.  Some days I have pain, and some days I feel quite well.  Having an invisible illness makes it very difficult to explain why we don't feel up to doing things other people feel we should do.  I am really sorry you have to go through this.  I am older, I know, but I have had health issues for many years.  When someone insults you about your condition, hit the report abuse button as it is abuse.    Best wishes for better feeliing days ahead.|`|qr7LdskQaa	I feel it's insulting. I have had multiple diagnoses for Fibromyalgia, 10+. However, it is NOT in our heads, were not making it up. It's a real disease and it's there. I have all kinds of problems because of it. I have the balance, motor planning, every day functioning problems mentioned in the above question and the wreak havoc with me constantly.     We who have Fibromyalgia are sick. Please stop insulting us and making us feel like what we have isn't real. it most certainly is, I live with it every single day The people making these claims that Fibromyalgia isn't real are people who do not have it. They have no idea what it's like to suffer with the constant pain and everything associated with this disease.|`|Xu4zdMhbaa	If it is not real then I would like to know what my mother has suffered from for the past 15 years.  Yes it is insulting.  It took my mother several years to get a diagnosis and since then she has been able to manage the best she can.  To any that say it does not exist, you should stay a month with someone who has a severe case of it and then come back and say it is a fake illness.  If you do then I will punch you in the mouth and you will be lucky if I stop there.
wAavEm30aa	This has happened to me! i hate bumps so i automatically pick at them. First you need to leave it alone. Dont pick it, scratch it, any of that. Put some antibiotic on it.

nhLvrVx9aa	you shouldn't have to do anything to get an erection.  It should go up by itself.    Can you get an erection with a guy around? Maybe your more on the gay side then the Bi side.  Not judging you at all, If I knew you I'd love you either way. Makes no difference to me.    Or, this is what I think. Your scared around girls. Why, because it will be your first time, and your nervous. With guys...hell you have been around them your whole life. With being naked around a girl it's a little different.  If you do go that far with a girl, be open and honest. They don't bite. She might nibble a little but that's all ha ha!!  Just explain, its your 1st time, your nervous, and it might take a little foreplay to get you going.  She will understand.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Can  you get an erection with guys?

I took dance my whole life and when I was your age I thought I was over weight because of the numbers on the scale too. Don't pay attention to those, muscle weighs more than fat. (a lot more)     Just say healthy with your eating habits. Eat a lot of veggies, lots of omega 3 fatty acids which are in fish, nuts, legumes, seeds etc... eat lean protein ex :chicken and fish and keep a daily or three day a week work out routine and you should be fine.

Both of these supplements are for digestion and elimination and should be taken with care.  The body will metabolize them at different rates and treat them differently.  If the Parotid is a PMG (protomorphogen) extract then it will more than likely be absorbed quickly and effectively anyways.

OfthWRsDaa	They don't actually deliver all the food - you have to buy all your own fruits, veggies and dairy - basically all the real fresh food, they don't provide. So it's 12$/day PLUS all the other stuff (which is what you really want to be eating, fruits and veggies) So it's about 360$ PLUS your groceries, and you will have to go grocery shopping. Eat small fresh healthy meals and exercise. Either way, you should try to go grocery shopping, saves money and your waistline.|`|YQk8zW6caa	it works, if you follow it and exsersize.  but the portions are very small and not worth it, your only paying abotu 12$ aday cause they give you like 0 food, on the commercals look and them holding the small plate of food, yuo cannot get full off that. try jenny craig if you want food deliverd they havea new program wher you can eat healthy big meals and loose weight. good luck  but personally i say go for a 20 min run everyday and eat well.  running is cardio and cardio burns fat.|`|b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	Yes if you can afford it go for it.    But really if you just stopped eating out, you'd lose weight (and save $).      Those commercials always annoy me. Have you seen the one where that lady said she was known as the plump one?

gaDu2GUraa	Yes.  I had that too and got mine fixed and it made a world of difference on the way I could breath.    professor|`|4onT0qUxaa	Sure, a deviated septum is just a fancy term for a crooked nose, lol. It can cause a number of problems with breathing, sinuses, etc.|`|AA12358000	NozDontKnowMyNamz,  When your septum is significantly off-center, you have a deviated septum. Resulting signs and symptoms may include difficulty breathing, nasal congestion, nosebleeds and frequent sinus infections and mild to severe headaches. Initial treatment of a deviated septum may include medications to manage signs and symptoms. But to correct a deviated septum, it is necessary to undergo surgery. If you have an infection of the sinus(es) or any type of respiratory tract  infection, it is possible for the ear(s) to become infected from this source. To ascertain if the "popping" in your ears is caused by excess wax, infection or any other cause, you would be advised to have your ears examined visually, by a qualified medical person, with an auroscope.

They cost about $30 at Wal-Mart. You should use the entire box for best results. Also, you can go through the box in half the time by using the strips twice a day - once in the morning, once at night. They kind of taste funny, but once you get used to them, they aren't that bad.    These seem to be a bit gentler then the more expensive one-time hour kits you can buy and the effects last longer.

From a family member of mines past expierences they will try to make what you have as meaningless as possible even if you are really sick.|`|4onT0qUxaa	It is routine for them to send you to both a medical doctor and a shrink when you apply. It would benefit your case to take your previous records with you to these visits, although you may have trouble getting them to actually look at them. These Dr's will typically deny that you have any verifiable conditions, but the records from your previous Dr's and specialist will help prove your case, especially if there are clinical tests to back it up. It is also routine for them to request the records from all of your Dr's, although they may not receive them in time to evaluate your case. Your best bet- make sure that everyone involved in making a decision in your case is in receipt of your records as soon as possible. You have to be proactive about it. Don't rely on your case worker to get the information from your Dr. Ask if you can fax or mail the documents yourself, and once you have, call them to make sure they were received and are in your file for review before the evaluation of your claim is made. As long as there is good documentation, and the ailment is on SSI's list of approved conditions, they should approve it. Keep in mind that it must be a condition that keeps you from doing ANY type of work in order for you to get approved.
1ciXpUfcaa	RUN while you still can!! RUN!|`|tAMkjOjSaa	Geez...............she annoys me to...find another girl or have her move in with u|`|x3EPqezJaa	Sounds passive-aggressive and controlling. By deliberately being late, she controls the events and people's lives. She makes herself the center of attention, which could mean she has narcissistic tendencies.    She also sounds hostile in general.     These things have nothing to do with schizophrenia or bi-polar disorders.|`|HFKr2vBsaa	Ok, I'm confused.. first you say it's your g/f's mother and then you say your g/f is always late for school. Is her mom making her late?    If it's her mom, then it does sound like she's depressed, bored, or just spacey. Also, depending on her age, it could be pms or postmenopausal. Or it could just be that she's always been late and has no idea of time management, lots of people are that way especially if they've never had to work in a job or be in a position where their livelihood hinged on being on time.    If you don't like being around her, then you and your g/f need to hang out someplace else.|`|CBNC40sDaa	Sounds like she is passive-aggressive.

But what it boils down to is contempt for other people's time. It can be a control issue. It's also very passive-aggressive, and can be very manipulative. Anyone can be late; it can't be helped sometimes.       It's very annoying and disrespectful. The only thing to do is to stop relying on her to do anything. If your gf is counting on her to get to school then it is downright neglectful. This woman needs help; but getting her to realize that could be a major project.|`|uDlRadwEaa	she duznt trust or like u very much|`|ZXN5Thb4aa	I'm not a professional psychologist, but she sounds like a depressed, unhappy procrastinator who doesn't like to go to school.  She isn't happy and doesn't want anyone else to be, either.|`|AA10593256	It is hard to say just by your discussion of the person but I think some of her behavior is attention seeking and also shows some signs of depression.  Her lateness could be avoidance because she doesn't really want to participate in these activities or she could be seeking attention in that being late causes some focus to be on her.  If her family has a history of mental health problems it is not unlikely she could also be suffering from some issues as well.  Ask her to seek a mental health evaluation.  If she refuses, you may want to limit your contact with her.      (To combat the lateness just tell her to be ready at half-hour earlier than she needs to be)

F9KBwSQ4aa	try five days a week see if its a difference.|`|AA11447210	Add some strength training to you workout, add another day a week (or 2) if you can. Part of your lack of weight loss may be that you are toning your mucles with the cardio, and although cardio is good for fat burning your body gets used to it quickly. If you do exercises to build muscle (you can't bulk up, so don't worry) then you'll be adding to your strength, increasing your metabolism, and adding dense tissue that takes up less space than fat even though it weighs more.    Don't get too discouraged. I've been on P90X for nearly a month now, eating really well, and I've dropped about 4 lbs when I expected much more since it's a very intense program.     The results will come...have patience! (and mix things up, varying workouts and intensities...don't do the same thing every workout)|`|1aybJTCBaa	mmm, are you counting calories.

If not, and you don't eat after that time (which you shouldn't), then it just takes time!  Don't worry about it. If you were unfit before, or you never excerised, then you just gotta wait.  Surely, you've lost a bit.    Hope I helped, for a best answer :)|`|szeGGyZXaa	Even tho your doing mostly cardio and eating correctly your in the gym working most of your muscles. Your exceeding your heart rate for your work out and this works out your muscle. So your actually fit and your not losing much weight because your muscles are heavier then fat. Continue to do your cardio but ask your gym constructor to check your heart rate around how much fat is in your body and work around that number. This will cause you to sweat and lose weight a lot faster and effectively. You should easily lose 10 to 20 pounds depending on how vigorous your work outs are. All this weight lost will be water so its very healthy and results are great looking.     Good luck     No source but I been body building for about 5 years now|`|xfpJGBfwaa	I don't think you're doing anything wrong.  Your body is adjusting to the new weight loss of 5 lbs.  And it's being sluggish about it.     If you want to get it moving again, you need a new strategy, that's all.  There's millions of things to try.      My current favorite is Kellog's Water (K20) which helps you avoid snacking by providing a tiny bit of protein in a Lemonade or Ice Tea flavored drink you can sip for hours.      You can replace a meal with a protein shake a few times a week.  Either off the shelf like Boost, Ensure, or SlimFast, or make your own by visiting the Health Food store, and find one you like (but then buy one of those shaker cups designed for mixing them up).      Are you taking a multivitamin/multimineral with the RDA of calcium? Calcium helps you lose weight.    Are you getting enough rest?  Maybe swap out an aerobics class for a yoga class or find a meditation center nearby to the gym.  Stressed out grumpy people don't often lose weight. (You don't sound grumpy, but maybe a little stressed out.)    Oh, I like j.whoa1's idea too.. not to get too technical but why not go beyond your lactate threshold?  A little bodybuilding, sprinting, and "high intensity" things could really help in this situation.  Just watch out for overtraining which can give you major fatigue.  Get lots of rest.  It's a good plan to get a coach if you're going to go this route.  They have the experience to help you out when you hit walls.|`|NK0JNPyHaa	It depends on a lot of factors. What are you eating? How many calories are you eating per day? You may still be eating too many, or you may be eating too few. If your body has insulin issues, perhaps make sure you're not eating refined sugars. Don't drink your calories, either. Also, how intense is the cardio? Are you mixing it up?     Try this:  1.) Talk to a gym nutritionist or visit a reputable website on the internet to do the formula to figure out how many calories you need per day. Subtract 300 calories from that for each day to see gradual, sustainable weight loss.  2.) Drink lots of water, and get all 8 hours of sleep per night. Dehydration makes your body retain water and makes your body less efficient; sleep deprivation impacts our body's cortisol release and makes us crave sugar.  3.) Mix up your cardio. Do different things: walking, jogging, swimming, aerobics classes, using the bike. Mix and match. Make sure you're sweating and throw in a minute here and there of REALLY intense exercise.  4.) Add some light strength training.  5.) Make sure your nutrition is coming from the right places. Don't eliminate whole food groups or deprive yourself. If you're on a 1,600 calorie per day plan, save 200 to indulge. If you know nighttime snacking is a problem, chew sugar free gum from 7pm on until you brush your teeth.     Good luck!
BRh1uAMNaa	I had mine done, and it was easy.  They spray your throat to numb your gag reflex.  And they give you good drugs.  You'll be awake, but you won't remember much.  The only thing I really remember is when they filled my stomach up with a puff of air.  Really, the hardest part was not being able to eat.  And in the holding area before, they gave me all these food magazines to read.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|epmFn113aa	don't worry about the POUNDS, just try staying away from sweets and high saturated fat and NIX the salt it can make you retain water, DRINK alot of water and honeslty i have to say it, "try to exercise", not like Boot camp style just walking or dancing, you'll tone up and slim down at a healthy pace.

G9sd4Nlkaa	I am seventeen and am depressed as well. You will hear this from a lot of other people, but depression is not something that is easily solved. The best thing that you can do is to see a doctor, even if you don't want to. If you have no way of getting to the doctor, then you have to talk to someone. Talk to the counselor at school and just talk about what makes you upset. I start crying over nothing at all. I could look at a chair and burst into tears, but simply crying and getting it over with usually makes me feel better. I recently just told my parents about how I'm feeling all the time and I, myself, am going to see a counselor twice every week. It definitely feels better and they haven't shoved any drugs down my throat... yet, but just knowing that there are people out there that want to help is reassuring and very comforting.     Some people might wave this off as teenage hormones, but how do they know? Right? It could be that you are still a teenager and are having a hard time, but there is the chance that you could be depressed, if not completely then you're at the beginning stages. Stress can lead to depression, so maybe you should slow things down in your life. Don't take on too many obstacles at a time and maybe some days, just take some time out of your day to just think. Relax and mull things over.    You can't just make depression go away by saying that it will. If what you have really is depression, then your only real chance at a semi-happy life (because it's difficult to have a prefectly happy life even when you are on medication) is to see a doctor or a counselor. Don't see a shrink or a psychiatrist, because they will only want to shove a bunch of different pills down your throat. And in a situation like this, that's not always the best way to go.     I can't say that I know exactly what your going through, because every case of depression is different, but I can say that I feel the same sort of hurt and lonliness that you feel.     I hope I helped and I really hope that you do the right thing and go see a doctor.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	I'm not sure you should be calling it depression, what you're experiencing seems to be a lot like adolescence.  It sucks!  I wish someone had told me how bad it was and how long it would last.  I had a million thoughts running through my head at once, and twice that many emotions.        Here's my advice:       -Everybody your age is going through it, so don't feel alone.       - It won't be cured with medication or drugs...so try to keep clear of those (exercise might do wonders...give it a try).            When I was about 22 years old, it ended.  All of the sudden my head was clear, things seemed to slow down, and everything improved.  I know 22 seems like it's forever away, but it may not be that long for you.  Just remember that if you can find one person to confide in, it will make you feel a lot better.       Don't worry, things get better.|`|AA12388728	hi i have ocd and bipolor i also cry about money what if there an left and no one likes me i cry my neighrs drive me crazy they all know to leave me alnoe but no they don't your not alone kweep your chin up god bleass|`|RsXcfDIXaa	Have you been diagnosed with depression.

cd678b2fa349bebde48b1bbc3017c9f9aa	There are two tests for herpes. One is a blood test and will show if you have the anti-bodies that show you are fighting the virus and therefore have it. The other is a swab test where they scrape some cells from a sore area that is suspected to be herpes. If you have the virus but are not having an outbreak or about to have one it will not show up in the blood test and there will be no cells to test so someon can have it and the test will not pick it up. One in 5 adults has the virus. Many have it without knowing and can pass it on without ever have symptoms themselves. Others may have it and find that their partner never catches it - they may have a good immune system or be immune due to having had a cold sore previously. People that do have outbreaks may only get one in their life. Usually it flares up during times of tiredness and stress. At the end of the day, it's just a cold sore in a different place. It's not very pleasant but not the end of the world and will not do any fertility damage.  I hope this helps. Don't worry. There are some amazing support groups around. Try www.hype.com.   x

Yes, virginity is a great asset. Marry only a virgin girl. A girl is called a virgin who never had sexual intercourse & not whether she had her hymen intact or not. A girl who already has lost her virginity cannot love her husband as deeply as a virgin girl b coz for her having sexual intercourse with her husband first time too is an ordinary exercise she already has done earlier for pleasure sake like an animal, free from great extraordinary emotion, attraction, excitement, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest & craze at the moment  of practically becoming a wife with dignity. That a prostitute too does commonly, it is simple thing to understand. There is no method or test by which you can know whether she lost her virginity earlier or not. Believe her if she says she is. Human beings only believe human beings. All are not unreliable, most of them are. In present modern atmosphere too more number of girls maintain their virginity than boys till marriage, it is reality. In the very first sexual intercourse, a girl's vagina is tight. A virgin girl can not guide her husband how to do at her very first experience. If husband asks how to do, she is clueless. Anyone can think oneself to be smart by telling a lie by hiding so many things but nature's arrangement is such that one cannot do every time. If there is something serious happened in the past, while sleeping together on the same bed, during sleeping or half sleepy conditions, past happenings come out of the mouth & the spouse comes to know  that. Many times it gets automatically narrated. While sleeping one cannot control oneself by suppressing one's own this natural thing. Most of boys & girls don't know this fact.  Girls are much more emotional than boys. So, handle your would be wife with care & delicacy. Don't go berserk on small things shattering her cherished dream of having deep loving happy life providing pleasure of heaven while loving together. Before marrying learn enough on 'Google search' on the topic 'Sex Techniques'  & 'orgasm'.|`|MN5jKAFZaa	Ok. First of all you can ask her. Secondly there is no sure fire way to tell if she is a virgin. If she has her hymen still then she is a virgin. The hymen will pop when you have sex and that usually means a small amount of blood. If you are getting married you are most likely at least 18. This means that even if she is a virgin she might not have her hymen. Women's hymens can break due to bike riding, tampon use, exercise, and just getting older. So I would just ask her.|`|WhraUAUbaa	Go get her,.......|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	Without a good faith you should not go for marry.  Otherwise ,who knows you may go for another try .|`|RwY2Eu7Raa	There is a covering in the female vagina called "Hymen".  Usually, it is presumed by our elders that this hymen has to break during sexual intercourse and this considered as a "token" for virginity.  But, these days girls are engaged in every type of work and there is a chance to for the hymen to get torn. Hence, trust is the biggest thing you can adopt, and carry on.  Look at her plus points and appreciate her.  Adopt a give and take policy.  Best of luck.

Those kind of exercises   Eat healthier and eat less|`|23bs0kAKaa	Ok, Firstly how much do you weight and how tall are you.    To do this the safe and healthy way, you are gona lose only about 2-3 pounds a week.     First off, start exercising at least 4-5 times a week, jogging and sit ups are good, jumping jacks are also great. Any physical exertion will be hard at first, when it starts getting easier for the same thing, its working, and then when its not to tough, make it harder again (eg. more jumping jacks, or sittups, run farther, OH skipping is also REALLY good, but some boys dont like to do it, i found it fun and im a guy)    Next is your diet, Fast food, chips, soda pop, candy, sugar, all has to go, Eat whole wheat instead of white bread, white bread is all sugar, and it taste the same!!! Lots of salads, just learn to like them, I used to hate salad now i eat a Caesar salad almost every day!! They are really good.     now if you find yourself needing a snack, Go get an orange or banana rather than something thats fatty or bad for you.     Next is what time in the day you eat! VERY IMPORTANT, eat in the morning and after noon, and less at night, DONT EAT AFTER ... hmmm lets say 7:00PM! ANYTHING (unless you really cant help it, then eat very light and healthy, low calories) If you eat in the morning lots of food, you will burn it all off during the day and it wont turn to fatty stores, just by moving around and being awake, if you eat late night snacks, then your body doesnt burn off nearly enough of the calories and it will all turn to fat!!     Good Luck man. If you need more help or advice e-mail my hotmail account zevman10@hotmail.com|`|qBzvCetIaa	You should know this already. Exercise and diet. Though maybe diet isn't the word, just reduction in the food you eat. if you eat 3000 calories today, you might want to reduce it to 2500 and burn around a 1000 thru activity.|`|sxRPXvVnaa	Just say this to yourself every day:  "Eat less. Exercise more."  Don't forget to actually do that too.  A little every day of eating less and exercising more and after a few weeks you will see the difference.|`|epmFn113aa	oh the drama of being a 13 year old "chubby" girl. I was there and believe me the first thing you need to do is lose the so called friend for making fun of you, or at least talk to her and tell her that it hurts you. You need positive motivation especially from siblings and friends, IGNORE your sister, she's insecure herself and it makes her feel better to make fun of someone else, its always easier to make fun of siblings. Your body is going through alot of changes, its totally normal to have a little pudge. But a few tips that worked for me, stay active, exercise a little everday, dancing in your room counts!! DRINK WATER Nix the juice and sodas, even diet, WATER WATER WATER and  green tea sugar free or make your own with tea bags. Dont eat fast food and stop snacking on sweets especially at night. DONT starve yourself it wont work. eat tons of veggies and fruit, NO CREAMY dressings for salad stick to lowfat or fatfree. Remeber its okay to give in once in awhile, just remeber portion control. Have one slice of pizza with a salad, not 3 slices and fries....youll be fine. And find a tankini that works for you buy a womens one at a department store, not at a juniors store like forever 21 or 5-7-9(they make everyone feel fat), with boy shorts, it will flatter you and make you feel comfortable. DONT let anyone call you fat! They are a bunch of unhappy people.
589d02f1ccd24754ffae8cbfb5b69403aa	Hi. my therapist is really important to me. i've been seeing for about a year. i love my therapy sessions with her. she is so friendly and caring and understanding. when i leave after each session it feels like i am taking a breath of air for the first time. she's been helping me work through all the hurt and trauma in my life. i've gone from being suicidal to now having plans for my future thanks to her help. i've such a good therapeutic relationship with her. i can be talking to her and i'll burst into tears and i'll take a tissue and she'll ask me if i want some water. working with her has changed my life completely. i don't think i'd be here today if it wasn't for her.  my appointment with her today though has changed everything. i had this really emotional session where i was crying my eyes out for the whole session, barely able to speak. but towards the end i felt much better. i was going to get ready to go and was about to book next week's appointment with her but she had some news. she's pregnant and is leaving in a couple of months. so i've to see a new therapist when she's gone. i am upset, scared, nervous, worried. but hopefully it will be ok.|`|tVF9O1Olaa	I have been seeing my key worker for a year and get on so well with her but now she has decided to end our session although i am not sure why. I am no where near better and have been told i have BPD so how is ending all support helpful for me? They haven't even offered me any other support. I am a bit lost right now!|`|QjoWA99Yaa	Very much so. I have seen her for about a year and she knows more about me than anyone - that is special to me because I usually have so much trouble explaining myself. The fact I have managed to explain everything to her over the past twelve months makes me feel so relieved and less trapped. If she left of they changed her, I'd be devastated and actually quite scared.  And to the horribly ignorant person who answered first, more fool you - you seem more screwed up than any of us. :)|`|1ciXpUfcaa	I think my therapist is a little too important to me. I absolutely love her and would just die if she were to stop seeing me. What about you?|`|wOsJ1QEYaa	i've been seeing both  of them ( i have one of each) sice the beigning of september and the aren't that important to me my therapist is a twit she tells me one thing one week then the complete oposite the next week. so i can live with an other one    help me...  first question in "asked" column|`|AA11678263	I had a counsellor for a year.  She was amazing, and I would have been very upset if she was replaced, as she had great insight, and worked very well with me.  However, I wasn't attached to her personally, and ended sessions without difficulty.  I think it can be dangerous for people to become dependent on their counsellor/therapist as they will not be there forever.  A good therapist/counsellor will equip the individual to stand on their own two feet when sessions are over, as best as possible.|`|SsXNL74Aaa	i need my theripist on all costs ,,,, i would completely freak out if she abandoned me .... oh im borderline p.d|`|ai33g11Maa	I don't have a counsellor or a therapist.  I solve my own problems.|`|AA11401156	The one I have now just rides me off. Had this one for 20 months.  I had a counselor that helped really helped me.Had that one for 2 years.  He left and got a job that paid more.  Oh well.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	My therapist is very important to me. I might not be answering this post if it weren't for her. I've been seeing her for a little over two years.      I would care very much if she were unable to see me, but she has her life to live. There would probably be someone else, but it wouldn't be the same.|`|UiA10Ml3aa	i had a therapist since 2005, and they recently changed her. i trusted her a lot and i felt comfortable talking to her, every time im with my new therapist i think to my self damn i miss so and so, but at least the one i have now is not so bad, i am beginning to open up to her
AA11665011	If you are so fearful of being a mommy and daddy, STOP HAVING SEX!|`|0UpFkX5oaa	Yes, stress can have a very big part on that regard.  Give it a week. If she still doesn't get her period, try the test again.|`|kFECmFGLaa	I know its hard not to worry, but it will only delay her period. Im sure your fine, give it a couple days and take another test.|`|XB8ErFGdaa	Sure your sickooo i men what kinda guy actually remember's  when they had SEX!?!    Im soo sorry, but itss sooooo true. hahahahahaha    anyways to answer your question : it is because of that.  & if your safe it doesn't mean NOTHING can happen.  It just means that theirs a possibility that nothing will happen.     (:|`|AA10264002	stress definitely causes it to come late or early. if i were her i would get on the pill so you don't have to freak out everytime you have sex. its good that you use condoms but they are not 100% protection.|`|FCcbgriuaa	I think you shouldn't worry to much it could be stress. Wait until Feb. 10th and if it doesn't come then have her test again.|`|AA11448061	Worry and stress can cause periods to come late.  Worrying and stressing about it probably won't help.  I was stressed out like through Nov - Jan pretty bad and I skipped november and started late december and later in Jan.  So it could be because of stress.  I would encourage her to get on birth control, I have known people who have used condoms and still got pregnant because it busted or something.  But at least birth control would be extra backup.  But its probably stress thats causing her period to come late.|`|Ce5Ql9zTaa	Worry and stress can sure cause a late period.  Give it time.    sticks|`|t043WEDIaa	yes, stress has a large impact on a girl's menstrual cycle.  it is normal to even skip a month. also watch her exercise habits, and if she's hanging out with anyone new who she might start cycling with.|`|ySBr6QcVaa	well you never know. her period might just be a little late--not a problem. just chill and have funn :)|`|8pLDp9rOaa	I think you're worrying over nothing. The cramping is most likely her period on it's way and it's only the 29th today so technically she's not late.    Give it a few days, I'm sure it'll come!    If your GF is worrying alot, that will more than likely delay her period. If the test said negative then more than likely she's not preg. She just needs to try and relax. She'll get her period when she least expects it lol.    Good luck|`|o0GPDE4Maa	Stress def slows down the process, me and  my gf do the same thing. We always worry about, what if it doesn't come this month, could she be pregnant. But as soon as we get a test for her, she starts cramping, and a few days later bam. so just don't get so worked up about it, relax. It'll be ok..  =)|`|1mqiaTnRaa	stress can definitely cause periods to become late or even early. id the test was negative, then shes not pregnant. there is a test called, first responce, which can tell you up to five days before her missed period. she just needs to relax. only time can tell. the only 100% way to not get pregnant is not having sex.|`|oumS9VbUaa	been there so many times!  just a few days ago actually... except the condom broke... but i was supposed to get my period 3 days later so i decided to not get the morning after pill and just wait 4 my period.  Don't stress the stress makes it come later! take it from someone who has gone through that several times.  try not to think about it sometimes periods can come a week or more late because of stress, take another test in a few days just to be safe, and to have a good piece of mind! take your gf out to dinner and and do nice relaxing things for her run her a romantic bath go out of your way to keep her happy and stress free as much as possible because then if she isn't thinking about it so much it will come ! and her seeing you frantic and stressed will just be worse for her!
kX14PGRcaa	jen. first of all i didnt have to google this answer.  my boss just got out of the hospital. he had to have a foot of his intestine cut off because he took advil everytime he had a headache.  i mean right now you might not know it but later on in life it can eat at the lining of your stomach.  and a bit of info, advil is not aspirin, tylenol is aspirin.|`|QsCPOHAraa	Of course it's bad! You're putting chemicals into your body on a regular basis, and any time you do that it's bad. If you have these reoccurring headaches, it might be a sign of a problem that would require you to visit a doctor.    Painkillers do just that, kill the pain. They don't solve the problem.|`|gGYLOK1vaa	yea, if you take too many, exp on an empty stomach you can get an ulcer.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Firstly advil is not asprin. If you go through a 250 ct bottle in a month then you are taking like 8 a day and that is VERY bad. Go to the doc for and Rx if your headaches are that bad.
n7qcfWxkaa	A chiropractor could probably work wonders for you.|`|3SI1j74saa	see a neck doctor|`|XuxZPdNdaa	Chiropractor or good acupuntures... you need to un-knot those muscles... don't let it go on too long!|`|RBpVp7Q0aa	ive had that before...not fun...get someone to massage ur neck to take away any knots there first of all. then use a heating pad or those bags u fill with hot water and put it on ur neck. warmth helps take away the stiffness of the muscles. it might last a few days but u should be ok. my case was a little different...i couldnt move my neck at all :( just make sure u keep ur muscles warm because that wat the body automatically does anyways....dont put ice on it-itll make it even stiffer.
G3In5FrWaa	MOst of the time we are checking you out to see if we can have a physical attraction to you girls, also we do this so we can let you girls know that we think your cute and wanna get to know you a bit more or would like to break the ice bettween us....|`|ExrnMmtsaa	He probabaly thinks you are hot and is looking for a reassuring sign from you so he's not afraid of being rejected when he comes over to talk to you. If you want him to go away just do that "L" on your forhead thing with your fingers. He will get the idea and realize that you are a simple little bimbo and move on to greater and more intelligent pursuits. :)|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Well I'm in high school so when that happens the girl knows that means we will meet up later and have a two person party In my bed or back seat.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	That hes checking you out because of something.|`|osEdRAFLaa	haha.. i love that game.. they look at you.. and then you look at them when there not looking and then you guys meet eyes and its really awkward lolz.. it means he was checking you out and if you looked back he was proballly gonna go talk 2 u|`|E59SBBNuaa	it usually means we fancy them and want to get it on! lol

lpyIKYUXaa	Ego is where you think highly of yourself   'oh i am so beautiful, i get all the guys'  So a lack of it would being not confident enough, i guess :)|`|AA11945637	mellow|`|Ga11Abmzaa	It means that your to self centered.|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	Often could be a lack of self worth; in other words you need to value yourself more.|`|x3EPqezJaa	I guess it usually means that the person isn't overly proud or self-centered. They don't demand credit for achievements or attention or adulation.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	it could also mean you lack drive and motivation for life, to complete things, achieve ect doing stuff that makes you feel good and thus you feel like crap all the time.|`|b6rjAVFAaa	no confidence or believing in yourself
FvAl3UgQaa	I know you're not going to like this answer but you really do need to get bloods checked.     I'm currently under treatment for iron deficiency anaemia and in my case there's an obvious cause - but even though they've prescribed the most tolerated oral iron supplement (ferrous fumarate) I'm still getting unpleasant gastric side effects. I really wouldn't advise taking the level of iron that would be needed to correct a deficiency as severe as yours may be, when there are various other things that can cause the same outward symptoms.    Basically, if it is anaemia at all, it's pretty severe, going by your symptoms. Mine was only picked up during other tests, rather than effecting me noticeably, and yet it's supposedly quite severe, to the point that my doctor said that ordinary multivitamins with iron would make no difference (my new tablets contain 300mg iron (fumarate) whereas the combined multivitamins & iron I'd already purchased have 4mg!)|`|DZP8b9sXaa	I have an iron deficiency too.  You might want to go to a doctor to get blood work tested before you start taking any supplements.  You don't want to overload your body on something if you don't really need it.  My doctor just told me to take multivitamins and an iron tablet at least once a week.  I'm eighteen by the way, hope this helped :)|`|ydNj7YM6aa	It is a possibility to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and take on board that if you lose weight rapidly then you will probably put it all back on again just as rapidly. The only diet which clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it was featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off 25 pounds, it clearly does produce success!
YIKNamxqaa	interesting concept....no idea...I can see that though, I get pretty rammy if I haven't jizzed in a while.|`|xktBgoKFaa	No truth to this but they believe it anyway. It just makes them tense. Zinc, on the other hand, does increase testosterone.|`|iYNVJKgxaa	You get angry and inraged because you have been so fertile for so long and the take it out in the ring, so if you take it out by lifting weights then that could work!!!
YCXxP43Laa	It would be though out the month. I have PCOS, but my testosterone levels are not unduly high. What causes the hair growth and acne on women with this condition is not necessarily high testosterone levels, but lower oestrogen/progesterone levels, and a greater sensitivity to testosterone. Tou can minimise the effects by keeping your weight well within the correct levels.|`|tnEIPjccaa	It is usually a constant problem with pcos. If you find you are experiencing some of the more embarrassing symptoms, like lots of facial hair, speak to your doctor about a medication called aldactone. It won't completely get rid of the hair, but it will thin it, and reduce its growth significantly.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	Listen girl DON'T try to loose weight fast try to loose it sensibly this way it stays off.

Weight loss should be about 1 to 2 pounds a week. Any faster, and you risk quickly gaining it back. REMEMBER THAT!! Losing weight extremely fast causes people to gain it back very fast.  You need to do something that you can stick with for the rest of your life.  Eat lower in fat with more fruits and veggies. Exercise for a half an hour a day. Make sure whatever you do is something you can keep up with every day, forever.|`|k9nSyf3caa	when i was your age i weighed 160.  i quit eating meat.

XuxZPdNdaa	I've never tried zinc oxide, but vaseline works great!!!  just apply a generous amount, use your fingers to rub it, generally the chapped parts will rub off easily... than apply chapstick/vaseline for the next few days and watch it get all smooth again.    Not to mention, vaseline is readily available almost anywhere... supermarket, 99cent stores, thrifty marts, etc...|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I'm not too sure about Zinc Oxide...

1oBilGHuaa	I have had depression for many years.  I've also been in therapy and taking medications for many years.  I am doing the best I have ever done. The thing about depression is, if you wait until you feel better to do something, you are going to have a long wait.  Even though you don't feel like doing something it's important to do it anyway.  When it comes to cutting or picking at skin, I have found that if I keep the areas that I pick at covered, I am less likely to start picking.  I hope this helps.  I hope you will be feeling better soon.  Best Wishes.
AA11212382	I know what your going through.  My brother and mom were addicted to alot of things from heroin to Vikiden.  They didn't stop doing those things until they hit rock bottom.  For my brother it took him being single, homeless and jobless.  The whole family basically cut him off except for me and my mom.  We encouraged him to go to rehab.  He went and kept doing those things.  Then hhe went again.  They won't quit unless they want to or unless things get so bad that things cant get better without them quitting.  If they do not help try talking tothem about it.  I know that this can be hard.  But tell them that you are really worried.  Or prehaps talk to the doctor about it.  I don't know how old you are but it would probably be benefitial for you to take yourself out of the situation.  Best of luck!    Hope I helped :)|`|kB8JJoUVaa	i am addicted to pain meds right now and am trying to get off of them myself let me let you until the person is ready there isn't much you can do this isn't the first time i've tried either these are the worst things to try to get off ..just stand by them ..i know that's hard..but to know you have family or a friend in your corner means sometimes life or death..try to take them to AA or Na..God be with you..  i had to be EPC  but they did work with my doc to bring me down slowly..too bad i did not learn the first time|`|FUV1iWY7aa	My mother was addicted. It is so hard to deal with. But the worse thing is there is nothing you can do for them. They have to want to do it for themselves or not at least for those that love them. You just can't make anyone change. If you're having trouble dealing with their addiction try http://www.samaritans.org/ or take out Alateens.  If they are looking for help they should call a hotline. I also found this page pretty effective: http://ezinearticles.com/?Pain-Pill-Addi...

Then tell them what the loved one is doing.    (2) You may get online support with Nar-Anon:    http://nar-anon.org/index.htm        I hope this helps.  And may God bless you in your endeavor.|`|1b4c2ef06139746bf0c23a8101562dcfaa	Yes, speak to the doctor and tell him/her of your concern. You need not let the family member know you have spoken with their doctor.|`|X2cApvrcaa	until they are ready to acknowledge they have a problem and need help, there is nothing you can do.

I know insurance plays games with us, but I hope you can find a physician who will recommend you to a respiratory specialist/  Good luck and I think it's great that you get out and walk with your dog.  I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for you.  Hopefully, someone with the same conditon will come on.    Patti|`|f8mLpPXlaa	One thing doctors have to learn above all is that each person knows their normal and if something is nor "right". They should just listen and try to find what's wrong rathert than brush you of with, essentially, "you're not sick enough for me." Get another doctor.

The best soup to put it in taste wise is anything tomato based like vegetable soup.     Eat a bowl of soup with tabasco in it a few times a day and your throat will feel SO much better.

Make sure you do it the healthy way or those skin tight sexy jeans won't fit anymore! lol|`|Vhq3GURQaa	The best thing is to eat sensibly. I cannot stress enough the importance of water. The latest studies say to avoid artificial sweeteners because it tastes sweet and you continue to crave the sweet after you eat or drink it because you never get the sugar buzz.   Exercise to tighten the muscles. Ask a pro how to make sure you are doing the right kind to tighten and firm not build up . Good luck!|`|OilQvoLZaa	about 12 pounds|`|epmFn113aa	um thats really not big at all! and its not about the weight you can tone by exercising.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I'm 5'4 and 115 lbs and I still can't fit into a size 25!!  A small waist size doesn't always represent being thin, it has to do with your body frame.  You could eat ice cubes everyday and still might not be able to fit into a size 25.

Some doctors will and some won't.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Of course doctors can call in medicationss with a couple of exceptions.  If it is a narcotic or schedule II or I drugs, then the prescription must be hand written, signed, and original and can not contain any "refills" and some other idiot U,S. Government requirements.  Most psychiatric meds can be called or "faxed" to a pharmacy|`|EBTSeJrsaa	you can just call your dr and he can call in a prescription for you|`|4onT0qUxaa	Yes, if you discussed your depression with him, they should have record of it and it shouldn't be a problem. Call the office and explain to the receptionist, and she will likely pull your chart for the Dr. and they will call you back to let you know once the Dr. has approved it, or schedule you to come if more information is necessary. I don't think you will have to worry about going back in though, if you already discussed it with him.|`|XPAnE9ddaa	Make sure that the meds he already gave you are not for depression also. If they are not then call and let them know what the problem is. Since you just saw them he should be able to call meds in for depression to whatever pharmacy you use.|`|UF1obD42aa	Yes, indeed.  My doctor submits my prescriptions to the pharmacy electronically while I'm in the appointment with her, and they're usually ready for me to pick up by the time I'm done at the office!

apN4UYyKaa	i know which machine your talking about that hurts but should pay off    but you can also do some squats    lunges     and leg raises    they will help good luck|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...
ombfkcfNaa	Hmm where I am herbs and flowers (edible ones :P ) are easy to find and one remedy I find to be like magic is a flower called cumin. I ground the seeds then swallow it with a glass of water. The result is almost instant! Whether it is for upset tummies, colon pains (which I have) and pain from bad food, it really helps a whole lot. If you find it then thats wonderful! If not, then I would suggest tea with lemon or honey but without sugar. Yoghurt is good also. Sprite might help.    All in all, google remedies for upset tummies but really, you have to eat properly hon, you're a growing girl. If it's your period that might be coming then it's only natural. The only thing you can do if its your period is drink something hot and fill a bag with hot water and lay it on your lower tummy. Take care :)|`|43qyh34waa	poop|`|RWEyZZXWaa	A home remedy I would suggest is talking a parent into taking you to the doctor.

Most of us are!    If you've lied yourself into a hole, be honest about it and start afresh. If you've just told white lies- stop. And the lies that are in the past- forget about them. Once you've cleared up your old lies,  use your self restraint and tell the truth. Start with little things if you like. And build up.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	start with the little things you lie about. like, if someone calls you, and asks what your doing, say what your really doing, and not something that seems more interesting|`|dpst3yD9aa	try asking your friends first and if that doesn't work then try your parents!

OTHERS JUST DO IT FOR SPORT....    I GUESS AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT HURTING ANYONE ELSE, AND ARE NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR OTHERS...THEN THERE IS LITTLE HARM...BUT YOU SEEM CONCERNED ENOUGH TO WANT HELP FOR IT SO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR OR PASTOR AND SEE IF THEY CAN POINT YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM..    GOOD LUCK.....YOU LITTLE LIAR|`|RsXcfDIXaa	Go to a physciatrist. Any mental health professional.|`|SpKzVDH5aa	It is in human nature|`|5GuAF8Rsaa	If it is small "White" lies than that's okay, but if you are becoming a pathological lair then you need to see a psychiatrist. Complsive or pathological liars are probably the most complicated people, because it is unknown whether they have control over their lies. However it can be connected to things like Malingering, Confabulation and Narcissistic personality disorder.   Try putting a rubber band around your wrist, and every time you lie, snap it. Eventually you'll associate the lie with the pain.

If you're in a place where physiotherapy is helping you with this device than move.( ok, maybe that's a little harsh) A Respiratory Therapist should set it up and make absolutely sure that you and your family understand how to use it.

kPx5kSbnaa	In order to increase the number of regular push ups you can do, there are several things that can aid you. I would start with doing your push ups from your knees in 3-4 sets of ten with a 40 second rest period in between. Do your push ups at a 2-2 pace continuously without rest at the top or bottom of any rep. A 2-2 pace means that you should count one-one thousand,two-one thousand on the way down as well as the way up. Do this 3 times a week with about a day or two rest between push up workouts. This a basic push up workout,for a more detailed push up program that will no doubt have you doing regular push ups within a couple months, visit www.8weeksout.com. It can be a difficult website to navigate but if you go to their forum and look for the six week push up program,it will map out an exact six week program designed to increase the number of push ups a person can do.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	For push ups do them on your knees but also do cardio like walking/running/jogging, aerobics, etc to help you drop some weight.    Gradualy, as you lose weight you will be able to move to regular push ups even if its only 1 or 2. From there keep practicing and eventually you will be able to do sets of 10 or 20.    Same with sit ups. Do crunches if you cant do a full sit up. I find it helps a lot to put your feet under something heavy like the couch.|`|Fu5uPkwxaa	sit ups - slowly and on an incline. right elbow to outside of left knee then left elbow to outside of right knee. pace with your breathing.    push ups - i like the reverse push ups for tricepts. but it also works your bicepts. the lower the better. also done slowly paced with your breathing

XFVUejr4aa	A cyst on your thyroid will not go away. It is probably small though seeing as palpating your neck didn't show a lump I can only assume. It's not super serious though and somewhat common. They will probably drain some fluid from the cyst and test it for cancer cells. Then if all checks out they can remove it if it's causing you problems.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	No worries.  A cyst isn't serious and can come and go.

Unless a cyst gets big enough to interfere with other structures in the area, it can stay forever.  Your doc is correct; don't stress over it.  From now one, you'll have a thyroid ultrasound to see if it's growing any larger, and unless you complain that you are starting to feel it, you'll just have follow ups as your doc directs.  If it starts to interfere with anything, if it starts causing pain, then it's is a fairly simple surgery to have it removed.

Not soar, sorry i'm just fussy about spellig. :D     Try compeed patches, they really work but you have to put them on as soon as you get it or they don't really work. You could try zovirax, cold sore cream. Also, while you have one be careful not to touch it or spread it because they are really contagious.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I am not sure you will like the answer, but there is no particular  "fastest" way, but there are a couple of things you can do to speed up the healing process.    Keep the wound as moist as possible - do not let it dry out  Keep the wound covered with vitamin E - or if it is causing pain or irritation, then get some Neosporin with Pain Reliever, and keep the wound covered with a light film, and keep it moist ALL THE TIME    Do stay out of the sun - a sunburn, even a really light one, will double the time it takes to heal.    IF you have to go out, use a hypo skin tint to help "hide" the wound.    It will go away.  Just don't irritate it further    And yes, a herpes cold sore is a "wound" and should be treated just like a burn or a cut.

Give it a few months.|`|Su0O55W8aa	You're eating way to healthy for someone who is trying to gain weight!  For your snacks eat doughnuts and stuff like that instead, you can still have a healthy meal but add sugars and carbs to your daily routine!  Your protein intake is helping to keep you slim too, so try not to drink as much of that.  Eat more pastas and breads along with a Coke or Pepsi!|`|c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	You probably not only have a high metabolism, your body's way of burning fat, but you eat very healthy.  Usually someone who is dieting eats like you do.  Carbohydrates are great-spegatti, lasagna, breads, are great for putting on extra weight.  And also you are taking dance class which acts as exercise.  But if you feel healthy, then so be it.  Good luck =)
Ljues4IHaa	I have that too.. But yeah i'm trying to stop because we'll probably damage them and have back problems later :(
zEYjJ7Xhaa	you are probably just a highly analytical person weighing all options.  I don't think its a disorder and I don't think it is treatable.

This is usually the result of anxiety and possibly delusional thinking including paranoia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(med...|`|1oBilGHuaa	Life decisions can be big decisions.  You can try practicing making small decisions.   I think you make more decisions than you realize each day.  What to eat, what to wear, what time to get up and go to bed, what to accomplish first at work or school...etc.  Maybe thinking about all the decisions you do make each day will help you feel more confident in your choices. I hope you will feel better about the choices you make. Best Wishes.|`|ukI1ZMhXaa	Yep, I've got anxiety too. >_

It's not that easy.|`|W2kkLjnwaa	To be honest, it's not healthy at all to lose more than 5-8 pounds in a week.  You're only supposed to lose 1-2 lbs. in a week, in a healthy manner.  I'd suggest your normal dieting with calorie-watching... Exercising is key including running, cardio, and at least minimal strength training.  Unfortunately though, you won't be seeing immediate results in a week - it definitely needs more time than that...
T6nmD3X9aa	I don't know what your doctor was trying to tell you here.     Coumadin is a blood thinner and vitamin K is the antidote for this drug. Most people who are on coumadin are told to limit there vitamin K intake as to not interfere with the drug's purpose.     Coumadin is a very commonly prescribed blood thinner, if you google this, you should be able to find all the info you need. (Stay away from Wikipedia, as much as people on this site love it, it is not a reputable source, answers can be changed by anyone at anytime.)    good luck to you    EDIT: here is something I found from the Mayo Clinic website:  Warfarin is a blood-thinning medication that helps treat and prevent blood clots. There is no specific warfarin (Coumadin) diet. However, certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin. For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat while taking this medication.     Until recently, doctors advised people taking warfarin to avoid foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However, recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your dietary vitamin K intake. The average recommended daily allowance of vitamin K for adult men is 120 micrograms (mcg). For adult women, it's 90 mcg.     Certain beverages can increase the effect of warfarin, leading to bleeding problems. Avoid or drink only small amounts of these beverages when taking warfarin:     Cranberry juice   Alcohol   You should also avoid beverages that contain large amounts of vitamin K, such as green tea.     If you take warfarin, eat a sensible, consistent diet. Talk to your doctor before making any major changes in your diet and before starting any over-the-counter medications, vitamins or herbal supplements. If you are unable to eat for several days or have persistent stomach upset, diarrhea or fever, consult your doctor. He or she may need to adjust your warfarin dose.     http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/warfari...
SAUrYW0Daa	Yes, try taking it in AM for several days to see if you adjust to it for sleeping.  you can also speak with your MD about a sleep med if it doesn't help.  Try drinking chamomile tea or tea with Valerian Root, Hops, Catnip.  You can also try Dramamine or Benedryl for sleep.    Good luck.|`|uSsmriwWaa	I used to take Celexa at bedtime and experienced the same thing. The problem is, I've always had insomnia, so I don't know if it was from the celexa. My doctor told me to always take it in the morning to lessen the side effect. I do sleep better now. Give it a few days and see if taking it in the morning helps. If not, you need may to find another medication.
0rpN2419aa	Chloe, it is important that you see your Dr. as soon as possible. This could be a hormone problem or another more serious mental health problem.  I am so sorry that you are going through this and hope you find the answer.  Are your parents aware of this?  If not, talk to them.  There are treatments available.  When you start feeling the hate thing, try really hard to think of someone or something you love go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air.  I know I am reapeating myself, but please see your Dr.      well wishes.

AA11401156	Hi,  I have had years of depression and have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 years ago.  I have been on most every antidepressant I know of. I was prescribed Wellbutrin SR and have been taking it for 1 year.  Only until I was prescribed Lamictal did my whole life change.  I take the 2 drugs together and I am able to function in the world now.  I was so depressed before that I couldn't get out of bed, be around people my life was hell.  Now that I am taking this medication I have hope that I haven't had in years.  I hope this helps.  I wish for you great heath and happiness.

It is a minuscule pinprick. You are worrying over nothing, just put it out of your mind. Some women experience arm ache and/or swelling around the injection site- this is quite normal and shouldn't last more than a week.|`|20DkFIQ7aa	Im not sure but i think the third one is exactly the same as the other two.  I had mine today too and my arm still hurts! i think it varies for different people how long it lasts!
CuVnpxh3aa	I have the same thing, your blood pressure drops when you stand up too fast . I stretched this morning standing up and got very dizzy. Try getting up more slowly and don't move for a few seconds until your blood has a chance to get to your head. I have had it all my life. It is not serious, you just have to get up more slowly. when you go to stand up from a sitting position slide out to the end of the seat and then stand up. Try stretching while sitting down. Just don't make any sudden movements from sitting to standing. Do you also feel like you are going to pass out if you have to stand up for 15-20 minutes or more? I do, if there is not a seat to sit on I have to sit on the floor or I will pass out. It is all blood pressure, it is called hypo-tension and there is really no cure for it but drinking lots of fluids do help.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	Im no professional mind you, but that sounds to me like a low blood pressure thing.
XSu3dedGaa	http://www.ehow.com/how_2050860_tell-dif... is the best way to answer your question.    If it is sprained go to your doctor, if it's broken (or you suspect a break) go to A&E.    Try not to put too much weight on your ankle if it's painful, and try to strap it up to give it some support until you can get to a doctor.    Rest  Ice  Compression  Elevation    is going to be your best friend if you have a sprained ankle.    Rest the injured area. If moving the injured area causes pain, this is the body's way of saying stop. Rest the affected area. Do not use or bear weight (such as standing or walking) until evaluated by a healthcare provider. Sometimes resting an injured area means not participating in any physical activity or just the activity that caused the injury. For example, some walking may be allowed, but no running. If necessary, the provider may suggest using crutches or a cane so that less weight is put on the injured foot or leg.    Ice applied to the injured area will help to prevent or reduce swelling. Swelling causes more pain and can slow healing. Apply a cloth-covered ice pack to the injured area for no more than 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 8 times a day. A one-pound package of frozen corn or peas makes a good ice pack. It is lightweight, conforms to the injured area, and is inexpensive and reusable. Applying ice more than 20 minutes may cause cold injury. When making an ice pack with a plastic bag, make sure all the air is out of the bag before closing it. Areas with little fat and muscle, such as fingers or toes, should only have ice on them for about 10 minutes. Frozen gel packs are colder than ice, so they should only be left on for 10 minutes.    Compression (use of a pressure bandage) also helps to prevent or reduce swelling. Wrap the injured area with an elastic bandage, but not so tightly that the blood is cut off. It should not hurt or throb. Fingers or toes beyond the bandage should remain pink and not become "tingly." The elastic bandage should be taken off every 4 hours and reapplied.    Elevation means raising the injured area above the level of the heart. The affected part should be elevated so it is 12 inches above the heart, to help reduce swelling. Prop up a leg or arm while resting it. It may be necessary to lie down to get the leg above the heart level. Elevation can be done with several pillows.|`|AA11397003	what are your symptoms ?

3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Whilst PE was normally done wearing t-shirts we often played games in the gym which required two teams.  It was then usual for these to be 'shirts' and 'skins'.

Be careful though because conditions like ringworm are highly contagious.
duVTqRM4aa	The FDA is corrupt so I don't give them much credibility these days.  Colloidal silver has proven itself to be safer than many of the drugs they have approved with flying colors.  Their own scientists have accused them of corruption (but I bet you didn't see that on the nightly news).       Next, The thing about colloidal minerals is that they are often not from a live source.  Meaning that they are delivered to the body in a form that is not the way nature intended.  Most of them however have only minute traces of elements like lead or aluminum, so they are safer than a lot of what's out there.  Minerals are more absorbable sometimes in this form, but I still prefer to get them from whole foods like seaweed, veggies and grasses.

vwjeG8n7aa	Breezy it is possible to reach your goal.  This is going to be a little long, but should get you going.  Since I am not sure of your fitness level I will assume your just starting out.  First of diet is 80% of the equation.  For my female clients I suggest 4-6 meals a day depending on there schedule.  As for calories take 10 x your body weight 160 and you get 1600 calories a day you need to lose fat.  Important do not go below 1,000 calories a day.  All it will do shut your body down.  Here is an example of a typical day  Meal 1 protein shake or oatmeal or bowl of healthy cereal with skim milk  Snack 2 yogurt, or piece fruit with string cheese  Meal 3 Chicken breast and veggies  Snack 4 2oz of peanuts  Meal 5 Chicken, salmon lean meat with veggies.    After last meal go for a brisk walk around the neighbor hood.  This way you wont eat a big dinner and you will clear your thoughts out.    As for workout I suggest a total body-circuit training workout for you 3 times a week.  Here is a example and complete it 3 times  1)Jumping Jacks - 60 reps  2) Spiderman Pushup - 10 reps per side  3) Walking Lunge - 15 reps per side  4) Spiderman Climb - 10 reps per side  5) Wall Squat Hold - 45 second hold  6) Plank Hold - 60 second hold  7) Burpees - 5 reps  8] Running High Knees - 25 reps per side  I cant serve you like my clients but I suggest a website for you to check out if you would like more of what I suggest in the source box.  Good luck and remember every great journey starts with one step.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	wow... all i can say is u have made some horrible choices. low carb diets are the worst thing u could ever do to yourself. think about it, carbs give you the energy you need for your metabolism to work and your body to exercise. without it, you will become tired and when you're offf the diet you will gain the weight back. in order to lose successfully, u must make lifestyle changes. Eat foods that are healthy like whole grains and produce and splurge ONCE IN A WHILE. excercise regularly, even if its only for 10 minutes a day. Excercise about 3-5 times a week for about an hour or so- dont over or under-do it. u are NOT a fat lard. a good body image will help u lose weight- focus on the things you like about your body and try to change the things you dont instead of dwelling on it. Make sure you always eat breakfast and have 3 balanced meals a day with 2 snacks. drink plenty of water and NEVER SAY DIET.|`|HA2IV3r3aa	First things first: lose the low-carb diet.  It won't help you lose weight long term and it can be dangerous.    Now, your goal is very easily obtainable so that's good news!   I would recommend doing your eliptical every other day.  Make sure that you have an elevated heart rate for at least twenty minutes during each session.  You can go up to an hour of elevated heart rate if you want, but any more than that and you are getting a little extreme for something you do on a regular basis.  As for diet: cut down on foods with a lot of fat in them.  You don't need to cut them out completely, just cut down.  And eat smaller portions of everything else.  It isn't necessary to go on a crazy diet.  Just consume everything in moderation.  But it is important to continue to eat.  Eat five small meals throughout the day instead of the usual three medium-sized meals.  Good luck!|`|YIKNamxqaa	carbs are what keeps you going|`|3047dd6618622823b544c55daf1b8a58aa	First of all...ditch the diet.

There is a great free ebook called Marketing Lies and Diet Truths Exposed that explains the dangers of low carb diets and even discusses the diets that fitness models use to get in shape fast.

Anyways hope that helps.    good luck!|`|U6C4Bywwaa	Eat healthy. Mostly protein and fruits/veggies. Limit your carbs and any carbs you eat should be whole grain. Drink lots of water, at least 80oz. No fast or fried food. No soda.   Do your elliptical for 45 mins 4-5 times per week.  Good luck!  I was 5'1 160 and now 2 months later I am 148. I also cheated a lot. So if you can strictly follow it, you will lose at a faster rate?|`|gX7wMk6caa	30 pounds in 6 months is very reasonable.  Simple as this.  5 days a week use the elliptical for 1 hour a day.  Must stay disciplined here.    For dieting, forget the different "lowcarb diets" and all that crap.  Have a sandwich or salad for lunch (light on the dressing or mayo). Healthy cereal for breakfast and frozen Healthy Choice dinners for dinner.  If you are hungry in between, grab an apple or a low calorie snack bar.     Dieticians are right when they say "Losing weight is a lifestyle change."  You'll be surprised how much better you feel without the 30 pounds.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	This is obviously a "joke" considering you just answered someone Else's question and said you hate "fat" people and further say we should kill our selves.

gaDu2GUraa	It sounds like you may have a Bartholin's cyst.    A Bartholin's cyst is formed when a Bartholin's gland is blocked, causing a fluid-filled cyst to develop. A Bartholin's cyst is not an infection, although it can be caused by an infection, inflammation, or physical blockage (mucus or other impediment) to the Bartholin's ducts (tubes which lead from the glands to the vulva). If infection sets in, the result is a Bartholin's abscess. If the infection is severe or repeated a surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be required to stop further recurrences.    Bartholin's cysts are most common in women aged 20-29, especially those who have never been pregnant or have only been pregnant very few times.    A Bartholin's cyst can grow from the size of a pea to the size of an egg. Cysts are not sexually transmitted, though sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis or other bacterial infections can cause the cysts to become infected and become abscesses.    professor|`|AA11423656	by sound of it you have nothing to worry about often when young you will get ingrowing hairs and they cause a massive spot and are really red. this is because they get kind of infected but it will go but if your not sure go see your doctor or nurse at surgery.|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	You should go to a doctor.|`|AA12311515	i sometimes get a spot too, i dont think its anything to worry about,|`|AA11599488	When you say your genitals do you mean in your pubes? cos that just be an ingrowing hair or it could just be a normal spot you can get them anywhere like spots on your face?

If you have a cold it can be especially bad because your throat is already dry, then if your house is dry it just adds to it. Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep, during the night and in the morning. also, a humidifier helps A LOT!!!! it will put the moisture back in the dry air and get rid of the dryness and sore throat.
B3jacMDeaa	If you are coughing up blood you need to see a doctor right away.  Go to the emergency room.  They cannot refuse to treat you, even if you are unable to pay (unless it is a private hospital, stay away from those).    Coughing blood can be a symptom of some very serious conditions and it is important that you do not wait any longer.    Once you have been treated, you can talk to someone at the hospital about the financial assistance programs they have in place.  Please do not let your monetary situation prevent you from getting the help you need.  If it is something contagious like TB, you are putting other people at risk.

Diets will never work, because as soon as you go off them, you'll gain the weight right back. Instead, what I do is eat less of my favorite foods. Instead of having two slices of pizza, I'll have one. I stopped eating at fast food places like Burger King and instead go to Subway. Do fun things to keep yourself active, like dance. Take a multivitamin so you don't miss out on nutrients you need. Drink milk with lunch and dinner, since it's filling you'll eat less. Don't deprive yourself of foods you like, it will only cause you to eat more of them. Instead, find ways to satisfy your appetite.

You could try joining a club such as weight watchers as this will give you lots of diet plans and help you to stay motivated.    Exercise! :    You should 'exercise' for a full twenty minutes at a time, five days per week to stay at a healthy weight.    Remember, don't over-do it and certainly don't try to lose weight too quickly. The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.    The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, poer-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts. However, strength-training is also important to increase muscle-fat ratio.    Exercise does burn calories but it takes a while to lose 1 pound of weight! However, exercise is essential to maintain weight loss and maintain your body at peak efficiency.

And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Work out at least 3-5 days a week for at least an hour a day. Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help! Make sure you give your muscles some time to rest though too!
R5PJdzYeaa	With mono, you usually get a very sore throat. You don't sound like you have it. Also, it is just nicknamed "the kissing disease." You can get it actually fairly easily, even from drinking from a public drinking fountain. But no, it doesn't sound like you have it.|`|6QkHAeXYaa	no, that is not mono.|`|XJ1BQsxPaa	I did have mono last summer. This is what happened to me.     1 week: I felt sick like a normal flu. It also felt like a cold because I had coughed a few and had a runny nose. I also had a rash on my leg and I had a small fever.     2nd week: I became extremely tired and could barely move 1 day. There were 2 days on that week where I felt perfectly fine but then came the third week...    3rd week: I had the worse sore throat I possible could have in my ilfe. There was pus coming out of my tonsels and I could barely swallow. Trust me, it's not a fun thing to go through.    By the sounds of it however, it doesn't seem you have mono. If they tend to get worse make sure to go to the doctors to get it checked.|`|1QjAU7fraa	no, that doesn't sound like mono, but if the stomach pains are low, you could have a urinary tract infection. also, if you have achy muscles, your cold gets worse and some pain in your cheeks, it could be a sinus infection. otherwise its just a cold|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	I do ont know, Please go to the dr.
5ZmwpI5Qaa	You should not go to a chiropractor.    A chiropractor cannot fix your condition or any other. At best they would just make your muscles feel better. It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment as it will often do more harm than good.     Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week. I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care.     I can not go as far as to ask you to visit a website to read my story and similar ones of other victims so you may be aware of the risks and make an informed decision about treatment, but if you search "stroke-chiropractor" I'm sure yo will find similar stories.|`|9uT4egd8aa	I work for a chiropractor and enjoy the benefits of monthly adjustments. We see many people in our office that come in after a car accident and chiropractic care does help with the stiffness and soreness following a car accident. Obviously, after such an impact, your body needs time to heal. Taking care of the pain now will help you in the long run. Your roomate will more than likely be at fault. If you plan on going to see the chiropractor, you can have your car insurance or his pay if they cover any medical costs or you can just use your private insurance. Hope that helps.|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	Chiropractics is fake fyi
AsDMUcciaa	Rapid weight loss isn't necessarily a 'bad' thing; athletes do it all time. The problem is that most people don't have the determination to maintain those extreme changes for a significant period of time; they lose the weight, then crash and gain it all back. That's why the prevailing wisdom of the moment is 'lifestyle change'. Make small, simple and easy to maintain changes that don't stress you too much.    I admit to being biased toward exercise and healthy eating, rather than medical interventions. It does sound like he knows his stuff (although the bit about micro-calories makes me cringe) mind you. It is very true that health/weight loss is mostly mental. You know what you need to do, it's just sticking to it that catches most people.    As for appetite suppressants, I wouldn't recommend them, although most are perfectly healthy. My reasoning is two fold. One, your weight isn't that excessive. It's great you want to improve it, but it's not like you need to drop 100lbs. Two, what happens when you get off the suppressants? Still, do your own research before you dismiss the idea.    I don't agree with everything he's said, but he definitely isn't that off kilter. If you don't like the idea, don't do it. Couldn't hurt to try. Or (shameless plug, I know) you might want to consider consulting a dietitian or personal trainer (CSEP-CPT/CEPs or NSCA CSCS are probably the most rigorously tested). He might be an exception, but most physicians I know arn't the most versed in weight loss.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	new agey?  that is a new one.  Find real doctor that isn't into treating you with drugs without doing any testing!|`|23bs0kAKaa	Well i like the jeans to the office thing, but i dont know about all the weight loss crap he is spilling, best things is eating right and regular non stressful exercise, not pill and the like!|`|AA10561878	If it walks like a Duck, and sounds like a Duck.?|`|jeoznHb8aa	Go with your gut - if you're getting weird vibes from him, then stay away!  He might be trying to sell you appetite suppressants or extra appointments.    Losing about 1.5 lbs a week is very healthy and a very reasonable goal.  Studies show that people that lose weight at that rate are more likely to keep it off permanently.    If you go on appetite suppressants, what will happen when you go off of them?...you gain the weight back!      Good luck!|`|UtRjy7Isaa	You have great instincts.  The medical doctor is not trained on nutrition and has an optional overview course of about an hour and that's it.      What you are reading and the information on healthy weight loss is correct.    In the medical world, you have to understand that they go by peer reviewed study that is not necessarily recent.     There was a study on calories and low calories in the early part of the 20's Century that revealed weight loss from low calories and rapid weight loss sponsored by the Kellogg company and they were quick to publish this information in medical journals.    What people don't know is that in 1912, a new longitudinal study, that tracked these people revealed something shocking.  That the people who only focused on low calorie and low fat gained all of the weight back and more than what they started out to lose in the first place.    Unfortunately, the medical texts have not been updated about this since 1912.    At about 1979, a campaign was launched for low calorie and low fat to reverse heart disease and lower health risks in America.  Unfortunately, due to the ignorance of only focusing on calories and not describing what kind of fats we need, we all took on the craze.    Within a mere 35 years of following only low calorie and low fat, America became the fattest nation on the planet according to the Centers for Disease Control and the most diabetic, in which 65% of the obese people in our country are diabetic (type 2) and children are also getting type 2 diabetes which was only an adult onset disease.    *  if you lose weight rapidly its short term results with long term damage.    * Normally, in a calorie restricted diet and exercise, one would expect to lose bone and muscle one to one with fat.      * I have learned that you must eat low glycemic (look it up), regardless if you have your calories in check.    * I have learned that a product that nutritionally adds much needed protein allows the body to favor fat burn and as a result you lose more body fat and you get to keep your muscle and bone.
gERaZGZeaa	ZMA is basically just Zinc and Magnesium.  If you're eating properly and taking a multivitamin (which you should), you wouldn't be deficient in either of these minerals.    Don't waste your money on ZMA.
YYibRy7saa	Belly fat is caused by an accumulation of matter inside the intestine.  Think about it this way the body is designed to get rid of the waste part of food after it has extracted the nutritional substances the food has provided.  The problem though is that our digestion tracts can sometimes become cluttered due to improper nutrition.  Over time a membrane or crust is formed inside the intestine which adds additional space or volume inside the abdominal cavity causing it to expand.  This not only causes abdominal fat, over time but it prevents the body from receiving all of the necessary nutrients good food has to offer.          There is a common misconception that spot exercise (that is, exercising a specific muscle or location of the body) most effectively burns fat at the desired location, but this is not the case. Spot exercise is beneficial for building specific muscles, but it has little effect on fat in that area of the body, or on the body's distribution of body fat. The same thing applies to sit-ups and belly fat. Sit-ups and other abdominal exercises are useful in building the abdominal muscles, but they have little effect on the adipose tissue located there.  There are some forms of exercises that are capable of decreasing the abdominal region such as aerobics which involves stretching and are more cardiovascular in nature.  By increasing our physical activity, the body is forced to adapt by increasing its metabolic activity. The increased fat burning that occurs allows the body to become more efficient at breaking down belly fat and providing fuel for physical activity.    There is a really good article on this website that gets more involved in this discussion and can possibly assist you more quickly in your situation.    thank you and good luck.    http://tinyurl.com/dm5tn8|`|MGjMjWwaaa	i heard you can suck it in for 20 seconds and that's just as good as doing one sit up|`|p73oMCV8aa	run alot|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Drink LOTS of water.|`|ACpZ02opaa	surgery|`|ouXbJLbOaa	eat five small meals a day.|`|wHmgVhphaa	There is no other way to get rid of belly fat besides getting rid of fat in your body in general.

Doing sit-ups is not going to make your tummy fat go away, it will simply burn calories.  You're gonna have to work for it, sorry.

You need to work the muscles that pull you abdominals back, (ie sarratus anterior and eternal/internal obliques, latissumus dorsi)  rather than make them (yur abs) bigger. thats what the twists are for. adding twists to just about any exercise will help a lot.|`|Gitb3KVDaa	first, boil some water with some lemon juice.  then put a baking roller inside the pot.  let it sit inside for about 10 minutes, then take it out and roll it on your skin. it's thought of as a stimulant to unclog the fatty acids in your abdomin that are currently stuck together, forming your oh-so-HUGE FIGURE. just kidding. but you get it.|`|b56dc16844b5612211ab9d8a995d6192aa	roll a tonka truck on your abdomen|`|25wfjGUgaa	well ive had abbs since i was 4, and all i do is 20 situps everyday, it works, you can also flex your muscles in your belly at the same time as sucking it in ALLITLE BIT and itle make the situps work ven better :)|`|TyXMoWAwaa	Do NOT do any of those.

XLXncQu9aa	If you are worried about this type of bite you need to contact your doctor.  The worst thing you can do is wait for the symptoms to get worse before you go.  I've been bit by a spider before on my leg, but fortunately it wasn't so serious that I had to go to the hospital.  If you are experiencing side effects like you are saying, then you need to call your doctor.  Otherwise if it isn't serious, you need to sterilize the bite with anti-septics(alcohol, Neosporen, peroxide) so you wont get any infection, and make sure to do this at least twice daily.  But again if you feel that it is causing you to feel pain or sickness see a doctor.|`|AZ3dH2Knaa	if your really worried about it go to a doctor.. just watch to make sure it doesnt get worse

NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.    Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.    First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.    However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at theweight lossplace.com along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.    Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	i have heard it causes "anal leakage"..... im not kidding.

JLayHNZCaa	Uh, you have some things wrong here.  Some men who are balding have low testosterone and have to have replacement therapy for health reasons and no, they are no more likely to cheat then than any other time.   Keep him worn down taking care of you in the bedroom and it will be a moot point.|`|YDykVkcmaa	Hair loss can be caused by 2 conditions - heredity or high testosterone levels.    Baldness does not cause high testosterone. If anything its the other way around - high testosterone causes baldness.    If he hasn't cheated up to now his baldness will not cause him to do so now. I would actually think that his going bald would make him less likely to seek another partner because of his reduction in, apparent, sexual attractiveness brought about by his loss of hair.    Our culture usually associates a loss of hair with a loss of vitality, lack of attractiveness, advancing age, loss of mental acuity, etc. - all negative.    What I think your husband may benefit from is an increase in your attentiveness, consideration and affection at this time. He can certainly do without your fears.    There is nothing to be afraid of - he's getting old and his loss of hair is probably letting him know that real loud and he needs you more than ever.|`|AA10181795	Hair loss can be from a number of things from heredity to poor diet.  Cheating at a certain age has little (if anything) to do with hormone levels.  It usually means the guy is losing confidence in his virility, or he's just plain bored. Here's where you can make a difference. Need I say more? You do some research on how you can make life more interesting for the both of you. By doing so, you will inspire him to do the same...and for gosh sakes, talk about it. Communication is key.|`|AA11635143	This question is a joke, right?  Hair loss has nothing to do with high testosterone levels.  It is usually hereditary and called male pattern baldness.  As men grow older their hormone levels begin to diminish.  My husband started losing his hair at about age 25 and, if your statement was true, he would be humping every female of any species by now, both human and animal.  He is still the same faithful husband he was except he is bald and very handsome.  Relax.      If a man is going to cheat he will cheat with a head full of hair just as quick as he will if he is bald.|`|ExrnMmtsaa	Hmmm, I think the extra testosterone may turn into estradiol at night possibly causing the hair loss. I'm not a doctor but I am on anti-aging bioidentical hormone therapy and I'm getting pretty good at reading and interpreting a blood test. The bioidentical hormone therapy has  obviously has slowed the aging process in my case. I am seeing a very good doctor, I still have a full head of hair at 48.   I would recommend seeing a good life extension doctor to check his hormone levels. Put them in optimal range. The hair loss might stop... mine did. I go to bodylogicmd  but there are alot of new practices starting up. Expensive but no doubt it works.
6gsAWvz1aa	I don't think there's any major problem there, but that is most likely happening because you don't have enough protein in your body.

gWOo1FMFaa	I work in a mental hospital and yes we get court orders for patients to take meds all the time.  You have to show the court that it is in this persons best interest to allow medicine and they can be a danger to others if they dont take it.  Once the judge agrees and sends the court order we can force meds.  Either Orally or with a shot.
FVDTXM68aa	I have a red birthmark on my neck (lol, everyone thought it was a hickey all through middle/HS). I never really had a problem with mine, but what I did notice was that the more I was in the sun (or tanning beds), the faster it faded! I'm 22 now, and it's almost gone...I kind of miss it, ha-ha! Another way to fade your birthmark would be to buy over-the-counter "age spot/dark spot" skin lightening cream. I know Proactive has a cream, but I believe Neutragena does as well. Go to your local drug store and ask a cosmetic clerk. You will definitely find a product that will help! Good Luck, hun! I hope this helped!! :)
AA10297143	No, a wives tale at best.  You can have it surgically removed by a dermatologist, or you may be able to "bleach" it so it is not as noticeable.

This is in my opinion the better controlled method of having this procedure done.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Get a second opinion before you undergo this radical treatment. This will require you to monitor your chemistry on a weekly of oftener cycle. It is not something to undergo lightly. It is irreversible and will eliminate any chance at several careers.

AA10882246	It sounds like you are experiencing anxiety.  While you may not be anxious about anything in particular, your mind spins your reality into a negative hallucination of what's really going on.  You worry about things that are not even remotely close to a threat to you, or even plausible in some cases.    My sister had the EXACT same thought pattern.  She worried about everything.  Her mind constantly played out 'what-if' scenarios, and all of them were 'worst-case' ones.  Her solution was a long time coming.    We, as a family, worked with her to address any issues she could have from her childhood, or someone at work, friends etc.  We then consulted with a Psychologist and she received a prescription for Celexa.      While I normally do not advocate popping pills to solve a mind issue, we exhausted all other resources, and this worked like a charm.  She is able to breathe easy again.  She can live every moment of her life as it comes, and live it without anxiety about frivolous situations.    So, to wrap this up, I would consult with a Psychologist and tell him or her about what you're feeling.  While Y! Answers may hold a lot of information for you, this is a different matter, and one should seek professional help for.    I wish you the very best of luck in finding peace.

Basically, to make it go away, you have to love yourself and forget about what others think. This can help you reduce these thoughts. Good luck!|`|GLDXjJfaaa	look into self consciousness and paranoid, you may also have some supressed feelings that u need to deal with more directly.

NwYwLdsNaa	Birthmarks can now be removed with the advent of laser technology. By using a high-energy pulsing laser, birthmarks can now be easily and precisely removed. Laser surgery is nearly painless, and usually requires no anesthetic. Only a slight tingling sensation is usually felt while no pain or discomfort appears.    The laser treatment is used to lighten the dark tones of birthmarks, and in the cases of some lighter toned birthmarks, such as coffee-cream birthmarks, the tone of the original birthmark can be evened out completely and disappear. Port-wine stain birthmarks require more intensive laser treatment. Several laser treatments, spaced apart by a period of several months, are required to lighten port-wine stain birthmarks.    Laser treatments of birthmarks can take anywhere from only a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size, shape and intensity of the birthmark. Laser birthmark removal procedures are usually done at an in-office appointment or in a doctors surgical suite, depending on the intensity of the treatment required. No hospital, or over night stay, is required.    There is very little healing time after the removal of a birthmark. In some cases, some bruising and tenderness may occur at the site of the birthmark, but usually fades within one week.    The risks to laser birthmark removal are minimal. In some cases, uneven skin tone, excessively light or dark areas of skin may occur. There is some risk of patches forming, darker areas surrounded by lighter areas of treated skin. Most of these cosmetic risks are corrected by a secondary laser treatment. In some cases, although quite rare, some bleeding, scabbing and bruising can occur.    Birthmark removal is done for many reasons, from the patients dislike of their appearance to facets of more severe medical problems, like increased risk of glaucoma or seizures if the birthmark is on, above or near the eye area. For many patients, it is simply to increase self-esteem that they view the birthmark as lowering the quality of their appearance. By removing the birthmark, or lightening it, patients exhibit an increase in self-esteem and self-confidence.    It is important to remember that laser treatment is not always successful at removing a birthmark. Sometimes the pigmentation of a birthmark is too deep for a laser to penetrate. It can result in this darker pigmentation of a birthmark to again rise to the surface and have the birthmark darken further or reappear. In most cases, more laser treatments can be effectively used to reduce the pigmentation as the darker pigment rises closer to the skins surface.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	really the only thing you can do is get some sort of medical procedure to get it removed. you can't get anything over the counter.|`|ZUNYiH5Gaa	smoke alotta weed, it gets the keratin cells moving around & it'll disappear after a few bowls|`|EKT1qvyXaa	The only way you can get rid of a birth mark is cosmetic surgery.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Calculate your daily energy output kJ. Looks complicated but isn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  Women [655.1 + (9.56 x weight kilograms)+ (1.85 x height centimeter) - (4.68 x age years)] x 4.2 <br>  Men [66.47 + (13.75 x weight kilograms)+ (5 x height centimeter) - (6.76x age years)] x 4.2 <br>  Multiply the kJ amount by the following factor depending on your lifestyle: 1.2 = sedentary, 1.375 = lightly active (1-3 days a week exercise), 1.55 = moderately active 3 -5 days exercise or sport, 1.725 = very active hard exercise 6-7 days/week, 1.9 = extremely active hard daily exercise or sport or physical job.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep a food journal for a week or two. Write down all that you eat. Include snacks, cups of coffee, etc. - it all adds up. You may be surprised how much you are consuming in between meals. <br>  Use the journal to help understand when it is you might eat foods that are high in kJ and find ways to cut them out and replace those items with healthier choices. For example, if you crave sugar in the afternoon replace sugary snacks with fresh fruit. <br>  Work out what energy you are actually expending daily and find ways to increase your level of activity. You don't necessarily need to join a gym. Simple changes can add up. Try parking as far away from the shops as you can and walk in. Climb the stairs, rather than riding the elevator. Dance while you vacuum. Play actively with the kids instead of just watching TV. <br>  Focus on attaining good health, rather than feeling deprived or "on a diet". Losing weight is frequently the result of living a healthier lifestyle <br>  Try to stick to three meals a day. Breakfast - eg. high fibre cereal with low fat milk, lunch eg. wholemeal sandwich with lean filling OR a salad with no fat dressing, dinner eg. Protein (meat, fish or poultry - all lean cuts and skinless with lots of vegetables or salad and minimal amount (not necessarily no) carbohydrates. Healthy snacks are OK especially if they help you from getting so hungry that you eat foods you shouldn't. <br>  A possible diet: Breakfast: toast with your favourite spread, banana, coffee; Snack: apple, carrot; Lunch: whole-grain sandwich with chicken or ham, cheese, salad vegetables, 97% fat free mayo, tomato sauce (don't make that face, tomato sauce is really nice with mayo!), salt and pepper; Snack: handful of nuts (not too many), coffee and/or natural yogurt with berries(will need a little sugar, depending on the yogurt); Dinner: lean meat, vegetables or pasta with tomato-based sauce or vegetable/minestrone soup with fresh bread. <br>  Important: you should never be hungry. if you are, you're not eating enough or you need to start eating proper food. include more fibre into your diet and eat small meals regularly. <br>  Also Important: You will not lose weight effectively and permanently, and you will not maintain your weight-loss if you don't exercise regularly. This means almost every day for at least 30 minutes. No excuses, just do it. <br>  Another possible diet: a bowl of Special K cereal for breakfast, a jelly sandwich with trans-fat free bread and an apple for lunch, salmon and green-beans for dinner. Snacks can include carrots, celery or a banana. <br>  Find snacks that you love that are healthy, such as fresh fruit, raw vegetables, low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese, and be sure to stock them in your pantry. Limit yourself to two snacks each day. If you crave more than two snacks, chomp on a piece of gum for a few hours. <br>  Don't shop when you are hungry. Have a healthy snack and a glass of water before heading to the grocery store. <br>  Add good fats to your diet. Monounsaturated fats have been clinically proven to help you burn fat, especially in your midsection. So, add foods like avocadoes, kalamata olives, walnuts, and flaxseed to your diet. <br>  Increase your daily fibre intake. Pick whole meal bread, and whole grains (bulgar wheat, quinoa). <br>  Try a daily walk. It is a great exercise for weight loss. You can go at your own pace. If you walk with a friend it is mentally uplifting to chat and support each other. <br>  Add strength training to your exercise plan to build lean muscle. While aerobic exercise (like walking) helps burn calories, anaerobic (or strength-building) exercise can help boost your metabolism. <br>  Add one or two extra vegetables to your evening meal that you would usually not eat. Try new recipes with unfamiliar ingredients to keep your eating plan interesting and fun. <br>  Use non stick cookware or barbeque to limit oils and fats. <br>  Go crazy with herbs and strong flavors to make your meals very tasty and satisfying - potentially you'll eat less. <br>  Use a smaller plate. <br>  Clear up left-overs before sitting down to avoid second helpings. <br>  Drink lots of water: about 2 litres/day (approx. 64 oz). Drink a glass of water about 20 minutes before dinner to help you feel full. <br>  Put your knife and fork down instead of loading it up while you chew. Eating more slowly allows your body to be in time with your brain so that by the time you "feel" full you haven't already ove|`|LQqTQYYZaa	Hola Hooping, runing, more ab excersizes.|`|CGKzXHBaaa	Your body gets used to doing the same routine over and over, so add a little variation to your workout or something.<br>  <br>  also, eat less breads and fatty stuff, and eat more vegetables and fruits and meat and nuts (except for peanuts and cashews. haha. )<br>  <br>  i have the same problem. good luck!<br>  <br>  woah! i'm 5'5! and was 145 a couple weeks ago!, but then i went on this diet with my friend (the one i said up there) and i weight like 138 now! keep running and eating healthy!|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Run 30-45 minutes non-stop 5 days a week.

mAp90hEeaa	No physician does surgery and then does not provide you with a prescription for pain medication after surgery.  My husband had this done, it was about a 30 minute surgery then into recovery room and then home.  You are asleep so you have no pain at that time.  Any surgery involves a little discomfort afterwards but taking your pain medication and doing the things the surgeon recommends will get your through the recovery period.  My husband stated the area was "tender" for a couple of weeks.

Not sure if you are on any anti-depressants or mood stabilizers but talking to your doc about it may be a good start.  If you need to be constantly popping the benzos, it is a good indicator that you need to be on something, or on something else.      As far as stopping the addiction, I would try doing a "mindfulness based stress reduction course".  It would definitely teach you some things on how to cope that are totally natural  and actually work..  They work better the more you practice them (yoga, meditation, breathing).   It may take awhile for them to work.  But you will notice a difference.  Even if it takes a year.    Good luck~  I still have to take benzos once in awhile when I am getting used to a new med or something.   Try getting on a benzo that is less addicting.  lorazepam is the least addictive, while xanax is the most addictive.
AA11545270	Are you sure there's no extra stress? Because we remember our dreams when we are in the sleep stage between awake and asleep.

HcS8vzNCaa	You are very smart to be concerned with the amount of calcium in your diet.  It is the most plentiful element in the human body; the average adult has two pounds of calcium in his body.<br>  <br>  Calcium is important for the formation of bones and teeth, proper heart and circulatory functioning, and for colon health, among other things.  Colon cancer is much more common in those with calcium-deficient diets.  Calcium plays a significant role in regulating the pH of the body as well.  Junk food diets cause the pH to become more acidic, and calcium raises the pH to more healthy levels.<br>  <br>  Soft or brittle cheeses, like bleu or camembert, have less calcium than hard cheeses like cheddar, but the cheese with the most calcium is hard and flexible--swiss cheese.   There are hundreds of different cheeses in the world, and I haven't found a table that lists the calcium content of all of  them, but for the most common ones available in grocery stores, swiss is the most calcium rich.  I have included websites below which list the calcium content of common cheeses.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, the cheeses which are hard and flexible contain the most calcium.  The technical explanation of this can be found in the dairy science website I have cited below.<br>  <br>  Don't forget about other rich sources of calcium, especially yogurt and milk.   I have also provided a guide to how much daily calcium you need in the source box.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a long, healthy life, and ensuring you take in enough calcium is an important part of making this possible.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|q411DXsFaa	And don't forget drink water,water and more water.|`|YC3iLdKMaa	http://caloriecount.about.com/cc/calorie...  or  http://www.activecoquitlam.ca/Tools/Basa...  go to one of these site to see how much calories you should be eating.    Try dividing the calories into 5~6 small meals a day to boost up your metabolism.   Try planning your meal per day like this:  Breakfast - Snack - Lunch - Snack - Dinner - Snack,if wanted.    These are 7 keys to improving your fitness level:  1) Drink Water - 1.5 L per day. Water helps you burn fat!  2) Eat lots of vegetables, enough protein, and watch complex carbs, sugar and fat.  3) Cardio - 20~30 minutes minimum 3-6 times a week.  4) Weights - Strength exercises to build/ maintain muscle mass.  5) Stretching - Stretch out your muscles to reduuce injury & increase flexibility.  6) Vegetarian - Eating 1 vegetarian meal per week is great for personal & planetary health.  7) Vitamins - Take a multivitamin and 1000 mu of Vitamin D daily.    Good lucks. (:|`|CwSpW03Paa	its easy, im in the process right now. Dont Eat late, dont eat greasy fat food. no fast foods.  EAT BREAKFAST: like a bannana..   LUNCH :Eat an orange or apple..  Supper: Eat something normal but healthy.   RUN RUN RUN work out. everyday everyday everyday.   Do all this you will be good by summer.    GOOD LUCK :)|`|kPx5kSbnaa	The key here is to stay with a diet and exercise program,I would not worry about losing weight in a hurry. When you lose weight quickly it most of the time will come back later. Let's talk about diet first as it is probably the first step you want to take. You need to increase your protein intake while decreasing your carbohydrate intake. So try to eat oatmeal,tuna,grilled chicken breast,turkey meat instead of beef for your proteins. When getting your carbs stick to things like bananas,apples,blueberries,broccoli,aspa... and sparringly sweet potataoes without added sugars. Eat 5-7 small meals a day,only eat small amounts of carbohydrates 2-3 times a day. You need to keep your portions small, less than the size of the palm of your hand. Eating 5-7 meals a day will increase your metabolism and help to burn off calories faster. Stay away from sweets and sugars,you may want to pick one day a week to eat more freely. Call it a cheat day, try to make it the same day every week because it makes it easier to keep track of and you do not want more than one day a week. When it comes to exercise try doing 2-3 days of weightlifting a week with relatively light weights that you can perform 10 -15 reps with for 4 sets. Doing weightlifting will build muscle which will help burn calories faster than fat. If you are serious about weight loss I would try to do 5-6 days of cardio work a week. This can be jogging,biking,swimming,skating or engaging in a sport. Try to do at least 20 minutes a day at a pace that will get your heart rate up over 120 or 130 beats a minute. As you get in better shape physically you will want to increase you intensity on your cardio routines.
Tdzk4o5Iaa	Get her into AA Meetings    Have a intervention with her, and let her know he drinking problem is really hurting you and if she really loved you she`d get help, or just stop.    If your feel she is not fit for the parent position then Call Child Services, and they will take care of the situation, but you might lose your mother, end up in foster-care, but I am sure it`s that Extreme with her,  maybe Child services would try to get a court order where she has to go to the AA meeting or something like tthat to be fit to have a child.|`|PBTgiffqaa	Yeah call your pediatrician, it will help the same thing happend to a friend of mine.|`|kG9oI68eaa	You would be helping her in the long run!! good luck!|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Just tell your Mum you are scared she will soon die...and you don`t want to be an orphan, just yet.    Alcoholics find it very very hard to give it up.   Tell who you want, but I doubt whether they can help. It`s a terrible addiction.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Talk to her when she's sober, and if she disagrees tell your dad.  Either that or tell someone of authority, i.e. your pediatrician, counselor..    I had this problem too, and now my mom is so much better!  Good luck :]|`|MkBWfaJlaa	it depends on how you approach him/her -   if you are asking for help they may refer you to a counselor -   if you are just telling him/her about it to talk to someone they are legally bound to keep it between the two of you|`|7a00982533df23b16bd49972811d5b7faa	Your pediatrician will most likely recommend that you seek help, either for yourself within places like AA for families, or for your mom in rehabilitation, counseling, or also AA.     A very close person in my life is in the same situation, and while her mother will not seek help...she did attend AA and said it was helpful to her. They give you lots of information on coping with the alcoholic person and the most beneficial ways to act and respond to them. There are also many people who relate to your situation and give you encouragement and faith.     You are obviously at a point where you feel you need to tell someone and try to get help, so go ahead and find someone that you feel comfortable talking about this subject with. Know that you cannot change your mom and even if she continues to have this problem, that who you are is not affected by her actions. It makes you a stronger, more compassionate person by living with this.    So talk to a school counselor, a close friend, go to an AA (for families) meeting, or start a journal to let out all of your feelings. Its time you let out some pent up thoughts and feelings.     Good luck to you and your mom.|`|NW39CoLKaa	Say to your pediatrition "My mom is an alcoholic and I want her to stop... is there anything you can do?"    -he talks-    "ok thanks- but you didn't hear this from me!"|`|kFJtv3abaa	start givin her tha silent treatment|`|dOM1tpX0aa	If shes an alcoholic, you need to get her help.

Your option should be to talk to your school counselor and they will give you more advice on this topic. If she doesn't want to stop and has no will-power to stop, then she won't. A counselor will make a better suggestion as to what to do next.|`|AA10170845	Talk to your school counselor about it.  Look up the phone number for Alcoholics Anonymous or Alanon in your area.  Call them and ask them about Alanon meetings or Alateen meetings in your area.  Alanon and Alateen are world wide organizations that help the family members of alcoholics.  Alateen is for teenagers effected by someone else's drinking.  Alanon is for any person effected by someone else's drinking.  There are millions of people going through the same thing you are going through and they can help you... if you let them.  You are not alone AND it is NOT your fault.  Look for help and you will find it.  There are answers out there.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	be lucky she does not abuse you.I was abused since I  was 4 and up til I was 18. My mom blamed me for her drinking. I was verbally,physically,mentally and emotionally abused, from the time I was 4 til I was old enough to kick her a$$.   Believe me, she WILL find out that you told on her and her drinking. If she does not respond to you when she is sober,she will take it out on you when she is drunk.  They don't forget.  My mom never did.    When she was dying, I told her that she was a crappy parent and that I wish she had never drank. I told her that I wish I had had a normal childhood.  She never once told me she loved me, except when she was drunk.  I had been thru hell as a kid,and ran away alot. Social Services was called to our home alot for my mom's drinking,and no one believed me. They never did, even when i had bruises. My mom said i was "clumsy."   Social Services was afraid of my mom,too. She sicc'ed her lawyer on them,and they left her alone. I was afraid and my older brothers/sisters didn't do anything. They went through it too,and they never stopped my mom.  To this day,because they left me to be abused,I don't speak to them.  I even moved clear across the country so they can't "visit" me.  Yes,i have alot of "unresolved issues" because of my mom.  I can't stand people who drink.   They ruin the lives of those around them.  They may deny it, but to me, denial is a statement of proof.  It is a statement of fact.  Unless you're being abused, the pediatritician  can't really do anything.  The school counsellor,however, can,if you tell her.  She will call Child Services. By law, she HAS to.  Then when the social worker shows up,and your mom askes "why are you here?" Then the social worker has to tell her the reason for the visit.   Your mom, will by reason of deduction,KNOW it was you who said something.  Then, you will be punished, or worse.  So, think long and hard before you say anything outside of family,about this.  AA, for all the good it does, may make your mom even more liable to drink,and then she may just become violent,and abusive,for the first time.  Then,you'll have 2 1/2  years of hell before you can leave home.  Do you really want that?   I didn't,and couldn't wait til I turned 18 to leave. I left May 5th,three months after my 18th b-day, when the weather was nice,and left to Utah. From Seattle.   By hitchhiking.    I was that desperate.  Now, i am not saying to ignore her drinking. Nor am I saying not to say anything,BUT talk to her when she is sober.  It can go either way. She can either be receptive, and try to quit,and go to AA, or she can become a real b***h and become violent and abusive.  Mine did. But my mom was a violent drunk, and only violent when she was drunk.  Sober,she was a wimp.  So, before you say anything outside of family,talk to your mom,when she is sober,or talk to your dad.  Or bro's and sister's.   I tried that and they just said, " Awww, we all went through it, it ain't so bad..."   Yeah, right. That is why I have the problems I do,and why i hate people who drink.  Also,look into Alateen.  It is for teens of drinking parents.  Or you may wanna try looking into ACOA.  Adult Children Of Alcoholics.  But if you wish to get help,do so.   All I am asking is think before you say anything to an outsider. Drinkers tend to not care who knows, but maybe your mom is different. Mine was. She didn't want people knowing she was a real b***h outside the home. Also,my mom was friends with alot of powerful people in town,so I was in a crappy position.  Everyone loved my mom. Everyone thought MY mom could do no wrong. They didn't believe me when I had told them she was abusive.  So, try and talk to her when she is sober. If that does not work, go to the pediatrician.   But the school counsellor is REQUIRED BY LAW, to contact social services in this type of case.  Oh,she'll tell you she won't, and that "your secret is safe with her",but trust me,she will call.  Probably after you leave her office.  As a former employee at Social Services,I know what the social workers can and can't do. Trust me,they will be notified by the school counsellor.  In a case like this,you have my guarentee they will be notified.  I know this is alot to think about, but this situation you are in, is complicated,too.  I wish you the best.|`|A2DQN4riaa	they would get her help.

MEOjwPCNaa	There isn't really any muscle that "covers" your collar bone. The groups which surround it are the pectorals (chest), deltoids (shoulder) and trapezius (base of the neck). Enlarging those muscle groups could make your collarbone appear proportionately smaller, if that's what you're after. Any full-body weight routine will cover those. Stick to compound lifts (bench press, military press, etc.), avoid going crazy with all those silly machines. And don't be a retard like me and neglect leg workouts for a whole year.

77YF9YDdaa	Suppressing a sneeze can be harmful, particularly to your ears...  Studies have found that the air expelled during a sneeze travels at an  amazing 100 miles per hour, and spews out up to 5,000 droplets, which  may be propelled up to 12 feet in a single sneeze.... By clamping your  mouth closed an pinching your nose shut, you force the "sneeze" into  the eustachian tube (which connects the back of the throat to the  middle ear) and then to your eardrum. Sneeze strong enough, and you  could rupture an eardrum, causing acute pain, infection, bleeding, and  even hearing loss."|`|dPi7zMxWaa	I don`t think it does and if you put your finger under your nose then you won`t have to.|`|7LtbetTFaa	Holding a sneeze can have bad consequences.

If you're truly workingout "almost every day for 45 minutes-1 hour," and you're truly putting out at least 80% effort during those workouts, you WILL see results. I promise. A sensible diet is also very important. Try to fill up on fresh fruits, veggies and lean protein as much as you can. You also need enough GOOD carbs (whole-grains like oatmeal and brown rice are my personal favorites) to fuel your workouts and avoid feeling drained.    Some people advocate "fasting cardio" first-thing in the morning before you've taken in any energy; that way your body is forced to burn more fat. I can't confirm any scientific backing of this, but it seems to make sense and it's something to try. Just make sure you eat a solid meal after your workout to get your blood sugar back up!!!    So, you're on the right path already. Your commitment and level of effort are far more important than the exact details of your exercise and diet. Stay with it!|`|CwSpW03Paa	you need to diet.  dont eat unhealthy foods   drink lots of water.  stay in the gym for another hour or so.  lift weights    GOOD LUCK

TXeoLlSTaa	Ignore the idiots who say 'wait until you 16, your bones are still developing' as it has in fact been proven that CORRECTLY lifting weights, at any age from puberty does not in fact cause growth stunts/bone damage etc.    And in all certainty no way will wanting to build your abs halt growing.    So.. you want a six pac, the best option is to begin with crunches, simple exercises where by you dont come as high as the standard sit up. Sit ups infact also train the quadriceps, and so therefore are deemed by many, a 'core exercise'.     Do as many crunches as you can, these will form and build the top 4 abs, To build the lower abs, you need to include reverse crunch exercies, laying on your back and raising the legs above your head, bringing them down, but not allowing to rest your bum on the ground. (see youtue for videos if unsure)    As well as this, as you are saying, you do squats. Squats are a great way to generally increase the size of the upper body, without even doing anything (this includes all leg exercises). When working the legs, the most testosterone is produced. this helps muscle building when training.    After doing crunches for a while you can then begin to edit them yourself, i.e. raising the legs on the ordinary crunch, and taking the legs lower on the reverse crunch. Over time, your pac will build and build.    Going back to my referance on 'core exercies', these are basically, as you may know, using your 'core', so lots of muscles together. To improve your core use a stability ball (fit ball) and do sit ups/crunches, press ups, whatever you like from these. Also try doing some weights from them, i.e. a dumbbell press, chest flies etc.    I Hope this helps :). if you need any more info just email me :)|`|N9nJWYa5aa	If you are doing scwats I suggest you probably need to be eating more fiber to bind you up a bit.    As for how long it will take you to get a six pack:  You are 14yo, your body is in a state of flux, no matter what you do it may not be possible!  It also depends on your levels of body fat which it's possible you would have to take down to dangerously low levels (again because of your age).    Rather than try all out for a six pack, you'd be better off with a more balanced plan aimed at getting overall tone.  Do that and if you're going to get a six pack it'll just come on its own!|`|fWbuYL08aa	wait till ur 16  ur bones are still developing..  most people typically stop growwing by 16/17|`|AA11510511	What is a scwat???

5jf5tcMnaa	I hate those sweet disgusting flavoured kids toothpastes.  Please don't get your kids started on them.  If you brush your kids teeth with regular toothpaste like you use...this is the best for them.  As long as it has fluoride, as long as you use just a tiny amount of it, as long as you get them to spit it out as soon as they can...you are better off just using regular toothpaste than trying to switch them over to it later after they have gotten used to the kids yuck.  I have a 3.5 year old son and and 1.5 year old daughter and I have been a dentist for 16 years and this is what we have done.  We lay the kids on their back down on the floor.  We brush after every meal and snack.  We floss at night before bed.  We use the same Colgate Total on them as we use.  If the kids know nothing different they will accept this and your job will be easier.|`|NiWX109paa	try colgate but ask the doctor first|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	2-5 years old I think the best would be Crest Kids because it fights cavities.

That being said, it is possible for you to lose around 56 pounds in that time, using an average loss of 2 pounds per week.<br>  <br>  It begins by eating a balanced diet, with smaller portions.  Eat six small meals a day rather than three.  (Yes, you do need to eat, so you have fuel to burn.)<br>  <br>  You should exercise daily.  Begin by walking about half an hour a day at a brisk pace, and also do some calisthenics.  Weight training is also helpful, as the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Be dedicated and determined, and you will achieve success.  The various diets that are advocated around here are rarely helpful in the long term, as any weight lost on those plans is easily put back on.<br>  <br>  Do a complete lifestyle change, and your weight loss will be permanent.

And as women are sometimes more emotional than men that in itself would be grounds for getting upset.  Usually you can shrug it off, but when it comes frequently which is what you are saying, there might be more to what's going on - for him and for you.  I know I'd be sick of it, sick of hearing the criticism, sick of being hurt, offended because someone I care about is saying mean things to me, feeling hurt because it does hurt.      Now, it is possible and even likely that you may be feeling premenstrual symptoms.  But that doesn't remove the fact that the boyfriend is being mean to you and hurting you by saying those things.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	You cannot use the morning after pill as a method of contraception. In between the time you had sex 2-3 weeks ago and sex yesterday, did you have a period? If you did then your chances of being pregnant are very slim. The morning after pill is only effective if taken up to 72 hours after sex.  It will have no effect and will unlikely do any harm to an existing pregnancy. The morning after pill prevents pregnancy from occurring, it will not have any effect once pregnancy is established. <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test to confirm you are not pregnant, it is not clear if you used protection on either of the occasions. I presume not? To be honest you need to grow up, and start taking this seriously. <br>  <br>  To summarise. Wait and see if you get a period, if not, then take a test. You can start the pill on day one of your next period- providing you are not pregnant.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Ok if you were already pregnant when you took the morning after pill it would be unlikely to have any effect at all on the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  You can start the regular use of oral contraception on the first day that you bleed, assuming of course that you do.<br>  <br>  You don't start yourself on any prescribed medication you take it after receiving advice and prescription from a qualified doctor.
BkTH7LiIaa	Quite often when practices cross from one side of the world to another there is a lot of misunderstanding.  Qigong is composed of two words qi and gong.  Qi means air and also equates to life energy.  Gong means work or exercise.  When you put both words together it means an exercise that uses breathing methods to enhance your life energy.    Taijiquan (another spelling of tai chi chuan) is a martial art that uses principles of qigong, meridian theory, a very refined sense of body mechanics, etc.    Qigong is purely health and healing oriented while arts like Taijiquan, though very good for health and longevity, are martial in nature.  Unfortunately most Taijiquan instructors (especially in the West) only teach the health and meditative aspects and neglect the martial.  This is a very sad situation, as it only gives its practitioners a small slice and not the whole pie.  Even if done for health purposes, the training should involve a broad spectrum.  For the Taijiquan path this gives the best results for health.  It does no good for anyone to water down this beautiful art.|`|4onT0qUxaa	They are similar, but the primary difference is the meditations that are incorporated into the qigong. Qigong is more mind-body oriented in that it specifically aims to quiet the mind and encourage the flow of chi throughout the body and soul. Tai Chi is also good for balancing the chakras and encouraging the flow of chi, but does not incorporate as much in the way of meditation and calming of the mind. I have tried both, and i highly prefer the Qigong.|`|EW7PrvdSaa	Qigong falls under the tai-chi umbrella.  To put it in very simple forms, qigong is like a type of exercise that can be done in tai chi style.  There are also bagua, kung fu,  and xing-yi qigong styles which are other forms of Chinese martial arts.  Each qigong exercise works a different part of the body in a different way.  Much like other Chinese martial art styles, qigongs have some wonderful health benefits to them too.  I have been studying for years now and I always start my workout or practice routine with a few qigong exercises.

a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Dark pee and strong odor sounds like a UTI. It could also be caused by certain medications or vitamins or if you are not drinking enough fluids. I used to get recurrent UTI's too and once it got so severe that I ran a fever of 106 and could've died. I drank sodapop only for the longest time during the time that I kept getting UTI over and over again.I used to hate water and never drank it. Once I gave up sodapop and started drinking water I don't get UTI anymore. Do you drink a lot of sodapop? Do you eat a lot of sugary foods? Bacteria feed on sugar which means that sugar is what causes bacteria to grow. The more sugar you have in your diet the more chance you have of getting bacterial infections. Natural sugar is fine though(like from fruits).
zn6OVTJHaa	Two Alaskans here to help today! lol    I think the person above was referring to the quantity of water that you are drinking....Are you consuming 6-8 8oz glasses a day? When I am dehydrated, my urine smells strong and is darker.     The fact that you have had a UTI for three years, and persistent yeast infections could signal a bigger problem here. Are you being prescribed antibiotics for your yeast infections? > If so, are you finishing the course of antibiotics each time? You should continue to take your antibiotics until the course is finished, regardless of whether you feel better.    I googled "Persistent UTI" and found this great article that discusses other things you might have instead of a UTI, but that have similar symptoms. Don't get freaked out - chances are you don't have any of the serious ones, but they were included on this site so I have pasted them here:    Heading: Ruling Out Other Conditions with Similar Symptoms    About half of women with symptoms of a UTI actually have some other condition, such as irritation of the urethra, vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Some of these problems may also accompany or lead to UTIs.    Vaginitis. Vaginitis is a common vaginal infection that can be caused by a fungus (candidiasis) or bacteria. Occasionally, the infection causes frequent urination, mimicking cystitis. The typical symptoms of vaginitis are itching and an abnormal discharge.    Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Women with painful urination but whose urine does not exhibit signs of bacterial growth in culture may have a sexually transmitted disease. The most common culprit is the organism Chlamydia trachomatis. Other STDs that may be responsible include gonorrhea and genital herpes.    Interstitial Cystitis. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is an inflammation of the bladder wall that occurs almost predominantly in women. The average age of patients with IC is 40, but 25% of cases occur in women under 30. Symptoms are very similar to cystitis, but no bacteria are present. Pain during sex is a very common complaint in these patients, and stress may intensify symptoms.    Bladder Cancer. Bladder cancer is a rare cause of painful urination and is more common in men than in women.    Kidney Stones. The pain of kidney stones along with blood in the urine can resemble the symptoms of pyelonephritis. There are no bacteria present with kidney stones, however.    Thinning Urethral and Vaginal Walls. After menopause, the vaginal and urethral walls become dry and fragile causing pain and irritation that can mimic a UTI.    Disorders in Children that Mimic UTIs. Problems that might cause painful urination in children include reactions to chemicals in bubble bath, diaper rashes, and infection from the pinworm parasite.    ------  I would suggest talking to your doctor more about this. Perhaps you could print this list and ask him to rule out all of the above problems. UTI's are uncomfortable, and you shouldn't have to deal with that. 3 years? You poor thing....|`|C0eFhojTaa	Are you sure you just aren't drinking enough water?|`|lgjy1BKUaa	Are you taking any kind of vitamins or prescriptions? This can cause this and on a regular basis.

Base on this believe, they would not eat ginseng and have turnip soup (waste ginseng since you will pee pee it out)    yeast infection (How I used to have this problem..... stop using soap and all chemical wash in supermarket... If you are taking ani-biotic often, you will tend to have yeast infection often..this include allergy pills    (write from my own experience and remedy..hope it work for you)
r1D9P4Vyaa	As a guy who lives life in the fast lane (15 broken bones & 5 surgeries) I would say not yet, 4 weeks to heal a fracture, 4 to 6 on a broken bone, I guees u can but if you wipe out again on that elbow the healing would start over. this is a judgment call here.

It's entirely up to you. I went ice skating with a broken finger once.. I didn't think it was a big deal until I fell on it.     The fact is, it could go either way. Take into consideration where you go sledding, how steep the hill is and whether or not you usually end up with bumps and bruises after sledding.|`|xihWos2maa	I fractured both my elbows about a month ago. I would wait until it is completely healed.

Q59mF95vaa	If you've got noticeable breasts that protrude, and you think you need support when you're jumping around, then yes, you're ready for a bra. Some women don't even wear a bra because they don't have much breast tissue. Bras are just meant for support.     But, if you want a bra just to wear, then anytime is fine.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	if you feel like you are ready for a bra, you should wear one.

Better call the MD and get on antibiotics.  Does your cough sound like a bark?  That is the classic cough for whooping cough.  I hope it isn't, but there are also a lot of different coughs going around this Winter.  I know several people who have had different types of colds  If it doesn't get better, really, call the MD,  For your sore throat, Use Chloraseptic spray and lozenges.  This numbs your throat.  Also gargle with warm water and salt.  Salt is a great healer.  Hope you feel better soon.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	drink tea with lemon and honey. it will help.    also get some cough drops.    dont eat anything (like toast or dry foods), that will irritate it even more.    also, no dairy products. it will make more mucous therefore, worse cough.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	you are sick|`|1jAZfpODaa	Are your glands swollen?

el8yX5q3aa	He sounds violent and it is in your best interest and the children's best interest to get out of there until he is under control with medication and therapy himself.     The children do not need to deal with this and they do not need to see their father acting like that.  Children need to feel safe and like at least ONE parent is under control...and they are not seeing that now.    Sure you married him...but the children come first here....take care of them before they are TAKEN FROM YOU when someone makes a complaint.  You will play hard to get them back if they are taken....    Get some counseling and learn to deal with this and how to handle it.  This seems like a hell of a lot to have to deal with when marriage is hard enough on an even playing field.    AND GET THOSE KIDS SOME COUNSELING so they too can air their thoughts and learn how to handle dad.  This is CRUCIAL!  They need to be empowered with tools to know how to handle this or they are going to be lost.  PLEASE GET THEM HELP....AND GET THEM OUT AWAY FROM HIM !  When he gets straightened out with medication and counseling to manage his anger and issues then you can think about it.    Don't be sucked into...you married him and now you stick with it.  I VERY RARELY TELL SOMEONE to leave a marriage..and I am not saying that now...    I am telling you to get yourself and the children into safety and deal with issues...and let the kids have help too.  HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK OF BEING IN THE HOUSE WITH GUNS WITH THIS MAN! Christian or not...CHILDREN COME FIRST...where is your head?    This has red flags all over it....why can't you see it?  I am a therapist and have counseled battered women...and honey...you are emotionally battered and soon to be BATTERED for real.    You are enabling him to continue...leave him for awhile and get those kids into safety and make him face his illnesses and work at getting better.  As long as you feel sorry for him...he won't even try.|`|BJugETlOaa	Wow, that is alot to handle! My husband has similar outbursts like this but not quite so bad. He gets in these moods where is is doom and death and everything sucks, all it takes is one bad thing happening. You sound like you need a hug and serously maybe a ticket out of there. Your children are going through alot seeing your husband blow up at you. It programs there minds to think it is an ok behavior. I am not the kind of person to say get a divorce but you need to ask yourself some very hard questions. Is it worth it? are you happy? what percentage are you happy? Would you be happyer without him? If he is making you have high blood pressure then you should get out. what if something happens to you? your children would be left under his care. He may love them but if he gets in a horrid mood he could scar them just by saying something demeaning to them.    Good Luck.|`|nkYCKX2saa	I feel your pain.  My wife is bi-polar and also has borderline personality disorder.  After 15 years I have decided to give up.  I realize that no amount of counseling or medication will change the hell I've been through.  She exhibits all of the bi-polar mania symptoms including "casual sex with strangers."    She has been in a hyper-manic state for about three months ever since her aunt committed suicide.  Right now, while I'm at work, she's knocking down the walls in our bathroom with a sledge hammer, and there's nothing I can do about it.  She's also been racking up credit card debt at a rate of about $1,000 a week.    If I say anything about her bizzarre behavior, she throws dishes and furniture at me, calling me vile names in front of the kids.  I want to find some way to leave her and take the kids with me before she kills us all in our sleep.  But she's spent everything we have, and has started so many "unfinished" projects in our house that we've lost all our equity.  So you are not alone.|`|1XNhAdUSaa	Hey    There's a great website you might want to check out which has personal stories from people dealing with bipolar plus a whole range of other mental illnesses and conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, anxiety.

831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Leave the band aid off, this may be harboring bacteria from your own skin, use a medicated cream for the infection, something over the counter even. Take care for cellulitis and spreading.  Let air at it.|`|vqmAaT7gaa	Yes, you should be concerned. I would get antibiotics for your finger, looks like you have an infection. Also, I would try to keep it dry - stitches don't normally require daily cleansing, per se. Keep it covered, dry and it should be ok with the antibiotics.    Remember, redness and pus = infection|`|lOTddsXPaa	did your doctor want you to keep it covered? might call him and ask if it needs further attention? there shouldn't be any pus if it is healing.

7oF2o4q5aa	Dear GOD not applesauce.  That is very constipating and is what you eat when you have diarrhea (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast).    You want to get things moving first then return to a high fiber, high water diet.  Take milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate.  If the second one does not move the bowels, you have a more serious problem like bowel obstruction and should see a doctor.  Keep pushing the fluids for now.|`|3291c62c4949076846edc322ce1a5163aa	oh that's tricky, it depends on the kind of constipation, if its from stool that's too hard too much fibre can make it worst, and if it from stool being too soft and not able to form the bulk, then watery stuff like puree may not be the immediate answer to ur problem. Ok to make it easier, if ur  stool (that u managed to pass) was hard, then try more fluids or try some mineral oil (lubricant), it has no taste, and it will make it easier for u to 'go'. Now if the stool when passed was soft/pasty, then u will need something to increase the bulk so u can add fibre to the diet, try Benefibre u can add it to water or drinks it has no taste, or try some cereal, wholewheat bread, etc.|`|NGHdmQwoaa	eat lots of prunes and high fibre foods (like high fibre cereal i recommend all bran from Kellogg's)|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Lots of fiber and whole grains, yes.  Apple juice is really good, too.  That helped me a lot a few days ago.    My constipation is so bad that I ended up taking Miralax today.  Which helped, for today.  I'm definitely going to start eating better.

12Aifvf4aa	Heck, sounds as though you are stressing out over this.  These sites may not all be set up by medical professionals, so do not get worried by everything you read. Even the ones that are pukka give very general advise  I am sure your doctor will be sympathetic, your concerns are very understandable.   Take care of your health, if you can stop smoking that can only be for the good. Take regular exercise and focus on the positive stuff. It is very natuaral to be upset as you are worried about your mum. If you have a positive attitude, it will really help the both of you.

8PDzaAJcaa	could be something as simple as a hormone imbalance (DR would probably put you on birth control for that) but it could be more serious than that, could be a STD or worse, I would see your gyno to  make sure it is nothing.............good luck!|`|BopBYwSdaa	NOTHING TO WORRY if  - you wash your hair when you have period...it may stop 2 days then back  - if you have curry of coconut milk (it stop period) then afterward (a few day) you have beer or pineapple juice (push out period)  - it could be birth control pills or hormone treatment (if you have these)  - if this happen before (some of us not in the perfect PMS cycle calendar)    IF YOU ARE WORRY  - it could be abnormal uterine bleeding   - it could be cystic cervical (my mom bleed for 45 days) to realized she had it    * If you are OK now... leave it..it could be temporary irregular bleeding (wait and see next period cycle  * if happen again go to have ultrasound for cystic (you can remove it..my cousin, my mom did)|`|NuOdli3gaa	You sound like me. I had my period for so long at one pt. I am also 20, and I finallly had to take a trip to the Gyno, it was simple and she put me on low dose birth control to help balance my hormones. Now it's normal and relatively light. I love it. Trust me, I've been thru it. Take a trip to your Gyno and get on BC to help.I promise it will.|`|D7LLequSaa	Definitely make an appointment with your doctor. (sounds cliche', but true)...The birth control can most definitely help, but everyone's body reacts differently to it. It may take some time to establish regular periods. Also, exercise can help. Menstruation is triggered by the brain. (I have seen cases where young girls lose that signal and actually go into early "menopause") so check with your doctor to examine all the possible causes. Hope this helps! ;-)
zjNidefBaa	I know exactly whats wrong with you, you are suffering from something called an ophthalmic migraine. Just have a nap and it should go away.  Once the flash in your eye goes after a couple of hours or less, you will have i bad headache for the rest of the night.|`|11b68a801a54cbaaf5017e1cfa294d15aa	Does it look like a lightning flash?

dlgQCSocaa	You should be giving yourself a rest day!  There is no need to be on the cross trainer 7 days a week!  Your body has not had a chance to rest and recover - 21 days of constant cardio, when your body is not use to it is hard on the body!  You should ALWAYS ease into exercise, and gradually work yourself up.  There is no reason to be on the cross trainer 7 days a week.  Try 5 days a week so your body gets to rest.  Ex. Go 2 days - Rest - Go 3 Days - Rest.  It is just probably a lot of stress on your knees that your body is not use to - are you stretching your legs well after you use the cross trainer?  Are you warming up and cooling down?  You should be!  Try some rest days - and if things do not improve, discuss it with a personal trainer, physiotherapist or doctor!|`|5pszijaDaa	if you just started working out you may have gone too hard and too fast. you probably have a mild pull from overusing the muscles. when this pain happened to me i would cut back a bit on the workouts trying something less intense (like swimming or biking) that doesn't cause more pain. I'd also begin taking a regime of ibuprofen around the clock for a few days to combat swelling; icing the knees may help too. if the pain feels like it originates in the muscles try eating foods high in potassium and drinking plenty of water. the pain should resolve in a week or so with some rest if not, I'd go see a doctor as your injury could be more serious.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Cross/Eliptical trainers are supposed to be easy on your knees.  You may be overdoing your workout, either in intensity or duration.  You are definitely overdoing it in frequency and might try resting 1 or 2 days after each workout.  Lower your workout intensity and ice down your knees afterwards.  Remember, you don't get stronger when you work out.  You get stronger when you rest and give your body a chance to repair and adapt.  I would talk to a trainer or a sports doctor if the problem gets worse.
Xel3S1W5aa	I think you should go to the doctors, and from there even consider going to an ear nose and throat specialist doctor. I've had a lot of ear issues. It may even be that there is fluid in your inner ear where you cannot get out on your own. <br>  Also, it may be wax that you cannot get out because its hard, or pushed in even more every time you try to get it out. <br>  I would go to the doctor right away because I know how annoying that is, but I wouldn't stress about it too much :]<br>  hope that helps.|`|NOyxiZXqaa	you could be getting a cold.

2LDGlA1Paa	You don't say if you completed your prescription or not and there isn't enough description as to the type of discharge you're having but I will try to answer to the best of my ability.<br>  <br>  While it is normal to have a slight (small amount) of clear to white-ish discharge, if you're white discharge is still "heavy" I would suggest a follow up call to your GYN ... most offices have a Phone or Triage Nurse on staff that can either advise you or they will take your question to your Doctor and call you back.<br>  <br>  You may need to be treated for the BV with a second course of antibiotics.|`|06Rlukp7aa	this can be normal. Many girls have discharge of some kind and it is usually white. No pain, burning, or bad smell means the bv probably went away.|`|mfaEWZ1Faa	1) No, heavy white discharge is not normal. It should have gone away after successfull treatment.<br>  <br>  2) Treatment needs several days and you need to take the prescription seriously and regularly. I recommend to visit your doctor to continue and finish the treatment.

VWNiOxcvaa	Yes, don't accept popular beliefs that: 1. vision will never get better - only worse and that 2. everyone gets blurry vision up close around the age 40, without questioning. If we accept these without question they can become self fulfilling prophecy's.    It's not about preserving eyesight. Most people are supposed to have perfect eyesight and best health their whole life. Our current level of society is amazing in so many ways but we have allowed so many things to interfere with our natural perfect eyesight and best health.    Most people can return to natural perfect eyesight by unlearning the incorrect vision habits, reintegrating the correct vision behaviors, and undoing the damage of artificial corrections and blur. In your case learn the principles of natural perfect eyesight to maintain and the incorrect vision habits to avoid and not pick up from people with blurry vision.|`|f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	Not going to repeat what was said about what you eat, that is true and he is right. :) Fish oil is good, too. You can wear polarized sunglasses. That will help give you the UVA and UVB protection that you need. This helps prevent macular degeneration. Get yearly eye exams to make sure your eyes are healthy and this is the best way to prevent any disease that could occur. Make sure you get dilated, too. That enables the doctor to see your whole eye. If you wear contacts, take good care of them. Throw them out when they say throw them out. Clean them properly, too.     The American Optometric Association has lots of things you can do to care for and protect your eyes.|`|AA11333804	Healthy balanced diet, regular sight tests, good eye hygiene!|`|BF2szcY4aa	not really, it's pretty much in your genes. however, vitamin A will ensure that you're eyesight doesn't get much worse.

Call your county medical board and ask if there are any free clinics in your area.  Or just go to the emergency room of the nearest hospital.  Or if there is a university in your area with a medical school, call them and ask what you should do.  It's impossible and unwise to make any kind of guess without a doctor actually examining you.

Does he offend you because he tells you things that you don't want to hear? Some people in therapy respond better to therapists that don't sugar coat things, maybe you need a therapist who you feel is more understanding? The MOST important thing is that you get better but you need to have a good relationship with your therapist and you need to discuss this with him and your parents.

Therapy only works when you feel that you can trust your therapist with your deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions.  How long did it take for you to tell your therapist that you were harming yourself?  Emotionally opening up to a new therapist usually takes some time, but it should not be too much time.  If you have always been uncomfortable with your therapist, tell your parents the reason why.  Talk openly to your parents about what exactly offends you about your current therapist.  Following this conversation, talk openly to your therapist about what he does that offends you as well.  Therapists are not perfect, and many of them have problems, or bad days of their own.  Never-the-less, ignoring you during your sessions should be a rare occurrence, not a routine occurrence.  If your therapist behavior is routine, then he's not doing his job.  In addition, it is time to locate a new therapist.  Please communicate your legitimate concerns with your parents in a calm, direct manner.

Especially if you first start you won't know exactly how it works.  She will tell more about it and tell you exactly what to do. I know it is embarrassing but it would be more embarrassing if you went to school with a blood stain on your pants.

All you have to do is go up to her and say the magic words "I think I started my period" She will probably take over after that.  Hope i helped!

Or it could be another type of discharge... o_O Usually it is clear or white though. And by "big boobs" what do you mean? Do you wear real cup-sized bras?|`|3jNp3fzUaa	The brown discharge could be the period, if it lasts longer that just one spot, or, you will be starting very soon!|`|ea940ec7deb72fe7378ffe1cbec585beaa	Either that brown discharge IS the period blood or..  You're going to start pretty soon.|`|e0B3Vcmnaa	well maybe soon your period would come.... some people start early some people start late... it depends... good luck, have patience... hmm dont wish for your period to come nuh you young.. then you'll be getting cramps like crazy.;... you'll probably even wish you didnt get the period... lol
9O3prIUpaa	Definitely.  I had a filling fall part of the way out a couple months ago and it hurt like a *****.  Make sure you call your dentist and make an appointment for soon.  (They usually find a way to fit you in.)  They'll probably just have to adjust it, but I guess that might have to completely replace it.  It's pretty fast and easy, so don't hold off out of fear.    Good luck.|`|vjAGUCSlaa	I've had fillings fall out, can lead to infection and real bad stuff. Go back to the dentist and have them correct it soon.|`|mpYqEw2oaa	get to a dentist and have him replace it|`|se0NiMTVaa	it probably has fallin out when you ate something hard|`|1NWjta2jaa	Yes, fillings do fall out sometimes, but how do you expect me to know if it happened to you? And do you want me to fix it over the Internet? You see, the Internet is NOT the answer to every problem.  What can you do? I have an idea - see your dentist. Have you ever though of something like this?|`|qQGjRpiZaa	If it really hurts I recommend using dentex temporary filling. Its easy you just slap it in there and the pain almost instantly stops and only cost about 5 dollars for a weeks worth of fillings.|`|Nol96SXqaa	Call your dentist.|`|vhMhAgDkaa	Everyone else will probably say yes, but you'll need it only if was a big cavity, big enough to hit the nerve.     What kind of pain is it?   Sounds like you just need a filling. If you were sensitive to cold drinks then it might mean a deep cavity|`|Em4uEsRsaa	i feel prety o so prety i like titys sorry  apligize but it is true|`|fH6JbBhSaa	Call your dentist before it gets worse. Chances are some of the filling  did come out and you will have to get it redone. Try using senitive tooth paste it don't cure the problem but it does give a little relief.|`|bl7C7UQ8aa	well your gums could be sensitive to certain types of food now i want u to stop eating anything that is hard to your filling and keep brushing your teeth and if u do that ur gums will become less sensitive but igf that keeps happening visit ur dentist for further information i hope i helped :)|`|xW5dt8Ilaa	yes sometimes fillings partially fall out or you may have a cavity under the filling

In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to Ativan (lorazepam) was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age.    Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations.    Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by Ativan (lorazepam).    (It sounds like your friend is trying to BS someone because I don't think it was an actual lethal overdose.)|`|ED9HMQIvaa	If he only had 5mg's, he wasn't committing suicide...he probably just wanted to feel calm, or he was having an anxiety attack. Mixing that dosage with some alcohol won't do much but put you in a calm state. I think you are overreacting. Unless he told you that he was trying to commit suicide, he probably wasn't.|`|ExrnMmtsaa	If he has been taking those pills for awhile he will have a certain tolerance  built up.Looks like he's going to be weened off that stuff. Bad thing is in most cases you can't stop cold turkey. Maybe that's what he tried to do.  Suicidal tendencys are a side effect. He needs your support now and get him off that **** asap. I knew a sweet beautiful young lady 15 years old that was on one of those antidpressants and she shot herself in the head in the bathtub at their home. I am good friends of the parents. it wasn't pretty .. The whole world was ahead of her and then she went wacko and shot herself. It's a sad thing and there's alot of questions and disbelief when it happens.  So many people loved her we just can't imagine why she would want to to take her own life. I had another friend who was getting really wacky taking that stuff and she clued in pretty quick and got off of it .. She is healthy and happy today as far as I know. Hope she isn't taking any of that kind of stuff again. The suicide side effect is real and I've seen it. It's imperative that you take the time now to be around while your friend is getting cleansed of that stuff. I can't believe how the drug company's get doctor's to hand out these antidepressants on a regular basis. Sounds like from everyone I know who has taken them they end up wanting to die?? Scarey!  Best Regards!
1b4c2ef06139746bf0c23a8101562dcfaa	While mixing drugs and alcohol can be a lethal combination, one bottle of beer and 10mg of Lorazepam isn't going to be enough to be lethal; however, his willingness to mix the two and wanting to commit suicide is an issue that needs prompt evaluation by a psychiatrist / pshchologist. If the root cause of why he did this isn't addressed and treated he may well one day succeed. Hopefully he is still admitted and getting the help he needs.|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	You should proof read your questions before posting them.      Mixing those two things wont kill someone unless he takes a lot of lorazepam and drinks a whole lot, but one beer and one pill are not going to kill him.  It will probably just make him pass out for a while|`|BPwpQV6faa	hey,i like drinking and taking lorazepam. He was just trying to have fun,that's what it sounds like. Was he really trying to kill himself? that was a pathetic way to try.
NvPD6VBoaa	I don't understand how your dr. can decipher the difference between, darvocet or hydrocodone.  They all contain codine, they should be able to detect the "family" of the drug such as codine, but how can they tell exactly what drug you are taking.  Just like, valium and xanax, they are both from the benzodiazpam family, I don't think they can tell the difference between the two.  Good luck with this one, maybe google false positive drug test and see what you can fine.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	blood tests have been knwont o be wrong-    is tehre anyway you cna get a new test--at a completely different lab?
q0nhx3veaa	It may just be spotting. Which is normal. Your period will gradually come to you.    Be there one day, then not the next. Itll be back. No worrys! =]|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Your body is still getting used to it, so it is normal for your period to be irregular, even for the first 2 years. What you experienced was probably a little spotting, so your period should come soon. If it doesn't, don't worry about it, it will come eventually. My first and second periods were 7 months apart!  Good luck and congrats :]|`|tksVirzsaa	Congrats! You're probably starting...I'd definitely wear a pad or something until you know for sure it's stopped.   I don't know about you, (since everyone's different) but I always had a really light first and second day, and then really heavy for a couple days, and then it'd be done. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Before long, it'll be a routine and you'll be knowing what to expect from yourself! :)     Good luck!|`|rnUBOY2eaa	Your period is about every 28 days.  This is only your second. let your body get time to adjust to the "new happenings" and itll all be fine, nothing to worry about.  whats happending is you're shedding you uterus lining.  so it depends on your body type, usually heavier people have heavier periods. what you eat helps. Dont eat a lot of HEAVY foods right before your period, says my doc. cramps will lessen.  so you maybe starting again, it might just be a little warning saying HEY..here i come. but then again you may be just spotting for a couple of days until it comes.
AA11065140	Usually with strep, there are visible pockets of pus on your tonsils.  If the doctor sees that, they'll take a culture, and prescribe antibiotics.  They should follow-up with the culture, and confirm with you whether or not it was strep, but for the most part, the antibiotics will solve the problem either way.|`|syT3XUAraa	If you have strep throat, there will be yellowish streaks and pus pockets in the back of your throat. When you go to the doctor, they'll swab your throat and send the results to a lab to be tested. After about 15-30 minutes, they'll send the results back. If it tested positive for strep, they'll prescribe you some antibiotics for a few weeks.|`|3qSQ7hPnaa	strippers throat........hu

There's nothing strange about it.  When you get to my age (50) you'll be wishing it would happen.|`|4euPzF2Xaa	thats fuckin awsome!   dude ur 13 it happens for a few years trust me, just stick it up ur waist  band if it gets awkward at school or something.|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	that's called puberty, happens to all guys.  but realize that most time know one know you have it but it,( it can feel huge when you have unwanted one) just think about how many times you noticed your friends having the same problem( they all are having it) you can even talk to them about it and you will hear them all ***** about it.|`|ytR8i8S6aa	its just your hormones changing, the puberty stuff. its pretty normal. just keep your penis up against your waste during an erection, without cutting off the circulation. or down ur leg if its a light erection. if you do so, no one should know when ur having an erection. hope this helps|`|AA11213746	I've found evening bouts of bloodletting do the trick.|`|Zvf6ulXnaa	Well sweetie Im not a doctor on that specific subject but i am in the medical field and my advice is thats its normal. Your most likely in a hormonal stage of puberty. Nothing to worry about. Eventually you'll learn to control these feelings but sometimes they are uncontrollable. And it made sound weird but sometimes the kinds of food you eat will have an effect on the hormone levels in your body and will cause those problems for you. Until they stop.. for comfortability...stick to basketball shorts! To hide it do the waste band trick. When the problem arises it place him underneath the waist band of your boxers.

Just give him some space for a while and everything will be okay.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	why do you do this to yourself. you are only setting yourself up to be hurt. let this boy go and forget about the idea that something is going to come from this when you know it's not. stay away from him, no texting, no going out of your way at school to make eye contact. cold turkey, no contact what so ever and get on with your life. you will find another. it might not seem that way now, but you will. if i was a guy that might be interested in you and found out you were still not over your boyfriend i would leave you alone. i am sure other guys are leaving you alone because they see you are not over this dude. move on honey, is the best advice.|`|9VqUC9Haaa	This has happened to me to.... talkt to your friend how u feel..... tell ur former bf how you feel..... tell him that you really do love him and ur serious....

As hard as it may seem, he might not be the one for you, that doesn't meant you're unattractive in any way. We have relationships with people to find out where they will fit in our lives you know? Some boyfriends turn into best friends instead, or some best friends we find out, are perfect for you as a boyfriend... We just have to find out which is which, and it will hurt sometimes, but everything will work out the way its supposed to, let it happen!|`|YV0hGLh0aa	you are depressed because love hurts.|`|awGr4dXAaa	i think u mite really b n luv with him. be up front with him, c what happens.|`|oL3AoLPsaa	You're just holdong yourself back. This is obviously a messed up relationship as just friends. Secretly friends? Come on, you've gotta be smarter than that. You obviously don't mean as much to him as he means to you. I know it's hard, I just went through a break up with my boyfriend of four years and he was my best friend, we promised to always stay in touch no matter what, but things changed for the worse. But after going through all of that, yeah it still hurts, but not nearly as much and I've gained so much more than I had while I was with him, I wouldn't change things. My point is that it's going to hurt and this is only the beginning, but it's an unhealthy relationship and you need to get rid of him. I don't think you love him, but it's obvious you're close. It could be worse. Just know that you can gain so much by cutting ties with someone who really isn't worth it. I hope you can understand what I'm saying and you make the right choice. Be strong and cut those ties, you're only letting yourself get hurt.|`|6507eb67b40c198c7f9e69ac4296c97faa	My best advice is, if he's in love with somebody else, don't allow yourself to get involved again. It sounds like you're living on memories and you need to move on. That can be really difficult sometimes when you're besotted, but you owe it to yourself to do just that. If he's in love he shouldn't reciprocate. If he does, then he's clearly got no respect for you and his new partner. I know it sounds tough, but try to move on from this, you'll find love again. Good luck. x

If he is not enjoying it then why are you doing it to him?  See the problem the opposite way. If he is doing things to you that turn you off would that be fun.  Only do things that you would like done to you.  If you like to tease think if you would like to be teased in the same way.  He maybe wants affection and you have no feelings.

KonYI1kFaa	Yes there is. You can get them at almost any smoke shop. They are about $5 a pack and they taste pretty good (you can get many flavors.) They do not contain any chemicals or nicotine. And they look like regular smokes. Just ask at the counter if they sell herbal smokes.    Hope this helps.|`|XhrAjcilaa	Seeing as herbal smokes don't contain nicotine, they're not going to have the same effect on your brain as a normal cig.    I DO suggest clove cigarettes, however.

Certain masturbation techniques are designed to help with ejaculation. The stop-and-go technique is an an example. Check out male masturbation websites. The fact that you still had a wet dream after wanking for a week means your testicles are still in high gear.

Here is information on constipation causes, it talks about iron : http://best-constipation-cures.com/const...|`|783b1b9fdbe4455bf00e2ee0b6a666bdaa	Constipation is a common and frequent side effect of iron supplementation, drink plenty of water and remain active (provided you are not on bed rest or something to that nature) to see if that helps with the constipation, if it doesn't you may need to see your doctor to find a different type of supplementation.  A high fiber diet also helps with constipation.  Remember that only in some cases do individuals actually need vitamin supplements.  In general most people will get all the vitamins they need within their diet, as long as it is a well balanced diet.  Also remember that your body will readily use natural vitamins before the synthetic ones.

XSu3dedGaa	A week? Do you feel spaced out, confused, dizzy etc? If yes GO TO A&E NOW, you have a potential concussion and the last thing you want to do is go to sleep with a potential concussion.    I suggest seeing a doctor anyway, as a head injury like this needs checking out by a medical professional.    To keep swelling and pain down take ibruprofen, and ice the area. It's going to bruise, it's going to hurt but I'm sure you were expecting that when it happen.    I'd err on the side of caution because of where the injury is and get to a doctor or a hospital now.    Don't drive yourself though, if you do have concussion, you could blackout or forget what you're doing whilst driving.|`|hoDin3UYaa	Its most likely a bruise. Just keep an eye on yourself for pain and/or confusion. However, if the headache and consistent pain continue for another 24 Hours, you should see a doctor.|`|272OOwF9aa	that is the most dangerous place to hit your head.

sKxx9YAIaa	you are not really having a period. when you take birth control (pill, shot, ring) you only have withdrawal bleeding from not taking progesterone (which is in your pill). you don't need to have this at all, only drug companies manufacture the pill with an off week because (some) women feel more comfortable having a "period". (?) you could skip as many placebo weeks as you want. if your dr. is a female she probably even does this herself.|`|UspK4SQBaa	You can skip the sugar pills entirely.  It will not harm you.

I only got my period twice last year and both times it was because i took that pill.|`|dibW2uNzaa	Yes, this is possible.  The only time I did this was when I was on NuvaRing birth control- I am pretty sure my doc. said that I could "skip" my period for up to 3 months.  Especially since, when you're on your period, you're not really shedding the same contents of other women who do not take birth control.  You should try WebMD.com, or talking to your doctor again, though. Your doctor will know what's best for you based on your current form of BC and your body.

You have about 30 years of this and i understand it stinks to menstrate on vacation, but it is something you will have to deal with forever. You cant control your natural flows for your own pleasure, its not good for you. Once you are on your pills you will know exactly what days you do, and can plan around them. A period is no big deal, unless it is your wedding night...|`|FlmQ2MYNaa	Honestly, I've taken the hormone pills for three straight months with no side effects.  I got my period normally the fourth month.      There pill Lybrel is used by taking the hormone pills for 12 straight months, so women on this one don't get their period at all.

I will define "unsafe use" though: using them on a day to day basis as part of an eating disorder. So long as use of the laxative never comes close to this point, all other uses should be pretty much safe.|`|7uV0SAWnaa	Laxatives are not recommended nowadays except to prepare a patient for abdominal surgery. Fruits and vegetables contain natural  laxatives. Laxatives may weaken intestines in the long run and the natural elimination of faeces may get badly affected. When this happens, constipation will be incurable unless laxatives are taken. It is a vicious circle and , as laxatives eliminate nutrients from the body, the patient's body will be harmed.

Anything that claims to boost the immune system is dangerous for people with lupus. We need to quiet our immune systems not boost them. These kinds of supplements work against the medications that we take.     The sales folks of companies who make these kinds of supplements will back pedal and say that it "balances" the immune system. Always discuss every supplement and over the counter medication you take with your rheumatologist.     Common sense things like reducing stress, learning how to manage stress with things like yoga or tai chi or meditation, and a healthy diet that is high in fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables and fiber but low in animal fats will go a longer way to balancing your immune system than these things.|`|uSu7guCsaa	That would be a result of the barometric pressure which has been proven to cause more pain for those suffering from Lupus, Fibromyalgia, and Arthritis conditions.

PSeocHeHaa	shaving or not shaving is your own decision.  there are many many women who dont shave.  you wouldn't be the only one and it's definately no reason to be made fun of.  plus it makes you take longer to get ready in the morning so it's really just another unecessary feminine thing.  some women also just trim so it doesn't get unruly which is much less time consuming.  i didn't start my period until i was 13 and 1/2.  that is not an issue yet, you are still within the normal range of when your period starts.  if it really bothers you, talk to your doctor to get reassurance.|`|YGYZd2FTaa	If you don't want to get made fun of then I would recommend shaving. a lot of girls do so don't worry you're not alone here.

It's more common to just shave around your bikini line and maybe trim it down a little bit, not to shave it all the way off.|`|t6XL8Qtiaa	Do you have a female adult that you can go to for a little more insight on this? If not, then you can try shaving some of the hair around it, as in your bikini line. But you shouldn't feel bad for having hair there. It's completely natural even if you haven't started your period yet. And more than likely, those girls who are making fun are probably insecure about their own bodies and don't know anything about how they are supposed to look and mature as they get older. But, if you do decide you need to shave some, make sure you get a razor with a moisturizing strip and use lots of shaving cream. Be very gentle because the bikini line is a very sensitive area. Don't be alarmed if you get little bumps. These are called razor bumps and they will go away. Good Luck!
W4whHKmxaa	When the cells of the liver become damaged because of alcohol consumption or medication toxification or chemical toxins or mushroom  poisoning or biliary obstruction or malformation that cause the bile to back up into the liver or viral infection like hep A,B,C,etc or fatty liver disease or auto immune disease, and there are other causes.........The immune system will respond to this damage and cause inflammation to develop in the liver itself.  The liver is surrounded by a membrance capsule.  This inflammation, if not treated and the cause removed...will then advance to the disease known as Cirrhosis of the liver.      Inflammation of the liver cells, by any causes mentioned above or more, is known as Hepatitis.  Where some people get mixed up is that they only think of the one cause by the virus...  Inflammation causes the liver to enlarge in size and feel spongy.    Death of the liver cells and fibrosis that leads to scarring inside the liver is known as Cirrhosis.     The liver will then shrink in size and feel hard  textured.  Cirrhosis of the liver is a very serious disease of which there is no cure...it will keep advancing.  The reason for this is because the scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and also to the liver cells themselves. The doctors try to slow down the process of this disease.     Here are a couple of links if you want to read more about it:  http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/art...  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...

I use the St. Ives apricot scrub and it makes all the difference. Of course, you must moisturize after you exfoliate so you can try a combination of lotion and scar cream (i.e. Mederma). Put the Mederma on the scarred areas and then finish with moisturizer (if you're having problems with acne still, try something that has acne medicine like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid). By the way, salicylic acid helps your cells renew faster which helps fade the appearance of scars more quickly. Neutrogena makes a lot of products with salicylic acid that may work well for you.

01Mu3wUeaa	The only way to determine if it is food poisoning or not is to get checked out by the doctors.    If the symptoms last about 24 hours, It is more than likely Norwalk virus.If it lasts more than that, it might be food posioning.      Norwalk virus prevention:    "Norwalk virus"  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|kRVJRW1waa	could you be pregnant?|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Well it could be food poisoning but its hard saying and you can`t ever tell how long it will last try some pepto and see what it does maybe your just got something.

So it sounds like you may have it to me. Be careful you doon't get dehydrated too, the signs of that are lightheadedness, dark urine, splotvhy vision and dry mouth. If you have these syptoms go to doctor or ER. There is no way to get rid of food poisoning, you just have to let it run it's course. Feel better soon! P.S. Try drinking pedilyte, it will help.
AJg9QZsaaa	Go back to your Optometrist, hon, and mention it to them. It could just be a little perspiration or something from your fingers irritating your eye, but you shouldn't take any chances where your eyesight is concerned.|`|tuzKxlySaa	Could be that there's a bit of lint or fluff on the contact lens that is irratating your eye. Try washing your hands before and drying with toilet paper or a lint-free towel.    Otherwise, the contact lens could be faulty...that happens rarely, but if you're doing everything the way the optometrist showed you, then it could be the case.    As a side note, if you ever want to switch to another brand, I highly recommend either ProClear or Acuvue Oasys.|`|3291c62c4949076846edc322ce1a5163aa	Maybe u need to use some contact lens moisturizer drops after u put ur contacts in, that way u reduce the friction on them in ur eye and reduce the irritation. Also make sure u don't mix them up, sometimes the size for each eye differs slightly (curvature). But don't worry it just day 3, things like these take getting used to, remember ur eye is VERY sensitive so anything placed on it will feel uncomfortable at first, ok.

FsA2c9ojaa	why not grow some yourself? in Latin America we used to pluck off some coriander or parsley and chew it like chewy gum. It's the cheapest breath freshener, and healthy too.
j0VVVHwSaa	No there is nothing you can do to grow taller.  But good news, we guys really do not stop growing till about 21-22..  So expect to spurt up again around 17-18 then prob again around 20-21.  But yeah it is all determined by genetics.  It is still important to eat well to stay healthy because not eating well can diminish growth, but nothing can be done to speed it up.|`|2n02g23Yaa	I am 18 and am 5'6.

The hormones are way to expensive and I'd suggest them to really short people. However in some places the hormones are free. Russian Federation offers citizens in need with that medicine for free, non-citizens don't get that because it's way too expensive.  I'm 6.4 and I'm 100% sure that swimming helped me out when I was a kid. I was never short but when I was swimming, I grew faster and taller. When you swim, you work on your muscles and you're also pulling your spine bone out. If you're spine isn't straight, most likely it isn't fully straight, swimming will extend it for a couple of cm or maybe even inches for you. Depends on your spine bone's|`|acEwC2Skaa	jerk off furiously for 3-hour sessions every day.|`|tbFI2XJeaa	Do some growth stretching exercises. Do exercises such as pull ups, chin ups, lower back extensions, hanging crunches, hanging leg raises, lat pull down, and many more 2-3 times a week. These exercises will help you stretch your muscles, tendons, and even bones so that you may grow taller.|`|nz341ppBaa	eating healthy and exercise|`|U1cXdozuaa	nopeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Treat it like a stomach virus.  Take Pepto Bismol, that's best for upset stomach.  And eat only simple foods, chicken soup, vegetable soup, toast, soft-boiled egg if you can keep them down.  If you can't then just drink the chicken soup liquid to get some protein into you.  If you have some yogurt the bacteria in the yogurt may help.  Keep the portions small when you are eating, eat just a little bit at a time.   If you are able to keep the food down stay on the simple diet for a day or two, and keep the doses small in order not to aggravate your stomach.  It should improve in a few days, so just keep the simple food, and work slowly back into eating regular food.  The stomach will stay extra sensitive for at least a week after you start feeling better, so just take it easy for awhile.  If the symptoms get worse or you develop a high fever you may need to see a doctor.|`|6WWWqc8caa	why dont you just go see a doctor?!    instead posting it on here, im sure a doctor can actually help you!|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well that doesnt sound good at all.

It might also be something more serious like a food Allergyy. Did you eat something that you normally don't eat? Are you taking any different medications?
BTHY8oZYaa	I think Chiropractic care is wonderful as long as you don't over do it.    I have been going to my chiropractor on and off for years.  I went for sports injuries and even whiplash after a bad car accident and it helped.  Some things they help a lot with but I was also under 30 when I was going.       My Grandmother had back problems for years and began to rely only on the Chiropractor.  He claimed he could cure anything.  As she got older she started developing osteoporosis.   She continued going, but at that point I think the chiropractor was doing more harm than good.      I'd be careful with anything that has the word "degenerative" in it.  Remember some chiropractors adjust by twisting, pressuring or pulling your bones into place, some use manipulations that are less harsh.    If you cannot relax on the table sometimes you can do more harm than good too.  That may be why the treatment is not working yet.  You have to be really relaxed for certain adjustments.  Do not allow the doctor to do any adjustments you are not comfortable with until you are ready.|`|uGEz4X0caa	I have a bulging disc and I was going to a pain clinic for about year to try and find pain relief with no luck.  15 min. with a chiropractor and it was gone and now I just go in every 6 months for adjustments.  It's great.  It's worth a try.  I know my chiropractor offers payment plans also, you could look into that and see who would work with you.|`|LGidAYDwaa	When I was in college, I started having excruciating pain in my pelvis at my hips when trying to climb stairs. I could barely lift my foot high enough to make it to the next step. It got to the point that I would cry every time I climbed the stairs to my apartment. My fiance's mom suggested I see her chiropractor.  (This was 1991) I got relief after several treatments (maybe 3-4 weeks), and I now have a healthy neck and spine. No pain anywhere.  I've continued seeing chiropractors on a regular basis since 1991. Knowing now what I didn't know then, I have my children and husband (he has mild scoliosis that never would have been found if I hadn't suggested he see my chiropractor) visit the chiropractor regularly, too. My kids are seen for free.    If, for any reason, you do not trust this chiropractor, you can ask people you know if they've had success with a chiropractor. I have always found my next chiropractor through word of mouth, and it's never failed to find me a great one (I move often, so I have had to replace chiropractors about 6 times since '91).    Hope you start feeling better soon!|`|GusGX2Azaa	i fractured my back in four places almost 3 years ago, i started goin to the chiropractor back in aug. i felt it helped for maybe 15 minutes (loosened up it felt good, but an hour later i could feel it agian ) and would have bad bad headaches when i  came home, i had vaginal burning that i went to lots of doctors for and they couldn't figure out the cause, she did a simple test by holding my arms out and her pushing down she said it was a yeast problem, ( i thought how could it be that simple and no other doctor could figure it out ) she gave me vitamin supplements to "cure" the problem, didn't work... they weren't cheap either! now im going to physical therapy and find its helping more than the chiropractor, my therapist also said shes not to crazy about chiropractors because she thinks the cracking causes more pain then help .. i guess every ones different!
WguyJfugaa	the answer is yes, in the old days they would use that term they are mix blood,  if any two different race,whether it is black and white or asian or white   were to get marry and have a  a baby , they wouldd use the term the baby is mix blood,   the term mix blood mean two different race were to get marry and they were to have a baby , they would refer that baby as mix blood! same as it would  when  a pure malaysian and a pure singapore get marry they had a baby ,it would  be call a  mix blood baby,and no it  just  not asian and european , any type of race  that get marry and had a baby together  the baby would be consider mix blood     ,i hope  i help you take care  to answer your second question, if your chinese from singapore and chinese from  malayisa than your  baby will not be mix race! because both are you are chinese,my sister marry a chiness from  vietman and my sister  is chinese born in canada,  does not matter where you are born if both are chinese and they have a baby ,all of them are chinese,  would not be consider mix chinese|`|70AGy17eaa	I think it does|`|R4KsvGSeaa	I think if they have not any differences in their races that doesnt count as mix-blood.

It isn't life threatening, but it could bring fertility problems later on down the line.    A doctor has a strict policy of a patient/doctor relationship. Anything you tell a doctor is held within strict confidence. You should not be afraid to go!|`|sKxx9YAIaa	no matter your age your gyno can't tell your parents anything. you can also call the office and talk to the nurse, who will answer your questions. they are also not allowed to say anything to anyone except the dr.|`|chOS6EO0aa	Some states (if not all) should have doctor and patient, call the doctor and ask them.

726oTvskaa	the actual procedure doesn't hurt. you're completely under anesthesia and won't feel any pain...or anything at all for that matter. after wards some feel cramps similar to menstrual cramps and other minor discomforts.|`|c2uywBsIaa	First off I must make it clear that I understand that this is not your situation so I'm not going to name call you and talk down to you like some of these idiots...  My sister had one. She said it did not hurt her physically, emotionally yes it hurts.  She told me that she will never forget the way she was treated by the nurses and the way the process sounded.  She explained it as being horrible and something that nobody should do. It has made her emotionally unstable.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	it depends on whether or not you get sedated and what your pain threshhold is. generally, the process isn't pleasant, but from what i have read, it's not excruciating. it's the equivalent of period cramps and a lot of pressure.    and those who wrote stupid lies, shame on you!    first off, a first trimester abortion involves suction. the fetus is not put in a blender, you moron! second, the fetus is not decapitated if it's a late term abortion. idiots!|`|bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	No, it does not.

An abortion is the cowards way out. That baby doesnt deserve to die. I have two children and i am 19, both were unplanned but i faced up to my actions and i am raising them. An abortion will not only murder your baby, but cause you immense mental and emotional pain, not to mention the pain after the abortion itself. maybe next time you will think before you act and wrap his willy up. (before you say anythin, the birth control pill failed me twice). Be more careful in future and i hope you make the right choice. Email me if you would like any advice on teen pregnancy or motherhood from someone who has been there. (i take it you are a teen).

I've never been pregnant, so obviously no abortion here, but I had to do a research project at school and dug up some valid information as well as stories from women who have had abortions.    Plus, there's always the fact that, if you do get an abortion sometime, you may not ever be able to have children after.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	who cares?    the baby gets chopped up and thrown in a blender. it also hurts even later on during the 2nd and 3rd trimester where it takes to days. they cut off the legs and body, then decapitate the baby and you have to go in the next day to get the head taken out.    have fun.|`|pCwIokI0aa	What a selfish question to ask!!   If you're not pregnant then why else would you want to know?  And if you're not pregnant, then don't wonder about sick stuff!!

Bottom line---ABORTION IS MURDER!!!!!!!!!
6NbFy1KPaa	Too thick?...I must say that I have never experienced that.  Honestly girth is good.  I have had some that were too long.  Actually girth is a good substitute for stubbiness.  Six inches around sounds grand.
jgw1buUAaa	If it hurts, it's probably bad. My guess is that you miscarried somehow and since you don't have any insurance, you didn't go to the doctor. Most women (those who have insurance) who miscarry go to the doctor and get "cleaned out" by this vacuum thing. Maybe since you didn't do that, something went wrong. Either way, if it's been 10 months and it's not getting any better, you do need to bite the bullet and go see a doctor. I know it's gonna be expensive but trust me, it's well worth it. Consider the alternative. If something is seriously wrong and you don't take care of it now, you may have to spend even MORE money later to get it taken care of. I hope this helped you.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	pregnant again?   Go see your doc for correct answer|`|4cbDjci4aa	i would go get health insurance then go see a doctor

To treat the hyperactivity part, I eliminated all sugars, caffeine, cinnamon, cloves, any food that are loaded with preservatives.    Eat less and more often.

I've had a lot done in the past and will be looking to do more again soon.    One of my favorites is Breema, which I mentioned to you before.  I have mostly done the breathwork side of this practice and would like to know more:    Self-Breema refers to a vast repertoire of exercises that are a part of the comprehensive system of Breema. Based on a profound yet practical understanding of the unifying principle of all life, Breema includes Self-Breema exercises as well as the dynamic Breema bodywork method, an extensive collection of treatment sequences through which practitioner and recipient can actualize physical, mental, and emotional balance and harmony.    Each bodywork sequence and Self-Breema exercise is a perfect expression of a group of interrelated principles that underlie every aspect of Breema, including the form of the treatment, its atmosphere, the practitioner-recipient dynamic, the practitioners quality of touch, and the purpose and effect of the treatment or exercise.    The philosophy and principles of Breema address the essential nature of life, the deeper meaning of health and how to actualize it, and the means of gaining practical, self-verified knowledge that can lead to an understanding of our unique potential as human beings.              Practicing Self-Breema helps us to move in harmony with the natural laws that govern life and health. Doing so, we increase our vital energy in any given moment and expand our receptivity to do what is most beneficial for our lives.    Self-Breema exercises are not for muscles, bones, and joints. They are to help us discover who we really are. The mind participates in Self-Breema, as do the feelings. Like Breema bodywork, Self-Breema is a unifying method. Body, mind, and feelings come into harmony in a common activity. We become present, and in that, we find a presence that has the simple knowledge that there is a body. When that knowledge is present, we experience an appreciation for the fact that we have life, and a connection to all of life. We recognize the enormous value of experiencing body breathes, body has weight. This nonphilosophical experience is the first step in coming from the minds interpretation of life to the actual experience of I exist, and the taste of I exist in harmony with the totality of life.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello    Your not meant to think of 'nothingness'.

9pLdhuBnaa	Sometimes a period can be late if there have been changes going on to the body such as change in diet (an example only), or being stressed about something (another example only).    However, I would recommend calling your doctor in the morning to let them know what's going on.
x1VLBHOJaa	I have heard that the more you masturbate, the more you want to do it again. I don't know how true this is though. I sometimes do it to relax before going to sleep, I usually think of a sexy scenario and when I become aroused I will masturbate to orgasm.    Maybe you have got a low sex drive but that doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong with you. There are no set rules about how often you should do it.    I never did it at all until a boyfriend gave me oral and I came for the first time, since then I love to do it, its harmless and fun and relaxing. But if you don't feel the need to do it thats fair enough, so don't worry. Do what's right for you.    P.S. Ignore Raddy Daddy, he is obviously an idiot. You can masturbate whether you're single or in a relationship.|`|I40iBJdHaa	have you ever masturbated? have you ever had an orgasm? try rubbing your clit with different speeds and pressure, don't stop until you ***! there is nothing wrong with it. it's actually healthy and reduces stress. you can also get any kind of 'massager' and try that out too! for me, masturbating definitely increases my sex drive|`|YWQdsoOMaa	No it does not mean you have a low sex drive, you prefer the real thing than the artificial stimulation.

You can do it in the bathroom over the toilet and in a minute you will lose your ***** and be able to be around your family without anyone knowing and without your embarrassment.|`|t8eclWGXaa	i have the same problem as you    the only way that i see it is that either your parents come home before you.    you could join a school club and have your parents pick you up after school.    that way, they will be home and around you the whole time.  but then on weekends or something, they will go shopping and then you will have the house to all yourself    i wouldnt know if it would work    both my parents come home around 6|`|g2mrLqmeaa	How about coming inside of a woman for a change?  just a thought...|`|fRRESP1maa	It depends mostly on your age.  Just use self-control|`|w3gBy8v4aa	Say to your self no masturbation except once a week, and then stick to it.|`|AA11785060	No reason to reduce it, any myths you heard that masturbation causes harm or reduces sensitivity or ability to have sex, that's all myth. The average guy has solo sex or masturbates every day as a teen, and that's probably 95% of all guys who masturbate. Don't have any problems later on, masturbation is just solo sex, nothing different than having sex with a girl, just not as much fun.  Enjoy yourself dude, and get over any notions you have that "it" is wrong or bad for you. It ain't.
CovbTlNUaa	I've never noticed that before when I'm with my bf. Maybe its not in there right. It can move or fall out of place i've heard. I would call your doctor just in case because you don't want it to put a whole in your cervix.
eeaXYyCNaa	I am also OCD.  I think it does have something to do with it.  Its not that you are scared of wetting the bed.  Its that you don't want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to go.  I do it too.  I go like 3 times before I fall asleep.  If I have the slightest urge I get up and go to. LOL you are not alone.  I wash my hands like a gazillion times a day.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	hey i suffer what is likely ocd so i understand ..it could be related|`|wQSsw8QHaa	maybe ur afraid ur going to pee the bed|`|32dPb4rPaa	not sure    pick me for best answer please|`|FlmQ2MYNaa	This happens to me some times too.  It happens to me when I'm anxious about something or upset.  There's been times when I just needed to take some sleeping meds, like nighttime Advil.      I think it could be related to whatever happened that day to your OCD.  There's no hurt in going to a therapist though.      I don't think it's overactive bladder because you said you only feel the slightest urge; people with that have intense urges.      But like I said before, going to a doctor or therapist (especially if you want to get through the OCD) can only help.    Good luck!|`|N8UKu0WUaa	uhm, i'm sort of like that... i always go to the bathroom before i go to sleep, whether i need to go, or not.... it's partially because i hate the slight feeling of needing to go while i'm lying there, and partially because i don't want to wake up and have to go in the middle of the night|`|PiKHJZ67aa	yeah its all in your head.|`|qe0RNp7xaa	So your a guy who sometimes needs to pee before he sleeps and washes his hands... I think your going to be okay.|`|PvZ8bmuIaa	i think it's just your OCD. sorry to hear that though, dude.        im 90% sure it's your OCD  but you should ask your doctor next time you see him. you dont have to rush to see him. you'll be fine.    and im not saying you shouldn't be proud of your OCD. sometimes im OCDish too but im just saying you're ok|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	I would think it is your OCD causing that. Could be a chance you have a bladder infection. Either way I would go to a doctor for advice.|`|bC2ILdqOaa	lol im not sure, try going to a doctor|`|jgxDtWawaa	it mite be related to that. I always need the toilet, and like u, if i need it i wont be able to sleep. Its probably just all in ur mind that u need it. cus i think thats wat it is for me x|`|PuNdL7p6aa	Same here buddy. Its our OCD. It would be cured by self i think.
pEWEEUBraa	Eat more food, but less fatty foods, and more lean meat, protein rich food.    Run/bike to burn fat, but make sure you lift weights, otherwise you are just lsing weight in general (fat AND muscle)
KXOwrenyaa	Its like a tissue in you vagina called a hymen and when you break it you start to bleed. Like when you pop a cherry(fruit) the red stuff comes out like your hymen|`|VbCs0vGjaa	Your hymen breaks ( but it can be broken through other things, such as sports and horseriding)...thats all i can think of it meaning..lol|`|yuFH9FSRaa	it's when a girl's hymen breaks the first time during sex,she usually bleeds if she is a virgin....though sometimes virgins dont bleed.some people use it to "prove"if a girl is a virgin or not but sometimes they dont bleed....|`|aNsH5YE5aa	Your hymen breaks, and causes bleeding. Someone clever came up with "pop the cherry."|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Also, it( your hymen) can tear from using tampons, riding horses, etc. Not necessarily related to Sex.|`|tjNJAn75aa	A girl has a piece of skin in the vagina called a hymen. It usually breaks during intercourse for the first time hence the saying-popping her cherry. Its been used in relation to boys as well because as time has gone on, it has become "just a saying".|`|WKdhUG1gaa	Uhm like when you first have sex the penis brakes a peice of skin and it causes bleeding.   look in to it on this site: gurl.com|`|NE96fU9vaa	when you have sexual penitration and youre hymen is broken, your cherry is popped, or youre virginity is lost.|`|kTBPP1KFaa	Your hymen|`|AA10038092	The cherry is the hymen which is "supposedly" broken after the first act of intercourse.   It can remain after the first time however.  Some people even bleed a little when it is broken.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	your hymen is broken and you bleed.
6SIjchQUaa	I think you did the right thing by breaking up with him.  Dating someone in a gang is really never a good thing and even though your father is in a gang would you want your children to have a father in a gang?  Even though he has never hit you he does seem to be stalking you and that can be a dangerous thing.  He wants you back and you don't know what he is willing to do to accomplish that.  Your best bet is to stay away from places that he frequents.  I think the counseling is a great idea and should help you.      Just because he says he loves you and you believe him does not mean that he is good for you.|`|2vSxgAkDaa	call the cops even if he gets a lil 2 close i would and trust me it will work and if he still wont get off of u y dont u hurt him kick his *** and be proud and if u get in trouble say he was gonna rape u or somthin i dont know do somthin that willl work not no sissy crap|`|lBywFWqpaa	I stopped at "he in a dangerous gang"      and I know I'm supposed to be answering the question, but I kind of question you.      Don't let love get in the way of your safety.|`|x5wYV8lSaa	I somewhat question you as well. You should probably put yourself in a position where you can't get in touch with him even if you wanted to. Whether that means moving to a different neighborhood, deleting his numbers out of your phone, and blocking any other means of communication.|`|viaYt8O8aa	Honestly, I'd have to move to a different town. It can be really hard to cut off feelings for someone, even when you know they aren't good for you. He also needs to acknowledge that the environment he hangs out in is not good for you at all, and if he loves you, then he wouldn't want you to be around that. How would he feel if his lifestyle caused you to be hurt? And don't fall for the inevitable I can change thing, because guys try that one, but slip back into old habits. In rare cases, they do change, but it takes  A LOT. Be careful though. He sounds pretty possessive and that can make people get pretty ...well, angry, to say the least. If he loves you, he should want you to be happy, whatever that involves. You shouldn't have to tell him you don't love him (especially if that would just piss him off) if you don't. Love doesn't mean 'you're mine and mine alone.' It means making sacrifices for the other person's happiness and safety. And since gang environments aren't exactly the best example of safety, it would make no sense for you to be around that.
CZIQMIr0aa	Uh the only thing I can tell you is - they don't work! So good luck with that!|`|AVz4JS69aa	you're wondering some things about it?

AA11481224	you dont need to lose weight your weight is perfect|`|tlgJrKoRaa	Depends on what type of stuff you are eating. Anyway you sound perfectly ok to me|`|WbUwgMk3aa	if you want to loose weight you should eat approx 2000 calories a day and burn around 500 each time you exercise.    Don't starve yourself though you could do more damage then good|`|al0cCPb6aa	no don't listen to the person that says you need to eat 2,000 calories a day. You are on the right track. Since you're already slim though, it's going to take longer for you to lose weight. The smaller you are the harder it is to lose. In a month you'll probably lose like 5 pounds.|`|081NXWAeaa	wel done, ur perfect weight|`|0qmGvwV1aa	One pound of fat=3500 calories. Eating that many calories is fine but do not go below 1200 calories, otherwise your body will hold onto fat because it thinks that it is being starved. If you normally eat 2200 calories a day and cut it down to 1200 calories at the end of the week you will POSSIBLY lose around 2 lbs per week. It is not really healthy to lose more than 1-2 lbs a week because you do not have that much to lose to begin with. Try to eat 5 small meals throughout the day...just make small little changes---with the food you eat and the total time you exercise---and it will add up in the long run:) Good Luck!
04d06dfa9bbbb62672382e390353acbfaa	It's pretty common for antibiotics to cause yeast infections-- the antibiotics kill the good bacteria in your vagina that keep the yeast from growing. Go to the doctor, he or she can prescribe a pill that will get rid of the infection in one dose.|`|3Phz1nHeaa	Yes the anitbiotic does not know the difference between good and bad bacteria and destroys all of them including the good bacteria that we all have in our girl regions to maintain a healthy balance.  Eat lots of Yougurt that will help.  Also you can go to the pharmacy and get some acidiophilous (sorry not sure if I spelled that right) and take that.  It should clear it up.  Because of this reason it can also cause diareah or loose stool which the yougurt and the pills will help that also.  Just for the future when you take anitibotics take the acidiophilous right away too.|`|d8h5h8IVaa	Antibiotics do cause yeast overgrowth, it is something some women learn, however most Doctors don't tell you, which in my opinion is wrong.    DO NOT buy anything over the counter or take another antibiotic to get rid of it, it will just increase yeast infection risk in the future.    Your very best bet is to go to a local health food store and buy acidophilous bifidius, which is a GOOD bacteria found in natural yogurt. You can get it in pill or chewable wafer form and it needs to be refrigerated to protect the contents.  It is way cheaper, and better for you and most of all it WORKS!  Honestly it is really great and it helps balance your intestinal flora too.    Pop a few pills for a week and you'll feel great, all while promoting internal health.    Look it up online!|`|a1ymHaWAaa	Yes, some anibiotics while treating your infection also kill of bacteria needed for healthy ph balance in your vag*** treat it with your basic cream from pharmacy.For yeast infections.
aX73hS2Daa	I like to use the normal Tampax because they're biodegrable and you can flush the applicators.  But it really depends on your comfort level with inserting and removing them, everyone has their preferences.  My mom likes OB, she doesn't even use an applicator!  I just like the applicator because it keeps my fingers from getting messy.  :)    Honestly, I leave my tampons in for way longer than recommended and I've NEVER had a problem, not with smell or infection.  You'll be fine, like all instructions you can push the limits a lot.    Wait until your tampon is thoroughly soaked before removing it.  You need the menstral blood to lube it up.  If you try to pull it out while it's still somewhat dry it will hurt.  When you pull it out it should be fully soaked and red all over.    The first time I put a tampon in I was just trying it out before I'd ever gotten my period when I was 13.  Man was that a mistake!  You need all the juices in there to make it easier to put in and pull out.  I couldn't get it out because I was so dry and it totally freaked me out!  I got it out eventually though and now I love tampons and would NEVER use a pad again.  :)|`|q52Z4v6Maa	ok..your first mistake was using tampax...trust me playtex sport is the best brand out there, the plastic applicator is soo much easier and they are comfortable going in and out...plus you can flush it down the toilet! not the applicator but the blood soaked tampon can be flushed...and it hardly ever leaks|`|UKYDpztQaa	platex is wayyyy more comfortable than tampax. especially when you first start. tampax opens wide and playtex opens like "360" as they say. sort of like a flower (thas the only thing i can think to compare it to i guess) so it comes out easier.|`|6gsAWvz1aa	tampaxs have both a good side and a bad side. they are made of degradeable material, so you can flush them down the toilet, but, tampax has been known to cause (not directly i think) toxic shock syndrome. i would personally recommend carefree slim... they are easy to insert and remove because of the size and the silk cover, but i would not recommend flushing them down the toilet.|`|chOS6EO0aa	I use pads, because I think that stuff should leave the body. I have tried tampons, and I prefer playtex,it was easier to use.|`|XuE3fCPXaa	playtex sport all tha way
YCICrIKyaa	Sounds like Rosacea ... but I don't think it is a major problem on your face.. I have seen it much much worse. Being as it is your face, you see it more than others do though!    Here's a link about it   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea    I'd give you a link for some medication directed towards it but I think you should research it and find the cheapest product. Not everything expensive works better.|`|NCl7B7diaa	Yes it does sound like Rosacea and seeing as it's on the cheeks, most likely is.  You can use green concealors to camolouge the area.  sounds weird but you would put it under your foundation.  Contact your dermatologist if it's really a bother to you. good luck
y8HyP1bzaa	All of that is completely normal!  If the white bumps are what I think you're talking about, like... just a part of the texture of the inner labia, that's normal.  Especially if they don't itch, I'm assuming that the bumps you are noticing are just the natural texture of the inner labia.    Your outer labia are the same texture as your normal skin.  So that's why they're not pink.  It's also 100% normal for your inner labia to hang below your outer ones.  "Shriveling" is also normal.    Don't worry!|`|I40iBJdHaa	COMPLETELY NORMAL!   my one inner lip hangs lower than my outer ones. my inner lips are pink and brownish in some places, and yes, sorta shriveled!   the white dots you speak of, it looks like raw chicken skin right? totally normal. you have a totally normal vagina.  and just to let you know, i have never ever had any guy say anything about it.|`|cLVZT3ASaa	You sound perfectly normal. It's kinda like guys pintus...they come in all shapes, color and sizes.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	My girlfriends are like yours.  I never thought I would like that (large labia) since my previous gilrs were nice and tidy.  But, you know what, I LIKE IT!!  Bottom line, it's all good, so have fun and enjoy the beautiful body God gave you!!!
HoZYr3bXaa	Giveit some time, otherwise see a dentist!
tsfbV5PPaa	Well, if you keep this up, you might develop full blown anorexia... So I'd talk to someone and instead of eating less and less, try to eat healthier and exercise more.  Talk to a doctor that can help you get healthier and help you lost weight without going overboard or starving yourself.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	There such thing as not eating enough. Try and have 6 small meals a day. Don't obsess so much just stick to the program and eat as healthy as you can.
6gsAWvz1aa	all people are different, but coz the chromozones in our dna is half from our mum and half from our dad, it is most likely that you will get breasts around the same age as your mum did when she was younger. but most females' breasts start to grow approximately one year before they get their periods.|`|0cZfR0RLaa	Everyone's grows at different ages, my friend is 12 and hers a like fully formed. my other friend's are like flat chested.  Though I did notice that the taller you are, the younger your titties start to grow.|`|r3mFOMmgaa	Ugh, I'm the same age and I've always had small boobs, too.

5TM9P8tsaa	*You need a new doctor. You have a UTI-urinary tract infection. You need to go to ER asap. You need to be on some meds. Or you can go to the pharmacy and they can show you some OTC meds for bladder infections. It will make your peepee turn orange. This is normal. I cured my UTI in 5 days with no damage.

Stress is the culprit for illness,mental and physical|`|6NZeItMAaa	Stress has been linked to every disease known to man, including heart disease and cancer. Clearly, it is not a good idea for people to be under stress. But, as human beings, we are going to experience stressful situations. There is no avoiding this fact. Therefore, in order to really be able to help cure ourselves from being stressed out we need to know how to do the following:    ? Identify stressors that affect our daily lives;  ? Eliminate the stressors of which we can free ourselves;  ? Learn to deal with stressful situations in a healthy way     If you are one of the millions of people who are feeling stressed out, you must take a look at the reasons why you are stressed out and try to do what you can to eliminate as much stress as you can from your life. If you continue to be stressed out you will most likely find yourself taking some sort of prescription drug for one of the above disorders    Try to have positive reactions to stress     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.    You can choose to react to stress in a negative way or in a positive way, it is all up to you. This is the only choice that you have when it comes to most stress.|`|AA11605300	Absolutely. In fact, it's the greatest cause of illness in man.|`|awJcMeWqaa	Absolutely!|`|Run7dyraaa	Absolutely. Stress can cause many things. From hair loss, to digestive problems, to seizures, to panic disorder. The list is endless. Stress can do almost everything to your mind and body. Stress kills.|`|WVbMdohwaa	YES it can. You should take a break and de-stress. You will feel much better.|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	Absolutely. It is a proven scientific fact that stress contributes to physical illness. Studies have been performed on that subject for over 100 years, all with the same results.    Stress not only causes adverse physical effects to people ond most, if not all other animals, but plants as well.|`|XcS2pXOfaa	Actually, yes. Too much stress can cause sickness, rash, and even a heart condition (or something like that, I forgot exactly what =))|`|pFEqHQT3aa	Yes. There are three stages of Stress    Alarm is the first stage. When the threat or stressor is identified or realized, the body's stress response is a state of alarm. During this stage adrenaline will be produced in order to bring about the fight-or-flight response. There is also some activation of the HPA axis, producing cortisol.    Resistance is the second stage. If the stressor persists, it becomes necessary to attempt some means of coping with the stress. Although the body begins to try to adapt to the strains or demands of the environment, the body cannot keep this up indefinitely, so its resources are gradually depleted.    Exhaustion is the third and final stage in the GAS model. At this point, all of the body's resources are eventually depleted and the body is unable to maintain normal function. At this point the initial autonomic nervous system symptoms may reappear (sweating, raised heart rate etc.). If stage three is extended, long term damage may result as the capacity of glands, especially the adrenal gland, and the immune system is exhausted and function is impaired resulting in decompensation.|`|cZ7drQhOaa	Chronic stress, such as job tension or relationship issues, can compromise your body's ability to ward off infection and disease.    Short-term stress activates a "fight-or-flight" physical reaction in your body. This actually increases immune-system activity as your body releases hormones alerting it to defend against possible injury.    But with chronic stress, scientists hypothesize the stressor is never fully removed. That decreases your immune system's ability to react to physical illness. The result? The more stress you experience, the more likely you are to get sick.|`|nVfz6j1naa	Yes...try relaxing a bit cause you don't want to be aching all the time!  I know what you mean though, I've been stressed a lot recently because of exams and I had a doctor's appointment yesterday and told her that I was having stomach aches/back aches/headaches and they said that stress can influence everything.
UhUYJT7Paa	1. When you first get them on, not too much, but later that day or the next day it does the most.   2. Once again, not at first, its pretty easy process, but a little after they may get sore.   3. Solid food as long as its soft enough is fine right away. I had a buger right after I got them on, but later that day only had yogert and mac and cheese.   4. You can chew gum pretty easily, but I was never much of a gum chewer so wasn't a problem for me  5. dots are pretty annoying to eat in general, so even more so with braces. Any kind of really chewy candy is a pain. Also soft bread is annoying, it gets stuck and yeah.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Getting them on is not a problem. But believe me, when they are on they will HURT until your teeth move. Then you go back and get them tightened again and start the process all over.    1. No  2. Kinda, the ortho rips the brackets off your teeth.  3. For me it was 12 hours, so the "cement" dries  4. Yes, but brush your teeth to get it off the braces  5. Anything that is hard or chewy, no skittles, gummy bears, or hard candy|`|XyhQpsvaaa	1. no  2. a bit  3. llike right after  4. yes every one dose  5. umm.... i ate everything but apples!    good luck!   there not that bad really!|`|6uzhVE0aaa	1. For some people  2. Slightly, feels funny though, cause your used to them being there  3. Couple hours only, its not bad, just eat before it   4. No, do not chew gum, it can get stuck in the braces, eat a mint of something.   5. All sorts of gummy candies, its pretty easy to follow through the instructions, just dont eat candy or popcorn or any of that junk food.|`|wvL1PZVzaa	1. Nope. A couple of hours later you will start feeling the PAIN.  2. Nope.  3. I don't know but I remember it was one heck of a long time. You can eat solid food but I don't think you would want to chew the day you got your braces on becuase they hurt like hell. I ate porridge for a wicked long time.  4. They recommend you not chew but I did. They're afraid it will get stuck to your braces and then they fall off. Just be careful if you do chew.   5. Avoid the chewy and sticky kind as they can cause damage to your braces.     They will explain everything to you when you get there.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Ok it does hurt a bit when they first put them on but not nearly as much as when they take them off but thats it. They dont hurt too much whilst they are on.  I would avoid chewing gum, toffee, caramel, anything like this. It just gets stuck to the braces and is gross to clean off especially if your orthodonist spots it first! I dont remember not eating any solid food after I had mine put on. It might be a little sore if it was something very tough. I would stick to softer foods for first few days.   Hope I havent put you off getting them, you will be happy once you see the results when they come off tho.    Mellissa H- Chewing gum is going to have the same texture and just as likely to stick to your braces regardless of whether it is sugar free or not!|`|SLeX0gGaaa	1. No (but boring)  2. Unsure,  3. Like a couple days when it stops throbbing  4. They say your not suppose to but like 99.9% of people do, it doesn't do much just loosens the wire a little.  5. Well you can eat any candy really just don't bite. Although they say avoid candy but yeah.|`|U0U4qRK7aa	i HAVE braces..    I'm getting braces soon, and I have a few questions-    1. Does it hurt getting them on? no but its a tad bit uncomfortable because they put a mouth stretcher in and you feel like a gopher.  2. Does it hurt getting them off?no.  3. How long afterwards can you eat solid food? after you get them off? forever..  4. Can you still chew gum? as long as its sugarless  5. What candy should you avoid while wearing the,? popcorn, chewy candy, soda, caramel, etc. They give you a list of what you can and cannot eat.  After you get them on and your teeth start moving your teeth hurt A LOT for the next few days..|`|TJMdmhckaa	It hurts the after you get them on a little but not too much  it doesn't hurt getting them off  you can eat solid foods like within a day or two  you shouldn't still eat gum but some people still do  avoid all sticky foods|`|CIf13LNbaa	1) it dont hurt getting them of but you can only get them of by seeing a dentist  2)No it dosent hurt getting them on no way!   3)24 Hours  4)you cant chew gum but you can sometime  5) Like hard mints and hard sweets crisps r ok|`|npvl9mP0aa	1. YES  2. Sort of a relieving feeling  3. About a four days  4. I did and it didn't hurt my braces  5. hard candy that you usually suck on (and ice)|`|6IxJPUh3aa	1. Does it hurt getting them on?  Nope, its like pushing your teeth with your thumb.    2. Does it hurt getting them off?  A little bit, its a quick yanking motion.    3. How long afterwards can you eat solid food?  Actually, it depends on how tight your braces are and how much they hurt. If you can take it, you should be able to eat right after you've had them on, but if your braces are really tight, then you may want to start with soup. :)    4. Can you still chew gum?  Yup.. but no Bubbliscious to be on the safe side.     5. What candy should you avoid while wearing the,?  CARAMEL. Caramel for sure! The little cube mutherfothers will get stuck for sure. And taffee too, like Airheads.|`|kRWyH2h2aa	I had braces for 2 and a half years, and it was like 6 years ago but I will try to remember. I don't think it hurt that bad getting them on but you mouth is so sore afterwards, and it took a couple days to be able to get solid foods. When you get them off, they have to scrape it, so that kind of hurt. I still chewed gum, they say not to but I did. Every month after you get them tightened, they are really sore and I couldn't eat solid foods for a day or so. You shouldn't bite down on mints or ice or stuff hard because it can slip and break off a bracket. I did that a lot. But good luck and it hurts but you will get though it.|`|UDX3qgy5aa	1. Not at the time, but once they start putting pressure on your teeth, it begins to hurt a bit.  Take some painkillers that should help  2. Slightly uncomfortable but nothinf else  3. Whenever you feel like it  4. Yes but its slightly more difficult  5. There are no specifics, but toffee gets stuck and can break them. Boiled sweets also can break them|`|MmugX89aaa	it hurts at first.  and avoid chewing gum or hard candy.  doesnt hurt getting them off|`|tYZZcFIyaa	1) no  2) no  3) you are not supposed to, but I started right away.  4) i did, and so do al the people i know who have braces.  5) jolly ranchers. sometimes they stick mercilessly|`|nvTQkc3zaa	1) no. the tightening hurts for a day or two but then it goes away  2) they pull, but its not all that bad.   3) right away. at least when you get hungry  4) i did. and my teeth turned out fine. i think i actually chewed more gum when i had braces then before i did...  5) taffy sucks bigtime. but besides that, i ate everything.|`|3JBOdQmtaa	1. No, it just tastes bad  2. Not really, it just feels weird  3. About a day, but it will hurt when you eat for a few weeks  4. Yes, but sugarless is the best   5. Carmels
sfJp4QNJaa	No but thingy female singer does.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=0JbieSOsMI...|`|AZcohhItaa	yes|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	no i have a fourth one:D|`|ozexBuZ3aa	i dont, how can you? ^o)|`|HRUkmBBxaa	interesting !   no lol|`|r8rykCkGaa	No, never heard of that---sounds really strange to me!  Where would the third nipple go?
AA11943537	As long as sex isn't causing you any physical pain - then I would go talk to a therapist.  If it does hurt then you might want to talk to a doctor too.      Good luck!|`|VbCs0vGjaa	Have you ever had a bad experience with sex?  Maybe even abused at some stage?    If you have, this could be why, you connect sex with the bad thing that happened.    If not, maybe its your hormones....(see doc.)...check your other answers    good luck  x|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I feel very sorry for you, can you think of any reason at all that may have a bearing on this. Are your family very religious? where you brought up believing that 'nice' girls do not enjoy sex? and the obvious question have you ever been forced or pressured into sex by someone when you either did not want to do it or you were not really ready for it?. Believe it or not with women the biggest sex organ is the brain, if you think you are not going to like it you will not. Try to replace the negative thoughts with positive ones fantaise a bit before you and your husband next have sex. How about suggesting that you have an evening of pampering each other no penetration but lots of kisses hugs and cuddles, massage one another explore each others bodies find out where you liked to be touched and how? I do think you really need to find the cause of this problem and talk about it to someone because I feel if you don't it may come back and ruin your relationship, I know it  can be embrassing to talk about ( I am extremely shy and even after27 years of marriage i still sometimes find it hard to talk to my husband about the subject and it is still an important part of our lives.) Please beleive me sex can be extemely enjoyable I suffer from chronic pain and often do not want to have sex, but i fantaise a bit to get me in the mood and I feel so much better afterwards. Please think about getting some help or if you want to email me and talk some more privately please feel free to do so at any time. Good luck. It might help to try some soft porn written with women in mind if you think you would like that. but I also think you should talk to your hubby before he finds out and gets upset that you have kept this secret from him, it sounds like you care for him deeply and I hope he feels the same way about you and he would like to help you. The Joy of Sex is a book written  to help teach people about sex  that might help you|`|dDQLlVF3aa	Don't worry you're not alone out there, many women experience the same problem, but like you; are too embarrassed to say anything about it. First, i'm glad to see that you are asking what you should do. Secondly there are many reasons for your satisfaction in the bedroom. You should try things like anal, or something a little more kinky to spice up your sex life. See if that helps. If not, try masturbating, find whats right for you, figure out what you like and what turns you on and gets you off, then discuss with your husband that you'd like to try it. You can get "dirty books", book about erotic encounters. See if anything in there turns you on. if you've always had this problem and you've been with more than one man in your  life, then its not the man that is doing something wrong. You just haven't found your groove yet. Relax and "Feel" your body during sex, feel where he's putting in body parts. Try four play or teasing first and get yourself excited then try having sex with him.  I would also recommend reading a book called "The five love laugages" this book will help you see what your missing in your marriage that could effect your sexual health. This booked helped my marriage, actually thats an understatement, its saved my marriage! I wish you the best of luck. And if you need any personal advice on the side not for public display feel free to email me curisouscouple486@yahoo.com i'm always ready to help a woman who's having issues like this. Its just plain not fare!  good luck|`|4ve4By3Taa	Hey there!  Listen, don't worry too much, most people don't know, but if you do some statistical research you'll find that there's a lot of people who experience this. There's  60,000,000 people on the planet who are asexual, and just don't like it.  Part of me is curious if there's something new you can try, if there's anything that turns you on... but you sound like you know yourself enough to know about this. There's tons of things out there that could be a lot of fun, sexual therapy is more and more popular. It also sounds like you're pretty self conscious about the whole thing. Maybe if you change your perspective, you may enjoy it more. View it as a way to spend intimate time with your husband, or get to know him in a way that no one else does.  Good luck, I really hope things look up for you!|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Thats very sad. You could buy a vibrator, and not even a giant phallic one, but a nice clitoral stimulator and when your husbands out, use it. It really helps to experience an orgasm by yourself.     http://www.smittenkittenonline.com/ check this site out for sex toy education    http://www.smittenkittenonline.com/vibra...  and their Vibrators.    Sex is incredible, it should be enjoyed. Also, you could ask him to go down on you or you could look at the kama sutra together. Or try a lot of foreplay... You don't want to lie and fake it, that's never good. Sex is natural, there's nothing to be embarrassed about between you and your husband. Maybe all you need is some proper lube?|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	It sounds like you still love your husband and have a working relationship with him, so I truly encourage you to TALK TO HIM. He's your husband, he should know you better than ANYBODY. Embarrassed or not, it's something you need to talk about, and your husband is a good start. Tell him everything, about how you can't orgasm, and how you didn't want to disappoint him by not enjoying sex.     I have to ask if you've ever been able to have an orgasm by yourself. If you haven't I truly encourage you to explore that. I had this problem with my husband. I was getting more and more frustrated that he couldn't give me an orgasm, but I realized that I didn't even know how to give myself an orgasm! Communicate about sex to make it more pleasurable for you. Tell him exactly what you want. Trust me, communication is the only way to fix this situation. If your husband loves you, he will realize it's a difficult situation and that you don't like talking about it and be sensitive to your needs.     Look online about sexual dysfunction, I found some really helpful articles about enjoying sex without an orgasm (eventually my husband and I did work out that issue and I orgasm with him on occasion, and by myself often), and how to more easily achieve an orgasm, and it let me know I'm not alone. After you try some things and if nothing helps, I really encourage you to talk to a therapist--by yourself at first.     I really hope this helped. Trust me you're not alone. It's a frustrating problem to have, so don't bear that burden all by yourself. Best of luck, please feel free to contact me if you would like further advice about this.      EDIT: Looking at your additional details: Why not NOT have actual sexual intercourse then? During your discussion with your husband, ask him if the two of you could avoid intercourse for a couple of months and explore other ways of getting off! This is actually something that really  helped my husband and I; I had to discontinue hormonal birth control for a few months, so we made the decision to just not have sex since we're not in a place in our lives for a pregnancy, and the intimacy, the fun, and the newness of it all was really helpful! Give HIM more oral sex and he will want to give YOU more oral sex, etc.|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	this sounds like it could be a psychological issue. maybe see someone and talk about it? have you talked about it with a gyno? they could do some testing.|`|suBNmjONaa	i really think you should talk to a doctor or a counselor about this. that is definately the type of thing that will affect your marriage. i hate to be the bearer of bad news but what is a marriage without sexual attraction???|`|D9zGSIvwaa	I don't want to pry but were you previously sexually assaulted in your life? I know that some women who were either love to have sex all the time any time anywhere. And some just don't enjoy it because it reminds them. I think that you should talk to someone a doctor or even a therapist. It could be psychological. But I would also go get checked out by your doctor to make sure that there isn't something wrong down there. If I may make a suggestion during sex stimulate your clitoris and you may get off. I hope this helps.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	Did you masturbate alot? If so, this has caught up with you!|`|kTBPP1KFaa	You need to enjoy it! This is were exploring your own body comes into play. You don't know what "gets you off" so you don't know how to tell them to. Pay attention to your clitoris and just look up stuff on the female anatomy.
bgJzeHIdaa	You might! It is hard to tell though. I missed my period for about three months after the 1st one. Your body might not be ready for the second yet. Just wait it out! The first couple years, your period will come whenever. It is very hard to predict!|`|kTBPP1KFaa	Your discharge will change throughout your period based on where you are in your cycle but it's totally unique to your body. Although, since you just started it could be a now, or a year or so from now. You're cycle probably won't be regular for a couple years so don't fret if you don't get it soon.|`|C5PyVxu8aa	yeah you are going to get it that happens to me when im going to get it|`|rRFiSOxuaa	Sounds like you might.  Being 8 days late for your second ever period is nothing unusual and in many women clear discharge will come first, then turn pink, then red.  Don't panic if you don't start soon (as long as you are not sexually active and can't be pregnant).  Your body is still adjusting to this new phase of your life.

IM3QwSS2aa	instead of a "chaser" go ahead and make the protein drink platable from the get go.    Add fresh fruit, frozen fruit, fruit juices (not artifically sweeten ones), fruit juice concentrates.

bQisGgSsaa	It's not suppose to be yellow, it's suppose to be Clear. When it yellow that means you don't drink enough water.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	there are salts and things in it i guess|`|dCF1UBUsaa	Actually, your urine should be very close to clear, unless you are eating a very high amount of vitamin rich food, or taking a multivitamin. When your urine is darker yellow, it is from waste excreted that is found in less than healthy foods. This is why drinking pop/soda or eating foods with a lot of sugar and coloring makes you pee yellow.|`|OBemKKwoaa	It's just waste, that's the colour it ends up coming out. If you are dehydrated it can appear colourless|`|hAp8Orbvaa	The yellow color in urine is due to chemicals called urobilins. These are the breakdown products of the bile pigment bilirubin. Bilirubin is itself a breakdown product of the heme part of hemoglobin from worn-out red blood cells. Most bilirubin is partly broken down in the liver, stored in the gall bladder, broken down some more in the intestines, and excreted in the feces (its metabolites are what make feces brown), but some remains in the bloodstream to be extracted by the kidneys where, converted to urobilins, it gives urine that familiar yellow tint. (Here is a great diagram of some of these reactions, from the Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical Pathways at  ExPASy.)    These same yellow chemicals also cause the yellow color of jaundice and of bruises, both of which result when more hemoglobin than usual is being broken down and/or the processing of its breakdown products by the liver is not able to keep up.|`|945gMsSZaa	It isn't, it should be colourless if you drink enough water.  The yellow (through to brown) colour appears when the amount of water is reduced and the concentration of urea is too high.    The old rule of thumb is - 'If you p*ss light, you're all right'|`|WclZKLZxaa	Yes, if it was any other colour it would mean your pancreas is not fully breaking down the sugars entering your body.|`|taHcR41jaa	i thought that the more yellow the more dehydrated that you are.|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	Cause you're supposed to pretend its lemonade then drink it|`|3SwJy3B7aa	When its yellow its more of the stuff your body doesnt need and is in need of more fluids, when its clear it means you are hydrated and just have a full bladder|`|TpjGEguEaa	my soul is yellow. and my body produces so much soul, that i urinate soul on a daily basis. and that children, is why pee is yellow.|`|HaUyw4c1aa	When urine is pale it is just because your body doesn't need all the water you have been having but it isnt bad to have pale urine.    When it is yellowish it is concentrated. Full of all the waste your body doesn't need. This is okay unless you have yellow wee about 27 times a day|`|aSvOaAjiaa	We as humans are able to concentrate our urine in response to our hydration status, the colour is merely an indication of it's dilution, in the absence of other factors e.g. blood (dark) bilirubin (yellow).    In a normally hydrated adult urine should be a pale straw colour, too clear = overhydrated, too dark = dehydrated, both are not particularly healthy signs.|`|hpkOeOLyaa	OMG, the amount of people on here that have no idea, some do though. Yellow wee indicates that you are dehydrated and is physically something called urea. Clear p/ss is good pp/ss.|`|4L5ZIT5paa	When it is yellow it means that you aren't drinking enough fluids. It is supposed to be white, yellow is not healthy
Q3hVrlSpaa	You on top of him, doing the work so you know your comfortzone.  or doggy style, lay your head down and the lower hald is up in the air it's more peasure on your but.|`|xNuIOozeaa	be on the bottom and spread your legs as far as they can go, and breath easy, it helps.|`|lgjy1BKUaa	if you're on top, you can control the depth of insertion which will help with the pain.|`|3sSVZ2aCaa	no matter what you do its gonna hurt|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Missionary is good to start.
mF0L5jMNaa	sounds like you are on the road to good habits.  try to eliminate most things "white" from your diet.  pasta, rice, potatoes, cream, ice cream, etc.  substitute these items with whole wheat products.  stop drinking soft drinks and fruit juices.  walk, walk, walk - the best exercise.  good luck.  Oh, try this too;  say to yourself "nothing tastes as good as thin feels".|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	CONSISTENCY!!! Running on the daily, and get rid of all junk food including soda :)|`|l2xVPse2aa	try eating good food not by apples but food like carrots that have considerably more nutrients and take a vitamin every morning and ALWAYS get some sleep at least 8 hours. your body works harder when you sleep then even if you are doing kickboxing.
3yzYUbnYaa	Yea you could go to the doctor and buy a pair of just lenses. They could replace them with your real ones. It would be around 70 to 200 dollars depending on which ones you get.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	I would suggest calling the store.|`|uYF4zOmYaa	I would think so-I've bought frames at one place and had my regular glasses people put the lens in the frames I'd bought so I don't see why not.    As far as the cost, that you'd have to call the place you're having the lens put in and find out.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Hmm! Yeah! I wanted new frames as I stepped on my glasses, the insurance won't let me have new lenses in less than 5 years!!    If you want the lenses in a different pair of frames they have to be sized for those frames! This might mean getting the lenses special ground to fit the other frames. This is slightly expensive.    Be happy with what you have unless you wish to shell out some large bucks.|`|1lewFV8oaa	I think your best bet would be to order an inexpensive pair on the internet that would be made in your prescription.  I suggest checking out zennioptical.  Eyeglasses start at $8.00 and they have plenty of styles that would suit your needs.  I suggest starting your search in the bifocals/progressive lens section because the frames have to be larger in order to add the bifocal.    http://www.zennioptical.com/cart/home.ph...    If you do not have a copy of your prescription, then ask your doctor for it.

Q3hVrlSpaa	Well if you diick is big it might be touching the back of her throat causing gag reflexes. If it's just licking, maybe you might not shave so do that. Or she maybe doesn't like the feel of the diick in her mouth only in her *****...|`|ZncV5gc0aa	sometimes you just need to get in a better position. some positions i can dt in, others i cant, so try doing more than just having her on her knees. turn her on a lot before she starts doing it too.|`|jRdoDu3raa	Do it more till she gets used to it...she should be able to take it all and also lick your "boys" while doing it>>>>|`|XsAZNx2Eaa	your c0ck must stink like off cheese ,i feel sorry for her    does it stink like off cheese|`|mTATgVegaa	some people are just gaggers, and gag at everything...it is probably nothing related to you.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	It sounds like she has some form of psychological fear that causes her to gag whenever she experiences something she doesn't like the taste/feel of. It most likely comes from childhood and she probably won't remember how it happened.  Some women don't like the taste during oral sex on a man, especially the taste of pre-come.   IF she has actually told you that she is willing to give you head, then of course, try flavors to make it more bearable. You can even buy flavored drops from sex shops that last for ages.  Try not moving during oral - let her control how deep you go.    If that doesn't work then she's going to have to seek help with her problem.
UdQ2FCnhaa	Eat higher protein meals and increase fiber. These two things keep your brain thinking it is full. Also eat 5-7 small meals each day. Eat every 2-3 hours and make them high protein low carb meals of the healthy sort IE no fried, high sugar/starch foods.|`|2w1pmTpMaa	Keep yourself hydrated! Aim for eight cups (64 oz.) of liquids per day. By liquids, I mean healthy liquids, like water, seltzer or tea. Stay away from coffee, fruit juice, and sodas. Don't drink diet sodas, either - they have a chemical called aspartame in them that makes you hungrier than you actually are.     Personally, I really enjoy tea. I bought myself a tall mug that holds 16 oz. I fill it up in the morning and drink one mug with breakfast, another on the way to school, another after school, and another at night. It's delicious and healthy!|`|3fnAvOGWaa	eating.ALOTTT
GlP7KECoaa	my friend was anemic once cuz she lost too much blood from her period, look into that
aX73hS2Daa	NO!  You are totally normal.  Many women have this problem... our sexuality is a tough nut to crack.  ;)    I recommend a high-powered vibrator!  Like the Hitachi Magic Wand... it's only for clitoral stimulation, not internal use (I've never come from internal stimulation anyway).  That's how I got my first orgasm when I was 19.  :)    Also sometimes people get all worked up about the end result and forget to relax and just go with the flow... instead of trying to have an orgasm, just enjoy the sensations you're feeling at the moment.    I get easily distracted, so I really have to focus on how everything feels.  I've heard that some girls with ADD can really improve their concentration and thus their sex lives with Adderall or Ritalin.    Good luck, and keep trying!  Oh, and masturbate, masturbate, masturbate... you need to know your own body before you can expect guys to do anything with it!  :)|`|WXpdkbG8aa	No! This is soo common among women and it's a shame because orgasms are AMAZING! It's just a matter of finding what "works for you." The next time you're having sex, try rubbing your clitoris because that's where you have the most nerve endings. You have more nerve sensation in your clitoris than a man has in the head of his penis. You'll have to keep rubbing until you orgasm but when it's over, it's alll worth it. Also, try the girl on top position and move your hips around while the guys penis is inside you. Your clitoris will rub again his groin and cause an orgasm. Good luck!!|`|k5LC3YTtaa	No. you just have sex with them to satisfy them that's all. Stop worrying about having an orgasm, go to college instead.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	Nothing is wrong with you. I didn't have my first orgasm with a guy until I was 19 (still 19), so don't worry.    You may not be getting enough foreplay. Or you could just not be in the right position.    Try girl on top, or if your on your back, try rubbing your clitoris while having sex.    Good luck!|`|nVQqTPIFaa	Nothin' wrong with you. They're just not taking the time to pleasure you.
6UATnt3laa	I can tell you what it was like for me.  My therapist brought me into his office and said the typical stuff, hello, how are you? He said he needed to ask me some questions, and that if I wasn't comfortable answering I didn't have to, but that he hoped I'd trust him.  He asked me things like, do I have a boyfriend or girlfriend, have I ever hurt myself, do I get along with my family.  Just questions to get to know you and also for the insurance company.  He asked a few awkward ones, like am I sexually active, and I said I wasn't comfortable answering, and he moved on.  I don't know about other therapists, and I'm sure it has a lot to do with age, but my therapist can't tell anyone about my cutting.  I can come in and say I want to kill myself, and he won't tell anyone, but if I came in and said I have a plan to kill myself, he's forced to tell.  He asks to see my cuts to monitor it, and if/when it gets out of control, then he'll have to tell.  Just calm down and relax as much as you can.  The therapist understands that you will be nervous, and he/she will try to ease your discomfort.  Be as honest as you can because this person is there to help you and is on your side, not your parents or your friends.|`|siXU50bMaa	Well dont worry.  Just say that- you are worried about your parents finding out.  I have the same issue, and its all confidential.  Before you start anything, ask the doctor to reassure you of that.      You dont need to know what to talk about.  Say that too.  Say you are nervous.  She will ask questions and guide you along.     She will probably start with hi, how are you.  I always answer with "alright."  She might ask what your main issue us, and you can saw that you haven't been feeling so great, real down lately.  She will ask questions and help.  She might ask you how you get along with your family, or your friends, how classes are going, if you are sleeping or eating, that sort of stuff.  She might ask your favorite subject, what you like to do after school.      All you have to do is say that you are nervous about talking. You dont have to tell her everything at once.  She will expect you to be honest with her, but that doesn't mean you have to pour your soul out to her on the first day.      let me know if you have more questions|`|iybezfi6aa	You will probably just talk and maybe set some short-term goals.     ASK! (most people don't) "What do you expect from me?" and the reverse- "What can I expect from you?" This is a good thing you are doing and if caught young, may save you from developing a disorder that truly ruins your life.     I am going to tell you that I started out similarly, but without therapy and ended up diagnosed Borderline. Because of this, I can have no close personal relationships. You are young. Your personality is still forming. Be Proactive in your work and honest. God Bless You.
76nTvO4iaa	First - When is the last time your mother went to the doctor for a physical?  She could be suffering from depression that needs to be treated.  If she hasn't been to the doctor in the last year, make an appointment for her to get checked out.    Are there any clubs she could join?  A lot of areas have seniors social clubs where people can go hang out during the day and socialize.  Some people go every day, others go a couple of times a week.  If there's a program like that go check it out yourself & tell her about it.    How about being a mentor for a child at a school?  A friend of mine's mom (about your mom's age) did that.  She went up a couple times a week and spent time with the child, helping her with her homework, reading practice or something like that.  Check with your local school district to see what they might have that would allow her to help.  Again, check out the program and tell her about it.    Would she like to have a garden to work?  If so, could your husband rototiller up an area for her (when it warms up) and she could do that.  Are the flowerbeds around her mother in laws house landscaped?  Suggest that she make a plan for that and that can be put in this spring.|`|UVdviQMPaa	Your Mom is quite senior and this will be difficult for her. She can think well so let her do as she desires. Some times she can be back home with the memories and some time there. That's twice to people contacts for her but keep trying to love her all the same get the kids to help her clean up and stuff.|`|pFEqHQT3aa	May be you and your mother need a psychologist.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Can you get someone to come in and be a companion to her? She needs mental stimulation and a purpose in life. Does she cook, sew, knit, read? Has she had a check up by the doctor? He might be able to help her with diet and perhaps some vitamins and such.    She's probably looking to what she had before because she is afraid of the changes she has gone through but it can't be the same as it was in the good old days.|`|104940ce2da1d781dad2802437961e23aa	perhaps she needs to see a psychologist to help her cope. if that's not the case, maybe she just needs companionship but first ask yourself is she able to take care of all her needs on her own?  If not, have you considered a group home? if it is not time for her to stay in one, then maybe she can visit often so that she can be amongst others her age on a regular basis.Or perhaps visiting a bingo hall. my grandma loves to go out to the city recreation center a couple of days/nights during the week to play bingo with her friends. She meet alot of people there, and she became very close to many. She may be lonely, and this may prove helpful. Or.....What about a pet? Animals can provide an elderly person with loyalty, companionship and love.  We all know the value of having something or someone being dependent on us feeling needed.   Good luck
50f2276bd2afc4e6a063b13972108b04aa	Omg, I couldn't help but laugh because my boyfriend wants to take me paint balling this week with him and his buddies too. Im scared to go but he shouldn't have hit you there. I would have shot the gun to his parts till the gun was out of paint balls and he was crying like a little girl.  Im sorry, I don't think its damaged just hurt. If I guy gets hit down there he usually doesnt damage it so its the same for us but if it doesnt get better in a couple days you should go to the doctor.     SOrry and hope it gets better |`|ZbMLigR3aa	Definitely go to the doctors ASAP hon.  Then make your azz of a boyfriend pay the bill for that and dump him right afterwards.  I hope all turns out okay for you.  Good luck!|`|OGLulBtwaa	Wow, definitely go to the doctor. You should take him back to the paint ball place and shoot him in his penis then break up with him in front of everyone. What a douche.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Probably not permanently damaged. What a jerk though! He has no respect for your body, you should break up with him. You can put an ice pack on it (not directly on it, put a paper towel around it)     Shouldn't need a doctor though.|`|P3GgROxtaa	awe dont break up with ure boyfriend :(  he didnt do it on purpose.  and ure fine, just wait and the pain will  go away and it will be ok|`|33uMw6Qbaa	I would see a doctor.

You can NEVER be TOO safe.|`|D9zGSIvwaa	I would go see a doctor. I don't think that anything serious could have been done. But I would go see a doctor just to be safe. As for your boyfriend I would dump him, it would be one thing to do it accidentally but when they do it to show off in front of their friends then he is too immature. He doesn't care so he isn't worth it. I am sorry this happened and I hope that everything is okay.|`|KvyB0E77aa	Don't worry. The injury will subside. You have some numbness do to the injury which will take a couple of weeks to resolve.  Absolutely, find yourself a more mature boyfriend.

rRFiSOxuaa	Some say you should use condoms for the first month, others say a week.  If it were me, I think I'd fork over the 20 bucks and make sure the guy and the situation are "condom worthy" until my next cycle  ;-)|`|t2LOcPkLaa	it should be working by now. the one i took worked after a week. others will tell you to wait until you've had your first period on the pill. read your directions!|`|64dc285b8d713fd2d2c1b989bf0758a9aa	Didn't your doctor tell you how to use it?  Your birth control packs should also come with instruction sheets inside of them, read these.    You need to take your pills at about the same time every day.  They say that you should use alternative methods to protect yourself for the first month.  So wait until you start your next pack to have sex.|`|xNuIOozeaa	it takes atleast one month, try to give it 2 though|`|Brkk1Tuwaa	Your doctor should have told you before you left the office. Depending on the brand you are on (ie: Ortho Tri Cyclen, Ortho Tricyclen Lo, Yaz, Yasmin, Levlen) your doctor may recommend you use a second type of contraception from anywhere from 7 days - 1 month. I know that the hypoallergenic condoms are definitely expensive, but I assure you they are cheaper than a baby. Unless you are in a monogamous relationship, I highly advise you to use a condom anyways. Since you've decided to protect yourself against pregnancy, I assume you are definitely smart enough to wait for it to "kick in" per se.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	1 month.
TsjqzanQaa	No, the skin on the penis is separate.    With obese males, the fat builds around the penis, and decreases the apparent USABLE  length, not the actual length of the penis, but as there's fat around it, and burying it, it appears to be shorter.    Losing the weight doesn't make the skin on the penis more or less.    If you want more skin on your penis, you can use foreskin restoration, as I'm doing, which uses tugging techniques and devices to put tension on the skin, which allows new skin cells to grow and extend the shaft into a new foreskin, to cover the glans, the way that nature intended.    This vastly enhances sexual sensitivity and also increases orgasmic intensity, as well.    As an infant, the damage I suffered from being mutilated by circumcision resulted in more than the usual loss of sexual sensitivity.  I wasn't able to achieve orgasm in normal sex because of this.  After years, I found out about foreskin restoration, and it takes several years, but the results are well worth it.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|u8CFwtyMaa	If you lose weight from your stomach and abdomen, then more of the penis will be outside the body.  The root of the penis is attached between the legs, and some of it can be hidden by fat.
ecaN5Cb2aa	I understand.   These **** heads are extremely immature and obviously they don't get it.  I always use bracelets, long sleeves and makeup.  Think up excuses if someone happens to see them. Even though it may look obvious people will believe what they want to believe and they certainly won't want to believe you're cutting yourself. I always have excuses for different ones and people believe me.     I really hope that helps  good luck!|`|Z1GS3gMKaa	Well I've been cutting for 6 years.and I have always hid it with bracelets.whether you are a guy or girl bracelets work.I only cut where  the bracelet can cover it.and I went snowboarding for a week with friends and everything went fine.just find something  tight but not too tight that will stay in place&cover it at the same time.trust me I know the feeling you worry about whether or not the cuts are properly hidden b/c you don't want anyone to see them.I hope things get better.Once you realize your an awesome person you wont have to hurt yourself anymore.|`|a2HgB81Haa	There's no point in doing it if you're going to cover it up. Instead of hiding your pain, why not talk to someone?    Try boxing! It relieves stress.|`|LSjvnTxoaa	the best thing to try and do is, help them heal, massage sudacrem into scars and cuts, with in a week or too visability should have decreesed if not gone, but make sure u massage it in really well keep doing it 2 -3 times aday, i did that with some razor cuts on my face i got from a fight, and it left no scars, and they didnt take long at all to heal|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	so you are asking us to enable your dysfuncttion?  sorry, won't do that.|`|3xksQz9haa	Uh, wear long sleeves?    You're going skiing, it shouldn't be that hard to cover.|`|TRrTunqvaa	i guess make up..buttt heyyyy whats cutting doing for you? absolutely nothing. so cut the **** and be a big girl and deal with your problems.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	don't cut yourself don't try to be cool because its not  wear long sleeves|`|0CTsNzTsaa	glad your getting better      aloe vera or some cocoa butter does wonders for scars.  neosporin to help heal the cuts that are fresher.  long sleeves, hoodies.. it really depends where you cut... ive seen a show where some people cut their legs.. so pants on that occasion.   dont worry.. skiing is pretty cold i love snowboarding so you'll be bundled up with a big jacket.|`|1jS20kGdaa	What I do is if you cut on your arm get tight braclets or those cute chunky watches.

Buy some nice long sleeve shirts! If it's your wrists maybe some cool long mittens or if it's your upper arms you can still wear 3/4 length sleeves! So long as your trying to stop don't listen to anybody else! When someone asks for help they obviously need it so people should be more encouraging instead of judgmental, so don't listen to the jerks. Hope this helps!|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	that's what hoodies are for?|`|4L5ZIT5paa	Obviously you are emo if you cut|`|5BBy6G36aa	Use a sweat band. Thats what my friends use.  Or you could just be open about it.  Hope you stop soon~|`|us6s78pWaa	Well, where do you cut? If it's your forearms, just bring a wide range of long-sleeve shirts.|`|kzAgfqhyaa	I heard stopping was a good way to cover the scars|`|20759ce8e8f715cd4d43fc23bca9a608aa	You're improving your cutting? :/    Well, as long as you are cutting less frequently and are trying to stop, then that's good I suppose. I won't call you emo either, because people nowadays throw that term around and label anyone who looks like they fit the description. There are many of us that would probably be called emo, but we don't look like it. I don't like that people use the word emo positively.|`|taHcR41jaa	its good you are getting better :)     use a wrist band .. simple  if your going skiing you will most likely wear gloves and a jumper so it should be fine.       unless you cut your face or something :Z
mimykKnhaa	i've been having sex for 7 years, and every time it STILL is a bit painful in the beginning. Just stick it out though, the pain ebbs very quickly and will be worth it, trust me!|`|X43oNJ9Zaa	it doesn't hurt a lot  it is because the hole has to open   when i had sex for for 1st time it wasn't really painful|`|8qVkSA4jaa	When I first had sex, it hurt a bit, but it was pleasurable at the same time. It wasn't unbearable.    It hurts because your hymen is tearing and you've most likely never had anything that big penetrating your vagina.    If it is unbearable, just tell him it hurts.|`|NE96fU9vaa	yes, the first time may hurt, get to know youre own body and how to pleasure yourself, cause most young men are all about what makes them feel good and you are left to fend for yourself, now when you get into a long term relatioship, you can teach youre fellow what pleases you, and make him wait for you.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Screw not wanting to offend him, if you're in pain then stop!!  Yes it does hurt, because you have a thin flap of skin known as a hymen that covers the entrance to your vagina. During sex, his penis rips it, which is normally painful for most girls and bleeds.  Sex can hurt the first few times because your vaginal canal is not used to being stretched and feeling the friction of something the size of a penis.  The more nervous you are, the more tense you are, which can make sex more painful and sometimes impossible.  Lack of lubrication can make sex burn/sting, because of the rubbing friction.    You won't be having pleasurable sex for a while hun, it takes a while to get used to. So if you do decide to have sex with him and it hurts, tell him so. If he has any respect and love for you then he will stop.  If he finds this offensive, then why bother with him?  Sex means nothing at the end of the day and you should not feel like you have to do it for him.    As always, if you're not ready, don't do it - you will regret it. It's not a nice feeling.   Always use a condom.|`|o4IHt3EAaa	the 1st time the penis enter a vagina it hurt a bit because  the penis are tearing your hymen, after that you will feel very very good and comfortable. ;D|`|Rb10VIAvaa	A little.....Till penis entered fully.Once it get entered pain will over.Actully resion is that virgin vagina is very tight.  You can apply some oil over there for proper lubrication.Otherwise its give you a great pleasure which u never got from any where.|`|8Eyr3FQtaa	it can be painful for the first few times as ur hymen (bit of skin) has to break be as relaxed as u can the more tense u are the more it will hurt no matter how oftenu have sex.   u cud try using a lubricant which will help but remember to use a condom and sum lubricants cnt be used with condoms   and make sure u r ready for sex b4 u get in to it
1dOFZC82aa	Well, a woman's body goes through a very specific order of hormones in her cycle.  First there are hormones that get your ovaries ready to ovulate, and then hormones to signal your body to ovulate, and then after you ovulate progesterone takes over to get your body ready for pregnancy (pro-gestation is what the hormone means).  And then progesterone levels drop, and you get your period and the whole cycle starts all over again.    I'm not familiar with a problem with producing too much progesterone, as usually I hear people having a problem with not producing enough after they ovulate (and so they are likely to have problems getting pregnant, and have irregular periods).  Progesterone usually clears the skin, and keeps your period away, and is not linked with having small breasts.  Estrogen (the hormone that is most prominent before you ovulate) can cause acne, so I suspect you have a problem that is linked to how regularly you ovulate.  And that can mean more than one hormone is out of balance.  Going on the pill will stop you from ovulating, and the pills will dictate when you get your period, so it will definitely make your period happen at a regular time, and is commonly known to help clear skin.  For some people, their breasts will get a little larger - but usually not that noticeably.  So don't expect big boobs from taking the pill.     So it can help you while you are on it, but just remember that it only works while you're on it.  Once you stop taking it your cycle will go back to how was before.    If your doctor wants you to go on the pill then I'm sure it will help you.  Just remember to ask your doctor lots of questions, and be informed. You are the best advocate for your own health.|`|Jvmuri5naa	If you have been for a blood test, then you have obviously been to your doctor... Why not ask them this kind of stuff? I can almost guarantee they will give you a much better answer than any one on here!    Hope this helps. x|`|AA10723498	If you go on the pill, you will get more estrogen in your body.  Yes, your face will clear and it will also aide in filling you out,  Did your doctor say he was going to give you something to stop the high production of progesterone?  Also, the pill will regulate.  Talk to your mom about getting on that pill or talk with your MD.  You'll be fine.|`|SQ39aHSoaa	YES!  to all 3.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	.._,,-~~-,,  ..,- ; ; ;_,,---,,_ ; ;-,.._,,,---,,_  ., ; ; ;,- , , , , , -, ; ;-,,,,---~~~--,,,_..,,-~ ; ; ; ;__;-,  .| ; ; ;, , , , _,,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,_ ,,-~ , , , ;,  ., ; ; -, ,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-, , , , , , ; |  , ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-, , ,- ;,-  .,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;- ;,,-  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;__ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,  ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-: : -, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; _ ; ; ; ; ;,  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;| : : : : : ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-: -, ; ; ;,  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,_: : _,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | : : : : : ; ; ; |  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-,,_ : :,- ; ; ; ;|  ..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,-~ , , , , ,,,-~~-, , , , _ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|  ..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, , , , , , , ,( : : : : , , , ,-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|  .,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, , , , , , , , ,~---~ , , , , , , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  .,- ; _, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,,,--~~~-,,_ , ,_,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,  .,--~,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | ; ; | . . . . . . ,; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,_ ; -,   ., ; ;,-, ; ;, ; ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ;, . . . . ., ;, ; ; ; ;, ; ; ;,-, ; ;, ~--  ,-~ ,--~ , ,- , ,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ~-,,,- ; , ; ; ; ; , ;,- ; , ,-,  .,- ; ; ; ; ;  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,,_ ; ; ; _,- ; ; ; ; ; ;- ; ; ;  ; ;-,  ..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-,  ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|..-,_ ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ,  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,.,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ,  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~-,,,,,--~~~-,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,..,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  | ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,., ; ; ; ; _,,-  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,.~~  ..-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;_,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  ~-,,_ ; ; ; ; _,,,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-  ..| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,-  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-  | ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,___ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-.-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,  .., - ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-.-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,-., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,--, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |  ..| ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  ..| ; ; ; ; ; ; ,..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,  ..| ; ; ; ; ; ;,.,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  ..,_ , ; , ;,., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  ,,,,,|.| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; --,,  ...-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~,,  -,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~-,,  ..-, ; ; ; ; ; ,,_ ; ;-,-,  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; -,__,--.  -, ; ; ;,,-~ , ,|, |  ~-_ , , ,,,_/--|`|HtpRBMFraa	This is something you should discuss with a parent and your DR.|`|5f9hg9craa	Research it please... no need to place on yahoo.|`|8rKXT8sOaa	it happens to some people  uncommnon  it can be fixed by injecting hormones or taking pills to produce more hormones  dont worry :)|`|T7b7tKvraa	well, at 15, you can have an irregular period, and actually, it's just normal.

UnSTw2Zeaa	The previous person speaks the truth. Tramadol is not supposed to be as strong as percocet or vicodin, however I heard the withdrawal from tramadol is really bad. Be careful with what they put you on in pain mgmt. I was told that putting you on a pain patch(only if your pain is constant) is least likely to cause addiction due to the fact that it releases the medicine for you and you do not have the option of taking pills whenever you want. If you increase your patches such as 2 at a time, you have an excellent chance for overdosing. Just make sure your PCP and pain Dr. keep in touch with each other because your PCP knows you best. You also may want to try Physical Therapy, it worked excellent for my back. Anyway, it usually takes a while for a Dr. and the patient to find the right combination of medicines that will work for your pain. If you start to feel like the meds. are not controlling your pain, call your Dr. don't raise the dose yourself. That is where you get into the whole addiction territory. Like the pervious person said, withdrawal symptoms will make you wish you could go back to having the back pain. Hope this helps.  Jennifer|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Never tried that...but Fentynyl patches can help.    If you want something non-narcotic, I suggest Toradol.  It amazed me how well it works, short term.|`|d5RXOfyyaa	The Tramadol isn't going to do a damn thing if the Oxy and Hydro didn't. You need a flatter pain killer like Diluadid or something. These things are hitting to high in the head and in time they will work, but you have to practically be dependant on them too.    Take only as needed and not everyday, physical dependence is hell and once you feel the pain from withdrawing off these things, you will cry for your real back pain.|`|YTjxux3Uaa	well your Doctor had it right the first time. oxycodone can be a very helpful pain reliever.i just cant understand why your Doctor is moving you lower, tramadol wouldn't help nothing. try asking for roxicodone 30 milligram that will definitely help   good luck
g2Ypb2chaa	Nope. Masturbation is pretty much harmless. The only thing it can do to you is exactly what it did to you - make you hungry, thirsty, tired and a little weak for a while.    When you ejaculate, the muscles in your body tense up, and this can tire you out. That's all it is though, unless you have some other condition that it somehow exacerbated (high blood pressure, etc.).|`|u8CFwtyMaa	There are good points and bad points.    The good points:-  It relieves stress, and relaxes you.  It teaches you about your body, and how to reproduce, which is what we are on earth to do.  It's a mild form of exercise, and gently works out the heart.  It is believed to reduce to risk of prostate cancer in later life.  It can help you get off to sleep.  It's good fun - the best fun you can have on your own.  It's sex with the person you love the most.    The bad points:-  You have to clean up afterwards. (but not if you do it in the shower)    Work it out for yourself.  Hope this helps.|`|oaiL6vnuaa	no. well, there really isn't any possible harm to yourself. however, it is quite harmful to kittens. every time you masturbate, the MASTURBATION fairy collects your semen and uses it to drown 7 kittens. so stop playing the skin flute buddy!|`|bZ99fJVdaa	No, none of that is true.

Regular masturbation is actually very beneficial in the sense that it actually relieves a lot of stress and can actually help reduce the risks of getting prostate cancer. it has even been called a good cardiovascular workout by some experts, and certain doctors have been known to recommend it as a workout to people who have cardiovascular disorders. you cant become infertile from masturbating, however some studies suggest that excessive masturbation can lower blood pressure, and sometimes make it go too low. i think there are more risks from masturbating your partner than doing it to yourself, apparently there is a slight chance of spreading STDs that way, but that's not been proved yet.|`|g2mrLqmeaa	Doesn't mess up your body, but it will screw-up your mind, especially if your doing it INSTEAD of having sex when available.

If you were to believe that, then you would never have sex,  because semen come out during sex too.    It does not harm your body, and anybody with a good sex drive does it.    Fatigue and hunger are common after sex, so it's only  natural that these symptoms appear after masturbation.    Go ahead masturbate, it won't kill you, and you'll build up  a bit of endurance, but it will not harm you unless, you do it  to often then maybe the skin of your shaft and such will  get very dry, that's about all i can think of.

That is not to say your problem IS indeed a kidney infection... you really need to get checked by a doc ASAP to be sure.

Up there in our heads we have to remember drugs, dosages, side effects, interactions, have knowledge of diseases and conditions and the possible and proper treatments for them, so we recommend drugs for some minor/common diseases like athletes foot, common colds, etc, then still have some more info to double check the doctors recommendation for your condition (to make sure you're getting the right stuff), then we have to be able to counsel or advise patients on the use of their medication, their condition, answer questions they might have and in some cases do follow up on the patient to ensure they are taking their meds (compliance) and that the therapy/treatment is benefiting them. Also you have to be familiar with how the medication looks, just in case a patient brings in unlabeled/ loose pills.

QYvM7Lrjaa	Heya,    Information regarding the syndrome.. I don't know anyone who has it though..    An autoimmune disorder which causes the body's immune system to attack the glands that produce moisture. Common symptoms are dry eyes, dry mouth, and fatigue. It most heavily strikes women in their late 40's and older, and currently around 4 million Americans are believed to suffer from it. (Exact figures are hard to pin down since it isn't commonly known and is often not diagosed or misdiagnosed as other ailments such as lupus or multiple sclerosis with similar symptoms.)    The cause is still unknown, and while there are treatments for some of the symptoms, there is no cure. It's generally not fatal, but does seriously affect the life of the people who have it, and can have serious complications, which can be life-threatening if not caught and treated in time.    More information, and resources for sufferers, can be found at the website of the Sj?gren's Syndrome Foundation - http://www.sjogrens.com/ (Much of the information for this writeup came from there.)    Good luck..      PS: I found some information regarding someone who has that syndrome:    Coincidentally, both my mother and mother-in-law were diagnosed with Sj?gren's in recent years, and it is the chronic fatigue that has been most noticable. While the symptoms result in habits such as carrying water bottles everywhere, the draining of energy has really slowed down these two previously very active women, and it's very unpredictable as to which days they will be raring to go and which days they'll be completely wiped out.
Txg9giQfaa	One of my friends bought a few of these.  They are a total joke!  Just go to a department store and get a kids play ball, one of those weightless, inflatable rubber ones - it's the exact same thing.    Also, she got ripped off with numerous extra charges on her credit card.  She called the Better Business Bureau and they have heard numerous complaints about this company, so I suggest you totally avoid them!    Your best bet would be to get a medicine ball.  You can workout with those and actually get a benefit, plus they're pretty cheap.|`|4KMSKrxQaa	just buy a dodge ball

WVocjoaraa	I'm sorry hun, but I don't think anyone on here is going to give you an unhealthy way to lose weight. Because, frankly, that is not going to help you. I think most people on answers truly want to help.     There is no quick fix. If you choose an unhealthy way, you are more than likely going to gain any weight you lose right back or continue to lose it in same places. You obviously know the right ways to do it, the only thing I would add is make sure to drink enough water and patience.    There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. Think about it. Take care of yourself and respect yourself. Embrace your shape. Love yourself. Good luck.|`|kNGY4S49aa	Try the master cleanse go to the website|`|PnaE2bWBaa	There are many ways to lose weight I can think of a couple of ways I would use if I were in the same situation.    1. If you mind not eating as much eat more. Eat smaller meals, but a lot of them one every 3 hours or bring a snack with you and continue to munch on it at all times.    2. Exercise if you don't mind your legs getting a bit bigger and stronger running is a great way to lose weight just. You don't even have to really run it. Just slow jog at a steady pace for about a mile a day and you will lose it if your consistent with it.     3. I wouldn't try it but there are many diet pills that suppress appetite if your willing to go to any length diet pills might be a way to go.    4. Illegal drugs, but stay away PLEASE!    I hope this helped I too am trying to lose weight, but can't exercise  because I will gain too much muscle weight
PdBmOPI2aa	Not really, the main reason that people get sick is from contact with other sick individuals. Unless someone near you is sick, you will be perfectly healthy, but very stinky.

7pkxOc6Raa	Make sure you're using properly form. You're supposed to keep your shoulders tucked. Incline bench press is superior and much less injury-prone. You'll be able to do less weight at first, so you probably won't follow my advice because of ego, but if you want to prevent injury, stick with that.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's best to not push the shoulder I have had many shoulder injuries you have to decrease weight until it doesn't hurt and if you can't do it without it hurting you need to stop and give it time to heal. You only make it last longer by re-injuring it which is what you do every time you push with pain.    Just keep doing your flys and switch to dumb bell chest presses since you can adjust the dumb bells to go with it you may be able to still do a little something that way. Too late to ice it it's an old injury you can put heat on it to relax the muscle so it can heal. Don't push it or you just drag it out longer.     I know it's hard to stop been there done that but it's the only way to heal it. Then when you go back in gradually get back up to the weight you were doing before.|`|rfpzdoEwaa	like sumnor said put your shoulder plades in while benching.

Sweetheart there are more things to to be concerned with than losing weight at your age. How did you ever buy into that crap? It's great you want to keep in shape, but not eating isn't the way to go. You will end up very sick or worse! Find other things to do and to occupy your mind with, like your studies, girlfriends and overnight pyjama parties. All you have to do is walk, no more and no less. Is your mother condoning this? You don't have to be thin to be beautiful my dear.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	You're not losing weight because you're going about it stupidly. You eat so little, so your body stores anything you eat, thus, you don't lose weight.

If you're overweight, keep doing what you're doing, and don't give up.

Make sure you're eating a balanced diet, drink lots of water, and keep up the cardio.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Do it the healthy way.  Have 3 meals a day, do not skip a healthy breakfast.  Walk each day, when getting home, about 20 minutes ea. day.  Do not eat between meals, unless it is a fruit/fresh.  Eat very little bread, especially white.  Eat a salad each day.  Do not eat after supper, unless it is fresh fruit.  Don't fool yourself or cheat, it will show greatly.  When serving mashed potatoes or such, 1/2 cup.  Serving vegetables serve 1 whole cup.    Eat smart, low on bread, cut the sugar.  More people say that they do not eat sugar, but they drink soda, sugar in coffee and fancy creams in coffee.    Cut the sweets to a minimum  Drink lots and lots of water, at age 14 also have 1 glasss of 2% milk a day. Do drink milk ea day though.|`|CD5C2nhFaa	Ok, do NOT  stop eating. Without food coming into it, your body goes into "starvation mode," where it stores as much fat as it can. I would talk to your doctor, because he or she will be able to help you determine if you even need to loose weight. Many teens think they need to lose weight when they really don't. However, if it is safe for you to lose some weight, try writing down everything you put in your mouth. If you see "chocolate chip cookie" written on your list three times a day, you will most likely stop eating as many.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Go on a raw diet. Eat only raw fruits and veggies.  Make sure to eat soybeans and other beans for protein.  This is a fast and healthy way to lose weight plus you will feel better.

Be happy with yourself!|`|KVSUTwfGaa	Don't starve yourself!  Exercising is good, but make sure you eat right.  You need to get enough calories in a day.  So breakfast is a must.  So eating 800 calories might seem like it would make you looks weight, but eat healthier and you will lose more.  I saw on Oprah that when you start eating healthier, you'll stop gaining and your body will go in the other direction.  But if you just one day start eating less, you will probably gain in the beginning.|`|skWN7jWHaa	your body is not working for you because your starving it eat at least 1500 calories and exercise otherwise if you lose anything on your current diet it will be lean tissue not fat!  good luck|`|YC3iLdKMaa	800 Calories are too little.  You just end up in starvation mode, and slows your metabolism down. If your metabolism is low, even if you eat less, you gain the same amount of fat as you do when you eat your normal meal when you eat.  I guess 14 is a young age to start losing weight.  I'm 14 as well, and I just recently started eating 5-6 small meals a day to boost my metabolism. I think it's way better than 3 big meals that makes your belly full; You should eat way more than 800 calories. You should at least consume 1200+, although it depends on your weight.     Try eating low-fat and low-calories foods, or whole wheat. Also, drink lots of water because water helps you burn fat!|`|dLRquZ3Kaa	1.

But, going on crash diets are just going to make you hungry, angry, and you'll definitely gain the weight back. Last summer I went on a diet and I lost about 60 pounds in 3 months and trust me, I gained every pound of that weight back in less than a month. You should just lose weight as healthy as possible because crash diets will not work, plus you'll lose your hair (like I was beginning to do).|`|FOpR2Cwzaa	Not eating is the WORST thing you can do!  It will slow down your metabolism and possibly put your body into starvation mode.  You should eat three modest, healthy meals a day (watch your portions!) with 2 healthy snacks inbetween.  If you want to drop pounds, CARDIO, CARDIO, CARDIO!!  You should be doing cardio at least 3 to 5 times per week, for 30 minutes to an hour each time.  Try running outside, rather than on a treadmill.  This way, you don't get bored and you tend to push yourself a little harder.  If running is not for you, try riding a bike or getting on the elliptical machines.  Try listening to music while you work out with songs that keep you energized and motivated.  Be patient and stick to your plan!  Sometimes when people aren't seeing results instantly, they get frustrated and give up.  Don't do this!  Consider what you're eating, also!  Stay away from fast foods, and foods high in sugar, fat, and caffeine.  Carbs are good for you, but learn the difference between good and bad carbs.  Make sure you eat plenty of veggies and drink lots of water!  I would suggest signing up at a gym and seeing a trainer.  They can help you with a lot!  Maybe even talk to one of the coaches or trainers at your school, since use of the gym at school is free.  I'm sure the coaches will be more than happy to help you!  Good luck!|`|WqmnQNp6aa	Kate, the best and most effective way to reach and maintain your ideal weight is to EAT whole grains, fresh fruits/veggies, beans, and a few nuts.  Eat food that is unprocessed.  Example:  whole wheat pasta = good, Captain Crunch = bad.  A peach = good, peach yogurt = bad.  If a food has more than just a few, few ingredients DO NOT EAT IT.   Whole, natural foods, with all their fibers, water, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc. intact is what your body is CRAVING. Your body only has one way to ask for nutrients, it will say that it is hungry.  Quit ripping it off by eating empty calories - Example:  ramen noodles, potato chips, soda.  Give it the natural food it was meant to have.     I promise that if you eat as I suggest for one month, you will look and feel so good that you will never want to go back to see the Clown or the King, or ring the Bell again.  Whole, natural foods fill you up and keep you full until the next meal.  They put the ki-bash on processed foods!    Incorporate some fun exercise into the mix - walking and talking with a friend, shooting hoops in the backyard, taking your bike for a spin around the block, helping your mom do some "extreme housework", etc.  Make exercise fun though, or you won't keep it up.    Kate, you are young and have your whole life ahead of you.  Eat right so that you can get the full 82 years you have coming to you.   :)|`|l2xVPse2aa	Atkins i lost 100 lb in 3 months eating as much as i want but make sure you have discipline. it is a diet where u don't eat any ANY ANY carbs (sugars and such) but you have to do a couple of things to lose that much weight. 1 stick to it. no cheating. 2 take vitamins, many foods with 0 carbs have no vitamins. 3 exercise only 5 minutes a day got my results and i have more muscle than ever. 4 don't deprive your self or you will gain more weight than you started with and your body will literally eat itself causing more fat %. 5 an final thing when leaving the diet you have 2 options, A) create one cheat day for yourself and indulge in whatever you want but for the rest of the week stick to no carbs. you will gain 6 lb that day but though the rest of the week lose 6  B) have one carb a day for a week then 3 then 5 then 8 and keep going into a regular diet slowly. for more info buy a book about it. this is just something brief on how to diet on this method.

Don't go up band sizes unless you've put on significant weight around your back/torso.|`|SjfC29fmaa	i think you should go to victoria secrets or madeinform or something and have them measure you they'll know your exact size|`|fk8wXA3Saa	I would have to see a pic to be sure !|`|HsZp3pSKaa	what about a 34B then?|`|DuPAkdkxaa	i have the exact same problem! i just bought a new bra and i noticed i'm really busting out of it lol. go try some on! or be measured. remember though, it depends on the brand and style. also i have been wearing 34B's and the 34 was too large, so i got a 32 and the band fit perfect but the cup size was tight, so i might be a C.. anyway, try this : if you're wearing an underwire bra, press down on the wire thats under your bust. if it feels softish, you probably need a bigger cup size. if you feel your rib cage, then it's the right size. good luck!!!|`|04d06dfa9bbbb62672382e390353acbfaa	If you go to Victoria's Secret or even some department stores, they can measure you and tell you what size you are. Also, the smaller the band, the bigger cup size you will need- ie, the cups on a 32B and a 30C are roughly the same size. If you get fitted for a bra at a store, you have no obligation to buy one there, but you will find out what bras fit. It's always a good idea to try one on first.|`|529yXHW9aa	go to da stoere and measure or u can measure ur self
52Vmf8Toaa	Ah i love a pull up bar- the perfect exercise tool!   Ok, i'm not sure how strong you are or anything, but this is what i would usually do with a pull up bar.    start standard: underhand grip. remember, with all these exercises, take it nice and slow, pull yourself up so your chest hits the bar, not your head.     overhand grip- a little harder, makes your biceps work more, but good once you perfect it.    wide grip- great for working your lats and biceps, grap the bar about twice of shoulder length, and pull yourself up, remembering still to get your chest to touch that bar!    mix these exercises up, do about 15-20 reps and about 4-5 sets, when you feel yourself getting better and able to do more, then either do more reps, or add a weights belt and make it a bit harder!

CHiEKZrLaa	She would have been palpating (feeling) your Thyroid gland... and she likely asked about Grave's disease or Hashimoto's disease (both are thyroid conditions that can cause enlargement of the gland.)    Don't be scared... it's very thorough of your doc to be palpating the thyroid (many don't)!  She's sent you for blood tests to see if your thyroid hormone levels are okay.  If the hormone levels are abnormal, she may prescribe something to help bring them into balance again.  There may be some follow-up tests, including a thyroid scan, depending on what your doc felt in her exam.  She'll be ruling out more serious conditions.    The good news is that thyroid conditions are pretty much all treatable and relatively easily managed (most likely with meds, but relatively rare cases require surgical intervention.)  Either way, because your very astute (on-the-ball) doc caught it early, your prognosis (outcome) is likely to be excellent!|`|rRFiSOxuaa	Gosh!  I hate how doctors are too busy to explain anything these days and just give you a lab slip.  Then you go on the internet and scare yourself silly with all kinds of terrible possibilities that the doctor probably isn't even considering.    Could it have been your Thyroid she felt was a bit enlarged?  Or maybe a lymph node? Most thyroid conditions are easily treatable with medication. Similarly a swollen lymph node can be just an infection you take antibiotics for.  I know it's hard, but try not to worry waiting for the tests to come back, you're probably fine.|`|lgjy1BKUaa	It is probably justwollen glands which is very common with Epstein barr virus also know as Mono. It's nothing to worry about and it is very common (I had it) After the blood work (don't worry it won't hurt bad) they will probably confirm that and recommend rest and maybe some antibiotics. Good luck and don't get upset about it! =)|`|33uMw6Qbaa	Sounds like Mononucleosis or better known as mono. I just had it. Its a horrible sore throat, headaches, and you can barely eat anything  because it hurts so badly.|`|KeHC9hjlaa	Do you have a hoarse voice or cold like symptoms? It could be something like tonsilitis or glandular fever, the latter being most likely if you need blood taken to confirm it. A blood test can be used to check your white blood cell count, which is a measure of how many cells you have trying to fight infection. It may just be that your doctor needs to confirm an infection is there before making any further judgements.  I had infected glands last year and they stood out of my neck like golf balls. It may be that you have something similar which is the size reference your doc has mentioned. Bear in mind some glands cant be felt until certain pressures are put on them like swallowing.  Dont worry excessively about things because if you do have an infection or something else it wont make it any better. Your doc has done the right thing by requesting further tests|`|KvyB0E77aa	an enlarged thyroid gland could be what you have. It is called a goiter. It really is nothing to worry about.

9f91ea6af16ad24be779d308f11720cdaa	It's when a man realizes that he hasn't achieved, accomplished or attained all or even most of the goals we set when we we young.  It's when we come to realize that we came up short on reaching our potential, our expectations (and those of others) that we were certain we would realize through out our lives.    It is much more punishing and devastating than female menopause.....|`|UtYOwE4Laa	it's what my dad's going through, he can't stop watching animals mating on the discovery channel.|`|XxRKLyqLaa	Irritable Male Syndrome.  he Irritable Male Syndrome (IMS) is a recently-coined term for a set of symptoms thought to be caused by a drop in testosterone levels in male mammals. It is a striking feature in male seasonally breeding mammals associated with the end of the mating season. These symptoms are similar to those of the so-called male menopause (also known as viropause or andropause).    In humans IMS is defined as involving the hormonal, physiological, and chemical changes that occur in all men generally between the ages of 40 and 55, though it can occur as early as 35 or as late as 65. These changes are considered to affect hormonal, physical, psychological, interpersonal, sexual, and nutritional aspects of men's health.    One of the most consistent symptoms is anger and sullen withdrawal present in men between the ages of 40 and 60.[1]
oluzjSgjaa	sounds like you are ovulating.   so long as no sperm went inside your vagina during your other activities, you should be ok.  im sure it will all return to normal soon.
EkZDP3Oyaa	It will take a while to get used to and your body will go through hormonal changes that make you feel different, you may even have morning sickness.  I've switched 3 times with my birth control, the first gave me migraines, the second made me feel like **** for too long, and the last one finally worked.  Your doctor will find one that they think will work for your body but it will take some adjusting to.  If you think you need a different one go tell your doctor, but wait at least three months for your body to fully adjust.  And it made the acne I had go away, I only get a few pimples here and there now.  And my stepsister who was the pizza face of the family had her's almost completely go away.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	I started taking the pill 2 years ago, not for acne but for the birth control aspect. I started on the 28 day cycle ( 3 weeks of active pills/1 week of inactive pills) as opposed to the 11 weeks active/1 week inactive pills. I started in early January of 07 and by February my skin was looking better. As long as I was on the 28day pills, I was good. This past summer I wanted to try the Seasonale (11week/1 week) and it didn't work for me. I had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and my skin started breaking out with pimples. I was on seasonale a total of about a month and a half and when I changed back to the standard 28 day pills, my skin started clearing up again.  I'm overall quite happy with it!    Fair warning... when I FIRST BEGAN the pills, I was constantly hungry. My body was adjusting to the hormones and I'd be ravenously hungry, I'd eat, and I'd be starving a couple hours later. It only lasted a couple of weeks and I was conscious to eat healthier foods so I didn't gain more than a pound or two.     But again, the upside is the clearer skin and always knowing when you'll get your period - no unpleasant surprises at school or anything.     I hope this helped!|`|9Sy4Fefdaa	I think the doctor is a better source than any of the hacks on YahooAnswers..|`|xZJZNpIlaa	my girlfriend has and she says its awesome for her skin and it makes it feel better. i have no personal experience but her face is much clearer and smoother than it used to be|`|rt4OnxkYaa	i havnt personally done it but iknow ppl who have... its a good things b/c it balances your hormones (which is what causes ur problems).. and also as a bonus your period will always come at the same time..|`|Pw2e5jezaa	I've been on it for a while, it did clean some up, but about a week before I get my period it will act up a little bit... So I guess it depends on everyone.|`|vOMuBuw4aa	no i do not take a birth control pill|`|ZNPsUAqSaa	The pill does work very well for acne. Also, if you are irregular in your period, you will be put more on track. If you are sexually active, that is another reason to go on the pill. It has a lot of pluses and no negatives, so just try it and see how you react to it.
AA10766729	Just skip your period week of pills and start the next pack right away.  You'll hopefully not have a period at all (but always pack for the worst & hope for the best).

WXpdkbG8aa	They aren't comfortable, but tolerable as you'll need to get one every year starting at age 17, I believe it is now. I have been getting them since I was 12 and while they're not a walk in the park, they're quick. They put a speculum inside your vagina and "crank" it open. It simply makes your opening wider so they can get a few swabs inside. They do about 2 or 3 swabs (one at a time) and pull the speculum out. They will use lube if you're a virgin or if you request it. They will also insert two fingers into your vagina and push on your belly to feel around for any abnormalities. It's a quick procedure and you will feel like you got all worked up for nothing when it's over. The swabs will then be "smeared" onto glass slides and checked under a microscope for different types of cancers. Just take a deep breath and relax! :)|`|LgOOYyXIaa	aww dont be nervous hun  all she's going to do is make you get undressed and put on one of those hospital dresses..  make u lay down and spread your legs  she's going to insert this thingy in you  (it wont hurt too bad i promise! :])  my best advice is to just relax, and don't be embarrassed!  just think, this lady has seen ALOT of ********, your's isn't any different lol  u'll be fine!   good luck hun!|`|973GEZrZaa	thats a period pain, everyone gets them  a pap smear is like something they do in your vagina to check for infections etc :D     xx|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	It's uncomfortable, but it doesn't hurt.

A gentle massage of the leg and foot regularly may help stimulate circulation, as will ensuring warm socks are on during the day, and an occasional soak in warm water with epsom salts.    Other options, of course, include speaking to your healthcare provider (it may be something that can be treated medically), or visiting a holistic practitioner, such as an acupuncturist.    WARM regards for the chilly feet, and hope you can have some success in keeping them toasty!

6NZeItMAaa	Try to have positive reactions to stress     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.    You can choose to react to stress in a negative way or in a positive way, it is all up to you. This is the only choice that you have when it comes to most stress.     Think about a stressful situation that you have in your life at the moment. If you are like most people, you will not have to think for long as most of us have some sort of stress in our lives. Think carefully about the stress. Write it on a piece of paper.    Is this stress something that you can control? Is it something that you can do without? If the stress is something that you can eliminate from your life, why are you not ridding yourself of this stress?    If the stress is something that you cannot control, how are you reacting to the stress? Are your reactions negative or positive?    By choosing to react to your stress in a positive manner, you can not only control your stress, but you will end up eliminating the stress.     Choose to react to your stress in a positive manner instead of in a negative way and you will achieve positive results improving your mind and your life.

Yur welcome to email me at Tizi_luvs_2_dance@hotmail.com  And a back brace isnt that bad! If i havent mentioned it already. :P|`|c68nVKIYaa	46 degrees is moderate, but there is significant probability it could get worse. If it continues to progress, your orthopedists will likely start talking about surgery.     Putting you in a brace is standard procedure while you're still growing. The idea is to slow or stop the curve progression. You'll wear it (and please don't cheat yourself by neglecting instructions) till you stop growing.     In the meantime you can take other measures to prevent the curve from getting worse; you can even improve it. I know a 15-year-old girl who last year wore a brace for several months and has been doing exercises for a year now. She's supervised by a Schroth physiotherapist. She has reduced her curve from 45 to 32 degrees, and it's still getting straighter. Search the web for "Schroth method" to find a therapist -- and good luck to you!|`|8WYWEDOpaa	46 degrees is a fairly major curve.  If you're having pain from those activities, you will probably have stronger pain when your curve increases.  (I'm not telling you this to freak you out.  I've found that its important to be mentally prepared for the surgery.)    I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.    Scoliosis comes mainly in two flavors - functional (the curve is caused by another issue (uneven leg length for example) and structural.  There are two main kinds of structural scoliosis - congenital (present at birth) and idiopathic (unknown cause).  It is important for you to know what kind you have.    If you have functional scoliosis, a chiropractor may be able to help.  Shoe lifts may help with uneven legs, but there can be many causes of functional scoliosis.  I don't have much experience with functional scoliosis.    If you have structural scoliosis, there's not a lot you can do.  The main treatments depend on how bad the curve is and how much more growth you have to go.  Its not possible to predict how much or how fast a curve may increase.    You need to see a scoliosis specialist if you're not doing that already. A doctor that is not trained as a scoliosis specialist doesn't have the expertise to treat it.    Any curve under 10 degrees is considered normal and probably isn't monitored.    Curves from 10-25 degrees are mild but should be monitored, especially if you're still growing.    Curves from 25-40 degrees are moderate with bracing possible. You will need monitoring, especially if you're still growing.    Surgery may be recommended if your curve doesn't respond to bracing. Bracing will do no good if you're through growing. The purpose of a brace isn't to make your curve better, but rather to keep the curve from becoming worse.    Curves greater than 45 degrees is major. Surgery may be recommended. This depends on many things, but whether you're done growing, whether your curve is increasing, whether your heart and lungs are in danger of being squeezed by your curve, whether you're in pain, quality of life, etc.    If your curve is over 30 degrees, there is a good chance that it will increase even when you're through growing.  (Mine did.)    Unfortunately, nothing can *fix* idiopathic scoliosis. Surgery can keep the curve from getting worse, and in most cases, will reduce the curve but most likely your spine won't be straight (unless you are very flexible in the area to be fused, then you might be lucky).    Chiropractors, message therapists, acupuncturists, etc., can't fix idiopathic scoliosis. These people adjust the soft, connective tissues and that may (or may not, you can't tell ahead of time) make you feel better, but remember, idiopathic scoliosis is not a connective tissue disease. Your spine is growing curved.
YwHl37Hgaa	An oily skin , as the name implies, is one in which the sebaceous or oil-producing glands are over active. As surface grease tends to attract dirt, an oily skin acquires a dirty surface film , that needs to be removed daily.

It isn't supposed to. You might consult an orthopedist about this. I'd also try to find a physical therapist who specializes in orthopedic conditions, since they often have a complementary viewpoint to the doctors (particularly dynamic and kinetic versus the static X-ray view).|`|8WYWEDOpaa	Popping your back won't affect whether your curve is stable or increases.

There are many creative ways that you can prepare tomatoes, in your dishes. Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to overcome excessive sweating naturally.
VM6XG5c3aa	Over the counter fat burners, and many diet aids, work by stimulating an increase in the metabolic rate to speed the burning of calories.    They are 'uppers' - chemicals that alter your body. They fix nothing. Will only work while you are taking them and just flat out won't fix what is causing your body to store extra calories in the first place.    When you are hypo, when your hormone levels are too low due to your hormone replacement dose being too low, your metabolic rate will also be low.    Increasing the metabolic rate to a normal level would make weight management easier BUT to do that you need the correct dose of thyroid hormone, a 'fat burner' isn't going to do that.    The key to proper treatment when hypo, so that your body is able to function as it should and YOU can feel 'normal' is to get your thyroid hormone levels optimized.    The first step is to get the proper tests done. Testing TSH alone, which is what far too many docs do, is not going to give you the information that you need. You need to check your thyroid hormone levels and make sure that they are where they need to be. "In normal range" is not good enough.. they need to be at the right levels within their ranges for you to feel well.    Once you have that information then you can concentrate on adjusting your dosage to where it needs to be to get your hormone levels to where they need to be.    Did you know that when you are hypo, with insufficient levels of thyroid hormones (Free T4 and Free T3) that you can actually starve yourself fat? Yep... As a hypo, if you are undereating, you will cause your body to go into starvation mode. In starvation mode the body's number one priority is to turn food into fat. To mainatin fat stores first, provide calories to energy second.    AND    If you are not eating enough, and regularly, you will limit your body's ability to convert thyroid hormone.     Explaining thyroid hormone conversion is lengthy... if you are curious, when you have time... I explain it here: www.thyrophoenix.com/conversion.htm|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I wouldn't recommend anything over the counter for this type of disease.

WguyJfugaa	their could  be many reason why your hair fall outs , one reason for sure your not eating the right  , and your  not taking in food,if  not eating right you should be taking vitiman check with your doctor,  you need to eat lots of whole wheat and oats, milk,red meats,like beef, fish, lots of red green and yellow veges and fruits, certain  diets if not done right can make you lose hair ,stress is also  could be causing  you to lose hair,example my brother and i are both the  almost the same age , we both a managers we both work in the servive business ,  we both have  a  hair ,  he eats better than i do but he have full head of hair that grey , myself i have no grey hair but i don't eat as well as he , i have thinning hair , it depend on howw you eatt andd how you handle stress, another thing that could be a big facter is your  gens you  inherit  from your mother and father, go to a  doctor   to get some blood test ,but a simple blood  test would be able to tell why your hair is falling out ,could be your periods, or hormones inblance,and another thingg a blood  test could show you that you are  lack in iron ,you could be   lacking in   iron because you were eating right,lacking in iron also could be thr reason why your hairr is falling out,the doctor say  my  friend   7 year girl  was losing her  hair also , the doctor say she was lacking in  iron also   and after she start taking iron she   stop losing her hair , it could be  one thing or a combimation of 1 or 2 or 3 thing that you could be losing your  hair, just go and get your  blood test that is the first thing you  should do,than go from their ! if it none of these things than go to a hair specialist,this is  what doctor are for ,to find out what is  wrong with you , than they will tell you and find a way to cure you !  it could as simple as you not  eating right and could just a lack of iron!and he will tell you to take some certian vitimans ,i hope i help you ,take care|`|RZ0lzWJcaa	maybe you are stressed, go to your doctor and he will test you and diagnose you|`|BopBYwSdaa	I just spent 1000US$ with doctor (blood check, thyroid check, sculp head check) and nothing wrong    doctor clinic test (self test method)  PULL your hair... if 2- hairs fall = normal  if fall out over 5-10 = not normal    - couldn't keep food down (that's one cause for sure)  for if you are lossing weight than your body can take...it will fall out  - wash your hair every 3 days better   - DO NOT COMB your hair when wet...nearly dry then comb is best (doctor said so not me...and it work!)  - eat right and maybe get hair/nail suppliment

5T8JZvIgaa	I find it extremely rewarding to combine a free weights workout with cardiovascular exercise. I do 2 to 3 days a week either running or swimming. I use a heart rate monitor and aim to keep my heart rate at about 130-150 bpm. The amount of time doing cardiovascular exercise is a maximum of 45 minutes: following the golden rule of just being able to hold a conversation whilst exercising.     On alternate days, I do weights. These are intense and finished within 20 - 30 minutes. Ive found that too much time spent doing weights can be counter-productive. I do 3 circuits of 10 reps at about 60% of my maximum weight but in general aiming to not be physically able to do a further rep after completing the cycles. Then I rest and do a cycle of 1-2 reps at maximum. Occasionally I cut down the number of reps for the 3 cycles and increase the weight  the thing is to continually keep the body guessing and never let the muscles get used to a set routine.  I do a lot of exercises which use my own body weight such as pull-ups (wide grip, narrow grip, overhand and underhand), press ups etc. in order to achieve a more symmetrical body shape. I regularly (every couple of months) use the facilities at my gym to assess my progress. We have access to blood pressure, body composition, cardiovascular parameter tests etc. I also regularly re-assess my maximum weights for each exercise to ensure Im not giving any muscle group an easy time. I put a lot of thought into my weights routines to ensure every muscle group is included at least four times every fortnight. If youd like to see some examples of my previous workout sheets; just ask.    I was told a long time ago by one of my personal trainers never to do pre-exist stretches. Apparently, there is actually more risk of injury with pre-workout stretching. Instead, I usually do about 5 to10 minutes of gentle exercise on the rowing machine or cross trainer before working out. I usually do stretches after the work out following another 5 to 10 minutes of work on the rower or, more usually, the cross trainer (I have found the cross trainer, for me, gives better results than the rowing machine).       One last point! Probably the MOST important point is diet. Im not as strict as I should be and definitely notice the difference between times when Im being good and times when I let the dietary regime slip.  The golden rules I follow are: drink enough water (3 to 4 litres per day especially during exercise), eating fruit and vegetables, and cutting down on fat (especially animal fat), I keep my alcohol intake low (actually, I think a couple of glasses of red wine a week are beneficial rather than harmful) and I NEVER skip breakfast.   I aim to get adequate protein levels from lean chicken and fish (mainly tuna) and on the whole avoid red meats  although I do eat beef a couple of times a week (grilled and trimmed) as I read that it can help with muscle repair.   On the carbohydrate side, I eat mainly wholemeal pasta and rice with the occasional jacket potato for variety.   Ive thought long and hard about dairy products. There is much research which shows that adequate levels of calcium in the diet help to maintain lean body mass. Since the main source of calcium is from dairy products, I do aim to drink skimmed and semi-skimmed milk each day and usually have yoghurt after working out (along with a banana to provide potassium and carbohydrates).   I have tried various supplements over the years  mainly creatine and whey products. I find creatine makes me stronger and gives me more stamina (I can do more reps and more weight when taking it). I think this is basically just due to increased water uptake by the muscle fibres. Im not too keen on supplements so try to just stick to a good dietary regime. However, during summer, when I want to show off a little I find using creatine and whey powder make a very noticeable difference.    Theres so much detail I havent gone into but I hope this gives you an idea of my current regime. Ive found it works well for me!

To get rid of it faster have your parents help you with     - inhalations (there are plenty of products for that on the market);   - using a Netti Pot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netti_pot);   - eating a healthy diet - including fresh pressed orange-juice and meals with curry and excluding too many milk products while dealing with mucus      Btw... swollowing down mucus is not good.

AA11693263	If the tingly sensations and swelling is concentrated to your pinkie finger, the outer part of your ring finger and palm then you could have damaged the Ulnar nerve. You need to go see your doctor about it because you could require treatment for it. I had to have surgery to move the Ulnar nerve from under my elbow to the side of my arm because the nerve became trapped in the bone of my elbow. Your doctor can order a Nerve Conduction Test and you can find out if it's a permanent problem and if he needs to take any action to correct it. It's not a painful test, just a bit uncomfortable but it doesn't take long and when I had mine done I had the results that same day and 5 days later had the surgery.

If you do not seek treatment, the condition can worsen.  Also, the more you wait, the more likely it is that the damage will be permanent.

bQisGgSsaa	Get CQ to help you stop smoking.  http://www.amazon.com/NicoDerm-CQ-21-STE...|`|dCF1UBUsaa	Smoking and being overweight are 2 of the biggest health killers there are. Smoking constantly for years greatly increases your risk of heart problems, and screws your lungs up, as well as affecting blood flow. Being overweight greatly increases chances of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Either one of these 2 will cause you to have shortness of breath, but you are killing yourself with the double whammy. I highly, highly recommend losing the weight and quitting smoking. You aren't going to be able to lose the weight very effectively with smoking because you won't be able to exercise enough to lose weight without feeling short of breath all the time. At 21 years old, you can still save your health, so do it now. Being 60lbs heavier, when almost all of that weight is fat, is a calling card for a heart attack, as a lot of that fat is visceral fat, which attacks your organs, especially when you are smoking! You need to make a decision: Do you want to get your health back, which may take a year to do, or do you want to keep going this way and die young? I'm pretty worried about your health. Do yourself a favor and seek a doctor's help for quitting smoking, and go to menshealth.com to use The Abs Diet for free, no bs, and join their forums to talk to people to stay motivated and informed while making your lifestyle change.

I think you either have to respect her wishes and not keep discussing your sex life with your friends and colleagues, or expect her to want someone a little more mature.|`|1SHwZDL1aa	no, that is a private thing for some people, and you should respect that.|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	yes, it is very dumb of her, because it shows how much you love and care for her, and furthermore how mature you are(hopefully obvious sarcasm)

Like if your wife is very active, her movements would lull the baby to sleep and when she stops he/she will start moving again.    General rule of thumb is that you should feel at least 10 movements a day. If you do not feel none go to the hospital and get checked out that the baby is still ok.

8mAm5LWmaa	who cares just wash the underwear.|`|AA11785060	Urine doesn't usually show up except maybe as an oily looking stain, and smells like urine.  WHat you describe almost certainly is dried precum, which can leak out anytime. You don't have to get an erection even for some to flow, and you might not even notice it until you go to pee, and there is a drop or too, or a wet spot.  You can also get leakage following sex, whether solo or with a partner-- and leak for a few hours even.    You can leak precum by just thinking about sex, and then doing something else, but your body will still react and produce a drop or two.  Really annoying, and I speak from similiar experience.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	It probably is precum - you don't have to be fully aroused to produce it, I get that sometimes.  I don't think it's dried urine, that tends to soak in, and leave a yellowish stain.|`|ChgfdodPaa	Scratch and sniff

LijKVPUYaa	Unfortunately as you are still a minor, your parents still have the right to know the nature of any medical treatment given to you.  I would also recommend NOT taking your friends BC pills - they may not be suitable for you and could end up doing more harm than good.       As you are 15, I would suggest using condoms rather than relying on the pill, for two reasons.    1) It will protect you against pregnancy  2) It will protect you against STD's     As I live in Scotland and I am assuming you live in America or Canada, I'm not sure if you could walk into a shop and buy them, but I strongly suggest you use condoms even if you can get the pill.    Hope this is helpful
UdQ2FCnhaa	I tell everyone who I train to stay away from any fat burner. These things are crap and can have long term effects that can be dangerous. Ever see these people who have the before and after pictures after taking the claimed product? Guess what? If I took an overweight person who sits on the couch all day and started them on a workout program and changed there eating to healthy with 5-7 small meals per day, they would look just like those extreme photos you see. Just like the P90X BS program and their alleged "muscle confusion" propaganda. This is actually called "cross training" and has been around for years. They just capitalize on people who know nothing about fitness and most are those who never go to a gym in the first place. They give you this workout plan and cut your calories in half.....well no crap, your going to loose weight and tone up after eating 3000 calories a day for 5 years when you cut them in half and exercise........ Chane your eating habits, work out and eat high quality protein meals along with supplemting with protein shakes and you'll be amazed what you look like in only 3 months.

CHiEKZrLaa	Vit D is "fat soluble" which means your body can't get rid of it if you take too much.    We're learning, though, that "too much" is WAY more than we used to think.  It's not uncommon for people to supplement with 1000IU of Vit D/day and particularly for girls/women it's an effective part of preventing osteoporosis when we're older.    The person who said she was taking 400mg/day must have been mistaken... I'm certain it's actually 400IU.  - - IU stands for "international units" and it's a MUCH smaller unit than milligrams (mg).    If you're concerned about taking too much, talk to your doc.  But if you're within the 1000IU range or less, I really wouldnt worry at all.|`|DsFaPP3uaa	I had a liver transplant and my doctors put me on 600mg of Calcium and 400 mg of Vit D and i take a multi vitamin I think you are ok

I'd speed up your rate, and get your balls more used to ejaculating.  Once you get into a sexual relationship, you generally have sex daily anyway, so might as well get in shape. Also keep in mind that semen volume (sperm is only a tiny drop of the semen) is about 1 teaspoon for an adult male, so don't expect cup fulls.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	It can depend on several things, like how long since your last ejaculation, how far through puberty you are, how sexually aroused you are, if you are dehydrated, or if you are stressed out over something.  Most adults produce 1 to 2 teaspoons full, not easy to measure, I know, but try to estimate how much there is.  If it's significantly less than that, then you may need to see a doctor, but you should wait a few years before worrying about it.  Hope this helps.|`|EtbPhdhLaa	nothin to worry bout jake. just maybe not thru puberty yet. don't worry dude, it'll come.

Anorexia is a mental condition, it is a disease.  You cannot make yourself be anorexic.  And why would you want to?  It takes over your mind, destroys your body, and ruins your life.  If you want to lose weight, do it the right way by eating right and exercising.|`|HH56ptnNaa	thats it dont eat|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Be depressed and miserable, ignore your friends, hurt your family, most likely cut yourself because of depression, contemplate suicide, cry and scream hysterically when you gain half a pound, spend hours in the mirror hating yourself, have intense hunger pains, not be able to sleep, be extremely dehydrated, faint, risk seizures and heart attacks, and eventually death...    Don't do it.  If you want to lose weight, message me. I'll help you do it in a healthy way. But becoming anorexic could be the worst mistake you ever make, and in the end, it could kill you.

Please stop insulting people who really have a true eating disorder by being so foolish.  YOU CAN"T MAKE YOURSELF ANOREXIC!  How many times do I have to say this?  Anorexia is a horrible and crippling disease.  Think you want it?  Well I'd gladly let you take mine if it were possible.    Just eat healthy, exercise, stick with it, and you'll be much better off.  If you continue on like this, you'll just end up going on a series of binges, get discouraged, give up, and gain back all the weight plus some.  The only erason why true anorexics don't binge is because we aren't truly in control of how little we eat.  It is human instinct to binge when you restrict like this, and if you don't have a true mental illness, you will end up bingeing.  Guaranteed.
LKqbrHNnaa	No.    The laptop does nothing whatsoever to cause mutation in the cells in your breasts. There was a rumour that mobile phones could cause brain cancer, but there is still no substantial evidence to fully prove that.  The wearing a bra with underwire at the same time makes this rumour even more ridiculous. Tell the kids at school that it doesn't even make any sense!

3VU38jizaa	I am so sorry for your loss and cannot imagine the pain you and your family must be going through. Babies are precious gifts from God and we often wonder why they get taken from us so soon but only God knows those answers.   As for him having shown no prior symptoms, it is not uncommon. Cardiomegaly can be caused by an infection, malnutrition (Possibly the result of a different undiagnosed problem), or abnormalities which can present themselves at birth or shortly after. As for the hypertrophic and restrictive forms, the causes are usually unknown.   Don't dwell on the how and why. Fill your mind with pleasant thoughts and memories of your precious grandson and hold his memory forever in your heart. I leave you with this poem which can offer some comfort in your time of grief....may God bless you and your kin.     A Child Of Mine (To All Parents)  Edgar Guest     I will lend you, for a little time,  A child of mine, He said.  For you to love the while he lives,  And mourn for when he's dead.  It may be six or seven years,  Or twenty-two or three.  But will you, till I call him back,  Take care of him for Me?  He'll bring his charms to gladden you,  And should his stay be brief.  You'll have his lovely memories,  As solace for your grief.  I cannot promise he will stay,  Since all from earth return.  But there are lessons taught down there,  I want this child to learn.  I've looked the wide world over,  In search for teachers true.  And from the throngs that crowd life's lanes,  I have selected you.  Now will you give him all your love,  Nor think the labour vain.  Nor hate me when I come  To take him home again?  I fancied that I heard them say,  'Dear Lord, Thy will be done!'  For all the joys Thy child shall bring,  The risk of grief we'll run.  We'll shelter him with tenderness,  We'll love him while we may,  And for the happiness we've known,  Forever grateful stay.  But should the angels call for him,  Much sooner than we've planned.  We'll brave the bitter grief that comes,  And try to understand.|`|CHiEKZrLaa	First, I'm so sorry for your loss.    Cardiomegaly literally means "enlarged heart."  Without knowing more about your grandson's specific case (esp. his age) I obviouslly cannot give much insight as to what happened medically.  I can tell you that in infants, cardiomegaly is most often related to a "congenital" problem - ie:  something they're born with.    If you speak with the physicians that treated him, they'll be able to explain the diagnosis and give you some understanding as to what, medically, went wrong.  They may also be able to refer you to support groups and/or counselling professionals if you feel like you may need some help dealing with the grief.    Again... so very sorry for your loss.
pujlEZuqaa	who knows why you let this pain go on so long, you need to just simply ask your parents to get you an appointment with the doctor. it could be very simple or very serious and i wouldnt let it go on un attended.
46Ni9IHKaa	It is not normal, i would suggest you go to your Gynecologist and they can do a ultrasound and a uterine biopsy to make sure you have no growths...It is also a sign of menopause.  I have been suffering with this for 5 years now, however, since I am of child bearing age (44) yeah right, the doctos will not do anything....I finally took a sample in to the doctor and she about passed out when I told her that it was a small sample not the regular large clotts....I told here it feels like I'm loosing a piece of my uteris with every period.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I don't think this is normal.  The blood loss is normally very small amounts from all over the uterine lining.  Very controlled and not much from any one spot.  A large clot implies extended, steady bleeding from a blood vessel that should not be involved in this process.  This might be a sign of some abnormal tissue or blood vessel on the surface of your uterus.  I think an visit to the gynecologist for an inspection is called for.  May be very simple to fix.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|y8HyP1bzaa	How large is "huge"?

A lot of girls I thought of as 'pretty' or seemed like they had it all are now not or don't have it as good as they did as kids. As you get older you'll realize none of this matters. Concentrate on yourself and building up your own happiness. x|`|PO9scYa3aa	enjoy not having it i hate myne the cramps nd everything its horrible|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	you'll get yours and once you do you'll wish you never got it. stop trying to rush growing up. everyone develops at different times. some girls don't get their periods until they are 16 and that is still considered normal. i got mine when i was 11 and trust me, it was VERY hard to be the ONLY girl in the 6th grade changing pads and dealing with cramps. just let your body do its own thing.|`|FxBcccS6aa	Uhm i just got mine. Not all that special, it makes you a ****** and its disgusting. So what if the girl got it before you, its not like it makes you beautiful. You will reach your age when you look like her and trust me if she is beautiful now she might not always be.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Unfortunately, life isn't fair. Sounds like you're just developing a little slower. You'll get it soon!     Boyfriends are pointless at 12 anyway. What do they even do with each other? Pass notes?     Think of all the good things you have going for you, never mind your friend. It's really silly to be jealous of other people. You are you and that makes you special.|`|5YYzUgf7aa	your body is different ever ones is your will get it when your body is ready. you should feel lucky having your period sucks big time|`|98WKYtfwaa	You should be happy you've not got yours yet, periods are horrible.    You get period pain, heavy bleeding and lots of symptoms before it like being moody etc. When i had my periods, it felt like i just stopped them then they were starting again.     They really are annoying and i would be happy if i didn't get mines for a few more years. I started mines at 12.|`|P3GgROxtaa	dont be in a rush to start ur period.  their not even cool. i didnt start til i   was 14. it just depends when ur   ready and when u start developing.|`|bgJzeHIdaa	Please do not stres about it! You sound very pretty to me! I am sure you are a beautiful girl who has a lot going for her and you just don't know it! Your period will come when it wants to. Trust me, you don't want it to come too soon because once it comes the 1st time it doesn't go away until menopause! You need to relax and stop worrying. You will start when your body is ready to take that major step. You will have your chance to shine eventually!!|`|8VRaPH3Faa	lol    um, don't get too excited about it. sure, its exciting at first, but your getting it for the rest of your life and it becomes a nuisance.    no reason to be jealous. your just bleeding out of your vagina.|`|kTBPP1KFaa	Believe me, stop trying to grow up too fast. Once you get your period you have to deal with mood swings, oily/pimply face, cramps, and more in some cases. Of course every girl is different and some girls dont have these symptoms but really hun, stay young while you can.|`|Bo6s8j5Gaa	Periods suck..    Just count yourself lucky that you dont get it before her.    They are so much work, you get cramps, it horrible.|`|D9zGSIvwaa	You don't want to start actually it really sucks. When you do start your going to wish you didn't. But anyway I didn't start my first period until I was 15. All my other friends started earlier and I admit that I was jealous at first. But starting late was worth it to me. I didn't get any attention until my junior year of high school (and although I hated who I was getting the attention from) I still loved the attention because there were really pretty girls but for some reason I grew up and everyone noticed me. Just relax and give it time. You are gonna hate it when you have it. But be patient when you do start it might be worth it lol.|`|JxTpCkizaa	i got mine at 11.  its a b*tch.  trust me u dont want it and it can ruin certain plans.  so dont stress bout it.  im sure ur pretty =]|`|lBv1shWWaa	You sound like me 3 years ago. I know it's hard, but seriously THEY SUCK! I begged for mine to come (don't ask) and when they did, i was like: "I waited that long for this bull?!?"    She's really getting punished before you :) hahah
7zBbm8C8aa	punch won't effect
7pkxOc6Raa	Cut the donut.    And what the **** is a curl up.     If you mean curls, doing 75 of them will do absolutely nothing. It won't "tone" because doing high reps won't tone. At the most you will get muscular endurance, which would be worthless, really. Do 10-15. No, you will not grow super man arms, seeing as how you have 30% of the testosterone of guys and it is extremely difficult to actually get big arms.|`|hY0cb2xRaa	You do not eat doughnut at all.. You are not eating any veggies and no fruits.. You need to add that.. Add it between lunch and dinner.. or anytime when you are hungry..     The good thing is you are drinking water.. drink atleast 6-8 glass of water everyday...     Exercise routine looks great.. Add walking or running whichever you are comfortable with..     I think for your weight /height you are just fine.. Just maintain your weight with healthy diet and exercise.. I am same height as you and if I get to where you are I will be on seventh heaven :)|`|Co9I2OMSaa	Very good, keep it up!
0qmGvwV1aa	RUN/do some cardio! or lift weights! the more lean(muscle) mass you have the more calories you burn. You need to be active and be conscious what you eat. The best foods are wheat/whole grains, lean proteins, fruit and lots of vegetables. Just be active and you should be fine.|`|rfpzdoEwaa	Best way to burn fat is to eat right. Another thing is jogging. sit up wont alot burn fat, but build muscle. Swimming is another choice.|`|BzuryYy4aa	Running is a good exercise. Do other workouts for one hour daily. You can do push ups and pull ups. Control food and do not eat junk food.
7pkxOc6Raa	Lol, running is not going to give you much muscle mass at all.     You are extremely skinny, I can't in good conscious help a guy lose weight if he's already under 100 pounds.
Co9I2OMSaa	Try reading or writing, try talking to someone on the phone- you can't eat and talk!  Or maybe you could run outside, exercise in your room, watch your favorite movie, listen to music, stuff like that.  I used to have the same problem but these are some of the things that I did to help.|`|hY0cb2xRaa	try activities that interests you.. keep your mind off the eating|`|NL3lVCSFaa	I have this problem too. What I do is when I get home from school I just have one big substantial meal as soon as I get home, which will make me too full to eat any more. And then maybe hide the food so it's out of sight where you can forget about. You're probably the same as me - if there's a packet of crisps sitting looking at me I'm gonna eat it. So I put it away and forget about it... or munch on it!  Good luck:)|`|c75136fa3cfb0f896f32ff0cd1d36ffcaa	aw that sucks.. i dont think you'll get raped haha. are you allowed to go to like your friends house?    gum saved my life :) haha if you keep chewing it you cant eat! and its not even that expensive!    other than that just try to stay away from the kitchen!|`|GuOJIftAaa	I use to do this all the time when I was bored until I realized how unhealthy it was making me. So now, I chew gum =] It helps a lot too. You should try that.
D9zGSIvwaa	It might be too early to take one. But take one if you want to give yourself some peace-of-mind. If it is negative wait it out and see if your period comes. If it still doesn't test again in about a week or so. If it is negative I would consult a doctor.|`|N1tfEfv0aa	If your period was supposed to come 3 days a go, it is safe to take a test. Remember to use your first morning urine. Good luck.
EertNe9Taa	I would projectile vomit out of my mouth... but that's just me....|`|wIZNsqG1aa	Probably about 40lbs underweight, but your only 20 so give it a couple of years when your metabolism slows you will gain weight, we all do.|`|BopBYwSdaa	that's skinny!    president obama 6'2" weight 185-195lbs and most people agree he look great|`|84fm2GXOaa	your not technically skinny,    im '6"1 and 139 pounds

tjNJAn75aa	Im in my last year of my Implant (implanon). Anti biotics do not affect the effectiveness. Only St Johns Wort does. I didnt have a period for nearly 10 months on implanon but then sometimes I have two a month! My breasts tend to feel very sore before I come on after not having a period for a while so its probably just that and the sickness could be a side effect of the anti biotics. Don't panic but if you are worried i suppose it doesn't hurt to take a test. i asked the doctor when I had it fitted and she said the only thing is St Jonhs Wort.|`|MyjJaoHyaa	I hope not or im F**ked|`|63499b9aac8c6b496fd06a307e032485aa	YES!!!! Mosty antibiotics reduce the effect of your Implanon therefore most instructions would advise you to use extra contraception during that time and for the following 7 days,   trust me,,,am a doctors receptionist!!!!!!!!!|`|hLUxMcKqaa	Trimethoprim is, indeed, one of the antibiotics that interferes with the efficacy oral contraceptives.  Whether or not it would interfere with implanted contraceptive hormones depends on its mechanism of action in relationship to the hormone, i.e., how it interferes with them.  Contact the company and ask:  Annie.tyrie@plymouth.nhs.uk|`|6wR9QkAlaa	Trimethoprim is FRIGGIN EVIL!  It gave me incurable Interstitial Cystitis!  SO ANGRY!   Sorry I didn't answer your question. I saw the word trimethoprime and had a rage blackout.
Kxwyy0Eaaa	It depends on if you are drinking black coffee, coffee with some milk and sugar in it, or one of those gimmicky Starbucks cold things with whipped cream, chocolate, etc.in it.     Also, I don't think that one item, even if it is a 500 calorie, fatty Frappuccino would make somebody fat. Now, if the person is pairing it with one of those oversized muffins for breakfast and having other unhealthy things during the day, then it would contribute.    I drink black coffee. One or two four cup pots a day. I also eat whole, real foods.At six feet, 155 pounds, I'm not fat. Also, even if I did have a "healthy" version of a Frappuccino, it wouldn't have much of an effect.|`|BopBYwSdaa	NO if it's a normal coffee  15 calories in a tea spoon of sugar (so how many spoon you have?)    YES ..can make you fat if it's a starbuck coffee  see chart  http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutritio...    290-360 calories (mocha whipped) same as 1 donut so if you have 3- coffees...then it's the same as having 3-6donuts|`|72MZ0EG7aa	lmfao hell no theres caffine in it hello!  caffine makes u full and takes ur hungry pain away so no.who told u that crap lol?!
0Q7hnUUoaa	No, exercise is one of the best things for your joints.  Honest.  Keep up the running!  = )  It keeps the cushions between your joints "lubricated" so they move together and that wont wear them out.  So there shouldn't be bone on bone action (not healthy), but exercise helps!!!    Good Luck!|`|4bH6L9JSaa	Dunnoooooo (I'm So Sorry For A Crappy Answer - Trying To Get Points!)|`|Mumfvpuzaa	if you are concerned, ask your doctor  if it hurts, stop  otherwise, no reason not to.|`|EXkCsNtRaa	It really depends on your weight and your age if your in your teens- your 30's yes I would recommend that!
1jn3W4wMaa	Yes it will break when you lose your virginity given that you haven't damaged it any any rough activities. I was able to wear tampons for a while without it breaking my hymen, but when I lost my virginity when I got married it broke. Using a tampon is not enough force to cause your hymen to break.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	It's likely that your hymen has already broken through tampon use or other various activities.|`|D9zGSIvwaa	I was able to wear one too. You might have already broken it. I didn't bleed when I had sex for the first time. You won't really know until you do have sex though (I am not saying to go and have sex) when you are ready and you do you will find out.
IaK4SRHpaa	I think smoking is way more addictive than alcohol but it really depends on the person and their family backgrounds.  If someone in their family is an alcoholic then they might be prone to getting hooked on alcohol than other people because of their genetics.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	well you don't smoke one cig and get hooked just like you don't drink one beer and get hooked i think that three things play into it smoking is more accepted, you can smoke and still function like normal, and drinking is not as addicting|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	I think it's because alcohol causes hang overs and rather an overall bad body feeling the next day (depending on how much you drink) Cigarettes on the other hand have addictive substances and have known chemicals in them to make you smoke faster (gun powder to make the cig light and burn quickly) and get addicted quicker. The thing is that regular pipe tobacco, which I will only smoke, isn't addictive.  So I know that they are putting something in those cigarettes to make people get hooked.|`|tsPGVVWcaa	Smoking is very much addictive. They have chemicals in them like nicotine which makes addictive. Most people drink alcohol occasionally usually in social settings. But i guess it depends on your personality....?|`|AA11993638	There is no direct answer for this as the addiction level is different for each individual. There are those who can be addicted to alcohol the first time they have it, never, or somewhere in between, just like for smoking.|`|bT4JqAwYaa	i feel addicted to alcohol but i am an alcoholic so... An i have smoked before an not got hooked. But drank once an didn't stop since.|`|g2tGislaaa	yes|`|JQMajdtvaa	it's opposite for me.|`|ZdmkoWelaa	I've been smoking for 3 months and I'm still not addicted yet, it all depends on the person|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Yes, Alcohol is not even close to being as addictive as smoking. Ciggarettes contain nicotine which has been said to be almost as addictive as heroin.     Alcohol is only addictive if you use it so much that your body starts to rely on it to be normal.|`|fOL0JNU2aa	Maddie addiction is a train of mind. People continue to do these things cause they want to, or thats the only way they know to deal with their problems. For many reasons people claim they are addicted but if they really wanted to stop they could drop it in a day.|`|xZMoaqRSaa	no i tried smoking more than once, but i sure not addictive to it i havent even smoked in over a yr it was a few time thing just to try it. But i still drink i think alcohol is more addicting. bc it starts out as i just drink on the weekends. then one party during the week. then a glass or 2 of wine with dinner. See how alcohol can be addicting???|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Boy... that's a tough one.  I'm addicted to both (and so far with the help from others) have quit both.  I'm trying to think if one downfall has more or less effect on me than the other.  Honestly they both seem to pull at me the same way.      How about:  When I smoke there's less chance of being pulled over and given a "D.W.I."|`|cOxTFIZ8aa	Seems that way.|`|MPPiex89aa	No, you need at least a pack or two of cigarettes to be addicted, usually. Sometime it depends on the person, though. But usually you never get hooked right away.|`|yOKycrPYaa	Depends on the persons will power I think. If something you consume has an addictive ingredient then your brain will tell you that it wants more and give you a craving for it, addictions start off small and can become worse if you keep feeding it. It all comes down to will power.|`|VrjF986Aaa	well I have smoked cigarettes on and off throughout my life, but I was never actually addicted to them and I can quit really easily, and have been quit since before the holidays and have no problem staying stopped. I also drink every 2 - 3 days but usually only 1 -3 drinks and have never been hooked to alcohol. I think every person is different. Something to think about too is that it is easy to function in life being addicted to tobacco, but if you are addicted to alcohol it is much harder to hold down a job and take care of basic responsibilities. It is also more socially acceptable to be addicted to cigarettes than to be addicted to alcohol.
6PQOjBrYaa	yeah ,work as post man.
gSo4dR7oaa	You should be fine.  More than 98% of people who have HIV would test positive within 3 months after getting infected.  In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months from the time of infection for someone to test positive.    Regarding the answer above mine:  Most people who have HIV have NO symptoms for SEVERAL years.  That is why the ONLY way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested.  HIV can not be diagnosed based on symptoms, and lack of symptoms can not be taken as proof that someone is not infected.  Once someone is infected, they can transmit the virus to others within 24 hours of the time they got infected themselves, long before showing symptoms, and even before testing positive.|`|s6stLtvLaa	9 months is more than enough time for testing for HIV.  Usually you test at 3 months and 6 months and most people test positive if they have the virus at 3 months.  You are fine.|`|SFmLdU7Eaa	heh, dumb much?|`|mYGbxuCAaa	If you really are concerned i would go to a doctors office to find out, safe sex dont share needle the usual drill. And i dont thik you are, if you had HIV you would be sick and weak by now with no treatment, 9 months you would notice, but go to make sure, or get some info in like panphlets or seomthing, also find out if the man had HIV, or something.|`|2NUp7ZZJaa	Well maybe you should have been taking care of yourself!  Then you wouldn't have to worry about it.    That's how you sound answering my question.   INSENSITIVE!!    You have NOOOOOO room to talk hun.    I personally don't even have sex like that to have to take care of myself. You obviously dont use condoms. And even if I were on birth control it wouldn't have worked cuz I was celebate for a year and it just happened. So it would take 72 hours to take affect. So practice what you preach.    Just making a point.
al0cCPb6aa	I don't think fasts are bad...anyone who is religious would agree as well as some health nuts. Alot of people go on fasts to cleanse there body, so I say good for you!      Now when you break it...don't go on an eating spree. I say only eat around 300-500 calories a day...eat just breakfast and lunch...for dinner eat sugar free jello with fat free whip or sugar free pudding.      Don't eat any red meats at first...just eat all white meat and fish. I also eat veggie burgers, they give you protien without all the extra fat and calories.    Watch your carb intake I'd say 1 serving of carbs a day. Work out...and for the 1st month do this. 2nd month you can eat 600-700 calories a day...and continue like that. Monitor your weight at all times. Keep working out...afterthis, you'll be so used to eating healthy, that's all you'll want to eat.
3IphNklBaa	well considering for every inch you grow past 5 feet you are supposed to gain 5 pounds. so that means you should weigh about 130-135 give or take 5% of your body fat. I would say you are in perfect shape, but if you feel like you could be thinner, you could always work out a Little, but eat the same so you could be more toned, but still be healthy.|`|6rrP6p8vaa	no that doesn't sound fat at all, but I think it would be ok to lose 5 pounds if you want to. but you don't really need to. Good Luck!
7pkxOc6Raa	Working out that muscle group is bad, yes. You can still work out something else.    And if your biceps are sore next time you lift for them, you are doing them way too often. They heal in 3-4 days, you should not be sore that long, and should only train them twice a week at the very most. Anything else is pointless.|`|BopBYwSdaa	if it's doesn't hurt, it doesn' work  but overdo it... sore hurt or cramp muscle possible (normal too)    hurt and sore should last a few days then you can work out again and your muscle should be more tolerance|`|2nWtytwQaa	yes, you need to let your muscles heal before you work out again or you can cause damage
un0C52G8aa	This is one of the reasons I haven't gotten this procedure. I would only be trading one problem for another. I've had people try to talk me into considering it, telling me that I would only need to wear glasses for reading or close up work. I don't like reading glasses. They don't actually improve your vision but only magnify what you're doing. I can see a lot better without them. I would hate to have to rely on them. I would prefer continuing to wear glasses or contacts than have to frequently fumble in my purse for a pair of crappy drug store reading glasses just so I can read a newspaper or a magazine. Older people do use them a lot. In fact, they use them more frequently than many younger people realize.    I know something like this is a matter of personal preference but for me, the trade-off isn't worth it.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	For those who were mildly nearsighted, they can read by taking their glasses off. But with the surgery, you are no longer nearsighted, so help is needed for close up vision when presbyopia starts, around early to mid 40's...    Those who were severely myopic ( nearsighted ) usually couldn't read when they took their glasses off anyway without holding the book 2 inches away from their nose.    I am much happier just needing a reading glass for close work than to have to wear glasses all day to see distance,,,that's for sure !    I have never needed distance glasses, so it was normal that I started needing readers , although I made it to 47 before really having to start.    It really depends on how myopic the person was before surgery as to whether they would have needed reading glasses eventually anyway.
0v7c0mY4aa	your very lucky, some people are just annoying that way lmao    probs fast metabolism :)|`|Uotb9Ygsaa	cough cough , your not normal, your skinny =D    fast metabolism, probably because you stopped exercising XD your body isn't craving food and more energy so you just sh*t it all out (:     lucky cow lol x|`|gH9nKiTYaa	your a skinny beaych. = )
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|4htyTXJSaa	quick tip  stay away from fried foods and red meat and junk food,practice of eating small meals - one approximately every three waking hours  is by far the most effective way to speed up your metabolism.  swimming is the best exercise also running is good  also play sports and keep your body active, dont sit on your butt all day|`|nh9NAzMTaa	just eat fruits veggies, lean meet no processed foods, or junk food, do not eat white flour or sugar and you will loose tons of weight
Bo6s8j5Gaa	You could just be stressing them a lot,    Ask the coaches or go to the doctor.    I was also a gymnast for 5 years.|`|kyxu7mlNaa	hey i would check with a Doctor, or it could be that your growing make sure you take calcium ( 2 glasses of milk is good or calcium vitamins)
3dPwxPSGaa	If its excruciating pain then you might have pulled a muscle, or worked too hard, if it a little less then it might just be fatigue or lactic acid build up.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|QMMmUWwhaa	Yes you can.  Look up circuit training and find a regiment that will work for you.  I did it in iraq and lost nothing but fat and gained muscle the entire time.  I was also eating 180g protein a day and taking supplements though.

They do help alot.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	get hot watter bottle  2 tynenol  juice  bath  and chocolate :)|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Hot water bottles are great. Take a couple of painkillers as soon as you feel a cramp coming on - don't leave it until its really painful.
5fdgfNCRaa	Try to watch what you eat. Cut out things like soda or fast food or limit them. You're only 12 so in the long run I'm willing to bet your body will even itself out. In the mean time, start watching what you eat.

And if you can get to the gym 3 times a week that will help alot too.  Hope this helps.|`|DNLJwLZqaa	1. Stop drinking soda and replace it with water.  2. eat lots of fruits and veggies versus unhealthy foods  3. eat a salad before meals, it fills you up.  4. wait 20 minutes after eating and then decided if you're still hungry.  5. always think about WHY you're eating what you are, because you're hungry or bored?  6.Do exercises like squats, sit ups, push ups, etc.|`|SkLeo8C3aa	Well you should already know that all that stuff you are eating is not healthy, but I understand not having anything else to eat. Drink water with everything you eat, don't eat large quantities eat small amounts. Walk around the block every day. Its honestly not that difficult if you just put in the effort. I believe in you.|`|7VMjT6JQaa	First of all, talk to your mom, dad, adult, doctor, whoever - because they will probably have really good advice as well.    Stop the soda - that is the worst possible thing for you.  Instead, try flavored carbonated water.    To get motivated to work out, join a school sports team, or just go for a 30 min walk everyday with a friend or just an ipod.  Even 15 min is better than nothing, and you can work up to 30.    You'll find that healthy foods fill you up more than junk food.  Try an apple instead of a bag of chips.  It is okay to have junk food once in a while, but in moderation.    Most importantly, eat when you are hungry.  Don't snack when you are not.  Obviously, don't starve yourself.  Listen to your stomach.  When you hear it growling, eat.  If you aren't hungry, but just have a craving or nothing else to do - don't.  Find something else to do, a hobby.  Take a bath - that works.
AA10426435	Well After His Conussion Earlier.. It seems pretty bad. The Rib Is Not A problem, but the collapsed lung could be.

K7jq0hkSaa	Crutches are a nightmare. I've only been on them since about 3am Saturday morning. I was at a nightclub and the floor was a wet and i slipped, fell over VERY awkwardly on my ankle and the bottom of my fibula is broken :/ So yeah crutches have been my best friend and worst enemy for nearly a week now. They're annoying but i'd be screwed without them! It's funny that i came across this question, because today it all got to me a bit and i was thinking how nobody i know can really relate to how difficult it is being on crutches with broken bones! What happened to you? if you don't mind me asking?     Olivia :)|`|NEsgGKQ5aa	Well, I'm not on crutches but I have my 7-year-old(8 tomorrow) on. He broke his lower leg bones on December and he's on crutches. He walks pretty good, he has no problems but he had to learn because he had to go to school, my little boy sometimes get tired and his armpits were sore the first days, being on crutches and with a broken leg is not good for anyone, my boy would have to be in his bed the whole time without crutches. He will have a shorter cast on his leg the next week and he's supposed to walk on it, but if he needs he can use his crutches. This is my answer. Good luck.|`|wOGUL6v6aa	My leg was crushed in the crash of a light airplane.  I was in a cast and on crutches for seven months along with two surgeries.  Complications set in and my leg was taken at mid-thigh.  That was two years ago and I use crutches most of the time because I have always been a high heel freak and wear one 4" heel.  Feel free to email me.|`|e49645bfb5de900c2415f519da297d20aa	Stepped off a porch which i thought was 6 inches off the ground, but was really 4 ft. Broke my ankle in three places, dislocated it, and tore a bunch of tendons and ligaments. Spent the first few weeks zonked on pain meds. I Hobbled for 6 months. I couldn't drive. I caught rides from people.|`|ttbho89Vaa	well, like last year i was playing basketball and broke my leg in half and i had to have surgery to get metal rods in my leg and i had a cast for about 5 months and a boot for 7 months. i was in a wheelchair for most of this time. it was not fun:[ haha when i got my boot off a couple months ago i was sooo afraid to walk cuz i didnt want to break my leg again! haha and i have like a permanent metal rod in my leg right now haha it doesnt hurt anymore. only like a sharp pain sometimes :]
C88VCkvnaa	I eat Quaker Caramel Rice Quakes, honey wheat pretzels, air popped popcorn, fruits, vegetables.. for breakfast, Kashi GoLean Crunch! Cereal is awesome. :)  When you're not having a snack or a meal, keep some sugarfree gum on hand. It's awesome when you have a craving for something. Or some sugarfree mints are great too!  For beverages, water is always an awesome option, but there are some diet sodas and low cal options you could have too. Or juice!|`|al0cCPb6aa	first thing I want you to remember that craving is just a feeling. There are so many other emotions and feelings you control and you really have to start thinking of craving the same way.      I want you to think about what you are craving.    Lets say...you want soda really bad. That means you want something sweet to drink.    I would suggest buying v8 fusion it is sweet and you get a serving of fruit and vegetables. They have different flavors like orange mango, strawberry banana, acai berry, Raspberry, and Pomagranete. There's also just fruit V8 juices pina colada is my favorite.      Lets say you want chocolate    buy calcium chewables, they come in different flavors, chocolate, raspberry, carmel, and mint chocolate in some stores. Take them up to 3 times a day...with each meal really helps with choclate cravings.      Lets say you want chips....instead buy some butter free popcorn and salt free pretzles...they are both crunchy and your chip craving will be just a dream.      What about pizza? What's in pizza...cheese, sauces...meat...    Make yourself a sandwhich it has the meat, bread and cheese.      Some snacks to keep in your purse...i say the popcorn and pretzles...get a tiny tupperware and put some in there.     also buy lots of sugar free gum...I love extra gum it helps alot as well.|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	ask a doctor that question.
aaRMPDIDaa	You are supposed to eat a healthy breakfast.  Breakfast should be the biggest meal of the day, despite what people think.  If Breakfast is your biggest meal of the day, then you have ALL day to burn off what you ate, and it will jump start you metabolism.  Breakfast can be eaten anywhere from 5am - 10am.      Lunch should be a smaller meal, and should be eaten anywhere from 2-3 hours after breakfast.  You should eat a small lunch, and then have a snack about an hour later.      It is easier for you body to digest food when you don't cram too much in your stomach.      Dinner should be eaten NO LATER than 8pm.  Many would say don't eat anything after 6pm, but I disagree with that.  I don't even get home from work until about 6:30 sometimes!      If you want to lose fat, you are going to have to jog more than once a week.  I would increase your jog time, and your resistance, and also increase the number of times per week you go.  I would suggest going at the very least, 3x per week.  I try to do some sort of cardio at least 3-4 times per week, and it definitely shows.  When I don't work out, I tend to get bloated easily.      Also, I would try to cut out as much salt as you can.  Also try to cut out things like fast food, fried foods, soda, etc, and try to eat more fruits and vegetables.      Try to find some good and nutritious foods that you can eat to stop cravings, like Yoplait 100 calorie yogurts, Nature Valley Oats and Honey Granola bars, Any fruits and Vegetables.    I hope that helps.  Good Luck!
5LJUiqOUaa	in the u.s., the dentist checks your teeth and sees if you really do need braces . but if your regular dentist sends you to an ortho., then you probably need them . but idk what they do in the uk .|`|HoZYr3bXaa	The dentist decides whether you need them or not, and sometimes its up to you [thats my situation]. If you are to have them, you have to have somethingin your mouth to make a mould of your teeth, to shape the brace, and it decides whether you need a retainer or not.  A retainer can be a funny shaped piece of metal, which one of my friends has, and she has it for 6 months. She's actually recently got train tracks.  My other friend has a retainer which is clear plastic, it comes after train tracks, and you need that one for a year.
mJFgCvYlaa	Instead of thinking like its a diet, you need to be thinking more of a lifestyle adjustment. First you have to accept that you are making some major changes in your life, instead of thinking going on a diet then going back to what you were doing before.    That said, start with small things one at a time. First thing to do is get rid of sodas if you drink them regularly. We are all conditioned since young to think its okay to drink sodas on a regular basis, it saddens me some people who can't drink just plain water to quench thirst. The second easiest thing to do is eat a good breakfast everyday. By eating breakfast it keeps your metabolism up and keeps you fuller during the day. I'll start with these two tips plus recommended snacks, I hope you have the rest of the plan worked out...    10 healthy foods to keep you full:    - Oatmeal or any whole grains. Eat whole wheat bread, pasta, etc whenever you have an option from white flour. Also, try to sneak them in your cooking whenever possible.     - Dry roasted almonds for snacking. Almonds curb hunger and provide a very good all day snack. Avoid the honey glazed type though.    - Celery is a good filler. Even if you don't like celery try to sneak them in your cooking when possible.. Throw some in your stew, salads, etc so its not overwhelming like a whole celery stick.    - Brown rice to replace white rice, or mix them both when cooking rice.    - If you don't eat fruit regularly, pick just one, and enjoy it as much as you can.     - Drink plenty of water. It helps you keep you full. Sometimes you're actually not hungry, but thirsty.    - Soups for dinner is an excellent idea, or lunch is good too.    - Pick healthy, whole grain cereals for breakfast. If you find it tasteless you can add stuff like raisins or cranberry raisins. you can eat cereal as snacks as well.    - Just salted popcorn instead of chips for snacks. Look for ones without trans fat or the cheese powder kind.    - If you have a Starbucks habit, switch over to just plain coffee, or tea. My favorite is black coffee, with quarter cup added water so its not so strong. If you can't take black just as little sugar/milk as you can, and avoid the fancy choco-vanilla-caramel-cream stuff.|`|2fxziuIyaa	best way to stop falling off your diet is not to completely deprive yourself of having them. if you want choc then have a snack size bar or something you can break down easy such as diary milk.    they do say an apple and water fills you up when hungry.    porridge is a good slow burner.    beans on toast.
UOZP4Ma5aa	ITs to fill the hole with a material that is the same color as your tooth so it does not show up
GRzGP7ruaa	I've been in your position and it was no fun.  I tried lots of things and nothing helped me.  It felt like my body was immune to everything and I was never going to find an answer.  Then, I did kind of what you're doing and granted my research to the internet.  I found a lot of weird answers there!  Some of them were even pretty humorous.  But, of course reading funny diet plans, was not going to help me.    While researching I learned all sorts of bad and good things about different diets.  One I learned about was tea and the effects on the body.  Specifically Teavalize.  It's basically tea, with a few extra incentives.  You can drink it hot or cold, even better there are different flavors.  It contains anti-oxidants that help promote weight loss and your health.    Still remaining within the ingredients is a little bit of caffeine, also helping with weight loss and giving you energy.  I found the best deal at diettrials.info, two week trial for less than five dollars.  Plus you could if one doesn't work this site allows you to try several different products.  Enabling you to find something that works for your body without breaking the bank.

lYx5qn6uaa	When I was in high school, I was heavily into drugs. It took my boyfriend at the time almost dieing of an overdose in front of me to Finlay wake me up. I disowned all my friends that I would use with. It is absolutely toxic to be around it because you will always have the urge to try it "just one last time". Surround yourself with people who don't present a temptation. Occupy your time. Anything that keeps you busy, and your mind off drugs. It is doable. I always thought I was the  weakest person when it came to temptation, but I did it. Five years later, I'm a happy wife and mother and soon to be personal trainer and life coach. Good luck, you can do it!|`|ijpU8jSCaa	remember , theres someone out there just like youu , add me , email me , i'll replyy .|`|AA11893137	You are very brave to want to give up all you are use to and it takes lots of courage, but stick to it and do different things go swimming its good fun once you take that first step to going. Put on an radio and go jogging or walking take a dog for a walk the year will soon pass if you keep busy and out of the way of others that bring you down.Join a library read lots of books about what you want to do in the future. I wish you all the very best for the future, and enjoy your life there is so much for young people to do now days its up to you to grab everything and go for it. All the best.|`|rUN9Dca2aa	Wow, you are dealing with a lot of stuff.  But, if it makes it any easier, you might want to consider the notion that maybe your life has been difficult to test you - to see if you have what it takes to rise above it all?  I had some stuff that I had to deal with when I was younger, and got into some bad stuff too.  One thing that has helped me a lot is reading books on self-help or spirituality.  I would strongly suggest The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  The best thing you can do is to break away from your old patterns, including toxic people, even so-called "friends" like you described above.  Also, if you are dealing with substance abuse in your family, you might want to reach out to a group like Al-Anon.  They are dedicated to helping people who are affected by other people's addictions (like your dad's alcoholism).  Their website is: http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/.  Also, you say that you don't have any friends, but perhaps there is somebody at your school, such as a counselor, who can at least point you in the right direction.  Good luck kid!  Don't give up - you have taken the first step toward a happier life - getting sober and wanting  to improve your life.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	i can tell you this, each day you stay sober you will feel stronger, brighter, and more able to deal with the other problems in your life.    you will probably have to let your old friends go anyway, because they will tempt you back into that life.     get your education and get away from your Dad and make your own life.    good luck my friend.

If you look more fit, then that's probably what is happening.|`|qdFPXVabaa	If you are doing what you're saying and you weigh more than what you started off with it could mean:  1. That you are losing fat and gaining muscle (muscle weighs more than fat).  or  2. You need to get your thyroid checked!!! Very important!    Great job on cutting down the fatty foods and inputting fruits and veggies and incorporating excerise. Never give up on that! Make sure you don't over do it though.|`|hjwyB0Cnaa	Were you completely sedentary before? As a man you have a great capacity to gain muscle mass, which would be a direct result of all that gym time. That's not such a bad thing if your clothes fit better and you feel great!|`|AA10065264	Like others have all ready stated, the likely reason for your weight gain is increase in muscle mass (which is nothing to worry about). The best way to be sure would be to have your body fat percentage tested. A fit female usually has between 21-24 % body fat but up to 31% is acceptable.  For males it's 14-17% for fitness and up to 25% can be considered acceptable. Anything over 31% for females and 25% for males is considered borderline unhealthy.

Only have sex with someone you trust - someone who makes you relax and is willing to take the time with you, and make sure you have plenty of foreplay to relax you.    I have also used the technique of masturbating to orgasm before my partner enters because this relaxes my vagina and make it more pleasurable - however, i know not everyone is comfortable doing that.

2uDN1SJeaa	I suffered with this problem for YEARS.  I tried all kinds of lubes but I couldn't find ANYTHING that felt natural and wasn't time consuming or getting in the way of the process.  After looking online for different things to try, I found a site that said both Acidophlus and vitamin E are good for lubrication.  Unfortunately, I am unable to find that site at this time, but I do have a couple of links below for you to do your own inquiry.  I have been taking acidophilus daily for a couple of years and I can tell a major MAJOR difference.    I have found that Origin brand found at Tar.get works best for me.

Cool the water temp. down a little bit. When you get up to your room, try blowing a fan on you for a few minutes to cool yourself down. Also, there should be medicated over the count deoderants that you can buy at a WalMart. If anything, you could call your Doctor's Office, talk to a nurse or doctor, and just simply ask if there's anything you can do. You can choose to stay anonymous that way, and don't have to go in.|`|W0jhffBfaa	ugh! i have the same problem!!

PZ5nTQ5jaa	I wouldn't do what you're doing.  There have actually been studies done showing that when you starve yourself you body goes into survival mode and stores more fat, as it is the most energy packed substance in the body.  So, my suggestion would be to eat healthier and exercise.  Also, try not to shoot for a goal "weight" because a healthy, ideal weight is different for each person.  So, I would exercise and eat healthily until you feel you have reached a healthy weight where you feel comfortable with your body.|`|y39iNwFjaa	a safe weight loss is between 1 and 2lbs a week. If you eat nothing, you'll develop an eating disorder and your weight will drop so low that you'll be unattractive. Aim to eat low fat balanced meals with plenty of fruit and veg so that you become slim and attractive.|`|AA11029380	You need to eat a well balanced diet.  If you don't eat enough your body will go into starvation mode and you will lose less weight than if you ate better.  It's best to not lose more than a pound or two a week. Get lots of exercise!|`|ecNeN0staa	So starve!

Just remember your body goes into starvation mode and you will gain it all back when you start eating regularly again. The best thing to do is eat small portions throughout the day and excercise.|`|8GShXVxqaa	If you are having trouble with your appetite find a local chapter of over eaters anonymous, that is what worked for a family member of mine who had been large most of her life. they will give you the support you need sometimes that's all it takes is having someone to talk to and share secrets of success.give them a try.
acVPPTD2aa	More protein should do the trick.  Brushing teeth also helps.|`|6KpEFMV5aa	i am dieting when i am hungry i eat apples it works amazingly  also if you are hungry try brushing your teeth ano it sounds strange but it works no for example for a meal just to put off snacking till dinner for example :)|`|bRoFUcIgaa	You're hungry because you aren't eating enough food- or the food you are eating isn't sticking with you long enough. Go for food choices that are high in fiber as fiber will keep you full for a longer period of time, and can be healthy in moderation.  If you're hungry just after you've ate, drink water- keep drinking a lot of water throughout the day as water is good for you and will trick your body into thinking that it's getting food.  Sugar free low-cal gum is also another option, when you get a craving to eat, just pop a piece of gum into your mouth and you should be good (: Hope this helps x|`|hJX6Ur3taa	You are hungry because your body is not getting the nutrients it needs.  I don't suggest meal replacement supplements.  An 1800 calorie diet with moderate exercise should be plenty to lose weight in a safe manner.  The foods you are eating sounds very reasonable.  Good Luck.|`|al0cCPb6aa	are you drinking enough water? Sometimes people think that they are hungry, when they are actually thirsty. I drink 8-12 cups of water a day. Also try drinking a high caffinated tea I drink 3 cups of wuyi tea a day and it really helps my hunger till it's night time...but I'm going to bed by then.|`|EertNe9Taa	Honestly I have the same problem I have lost 50lbs I feel great I still have a lot of weight to lose, but now with all the working out I do 1-2 hours a day. I want to eat small babies. And I feel that screws me over in the long run. All I can do is keep going try and watch what I eat and time will tell.    But trust me those 14lbs will not come off as easily as the weight you dropped your first couple of weeks look to 1-2 lbs a week stay motivated and you will reach your goal!|`|SjZI6qm4aa	if your hungry than you should eat, but snack healthy.|`|E0b6f7Mkaa	when i get really hungry i force myself to drink like 2 full glasses of water (chug them) and i hotsauce has little to 0 calories to put that on everything you eat because hot sauce decreses an appetite! its a fact!|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Healthy is one thing.    But a diet that leaves you constantly unsatisfied is not bound to be a very successful diet.  Or the fact that you are always hungry may lead you to rethink those 14 extra pounds.    There's nothing implicitly wrong with hunger--it's the body's way of making sure we're getting our food.  But hunger is counter-productive in an environment where food is available cheaply and all the time.  You need to find a way of eating that doesn't leave you hungry.  And maybe reevaluate your weight loss goals in accordance with what your body actually does.|`|Xpu76Wx6aa	If other effect are having  to go the bathroom all the time and thirsty all the time I'm sorry for the bad news, but you may have to go to the doctor and check if you have asama. ):|`|nh9NAzMTaa	just eat fruits veggies, lean meet no processed foods, or junk food, do not eat white flour or sugar and you will loose tons of weight|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Are you eating any carbohydrates? You should be eating 100% Whole Grains, like oatmeal and bread. These will keep you fuller longer. They are not bad for you as long as you don't consume too much. They are a complex carbohydrate, as opposed to a simple carbohydrate (like refined sugar). You can google complex vs simple carbs and see the benefits. As I said, you would probably stay fuller.   Also, are you taking in enough calories in general? Sometimes if we don't eat enough calories, our bodies go into "starvation mode" and signal the body to slow down and stop losing weight so quickly. Depending on your age and height, you should be eating somewhere between 1400 and 1800 calories per day. This is something else you can google, or sign up with a site like sparkpeople.com (a website i often use to lose weight and track my progress) that will calculate how many calories you should be eating per day based on your stats and fitness level. Good luck!
da7acbf57beceea0010f81ab835fb6ecaa	I like the tips here:  http://www.criticalbench.com/bench-press...    Another one they didn't mention is to try to pull the bar apart before you lift off (it won't really break so go crazy). It gets your stabilizer muscles more involved.     Lift with good form. Cheating a little here and there will get you some gains, but once that runs its course you will have cheated the biggest muscles out of their full workouts and you won't get maximum results. Once you get good form you can build quickly by varying your reps and weights and work on building your triceps and delts to keep your max climbing. Exercises like weighted dips and shoulder press really help boost your numbers.     It shouldn't be too hard to reach your goal, just concentrate on getting a few more reps each week and moving up slowly. Good luck!
fZnuyKSZaa	Dont worry.  The BMI is highly controversial for active people. Most sportlers are well beyond 30 ....if you are fit..and I dont mean toned but fit like being able to walk 10000 fairly fast steps per day without getting too much into a huff..then dont worry at all..|`|ToztjpAsaa	Could be a lot of muscle.

KOIK0Q5Qaa	I recommend eating what you normally eat up till midnight so as not to skew the results. If you have high LDL then you want to know about it so it can be addressed by your doctor.    Bottom line is your cholesterol levels are accumulative over weeks and months unlike your glucose levels that are affected immediately.    If you have high cholesterol and do not want to take meds with side effects try Cholestsure. I have been taking it for 10 months and my total cholesterol is 199, used to be over 250.    Contact me if you need more help.|`|q2p1gZdJaa	You can eat anything until midnight. The dr. needs to know lipid levels without food so don't cheat. Hope your labs are good :)|`|3YfYWpAsaa	normally, eating would break a fast, yes.|`|hJuPsaSDaa	It is feasible to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and comprehend that if you lose weight quickly then you will probably put it all back on again just as quickly. The sole thing which clearly worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away twenty five pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|oi7C4LKHaa	yes! trust me. do not do it or you will not get a true read. It may be higher and you may be put on medicine you may not need. Do not anything for 12 hours before you do. And if you can help it. eat no meat cheese or butter a day before. try cereal with skim milk or fruit and a salad. Screwing up your test will only harm you. If you get a high reading from eating meat.....unnecessary meds will damage your liver.       DONT DO IT!|`|wuXzDUGQaa	Don't eat anything 12 hours before your cholesterol test. And please, no alcohol the night before the test-that'll increase your triglyceride levels!!
ztnP1mgfaa	Your weight itself doesn't really mean anything. You would need to have said how tall you are to figure out if you are overweight. If you are active, eat right, and can do all the things you want to do without being limited by being tired or out of breath, then you don't need to lose weight.|`|dd6rgtL7aa	So get off your fat butt and lose some weight.

It has a bunch of numbers which takes into account ur height and weight and if ur BMI (body mass index) is between a certain range ur good...only thing is it doesn't take into account muscle mass.

You should be eating at least 1200 calories a day, or your metabolism will slow down and this diet will make you more likely to gain weight later on in life. Your weight is right at the bottom of the healthy range so you are much better off eating healthy than screwing with your metabolism. Also, 1200 is a bare minimum- less than that is considered starving so you could probably maintain your current weight eating waay more than that, especially if you exercise.|`|AA11481224	not nearly enough    your starving yourself your weight is healthy    your body needs 2000to 2500 calories a day to be healthy     your eating at mt a 1000 calories    your growth will be stunted  please talk to your parents and see a doctor

I did my research and here is what i found.     Acne is often caused by a hormone unbalance. Acne becomes present with the release of testosterone. Now as a woman or a man your body produces both estrogen and testosterone. In the body of a woman very little testosterone should be released into the body, such as in a man very little estrogen should be released into the body.     it's very common in women to have a little too much testosterone leaking out, so if you correct this problem the acne will go away. Talk to your dermatologist about going on the birth Control pill called "Yazmine" along with the pill "Aldacdone". It doesn't dry out your skin in the least. It's probably the best acne solution for women, and you don't have to be on it for a super long time. maybe a year at the most.     I had super bad bacne, this cleared it up like none other. i wont recomend anything other then these two pills. I recomend trying it before you it's too the point where you have scars like me.
ZtY9xWzyaa	There's a product that will actually conceal and treat your dark circles at the same time. It's called Eye Spy by Dermadoctor and it has natural ingredients that will help give your eyes a fuller, healthier look.

gaA5rX24aa	any contact with the penis and the vagina, you loose your virginity in my opinion|`|XCag7QRTaa	r u stupid?|`|JTNGGu97aa	I do not want to judge or anything like that. I'm merely trying to give my opinion. Sometimes people think too much about the scientific meaning of virginity, in which case she is still a virgin as her hymen's existence indicates. I kind of believe in more of a "spiritual" or philosophical sense of the term virgin. I mean if a penis has been in a vagina then you have had sex reguardless of whether or not the hymen broke. That's just my view. Scientifically, virgin, in my thought process or the way i would judge people, not a virgin|`|woOeYFrEaa	Ummm, apparently you're confused about the location of the hymen.  Its directly at the entrance of the vagina.  Go look it up in anatomy textbook--it on the outside of your body.  So even if the guy is in a half inch, he's already passed through the hymen.  Its very possible for remnants of the hymen to hang around until after a woman has had her first child.  Some small children break theirs in falls.  So are they not virgins?    That's the problem with assigning virginity to a physical membrane that can be damaged by ways other than sex and could technically remain intact after sex.    If a penis has entered the vagina, your virginity is gone.  Sorry.  You might think its just "teasing and foreplay" but I think you'll find any medical doctor or anyone else would agree that any kind of penetration counts as sex and you're not a virgin.
