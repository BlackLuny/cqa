4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It looks like it might happen as the WWE storyliners are looking at it as Austin's farewell match and also as part of the angle involving Jericho's ongoing feud with the Hall of Famers.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	maybe|`|3k4tPNTGaa	It can happen as austin said in a interview that he wud love to fight jericho as he is the one of the few wrestler whom he can trust( because stone cold has a severe neck injury and a minor injury on neck again can cause him to be paralized forever.) So this can happen otherwise wwe cud use John Cena vs Austin match and that match wud have creat more hype dn jericho / austin match. But may be austin dsnt have nuch faith in John Cena's wrestling ability.

I agree Price Could be the one, but is far from it right now. Bottom line you guys have 2 goalies with GREAT potential, but no track record.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	Neither one outshadows the other, so for now, they may as well continue to share Goaltending. Halak is improving though...<br>  <br>  Its working for Boston with Tim Thomas and Manny Fernandez...|`|bxibWXnsaa	I would go with the hot goalie, so Halak...I think Price is a decent goalie but Montreal hyped him up way too much calling him the next coming of Roy. There are really only 3 goalies that first came into the league and took the world by storm and remained all-starts their whole careers: Roy, Brodeur, and Lundqvist (won gold with sweden as a rookie and since as been putting up "sick" numbers for the rangers. Not to mention the Ranger +/- as a team is -130, so they wouldnt even be the 7th seed in the east if it wasnt for Lundqvist)|`|axxQzOCHaa	Halak has been doing great lately, but Price habs-olutely (pun intended !!) needs to get some games in and regain his confidence.

lYnkvRASaa	It just shows they are prudent businesspeople.  They know the team is in rebuild mode and making the playoffs are unlikely so the will budget accordingly on the revenue side.<br>  <br>  Leafs are certainly not cheap,in the precap days they were one of the highest spenders and will be again in the future.  They want to win and in order to do so they have to rebuild.  Kinda simple, look at what Flyers and pens did,<br>  <br>  So guess what I did not reply to your initial question but guess what my opinion has not changed slappy.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	First off, what does Cherry have to do with the Leafs? Do you think he manages them? Controls them? What does he have to do with their finances?<br>   Secondly, yeah, an article today about their realization they won't be in the play-offs, tell us something we don't know.<br>  <br>   It's obvious that you don't understand the day to day operations/economics and whatnot of an NHL franchise.<br>  <br>   The players should take a cut? I don't even know where to start.<br>  <br>   First you say they are cheap......now you say they aren't cheap but just overpay. OK. And? Again, the point you were originally trying to make was that Don Cherry knows nothing and you know what you are talking about.....to that end you are failing miserably.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	They are in a rebuild mode.<br>  <br>  Burke has maintained they're holding on to their cap space and not to repeat the mistakes of the past (Blake, Kubina, Toskala- all JFJ deals).<br>  This has been covered to death.  <br>  <br>  In today's NHL, cap space is a valued commodity, and they have a ton of it.<br>  <br>  Look- clearly you hate the Leafs.  Fine.  Line forms to the left.<br>  <br>  What, prey tell, is your point?  You sound like some pissed-off fan who hates the fact that when the Leafs come to town there's 1/3 of the building in blue and white, despite the fact that they're not going anywhere this year and have had no recent success to speak of.<br>  <br>  Good luck with those "pay cuts"...clearly you have no understanding of NHL contracts, or the NHL CBA agreement.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	1. "the leafs are a cheap organization "<br>  <br>  -The Leafs are the richest team in the NHL.<br>  <br>  2. "dont want to win"<br>  <br>  -Everyone wants to win.<br>  <br>  3. "especially that they didnt budget for the playoffs which is why they dont want the Leafs to win. "<br>  <br>  -No, they're realistic. Leaf fans have been screaming for rebuilding for 10 years and the old organization didn't do it. They're now doing it all at once, and anyone with a brain recognized that with the roster they had going in, they were going nowhere.<br>  <br>  -I appreciate your opinion, but don't assume you know everything.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	This is a moot point. Leafs not budgeting for a playoff series is akin to Florida Panthers not raising parking rates. Both have the same overall effect on Hockey Operation. The budgeting for playoff games is an old Leaf habit whereby the shareholders are given an expected return on investment. A playoff run for the Leafs generates about 2-2.5 Million dollars profit per game. Before the salary cap the budget would identify how much money they would spend on salaries. With the cap this is fixed. NHL hockey in Toronto is a licence to print money. Playoff games are gravy. The shareholders are missing the cream off their deserts. They fired three GM's and two coaches because they haven't made the playoffs in four years. If that doesn't sound like they want to win I don't know what does.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	That's from Sept. for crying out loud! Until they had their GM in place...what did you expect? Burke is now in place and will manage the cap as he see's fit for a team that is in re-build mode. How can a GM build if he has no monies available when he steps in??<br>    Spending cash just because you have it doesn't buy you the Stanley Cup.|`|795nSfFiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Half the Organization said making the playoffs was not a realistic goal for the year. It is called rebuilding for the future. In many people's opinion the team still over achieved. <br>  <br>  Thank You

FFE9Qztzaa	Cant really make the comparison. But most people here will say Welbeck, simply because he has gotten MORE playing time and has a couple goals under his belt as well. 1 League goal and  2 in the F.A Cup..<br>  <br>  I'm going with Welbeck . But who knows in the forthcoming seasons. I might even change my choice.|`|HxET88bDaa	Welbeck without a doubt, he is already looking like a good player, still a lot of work to do but you can see the talent. Ngog has played quite a few times and even though he has got a few goals he doesn't impress me to be honest, that's not because i support Utd, it's just my opinion.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Lets see where they are this time next year before making a comparison. Ngog has played what one full game in the Premiership...?|`|duJgBxUoaa	Ngoooog :)<br>  What legend :D|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Welbeck, I think, under Fergie, is gonna have more of an impact that Ngog. At least he's started more games than Ngog and has the ability to be the next best English player if molded well by Sir Alex|`|IWM1khX7aa	Both of them will be great players.  David N'gog has more growing room at Liverpool, but it won't matter since Danny Welbeck is way better.|`|Y8n3hbN4aa	Welbeck, N'Gog isn't even remotely as good. Carlos Vela is better than both.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Welbeck|`|THaKSvKwaa	i know im a liverpool fan but i have no faith in Ngog<br>  gotta be Welbeck!|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	Danny Welbeck by a country mile|`|632BbbUtaa	welbeck|`|Hiasgb75aa	Welbeck by a mile|`|FPxXiabNaa	Too early to tell yet.

I have to go with Welbeck.
HxET88bDaa	I think you spelled his name wrong.<br>  <br>  Yes, he looks really good, more skilful than Tosic. It was said we kind of bought Tosic so Ljaji? would come to us too. I just hope we definitely get him...<br>  <br>  Not bothered about his looks, i hate football turning into a blooming fashion parade..p1sses me off...|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	he is like Kaka in terms of speed and dribbling, he's 17 so i wouldn't put pressure on him and allow him time to grow|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	There is no doubt that he will be better than Nani and Anderson, that's not really hard but please don't do that, he didn't play ONE single game for Man U and he is next C.Ronaldo.... don't embarrass yourself!!!!
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I'll take Recchi over Guerin any day!  Guerin's best season was 85 points (and he played 85 games that year).  He has never averaged more than a point a game in an NHL season.  Only once (and he's 3 years younger) has he ever outscored Recchi in a season (and again, this year, Recchi has outscored Guerin despite playing fewer minutes (not just seconds) a game).  Bill Guerin last made it to the 3rd round of the playoffs while Gretzky was still playing.  Recchi may be old, but he's still a very productive player and brings a lot to the team.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think the Bruins made a couple of great deals today with the additions of both Montador and Recchi.   Two players who have played in the Stanley Cup final recently and bring a great deal of experience.<br>  <br>  Recchi isn't going to be looked upon as an on-ice leader with this team, but he will be expected to lead in the dressing room.  The only team I can recall where he was considered detrimental in the dressuing room was his second tenure with the Flyers (a bit close to home for you maybe).  <br>  <br>  Again, Recchi is a far better choice than Guerin.<br>  <br>  Both Guerin and Recchi have been put into great situations and time will tell which one was the best.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Interesting, it is not the player for picks deal I expected. Looks like the pick Boston gets will be an early second rounder unless Tampa has a great year next year.  Don't know much about Karsums (2004 pick) its time for him to develop if he is going to.  Lashoff supposed to be a good one.<br>  <br>  Good deal for the Bruins, if I was a Bolts fan I would not like a deal where I lose a pick too.<br>  <br>  Edit: the B's are accumulating old Mtl Right Wingers, Ryder, Rechhi, anyone know if Richer can come out of retirement?  Maybe they can trade for Claude Lemieux in the next hour.|`|2PlJEJzQaa	I like it because Recchi can bring some Bruins chemistry down...Recchi is also losing his touch as a player and should consider retirement (i dont actually know statistically but i havent heard his name since he left the Pens) <br>  <br>  I think Recchi is the wrong player for the Bruins...he may score some goals but he wont be happy on a team of young players like savaard and wheeler...i can see him despising savaard<br>  <br>  Recchi off the ice will do more damge to the Bruins than the good Recchi will do on ice|`|AA11051192	Great move by the B's. They already have a bolstering defense, and picking up Recchi can now add another spark to the front lines, especially seeing how the B's have been struggling a bit lately. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping for one more big move by the end of dayand as long as the Bruins can do that while still keeping their young talent (Krejci, Kessel, Wheeler, Lucic), they should be a force now down the stretch.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I Think Guerin woulda cost the B's a little bit more than they wanted to deal with. I don't think Charelli (sp?) wanted to mess up the chemistry of the team too badly at this point int he season, especially the way it has been.|`|naZQqrNeaa	I hope that Matt Lashoff is good.  We need the D.<br>  <br>  I agree with CDN24....I don't see why we had to give up a 2nd rounder.|`|0qNbEif3aa	Recchi is a good fit for Boston right now. He is definitely still a productive player and a great leader. An obvious rental player, but they can handle that and move on once the time comes. Recchi wants one more shot at the Cup and will do anything it takes to help Boston get there, be it point production to the best of his capabilities and as a leader. <br>  <br>  He wants a Cup and to retire, could be the year this year.|`|AA12089021	I think this move works considering that they also landed Steve Montador.  Granted, he is not a forward but they have definitely added toughness.<br>  <br>  I think given the trade market, they made the best deal they could.  Recchi makes about 25% of what Guerin is worth this season.  He's a rent-a-player who should contribute to a cup run this year.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Will fill in anywhere...well, either wing, should the Bruins run into injury problems. Good leadership..will do what is asked of him and will be good for the young guns on the Bruins going deep into the playoffs.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Decent rental player; good guy...score a few goals.  Not a bad move.

As for Bruce Lee's thoughts on the subject, I could care less.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	there is no right or wrong place to have your weight, it depends on your style, and what you are doing at the time. you should not relay on only one stance but have at least 3. each stance has is own advantages.<br>  <br>  everyone uses different stances in sparing. you can tell a lot about the way a person fights by there stance. a wide stance is good for evasion, narrow is a linear fighter and so forth.|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	weight shifts to one leg for balance and keep a lot on your punching hand behind you for power.|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Unless you have trained in a martial art for many years the most important aspect of a stance is mobility, stand comfortable and loose ready to spring. <br>  some stances and their use<br>  <br>  half-moon. equal balance used in karate as the base stance for learning techniques<br>  <br>  cat stance. 90% weight in the rear 10% weight in the front used for defense. <br>  <br>  horse stance equal weight on both feet used in a number of different throwing techniques.<br>  <br>  although most combat uses even footing their are exceptions<br>  like kendo. kendo tends to keep their weight more to the front.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	The emphasis of this is based upon the philosophy, the strategy of the delivery method, and the model of the stance itself....  <br>  <br>  For example, one method may emphasize stability in stance.  Another may find mobility more desirable.  And depending on the techniques used, the weight distribution will vary.    <br>   <br>  Bruce Lee's Bai-jong stance was intended to create a balance of these elements in the most efficient way Bruce Lee could conceive.  <br>  <br>  However, I think he may say that it would not to be a good idea to fix in you mind an ideal image of a stance.

h1dTg5C1aa	If your boot is broken down it would be dangerous for you to continue to try doubles on them. If your skates are really bad you could injure yourself such as a twisted, or sprained ankle. The blade and boot are equally important. But if you need to pick between the two I say get a new boot. <br>  <br>  Ask your coach if you really need new skates. They will be able to tell you and give you suggestions on what to do.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	blades|`|akA3oJx6aa	Both are important, but the blade wouldn't break down like the boot.<br>  <br>  The boots you tried on aren't as comfortable because you haven't broke them in yet or gotten used to them. I'm working on my doubles and my skates, with separate boots and blades, costed around $300-$400.

0P4rYT8Qaa	There's a lot of good prospects out there, but I don't know if each one will play during '09. Many of them will play in '09 and make an impact though. Here's my list:<br>  <br>  1) (SP) David Price (Rays) - The guy's awesome. He was dominating in the postseason, even though he barely even pitched in the regular season. It reminded me of K-Rod in '02, with the Angels, except he didn't win a title. The Rays rotation is loaded with Kazmir, Shields, Garza, Sonnastine and now Price.<br>  <br>  2) (C) Matt Wieters (Orioles) - People are comparing him to Geovany Soto. He's got a lot of potential. Unfortunately, even if he has a really good year, I don't see the Orioles competing much this season. But you can look for him to be one of the best catcher's in the next decade.<br>  <br>  3) (OF) Jacoby Ellsbury (Red Sox) - With Coco Crisp gone, and Rocco Baldelli unable to play every day, and likely occasionally spot Drew and Bay to keep them fresh, this is Ellsbury's chance to shine.Last year, there were talks about how the Red Sox told the Twins they could have either Lester or Ellsbury for Santana. Santana's still as awesome as people thought, but it was a wise choice for the Red Sox not to do it, because Lester's much more affordable. They regarded Ellsbury with just as much hype, so there's reason to believe he can be great. On the other hand, the Yankees were stupid to not be willing to part with Hughes or Kennedy. As it turns out, they don't even have a spot in the rotation for them. Still though, they signed Sabathia, who's arguably as good as Santana.<br>  <br>  4) (OF) Cameron Maybin (Marlins) - The reason why the Marlins have decent teams every year is because of their youth. Not just to they draft the right players, but they give them the chance to play, largely due to their cheapness to pay them out. Put him at the top of the line-up with Hanley and see his potential and the Marlins may just be able to compete with the Mets and Phillies.<br>  <br>  5) (LF) Daniel Murphy (Mets) - I think he's one of the guy's that's really gone under the radar. He's one of the smartest player's in the game, which is impressive for his age. I'm not sure if there's a stat for hitters who work the count for the most pitches throughout the season, but he'd rank in the top. Recently, Jerry Manuel's said he'll be the starting LF, without a platoon with Tatis. Murphy goes the other way. He doesn't strike out much. He's probably going to be a .300+ hitter for a long time to come. He's the ideal 2 hitter. He'll probably bat 7th for the Mets, because they're counting on a comeback from Castillo, but you can expect good things out of Murphy. He had 131 plate appearances, just one over the total to qualify for the rookie of year, so some people may not consider him a ''prospect'' anymore.<br>  <br>  6) (OF) Andrew McCutchen (Pirates) - He's a good OF who's been in their farm system a few years now. I think they'll be able to play him. Although I wouldn't call him a top prospect anymore, there's a chance Jose Tebata (OF) will a chance too.<br>  <br>  7) (SP) Trevor Cahill (A's) - He's got a 92 MPH sinker with good command. He's arguably the A's best pitching prospect, which they've got plenty of good one's and have a reputation for it. He's been in their system 3 years now. They may want to give him more time.<br>  <br>  8) (OF) Colby Rasmus (Cardinals) - He's got some real potential too. He's been in their system a few years now.<br>  <br>  9) (SP) Kevin Mulvey (Twins) - The Mets thought initially had high expectations with him. They expected him to progress quicker, but some injuries held him back. He had a strong year in AAA last season with the Twins though. I think they'll give him a chance at some point this season.<br>  <br>  10) (SP) Phil Hughes (Yankees) - The question is can he stay healthy? He's got the talent. The Yankees will probably want to move Joba into the set-up role down the stretch, because Brian Bruney won't cut it. Moving Hughes or Kennedy into the 5 spot in the rotation is a possibility.<br>  <br>  11) (SP) Ian Kennedy (Yankees) - Same thing. He's got the talent, but he can't stay healthy.<br>  <br>  12) (SP) - Jon Niese (Mets) - He's the wild card in the competition for the 5 spot in the Mets rotation. In my opinion, they'll give the spot to Tim Redding (due 2.25 million), who's starting to pick up where he should be at, starting out slow because of an injury. I don't see Garcia making it, who's been rocked and FB is only clocked at 83 MPH. Livan's a possibility. But at some point during this season, they'll give Niese a chance. Bobby Parnell throws hard too. I think they're looking to mold him into more of a middle reliever/set-up man, but expect good things out of these two pitchers. Eddie Kunz also throws really hard.<br>  <br>  13 - (SP) J.A. Happ - Like Niese for the Mets, he's a left-hander who's got good stuff. There's a chance he'll win the 5 spot in the rotation, although I'm predicting Kyle Kendrick will win it to start the season. Park's (due 2.5 million) probably going to start the year as the long rel|`|uFIGSbQfaa	Mayberry JR (PHI)<br>  Happ (PHI)<br>  Carrasco (PHI)<br>  Outman (OAK)<br>  Anderson (OAK)<br>  Huffman (SD)<br>  Withrow (LA)|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Sorry, can't go with 10, would have to look it up.<br>  <br>  1.

hQHWVRyTaa	They pick on him because he's at the top of the heap professionally, and others covet that spot. That's why he's almost always in the middle of some feud with someone.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I agree. Some people dislike him because he is married to the bosses daughter and they think that he can get whatever he wants in the WWE. But I can see why others dislike him. He will rarely put other wrestlers over and that can sometimes be a little annoying. I do think he is a great wrestler though and he is one of the best in the business today.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Isn't John Cena an easier target?<br>  <br>  And really, why do you care if people dislike him? Is it an obligation or in the law to like HHH? NO ONE has to like HHH, and a lot of the people that criticize him do it rightfully. You bash TNA constantly, and then complain about how some people don't like HHH. Hypocritical, don't you think?<br>  <br>  "...Also, people who dislike him use it as a way to invalidate his abilities..."<br>  <br>  I don't think HHH is that good of a wrestler, and I've been watching him since the mid-90's, and there are others who don't think so, either.<br>  <br>  **How can you say what I've been saying is irrelevant, and then expect someone to take your thoughts seriously?

TAPBWPJLaa	1. Yes, but only if the Womens Division will be combined together.<br>  2. No. Hardcore wrestling is not that great, especially in WWE, where it's mostly a joke.<br>  3.

No. Half the women in the WWE are horrible wrestlers as is, and there's already too many titles in the WWE.<br>  5. Only if the brand extension ends. That's the only reason for unification of that title, and really the brand extension should end.<br>  <br>  Bonus:<br>  1.

5xIroQjMaa	Those are tough groups to choose. I would have to choose Group A. Lincecum's already got a Cy Young, and Alexei Ramirez and Ryan Braun are both amazing. Soto, Lony and Ellsbury are icing on the cake. Compared to the other groups, Group A just has more proven young stars. Only Group C can compete with Dustin and Hanley, but my preference is for Group A, it's just personal preference there though as both groups are close.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	C.<br>  <br>  You've got many of the infield positions covered.  Jurrjens and Volquez could quite possibly combine for 30 wins if you have the other players.<br>  <br>  McCann, Hanley, and Pedroia are top 5 at their respective positions and Davis is a potential top 10 infielder.  Tremendous potential there.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Group B:<br>  <br>  Youth, youth, and more youth with unlimited potential.|`|AA10495394	No question Group C. Hanley Ramirez and Pedroia on the same time with Volquez. That team will be in the playoffs 4 sure|`|g9P7oWyeaa	The Day you got Braun and Lincecum on your team is the day your team is great. I'd pick Group A, and C coming in second close. Braun is such a great hitter, so will Ramirez be.
AiEGi0Zqaa	I don't know why he would have to be motivated to compete for a bigger contract, seeing as how he's a model of consistence in MLB. The fact is, as long as he hits 35 Hrs, 110 RBI and .300 BA, there'll be a market for him. As such, his fantasy value should stay the same (1st-3rd round), since he'll likely put up the same numbers he's been producing fairly consistently for the past 12 years.|`|AA10654659	I dont like MAnny Ramirez in my fantsy team. He was good last year and he knew he was in the end of his contract year. He only plays when he wants too and next year his numbers will not be as good and at 36 he is not getting better. His ego and injuries tell me to stay away from him but of course if he is avail in the 5th round i will take him. I would not take him in the first 3 rounds and you shouldnt either. Sizemore Braun are young.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Manny's offensive numbers are going to be pretty good I think, but, I don't think he'll have the same numbers he had at the end of last season with LA.  I think he'll go back to his Boston level, which is still pretty good.|`|DTaPkMufaa	I would say he would go mid to late first round. I personally got him before he signed his contract late second round.|`|vXlrA4oMaa	I'd give him the slight edge over a well done pot roast, made with a fine vinegar garnish.

2Xx0Cm2Caa	Because their all front runners that decided to jump on the bandwagon when the Celtics picked up Ray Allen and KG!

The Celtics and Cavs have controlled the east this year and it's unlikely that any team will turn there season around enough to even be considered a contender.  I hope the Pistons keep up their hot streak right now with Hamilton because they are a very good team that does not deserve to have a below .500 record.  I'm from Boston so I'll cheer for the Celtics whoever they're against but I love the Cavs and Magic.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	They are unstoppable and they have Pierce, Garnett, Allen, and James 4 allstars.

There is clearly a wide margin at the top.  The 2 best teams or Lakers and you got the celtics and cavs.  99% of people say those teams are going to be in the finals.  And usually it happens.  At least in the NFL and MLB the underdawgs have a better chance of making it to the championship, but David stern controls his sport more and makes sure he has a good marketable team in the finals by briefing the refs to help out those teams that should be in the finals.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	Detriot doesnt have a chance this year and the reason they choose those two teams because they are #1 and #2 in their conference|`|qusKbEmBaa	The Cleveland Cavs are overrated and aren't as good<br>  as everyone thinks they are.

UhPIYoriaa	Bruce Lee never competed in tournaments.  This is because they were non contact and he thought they were stupid.  However, when he firsted started teaching, he fought another teacher who wanted him to stop.  Bruce lee supposedly won, however this is controversial as only Linda Lee was there besides the two.  Then as callsign said, there was a time when he fought a wrestler and the wrestler pinned him.  When asked what he would do in the situation, he said "bite"|`|g7xaB57Xaa	I could have sworn reading he was defeated at least once in an amature fight before the late 60's.

gBO908P6aa	First of all what is a "master"?  That doesn't necessarily mean some old white haired asian man standing 4 feet tall with magical powers.  People that fight in K-1, Muay Thai, UFC, Pride, etc etc are pretty well disciplined, especially nowadays.  They are professionals who have made a career out of the combat arts, won medals and tournaments and have illustrious resumes.  Granted nobody calls them "master" but they would be as professional as they come.  <br>  Secondly you are asking for matches in stand up striking right?  Throwing hands and feet is considered striking.  Look for any kickboxing venue like K-1 or any of the countless global Muay Thai fights and you will see professionals battling in the ring.  I don't know why that is so hard for you to find.  It's all over Youtube for god's sakes.  Look for guys like Buakaw Por.Pramuk or Jongsanan Fairtex...young "masters" in the stand up striking arts.  Look for Sanda fighters, guys like Cung Le.  It's all there.<br>  Rolling around all "gay" and nuthugging is called GRAPPLING.  Grappling/Groundfighting is also combat and every bit as important as striking.  To the outsider (like yourself) it may look boring and unsophisticated but grappling, like striking, does also require a certain level of technical skill as well.  This is something I don't think you fully understand.  If you think it's nothing, I encourage you to roll around with a good jiujitsu man.  Once you're tied up like a rat in a python's grip, gasping for your last breath of air, you WILL respect the art.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	its called kickboxing and the kickboxers and muay destroy the other martial arts.  why don't we have these...because bjj guys will destroy all the stand up arts, so you have to take the ground out and they do have that its just not real fighting so its not as interesting.|`|hQWucH5uaa	The Rule of Law?<br>  <br>  Another Rome and the Colosseum?<br>  <br>  Why don't they have MMA fighters in the UFC fighting animals?|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	ROFL...<br>  <br>  <br>  Isn't this called Kickboxing?|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Lol, it may look gay, but it's actually a very sophisticated form of fighting. Just because it doesn't look good, doesn't mean it's not effective. <br>  <br>  People are getting worked up because you're saying it's not real fighting. It IS real fighting.  <br>  <br>  If you don't like the ground fighting then watch some form of kikcboxing like muay thai, sanshou, shootboxing, or K1.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm guessing you don't practice martial arts, then.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Define real martial arts masters?

Example being the lack of infighters in MMA due to fear of ground work.|`|nRBC4E5saa	You mean like having an Olympic silver medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling face off against the World Sambo champion?  That's what happened when Matt Lindland faced Fedor Emelianenko in an MMA match.<br>  <br>  The closes we will have to what you're looking for are MMA matches.  If all you see is "gay", then that must be what you want to see.  I see top fighters in various disciplines fighting one another.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	One word...Sabaki...this is a high energy packed event with great stand up striking and sweeping skills.

Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit - Con G...step into the sabaki ring and let's see if you are still talking crap about them after they crack you with one of those kicks.

If you were in a fight with a jiu-jitsu student and it went to the ground, you'd get your @$$ kicked. Watch what you say.|`|ULgO4VaEaa	wwy cant we have real martial art question in this secion. <br>  when you can figure out the answer to my question you will have the answer to yours|`|fPoDxJL9aa	Because most of those martial arts masters are frauds.  They look so bad *** against untrained opponents or in a little competition where they need like 6 hits to win.  The other half of the masters can fight but the top ufc fighters in the dudes weight class will destroy any martial arts "master".  Breaking boards in a dojo, doing dragon kicks, "fighting" 3 people at a time is cool(if ur 12), but i would rather watch and do mma.  You guys should just keep going to your little karate classes and when you see and mma fighter tell him that mma is gay and challenge him to a fight.  And how he fights he does not stop after one landed hit like a little karate competition, he will hit you until your eyes roll back in your head.<br>  and for the guy that said mma is a pony show, traditional masters are a pony show, then do little bows, give little belts, do all this unpractical BS, MMA fighters actually fight and make big money to do it, you can call a man like chuck lidell  unskilled but he is a millionaire, get in the cage and fight you traditional martial arts fags<br>  <br>  check this master <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDaCIDvj6I"" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDaCIDvj...</a><br>  <br>  heres sabaki, this is a joke, one kick is landed and the fight stops, thats not fighting, oh i thought traditional martial arts was about being realistic and defending ones self<br>  In a fight if you land a hit you dont get a break, THEY CANT EVEN PUNCH IN THE FACE<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c_nz-VLCKw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c_nz-VLC...</a>|`|MaFw69ePaa	by real martial arts i assume u mean traditional. we have similar views on mma. i'd like to see traditional wushu masters duke it out on a lei tai. or two japanese martial artists fight in the tall grass in the country or in a dojo. even pankration masters dukin it out. i kno what u mean. idk where it all went but if u go to the origin of the art u can find dedicated artists who carry the tradition. i'd also like to see real muay thai, muay boran not throwin a knee and all of a sudden being a kruu or ajarn|`|apr9gsgjaa	REAL MARTIAL ARTS WERE DESIGNED TO KILL<br>  <br>  you cant turn it into a sport and expect it to be the same.<br>  <br>  plus a real martial arts fight would only last a few seconds and less if they were masters competing|`|Km9QC8a9aa	The two reasons that come to my mind are:<br>  <br>  Martial art masters do not degrade their art to assault.<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  Martial art masters do not put themselves on display for some sort of a "dog and pony show" in order to thrill the masses.

0Dm3WEMcaa	So because it's on TV it should be in the Television section? <br>  I see a misstep in logic because i bet all your favourite sports are on TV as well right?<br>  the WWE is more about acting than wrestling but professional wrestling done the way it's suppose to be, Ring of Honor wrestling for example, is the most physically demanding sport going. I don't care if you don't agree.<br>  <br>  *Edit* i agree with that to a degree what the WWE does at times barely counts as wrestling BUT this isn't the WWE section, it's all forms of wrestling from free style and grecko roman to the cartoon BS Vince pledals.

As far as USC they just got caught doin what all the big colleges do. And the reggie bush thing was all his agent not the school.|`|oAOUAVVAaa	Should the Steelers give back all their championships too? Supposedly some of their players took steroids.  That's cheating.  The Oakland Raiders back in the 70's made the NFL rewrite the rule book because they found loopholes in everything.  Should they forfeit all their victories during that decade?  How about Indianapolis, cried to the league office about the physicality of the Patriots during a playoff game, which ended up changing the pass interference rules.  Maybe they should forfeit all their victories this decade for being whiny little girls.  How about Seattle.  The reason the league made every helmet with a receiver in it have a green sticker on it, was because they were sending plays in to a number of players on the field through the receiver in the helmet, essentially cheating.<br>  <br>  And as far as USC paying players, who cares.  If you dig deep enough into EVERY college team, you will find improprieties.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Their reputation was only tarred for that moment they were caught with the spy gate.  The whole "spy gate" scandal did not prove they cheated in the past and even when the won their super bowls. It was only for that moment.  I think now many aren't thinking about it because again it didn't prove they cheated in past victories.  Had the evidence suggested they did cheat more than that time then yes, your policies would go into effect.  But the key is finding evidence.  If you have evidence they cheated in the past then it can be brought up and of course Beliechick would lose his job.  And sending the super bowl rings would do nothing.  The shame of cheating would be enough.  No need to waste money changing the rings.  So my point is, no evidence, no policies to be put in place, which means no prosecution.|`|AA12103453	Sounds like a good plan to me. I never questioned the Red Sox or Celtics, just tired of Boston.

2ISGwSK7aa	First round exit for the Halos again.<br>  <br>  Look for the A's to be there in September though.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I see Oakland not only challenging LA but also overtaking them.  Unfortunately for the division, it still won't make a difference in the postseason because the winner will play against either the AL East Champion or the Wild Card winner (also known as the AL East runner-up).|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Angels might take the division, but with their luck, they'd end up playing Boston in the first round AGAIN (seems like every year) and lose...again.|`|qYc5YcH5aa	angels will win it all|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	It's hard to say how they'd do in the postseason, but I think they can get there. If they have trouble winning their division, I can nearly guarantee the teams in the AL East would have them beat out for the Wild Card. The Angels loss Texeira and K-Rod, which will hurt. Abreu and Fuentes will help, but they're just not the same players. The A's have made improvements, with Matt Holliday, Orlando Cabrera and Giambi, so I think it's realistic to see them ending above .500, but I still don't know if they can compete with the Angels. The Angels have a title. Either they're too content with it, or they get too overwhelmed when it comes postseason time. When it comes to the Angels and Cubs, it's really hard to figure it out. In July, it'd seem like the most predictable World Series, but it never seems to happen. Than again though, look at how the Red Sox and White Sox won their titles in back-to-back years. Anything can happen.<br>  <br>  My guess is that the 1st place team is coming out of the AL East. My guess is that'll be the Red Sox. The Angels will take the AL West finishing 2nd, while the Twins will win the AL Central, finishing third and the Rays will win the Wild Card. If the Angels win their division, the most likely scenario will be that they'd have to play an AL East team in the ALDS, because two teams from the same division can't play eachother in the ALDS. The Angels have beaten the Yankees in the passed in the postseason, so if they're lucky enough to get them, I think they can beat them. We all know how A-Rod hits when it comes postseason time. If it's the Rays though, that'd be interesting. I see the World Series coming out of the NL this year though. There'll be a repeat of the '86 WS.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	I usually go with the Angels, but this season is definitely a toss up. Oakland has gotten a lot better, and the Angels on the other hand lost a couple of pieces. I say it's going to be competitive, but the division is definitely going to come down to between those two teams. Peace!|`|7X1H2AfWaa	maybe oakland can make it, because they added matt holliday, jason giambi and have justin duscherer and jack cust. the angels lost frankie rodriguez and mark teixeira. they got fuentes. i think that the A's will win 84 games and lose 78, whereas the angels win 87 and lose 75. but if the angels make it, i certainly think theyll get out in the first round.
6vzpHTqQaa	The Tigers need health on their side first.  Verlander needs to overcome the problems he had last year and the Tigers need a healthy Jeremy Bonderman in the rotation, as well as an effective Dontrelle Willis and Joel Zumaya.

I may even react with a palm strike to the face in place of the elbow. <br>  <br>  Of course, self defense situations are never perfect. So as long as I react fast and do whatever comes naturally (that is how I train) .. then I will be satisfied.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Hit first, hit hard, hit a lot. Don't stop till they go down.  Don't worry about specific moves or targets, let it come naturally.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	i would do what i had to do depending on the situation|`|gBO908P6aa	First of all you CAN pick a fight, just not physically!  Use words to provoke the other person into coming at you.  That way you are justified in either calling the cops and/or thrashing him to a pulp.  <br>  <br>  I have two choices, either back down or if push comes to shove, maintain distance and don't engage him.  Only verbal kung fu to try to argue back with provocation or defuse the situation.  99% of the time, he'll back off once you have reason on your side.  Remember the tongue is sharper than the sword and with the right words, you can cut through someone like a knife.   This is something I learned from my old man.  I've seen him literally stop aggressors dead in their tracks using nothing more than his cold stare and his words alone.  That's the REAL Kung Fu that most people ever talk about. <br>  <br>  If he does come to me, legally I'd be justified to react at that point because he's crossed the line and made a visible threat to harm me.  If I am pressed to the point where I have to react, I'd have to commit 150%.  No holds, I want to get him away from me and me as far as possible.  One thing that I've done in the past is use environmental objects to my advantage - walking around cars, around fire hydrants, between people or poles or trash bags lying on the sidewalk.  Anything that will make it tougher for him to get to me.    If there are people around, attract attention and create a commotion so the attacker is embarrassed.  Maybe a cop will show up.  Basically buy time and outsmart him with your brains.  <br>  <br>  I once backed away from an advancing trio of toughs, right into the middle of the street.  When they tried to follow me, they were met with cars and angry honking horns.  Meanwhile I already cross gingerly to the other side.  They decided not to follow me and stayed on their side of the street.  That's the kind of environmental weapons that I'm talking about.  <br>  <br>  In the event that I do have to engage, I'd make sure there is as much room as possible and go with my instinct.  Stop kick to jam his advancement etc to buy time and hurt him.  Most average joes on the street do not know how to defend low attacks so my prime targets are always going to be shins, knees, toes, etc.  <br>  <br>  If it's so bad that I have to face more than one...run as fast and far as possible to space them apart.  Find and improvise a weapon to keep them at bay and increase my chances.|`|agun6wcEaa	My Martial arts is Capoeira a Brazilian Martial arts that is very Intimidating martial arts! So usuaully people back off because of our spinning kicks! They might get hit. And I also do Pi Qua Quan, which are very powerful wind mill like movements! That are very strong! The avarage person that starts a fight usually shoves or punches when a hand gets anywhere near you in a fight I would use lecki(like a wind mill with my arms) I would move the arm away Counterclock wise and push the punch away and strike them in the neck, but if I couldn't strike them in the neck and they blocked it. then I would hit them in the ribs as hard as I can with a Martelo(Basic side ways kick that most martial arts use)<br>  <br>  When the other person starts the fight I would fake a punch and kick him in the ribs with Martelo and there head would go down. From there I would either  Knee them, or do vermalo ( like when you kick someones butt when there walking next to you, you lift your leg up)<br>  <br>  then Armanda(Spinning kick) then they should be out. But most fights dont go as there predicted and aren't as pretty as in movies or games. They can be if your a good Martial artist! =]]]|`|KzCqLkTEaa	if you can't walk away, TAKE OUT THEIR KNEES SO THEY CAN'T WALK AWAY.<br>  <br>  hehehe<br>  if you watch street fights, they try to punch the face while their torso and their head leans back to prevent them from getting hit. When they do that, they have to get close. So i would go for a swift solid kick to the outside/inside of the knee or the inner thigh, then go in kneeing them to the middle of the chest.<br>  you could always sweep kick them.<br>  or if you are fast enough and pretty experienced, you can spin hook kick them as they come in.<br>  or, if you know how, you can catch their arm/hand during the punch, put their wrist/elbow into a lock, bring them to their knees, and knee them in the face.<br>  OR pull out a gun and shoot.|`|Ar2o3P37aa	If they are drunk or kind of messed up I always wait for the inevitable wild swing and get ready to turn the corner.  I like to hit to the body first, usually people go right to the face, but I think a lot of times, unless you hit them just right it isn't always the best to headhunt.  A hard liver shot, or a hit to the sternum/gut almost always slows 'em down, and then it is time to work the head.  Taking someone down, getting the back, and setting up the rear naked choke is the best though, no damage but total domination.  I do like to hit the jaw, but I like to soften them up first.  I don't mean to sound like I fight all of the time, I have been in a few fights though.  Once guys at parties find out that I train they all become tough guys and want to beat up the fighter.|`|kouW3lckaa	i would let them make the first move, they would probably swing a punch, i would grab their arm and twist it around into an arm lock. i would shove them forwards and throw a round-house kick into their temple.i rekon that would knock most people out, if it dosent i would throw a double-round house kick.<br>  <br>  <br>  i would only do this if i was in a dangerous situation, ie if someone was trying to seriously hurt me, the best option is always to run away.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	It depends on the situation.

0qNbEif3aa	Excellent move for Pittsburgh. Perfect fit on Sid's line. Moving Staal up to the 1st line was about as good as it could get for the Pens before looking for a big smart player to get to the net. But now with Guerin in the line up, Staal can remain centering his own line (where he should be), possibly with Kunitz who he has had great chemistry with so far, and Guerin can take over the 1st line position. <br>  <br>  Guerin's point totals may not be super impressive thus far this season, but you need to look at it this way. He was playing for the Islanders for one. And two, he lead the team in shots. A player who can take shots and go to the net is a perfect fit for a Crosby line mate, and I can see the two putting up some serious points in the playoffs this year.<br>  <br>  That's right. I said in the playoffs. This year! <br>  <br>  BTW one more thought... if I was one of the top 3 teams in the East I would be very worried about ending up playing the Pens in the first round. They will be dangerous and I can see them taking any of those teams (except maybe Boston, but possible).|`|XuGFt3boaa	I though it was a very good move for the Pens.  They picked up a very skilled player that has a lot of experience both during the regular season and in the postseason.  He'll do great in the top line with Kunitz and Crosby.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	I feel it was a great low risk move.  Better yet, since Kunitz is meshing so well with Staal, it would allow him to stay on a line with Staal while teaming Guerin with Crosby.|`|c69svim5aa	AWESOME!<br>  <br>  LETS GO PENS!|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Very good move.

Adding offensively skilled players like Guerin and Kunitz, along with the return of Gonchar and the imminent return of Crosby greatly improves the offense.  The addition of Craig Adams will add solid play to the 3rd and 4th lines as well<br>  <br>  I think this is a great move for the Penguins.  He is far less selfish than Satan, and should fit in a lot better.  This move certainly makes Pittsburgh better than they were 24 hours ago..|`|lYnkvRASaa	All of a sudden if I am Boston, Washington or Jersey, I start hoping the Pens make it up to 5th place at least in the standings.

If I am one of the top teams I don't want to see them in the 6,7,8 spot and have to face them in round 1.<br>  <br>  Bob, yeah I forgot Philly's games in hand,  I hope we can keep that spot (5th).  Iw would be nice to see pens/Caps in round one.  Imagine all the Ovechkin vs Crosby Questions.<br>  <br>  So far Philly have not sold out the prospect farm.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Isles get a conditional draft pick.

Not everyone out of work is a construction worker...  And who's to say that when the new Vikings stadium job is bidded out it won't be bid out to a company not based in Minneapolis?    <br>  <br>  There are far more important ways to spend $500+ million dollars in Minneapolis right now than to build the Vikings a stadium (for example, the roads in and around Minneapolis are in terrible condition and have been for years).  Maybe the Vikings should have thought ahead a little bit and worked out a deal to share one of the 2 other brand new sports stadiums being built in Minneapolis right now with the Twins or the Golden Gophers?  I can't see any politician in Minneosta successfully pitching a 3rd new sports stadium in 5 years using public dollars considering how poorly the economy is doing right now and how everyone is eating it concerning things like jobs, home values, 401Ks etc.|`|PMluTf72aa	in the short term, your idea is beneficial.  in the long term, it's not beneficial.  as you know, the more money people make, the more money people spend, thus improving the economy.  however, if this idea is put to action, everything will settle again a couple years from now just as it is today and the results hurt the American Government, but benefit the Minnesota Vikings.  basically, you're draining funds from the Government which is already limited as we speak.  if the government does anything like this, it will be under the notion of generating more money in the long run for stability, not just in the near future.  If the Vikings want a new stadium, they should go to the city like every other team to get the money, resulting in higher tax paying dollars in the Twin Cities area.  if the city refuses to build a new stadium, then you'll see the Vikings move.  it comes with the business.|`|b8a8e5201f9639e1a17da8bca5952504aa	Good idea, who cares about the millions unemployed people who lost their jobs this year, The Vikings are allot more important!

If they asked for money it would get rejected because they are their own organization and shouldn't have made a new stadium if they didn't have the money. They can pay for the workers on their own and  if the government gave them their own stimulus package it would only benefit the Vikings and put the country in more debt.<br>  <br>  If anything the NFL should be putting money into this economy. They are one of the richest organizations and only help with a select few charities.|`|VTN4Qun9aa	Oh definitely, our number one priority as a nation right now should be making sure that the Vikings don't move and building new stadiums in areas that don't really have the population to warrant them.

With Brendon Morrow out the Stars have had nobody willing to park in front of the opposing net minder and take abuse which is how you score goals. They have plenty of scoring skill but few are willing to take the punishment necessary to score in those hard areas and adding a big body like Morrison may really help this problem. Turco has already started playing well again and once some of the injured players begin to come back the Stars will be a force in the West this postseason.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Dallas Star yes<br>  NHL star- not anymore.<br>  <br>  Interesting, I'm not sure what it means for Begin, probably more pressbox time as Morrison has more offensive upside.<br>  <br>  Both are UFA's I think so both will be competing for playing time to showcase themselves for next year with either the Stars or one of the other teams.<br>  <br>  Probably a good move for Dallas in that they now have 2 hungry motivated guys.|`|lVOkCSbyaa	Pick up a vet for nada? Not bad if you ask me. I know Morrison and Begin aren't really top 6 forwards but when it comes down to it we need to fill holes that are only temporary. We managed not to sacrifice the future in sending away any young stars (although I did like Janik) and we put someone in with a little grit. <br>  <br>  When Morrow and Richards and Peterson get back we'll have to reconsider Begin and Morrison and their roles on the team.

Football would be next following by track & field, then it's whatever is available.  The one segment of basketball I detest is the NBA.

I haven't followed hocked for a long time however recently I have been half listening to the Blues games while I am working and have started to get a little interest since they are playing better the past two months than they have in the past few years.

I haven't watched basketball seriously for 10 years, and hockey, what's that?<br>  <br>  This is the worst time of the year for me. Winter is dragging on, and the only sport that I seem to hear about is basketball. It is basically rammed down our throats by ESPN. I love baseball, it is like a new beginning for those of us who live in cold weather areas. I look for any news of baseball I can find. I like to follow all the teams, all the hot prospects who will soon be making an impact, old faces in new places, and how the divisions stack up.<br>  <br>  Because of NCAA basketball, we will be totally immersed in "March Madness". For those of us who don't care at all for college basketball,it is annoying because it takes attention away from baseball, which used to be the dominant sport here. To me, it is just part of the "filler" between baseball seasons", and when "March Madness" is finally over, baseball can finally get some attention.  I think that sports are cyclical. Eventually, baseball will rise again. The powers that be will come to their senses and stop postseason games from starting at 8:45, and that more people will get to see the excitement of playoff and World Series games.|`|ZatADRPXaa	I'm a baseball fan first.

SMX228Olaa	I think that they have a really good shot, they almost made the play-offs last season and they have already been improving there defense for next season re-signing DeAngelo Hall and signing Albert Haynsworth. Not to mentiun they already have Jason Taylor up there on the D-line who is a duel threat because he can play linebacker aswell.|`|PVMsr2Faaa	One guy does not guarantee a playoff. Look at Taylor from last year, kind of bust, wouldn't you say. <br>  <br>  Their offense line really needs to be looked after. You can have the best QB in world but with no protection, they look mediocre. Or you can have a mediocre QB but with a good OL they are great. Remember the 91 season.<br>  <br>  They were off to a good start last season and faltered when it counted.|`|t6c1WmWoaa	Dude, I may be biased because I'm an eagles fan, but no.

u3FqxhY8aa	Before the Australian Open I may have said Roddick, but now that he is back in everyone's mind as a title contender (not a slam contender still quite yet, but getting there) I won't pick him.<br>  Otherwise I may pick someone like Nikolay Davydenko, now that I have to know tennis much more I certainly don't like him, but despite what many thinks he is pretty good.  He is 5'10 and 154 lbs yet stands (and has stood for a very long time) as a top 5 player in the world during a time of giant tennis players dominating.  He has climbed to as high as #3 in the world yet how often do you hear something suggesting that Nikolay will win any big tournaments.  While I am one of those people he is very underestimated considering his size and what he is capable of when he is confident and healthy.<br>  One other ATP top 10 player who I don't feel like I hear as much as I thought I would about is Juan Martin Del Potro.  The guy like just turned 20 and has a career high of number 6.  He could still grow as much as Murray did last year (and Murray was like #10 or #9 in the world, small difference it would seem, but just one ranking in the top 10 is a very big deal).  Juan still has chances to go far in the French Open and at Wimbledon for more points, although he sure does have his work cut out for him in order to defend all of those points that he won over the summer.<br>  On the WTA tour Vera Zvonareva is pretty underestimated it seems despite the fact that she went to the finals in the tour championships and the semifinals in Australia.  Sabine Lisicki is kind of underestimated considering she hasn't done to much to deserve a ton of stuff.  But as one of the many up and coming new generation members of the WTA she seems to be underestimated (although admittedly players like Victoria Azarenka and Caroline Wozniacki seem to have more potential as of now, but neither of these two are really underestimated).|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well i think the most underestimated female is elena demeteva because people once thought her serve was sooo weak and she could not cause any damage..<br>  <br>  for males would be andy roddick because he is more of a one shot deall.. and he totally revolves around his serve... and is a one slam wonder from a lifetime ago almost|`|KReWaGFsaa	Definitely NOT Andy Murray.

She has been ranked 2nd in lots of majors (sometimes she is put on untelivised courts at #2 during slams like court 18!). The commentators always bag on her.. it's always the rotten achievements never the good ones.

QIWvbNFWaa	he'll probably asked for his release|`|HMv6jvUCaa	He will be a back up again this year, unless Kurt Warner really starts struggling.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't surprise me if they traded him either|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I feel the Cards will regret its decision to go with Warner over Leinart.   Everyone is intoxicated over a quarterback who is at the end of his career and declared a "star" by the sportswriters.   The handling of this quarterback situation was a chance for Cards management to gamble big on the future with Leinart.   The Cards organization and hardcore supporters are just not giving enough credit to their Division schedule where it was 6-0 vs 9-7 overall in the regular season.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	He will be waiting for his turn, much like Aaron Rodgers did when Brett Favre kept playing...<br>  <br>  There will be no renewal at the end of this 2 year deal for Kurt, short of winning the Super Bowl...That would be the exception...|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	A definite no confidence vote for Leinart for the Cards to sign a 38 year old QB to a 2 year deal worth $23 million.|`|HNE7dJQiaa	same thing, backup|`|4cUwYzqgaa	He will be the backup...plain and simple. He still has a future, and after Warner leaves, they will give him another chance, if absolutely nothing else, someone else will, he was drafted as high as he was because he had, and still has, potential, therefore no matter what happens he will get more chances.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	He will go down in history as one of the greatest QB draft busts, next to Ryan Leaf and Akili Smith....haha the only difference is that those guys tried and genuinely sucked, Leinart never even tried, he got stuck partying it up in Hollywood.|`|eypjP9Hqaa	He will probably seek a trade and if that dooesn't work out I could see him being released.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	In two years he will go to seattle and replace matt hasselback|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	He will be a backup for the next 2 years.
P1bO87l1aa	I have been following baseball for over 50 years and there is no way to tell.  I have seen team on fire in spring training and die when the season started and the reserve has also happened.  There is really no way to tell.  Also I have seen teams do really good in spring training and carry it on into the season.  There is just no way to tell.This year, like 2006 with some team minus players playing in the WBC it makes the picture even fuzzier to see who is good and who is not.  The same goes for players some look great in March but can't do anything when the season starts.  Spring training is a time to watch baseball for the fun of it.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Spring training games mean nothing...They're just practice...And they rarely are accurate in projecting the kind of season teams will have...|`|u1T5TQP7aa	well as my dad says spring training games may not count but it is a good foreshadow into the regular season, during spring training i think that hitters are ahead of the pitchers as well<br>  <br>  hitting in this case wins the spring training games, but once the regular season starts pitchers are at the top of their game and that overall wins games, it all depends on how you are offensively and defensively<br>  <br>  overall, spring training is a good outlook on the regular season|`|hMkb7H31aa	Spring Training is just that - training.  The won-loss record has a lower priority than during the 162 game season.  Toward the end, managers and coaches try to instill a winning attitude in the players along with more strategically managing the games.  That way, when going into the regular season, the change of scenery, size of the ballparks and colder weather has minimal impact on the players attitude in performing.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	There is absolutely no correlation between spring training games and what a team will do when the season starts.  Spring training games are there to get in shape and to take a good look at the young players, many of which none of us no anything about.  It is possible that, in some spring training games, none of the players on the field will be with the team on opening day.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	You should try to look in the record books through the internet.<br>  The only benefit that you may come up with is, tracking where those players who played on those teams that captured your curiosity.|`|GM63jFD2aa	During spring training, teams play all of their players regardless of their skill levels. Some team members that will be benched most or all of the season play during spring training. A team playing their first string players in spring training may be putting them up against another teams third string players. In spring training, it's more about training everyone and seeing how good everyone does vs. trying to win. So yeah, some teams will do great in spring training and suck during the regular season. Others will do horrible during spring training and do good in the regular season. I think it's more shocking to see a team do good in the regular season having not done good in spring training.|`|ZatADRPXaa	Spring training standings are meaningless, but there are so many seasons and teams to choose from that you have to find some examples that work.<br>  <br>  eg - <br>  Spring training 2007, Tampa was last in the Grapefruit League, 10-19-2<br>  Spring training 2008, Tampa was first in the Grapefruit League, 18-8-2|`|KR1FdEZgaa	spring training is a cut or keep. nothing more.

You have many choices!|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	try short distance sprints|`|lcpLAS3Kaa	Swimming won't use the same leg muscles, but is good for staying in shape. It is a cardio work out so whenever you are able to run again, you won't be out of shape or become tired easily, you just might have a few sore muscles. Also doing sit ups and crunches to work on your core muscles actually is helpful in improving your running times. I pray that I never become injured because I love running/track. Hopefully you recover in time for cross country.|`|xRyGMuXeaa	i understand that ur passion is track, but dont let it bum u out so much.<br>  Maybe run on ur own free time when u heal.

XQoH9ZI5aa	Last place DOES NOT ensure the first pick. You should scroll down and read a question asked today about how the draft lottery works. (there is a lottery)<br>  <br>   Personally, I think the current system is fine.....however an argument can be made as to why a team gets essentially punished for winning. Why should winning the cup hinder your chance for the best player available the following year will be some people's argument. Not mine though. The current system is good.<br>  <br>   BTW, if the Leafs were trying to lose, Kaberle and the rest of them would have been traded........they would have taken the offer they recieved for Schenn last week (for a lottery pick) and CuJo would be starting for the duration (or Pogge).<br>  <br>   Also, losing at this point is winning. It happens in every sport, baseball prospects come up and start games, football players shut it down with minor injuries, hell, the Celtics would put their bench on the floor for the entire second half 2 years ago and guess what, they finished last and the lottery bit them.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AswCvUF5cjiL8imEX1DeliBkFwx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304093444AAgrdHi">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	They picked up a stopgap goaltender without giving up a draft pick; not a bad move.<br>  <br>  There is a lottery of sorts already; I'd say the system works pretty well.<br>  <br>  They could still move up a few spots in the draft; if they don't get Tavares, Schenn's younger brother would be a nice pickup if he's an option.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Actually picking up Gerber shows they haven't given up. If they were tanking, they would have stuck with Pogge. <br>  <br>  There is a lottery involving all the teams that don't make the playoffs, by the way. A team can move up 4 places max if they win it.<br>  cdn- wasn't trying to copy. I was late by 30 seconds,lol.|`|lYnkvRASaa	There still is a Lottery,<br>  <br>  If they were trying to tank, they would not have picked up Gerber.  They would have went with Joseph and Pogge.<br>  <br>  Gerber may surprise, he has better numbers than Jose Theodore this year.  He is the guy that led ottawa to such a great start last year.<br>  <br>  Edit LL, its okay I pretty much said what Bob said without reading his answer first.|`|AA10068004	Totally disagree because it sounds like your saying that just because you or other fans may merely suspect they are throwing games in exchange for a high pick the rules need to be changed. That's priceless...|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Personally, I'm thinking that Ottawa waiving Gerber to go with an inexperienced goaltender in Elliot shows that losing is more important to them.<br>  <br>  Gerber has been to 3 Stanley Cup finals in the last 6 seasons (no other goaltender can claim that).<br>  Gerber led the Hurricanes to 2nd in the East in 2006 winning 38 games (out of 60 starts) and last year he won 30 games (out of 57).  <br>  <br>  Gerber has won more than 50% of his NHL starts (including this year), the Leafs are looking at him as an improvement, otherwise they would have gone with the duo of Pogge and Joseph....which they have chosen not to do.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Wouldn't it p!ss everyone off if Gerber lead them to the playoffs?<br>  <br>    Gerber being re-packaged??

Y3KMLdjWaa	Do to the nature of a time trial you need to fully warmed up prior to the start. If not what happens is you go out hard then around the 5 mile mark (about 15 min.) you fall off pace as your body adapts to the pace.<br>  Stretch ride there or what ever, but with a TT you should know your start time. When preparing for a time trial effort, start your warm up one hour before your start time.  Your actual riding time will be 45 minutes but you must factor in a bathroom break(s) and enough time to get to the start line. You should also have your energy drink readily available during your warm up routine.   <br>  <br>  The warm-up is a series of progressively higher intensity efforts designed to activate the energy systems used during your race, including those for the production, buffering, and clearing of lactic acid. Your warm-up should go as follows: <br>  <br>  Your total warm-up time is 46 minutes, and the first 20 minutes consist of an endurance-intensity spin at 85-95rpm; this can be done either on the road or on the trainer. Then:<br>  <br>  10 minutes Tempo, 75-85rpm<br>  2 minutes Recovery <br>  6 minutes ramping SteadyState 90-95rpm at or just below   lactate  threshold<br>  2 minutes Recovery<br>  2 minutes PowerIntervals, 105rpm<br>  2 minutes Recovery                                <br>  2 minutes PowerIntervals, 105rpm<br>  2 minutes Recovery<br>  <br>  Now you are ready.|`|l5cxmTb9aa	10 miles is very short. You need to be warmed up and ready to hit it from the start. Do a nice easy spin to get the blood flowing then try to get your heartrate up so your body is ready. If someone has a trainer you can borrow that would be nice too.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	An eight mile ride will be a good warm up if you time it right.  Don't get there too early and take your time getting there.  You can do some stretching before the race.
vzH7f7V5aa	I don't think so.|`|GswnLKtQaa	It's only fair. Spurs will be without Duncan and the Cavs without Wallace (he broke a leg againts the rockets). Tony Parker has been incredible for the past few games, 37 points and then 39 points and 9 assist. If the Cavs wants to win they have to shutdown Parker.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I don't know. I would love the see him playing, because I'm a big fan of his.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	It's undetermined if he'll play. Parker has been playing so good that my guess is they won't risk it.<br>  <br>  Go Cavs!|`|nfNuphJQaa	coach greg doesn't want to sacrifice or parlay his best player.|`|F05yVezraa	Nah parker and Manu will take over|`|0eSS5YhEaa	duncan and wallace are on the same level? are you an idiot?

With hard work you improve but without any training you can't expect everyone to walk off the street and destroy everyone.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about competition then again you should be able to enter as long as you meet the requirements. These requirements are in place for your protection and their insurance. If you don't meet them it's reasonable to deny your entry. It isn't discrimination and saying that it is quite frankly shows a lot of ignorance.<br>  <br>  And speaking of ignorance... isn't there really only one race?|`|Km9QC8a9aa	You are confusing "their discrimination" with your incompetence.<br>  <br>  They are merely exercising a little CYA in order to prevent future lawsuits.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	You need to get stronger and more skilled.

Aren't you the same guy who claimed MMA fighters only fought in MMA because they weren't boxers?<br>  <br>  The real answer is that anyone who pays is allowed in an MMA gym.

Discrimination toward or against a person or group is the treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit. Surely being weak is based on individual merit? Do you have some sort of illness? In that case MMA isn't for you. These guys are right. Any physical requirements they want you to pass isn't unreasonable. They're put in place for your safety and wellbeing. <br>  <br>  And troll isn't a racial slur. Troll in Internet slang, is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant or off-topic messages in an online community, They're not a seperate race, that are seen as inferior.

DOVbF4Piaa	Look for a hybrid bike with 700c tires or a comfort/ pathway bike with 26" tires.   They will have a more upright sitting position then a mountain or road bike.

bszyOuIqaa	I don't condone violence but the best way to beat anyone especially someone bigger than you is to use wits. You have to be smart to not get your *** kicked!  Every fighter has a weakness (even the best) so you have to notice that maybe he always leaves his left side unprotected, that's when you hit him there.  <br>  <br>  Always protect yourself. Don't hit someone and just stand there as if they won't hit you back. Remember that hitting someone makes them VERY angry and they will be coming for you once you get a good shot in. Get as many shots in as you possibly can. Make them count! <br>  <br>  Stick and MOVE...always always protect yourself. Good luck|`|XkBzfEBUaa	use his actions to your advantage<br>  if he lunges at you, dodge out of the way and use his momentum against him, like slamming him against a wall or something<br>  <br>  if he's bigger than you, go for an immediate chop block to the legs....then while he's on the ground, kick or punch until he stops making sounds<br>  <br>  using other people's anger against them is always a sure fire way to get bullies in the end|`|LnJjS8BRaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuojOqgiZbhPk5qqh6K2lwtNxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090303132225AADI1eQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  The above is a link to a question someone asked.

Otherwise, take your beating like a man.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I recommend avoiding him till things cool off.  You can tell any authorities you like, as the others have suggested, but this guy is just going to deny it when they talk to him.<br>  <br>  If you do get stuck in the fight, fight dirty.  He's bigger, and stronger, don't try to muscle him.  Kick him in the shins, bite, poke eyes, squeeze nuts, whatever it takes to keep you from getting hurt until the fight is broken up (usually about 10 seconds in school).  Also, draw attention to the situation if its looking like the fight is going to happen.  A crowd gathering around will signal to the faculty that something is about to happen.  Who knows, maybe they'll get in there and break things up before anything can?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I think the mistake that everyone makes trying to answer a question like this is that they believe that you WANT to fight.  Thats like someone asking "what do I do if my car skids on ice", and everyone answering "don't drive on ice".  It won't matter what authorities this kid talks to, it won't matter what he does to avoid the fight, if he ends up in it he needs to know how to avoid getting hurt.  There's nothing wrong with not fighting, I'm a big supporter of not fighting.  But once a fight starts, not fighting isn't an option (unless you like the feel of fists on your face).

mG2BCZe7aa	The Sonics have definitely deserved playing the Chicago Bulls in the finals for a number of reasons:<br>  <br>  1. They were no. 1 in the west after finishing with 64-18 record behind only Chicago's 72-10 record.<br>  <br>  2. Great wins against Sacramento, defending champs Houston Rockets and a grueling match-up against Karl Malone's Jazz even going the distance. This same Jazz team would eventually meet Chicago two straight times in the Finals, something a stronger roster like the Lakers couldn't hold off (they were eliminated 2 straight times by the Jazz) the Sonics did.<br>  <br>  3. Validated their no. 1 seeding this time burying the hatchet of the humiliating loss against Denver 2 years prior to this appearance.<br>  <br>  4. It was the highlight of George Karl's coaching philosophy. George would coach them to the post season each of the seasons from 1991-1998, The finals is the peak.<br>  <br>  Kemp have been a steady power behind the Sonics rise together with his stalwarts Payton, Shrempf, Hershey Hawkins and Sam Perkins. It was therefore sad that the Sonics did an anti-climatic move that ruined Shawn's career when they signed Jim McIlvaine. You see, after Shawn Kemp spent the entire summer of 96 posturing for a new contract, the Sonics ignored him and instead spent their money on another big white stiff named Jim McIlvaine. They gave him a five year $35 million contract based on “potential”. By signing McIlvaine to a higher salary than they were paying Kemp, they totally angered both Kemp and his teammate Gary Payton and caused a team that was on the verge of wining an NBA championship to implode. Jim would go on to be a complete bust averaging a tremendous 2.7 points and 3.1 rebounds during his joke-like career.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Seattle was the 2nd best team that year, They eliminated the Defending Champion by sweeping them in the 2nd round.<br>  <br>  Gary Payton also won the Defensive Player of the the award.

If Edge can be a World Champion 8 times in 3-4 years, that tells you the worth of the World Title he carries. For the most part, his title wins just seem to be an addition to how his gimmick is played out.|`|zhH36xEHaa	I do believe he is one of the greats of our generation, just watch the Hardcore rules match between Edge Mick Foley and Lita vs. Terry Funk Tommy Dreamer and Beulah at ECW one night stand, one of the greatest (and most gruesome) matches I've ever seen. <br>  <br>  However, when u get to the 8 titles in 3-4 years part, I have to agree thats a bit much, but I guess thats what has become of WWE.

13e9491d1d8eba47511ebc47e18c8ad5aa	no submission can be escaped once it is locked in correctly. once any lock or choke is locked in you give up, break or pass out|`|4gwSrPhfaa	no submission is impossible to get out of, however once its locked in and already doing damage its to late, the RNC is a very fighttable  even when full locked in, as long as u keep ur chin tucked in u have a fighting chance, i once got put in a really tight RNC, i couldn't grasp his hands so instead i pushed his knees down , getting him to cross his feet and i then threw my own feet over, arched, and pushed down, and got the ankle lock :), so no submission is impossible to escape  however the sooner u do it the easier it is,|`|gBO908P6aa	I would think so too....at least not without a weapon in hand to fight back.  Once the RNC is firmly set in, and you have no footing or you're on your belly or on the ground, and you're getting squeezed, it's next to impossible to break out of.  <br>  But then again any submission, firmly and properly set, is going to be near impossible to break out of.<br>  <br>  Edit: Triangles can still be defeated.  People with shorter limbs, limited flexibility will have a harder time securing the lock if they don't have a proper angle.   Having a good lock/choke is half the equation but properly positioning yourself and immobilizing the opponent's choices of limbs and his stability is the other half of the equation to making a situation impossible to break out of.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Once a sub is locked in it is a break, tear, pass out or tap out. If some one gets out of it then it was not locked in all of the way.<br>  <br>  Now you are saying the RNC but that is not totally true because it is not the choke itself that makes it so hard to get out of. it is the position of the submission. If some one has your back and pulling your head back and arching your back by pushing their hips in to you your whole body is not alingned and makes it very hard to do anything, period. If some one has the RNC in with poor body positioning it is actually pretty easy to get out of.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	There are many ways out of a rear naked choke.  As they tighten it, it gets harder and harder, but there are a number of methods to do so.  I can't think of anything that's actually impossible to get out of, given a person's will, and their willingness to take damage.<br>  <br>  Remember that UFC fight where the guy broke his own arm getting out of the arm bar?  That was cool :-)|`|73nTYgdraa	Wrong on all of you! The impossible technique is the Triangle leg choke.<br>  Once that is in you can't escape! Unlike with the RNC, from which i have escaped from enough to guarantee that it is NOT impossible.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Once a submission is locked on, they're all pretty impossible to get out of.  They key is to keep them from getting locked on.  If someones position is good, there is no escape.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	no, rnc has a pretty high percentage of escape ie tuck chin into the air pocket in the elbow crease, look away from the choke, peel the back hand off, both hands in the elbow crease and pull down, push up violently on the elbow of the choking arm, the list goes on...I would say in general the hardest submission to counter is either a clock choke or if the guy has a really good triangle its impossible to get out, ie eddie bravo submitting royler gracie at the abu dabis by a slow, well calculated triangle..|`|7FktMvdkaa	wrong. in any fight you can always change your position you just have to find the way. no matter how impossible it seems

dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	UFC and MMA events are not tournaments at all. They are different.<br>  <br>  The Arnold Classic held every year in March in Columbus Ohio plays to almost every single system of martial art out there. That is a tournament. Most tournaments are aimed at particular systems but many have different divisions that separate systems like TKD from Karate and Jujitsu from Judo and so forth. Good luck.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	It's called the UFC, open to any style... if you aren't a well rounded fighter your chances of winning aren't great.<br>  <br>  The UFC is just one example of MMA.

ai6ZGa21aa	no not a good idea at all. 1st if you spend that little amount on a bike you will get a heap that will brake down all the time an that's if any of it will work in the first place. to get a bike of medium quality you need to spend at least ￡200. anything under that will be a waste of your money an time. 2nd do not buy off the net as you will have to build an set up the bike yourself. having a bike built properly is what gives it its life span as most bikes come with buckles an damages in delivery. i would recommend getting it built by a bike shop mechanic an set up properly. 3rd you say the size is 26inch. that is the wheel size not the frame size yea you need a 26inch wheel but what frame size do you need? <br>  the best thing you could do is to go to a proper bike shop who can size you up properly on the bike and you get to sit on different models an see what you like best also they would build an set it up properly as well as giving you advice on how to use an care for your bike an m,ost also offer a free servce for you to come back an get it checked.|`|JyR2ENkVaa	Don't forget "you get what you pay for". I would go to my local bike shop and see what they have for good used bikes. You may get a really good bike for your money and you'll also have a place to go for local service. They will treat you well and also you'll find new friends to ride with.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5UIdcMgIaa	There is always a risk...<br>  So I guess no!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You don't want to buy a bike that only costs 69 pounds.

17cmDNyGaa	Yes, in all of fantasy sports the totals for the week listed all accumulate.<br>  <br>  So if your opp. has no games on any particular day, that just means he won't get any stats that day, but he will throughout the rest of the week.  At the end of the week, the winner of the most catagories will get the win.  I am not sure how your league is set up, but scores may be tallied either by a weekly win (So if you win more catagories in the week then your 1-0)... or points could be accumulated by how many stat catagories you won that week. (Example, you won Hits, RBI's, Stolen Bases... your opp. won HR's  and Runs scored - then your record would be 3-2 and your opponents would be 2-3.)<br>  <br>  ESPN Is pretty good but as far as ease of use I'd say Yahoo gets the credit for that. I've found yahoo is much more friendly on the eyes than all the other sites.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|69BwydjVaa	Well first off i never have played on ESPN before so i am not sure how that site is.  I do all my fantasy sports through CBS.  I have had no problems with them before.<br>  <br>  There is two types of head to head leagues.  Points and catagories.  The points leagues just means whichever team scores more points for the league gets the win.  You would score points based on Singles, Doubles etc.. for hitting and also wins, save, Ks etc.. for pitching.<br>  <br>  A catagory league is when you try to score the most for each catagory.  Example.  who ever has the most HRs for the week between the two teams wins that catagory.  And whichever team wins the most catagories wins the week.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  I have been playing fantasy sports for about 10 years.
xQFWjFyZaa	Baseball is much different than Football. In Football, there is one position that usually outproduces everyone else(RB). <br>  <br>  In Baseball, hitting is generally more valuable than pitching, mainly because hitters are everyday players. The top hitters go first(Pujols, A-Rod, Hanley, etc.), because they are great at what they do. The more things a player is good at, the more valuable they are. For example, Hanley Ramirez is a 30 HR/30 Steal guy, which is why he is more valuable than everyone else.<br>  <br>  While drafting in the early rounds, you want to try to grab guys that play weaker positions. SS is a weak position, which makes Rollins, Reyes, and Ramirez even more valuable. If you are not lucky enough to get them, you may end up with JJ Hardy as your SS, which is a big step down. SS, 2nd 3rd, and Catcher are the weakest positions(least amount of depth), but it is alright to wait on a Catcher...most people do. <br>  <br>  One basic rule is, you should never take a RP in the early rounds. Francisco Rodriguez doesn't have that big of an edge on Broxton or Fuentes because they pitch 4 innings at most in a week, and thats 4-5 Ks. That doesn't help your overall total much. Closers are really only good for Saves, and ERA. And you can find that anywhere.<br>  <br>  I hope that made sense. It's a bit tough to explain in simple terms, when it's really a bit complicated. You will learn with experience like the rest of us, and your experience with Football should ease the transition. Baseball is much more difficult than Football. There are more positions, more games, more injuries, etc. You really have to learn to work the waiver wire to be successful with Baseball. <br>  <br>  I could go on all day....lol. Let me know if you didn't understand and I'll try to do a little better job.|`|0kEc1aJgaa	take the best available player, and draft Shortstops and 2nd basemen in the first few rounds|`|287ryVgFaa	Doesnt matter the position... Usually people draft power hitters first, and wait until later rounds to draft pitching.
r5AMG8g7aa	It is not likely that any Tsuba will fit. I'd leave it alone if I were you. TIeven if you find one that will fit over the tang, it is likely to be too thick or thin. The spacers/sepa may or may not solve this. Swords and repairs are best left to someone that is highly experienced in them. If you start messing around with your katana, you are likes to be sorry you ever started messing with it. I have told several people this. Some listen. Some don't. The ones that didn't listen are wishing they did.<br>  <br>  *********<br>  EDIT:  Do not buy the Tsuba you posted a link to. Several reasons. I have done a lot (over 650) transactions on ebay. I can tell you that you do not want to ever buy from a seller in China that sells swords. They are rip of artists..... The swords and sword parts are not real. The make imitations that are cheap. Then you may not even receive it if you buy it. Lastly the hole looks wrong. It is likely made for a wakizashi or short sword. Stay away from ebay swords unless you know exactly what you are doing.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	That will not fit a katana... it is only 6.9cm across (2.25 inches!). Most likely it is intended for a tanto.<br>  Many quality tsuba have malleable copper shim pieces in the tsuka ana to ensure a good fit. If you want a good quality one - try Fred Lohmans in Portland... www.japanese-swords.com<br>  You should talk to your instructor about this modification. What sword do you have?|`|UxU7qZGTaa	Guards are not interchangeable.  It is very difficult to find an exact match unless it's from the same manufacturer.<br>  <br>  If you have gorilla glue and some handle wrap you can adjust to fit the relative size of your guard.|`|fklUAyJ0aa	put it in and see if it fits ask you wife if that dont work|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Guard? You mean the tsuba?<br>  <br>  Measure your sword right below the habaki, try to find a tsuba that's as close to these measurements as possible (or barely above). The habaki, seppa, and tsuka will hold it in place. If it's a little loose, just put more seppa on it. If it's really loose, take it or send it to a sword smith and have him fit it. Best thing would be to either get an aftermarket tsuba from place you got your sword, or better yet, don't mess with it at all.

But it's not big in the U.S. unfortunately.  It's a shame.  Too bad the American baseball fans for some reason believe that a World Series championship is a bigger accomplishment than winning a Gold Medal in an international competition.  If I had to choose between team USA winning the WBC or my LA Dodgers winning the World Series, I'd choose team USA winning the WBC in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is right...winning a Gold Medal is a bigger accomplishment than winning a regular league championship.  Why?  Because you're representing your country on an international stage rather than just your region on a national stage.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	MLB is not interested in the event.

What is the top speed?  Does it fold up?  Is it sturdy and well built?   <br>  <br>  I could go on, but I think the point is made. It's like asking asking what's a reasonable cost for a used car, house or even television, and in all cases, it varies greatly depending on what you are getting.<br>  <br>  I do sales and repair of treadmills in my spare time and I have acquired  working treadmills for free and I've sold used treadmills for as much as 3000 dollars(it was a very nice treadmill).<br>  <br>  I can give you a great answer if you give me a detailed question.

Q1MI6L96aa	If the character is brought into the company, then the wrestler should own it. If the concept was developed by creative, then the company has all the rights. This is just fair to how the idea was designed.|`|AA11482019	Don't forget WWE changing the names of former TNA stars when they came to WWE.  Monte Brown became Marcus Cor Von.   Chris Harris became Braden Walker.  Ron Killings became R-Truth.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Wrestling Promotions have owned the names and likenesses of characters for decades, this is nothing new. Unless you wrestle under the name you have always had and own the rights to that name. WWE for example own the rights to the name Stone Cold Steve Austin, they may in fact own the rights to the names "Stunning Steve Austin", the Hollywood Blonds and the Ringmaster, whcih Steve Williiams aka Steve Austin partiipated in.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	It's Like John Cena said on Howard Stern - "The Company (Vince) gave Me this Break ,and So I have No Problem with Him Owning My Name , and getting a Cut of the Profit I Produce."<br>  <br>  Without the Company , A Lot of these Guys Wouldn't Have Jobs in the First Place. So They Should be Thankful Just for that. Having Your Name be Owned & Copyrighted by a Wrestling Promotion Should be the Least of these Performers Worries...<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* - Added: If These Guys are So Worried or Mad about Their Names being Owned , They Can go and Get Their Names Copyrighted Themselves. They Can Own the Rights to Their OWN Name. That Would Legally Overthrow the Jurisdiction WWE , TNA , ROH , etc... has in the First Place When it Comes to Naming Rights.<br>  Example - If Cena Didn't Want his name to be Copyrighted & Owned by WWE , He Could've Legally gotten the Rights & Copyrighted His Own Name BEFORE Entering WWE, He Would then have Owned His Own Name. WWE Would've Had No Legal Way to do Anything about it. But Once You Sign on that Dotted line for a Promotion - They Own Everything about You , Including Your Name.|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Well, it doesnt really matter to me.  I mean WE know who the person really is.|`|qbEeecndaa	i don't care|`|vuyrIfiuaa	You can understand from a business view, but from a fans perspective it is not good. For example, WWE are reluctant to let wrestlers use the names that they were known for before they went to WWE and most of the time it leads to an unsucessful gimmick transformation.|`|GlOBQ24maa	idk what the hell u talkin about but i like watchin it cuz of muscle =] peace out homie|`|AA10825405	Makes sense.  A federation could spend millions developing, promoting, and making someone a superstar.  So they are just protecting their interest from that guy then going off on his own and basically using the federation's monetary investment for his own gains.  A guy like Mick Foley was smart to start using his own name instead of staying with Cactus Jack/Mankind/Dude Love because obviously the WWE doesn't own the name "Mick Foley".  Now granted, with the internet and 24/7 TV cycles we have these days, it is a lot easier for someone to sell himself based on his accomplishments without having to use the same gimick/name that he is best known for.  Obviously, everybody knows who Team 3D is without them having to use the Dudley Boys name.  But it would help them connect with the more casual fan if they could use the Dudley Boys name, which I guess is what the WWE is trying to prevent.  They don't want those casual fans to be casual TNA fans instead of casual WWE fans because they recognize the Dudley Boys name.
IMu3wBu8aa	He isn't being used the right way.<br>  He is sooo full of talent and they aren't doing anything about it. <br>  I think the WWE better wake up and give him more chances to shine.<br>  He should drop his current gimmick and they should give Shelton and Charlie another shot at being a Tag Team. They were one of those "old school" type of tag team. They had great chemistry and put on amazing matches. Could you imagine the 5 star matches they could put on with Miz and Morrison! They should really give them both that shot again. They would make Smackdown so much better.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Ya he is underrated ofcoousre. Instead of using him to imporsonate other wrestler wwe cud have used him to have a gud quality time feud with William Regal, rey mesterio, Mike Knox, C M Punk and that wud make him to show his true wrestling abilities to the world and we can judge if he is gud enough to elevate up in the order./|`|AkpPTYN2aa	underated.<br>  Brilliant technical wrestler.<br>  needs a good gimmick and a push.<br>  Just like Benjamin.<br>  Benjamin is pure awesome.<br>  Haas has the same potential.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I like his impersonation gimmick.

aIhVHfMUaa	Well Sri Lanka believed it when they were told they would be safe. Unfortunately it proved to be otherwise, its very sad to say it, but i think it will be many many years before International cricket will again be played in Pakistan, hopefully there first class cricket will continue and they will still be a team of international standard cos the last thing we want is for them to turn into another Zimbabwe!<br>  <br>  as for the article, Chris really is not a happy boy! and you cant blame him either, they were assured security and while is was provided, it was not adequate. its not a nice thing to say considering that people died trying to protect the team, but the truth of the matter is that they didnt have enough security to deter the attackers or to provide enough protection that would ensure the players safety<br>  <br>  as i said, its very sad to say it, but it will be many many years before international cricket returns to Pakistan|`|sjWBmBTCaa	Australia was promised if they toured Pakistan, the security they would be given would be equal to that of a head of state. If this is the way Pakistan takes care of it's visiting head's of state, it's a good thing that we did not tour.<br>  <br>  Two Australian umpires were there, (as well as an English umpire) This did not happen. Chris Broad said they were promised security and wanted to know where it was. Is this too much to ask for.|`|4VoQduaZaa	Even I read Broad's and Murali's reports about lack of security. And they are not sure if it just negligence or something beyond that. <br>  At the same time, we have also heard of six security pesonnel laying their lives to save the team. I am not sure which version is to be believed.<br>  <br>  The attacks can happen anywhere anytime. But once you promise the safety of your guests, the least you can do is to take utmost care that nothing goes wrong from your side. You may fail, but not trying to protect is criminal.|`|hTruYNUQaa	The Aussies have made the right decisions over the last decade not to tour Pakistan.<br>  <br>  They cant be believed or trusted,the security was appalling.<br>  Pakistan may have hosted there last international game for a very long time.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	After sometime you people get to know who is pakistan.....<br>  just wait and see these terrorists.<br>  ranatunga was said before the tour that we have to help our neighbour(pakistan).now where is ranatunga?<br>  don't help if you have neighbour like pakistan.|`|OEe5eOSIaa	No ,Never again.Now there is no safety for any cricket team.|`|8yMkjeDdaa	nope i believed in Pakistan but not anymore|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	I remember the NZ team in the 1990's and they left Pakistan and in 2002, when a bomb was set off near their hotel.  <br>  <br>  I guess touring Pakistan is a thing of the past|`|Leoc8rlGaa	I might have guessed you would be popping the champagne corks and saying "I told you so". <br>  <br>  But this particular attack was unprecedented; the only similar event was the Mumbai attacks. It is not like the bomb blasts that have been going off sporadically. Yes, the security may have been poor on the coach convoy. But the main concern had been about an attack at the stadium, or at the hotel, or a roadside bomb blast. Getting attacked with machine guns and rocket launchers wasn't something anybody had envisaged.<br>  <br>  Still, it is Pakistan, which sadly is becoming increasingly lawless. And it appears Westerners are not the only targets. Anyone will do in this senseless nightmare.<br>  <br>  I don't think this is a time to be scoring cheap points, and making crude jibes. Most Pakistani people are fine, we should not condemn an entire nation because of a few maniacs. Guess you will though.|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	Not until the Pakistani government actually does something about these terrorist bastards. Hopefully the vast majority of honest Pakistani people might pressure the government to actually do something after being deprived of top level cricket because no one wants to tour there.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the earth becomes my throne<br>  I adapt to the unknown<br>  Under wandering stars I've grown<br>  By myself but not alone<br>  I ask no one<br>  <br>  ...And my ties are severed clean<br>  The less I have, the more I gain<br>  Off the beaten path I reign<br>  Rover, wanderer<br>  Nomad, vagabond<br>  Call me what you will<br>  <br>  <br>  But I'll take my time anywhere<br>  I'm free to speak my mind anywhere<br>  And I'll never mind anywhere<br>  <br>  Anywhere I roam<br>  Where I lay my head is home<br>  <br>  But I'll take my time anywhere<br>  I'm free to speak my mind<br>  And I'll take my find anywhere<br>  <br>  Anywhere I roam<br>  Where I lay my head is home<br>  <br>  Carved upon my stone<br>  My body lie, but still I roam<br>  Wherever I may roam<br>  Wherever I may roam<br>  Wherever I may roam|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	Nope, there was reason for Aus and India to decline the tours to Pakistan but now there will never be test cricket or any form of international cricket in Pakistan for a long long time|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	No way, we cannot play with people's life.
9W6TRPQVaa	The balance of the team will be stuffed but I think that the bigger question is why are they getting injured all the time?  Do we need to look at our current training methods?  There is not much point in picking players if they can only play every other test match.  How are they going to  make it through an Ashes Tour?|`|aIhVHfMUaa	Well truth be told, i dont think that its so bad about Hilfy, but Siddle i think would be a big loss at the moment, he has just got better and better the more Test cricket he's played, constantly improving, but both of the being out would be very bad news!! even worse that Bollinger is under a cloud as well!!<br>  <br>  having said that tho, Geeves and Maggoffin are both very good and capable of suceeding at the highest level and Johnson has already proved that he can lead an inexperienced attack<br>  <br>  you have to feel for Bracken tho, whats the guy gotta do to get another test!|`|KbzXg3hfaa	Well Australia is going through cricketers like no body's business!<br>  <br>  I really hope Siddle in particular pulls through - his aggression is fun to watch and quite inspiring to the rest of the bowlers IMHO. Also wonderboy Johnson will be under too much pressure if neither of the other 2 plays.<br>  <br>  But I am still an optimist and hope we uncover yet even more talent :)|`|sjWBmBTCaa	Ducks and Drakes, i hope.|`|Leoc8rlGaa	I'm sure bottom of the Sheffield Shield New South Wales will be able to supply some replacements. Perhaps the wonder kid Phil Hughes could turn his arm over.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	Hopefully they'll be right, it will affect the team hugely if they don't play as they get crucial wickets at crucial times.

I got to meet Gretzky and his dad last year, when they lost to Detroit, right after the all-star break. Wayne looked like a beaten man.

Although it is sad to see some players go, its great to see some of those names on our roster. <br>  Hopefull the situation in net does improve from the Tellqvist situation, which it probably will. <br>  <br>  and out of Carcillo, Fedoruk, and McGrattan, out of all three I think Carcillo will DEFINATELY be the one to stay in Phoenix/Glendale, because he has one of the top 3 largest fan bases on the team, and he usually gives every game a highlight. McGrattan is worthless becuase the guy had to go to rehab, and Carcillo tops Fedoruks points by.. a lot? <br>  lol, <br>  <br>  but overall I am TOTALLY, 100% happy with the trades made.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	Phoenix should have a help wanted sign out front for a letter stitcher. They scored in the draft department as well with a first and second this year and a fourth round pick next year. Phoenix looks to be the biggest winner this year. Calgary and Boston seem to have come out pretty well too. Rangers did well with Morris but not sure where Antropov fits in.|`|795nSfFiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Is it possible that the Coyotes got a little bit extra for Morris because of the Rangers needing to clear a little room for everyone?<br>  Yes, I do think they did very well though. I thought they got a little less for Tellqvist then I expected, but that happens<br>  <br>  Thank you|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	I hope you're right!<br>  <br>  However.. Derek Morris said that he loves Arizona and hopes deal can be worked in the off season<br>  <br>  I spoke with him personally at the autograph session and wishes to retire a Coyote.|`|2PlJEJzQaa	yeah Pheonix definitly used there big names to secure their future they have the depth now but expect during the offseason that Pheonix goes for a couple big names...bringing in 2 stars would make this team a Cup contender|`|QSShHlRiaa	They made off a hella of alot<br>  better off then ALOT of the other teams.|`|GUulmGm7aa	I seriously hope Phoenix is ready to compete for the play-offs soon. I'd love to see Shane Doan win a Stanley Cup.|`|jpS9wgu8aa	I was pissed to hear both Prucha and Dawes were traded from the rangers for Morris. I would have been able to live with one of them being traded but not both.<br>  <br>  But i agree with you. Coyotes did make out pretty well.|`|e49b4189bca799c5d0de587ffcd3c7a7aa	It was a great day for the Coyotes in my book.  Especially love the addition of Prucha.  This guy can play, and will be huge with the minutes in Phoenix.  Good day for them.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	yes they did quite well :)|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I don't know......none of those players are going to make them contenders any time soon. We'll see how the draft picks turn out I suppose.<br>  <br>   All in the eye of the beholder I guess......their dressing room cancer also happens to be by far their top center. Derek Morris........as you said, he wanted out anyways and it was more a case of B for NY, they needed to shed salary and Carcillo is a rare combination of enforcer who can play a regular shift and chip in with a goal.<br>  <br>   In return, they get more guys with reasonable salaries to get them through trying times.<br>  <br>   One has to think they are getting near that salary floor (once they make room for these guys).|`|nQlwiHfLaa	It's all about don Maloney. LOL<br>  <br>  Outstanding strategy and execution given the team's current state, on and off the ice.<br>  <br>  The 'Yotes got better, faster, younger and less expensive. I agree that Prucha can be an offensive contributor and also believe Dawes can develop into a solid, top-six forward. As a Ranger fan, it was tough to see him go. On the other hand, if the team moves back to Winnipeg, Dawes can play in his hometown. hehe<br>  <br>  Now, I'm just waiting to see if Morris in a Ranger jersey looks like Morris, circa 2000 or will he end up resembling a right handed Redden. I won't even comment on Antropov...|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I can't believe the talent the Coyotes picked up (along with the picks).<br>  <br>  I've never understood the Jokinen fascination on any level.<br>  <br>  Phoenix didn't give up any of their young studs, and I like Lombardi.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	The only problem that the Coyotes have now is being located in the city of Phoenix. Winnipeg would of loved it.|`|lYnkvRASaa	They did well and how did they get that much for Derek Morris?<br>  <br>  We may look back and say they were the biggest winner on this day in 2-3 yrs.<br>  <br>  Edit, after picking up Antropov and Avery I was thinking that roster is getting crowded.  Could be a good trade for both.  That Redden deal is going to hurt the NYR for a long time.<br>  <br>  Edit: There is a distinguished gentleman wandering around in the lobby of our building wearing a Hawks jersey and a fedora, Is that you?
Y4mz8BShaa	They're both good choices, but that UHC is pretty much indestructible, unless you take a knife, hammer, saw , or automobile to it. In terms of reliability and durability, it's one of the best spring rifles on the market. The accuracy is good enough for what it is, and the FPS is quite good for a spring rifle. If you're looking for accuracy, go with the UTG. If you want to be able to abuse your rifle, the UHC.|`|fTXpVgRRaa	between the two, the uhc<br>  It happens to be way more acurate, and will probably last longer. Also, UTG is a rebrander, they buy other comapnie's products, and sell them for an inflated price.<br>  However, in my opinion, i would suggest a sawed off spring shotgun, I have one from Cybergun and it has lasted me two years. It shoots as well as the day I first got it.

8cPPLSDOaa	Tim Duncan all the way.<br>  <br>  Kobe is a horrible teammate. He tosses them under the bus frequently. Latest is Sun about a week or two ago|`|OJGHWczaaa	kobe! i mean in 04 they missed the playoffs then the next 3 years were taken out of the playoffs by the suns. now look at them we made it to the finals and now have the best record in the nba.<br>  <br>  tim is good but i think his team is just too old. but they still have the 2nd best record in the west so they must be doing something right.|`|S7rc6mp7aa	Timmy is, on and off court. He will accept his role anywhere on the team. Even if he were to come off the bench. I don't see that with Kobe. He will do whatever is best for the team even a pay cut again, to win another ring. I don't see that with Kobe either.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	Kobe is a ballhog but a great player.<br>  Tim Duncan LEADS his team to winning,he doesn't never pass the ball and shoot ALL THE TIME!!!<br>  So i would say Tim Duncan|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Tim he teaches his team better as a veteran and kobe just cheats who want's to learn fron that.|`|ONrFDcUTaa	timmy|`|4JqnRY56aa	Without Kobe Lakers cant win, Spurs could win with out Timmy|`|HuQVHaIgaa	tim|`|xMJXJPrDaa	Tim Duncan (Im a Kobe Fan btw)|`|KdhNCnEjaa	This has to be Tim Duncan.

Kobe wasn't the leader of his team until Shaq left, and no championships since then. Tim Duncan has always been the leader of his team, and he has three.

v77SnunOaa	Yo wait for it then you hit your open man. Do that a couple of times, bait them. Then the next time have your guards get you the ball faster and beat the double team with a power move! MAKE YOUR FREE THROWS!|`|kYBlgFQAaa	You need to take a quick shot or strong move to the hoop.  Keep the ball high and limit your dribble (1 power dribble at most) before they have time to double down on you.  Or, probably the wiser option, you need to find the guy they are leaving open by double teaming.  Somebody is going to have a wide open shot or path to the hoop.  If they are going to collapse on you, then you need to make them pay for it.  You need to trust your teammates.<br>  <br>  Also, you can always pass the ball back out and repost closer to the hoop.  If one of the defenders leaves you, it might give you an easier look at the basket.|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	I think the best way is after you draw the double or triple team wait for the player to leave you teammates unguarded and pass the ball. As soon as your teammates start making shots they will have to take away the double team or else.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	If you are in a double team wait as soon as the player leaves the player he is guarding so then pass the ball quick to the guy.|`|T5BshhZWaa	pass the ball to an open teammate

wKnjGSU1aa	In my own opinion, there's never been a doubt that the FMF is far ahead of the MLS. The Superliga isn't worth anything, it's a pre-season tournament that gives nothing more than a Million Dollars, other than that, what does it give? Nothing. The Champions League is another thing, you become Champion of CONCACAF, it gives you a good amount of money, it's giving you bragging rights, and the most important thing, it gives you the ticket to the Club World Cup, that's something to fight for, that's something that's woth it. The players, we know the FMF has way more quality. The thing I find funny is that some MLS fans think the league is getting better by getting players coming to U.S. for their last big paycheck and relaxing, that ain't bringing anything to the league besides making them stars. Those players don't have much to give. On the other hand, you have players like Caba?as, Suazo , "Chaco" Jimenez, Damian Alvarez, Guillermo Ochoa, Omar Arellano, Danilinho and Neri Cardozo who come from very good clubs and at a very good age. There is just no comparison, they will say these things to try to make believers, or better yet, they say it so much to convince themselves that what they are saying is truth to them, I ain't buying anything. Look at the CCL trophies, 24 for Mexico, 6 for Costa Rica, 2 for United States, where's the comparison, and take note that I am also counting the NASL, which still counts, even if people don't want to take the NASL in mind since it didn't work out. Where is the comparison? It's not there. I hope the MLS grows, but the fans have to keep their feet on the ground and not just jump to conclusion thinking that by winning a good for nothing trophie called Superliga, they are automatically on the level of the FMF. It's not all of the MLS fans, but there is a certain part of them who think this. That's my opinion. Look at the Copa Libertadores also, who is constantly in Semi-Finals or Finals? Who's doing Haza?as in South America? Look at this answer I gave to another question, it's real long, but it's thorough on how I explain it.|`|7Xridrxaaa	the MLS isnt even an ounce as good as the Mexican league. The CONCACAF proved it. THe MLS cant used teh excuse we use about having our teams in the middle of pre season cause at the end Dynamo was the only team standing. All Mexican teams made it to the quarters and only one MLS team. Not to mention they played central american opposition. So does that mean we can say Central American teams are better than MLS teams? haha truth is the MLS is a crap league and is a long way from being that amazing league everybody dreams of that supposedly is going to be one of the best in the world haha.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	We are superior dude...|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Is it safe to say?! its always been safe to say...The national team is another story, they at the same level, but the MLS is no where near the FMF thats a fact. The superliga dosent mean anything, its just another money making tourney....Atlante is playing pretty crappy in the liga, but they kill dynamo.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	you mean ppl argue this?<br>  5 years ago ppl never talked about the mls<br>  now its somewhat mentioned and grabbing attention by any reasons<br>  5 years from now they will be competitive<br>  10 years from now they will be consistent<br>  i know mls was never at the level of the fmf <br>  its obvious<br>  but what says mls wont continue to improve just like ussoccer|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Si senor !|`|8zgFyfibaa	Its always been safe to say FMF will always dominate the retirement league (mls). Maybe you say this because mls lovers always report us because we offend they're crappy league.<br>  <br>  I heard in a tv show that since some european players are close to retiring the mls is trying to get them. These are the players they're trying to get.<br>  <br>  Luis figo-inter milan<br>  Thierry henry-barcelona<br>  Pavel nedved-juventus<br>  Raul-real madrid.<br>  <br>  Maybe some of them might come because we all know the mls will spend hundred of millions of dollars and come on they will rarely play and still get payed more than they do in europe.<br>  <br>  And mls fans bragg that they can bring big name players to they're league,its funny because FMF teams aren't stupid to waste so much money on semi-retirement players.<br>  <br>  Yesterday atlante showed that mls teams can't compete in international cups. <br>  <br>  Just stick to you're superliga and mls cup. Mls fans you'l never be a contender league.|`|g4ukAIecaa	mls will never be better than fmf simple as that and now im happy that there is no more mls teams in the concacaf champions league|`|o2kW3eG0aa	hey man dont 4get about those Caribbean teams that beat the hell out of them in the USA.. haha so yeah its very safe b4 this Competition started.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	MLS will never be better because it is not nearly as old and lacks talent they are a crappy league|`|qbPbvLuLaa	YES|`|zPCfcDXNaa	safe!|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	yezzir<br>  <br>  all i gotta say is MLS sucks and FMF is da best|`|XvjXrCffaa	Dam fcking eazy<br>  ur ill<br>  i read everything u wrote<br>  ur hella smart foo|`|D6RSJ1BNaa	Absolutely, 100%, without a doubt the MFF pwns that **** US league.  **** the USA.  They are ****<br>  <br>  The SuperLeague is a meaningless tournament that means nothing.  The winner of that goes nowhere.  The CONCAchampions league matters because the winner goes to the Club World Cup.<br>  <br>  I think all Mexican fans should fight the American fans.  That'd be sweet|`|yS9DjJvnaa	even though i agree that the FMF is better than the MLS...<br>  <br>  we all used the "its pre-season" excuse in the superliga..<br>  <br>  BUT NOW the mls fan's can say the same... its better to see yhem play when both teams have rithm and then we can truly say how much better the FMF is..|`|Kq46gkHUaa	cant wait until dynamo187 comes bak her<br>  i think that they just want to sound like a good league<br>  by talking smack and never face  the fact that we are the most succesful league in the concacaf and will always be like that|`|eWadjRfpaa	All those people that say Mls is better are retards.<br>  Even out weakest team.(Chivas)can give a better game than their best team.|`|9KbU8jPRaa	if you use as evidence what happen yesterday yes you can|`|jUeiFZfmaa	Yeah that was never in doubt mls has always been a weak league.

It always has been.|`|85d551f3c68ac59219602c4c09024961aa	MLS can slob on my nob like corn on the cob|`|kwMOUjiNaa	People claiming USL better than MLS. i mean really? The last time a USL team won the U.S. Open Cup was 1999...and most MLS teams don't even care about that cup, and they field their B teams. Anyway, back to the question, yes the Mexican League is clearly better, however I feel many FMF supporters are too proudful to recognize any other teams in concacaf to be actually good. Atlante was the better team when they played Houston, but keep in mind that Houston is NOT one of the best teams in MLS right now, like many have claimed. They are a mediocre team at best.  They have lost their best player and playmaker Dwayne Derosario, lost a great striker in Nate Jaqua since the time they qualified for the tournament, and when they played Atlante, BOTH starting center backs were out for injury so they were starting a very weak line-up. Im not even going to go into the preseason business... teams should be ready to play and be prepared regardless of what time of year. So to answer the question, yes FMF is better... clearly better even, and not just because of this tournament (anyone basing their claims on one tournament isn't thinking right), their teams have consistantly fared better in international competition throughout the years, but anyone that says that MLS is a terrible league is obviously delusional, or has a superiority complex, and will not accept change. every league sucked at one point.

It's easier for McDaniels to have a QB like Cassel who already knows his offense than to teach Cutler the offense from scratch.

The team said the conversation between Cutler and McDaniels will take place once the quarterback returns to Denver from Nashville, Tenn.Cutler is upset that he was the subject of trade talks for Matt Cassel, who eventually was dealt from the New England Patriots to the Kansas City Chiefs, and has suggested that his relationship with first-year coach McDaniels has become tense.<br>  <br>  Cutler was angered during the weekend when his name came up in talks involving a three-way trade that would have sent him to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and landed Cassel in Denver.<br>  <br>  McDaniels was the offensive coordinator last year in New England, where he tutored Cassel, a career backup who led the Patriots to an 11-5 season after Tom Brady was injured during the season opener.<br>  <br>  Cutler, who is preparing to learn the intricate New England-style offense after working in the West Coast system during his first three NFL seasons, was miffed that McDaniels even entertained the notion of dealing him to another team. Cutler also said he believed he still would be traded.<br>  <br>  Cutler, who has three years left on the six-year deal that he signed with the Broncos as a rookie, set numerous team records last season, including single-season passing yards (4,526), completions (384) and 300-yard games (eight).However, Cutler and the Broncos squandered a three-game AFC West lead with three games to go, missing out on the playoffs for a third consecutive season and costing former coach Mike Shanahan his job after 14 seasons in Denver.<br>  <br>  Cutler is 17-20 with no playoff appearances since replacing Jake Plummer as the Broncos' starting quarterback late in the 2006 season.<br>  <br>  McDaniels, 32, was hired as the new coach in January, and the Broncos promoted Brian Xanders, 37, to general manager last month. Both of them report directly to team owner Pat Bowlen, who hasn't publicly addressed the rift between his new coach and his temperamental quarterback.|`|YKhulh5Haa	Your absolutely right.

Parent is not a "great" anything.  He is a young, talented defenseman who is still developing.  The Flyers are no longer looking at 2-3 years down the road, they feel they have a legitimate shot at making a cup run.  That typically means that the younger players hit the minors.<br>  <br>  I think the only thing that keeps McLaren off the Flyers roster at this point is the salary cap.|`|A9cE0Niaaa	I don't think we needed him if we wanted to get a big defensemen y not pronger or boumeester why would we get someone who hasn't even played in the nhl at all this season....plus we have a lot of defensemen.

I suppose I would go with Niittymaki just by a hair because he seems better at controlling rebounds. (Biron gives up some juicy ones.) I think he (Niittymaki) should stay closer to the pipes when trying to cut down angles. I had the philosophy that some of the best angle-cutting moves are the ones you don't make. But then again I never did make it to the bigs.|`|AA12089021	I believe Nittimaki is most comfortable and plays better in the role he is currently in.  He gets a respectable amount of playing time and when he does see time he plays well.  Outside of the Calder Cup season with the Phantoms in 2005, he has not been successful when carrying the work load for any team he has ever played for including his time in Finland.  His two worst seasons statistically in the NHL were the two in which he played in more than half the games on the schedule.<br>  <br>  I think he is and should be one of the top backup goaltenders in the league.|`|93e1ff606f85ccabe51449c8266f3ce2aa	I agree.<br>  <br>  Nittymaki is our dark hero. Naturally I'm not certain about that but I think he's about to lift a lot of eyebrows.
y7jE63ULaa	As much as i LOVE to be at the race in person it is much easier to follow it when i'm watching it on tv.  For me its my surroundings. At home its much quieter and i don't have a lot of distractions like i do at the race.  When i go to the races here in California i always rent the scanners so i can listen to my driver and know at all times whats going on with him and his car.<br>  <br>  Go Jeff Burton!!!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	On TV but you have to have two channel coverage to cover the advert gaps. Had to do that for years with F1 coverage.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	It's easier to keep track of positions on TV.<br>  They have that little stream that goes across the bottom of the screen, so it's easier to know who's where and who's a lap down and who's two laps, etc..etc..I still don't know what happened to Tony Stewart at the Vegas race, by the time we got to his radio communications it was dead silence.<br>  Had I have been watching on TV, they would've told me how he ended up finishing so poorly.<br>  Watching it live is funner though..|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	thnx for the warning on the radio<br>  yes it is easier to follow on tv<br>  has yet to go to a race.. and at the race they seem to miss because its hard to follow all the action and yes they do have monitors to watch|`|cMLJPQpBaa	It's best to follow it at the trac.<br>     It's like having ''Crank it up'' for the whole race... You can bring a radio and scanners to keep up with the info. bro.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	As they say in the music business, between listening to a C.D. on your stereo or going to a live concert...<br>  "It's a whole different animal"|`|2kg7nWX5aa	It  is easier to follow a race on T.V. ,then watching it when your there at that race track. When your there at the  race track you have to follow all the cars really closely and follow your favorite driver closely and count what  place their in. You have to pay a lot of attention. And if your race has like no cautions , it can get very boring. I know my mom and I get very tired if there is no cautions  because your watching the cars go around and around ,it is kind of hypnotizing .At least when I'm watching  T.V. I can pause it because I have a DVR and I can record it and go do what ever I want to do, I don't have to just sit and watch it. When I have it recorded when I'm watching it I can skip all the boring parts, like interviews and parts with no cautions or parts when the reports are just talking, plus I can go back if I missed something  that I wanted to see. it's nice.|`|PRg9UgOlaa	I think it is easier for me to follow the race on tv, just because you can always tell what position the drivers are in and my couch is a million times more comfy than a metal bench shared by 50 people. They do instant replays in case you missed something (wrecks, bad pits, ect..) At the track, once cars start getting lapped it is hard to tell what position they are in even with the "position tower". I do really enjoy watching the race at home and at the track. There is no party more fun than a NASCAR party!|`|GCOrku95aa	I find it very easy to follow the action both live and on TV. Of course, the only races I've been to live were at Dover and Pocono. And Pocoo was a lot easier to follow my driver than I thought it would be, I bought great seats, the only part of the track I could not see was going into turn 1, and both Mark and Carl were pitting directly in front of me and right next to each other, so that was cool. My dad was amazed that I could see Mark's car across the track, but I knew Jeff Burton's bright orange car was in front of Mark, so if I could find Jeff, I could find Mark.|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	are you high? the guys at MRN are the only one's who DO know what's going on on the track. they have kind of a zone coverage. they have several announcers and each one of them is responsible for covering a different 'zone' of the track, and they transition from one announcer to the other very smoothly. that way, they don't miss anything|`|p8JfOlTzaa	I've done both in the last several years.  What it comes down to is if you have great seats at a race it's better hence making it more exciting.  Your seat sucks and you can only see half the track and one turn, better to stay at home.  You still have the pole in the in-field, but sometimes that still gets confusing.|`|nxvCmRbwaa	I think it is easier to follow on TV. I have been to Bristol a couple of times. It's fun, I would go again in a heart beat. But on the TV you have the announcer to listen to.|`|ndX4Je5Oaa	i prefer in person because you watch the action all over the track|`|qwvijKexaa	it's easier to follow a race, forget t.v|`|De4FTht6aa	TV. I went to Infineon last year and I could barely see the action, or any wrecks. On TV, You can follow all the things that are happening during the<br>  race. On TV, You can also see the point standings immediately after the race ends. I don't know, maybe you can see things better on tracks that are not road courses. Please pick me as best answer.|`|62a47bc66e6cc30890b5382949fbccf4aa	on TV!! For sure! I have been to one race and I swear I will never go to another one. You can't follow what is going on at the track, the drunks and out of hand partiers in the stands make it impossible!! People puking all over the place!!|`|cpeA9fdwaa	Hey, Go to Montreal, Canada.

XwQxKwRcaa	I couldn't agree more. Anyone who knows boxing knows that there was nothing lucky about that punch. <br>  <br>  I remember when I was watching that fight thinking that Foreman was setting him up the whole time. The only question I had was whether or not Foreman would run out of time. I wasn't sure about that part of it. <br>  <br>  But, as you stated, Foreman was shooting the one-two over and over, with differing speed and power. <br>  <br>  You also noticed that Moorer was badly hurt by jab cross just before the big homerun punch. Moorer has since stated that he was basically out on his feet after that first right hand. He was a sitting duck. <br>  <br>  Moorer-Foreman was a very underrated fight. Moorer actually was doing one hell of a job, but didn't take Foreman seriously. He actually should have taken the Tommy Morrison approach late in the fight and just survive, he certainly had a significant points lead.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Agreeing with everyone else here so far.<br>  It may have been said by those who wanted Moore to win and/or those who thought that Foremen should never have left the Pulpit, that he got lucky and landed a desperate punch!<br>  You just can't please everybody!|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	forman was has one of the best ko percentages in boxing history so koing moorer was no lucky punch|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	Anything that you attempt to do regardless of the reason or the chance of it actually being done is not luck. if i throw a shot at a guy with my eyes close and the chances of that happening is 1 out of 99, then if i hit and KO the guy then that was my 1%.  there is no luck.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	As questions go, this one was so good, it answered itself.  I agree, Big George was not only one of boxing's heaviest punchers, he knew what he was doing from the start of that one and set Moorer up, great strategy from a great fighter.|`|Eg4K2zP1aa	the truth of the fight is michael moorer did not heed the warning of teddy atlas which was to maintain lateral movement, but instead chose to become a stationary target.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	lucky or not this is the facts moorer had a glass chin|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	It was a desperation shot, but it was the furthest thing from lucky.  George was well behind on the scorecards and getting smacked around.  Moorer was using movement to keep away from George's right.  In the 10th, George briefly stunned Moorer with a hook.  And George, being George, knew immediately that this was his only chance.  Foreman began winging desperation hooks, missing badly with most, but connected again, which stunned Moorer again.  Moorer finally abandoned counter-clockwise movement and went clockwise to get away from the desperate hooks.  But it put him right into range for Foreman's right.  What happened next was one of the most clever combos in boxing history.  George threw a light 1-2, Moorer didn't get hurt so he stayed in there, then George repeated the combo, but put everything he had on the 2, and landed the kill shot.<br>  <br>  The kill shot was the furthest thing from a lucky punch but the hooks earlier in the round were flailing desperation punches that lead to the end.|`|b3e474d5e2b22c03370fe229c6f87ec1aa	In no way was Foreman's punch "luck". If anything, it was predictable. Moorer was constantly reminded by Atlas not to stand and trade with a ferocious puncher like Foreman - but did he listen? Nope. He played right into Foreman's hands and Foreman, being the vastly experienced pro that he was, knocked him out, just like Atlas said he would if he got careless. <br>  <br>  Thing is, much like Foreman after he lost to Ali, Moorer is still very, very bitter about this loss.|`|dh48AkbCaa	what about all the other come-from-behind kayo's throughout the sport? marciano, chavez, chiquita gonzales, lamotta?<br>  <br>  having said that, foreman was always dangerous, and teddy atlas knew it, and kept telling moorer not to get careless.<br>  <br>  lucky? no, blessed? yes.|`|kBScgrVMaa	I don't believe Foreman threw a "lucky, desperation" punch, I just think, Moorer was knackered and couldn't take anymore of Foreman's bombs landing on him anymore. <br>  <br>  During the fight, Moorer was dancing, taunting and landing shots at will, but, during the later rounds, the former light heavyweight was feeling the pace of having the 18st+ heavyweight George Foreman close the ring off. <br>  <br>  When that great right hand landed and sent Moorer crashing to defeat, I was bouncing about like a madman, not only had Big George finally got back what Muhammad Ali had takren from him 20 years previous, but, he had also wiped out a big-headed misfit of boxing. <br>  <br>  I couldn't stand Michael Moorer, and had he given Lennox a shot, instead of George, he would have lost his titles 9 rounds sooner. <br>  <br>  During the 1990's, there were alot of different "champions", but, can anyone on this site name a "champion" that ever defended, or wanted to defend against Lennox Lewis? <br>  <br>  The 1990's American heavyweight champions were cowards, all of them. <br>  <br>  Lennox Lewis was the real Champion and eventually, the peoples champion, even George Foreman went on record and said he'd NEVER defend against Lewis. <br>  <br>  Every 1990's heavyweight was a pretender, especially Michael Moorer, taking the route of fighting Old George, only to be KO'd!|`|osPstl3jaa	I agree with Maurice. In that fight, Foreman feinted with his left jab and Moore moved to his left, right into a big right hand. Foreman smiled just before he threw the right hand, so it was set up by him perfectly.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	I agree 100%...You know your boxing!

LIKkt8djaa	Depends on the size of the kickers, But the 20footers and up generally you let the jump launch you off, If You try to ollie off of them you'll have a greater chance of throwing your balance off.|`|jTaW3goeaa	The problem with many people with the larger jumps that require you to clear large gaps is they get tentative and check their speed all the way up to the launch point, this does not give you anywhere close to enough speed which will cause you to land on the flat and hurt yourself.  You have to get enough speed to clear the gap, its hard because you think you're going way too fast but its just a fear you have to get over.  You have to get a feel for the snow and decide how much to speed check up to the ramp, you should give yourself plenty of time to build up enough speed to clear it.  On days when the snow is slower you will have to give yourself more time of being in a tuck up to the ramp but on faster days you may be able to speed check a little bit longer.|`|2lakZBgiaa	well for you i'd suggest as your gettin to the top, just give it a little jump up so you can get some air, and if your landing on the flat than obviously, you need more speed, you don't have to pop and ollie, just jump and try to stay steady in the air, always keep your knees bent and get ready for the landing.|`|0c2fv654aa	you need to pop off the lip of the jump. learn how to pop without going off balance. doing a method keeps me very balanced as opposed to waiving my arms around like a retard. if you dont pop, you wont get enough air off the jump. if u do pop, ud b suprised at how far u go and how much higher u go and how much better it looks. with the same speed, no pop clears me about 20-25 feet of a kicker. with a good pop i clear 30-35 feet of the kicker|`|qqt0GTW8aa	Sounds like you are checking your speed too much.<br>  Usually in the terrain parks in my area you only need speed, it is not necessary to jump.
fu1ArLwbaa	well i know that the girls have to wear it because it feels a lot more natural than playing with baggy shorts like I used to, and its a lot more comfortable, but i know for a guy it would be really awkward (sorry if that's not how u spell it) at first, but if everyone on the team is wearing spandex, then yeah, you should. also, if the coach says you have to, i would do that or you could get kicked off the team... :) hope i helped, and believe me, you will get used to the feeling :)|`|orWQYU70aa	haha ummm no they dont have to lol all the guys i have seen playing in swim shorts you don't have to wear them at all.... <br>  <br>  the only reason why girls wear them is because when way back in the day girls slid on the floor and their pants slid with them so they invented spandex....hehe<br>  <br>  most guys indoor and outdoor just wear swim trunks...:)|`|FwBCTJj8aa	i think it would be weird for them especially if they have had shorts the whole time.

ETkqlgqwaa	BoogeyMan vs Kane was interesting. Two freakish monsters that everyone ponders how they can be beaten. Obvious Kane would win, but interesting. <br>  6/10<br>  <br>  Santino vs Mark Henry<br>  It was funny how full of himself Santino is, and how he gets killed so fast, and how Beth and Rosa react.

She showed some great moves, and Natalya had some interesting power spots. Natalya had a great reversal in the end to win.<br>  8/10<br>  <br>  6 Man Tag Match:<br>  Very entertaining, as all the other 6 Man Tag's. Not much to say. I'd prefer Christian pinned by someone other then Swagger. I'm kind of tired of Dreamer though, he's a bit annoying and has gotten boring.<br>  8/10<br>  <br>  Overall: 7/10|`|97jqpA54aa	8<br>  the first match was interesting to see two monsters from different shows.<br>  the diva match was good cause I like it that ECW is adding a diva division again.<br>  third match was fine but the whole Santino think kinda threw me off cause everyone knew who would win. But i like the angle of Santino cause he makes me laugh<br>  last match I wasn't satisfied with the results. Partly because I am not a fan of Jack Swagger and The Miz and Morrison. <br>  overall I liked the fact that they brought RAW superstars to ECW|`|LuhTYk0Maa	they could have had finlay or tommy dreamer be pinned and not christian who is wwe's last chance to be any good.|`|6pFGfzQdaa	8. It was really interesting|`|srP47FC7aa	I'd give it an 8.5/10. It was a decent show which kept me interested in it.|`|XLHa9hiiaa	0 cuz i dont watch ecw ecw suckssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FNwxcBPpaa	4 ~ not very good and very predictable.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	8. <br>  <br>  There were no backstage segments, just wrestling straight through.<br>  <br>  I actually got to see Natalya in action (which I've been wanting for a while).<br>  <br>  The main event was great. I've been waiting for Christian and John Morrison to go head up<br>  <br>  And also, we got to see Santino, and that's always great
0rzGCvTHaa	No you run from belgians thats low . Everton zijn vuilnis you ****
Fz0UZpxraa	In general, the straighter you hit it, the further it will go.  So, the straightest driver by far is the G10.  Of course a good golf swing helps too.  Be that as it may, a product test done by Golf Digest or Golf Magazine shows the G10 being the straightest.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FWsv3Schaa	i have the taylormade burner and its a great club<br>  the shaft is a bit "whippier" if you could put it that way, which makes it go straighter|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Its the Indian, not the arrow!|`|kGuJmQzSaa	Hey, the new callaway FT's are AWESOME for solid contact and control. Go with a stiff graphite shaft for the best distance and straightness. If you're not a callaway fan I would check out cobra. There pro SX, which is great for distance and above average control were priced about 350 last year, but you can get it now for under 150.|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	to hit the ball long and straight, get some lessons. all the drivers are good, if you have good swing.|`|IXT67mbraa	a       drives pretty straight and long.. its gotta be a graphite shaft tho,|`|Qx4rRxijaa	Right now i have the Nike Sasquatch and it hits straight.But the club only does so much. It is your swing that perfects the shot. But if your looking to hit it straight and longer maybe try a lower lofted driver. it might help.|`|tB2NTG0aaa	the newest one's are probably either the FT-9 or the FT-IQ
Mvd0YfIPaa	nothing to it but to do it.  just go for it.  and don't think about it too much.  that is what used to freak me out.  :-)|`|2V87n4PKaa	you'll be fine.<br>  your coach will walk you through the steps on how to do it<br>  the very first time i tried to do one, i was on the tramp. i though we were supposed to do a dive roll, but we were supposed to do a back handspring. i was like ".......huh?"<br>  its not that scary as long as you have a spotter. just jump up and back, reach your arms up to the sky, and arch your back|`|m6EUv8zgaa	I was always scared too!<br>  I found it easier to do it from standing to get over the fear, but once I got used to it, I found it easier to go from a round-off. I always used to worry about people watching me, but they were in your position once, so they should empathise. Either that, or they'll be too busy doing their own training to be watching!<br>  It will be worrying, of course it will, but your coach will know exactly how to stop you from falling, should anything go wrong.<br>  Also, don't 'half' do it. By that I mean, don't back out halfway through, because that's when accidents happen. Go for it!<br>  Sorry if I just made it worse :S<br>  Good luck!!! xxxx<br>  <br>  Faye, gymnast once upon a time =]|`|raVSbfPOaa	First of all you have to be completely confident of yourself. Don't psych yourself out, the results aren't good I know this from experience! Also you'll obviously have a coach there and he/she can help you with anything. They're trained and would not let anything happen to you. If they suggest you do something to fix your back handspring trust them, they know what they're doing and they're always right. Remember just believe in yourself, you don't have to be perfect right off the bat. After you learn what you need to do and how to jump, see the ground, spring off you're hands it will come naturally and there will be no reason to be scared. <br>  Have fun and hope I helped! :)|`|iLQ87NSUaa	the most important thing in a back handspring is to fully commit. most injuries happen when you tense up or change your mind in mid-motion. just take a deep breath, and decide to go for it, and then fully commit. if you do that, chances are, you will land it|`|MDgVPwU3aa	I'm sure you will do fine. Not to worry. Take a deep breath and you will do your best.
D1beU6MPaa	Hi,<br>  Dansant will face a huge field for this race. He is a five  time graded stakes winner on synthetic surfaces. But he will be facing the likes of Monba, Slew's Tiznow, Col. John, Taigo, Red Rocks, etc. This  is a very talented field, and a very large one to boot. No one ever knows in a race such as this one who wil be the eventual winner. But if he crosses the wire first, he will have earned it, that's for sure. But he has made the cut to get in the race, so that is a big plus. Good luck.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i think you are full of s**t.  your jockey friend would know.<br>  <br>  yes mr 2 cents, i do know this.  what's your point?|`|PwZZJh1taa	FYI short and to the point- did you know 95% of all jockeys have agents who line up their mounts.  most top jocks never even see their mount until its in the paddock. great horses need not be test driven, thats left for cripples at cheap tracks.

6bijfmG0aa	Most of impact! is skits anyway. Last week, there was a total of 19 minutes of wrestling. Nuff said.|`|InX5Pfl5aa	TNA is becoming more fail every week sadly...<br>  <br>  They are doing it to hire some big WWE superstar(or ex WWE superstar)<br>  <br>  What I don't get is why fire stars that have been with TNA for YEARS and made it what it is today...|`|rytSFBbgaa	Yes they are releasing too many wrestlers ive notice lately|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	They are making room to hire more knockouts<br>  <br>  This shows they don't really care about wrestling. Half the matches on iMPACT will be Knockouts matches (just like it was last week). They know guys don't really care about their company if they aren't seeing real T & A|`|67f8894911620eb3f7d20229e26e7d8baa	IDK if they have more younger ppl coming in or what but its just a phase like geting all old wwe ppl and they will hopefully have more matches soon.|`|AkpPTYN2aa	TNA sucks  anyway.|`|bc5EELGhaa	i heard a rumour that the next person to lose in that off the wagon chllenge will be eric young|`|MNIUhMajaa	They're releasing all the losers that show up to impress the people that dont deserve to be impressed by anything their called HYPOCRITES! me and my partner in crime Chris Jericho will solve this problem dont worry.|`|Im6jLPEgaa	Of course we're in a recession.
sNQrJ6cfaa	I think all those shows are fake just like Paul Pierce's injury.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Don't care about the bachelor.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	The Bachelor is a gay show|`|LSXdwRDUaa	What do you mean?|`|6c4a97494a15d39d3f9c5bd11c3ce081aa	Spammers, virus writers, and phishers, etc., care becuase they use spoof sites to lure victims.|`|50PfC3OIaa	I refuse to watch that show. Dumb chicks falling over a fake relationship.|`|T5BshhZWaa	dunno|`|nKxQLZr3aa	no one really cares, its all like a fixed thing anways|`|AA11488609	Don't care about the bachelor.|`|de711i5Vaa	nope
96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	by the looks of this game i think your team will tear liverpool to shreds lmao|`|TKDi70uTaa	loved the way keano passed through the defenders legs for lennon to finish. still 45 to go. you know us ha ha.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Ohh..No its not the same team :)|`|tfotPdeZaa	Ha Ha and they were trying to take advantage of the fact the Carling Cup was on Sunday :) Spurs look great today! <br>  Didnt c the third goal :( Stepped out of the room. I'll watch it later .<br>  <br>  edit: hmm. how many more goals can we get today :)|`|Rds4eGIyaa	Liverpool have not won at the Riverside in a very long time (2001?). They are certainly our bogey side and I just knew that they would beat us grrrrr! Football is a funny old game.|`|f7hrmDVzaa	Yidoooooos!|`|WdOAxQmoaa	COME ON SPURS.........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BRING OUT ANOTHER DVD!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  we would be bringing out to many dvds sins we'v won things and made history. spurs just bring them out once every good game (against Arsenal becouse we'r special) . so did the arsenal 4-4 spurs dvd sell well?|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I haven't seen the goal but how did Liverpool lose to that shocking team?|`|QB3LvbVaaa	Indeed my friend spurs are Truly back
Pc0QjrQ4aa	My view is that for the first time in a long time, the Leafs have a plan.  Build up the farm system, get young, and yes- this won't happen overnight.  They have a precious asset (cap space) that a lot of teams don't have.<br>  <br>  Burke seems about as warm and cuddly as a piranha, but he's not a rube.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	The Boston Red Sox fans used to have a saying and now the Chicago Cubs fans have been saying the same thing for 100 years:<br>  <br>  "Well, there's always next year"<br>  <br>  I think Burke has them going in the right direction, but it's gonna take a good 3-4 years. Look at what the Bruins have done, by going young and signing a few Top Free Agents (Chara and Savard). Their time will come, but unfortunately, the "true" fans can't afford to go now, so what do you think it will be like in 3-4 years?!?!?!|`|O5Q4GP59aa	People need to faith in Burke.<br>  <br>  Losing moore will not do toronto good because he was energetic guy dat's good with Blake.<br>  <br>  toronto need good goalie plus sundin replacement. they need leader.<br>  <br>  And they lose energy guy Tucker before, so now their feeling is lame about energy.<br>  <br>  They will make playoff, but cup is far away from winning.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Knock knock.....Toskala is not gone; Leafs are still paying him and he is on IR.  Leafs are again headed towards Golf course in April.  Harold Ballard's ghost haunts MLG.|`|3HNWZBxMaa	i think they can :)|`|9EYDgS9Saa	I agree about some of the rookies, i think that the leafs do have a plan and are actually going to set it in play, already being done. I think that it will take a few years but in time they will making the playoffs on a regular|`|8uqpB7Gzaa	they will in the next couple years|`|XKsRrY2uaa	no they never will
sqfjfR3iaa	He sells a lot of merchandise and World Wrestling Entertainment is in business to make money. Hornswoggle sells more merchandise than a lot of other wrestlers.|`|g4cYFVrmaa	He's the only little person they have and his gimmick works well with Finlay's.|`|6nY99hPmaa	for the same reason they kept that retard neugene.|`|BAurzDXtaa	Kids love him and we're living in the PG era|`|IgDCjui5aa	because he is unpredictibale and know body thinks of him. So if anything suprising hapens in ecw, 85% of the time its him.|`|bh8AjH3Taa	Don't mock him. He is cool. Best midget there.|`|bLxPLVNJaa	cause he plays pranks that are really good for the storyline|`|qh9EOXKOaa	Because he's a funny midget!!|`|jwcer2Svaa	cause finley might get fired along with him if he quit|`|1z7M3Tntaa	No idea and they release Cabana...im sorry im still holding on to this lol|`|JiCfYfLraa	i dont know but he makes me sick to my damn stomach. i hate that little bastard. come on the wwe making him cruserweight champion like wtf??? the wwe has turned into a damn carnival and that pisses me off.
LUnscegvaa	None really as it's down solely to the individual person.<br>  <br>  But in a no rules situation I'd have to say Karate wins.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|Uaobd0ODaa	karate, no probs. The boxer wouldn't be able to get close enough and the karate guy would be sweeping his feet and getting him on the floor.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	Karate guy, i mean that person has been taught how to use kicks, punches, knees, elbows, throws, joint locks, sweeps, and not to mention is this was a street fight the Karate guy would proably do some throat strike, or other lethal technique   <br>  <br>  >while the boxer only knows who to use punches, <br>  <br>  and for those people who dont think Karate can not be used aggressively check out Andy Hug, lyoto machida, both high level karate fighters who have destroyed, boxers, and kickboxers|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	boxing-2 weapons Karate-as many weapons as you know how to use.<br>  considering the level of the fighters in your question obviously the karate guy would win.however that would depend on the rules,no rules the karate guy would win,boxing rules most probably the boxer would win.|`|OFCCgLdKaa	You've made that a completely unfair match up... best in the world vs a black belt which anyone can become with enough practise. My money would be on the boxer, if he is best in the world then obviously he's going to be stronger, faster and just as agile as the karate practitioner.|`|1f74df53253928939a96bcca2aa1e1b8aa	I think without a doubt it would be karate especially if the guy was Japanese,they are the masters of the art<br>  Can't believe people think a boxer would beat a martial arts master|`|cFMFNVj8aa	if it were a fight using only the fists then the boxer would win but if there were no rules the karateka  would use sweeps, kicks and throws and the boxer by default wouldn't have any defenses to these moves and get destroyed in a matter of seconds but if it were a boxer from the Dan Mandoza days he would have knowledge to defend these attacks because their used to theese moves the all the time in their fights.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	I would put my money on the Karate guy. Although a good boxer isn't an easy person to fight and they know how to take a hit better. Plus they can jab and are faster punchers.... But the karate guy doesn't just use his hands so he has the advantage. He could stay out of the boxers range and also he can use takedowns. Boxing is just to restricted...I don't like it.<br>  <br>  Oh and Empire....its not just a black belt its a 10th degree. Which not just anybody....in fat almost nobody can get to. And youre usually an old man when you get to it because it takes so many years of devotion and training.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	If the Karateka had full contact expierence, i'd give him a fighting chance.  Boxer still has the edge in kicking range; also depends on the rules though.  A no rules situation, the Karateka has too many options.  In a ring, the boxer takes it.|`|htD82ij1aa	karate, boxers use force and good karate masters know how to use their opponents force against them.|`|oAAr4aEJaa	Boxer - karate's for fags|`|qE7Er3pRaa	karate coz the boxer would finally get tired.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Depends on which fighter knows more about the other persons fighting style.|`|fox5a3ePaa	The boxer would slaughter him|`|WWnkLkqqaa	To get a 10th Dan Blackbelt takes a lifetimes dedication, he would probably be too old, but if you put in the Best Martial Artist who studies Karate he would probably win, the boxer has limited ability and strikes whereas with karate there is an abundance of techniques that could finish an opponent.|`|ySXUvX96aa	boxer for one good reason boxing is the best street fighting martial art a karate dude would not last you see in films and copatitions karate use kicks with timing cos your both using karate but in a street fight you dont get many opatunatys and a boxer has really strong force mike tyson would k.o and karate black belt|`|MaFw69ePaa	while the pugilist relies on one method the karateka knows many and is versatile and enduring. the karateka would win.|`|VlvQ69Qgaa	Easily the karate guy, even if he is a fag he would have much more skill than the boxer. But a black belt taekwondo master would destroy both of them.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	doesnt matter with ranks. depends just how they react to each other. its 2 completely different styles. thats a dumb question to ask.|`|PAf4VDUOaa	the boxer, because karate is self defense whilst boxing is more agressive, painful damagingg ect.|`|Y4dr9Wfmaa	Karate, because every punch from the boxer would be turned against him, he would go down fighting|`|0hdAwwWOaa	karate is better because there are many things you can do to deavastate your opponent|`|hi0J8zZPaa	karate coz the boxer will punch and the karate guy would block and beat the **** out of the boxer|`|3Y3pAZrZaa	Karate, there's more skill and coordination.|`|1vRNaSgOaa	the boxer obviously|`|VmujqxtZaa	karate just think about it all a boxer can do is punch and if i keep my distance and head in when his off balance his done for|`|a70n2IK4aa	karate|`|btIvC1esaa	boxer|`|ZEAqJM4iaa	The one who got the first incapacitating shot in of course|`|AA11182621	The Karate Guy|`|Gm8hdDfeaa	The one who will also fight with is mind and soul...not only with his body...
2GMvuliVaa	Their was no point in bringing him back in the first place if they weren't going to keep him.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I didn't like the gimmick at all, but I feel bad for the guy.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Once he had a sidekick and the character became a cartoon...he was on borrowed time. It was a strong character - though the company pulled out all the Papa Shango gear from the vault - pre-injury.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I hope it's for good this time. He has been released a few times before.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	sarcastic voice damn what a shame not|`|adPpTL47aa	I cant belive it. I wonder what happend. I heard he was supposed to wrestle tonight for a MITB shot|`|c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	Yup unfortuneatly|`|ETkqlgqwaa	Oh My God =[ That sucks. He was great. He got a bit boring, but I'd like to see him as a heel or in more main event matches. That's really shocking. He was original. Damn|`|LuhTYk0Maa	I just hope he doesnt get a job at TNA , the last thing TNA needs is more stupid gimmicks, but im sure he made millions.|`|97jqpA54aa	oh god <br>  they are released like everyone|`|wZOO4Icwaa	snap, hope striker trys to explain this away on E.C.W.
xRPjgGs1aa	Yes there will be a upset which involves the Heat because there team has really came back due to the healthy Wade.|`|4xFUhMXOaa	Well in the West...<br>  I think any upsets would involve the Utah Jazz. They always play well against good teams, and their team is getting healthier and healthier.<br>  As for the East...<br>  The Miami Heat might upset a good team b/c of D-Wade being healthy.<br>  Also Michael Beasley has to play well.|`|7pIMhDNPaa	probably|`|T5BshhZWaa	good teams will win so no|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	It depends on your definition of "upset".<br>  <br>  Any time the Lakers win with #24 in their lineup upsets me (before the number change, it used to be #8).<br>  <br>  As for an underdog defeating a favored opponent, I can see the Heat (or Pistons, if they ever regain the chemistry they lost) upsetting a contender.  Maybe that's been the Pistons' plan all along, to act like they lost chemistry so they could claim a weaker seed in order to upset a team like Cleveland or the Magic in the first round (if so, that wouldn't be the brightest of ideas, but if it works, more power to the Pistons).  Out West, I see a Lakers-Spurs matchup in the Conference Finals, and regardless of who wins (I'm predicting a Spurs victory there, and if the matchup becomes a reality, I'm also hoping for a Spurs victory), I wouldn't consider it an upset.<br>  <br>  The playoffs would be boring if there wasn't at least one upset, and with teams like the Heat and Pistons not considered "contenders" at present, I fully expect either (but not both) of them to break the monotony out East.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Yes, there will be an upset with the Heat and Atlanta when they find out they aren't in the west, they are in the east|`|56Mb4BXIaa	no, if there is an upset, it would be Utah Beating LA lakers in the conference finals or before that. Only if utah is 100% percent healthy...|`|LSXdwRDUaa	I was thinking of the Bull or Knick beating the 1st player seed.  <br>  And i was thinking of Detroit winning it all.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	to the celtics fan YES<br>  <br>  to the lakers fan NO|`|v77SnunOaa	suns over lakers 1st round
j3iP5iwHaa	Yes i did!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GO BENGALS|`|M8nKPtDiaa	yep its a good move|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Yes. It just happened . 4 years for 28 million. It is a great move for the Bengals. As a Bengals fan I love it. He is cheaper than T.J. would have been and is faster. Chad Johnson and Laveraneus Coles will be fun to watch. Great Day to be a Bengals fan.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	lmao he just moved down in franchise's <br>  <br>  never a good move|`|Szf3UEVNaa	are u seriouse!!!! wow good for them...it soks that he will sok. lol he has no qb!!! palmers done for and the other fool whats his name.....|`|YFFhkRSdaa	yeah housh is way way better but coles n him have the same skill set|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	Good move but they need to get more fa's now!|`|AOA8TJraaa	Holy $h!T!!! Damn that sucks...
jYOZfZpXaa	I agree with you, most of the attention was drawn to Chad wich took the heat of TJ. I think that he is over hyped but will still be good in Seattle because he has a good veteran QB in Matt Hasselback. But with him being the #1 reciever i think he will finally get to see that he isn't always going to be open and really has to run his routes and realize there is always gonna be a defender on him and he wont get many YAC(Yards after catch).<br>  <br>  Another classic example of this is Wes Welker in New England. He wasn't anything special on offense when he was with Miami but now he comes to the Patriots and he had like the most catches in a season and he made a pro bowl, and thats mostly because Randy Moss is getting all the attention and Welker is getting the underneath passes.

CttL3LmBaa	Synthetic motor oil now days is certainly thin enough for chain use.  the molecular structure of synthetic oil is fantastic and is great at what it is designed to do - resist high sheer loads in an engine.  That is all it is really good for.  On a chain you do not have sheer but rotational friction inside the roller at the pin.  That is actually the only place that the lubrication is necessary.  The very reason why chain lubricants are made to penetrate is the outside needs no lubrication.<br>  <br>  You don't want to use motor oil because it will:<br>  1. Sling off the chain as it it made to film off of parts and be pumped though a filter and back into engine parts.  Engineers worked really hard to make it perfect for that job.<br>  2.  Attract dirt.  Another property that those good petroleum engineers did was make a product that carries the contaminants to the filter.  Bikes don't of course have that filter so the gritty material will wear your chain and gears.<br>  3.  It is wash out resistant.  Good for resisting rain, but it resists mild chain cleaners too.  Oh, you can cut it, but usually to remove it all you need a solvent not detergent.<br>  <br>  The types of products you want for a chain:<br>  1.  Wax based "dry" lubricant.  This is a modern formulation of a wax made to emulate paraffin that used to be melted onto chains.  This new chemical mix is a carrying solvent and wax that penetrates where you need it and the solvent evaporates leaving the wax behind to do the lubrication.  Since wax is dry no attraction of dirt.  Wax is also very water proof so it's good in the rain.  Draw back is that this formula is the hardest to clean off a chain, and your chain had to be thoroughly cleaned of any petroleum before using.  It won't stick to the metal of the chain with a petroleum film in the way.  Read the label.<br>  2. Dry Teflon Lube.  Very good lubrication as Teflon is the slipperiest substance known.  It works with a carrying agent just like the wax.  It is a bit wetter as the carrier has a light oil to try to keep the Teflon in place as Teflon itself is transferable.  Too slippery to stay on it's own when not baked on like a frying pan.  Teflon as a lubricant is like tiny micron sized bearings and they are in the plastic family.  They wont break down in water but can be flushed out easily with detergents that break down the carrying oil.<br>  3. Wet lubes.  Think of them as just better oil for the task than motor oil.  They still attract dirt and need more cleaning.  Water resistant to rain and actually the best choice in the rain, as long as you know you will have a cleaning job when you are done in the rain.<br>  4.  New tech ceramic impregnated lube.  This is the new twist on the wax and Teflon.  A carrier bring ceramic powder that burnishes onto the metal.  It takes a couple applications to get it right with break in riding in between. (read the label)  It promises to be the best of all words -- if it works.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	I say NO without having any facts to back my opinion. Have never seen any facts to justify expensive commercial chain lube either. Lots of hype, but no facts. Maybe somebody can point us to them.<br>  <br>  Clean well, oil, and wipe down real good. Use the lowest weight oil you can get. The wiping is important to retard the accumulation of road grit on the exterior parts of the chain.<br>  <br>  I think one of the selling points of chain lubes is less accumulation of grit, and they aren't as messy when applying. After a few miles tho, my chains are just as black using chain lubes as with motor oil. And the crap won't hardly wash out of fabric, especially anything synthetic.<br>  <br>  Sheldon Brown in the link talks about "oil" without specifying anything.<br>  <br>  Edit: Give McG the 10 points he deserves for the most informed answer.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Motor oil is too thick to use on bicycle chains.  You want a thin mineral oil that can get into the rollers and provide lubrication. You never want to oil a dirty chain because it will wash the grit into the rollers.  You want to degrease the chain and remove the grid before oiling.  Never use WD-40<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/chain-lubrication/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/chain-lubricatio...</a><br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/no-wd40-bike-chain/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/no-wd40-bike-cha...</a>|`|853858348b51a4efbb0e5afe428b91aeaa	Other than Making a Mess and wearing off, Nothing.<br>  <br>  if you use Oil for Bicycle chains, it has a ingredient that bonds to the chain to protect it from moisture,  regular motor oil does not have this, and comes off the chain during use.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	regular oils attract dirt and break down faster. bicycle lube with teflon is the best ( finishline) brand.  i know i've had to clean up lots of chains and drive lines. use to have own shop and still do maint & repair.|`|93140be05c6b1ce95eb4a326840fedcdaa	Oil is oil, I use any oil on my bike.|`|AA10244209	Yes -- it attracts dirt and grime like there's no tomorrow, and any bike shop mechanic that has to work on your rig is going to want to punch you in the head.<br>  <br>  As a bicycle mechanic, nothing annoys me more.  Spend $7 on a tube of synthetic, bicycle-specific chain lube -- it's designed to lubricate without attracting more dirt into the chain (which reduces its lifespan).  Only requires a few drops.  A tube should last you at least a year.|`|YGbiIxq4aa	Yes! Don't be cheap, get the good stuff.  But if you are asking this question, you are probably stupid enough that you bought your bike from walmart, so go ahead, smoother it in motor oil and have fun.

Montador is going to blow your socks off he will be the most solid D man we have had since Alberts left and he doesn't take a penalty unless it is a must,loosing Nokelainen may sting in the future but he is very young and very unproven. Karsums shows promise and Lashoff will be a steady 2nd or 3rd line D man for many years but will never be in the same class as Montador. I think overall it was a good deadline for the B's and they have a second round pick next draft. Just an added note  the smallest part of the dealings was Recchi but he will give us much needed experience up to and through the playoffs, if someone ask you right now would you trade Karsums Lashoff and Nokelainen for a cup would you say yes or no?|`|QSShHlRiaa	They did horrible personally im disappointed<br>  they traded a future great defensive propspect.<br>  For an old time wingman.

IoyJXzoyaa	That's a tough one.  I really like the idea of a .17 hmr, and my uncle even has one.  I in fact almost bought into the hype when they were new and got one myself.  Then I got practical.  The fact of the matter is that a .17 hmr holds little advantage over a standard .22 lr from all that I have been able to research.<br>  <br>  Both are limited to small game hunting only.  <br>  <br>  Both are equally capable of 1 shot kills on all small game with the proper load. Thus neither has an "effective" advantage on killing power.<br>  <br>  Both are relativily easy to find at commercial gun stores these days, but the .22 defintly has more variety.<br>  <br>  The .22lr  has a max effective range of about 100 yards for small game. <br>  <br>  The .17hmr has a max effective range of about 150 yards for small game.<br>  <br>  The .22 lr is the cheapest and most abundant ammunition on the planet, with a variety of loads specilized for any task from plinking, to target shooting, to coyote hunting.<br>  <br>  The .17 hmr has limited selection of loads, and none are truely suitable for plinking due to being massively more expensive than even the best .22 lr loads.  They are also less likely to be in stores that don't sell .17 cal guns.  Stores that don't even sell guns often still carry a selection of .22lr ammo, although as they become more popular that may change...but who are we kidding.<br>  <br>  So to wrap it up, an extra 50+ yards of effective range at more than double the cost per shot with a .17 wasn't worth it to me, so I got a .22 instead.  However, if I already had a .22 and a larger gun like a .243, I might consider ia .17 should I be gun shopping again. If just for something else to shoot that's different but affordable, as .17 is still cheaper than any centerfire rifle loads. Still, everyone should own a good .22 before buying a .17 IMHO though.|`|GHD8JicSaa	WalMart in more and more cases is bowing to the Liberal gun-ban agenda and is removing rifles from their stores,  even in rural areas.  <br>  I would in this case recommend you look at your local gun stores or hardware stores before going to WalMart.<br>  <br>  Before you go buy one of these new 17 calibers,  you might want to compare the price of ammo.    The 22 LR and 22 MAG are not that much worse in ballistics and the ammo is a lot cheaper.|`|5VELZt7Saa	they got them here:<a href="http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/default.php?cPath=9935_13987_14246_16479&sort=3a&filter_id=115" rel="nofollow">http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/default....</a> <br>  for less than $250 to start plus shipping,that caliber beats the crap out of any .22|`|266ceb85ba0b67055921349df27eadb2aa	I have been very pleased with my Savage .22 and my Savage .308.  I don't know how much they cost but both of my rifles are more accurate than I am.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	Savage makes nice rimfire rifles.  I suggest considering the cost-effectiveness of the .22LR cartridge instead of the .17 HMR.<br>  <br>  If you're varmint hunting at short distances, the .22LR is sufficient.  If you're shooting at longer distances, the your .243 rifle has the situation covered.  And the .22LR is more economical and commonly available.|`|AA12034449	17 is a dandy cartridge... but In my opinion I'd by a good rifle in .22 LR.<br>  <br>  A lot cheaper to feed and .22 will do just about everything your .243 wont.

AA10160841	If you're talking about the Ryan Whitney for Chris Kunitz trade, I think it's obvious that Kunitz is really giving the team a boost that has been needed.

Depending on your preferences you can get a fixed blade from 4-5 to 10-12 inches long. They come in all sizes and shapes.

A knife is only designed to cut, and shouldn't be used as a screwdriver, prybar, bottle opener or anything else (you risk injury to yourself & damage to the knife); if that's what you want then stick with a Swiss Army Knife, or get a larger 'Leatherman style' mulit-tool (Victorinox and Leatherman being the two brands I would recommend, but you could go with SOG or Gerber if you're on a tight budget).<br>  <br>  I would describe a lot of the Kershaw line, designed by Ken Onion, as 'groovy looking'. Spyderco also makes some 'unique' designs. As a general rule, Spyderco offers higher quality and Kershaw offers a lower price, but their ranges are so varied that the two overlap somewhat.<br>  <br>  What to look for? Well, you'll want a good utility blade-shape if you're just doing odd-jobs around the house; I'd avoid tanto, hawkbill & spearpoint blades. They may look 'cool' but they lack versatility. I'd go for a plain edge blade rather than one with serrations; it'll be much easier to sharpen and is better suited for precision tasks (opposed to serrations which are designed to just 'tear' through tough material). Handle material is down to your own personal preference, but I find G10 is my favourite; it's very tough, offers a lot of grip and won't wear/scratch nearly as much as any other material. I won't go into blade steel choices as there is just too much to cover.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the Byrd Robin G10 as a smaller knife (about 2" cutting edge), Spyderco Delica as a great 'do everything' knife (about 2.5" cutting edge), and the Spyderco Tenacious if you want something bigger (just over 3" cutting edge). The Tenacious is probably the best knife there is for its price ($30-$40ish).|`|QxtdyNvgaa	you scared me first with the question!<br>  <br>  if you want a good swiss army knife then buy a army knife which has many functions and is quite strong.<br>  test it out aswell!|`|GXCIQpVKaa	Many Swiss Army style knives or multi-tools can be used for the tasks you mentioned.

I could actually go to one!|`|xGxHkj8faa	Bristol because of the beating and banging short track style|`|cMLJPQpBaa	I gotta say Atlanta... but Darlingtons in my heart|`|j3QosG68aa	martinsville iz my favurite trak. i like tubesteak and carp|`|y3j27KMYaa	for the show of course Bristol, and for the intrest the Glenn, what a great road course !|`|i8soZLfRaa	I like most of them, but my favorite is Darlington.|`|Tn4Na3r7aa	michigan.......party............party|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Talladega and Dover :)|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Richmond and Hendricksville|`|W2R8TRDmaa	To watch a race at in person, its Martinsville.|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	Bristol or Lowes. I cant choose between the two.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	Fontana|`|y7jE63ULaa	Bristol|`|yt4PN1R4aa	Dover|`|GCOrku95aa	I've been to Dover a lot, but none of the other tracks, so I can't answer on a live-experience basis, but I love watching the racing there on TV as well. Bristol and Atlanta are up there on my list as well. Charlotte provides good racing, Vegas tends to be good, the plate tracks are more boring than exciting, but can be fun to watch, I like Watkins Glen. I guess I like almost all of them.|`|PJhwWVcMaa	Daytona and Talladega are my favorites because of the way they draft in big packs and the unpredictability. I've been to Daytona four times and love it. I would love to go to Bristol or Martinsville someday too. Infineon and Watkins Glen are also cool because it's something different.|`|2kg7nWX5aa	Well, I have only been to two tracks ,Gateway and Kansas.I would say Gateway( in person)<br>  On T.V. Bristol. I so want to go there.|`|Xw7XHhg6aa	Talledega <br>  <br>  It was Bristol before it got resurfaced|`|ChzeqFjlaa	Talladega and Daytona cause Junior is a BEASSSST there!!!!|`|ndX4Je5Oaa	dover is alot of fun there|`|0MuRCU5paa	Bristol.|`|tiYlMGATaa	Dega|`|9vcZjFl6aa	michigan  gas milage|`|kEhscv02aa	talledaga|`|c3tADklmaa	Dover since it's close and exciting!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Sonoma.<br>  This week anyway, it changes constantly.<br>  I'm a favorite track flip-flopper.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.....short Track - Bristol<br>  .....Intermediate-Lowe's<br>  .....Superspeedway-Talladega|`|a4LWildhaa	Phoenix.

I also like Martinsville and Richmond...and I will always love The Rock, to bad Nascar no longer races there.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I like Pocono because of it's three distinct turns. <br>  I like the technical aspect of the performance it demands from the cars.<br>  It's a different kind of race that takes from the driver and puts more upon the technicians, and crew.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	For pure entertainment it would be Bristol and Martinsville.<br>  <br>  I like wathcing the road courses but just when they get really interesting they are over. Need to practice F1 rules and have only local cautions.|`|qxrr69bnaa	Actually I have 3 (in no particular order):  Bristol, Richmond and Talladega.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Hands down Darlington.

uS8hK7Zhaa	McMahon Helmsley era!!!<br>  <br>  I loved them on their power trip. They were actually evil. Edge & Vickie are just annoying|`|IgDCjui5aa	100 % agree, just for storyline. Triple h and stephanie real they actualy do have 2 children togeter.at first fake but nw real. edge and vicke totaly fake.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Triple H & Stephine<br>  <br>  both looks great as a couple, had a better storyline. Edge was cool with Lita but Vickie Guerrero looks too old & fat for him.|`|AA10425091	fake|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Triple H and Stephanie. It actually seemed real when they were a couple. You can feel this connection they had. With Edge and Vickie, you can tell they don't really have a connection.|`|wZOO4Icwaa	HHH+stephanie, 3 reasons, 1 coz u cat get more powerful than the wwe champion and a macmahon, 2 vickie and edge are fake, and finally HHH would pwn edge|`|bLxPLVNJaa	i like hhh annd stephanie better but edge and vickie have more power cause edge has the world heavyweight and vickie is the general manager|`|Im6jLPEgaa	Edge & Vickie because their abuse of power is kayfabe whereas Triple H and Stephanie's is real.|`|hWCkg4upaa	Stephanie by herself is fine by me.lol|`|IfzmWSevaa	Triple h and stephanie because they are not as arrogant as edge and vickie and stephanie doesnt say excuse me every 5 seconds and triple h doesnt cheat <3|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Triple H and Stephanie,because they worked much better on screen together,(well they really were a couple so). And they had a much better storyline.A lot more believable too.As Vickie and Edge thing has gone on long enough honestly.No one believed it from the start,and it has been going on so long now that people have just really accepted it.But Triple H and Stephanie actually had good on screen romantic chemistry.(Well we know why).As for Edge and Vickie it is quite obvious that they do not actually love each other.And I don't know why the wwe wants everyone to forget that Edge went nuts when Vickie put him in a Hell In A Cell with the Undertaker,and he cheated on her.Well know I think with this Big Show thing it is finally over.But I definitely like Triple H and Stephanie as on screen couple because they were much better together on screen and I did like the whole McMahon-Helmsly era storyline i found it quite entertaining to watch,as Vickie and Edge I think has gone on long enough already.
uS8hK7Zhaa	That peon doesn't even deserve to be in the same conversation as Mr. McMahon.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers the question, lol|`|AA10517199	Mcmahon i guess. he is cooler than mr jeff jarrett. he can kiss it|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Vince McMahon was born to be the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment.  He's brilliant at what he does; and I love to see him get his @$$ kicked....<br>  <br>  I applaud Jarrett for everything that he has done with TNA.  But Vince McMahon is the better of the two.  Hands down...
U5q7k3Geaa	He is EXTREMELY Annoying and overrated.<br>  He is too boring to talk about.|`|YH0NobYmaa	HE just has to much ego and ya i dont like him ethier and thats just how he is but he doesnt have yellow teeth by the way and i think you just wasted 5 pts on this but thats just my thoughts|`|fvMv1DT3aa	No, he does not behave like a retard. He is a heel and he has a gimmick that he is acting out.|`|BglekVnQaa	When I first saw Jack I thought he was a bit slow. I mean look at his stupid smile. I think he is.|`|5nAnWp3daa	agrees|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	He is a VERY annoying heel... I can't stand him!...|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Its called a gimmick....|`|AA11482019	He looks like a bleached blonde Jethro Bodine.
B8sJEBxTaa	Well they both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the way I see it is: Manning has better mechanics, but Brady has done more.|`|Szf3UEVNaa	everyone who picked peyton manning is wrong.. i will prove it. Tom Brady May now have the best recievers in the leauge now but look back 5 years. who was his starting reciever? A guy called Brown. he won 3 superbowls with no name receivers he repalced a franchise face called drew bledsoe. he won 3 superbowls manning only one. manning had harrison for all of his career now he has wayne and gonzalez. tom brady did not have a RB called James who was a great great RB for the colts.  <br>  Now he is a threat. He has a RB by the name of Fred Talyor. He has 2 probowl wirde receivers. he now has an offensive line. he has a great coach.<br>  <br>  is that enough for you?????????? TOm BRADY IS THE BEST!!!!! QB EVER!<br>  More then JOe MONTANA!!! FOR THE SAME REASON!!!!!|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Manning would be great anytime, anywhere.<br>  You woulda never heard of Brady if he didn't land at exactly the right place at the right time.|`|LmFVTUkHaa	I would say payton manning all day,When di manning have a bad year, never.Let tom play some more years to see.There were tons of qbs that had great years then were nothing to talk about.|`|vWRk0gViaa	Peyton Manning!!!!!|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Who is a better quarterback:<br>  <br>  Your Mom (Manning) or your Dad (Brady)|`|j7i0zPpWaa	Manning hands down|`|AOA8TJraaa	Damn that's tough.<br>  <br>  Brady!!!|`|qOoiykXMaa	Manning no question......he has the better technique.......he's just a better athlete. It doesn't matter how many Rings Brady got on his fingers|`|Xz2qlQrYaa	Peyton, no contest. Now that Brady is coming back from the injury, he'll suck.|`|yOy59kjRaa	TOM BRADY|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Man, tough question, well im going to go on pure truth. Peyton certainly is a great qb and as is brady and they are both going to the hall of fame. Tom's advantages: Stronger arm, less int's (so not as many mistakes), record setting season, more sb's (big one there), peyton: more yards, more td's, great audibler. So we could go all day about this but im saying tom because he is younger, and has more rings. Oh and brady does better against manning (especially in the post season)|`|ubGNtkHQaa	This is the 1000000000000 time this question has been asked. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. But haters will say something like "choke artist" or "18-1", etc|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Entirely opinion.<br>  <br>  I prefer Manning because of his game management but obviously wouldn't complain about having Brady as a QB|`|JTSNljLhaa	Brady play all his games outdoor in bad weather,while manning is playing in a dome half the time and cant play in bad weather(snow rain ect)<br>  <br>  manning throw to many ints when weather dont go his way|`|Z03zgM0maa	Completely subjective. They are both great but I think Tom Brady has done more with less. He's won 3 rings without a star receiver and when he finally got Moss, he broke records|`|mTSOJKlyaa	Peyton Manning
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Definitely Chris Jericho as he's the more gifted and charismatic Superstar.He works an excellent style of technical Lucha Libre wrestling and can put on exciting matches and cut entertaining promos and in-ring segments.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chris-jericho-tribute/1739721421/?icid=VIDURVENT10" rel="nofollow">http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chr...</a>|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Edge as he is the best heel of today.<br>  <br>  Well... besides Robert Rhoode...

Chris jericho used to be better when he feuded with Miheals but after that he didnt get any better storyline. His legend storyline is goin gud but not doing much for him unless he beat a legend like Ric Flair or Hogan like he beat Snuka or Ricky.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	both are my favorite most.<br>  <br>  Edge : 99<br>  Jericho : 100<br>  <br>  this one point difference is just cause Jericho is a bit better in ring performer, otherwise both are great heels, both have there own awesome mic styles, both really entertains in their own wonderful ways.|`|juNwy1aTaa	I have a my favorite baby face wrestlers, I have my favorite heels, Edge has always been my favorite heel. He's so good at what he does. Hate him or love him, he's an excellent wrestler and an excellent performer.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Y2J, Edge is just a pansy hiding behind Vickie all the time. His gimmick is that of a coward|`|bc5EELGhaa	i love chris jericho but at the moment i think it would have to be edge he rocks|`|JmK3Bgdyaa	edge.if i had to pick :P|`|qbEeecndaa	yeah edge at the moment|`|U5q7k3Geaa	BREAK THE CODE<br>  SaVe uS 222|`|iSIZMz2maa	Chris Jericho. He has more ability on the mic and in the ring.|`|gr6bcnztaa	Y2J <br>  he's a wrestling genius in my opinion his matches are always something different to watch|`|AkpPTYN2aa	Edge.<br>  <br>  But he has too many title reigns.|`|7JbOTO7Faa	Jericho all the way! SAVE US Y2J!!!!

6tGYe5roaa	I think that overall the Big East has the better teams and more depth. Aside from UNC, all the top teams in the Big East are better than the top ACC teams. Duke is the second best team in the ACC, while Louisville and Pitt are the second and third best in the Big East; both these teams are better than Duke. When you compare both conferences team by team, the Big East wins. They have the better teams.|`|kTbCarenaa	I'm an ACC fan bcause most of the colleges are in the Carolinas, but I have to give this one to the Big East.|`|VjJJSvxnaa	i'm a cincy alum - so i may have a little bias- but i will say they are close. I would give the edge to the big east. You can't tell me that the ACC is nearly as deep: UNC V Uconn, Duke v Pitt, Clemson v Louisville, FSU  v Marquette, Wake v anyone in the big east...i'll take the big east|`|ONrFDcUTaa	the big east is a power house, they for the most part have the most teams in the tourney every year<br>  plus, in my opinion their best teams, pitt, uconn, marquette, and louisville are easily better than the Acc's best- unc duke wake and bc|`|7bx2XQlqaa	Im an ACC fan and I still think the BIG EAST is better.  Coach K is kidding himself if he thinks the ACC is better.  I belive UNC is the best team in the country, but over the BIG EAST is better.  The ACC is definetly the second best though.|`|IhuSUSWUaa	This Big East is better this season but I also think the ACC's having a down year.  I think we'll have to see in the next few years how well each league plays.
smFHGStuaa	They will....<br>  <br>  LOST ON DEFENSE: B. Scott, Corey Ivy, Jim Leonard, Chris McCallister, Samari Rolle (maybe... he asked to be released)<br>  <br>  If they loose Ray Lewis they are in full rebuilding mode... they need O-line, WR, and maybe another RB.<br>  <br>  I expect to see a top tier D-back taken by the Ravens in the draft... Malcolm Jenkins (Ohio) or Alfonso Smith (Wake Forest) likely they will have to trade up a little bit to get one.|`|daRDQE9maa	heck yeah they did.. There defense wouldn't of been nothing losing bart scott and Ray Lewis.. How ever i still think they draft a young big one in the draft some where to be mentored by this MONSTER! lol :P|`|AOA8TJraaa	hope he does|`|MxHRjPFHaa	they are working on it but it looks like he will re-sign with them|`|mTSOJKlyaa	Adam Schefter<br>  Lewis expected to re-sign with Ravens soon<br>  <br>  Posted: March 4th, 2009 | Adam Schefter | Tags: Baltimore Ravens, Free Agency 2009, Ray Lewis<br>  <br>  Now that Kurt Warner’s deal is done in Arizona, the next big deal is on deck.<br>  <br>  By the end of the week, and quite possibly in the next 24 hours, the Ravens and free-agent linebacker Ray Lewis are expected to finalize a deal as important to Baltimore as Warner’s is to Arizona, league sources said Wednesday.<br>  <br>  The deal also is expected to be for less than the three years and $24 million that some have speculated. But it’s not the numbers that matter to the Ravens and their fans. it’s having Lewis’ deal completed and having him back in Baltimore.|`|gYRfWcleaa	After losing Brown, Scott, Leonhard, McCallister, possibly Rolle and Ivy THEY better sign Lewis! <br>  I think the Ravens lost too many good players because they have been waiting around to see what Ray Lewis is going to do. If he doesn't sign I will be really angry. I think he is a great player but I don't know if he is worth losing 3 top notch young other players!
FUoKu13Daa	you are comparing apple and oranges,<br>  <br>  They play different positions and their approach to the game is different,<br>  <br>  But if you are asking who had a better career or who made more of an impact of the game then it is Michael Jordan.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Both great players but Jordan is the greatest player in NBA history.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  Jordan's right up there as the best ever. It should always be remembered that without Scottie Pippen the 6 championships would never have happened. But Magic was also on a great team.<br>  <br>  Go with Jordan..he's the best ever...Magic is Top 10, so he can't be better. In college it was much closer, Magic was better there. And Magic was better in his rookie year. But it's still MJ overall.<br>  <br>  I would prefer to compare Magic with Le Bron...a big man who plays multiple positions. Go with Magic.|`|AA11758036	Good question, They  both were great players with different roles.  Michael without question was the more exciting to watch, one on one nobody could stop him, a very good defender and simply a feared opponent.  However, I personally think Magic Johnson was the consummate team player. He had an incredible Basketball IQ, he made guys around him better and his will to win was contagious. Magic was coach on the floor and could expose the weakness of any team. Basketball is a team sport so Magic gets my vote.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Michael Jordan and Magic shouldn't even be in the discussion.<br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  Hey "IDIOT" above me, what does Scottie "Overrated" Pippen has to do with this? Magic had a 6 TIME LEAGUE MVP in Kareem Abdul Jabbar & a 1X Finals MVP in James Worthy. What did Jordan have? A 1X "All-Star MVP" in Scottie Pippen....LMFAO!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	Michael Jordan is a player that cannot be compared to, cuz he is a player u can not find a word to describe him, the best word i could describe him is PERFECT!|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Dude, this is no competition, Jordan is better without a doubt. 6 NBA Championships and MVP's there. 5 time regular season MVP, 14 time all-star and 10 time 1st team all defense aaaand he's the got the 3rd most points in NBA history. I can't even remember all the other things MJ did but he is definately (One of) the greatest to ever play the game. Magic was good but he's no MJ.|`|xMJXJPrDaa	You cannot put this two in the same category. First of all, Magic got everyone involve and try to win team ball. Jordan is a take-over-the game kinda guy with a lot of success. <br>  <br>  One's mentality was shoot first past second while the other is pass first then shoot<br>   Lets better look at it this way<br>  Best <br>  PG: Magic<br>  SG:Jordan<br>  SF:Lebron<br>  PF:Tim Duncan<br>  C:Shaq|`|VjXSX7nyaa	Michael Jordan for sure he is much better player,much better dunker and he is the best NBA player in history!!!|`|Ct6NMwwjaa	Jordan|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Magic Johnson|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	this is a stupid question.<br>  JORDAN IS THE BEST EVERRRRR!!!!!!!!<br>  GO JORDAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|REL0ncBbaa	HELLO!!!!!!!

AA12089900	I think it would be difficult to find a ref who isn't biased when it comes to an old firm.  I think it's possible that they're unconsciously 'missing' bad challenges, hand balls etc & some of them just do it because they can|`|5Agn35EKaa	No Chris, bad decisions go in favour of all teams, it is just that when it is in the old firms favour, more notice is taken. All fans have to admit it is not the first time their own team has benefitted from a bad ref. Ref's are not biased in favour of any of the old firm, they do make mistakes based on a lot of factors, like what is visible from their angle at a particular moment.|`|cjFlSlGnaa	yes totally agree, its aboot time the refs stood up2 celtic players and ther unspoertsmanlike play..huv a wee star<br>  <br>  52 in the bag * * * * *|`|YWhqzk73aa	Yes as long as they  chop off rangers goals and give wee teams like ICT penalties in the last min, long may it continue, ha ha

qOoiykXMaa	i agree...do some long distance sprints...like for example sprint from one goal line to the other full speed, rest there for 30 seconds and sprint back......do that a couple of times and it will give you incredible leg strength....also: don't focus on weight lifting too much.....it's good to lift weights but focus on speed and agility, especially going to line backer....work on some core....doesn't matter what your coach thinks, prove him wrong.....I hope I could help...|`|EZ5ZSdKKaa	im a reciever, so i do alot with speed and agility and etc. <br>  <br>  well first, i know that it sucks, but alot of extra conditioning. i ran long distance and sprints everyday last summer and my 40 time went up half a second. also if you want more speed, squats, extensions, and calf raises. our blood backer actually revolves his workout around legs, but he is a fullback too. i do legs and bi, and chest and tri days as a reciever tho. but that is my suggestion. sry if thats not what your looking for but thats what i did to gain speed last year. good luck bro
50PfC3OIaa	Bosh would be great for that team. He actually tries to play defense.|`|iNcdGwmiaa	No way Amare. That guy won't play defense. He has yet, after 8 years in the League, average 10 rebounds a game. Besides that he is dumber than a box of rocks<br>  <br>  Chris Bosh for the Bulls. That would be great for that franchise.<br>  <br>  <br>  But won't Bosh's hometown Mavericks make a big money play for him?|`|xRPjgGs1aa	bosh he has better defense and can hit half-court shots.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Chris Bosh for sure. He's shown he can carry a crappy team by himself (or atleast with very little help) and he doesn't have very many injuries so he's also a better long term bet. Amare is definately a superstar but he's got some big time injuries and he hasn't been able to carry his team very far. Plus Bosh has way better down low game than Amare.|`|3bqvXD6Xaa	Chicago is already Bosh's first choice in free agency, and the Bulls will have the money(only 25 million in contracts for 2010).

iWcTmuhAaa	Rob Van Dam<br>  followed by Kurt Angle, maybe the best wrestler in sports entertainment today.<br>  <br>  Hulk Hogan was the biggest name ever in the wrestling history, not cause he was the best wrestler but just cause he is someone who know who to entertain people and who to gt money out of their pocket book. So he made money for the business and this business made him in return.<br>  <br>  Hulk surely was one of the most charismatic wrestlers of all the times, but I really like real wrestling over all this drama so I will go with my personal favorite Rob Van Dam.|`|qbEeecndaa	hogan|`|U5q7k3Geaa	RVD would eat Hogan|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Hogan would kill him|`|iSIZMz2maa	That would be a very strange match.

hyLnJibTaa	I think your body weight is just find when I was 12 I weighed 115lb and I was like 5'5 and I looked good so I  imagine you look good to. You most likely are skinny but you do not think so because you compare yourself to others and you put them on a higher scale. I am like that to I always think people are skinnier than they are because they are so much better that I am in my eyes. Ok so you want I guy who likes you for you. I know you are tired of hearing that but it is true. The guys you are their can not say anything because some of them are going to be out of shape too. Maybe go with a tankini swim suit they are cutie and they make your body look good at least I think so. Here is a like to some tankinis <a href="http://www.swimoutlet.com/Fashion_Tankinis_s/558.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swimoutlet.com/Fashion_Tankin...</a><br>  I used to never like to wear swim suites or wear my hair in a pony tail and now I wear a swim suit and pony tail form my job. You just have to get comfortable with your body and know that every one else is thinking the same thing about their body. I hoped this helped you! Have fun swimming! You should go it will be fun to hang out with your friends. :)|`|K6R8VO6baa	You really don't have to be worried about this. <br>  1) You're 12<br>  2) You're the perfect weight and height<br>  Don't think of your friend's bodies, think of you and who you are. God made you for who you are and not who your friends are. And if the guys/girls at the party do make fun of your body because it's not perfect, just tell them "God made me for who I am, and I like myself that way." You don't have to say it the exact way I worded it but something along that line. Hope this makes you feel better. :)|`|jwcer2Svaa	don`t worry about it you could<br>  <br>  a. not go to the party<br>  b. wear a one piece<br>  <br>  or c.<br>  have fun and mingle there.

KkZE2NDYaa	Hello again, Adam. Early spring bass are moving around and hard to predict, but the biggest bass tend to be caught this time of year. Look for the water that warms up first in the shallows near drop-offs or creek channels. Farm ponds are good this time of year because they warm up faster. If you don't have access to ponds, the north shores of lakes catch more sunshine and tend to warm up faster. Areas with dark colored bottoms also tend to warm up faster. Bass migrate here first because they are looking to get warmer and this is where the food is. When fishing the cold waters of early spring remember to work your lures slowly. When it is starting to try your patience try slower yet. I like suspending jerk baits worked with long pauses in between this time of year but yum dingers might be good too. just remember to pause between slow bottom bounces and watch for hits as the lure is dropping. Refer back to your other question to what I said about checking magazines for info. Good luck. See you at the lake or creek.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	I'll tell you what, springtime when the water temperature just reaches 50 degrees (F) go for any kind of suspending jerkbait.  They just can't resist.|`|i58nZ79taa	Early spring is prime time for catching giant largemouths and smallmouths alike, but you must have the right tools for the task. Here are a few recommendations for this time of year (full disclosure, I work for PRADCO Outdoor Brands who own Lurenet.com)...<br>  <br>  1) Smithwick 5 ?-inch Suspending Rattlin’ Rogue – Clown<br>  <br>  The suspending jerkbait that put suspending jerkbaits on the map, a Rogue is the bait of choice for giant smallies when they stage just off spawning flats. Pause it as long as you can stand between jerks – and maybe a little longer – and remain ready.<br>  <br>  2) 7-inch YUM Dinger - Watermelon Pearl Laminate<br>  <br>  Big, bold offerings often trigger heavyweight spawning fish into committing, and nothing will do that job quite like a 7-inch YUM Dinger. Big Dingers’ also produce hoards of hawgs when pitched around shallow cover throughout the spring. <br>  <br>  3) BOOYAH 3/4-ounce Football Jigheads – Brown<br>  <br>  During early spring many big fish remain in or very near their winter areas, which dictates hitting deeper structure. A BOOYAH Football Head allows you to keep soft-plastic offerings close to prime structure and comes equipped with a 4/O Gamakatsu hook for putting those big fish in the boat.<br>  <br>  4) YUM 5-inch Gonzo Grub - Green Pumpkin/Orange Flake<br>  <br>  A perfect match for the Football Jighead, a Gonzo Grub has a fluttering skirt and twin tails that provide an incredible amount of action. The 5-inch Gonzo provides the necessary bulk to get a lunker to commit. <br>  <br>  5) Bomber Fat Free Shad - Dance’s Citrus Shad<br>  <br>  If you ever travel to Mexico without a stock of Fat Free Shads you’ll buy some before the trip is over, and if you fish anywhere bass grow big without ‘em, you’re leaving something significant on the table. Fat Frees dig deep to get down among ‘em and have just the right profile and wag.<br>  <br>  6) 1-ounce Double Willow BOOYAH Blade - White Chartreuse<br>  <br>  Another trophy bass gem for when the lunkers are laying low in the water column, a big Double Willow BOOYAH Blade offers a large profile to suggest a serious meal. Let it fall to the bottom and slow roll it across the deepest edges of flats and the ends of points<br>  <br>  7) ?-ounce Single Colorado BOOYAH Blade – Coleslaw<br>  <br>  When early-spring storms stain big bass waters, it’s time to pull out a thumping single Colorado. The fish will move tight to shallow cover, and they will dart out of bush to ambush something that’s creating big vibes. Work close and make short accurate casts, working the bait tight to the thick stuff.<br>  <br>  8) BOMBER Deep Flat A - Apple Red Crawfish<br>  <br>  The Flat A’s extra-tight wiggle suggests an easy meal, which is something bass cannot resist while their metabolism levels remain low. Use a steady medium-slow retrieve and kick it off rocks and the bottom whenever possible.<br>  <br>  9) Cotton Cordell Super Spot - Tomato Red<br>  <br>  A first-season classic on grass lakes, the Tomato Red Super Spot accounts for a tremendous amount of hawgs this time of year. Let it fall into patches of submerged vegetation, rip it out of the grass and hold on tight!|`|tZPOSvHQaa	Live bait is simply the best, indian's always used live bait.<br>  if the fish had a choice they would say live bait!<br>  <br>  the military all around the world use live bait<br>  <br>  I have fished for years and nothing beats the old fashion worm my grandpa showed me <br>  just look under rocks.<br>  <br>  don't try the green smashed up walnut trick it don't work and supposed to be illegal I tried it and didn't get any results<br>  <br>  stick to live worms works great!|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Plastic worms, small grubs, jigs, and lizards.<br>  <br>  I hate to admit it, but I've taken big females off their nests by dragging the above plastics through.|`|lECmz3SEaa	crayfish|`|datmqg7Aaa	Try plastic lizards all you have to do is pull it though the water and give it an occasional jerk or try minnows.But the best thing to do is find out what the fish like.
2lakZBgiaa	well, around where i live, the BEST thing for largemouth bass is the sinko. me and friend chris discovered this bait a long time ago and we've been using it for years. and it never fails! its like a 5 to 6 inch worm like grub, and it gets thick in the middle and kinda thins out towards the ends. what you do is you hook your hook right through the middle of it so the its hanging kinda like an upside down U. then you cast out to a little farther to where your expecting there's bass so the bass see it comin then it passes by them and that's usually when they bite! oh yeah, haha what you do when you cast it is, let it sink close to the bottom, then give it three little jerks, so its at the bottom then up, up, up... let it sink again, then three little jerks again. keep doing that, trust me, it works great!|`|tZPOSvHQaa	Live bait is simply the best, indian's always used live bait.<br>  if the fish had a choice they would say live bait!<br>  <br>  the military all around the world use live bait<br>  <br>  I have fished for years and nothing beats the old fashion worm my grandpa showed me <br>  just look under rocks.<br>  <br>  don't try the green smashed up walnut trick it don't work and supposed to be illegal I tried it and didn't get any results<br>  <br>  stick to live worms works great!|`|xApAWlshaa	I guess you can use large minnowa i like extra large for those big daddy fish.but yeah thats aall i use.and i catch quite a bit|`|KbxPl1oYaa	I love the Berkley Gulp baits... there's such a variety for any situation... and they're money.|`|1nJFqRceaa	you cant beat the everyday common rubber worm.  now not just one particular worm, it all depends on the clarity of the water and other things of that nature so keep you a viarity of colors and dont just limit your self to worms.  i love fishin lizards as well.  i like fishin them with out weight and sliding them over lillys and other structures.  i keep red shad, white, and pumpkin seed colors.  man i hope that helps you out a bit good luck good fishin be safe and remember to share the experience|`|JAMF9wjlaa	really almost any bait is good.  my dad caught about a 6 pound bass with wax worms.  all you need to do is keep your pole moving because  bass like things that move.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	If I only had one artificial lure in my tackle, it would be a jig type because of their versatility. Sometimes fish just don't bite no matter what you use. I saw your other question so maybe we can cover it, too. It's not always the lure you use but where the fish are at the time and the presentation. If you find one lure that works all the time let me know and we will both get rich. Try reading magazines because there is too much information out there to cover here. Just don't believe all the advertisements. Stick to the articles and what they are telling you about water temp. clarity. time of year, structure and presentation, etc. There is a lot of knowledge available, you just need to sort it all out. Good luck. See you on the water.|`|933YqFLNaa	depends on what you want live bait or artificial.  Personally, I like various types/colors of worms, when they aren't working I switch to diving lures.  Best bait though has to be shiners...

Plus they could free up the salary.<br>  <br>  Don't know how much truth there is to that but I know that was the consensus of everyone on the Panel.|`|7utvegsmaa	They didn't get garbage players back I think Phoenix stands a BETTER shot at getting in the playoffs now.
xQFWjFyZaa	I think you should start getting the money now, through Paypal. Don't hold the draft until everyone pays, and kick them out if they don't by a certain date. If you hold the draft without having the money, and some dude drafts a crappy team, there's no way you're getting his money. <br>  <br>  Get it up front, and then enjoy the league.

If you look also, many of the great quarterbacks in football were also pitchers.  Marino, Elway, etc.<br>  <br>  Are you saying that baseball is the only drug infested sport.  Coming from a football fan, that is funny.  Drugs have been linked to everysport, including Golf and Tennis.  And as far as the fitness, you are making a huge generalization of saying these guys have bellies.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	How can you say baseball has no athletic capabilities. Baseball is the hardest sport to actually succeed it. Baseball requires just like any other sport explosive first - step power, bat speed, reaction speed and leg and arm power. Not many players even make it to the pro's. <br>  <br>  Lets see you try and hit a 97 mph fastball or Breaking curveball 450 feet with a thin wooded bat. Its much harder than shooting a basketball in a hoop, where today in the NBA players dont play defense, its all about whoever scores the most points is the best player. When Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan were playing basketball was a team sport now the NBA is a joke. I belive football is tough but its easier to catch a football than hit a baseball.|`|p3tVyimaaa	Baseball may not be your cup of tea sir. However, stating, "But if you're someone like me, who likes to see warriors test it out ands push themselves.

Its obviously not as physical as fball or bball but it takes alot more skill to hit a 90-100 mph fastball that is usually tailing away from you then to throw or run a TD<br>  <br>  That is coming from a football fan with the utmost rrespect for football, but its just that hard to do because of the great skill it requires.<br>  <br>  If you hit .300 you are a very good ball player in the game. so if you fail 7/10 times you are VERY good. Thats how hard baseball is to play skill wise, not athleticly wise.

OWIiJMLqaa	Really I love Flash as much as anybody, he is a top tier player no question, but Lebron sits alone a top the mountain of NBA talent. Kobe is just a peg below that D-wade is right below them with the likes of Howard and Chris Paul, then just below that you have the guys that win championships like Ray Allen and Paul Pierce. Flash is an awesome superstar, he plays at a high level every night, but he simply doesn't have the next level skills that Kobe or Lebron have.  The X factor that makes 50+ pt games common for them. He just doesn't make it look easy when he takes over a game the way the other two do.|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	Wade is insane, and truly one of the best players to watch. <br>  <br>  while I love Wade, I think LeBron is a better player when you look at the smaller details. LBJ isn't as injury prone, made it to the finals without a megastar like Shaquille O'Neal, and the way he approaches the game, he could have a knee or ankle issue and come back and still be very good without full mobility, where Wade heavily relies on his speed to get to the rim or hustle open for jumpers. <br>  <br>  long term, it's LBJ. but today, they're neck and neck in what they do for their teams. LeBron just has the better team at the moment. Pat Riley shouldn't have wussed out and drafted OJ Mayo like Wade wanted, then they'd be in business with JO in the middle.|`|6HwcJDbiaa	Great question, thanks for asking it.<br>  <br>  I think there are several reasons, and here is why:<br>  <br>  1. Converse- Dwyane Wade is sponsored by Converse whereas Lebron and Kobe are Nike athletes. (Ironically Converse is technically owned by Nike, but it operates as its own company.) Because Dwyane Wade is a Converse athlete he just does not get the kind of commercial exposure that Kobe and Lebron get. The T-Mobile spots help, but they are nothing like the Lebron and Kobe commercials as far as building a good basketball image. As far as perception goes, having a good sponsor can go a long way. If Wade had better commercials for shoes, he may get more credit as a basketball player.<br>  <br>  2. Cities- Lebron plays in Ohio, near Indiana, perhaps the craziest basketball state in the US, there is a reason why Hoosiers are talked about so much. Playing in basketball country helps. By playing in Cleveland Lebron gets a lot of coverage and the local reporters are knowledgeable about basketball. Kobe plays in LA, which is the second largest media market after New York. Wade plays in Miami, which historically is not a big basketball town. Although their attendance numbers are good, their stadium is pretty empty when bad teams are in town. Compare that to some place like NY where they sellout even when both teams that are playing are bad.<br>  <br>  3. Height - Dwyane Wade is a few inches shorter than both Lebron and Kobe. Although he is an incredible athlete and is capable of amazing dunks, people seem to not respect little guys as much. Isiah Thomas quite often never got the respect he deserved. <br>  <br>  4. Three point shooting- Kobe shoots a lot of threes, Wade does not shoot nearly as much. For comparison in 05-06 Kobe shot 518 three pointers, Wade shot 77. Yes, that's right Kobe shot 500 and Wade shot 80. People like three pointers, but Wade earns his points the hard way. <br>  <br>  Chuck Daly once said of Isiah Thomas: "He is five inches away from being the greatest player ever." I think you could say that Dwyane Wade is three inches away from being the best player in the NBA. <br>  <br>  Dwyane Wade a Kobe have one thing in common, they both have won a championship with Shaq, and neither has won without Shaq. But Dwyane Wade was the Finals MVP, Kobe never did that. Lebron made it to the Finals, but he lost pretty badly. <br>  <br>  I think D-Wade is the best player out of the three, but I know a lot of people would not agree with you and I. :)|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	to answer your question:<br>  BECAUSE HE IS NOT!!!!!<br>  look at the other night.Who scored more??????LEBRON!!!!!<br>  LeBron rebounds,scores,AND passes more than Wade.<br>  LeBron is the best all-around player in the NBA.<br>  F A C T !|`|N3AiQRJFaa	People do recognize that D-Wade is good, he is right up there with Kobe and LeBron, but his team is not that good.|`|AA10937834	wade is better in points, steals, blocks, assists, minutes. they are basically the same in fg% and ft%|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I am not sure they just think that LeBron has a better overall game then Wade.|`|BntHQeWMaa	they are both still very young, and only will get bother.  at least the nba has some great young talent for the next several years|`|7bx2XQlqaa	Its only because Wade plays on such a bad team.  If his team were in contention for a title this season then Im sure everyone would be putting Wade into the same category as Kobe and Lebron.  In my opinion, we should be giving Wade more credit.  He's unbelievable this season.  He is really making a case for himself as far as MVP goes.  Right now I'd say it couldn't get any closer as far as the MVP race with Lebron Wade and Kobe.  <br>  <br>  If I had to choose I'd say it goes as follows, as of today.<br>  <br>  1. LeBron<br>  2. Kobe<br>  3. Wade<br>  <br>  But this can change a hundred different times before the season ends.  If the Heat make a push and finish strong, like a 3 or 4 seed then I would give it to Wade.|`|eylGsoUeaa	In the last few years, Dwayne wade has gotten injuries and his team took a huge fall as a result. But now he's back to one hundred percent, but because of his previous injury people still ignore what he's done.

He's the face of the game right now and while he often gets too much attention, he's still the former high school high-flying phenom that takes his team to the playoffs and has triple-doubles almost every night. As tight as D-Wade is, he probably won't get the respect he deserves until he takes his team back to the SHIP.|`|bTPiW2iAaa	He gets hurt to much<br>  Kobe is more experienced and won more championships<br>  Lebron makes people around him better if u want proof think about how lebron took his team to the finals without any other big names on the team where as the heat sucked last year when wade was in that position<br>  Lebron is a freak of a man<br>  Lebron can literally play every position on the court<br>  And lebron and Kobe just have a bigger fan base|`|iGNRnGwdaa	Since Dwade is NEVER healthy thats a pretty big downfall... Lebron is also a physical FREAK with his built in shoulder pads for shoulders... LeBron and Kobe also have an uncanny aura about them that when one of them steps on the court they're the man and everyone around them gets better. Dwade has that but not as much as Kobe + Bron|`|b5ee51da3a720189de576c83c7640e82aa	Because if right now Lebron and D-wade we're traded... Miami would be going to the finals and cleveland would suck again. I could almost guarantee it... Lebron with D-wade's supporting cast could def win a title this year.<br>  <br>  D-wade can score, that's for sure. However, he doesn't have the ability to take over every aspect of the game like lebron.|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Okay. Last year when LeBron didn't have any back up he averaged 30 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists which is better than what D-Wade averages with a crappy team. Now that LeBron has a great team he still has better all around stats, along with a 45-12 record.|`|znGln0VUaa	because most sports analyst and sports writers don't look at individual performances that much. i think if the Heat was at least number 5 in the eastern conference then D-wade would get way more recognition for how good of a player he is.|`|xMJXJPrDaa	In my opinion he is playing better than Kobe and Lebron. (Kobe Fan) He is trying to take games on his own but also seeks help. He is doing a better job than Kobe when Kobe was scoring 40+ pts and was 8th seed in WC.|`|OnpLn838aa	Cool.

2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	yes. Paul is the prototypical point guard, there isn't a team in the NBA that wouldn't bench their starting PG for him, and would trade anyone on their roster unless their names were LeBron, Kobe or Duncan. <br>  <br>  AI is a great scorer, not a great winner. Paul is going to retire with multiple MVP's and championships. he can make average guys like Tyson Chandler and David West allstar calibur players. imagine what happens if he's ever on a team with another elite player?|`|ST6O0oXsaa	Yes now he is. <br>  Paul doesn't however possess the ability to score like Iverson once did. I doubt he ever will either. Nothing against him I just find his 3 point shot to be a little streaky. If they were both in their primes I would have to go with Paul. He makes players better around him. Look at Rasual Butler and Tyson Chandler. They were nobodies. David West was going to be a good shooter regardless of Paul, but nobody expected it to happen this soon. And look at Peja! It looked like his career was over when he was on the Pacers. Paul revived his career.<br>  Iverson never had that ability.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	as of right now cp3 is better than AI,simply put<br>  both in their primes however AI was much better<br>  right now if i have to start a franchise i would take cp3 if it means AI isnt in his prime,but if both are in their youth or prime i would definatley take AI,back then this guy was a great package|`|YYUWqbC7aa	at this point yes....in their respective primes, personally i think all around iverson is....but chris paul hasn't peaked just yet|`|CHdQqxM4aa	he is better and it is easier to build a franchise around cp3 bcoz iverson isnt a team playr|`|BntHQeWMaa	at the moment, paul is better.. career wise AI is a first ballot HOF... paul has a while|`|sj8EM9ejaa	chris Paul is better now but iverson back then was better ,Iverson's prime has past|`|C4mzZwiWaa	in their prime no<br>  <br>  right now yes|`|mCxhX9tMaa	Yes, Chris Paul is a better player than Allan Iverson.  Yes, Iverson can put up the points.  He is an incredible player at the offensive end.  But he is also a volume shooter.  He has to have the ball in his hands to affect the game.<br>  <br>  Chris Paul, on-the-other-hand, while he can put up big numbers, also makes everyone around him better.  He runs the offense and distributes the ball.  He leads the league in assists, averaging 11 per game.  He also plays great defense, leading the league in steals as well.<br>  <br>  Even if they were both in their prime, Chris Paul would be the guy to build a franchise around, not Iverson.  Given the age difference, it is even more lopsided.  Chris Paul is the man.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Chis Paul and Allen Iverson have two completely different approaches to the game. Chris Paul is a great ball handler, he can pass with the best of them and he can score (he's just not really a scorer). Allen Iverson on the other hand is a pure scorer, he doesn't share the ball much and his game revolves around creating shots for himself. Chris Paul can control the tempo of a game, AI can only react to the other teams play and often fails to do enough to get the win(now that he's older). So, Paul is the better passer, ball handler and overall team catalyst but AI is the better scorer. I would rather build my franchise around Paul because he knows what is necessary for his team to win (team-work) and he'll do what it takes to win. AI thinks what the team needs for them to win is for him to score, which is why he has no championships and very few playoff seasons.|`|7bx2XQlqaa	of course he is, its not even close.  Chris Paul has established himself as the BEST PG in the game.  AI is on the decline.<br>  <br>  Paul would be my choice to start a franchise over AI.  HE's younger, he makes his teamates better, he's a better passer, and AI has never won a championship and never will.  Paul hasn't won one yet either, but he's got a lot more play left in him and I bet he will get a couple rings.|`|HVzVzXsnaa	In their primes, I'd take Iverson. He was the most dominant little man to ever play the game and, in my opinion, the best pure scorer of all-time. And all of this "he's not a team player" garbage is exactly that; garbage. The guy consistently put up solid assist numbers and would run through a brick wall to win games; the guy played through TONS of injuries throughout his career and was still able to take over games.|`|IeLBIACaaa	chris paul is better now.  Iverson is getting old, hes been in the leage for a long time.  <br>  Career wise it would be difficult for chirs paul to be what iverson has been unless he stays healthy for alot of seasons.  <br>  A good point gaurd thats storming up through the ranks is Rajon Rondo of the Celtics.  <br>  Chris Paul is doing the most for his team right now tho.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	right now yes.<br>  In their primes,Iverson is better.<br>  just as many assists,more points(2-3 scoring titles in Iversons career).<br>  if Paul can get a ring or more,he might be better at the end of his career.<br>  But if Iverson happens to get a ring before he retires,he will be better!|`|xMJXJPrDaa	two different kind of point guards can't compare.<br>  <br>  Crunch time id go with iverson, if i want to create offense for a player paul|`|HuQVHaIgaa	Hahaha now hell yeah but at their primes Iverson was a monster|`|tgZXvSv2aa	At the moment yes, and at this rate he will also have a better career.|`|vUGKu877aa	yes|`|21J0IIZbaa	Currently Paul is better than Iverson.  All-Time Iverson is better.|`|PPFonRYdaa	Obviously Chris Paul right now. Iverson is old and way past his prime. Chris Paul is a pure point guard who can distribute the ball. Iverson is just a scorer.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Lebron James|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Yes, and I would rather have Chris Paul|`|k2AmQylBaa	chris paul is wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better right now, career wise i would say AI|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dwyane Wade

DOVbF4Piaa	For street riding and hard packed trails like rail trails and bike paths I would go with a hybrid with 700 x 28-32c tires or a comfort/pathway bike with 26'' tires.  If you do more street riding lean toward the hybrid and for trail riding go with the pathway bike.  There is only one manufacturer that I would recommend that has bikes under $300 and that is Forge.  Here are some examples.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forgebikes.com/mstreetblu.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgebikes.com/mstreetblu.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.forgebikes.com/athenam.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgebikes.com/athenam.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.forgebikes.com/devontrail.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgebikes.com/devontrail.asp</a><br>  <br>  I have the men's version of the Devon and it's a great bike for the money.  They only problem is that these bikes must be mail ordered and assembled by you or someone that knows what they are doing.  You could have a bike shop assemble the bike or check your work and tune it for you.<br>  <br>  You can add another $100 and get a quality bike from a shop. Never buy a Walmart or any department/sports store bike, they are poor quality and not assembled correctly.|`|z1Ury9XNaa	Craigslist is the best deal for a bike. I'd look for a Commuter bike that is 3-4 years old. Specialized, Trek, Haro, Giant, are all good brands. Also you might look into getting a single speed if it's just for flat city riding.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	one that someone else hasn't owned!|`|WAGpAh8oaa	look at the specialized hard rock. at my local dealer its 320|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Up your budget to $350, go to your local bike shop, and tell them you want a hybrid. It'll do city streets and light trails just fine. Try several on for proper fit. <br>  <br>  If that's too much, shop garage sales, craigslist, but only after you've visited the bike shops and gotten a good idea of what you're after. Fit and decent components are the important points.<br>  <br>  Avoid the box stores. Poor components, questionable assembly, no backup.

ubGNtkHQaa	I disagree on two things:<br>  <br>  1. The NFC east will have much more wins.<br>  <br>  2. The Lions will go 0-16 again|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Don't agree with your Bengals prediction. They will be much better. Last season they had to 12 ranked defense and they were young and will get better. T.J. is gone, but they just signed Lavernneus Coles to replace him. Carson Palmer is healty and Chad Johnson is too. They brought back Cedric Benson resigned and he was good last season. They will be a wildcard team.|`|uwx7etCXaa	I find your NFC predictions more interesting, so I will comment on the NFC only.  <br>  <br>  Packers, Falcons, and Cardinals will not win more than 10 games.  Cowboys, Giants, Panthers, Bears, Saints and Seahawks will win more than 10 games.  Lions?  0-16 to 4-12, seems like you're way over your head, but I like that...but you're wrong...they will be somewhere between 5-11 or 7-9.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	I hate the Cowboys with a passion, and even I know that they aren't that bad. I certainly hope your right.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Bills at 4-12?<br>  <br>  People need to stop underestimating my team.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	not too good|`|CmRH29zgaa	Well, besides it being way too early to make predictions ...<br>  <br>  And besides disagreeing with several of your picks (Cardinals won't win 12, Packers won't win 11, Bucs won't lose 11, etc., in my opinion)<br>  <br>  Your wins and losses don't equal - you've got something like 18 more losses than wins.<br>  <br>  Interesting discussion question, though, I guess.|`|J76jjgsaaa	Well first of all I think it's too early to make predictions considering that the draft hasn't even came yet. I mean what if the Lions draft Stafford and he ends up being like Matt Ryan or something. And I think that the as huge as a loss losing Haynesworth was, its not gonna give them 5 more losses than they had last year considering they just picked up what they desperatley needed in a WR that can stretch the field.|`|msxGICJvaa	okay you go some wrong stuff here steelers will be a least 15-1 or 14-2 and the lion will go 13-3 after the L. Curse end the curse was that the lion will not win any for 50 years now it have been 50 years later.|`|VjJJSvxnaa	chiefs will win division. vikings will win division. saints will win division. cowboys will win division BENGALS (not bengles) will not go 2 and 12. did you just pull this ish out of your funhole?|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Good... Except you are underestimating the Panthers, Vikings and Jets. Also, Dallas can't be THAT bad!|`|63PdLNMQaa	good your not underestamating the texans unlike other haters<br>  Coach Future: yes are defense made moves, we signed DE antonio smith|`|AOA8TJraaa	It's good|`|N8wNmQShaa	No offense to you, but your predictions are way off.<br>  <br>  First off, how do you put the Chiefs at 7-9 when they lost a good coach in Herm Edwards, got a NEW coach... and traded for a NEW QB in Cassel.. who didnt even start in college, and only has played started 15 games as a professional... even if he is an upgrade, Cassel is NO superstar, the Chiefs problems go way beyond QB... they need another WR, their HB wants out, their best lineman wants out, their TE wants out, and their Defense is awful. Having a New coach, new QB, and a new GM will not help things out much this year. Chiefs will go 5-11.<br>  <br>  Sticking with the AFC West, how do you put the Raiders at 3-13? They went 5-11 last year, they are returning their coach, last year was basically Russels first year...  Their defense is great, they upgraded their line... and their in a very weak division. They have a very solid run game... and one of the best special teams. Will they win the Superbowl?? No... but only winning 3 games is ridiculous, they will win atleast 6... but I will say the Raiders go 7-9.<br>  <br>  The Broncos at 8-8 is fair, they have a good offense even though the new coach and gm put Jay Cutler in a awkward position, their defense is still horrible... they go 6-10 - 8-8.<br>  <br>  There is no way the Texans can win 9 games while being in a division with 3 teams that are far better than them. Texans lack the defensive explosion, they didnt make any big moves AT ALL. They only have 1 running back, and their QB is prone to Injuries. They need a 2nd WR... and their division is just overall to strong. Texans go 8-8 at the most.<br>  <br>  Titans finished 13-3 last year, and resigned a LOT of their players. Yes they lost Albert Haynesworth, but do you really think Jeff Fisher will let the Titans go 8-8 after they lead the NFL in wins? I dont think so. Titans go 10-6.<br>  <br>  The Steelers went 12-4 last year with the HARDEST schedule in the NFL, they didnt lose anyone significant, and their coach has yet another year of experience. Why on earth do you think they will lose more games with an easyer schedule? Thats obsurd. Steelers go 14-2. MAYBE 13-3.<br>  <br>  Ravens made it to the AFC Championship, yes they lost Bart but is that enough to knock them out of the Playoffs when they go against the Browns and Bengals a combined 4 times during a year? Are you forgetting they still have a very good run game, and their QB wont be a rookie anymore... Ravens go 9-7 or 10-6.<br>  <br>  Patriots going 13-3?? Is this a joke? Their defense is extremely old, they had horrible numbers on the defensive side last year, their offense is still great... BUT Tom Brady hasnt played in a very long time, and their is a LOT of concerns about him not even being ready to play come regular season time. The Patriots will go 10-6, even if Tom is back to himself they wont go past 11 wins.<br>  <br>  Bills going 4-12? Are you crazy... they started off 4-0 last year... they will win more games than 4. Bills go 7-9<br>  <br>  Green Bay 11-5? Your funny kid... they only won 6 games this last year, and they are in a horrible defensive position. They lost all chances of getting good D lineman, and they even lost some lineman from their team. They are in a bad situation... because they cannot stop the run. Not to mention, they have no running back... and AAron Rogers won only 6 games.<br>  <br>  Vikings 9-7? They have a great running game, a great run stopping defense, and a good special teams... in a weak division and you say they will only win 7 games? You do know they traded for Sage Rosenfels (excuse the spelling)... Vikings go 11-5.<br>  <br>  Bears 8-8<br>  Lions 3-13<br>  <br>  Falcons 12-4? You cannot be serious... in a division with the Saints, Panthers, and Buccs... and you say the Falcons go 12-4 with a Sophomore QB and a Sophomore coach... while not signing anyone worth mentioning in the off season. You are nuts... Falcons have a good run game, and for this... they go 9-7. They are an ok team, but they wont take anyone by surprise. Their divison is just to strong.<br>  <br>  Panthers went 12-4 this last year, how can you say they will go from 12-4 to a losing season without losing anyone good? <br>  Panthers go 10-6<br>  Buccaneers go 10-6<br>  <br>  Their is no way the Eagles will have more wins than last year, by losing their best defensive player... and losing their back up half back... and possibly losing McNabb... while at the same time, the Redskins make up a lot of ground, the Giants reload their defense, and the Cowboys still are the Cowboys. Eagles will go 6-10 - 7-9.<br>  <br>  Redskins could win 10 games. No more though, the division is to strong.<br>  <br>  Giants will go 11-5 if they have Burress back...<br>  <br>  Cowboys 11-5<br>  <br>  You do know Cardinals went 9-7 last year right? And they might lose Boldin... and they already lost their offensive Coordinator... saying they will win 12 games is wrong. They most likely win 10, possibly 11... if they give some breaks.<br>  <br>  Seahawks will win 10 games this year, they are stacked at WR, have a good QB with a good RB... good Pass rush...|`|Tgnia0bwaa	You have the Browns winning 5 games....LOL! I'm from cleveland there aint no way they will win 3! Browns have NFC north this year they might beat DET  I think TB will do a bit better.NFC east is tuff. Lions winning 4 lmao I hope that they do, could you see them going 0-32! that would be nutz. I'm glad to see that football season never ends.. Take care!|`|s9IO0g7Xaa	not sure i agree with nfc north.. Packers are still too young.. I find it interesting that you have the cowboys at 6-10.. if they release T.O then that could be correct, if not I'd give them 8-8.. I really like all your other picks EXCEPT the Bucs.. probable 9-7|`|LmFVTUkHaa	I think you did pretty good till the,nfc west,cards are not going to be that good again,pitt will be as good,and the niners will be better the 6-10 maybe win the nfc west.|`|YKhulh5Haa	WTF why does everyone think the Bills suck and Tom Brady is not going to be the same QB. The AFC East better watch out for the BILLS. LETS GO BUFFALO!!!!!|`|HX6eNw6daa	Lions at 4-12....<br>  <br>  People need to stop over estimating my team.... lol just kidding the whole thing looks pretty good in Predictions!|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	Well don't completely agree with you but the hippos didn't get away this time. Not too shabby|`|paIUgtLRaa	AFC West:<br>  SD: 9-7 (by default. No one wants this division)<br>  DEN: 8-8 (new coach, same problems)<br>  OAK: 6-10 (Russell is a bust. McFadden is great, but not enough)<br>  KC: 4-12 (should improve, but way too much is needed)<br>  <br>  AFC South:<br>  IND: 12-4 (by default, on Texans will challenge, but won't be one)<br>  HOU: 9-7 (2 straight years of 8-8 will prove beneficial)<br>  TEN: 7-9 (Collins another year older, Haynesworth gone, Young waiting)<br>  JAX: 6-10 (Is Jack Del Rio done in Jacksonville?)<br>  <br>  AFC North:<br>  PIT: 13-3 (almost same team as last year, last years schedule was much harder, compared to the cupcake this year, but success may go to their head)<br>  BAL: 10-6 (Improvements on offense negated by the further aging and dismantling of the D)<br>  CIN: 5-11 (Does anyone really think Coles is a adequate replacement for T.J.? On any other team, Lewis would have been fired by now)<br>  CLE: 3-13 (Letting go talent players and not replacing them isn't smart. Mangini will be wise and take notes from previous CLE coaches)<br>  <br>  AFC East:<br>  NE: 12-4 (Brady shows its his team but offense pieces that were there from 2007 but now missing hurts. Defense is Achilles Heel.)<br>  MIA: 10-6 (Can't keep up momentum and lose the surprise factor. Wildcard is exploited, washed up, and done.)<br>  NYJ: 6-10 (Ryan's first year didn't go as planned. Defense is one of the best, but offense is the concrete shoes to this corpse of a franchise)<br>  BUF: 6-10 (Years of mediocre drafts and underachieving leaves this team a mess. Edwards still shows flashes but that's all they are.)<br>  <br>  NFC West:<br>  ARI: 11-5 (If Boldin stays, this is achievable. Defense continues performance from last year)<br>  SF: 10-6 (possible wildcard pick. Singletary has them playing lots better. If Arizona stumbles, or Boldin doesn't play, SF takes the division)<br>  SEA: 6-10 (Mora luck doesn't come to SEA. No playoff berth here. T. J. not enough to plug all of the holes.<br>  STL: 6-10 (Spagnuolo has them playing. Potential quality draft picks has this team eyeing the future, success won't come overnight)<br>  <br>  NFC South:<br>  NO: 10-6 (If defense improves, this is where they end up.)<br>  ATL: 10-6 (Ryan matures, coach should draft defensively)<br>  CAR: 9-7 (After a year of overachieving the CAR faces reality. Running game will be as strong as ever. Delhomme gets yet another year older)<br>  TB: 5-11 (Purging as many veterans as they did doesn't come without a price. Excellent chance for younger players to get a shot for some game experience. Shouldn't stay down for too long)<br>  <br>  NFC North:<br>  MIN: 11-5 (Softer division should help. With a quarterback pickup, 11-5 is highly achievable. Behind Jackson, who will be benched again, they will do fine, unless Jackson, Childress, both get cut/fired respectively)<br>  GB: 7-9 (Going from a 4-3 to a 3-4 without proper pesonnel will cost them. Rogers will play fine, but defense will take some time to adjust.<br>  CHI: 7-9 (Orton will be just fine, but defense is crumbling, Riveria will be missed more than anyone knows, Urlacher is one year older, need a replacement soon)<br>  DET: 4-12 (Pieces are already there, Schwartz will have them believing in no time, not going to be competitive for another year or two)<br>  <br>  NFC East:<br>  NYG: 12-4 (Cowboys decline and discontent in Philly will leave the division up to NYG)<br>  PHI: 9-7 (McNabb still does want it, but the losses at D or too much to withstand.)<br>  DAL: 9-7 (Owens gone is a weight lifted off of the team, however, nothing changes: team still can't finish the season, and no one is on the same page)<br>  WAS: 6-10 (Despite another year of spending like there is no tomorrow, Snyder has another high priced loser on his hands. Defense is great, but the team stuggles as a whole (especially against the division they play in), the West Coast isn't for Campbell and he regresses, and Zorn is fired, after only his second year)

Pittsburgh just won the Super Bowl and has a real shot at going back next year. Notice I didn't say "is" going back, or "they will go back", but just a real "shot". Now Washington leaves to collect his millions elsewhere. He goes to the Titans who were good last year, but really, does anyone really believe that they are going anywhere next year. Collins, another year older, Young waiting right behind, really, who thinks this guy isn't just another quarterback bust, and the defense doesn't have Haynesworth. Titans are going down next year.<br>  <br>  If that isn't picking the money over championships, I don't know what is. I guess 2 was enough for Washington. I guess he didn't want a shot at 3.|`|xt4vcVIiaa	No... he just wants to go with a team I guess he thinks could be a contender next year while making more money.<br>  Before you all flip out, carson palmer will be healthy, chad ocho cinco will be good next year, cedric benson's pretty good and they got keith rivers and most likely aaron curry on their defense.<br>  So they'll be alright|`|yqC51KXOaa	I agree completely, but maybe he thought he could be the replacement TJ. who knows, maybe he and palmer will do well together.|`|0TAld46gaa	Money or not who cares<br>  it's there life there business.<br>  <br>  Especially times we are now<br>  money is alot more important|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Nope, the PERFECT example would be Asante Samuel.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yes and no.  I mean yeah, he probably won't win jack in Cincinnati, but hey, was he ever going to win with the Jets?  He's probably used to losing, and not EVERYONE can be on a winning team.  If everyone went to the winning teams then it would be a situation of the rich getting richer.  The good teams would get better and the bad teams would forever be bad.  <br>  <br>  While it may be a case of someone caring more for the money, its good that some of the bad teams get some players to rebuild as well.  Not to mention, nowhere you go you're guarenteed to win a championship.  May as well take the money as you're getting older.  Would you really rather see Coles playing for Pittsburgh or New England or somewhere like that and just make them even better?|`|daRDQE9maa	Not really he wants to play football, period he's a good athelete and loves the game.. and as for examples of players caring more about the mone then winning I can think of 2 guys right now that def care more about winning and not about the money... Larry Fitzgerald and Kurt Warner both of them offered to take pay cuts to keep one of what i beleive is one of the top recievers in the game and thats Aquan Bolden!|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I disagree. I don't know why everyone is hating on the Bengals. They can be good next season. Carson Palmer is a franchise QB and is healthy again. Last season they finished with the 12 ranked defense and they were young. They could have a top ten defense next year. Cedric Benson was productive after he was signed last season. Chad Johnson is healthy. Baltimore willl not be as good because the lost their defensive coordinator and Bartt Scott. They could be a wildcard next year.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Uh, how about Brian Dawkins? The Broncos aren't going anywhere for a while. And Derrick Ward? He went to the BUCS! Wow.
FrZkfexqaa	Well I have been a cheerleader my whole life well since I was 12, I started in 7th grade and went all the way to my senior year,,,,,<br>  <br>        Ya know sweetheart, when you get older the only things we really regret are the things we never tried right?  Think about it,,do you 10 years from now, want to always wonder if you would have made it or not?  This is what life is about, it's about getting in the game and playing in the game,, I spent a lot of years sitting on the side lines and the only regrets I have are the things that I didn't do,,,<br>  <br>        You bet your *** you should do this,,and practice, practice, practice,,,and believe in yourself,,I know I sound corny, but this is what life is about,,,taking chances,,now get out there and show um what ya got, girlfriend,,,Make Me Proud,,,from one Cheerleader to another;)|`|rsFWSelnaa	yes go for it|`|H7D9FiAdaa	Why not?

Were they usable for bait?|`|tnsU5oEnaa	No it would have been on the news the minute they got picked up. Since they werent with they other they are probably dead but the families and friends are holding out hope. It is cold and there are sharks I was kinda suprised the other was found but it was wonderful news on one hand terrible on the other.|`|yDp2hNc5aa	That would be really great if that did happen or to even find them on some kind of island or some place. But as the days pass by, hope is thinning.|`|KbxPl1oYaa	I think it would be great if that's the case... but the one who made it... he said the others kind of gave up.  They let themselves go off the boat or swam for it... in open water in a storm.|`|5ViCDwf0aa	no by now it would be on the news|`|lECmz3SEaa	could be but one was found|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Best possible scenario, but I think the chances of that are mightly slim at this point.|`|bRXuAgCqaa	I heard on the news today they might be slaves on a Chinese fishing boat.

vxMJwivPaa	I just started this past summer for my school team and I absolutely adore the sport. I think it all depends on the person. If you are actually really interested in it then you will love it. But if it's just something to do just for the sake of doing something than I would think a little more before signing up. Some people are naturally more advanced than others and some people take a little extra time to pick up the sport the way that they would like to. It take a lot of dedication and it can at times be very frustrating. When you play a few times though, at practice or just with friends, then you will get used to it and get better. The feel of running for that ball and hitting it hard right over the net is one of the most amazing feelings you will ever experience. An when you have a good volley between you and your opponent it feels ridiculously content, and proud. When you get that point that people didn't expect you to, you feel like you have accomplished something. <br>  I say go for it!<br>  There's really nothing you can lose from trying. <br>  Warning: It can be very tiring though but you should get into shape through practices. Practice outside of tea practices though. You should try to play at least 3 times a week. AT LEAST. Work on your concentration also.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  :]|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	yes!  it's the only sport I know of where it's really just you out there...you're completely in control of what happens on the court and feel a deep sense of connection to the game. It's a great feeling, really, and it exists regardless of how well you play.  Also, it's something that can be played as you get older, and can also be a nice social tool once you're in the business world.|`|LfFdQwcdaa	Yes it is SOOOO much fun!!!! It doesn't take long to become good, it only took me a few days to find out that it was my true sport. You should have good hand-eye coordination though and be able to move pretty fast.|`|5OmY6S1Waa	tennis takes alot of practice, tennis is fun cause the feeling when you hit the ball on center of you raquet, it feels great|`|JnNlD0dFaa	Well, some people are good naturally and some people are just not able to hit a ball. You have to have the right technique mastered to hit the ball well, which takes practice, so if you have a place like Lifetime Fitness that has a tennis court nearby, it would help to sign up so you can practice there. To me it is my favorite sport, and one you can play no matter where you are if you simply have a racket and a ball! I would try out, yeah! And have fun!|`|WueuxAGuaa	Yes, I played last year for my school for the first tim.  I don't really know how long it takes to be good, but right now I am on the #1 doubles team on varsity and like I said I've only been playing about a year.|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	Don't Hesitate!<br>  And send me an autograph in order that if you became great I don't need to come for it!|`|iAIv62HXaa	Tennis is the best sport! Trust me, I've tried them all. Although many think that it requires no skill because the people who play tennis don't exactly have bulging muscles, it really takes a lot of skill to learn. <br>  <br>  Umm...it's fun, but only after you get good at it. In the beginning, you will find tennis very boring. I advise you have a friend teach you basic technique. Once you get past the part where you can't even hit a ball over a net, tennis will feel incredibly enjoyable. <br>  <br>  How long does it take to get good at it? Well, if you play every other day like I did, I'd say a solid five months. However, if you're looking to be #1, you're going to need five years of experience b4 trying out for a major team.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

A bit of pace to go on the left. All we really need is to be more solid away from home. A bit like Villa were being.

qe1Ncf7Yaa	i agree once i said to a farmer playing with his ding dong..(doorbell) that he should go out and play some sports and maybe try skatboarding dso he tried it and came back to my place while i was sleeping the next day and played with my ding dong for 15 mins(doorbell) before i actually woke up but then he said that hes never skateboarding again because when an old lady told him to get off the side walk he hit her over the head with his skateboard and she turned into woner woman and beat the **** out of his ding dong....(doorbell) and then relocated his house to the city so he couldnt make crops anymore than she beat him up with a strawberry and corn stalk.|`|iYniP6hbaa	Well I don't skate, but (as lame as this sounds, I'm trying to get nice abs) I'm always outside with a hula hoop.

1yOdrYiHaa	I Don't think we will ever see Edge Turns Face , I Think Big show Will Turn Face beat Edge on wm to become the Champion and yea there feud will be on after Wreslemania|`|InX5Pfl5aa	It will be a Face Vs Tweener Vs Heel due to cena coming into this match.<br>  <br>  BTW Big Show is more of a tweener right now.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I hope it's Big Show that's turning face, but it's likely Edge. He's been leaning towards being a tweener for awhile now.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Edge. I think Cena knows something is going on with Vickie and Big Show and he uses that against her to get in the match at Wrestlemania then he will tell the world after he is put in the match. Edge dumps Vickie and turns face.<br>  <br>  That's my prediction!|`|dgXKvb7haa	Big Show will eventually go face.Edge could never go face again.|`|310m2T4Daa	Hopefully neither!|`|1JywgkyMaa	neither,they're gonna put cena in the match|`|yL9sgWpZaa	They probably going to have one because Big Show just challenged Edge for the World Heavyweight belt.|`|QbY18bjkaa	yea cena is going to find his way in there

dDKS40Zsaa	Okay, this is just a thought, but aren't there mechanical bulls to practice on?<br>  There are different speeds that allow riders to practice until they feel comfortable to go to a faster speed.<br>  I don't think it a good idea to go with the real thing without experiencing the herky-jerky movements of a mechanical bull. <br>  After all, at 15 you wouldn't want to get messed up this young.<br>  Good luck.

Ry4Jc96Aaa	why can't you do both, their different seasons?<br>  anyway, id say football if you school team is good because of your height. and don't get intimidated by the other guy, if you said your fast and you got skills there is no need to play basketball instead. i can't really tell you to do because you should know which one you enjoy more/ <br>  <br>  would you be on varsity on either team?|`|GiONso7zaa	football, if you're real fast, a short running back is right up your ally.<br>  <br>  you might have a hard time with basketball because of your height. <br>  <br>  And football is so much cooler.|`|zLBDmcsnaa	You can do both they are not in the same season?

Just ask yourself what sport you're better at and what you like better.|`|dsoEpIYRaa	basketball all the way...just make sure your team doesn't go 3-16 like my high school boys varsity team did. our girls basketball team is the best. we are 44-0 over a 3 year period|`|6PGsQzC4aa	basketball is way funner than football!

gm3B6HLNaa	Yes it will, especially if the Oilers coach will use Kotalik as Lindy Ruff should have. You put a guy on the 4th line with players like Mair and Koleta (who I like but aren't the most talented guys around) and you expect Kotalik to be a wizard out there and score at will, move him up in the lineup give him some talent to work with and he will produce. Just look at Buffalo's power play with him out there.|`|YJi66M5Gaa	I hope the change of scenery does him well. He's got talent, he just hasn't put forth the effort. <br>  <br>  Maybe this is an indication that Moreau might be back sooner rather than later. With Pisani back, they still have the grinders. Horcoff is pretty tough on that top line, the second line is looking a little weak. Gagner was beginning to find chemistry with Cole, is Kotalik the right person to put him back on track?<br>  <br>  I'll give this team a shot to get to the postseason this year, second round? Meh don't see it. Penner's future hangs in the balance.|`|koaXBU4uaa	With all the power houses in the west - San Jose, Detroit, Calgary, and Chicago, and maybe even Vancouver... It might have made their team better but not even close to contend with these teams....(toughest teams in the league are in the west)....My team (Anaheim) might not make it through if they even make it to the playoffs|`|rv6zl5t3aa	It doesn't hurt, but then again will it really help?<br>  <br>  Kolatik seems is nothing more than a PP specialist, unless getting more time on the 2nd line will help him, but I doubt it.<br>  <br>  O'Sullivan seems like he has the skills, but just needs to bring it. If not he's no better than Cole.<br>  <br>  Overall, I don't think they hurt or helped themselves.|`|hMo9z0TSaa	I dont think so. Patrick O'Sullivan has skills. Those are his stats. with the Kings.<br>  <br>  GP          G              A                +/-            Pts  <br>  62           14            23                1             37|`|lJ0crTuiaa	we'll see|`|VC5mEULTaa	Kotalik won't, since there are no shootouts in the playoffs.<br>  <br>  okay, I'll add to my answer. Kotalik will help on the PP he's good on the point and has a great shot while really doesn't give up chances shorthanded. He will not help out much 5 on 5. The playoffs have more intensity than the regular season, and unfortunately that is an area Kotalik lacks in. The intensity and pressure to perform goes up, and he is nowhere to be seen. Don't get to see O'Sullivan enough to comment.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	My first response was to say "heck no, they can't beat Calgary, San Jose, or Detroit".<br>  <br>  However, look at recent history...there's a lot of first-round upsets.  If Roloson reverts to 2006 form, they have a puncher's chance.  Detroit has goaltending issues (on paper- maybe Ty Conklin is the answer, or maybe Osgood will come good by the playoffs).  San Jose...they always do the right thing on paper, and yet- it hasn't worked out.  Calgary...okay, they're the big winner today, but their recent playoff form isn't that great.|`|lYnkvRASaa	It improves them, Cole was not doing much.  Does it get them to round 2, I doubt it.  They are looking at facing one of the top seeds if they get in and will be hard pressed to make it to the second round.<br>  <br>  What does this do for Buffalo, essentially Moore for Kotalik, both UFA's.  I don't see a lot of upgrade there.  Moore will not get the same type of ice time in Buffalo as he enjoyed in TO, don't see him producing much more than Kotalik.<br>  <br>  As an aside I just saw a distinguished gentleman in a old hawks jersey and a Fedora downstairs, was it you?<br>  <br>  Edit: The imposter is in Mtl, Place du Canada.

595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	One of my favorites is the night race at Richmond. It doesn't get much better than a saturday night, Nascar and short track racing.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	I like Dover a lot it is the perfect length, width and the cars race and bump and bang.  It is a real fun track.|`|icTRTBAraa	The Daytona night race in July and of course my all time favorite Bristol night race.  I love day races but night races are just so much more exciting.|`|Uaj4B84iaa	Richmond. Nothing better than some short track night racing.|`|vet4adaYaa	I've been to tons of races and I love Vegas for some reason, awesome track and access to other areas is awesome, But I'm also a fan of the superspeedways, I really don't like short tracks. Such a shame to take a 700 horsepower NASCAR and have it drive on some short track. Just my opinion.|`|SzuSqKR0aa	I like Daytona, Atlanta and Talladega and the short tracks Bristol and Martinsville and all the night races rock!!!!|`|y3j27KMYaa	the Glenn without doubts, I know most here want to cancel road courses, but the New York track is amazing, the Bus Stop chicane is huge|`|xGxHkj8faa	Bristol because of all the beating and banging door to door racing.|`|7Xjdv6jRaa	I personally enjoy either of the races held at Bristol or Talladega.  I am sucker for those high banks!|`|cMLJPQpBaa	Darlington...<br>   You gotta be brave and drive her hard|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	thats a really hard question, my favorites are a few of the night short tracks. bristol and darlington are a blast.|`|b7f2a1f896da50f40a80adc987669ea3aa	I like Bristol and Talladega the best. Because I think they're fun to watch!|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	watching races on the tv is great,every weekend,if possible, i am parked in front of the tv.i like to watch the mile 1/2 races on high banks,such as atlanta,lowes..........dont care to much for flat tracks.......have been to talladega and bristol,love those races,as far as i am concerned there are not to many races better than these.<br>  <br>  i go to Ky speedway quite a bit,just cause it is fight down the road.dont think i have ever missed a bush or truck race there,even went to an IRL race,that was fun to see.|`|peY0dwDwaa	The Lady in Black Darlington because the high banking of turn one and two is amazing and my favorite driver Rocket Ryan Newman is very good there.|`|yZUQToOdaa	I enjoy the Infineon track because it has a lot of sharp turns and Jeff Gordon does good on road courses.|`|c16PCaCmaa	I like Dover.  Side by side racing on the high banks!  It's what stock car racing should look like.|`|tGHGloS1aa	talladega. it has i banks that i like|`|C0i3t4graa	I think Talledega and Atlanta.|`|JuUwhegqaa	Bristol and martinsville they are so cool to watch them bump and bang on each other it is like complete hell
VY7jIcAXaa	Since Rose and Jackson are ineligible for the Hall of Fame, I will have to go with Bert Blyleven.  He had an outstanding career, he was a shut down strikeout pitcher that is being over looked.|`|sryHuuqdaa	Pete Rose- This guy gave his entire life , and that of his wife and kids over to the sport of baseball. Kicked *** all of his career both as a player and a coach. However, he has been banned it appears from ever entering the hall of fame because he gambled. That is what I call American Hypocrisy. I've actually watched video of Michael Jordan in high stakes card games, and I'm positive that he made verbal bets on that tape, yet, basketball will not mention keeping that man out of their hall of fame. Check out Pete Rose's record it's all there.|`|hYZIYla0aa	well i will say Pete Rose even though he was caught gambling.His numbers speak for themself.U look at all the steriod issues going on today like barry bonds home king he need steriods to do it.but he will still make the hall and keep the record.i can go on about players and steriods but i won't u get the point.|`|4YdbC6ekaa	Putting aside those players who have been banned I would say players like:<br>  <br>  Gil Hodges<br>  Don Mattingly<br>  Alan Trammel<br>  Dave Parker<br>  Dwight Evans<br>  Roger Maris<br>  Jack Morris<br>  Bernie Williams (when he's eligible)<br>  Ron Santo<br>  <br>  Just to name a few|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Without a doubt:  Pete Rose<br>  His numbers were amazing.|`|287ryVgFaa	All time hits leader Pete Rose|`|9bsYmkV3aa	Shoeless Joe Jackson<br>  --At least I think that was his name....|`|uFIGSbQfaa	I agree <br>  <br>  Joe Jackson|`|TBVR5vV7aa	Pete Rose, he bet on his team to win. I could see being banned if he bet against his team. Completely ridiculous|`|LLeQyWGcaa	Pete Rose|`|0TAld46gaa	Pete Rose|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Well, easily Rose, but the Hall doesn't want him, and this is well-trod territory, so let's move on.<br>  <br>  Ron Santo and Bert Blyleven.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Ronnie Santo|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Pete Rose - His gambling looks like a pretty pathetic thing now with all the steroid issues.|`|AA11720887	Until Pete Rose in allowed in the Hall of Fame, it isn't real.

lYnkvRASaa	Trade deadline is past, they did not move either.|`|AA12162118	I think they are crazy if they get rid of Clemmenson look what he did when Martin was out and MB is no spring chick. I know he frustrated me many time when he was playing against BU.|`|e3hVn0LZaa	No Clemmer will stay in Lowell until the end of the season and then get called up before the playoffs. With Frazee doing good in Lowell they will split time and allow him to develop. Lou got no good offers for either and im glad he didn't trade Clemmer for the sake of a trade. Lou was trying to get an offer but no good offer were given. Weekes in great in the locker room and wont be shopped, he may even be signed next season to back up Marty (weekes is a UFA at end of season).|`|suojKPfPaa	<a href="http://njmg.typepad.com/devilsblog/" rel="nofollow">http://njmg.typepad.com/devilsblog/</a><br>  <br>  Lou said that it didn't make sense to trade Clemmer, because there wasn't a good enough deal, and he is more valuable staying with us, rather than if we were to get something in exchange.|`|fAEVqikAaa	No. nobody would want any of them<br>  plus the trade deadline was over at 3 eastern so your stuck with both of them
P93I8CHtaa	still think giants can win the west|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Dodgers have it|`|c3tADklmaa	Dodgers mostly look like a lock, but don't count out Ari, and SF.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	D'Backs<br>  <br>  They have one of the best pitching rotations in the NL and I think in the West. We all know good pitching shuts down good hitting. Manny can't carry the Dodgers by himself. If the Dodgers can get some decent pitching they have a great shot. The Giants also have one of the best pitching rotations. But they need to stop signing old players!!! (Aurillia, Vizquel, Molina etc) If they can get rid of Zito for some good prospects they can be a contender. The Rockies are not in contention for a number of reasons. Holliday is gone and Francais is out for the year. The Padres have no shot since htey're clearly in rebuilding mode.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Don't think for one minute the Dodgers have this in the bag,last yr Manny played his guts out because he wanted a huge contract from any team but the Dodgers after the season..he didn't get what he wanted so expect Manny to go back and become the Manny being Manny player he was in boston.I think the Giant's will win the NL i belive Zito will be back to his old self|`|AA10349169	Dodgers for sure|`|hJUGtce7aa	I think it may be a close race between the Giants, Dbacks, and Dodgers. All have good pitching, but Giants probably have the best of the three if their young guys stay on track and don't get injured. Dodger fan or not, everyone has to admit the Dodgers have the most potent line-up in the NL West. In the end I think it'll be the Dodgers because of their pitching (if everyone stays healthy) and their awesome line-up.|`|H5Ya4e85aa	I still have the dbacks winning it. They have the most balanced team. they have a good combo between pitching and hitting, while as of now, the giants only have pitching and the dodgers only have hitting.<br>  <br>  but anything can happen in 162 games.........|`|81750c8c3ec42e0cf790243529365937aa	It has to be the Dodgers. They have an awesome roster. Manny will help them out with his power and RBI. Russell Martin is an all star catcher. I hope that Kershaw gets a lot of wins for them. Go DODGERS.|`|6Cp66xdbaa	The Padres ....hahaha... thats my team but ill be glad if they dont lose 100 . <br>  <br>  i think is gonna be the dodgers, they have a great team without manny but now that manny is on board im sure they are gonna take that west.|`|0MuRCU5paa	Screw Man-Ram. The Diamondbacks will win the division.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	LA Dodgers|`|uFIGSbQfaa	LAD or AZ|`|B46t8gkLaa	i say the padres!|`|qusma7x5aa	Rockies
oPYw0QYqaa	Na cos if we gloat we will get " Its only Borough"    but that's fine... Im pleased we won.... we dont need to gloat.. The Scoreline says it all... Lennon and Keane Were Awesome!!!  And Yes Pav and Keane could be good.... And as far as bale goes..... I would love him to play more often but the form that Ekotto is in.. Bale wont get a chance!!! <br>  <br>  O hara needed to come on so we could let him know all was well... Dont know if you saw the game but the Crowd were Excellent (Yet Again)<br>  <br>  edit... Dont worry about o hara.. 30,000 strong were chanting his name..... He seemed quite happy|`|df1beb28ec457339664195de5a03682caa	Yes i do,good combination.But i do have some real issues about Bale,ever since i saw him searching for his hair clip.!!|`|buPeIIreaa	just make the most of it as it doesnt happen very often|`|x4QambMNaa	Maybe, Let See...<br>  <br>  I Dont Care Who Will Be The 1st Team...<br>  <br>  The Most Important Thing Here Is :<br>  <br>  Spurs Wins Over Boro|`|AA12370193	Why not?

c16PCaCmaa	I think on the last lap, if a caution comes out, they should be able to race back to the flag.  I know it's safety rule, but freezing the field before the start/finish line has made MANY good races anti-climatic.|`|GCOrku95aa	The Top-35 rule. I would change it by extracting it all together. If a car that high up in points can't make any given race, they don't deserve to be there. NASCAR said they wanted to help the smaller teams and open more doors for new competition, but when they implemented that rule, they practically shut the door to the smaller teams, making them have to work a whole lot harder to make a race. Some help that turned out to be.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	There's two right now that are very aggravating. The Chase is one and the green, white, checker is the other. When a race is that close to being over, let them race. Nas88caror300 has the right idea about all the cars not on the same lap getting off the track. Realistically, they can't win and most likely won't gain any position. The award for the dumb rule is definitely the new rule in the truck series. Kinda makes ya wonder what they'll come up with next.|`|IrGapExUaa	i think they should be allowed to race back to the finish line  if there's a wreck after the white flag. Also in the Camping World Truck Series i think they need to get ride of the u cant take tires and gas on the same pit stop rule. and in Nationwide i think the top none cup driver/team in each race should get a bonus of 5 points.|`|cMLJPQpBaa	The ''Top-35''  <br>        Fastest 43 cars on Friday, race on Sunday. If ya trash your primary and backup before the race? You load up and go to the house.<br>  The ''Chase'' format is a bummer too.|`|i8soZLfRaa	I would like to go back to:<br>  <br>  1) Top 43 qualifiers get to race<br>  2) Chase, what chase??<br>  3) rubbin's racin'<br>  4) Race back to the stripe. (yeah i know, safety is priority, but holy crap, the racing has gone to he!!).|`|xGxHkj8faa	The Gas Only Rule in the truck series, I would change it back to the old way.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	Definitely The Chase !|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	catfish hates that truck rule pit twice one for tires then gas.  catfish thinks that is just dumb.|`|AA10665398	The chase is useless.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	get rid of the chase format. Go back to the old way.|`|y3j27KMYaa	the free pass "Lucky Dog" if you loose a lap, its to you to come back with the leader lap !|`|AbDAdrXkaa	probably the chase because it makes it seems like a 12 man race while theres 43 cars on the track :0|`|VQHGqYXvaa	I have never liked the chase !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	THE CHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|yt4PN1R4aa	if someone crashes at the white flag, there is no yellow.|`|z6guTqrRaa	Make ALL restarts DOUBLE FILE RESTARTS.

DOUBLE FILE would make MUCH better racing.|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	top 35..............if u are not in the top 35,but are faster than a car that is,u deserve to be in the race,bottom line|`|c3tADklmaa	I've get rid the truck's gas or tires pit rule. Did a small child think of that?|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I'd get rid of the chase, I've never liked it and probably never will.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	I would eliminate the TOP 35 rule in Cup. CUP is supposed to be the pinnacle of stock car racing where only the best of the best compete. I know at my local short track you either go or go home no matter who you are...even the track champion has been sent home a time or two because he didn't qualify. So I think it should be run what you brung and the fastest 43 races. All others are sent packing. No provisionals, no safety nets, just the absolute best racing week in and week out.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|a4LWildhaa	Drop the brain f*rt top 35 drivers after 5 races are automatically entered for the final 31 races. Truly has ruined the competitiveness.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	The Chase...work hard all season and then start at square one for the last ten races.  Its like the whole season didn't matter.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	if there is a green white checker finish <br>  all cars not on the lead lap must exit the track<br>  they seem to "cause" a wreck more than the leaders|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I would loosen the restrictions on the wing angle and ride height of the car. NASCAR needs to allow for some performance variations so the teams and companys can experiment and actually "contribute" and "give back" to the automotive industry, for which this sport is based upon. NASCAR has the ability to influence our automotive industry by the testing of automotive components. NASCAR is too restrictive on how race teams are allowed to build their race cars. I think they should let more manufacturers supply parts, so they can expand on their technologies and men with education, able to contribute to the industry, will be able to make their contributions, via the great sport of NASCAR|`|52Ycgnozaa	Get rid of the no tires and gas on the same pit stop rule that the truck series uses now.<br>  <br>  Make it where they can have as many green white checkers as needed to finish a race under green (like ARCA does)<br>  <br>  Get rid of the top 35 rule<br>  <br>  fastest 43 make it. End of story.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	The top 35 in owners points automatically qualify. It needs to be cut to 25 so that the smaller teams have a better chance to get in. No hold over from the previous year either. The first race of the season is the biggest in the sport, but some teams don't get in because of 35 teams from last year already guaranteed spots.<br>  <br>  LOL, AJ beat me to it while I was typing|`|4l0yGuE9aa	I would do something to assure that a driver didn't go down by being on pit road simple because of a wreck on the track. That is completely unfair for a driver to lead and be fast and a pit stop rule takes him out of contention with 15 laps to go.|`|gr6e1WZEaa	The COT. Part of Nascar"s  name is stock car. The cars should look like stock cars as the name inplies. I remember when you didn't have to put the name of the car on the grill, you knew that it looked like it did when it came off the showroom floor.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	The rule in the truck series where you cant get tires and fuel on the same spot. That's pitiful. I wouldn't mind seeing double file restarts thru the whole race not just the lapped cars.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Change back to old point system & get rid of the chase|`|vIcOdePzaa	I'd say bye bye to the Chase

Remember that Miichael Jordan was cut from his freshman team and look what happened.  Don't worry if you miss shots just take good shots and they might go in and they might miss.

It doesn't matter that you practice hard, it matters that you practice effectively. I suggest you google this. Better Basketball.<br>  Buy their shooting DVD and 1 on 1 offense DVD. If and only if you do everything on their DVD, you will be the 3rd best player on your team. Since it's march watch a lot of March Madness. Watch what players at your position are doing and try to mimic them. <br>  <br>  Cheer up man. Many people get cut in their lives. Getting cut twice is an advantage. Now you want it more than anyone else.<br>  Good luck.|`|z29Pn7I0aa	Try hard. keep your elbow in. it's not about how far you shoot but about how consistent you shoot. follow through. start from short range then once you get your form and follow through perfect keep taking shots and take about 200 shots a day. people always say 1000 shots but no one has that time. believe in yourself. picture the rim being as wide as can be and convince yourself that shooting is extremely easy. that'll get the results.|`|hzGqmYoYaa	It may be because your feet or shoulders aren't square to the basket. Also, be sure you are aiming for the back of the rim, not the front. If neither of those seems to be the problem, maybe its just nerves.|`|v2WaSemMaa	If you practiced half the time it takes you to type all of these questions, you'd be a much  much better player. Cmon dude. Quit beating yourself up. Put the past behind you and move forward. Just practice.|`|bTPiW2iAaa	Ask a coach if he sees any differences in ur shot during a game compared to practices. Lots of times ur shot tends to be a bit different during games because I jitters|`|vUGKu877aa	practice|`|deMsXLVeaa	keep your elbows in and your bum out|`|VmujqxtZaa	numba one what position do you play and also it not always about shoting if you can play good defence and can dribble the ball and give it to your big man or someone who can shoot its all good plus you can go in for a lay up or a dunk.its all about being effective on the court you might be lacking shoots or other things but you can be really good at somethign else to make up for the shoots.and dont just focus on one tign when you practise cuzz if your a great shooter but you cant dribble or give the pass and be affective on the court other than passing your never gonna get chosen.some thign you can do to make up for you shots are play around the world fool around with you shots to figure out where your hot spots are for some its mid range game others its three point in the key wateevr it is then practise from you hot spot just shoot. make sure you have a proper form and your elbows are tucked in its in your face in the center o you body and give it some good ark and when you shoot focus the reason you have this thing were you cant shoot in a team but you can on two on two because you distraced because of other things going on and you worried i mighjt get in **** if it doesnt go and stuff so dont be afraid and dont worry just focus on the shot when you start to fool around with your shoots youll see what form is best for you and you may even discover some techs to use like i did im a great shooter cuzz i really dont need to take shots in a game so i dont practise because i make it up for other things but still you should practise|`|xMJXJPrDaa	Im a big guy. I can't make shots either, but that doesn't mean I try. I play pick up basketball at the park and when they leave me open and I have the ball I shoot it. You need to get the respect of people guarding you. Trust me, on my basketball court the same shot I would take in the park Id miss at home. My brother is a better all-around player than me but when it comes down to a 5-5 game i flourish easily. People call me baby shaq, mini yao ming etc. Also my hook and bank shots are incredible. Likewise, at home I miss them but when playing at the park they just fall in. <br>  <br>  My best answer, keep shooting. Don't be afraid of failing. Just pick yourself up again.

rseD4OG2aa	Good question. WCW really needed a boost to put them over the WWE in the ratings wars and Goldberg was the guy I guess. He didn't really have any discernible talent in the ring and he was one of the stiffest workers in the business. Like you said, his mic skills were poor and he was a circular wrestler. <br>  Goldberg also has a long history of seriously hurting guys during matches. Just look at what happened to Bret Hart, Goldberg ended his career. <br>  Overall Bill Goldberg had an inflated gimmick and even more inflated ego. He was a marginally talented wrestler who lucked into the push of a lifetime. He's kind of similar to Batista today.|`|UWJinEbIaa	He had a good snarl and entrance :)  Come on everybody plays favorites apparently somebody in WCW loved him.   I bet somebody saw him working out at the local Gold's Gym and asked him if he wanna make some quick easy money as a pro wrestler.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I think you need to subscribe to WWE 24/7 and look at the Monday Night Wars Section and look at the WCW Monday Nitro Shows from 1997, Goldberg did a lot more wrestling holds, wrestling moves, and submission holds during his matches than many people remember. He had speed and agility for someone his size. He had an aura of intimidation and his ring entrance music and march to the ring was fantastic. His promos were short and straight to the point. I remember liking them. He got over huge in WCW and if WCW Management had not allowed Kevin Nash to steel the WCW Heavyweight Title from Goldberg, there is no telling how big a superstar he could have become.|`|hWCkg4upaa	wcw needed a cash cow and needed better ratings. that's why they pushed him.

Low-Ki,  American Dragon, CM Punk, Samoa Joe, THE Spanky Leonardo has it.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	When a character is rarely on the mic but is able to still portray his gimmick with a convincing manner as well as use in-ring psychology to do so even more.

NC2BfEvLaa	I watch F 1 once in a while but with My Wife,kids, Nascar , Football ,and work I don't have a lot of extra time left. But with a US team I just might watch it more.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Enjoy F1, but these "experiments" with American drivers/teams have proven to be failures (Michael Andretti and I'll include Ford/Team Stewart in the mix - now). F1 does not need the U.S. and vice versa.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	My first racing love was always F1.. I followed it starting in the 50s, went to allot of races in the sixties, and seventies, met allot of the drivers, knew the people, and very few were snobs.. At least not about the racing.. <br>  NASCAR was just a bunch of guys with jalopies, touring the country, and putting on these little races, at sometimes very small local tracks like E Islip Long Island, where they had an oval so short (a third of a mile), the pole sitter was lapping cars on the first lap..<br>  The only real difference I found between the two, was the money.. The F1 guys drank excessive amounts of champagne (even in the pits.. REALLY), and the stock car guys drank excessive amounts of beer..<br>  My objection to F1 these days, is exactly the same as it is with NASCAR... Stop messing with the rules... And stop taking the racing out of racing..   <br>  Michael Schumacher chilled me to the sport for a while, because I never believed the hype that surrounded him, but he sure did.. I've seen Clark, Stewart, Gurney, Foyt (yes, ol' AJ shared the winning GT40 with Gurney at Le Mans in 67).. Michael didn't come close..<br>  Yes F1 can have some boring races, but as this season has already shown, NASCAR can have them as well..<br>  I Thought the Red Bull team was American.. Scott Speed was a driver..|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I would definitely be more interested with a U.S. based team in F1.  I do like it somewhat and watch races when I can but I like to watch the qualifying most of all.  Those highly technical cars putting it all on the line like that is pretty exciting, sometimes even more so than the actual races.  The races have a tendency to get fairly dull because of the lack of passing and lead changes but just seeing what the cars and drivers can do is cool.  The team orders and overall politics of F1 are also a bummer but you have that to a degree in any motorsport, it's not the driver's fault.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i have always enjoyed watching F1 and if a American based team were to get on the circuit then i would definitely be open to it.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Nope. I only have time in my busy schedule for one form of motorsports. <br>  NASCAR is a priority.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	I think they are cool to watch sometimes F-1 like when they go to the pretty tracks.  They went through a whole city once (the track)  It was really cool.  It is not my favorite, Nascar is.  I just like the way nascar is run.  The people who are the fans, the drivers, the respect of people before a race during  the national anthem.  It is the whole package of nascar I like and that is my first love. Yes, I think that if there was more americanization in F-1, american teams/cars then that might be more interesting and give it more of a homely feeling.<br>  <br>   I like that they have 3 winners <br>  1st,2nd,3rd go up and celebrate in front of everyone in F-1.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Well, I would like to see which drivers join the team first. But it probably might get me interested in F1. Even before the USF1 announcement was made, I have been considering getting into F1. I probably wouldn't be a huge fan of the sport, but I would like to watch it and see if I might be interested in it.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I don't "follow" F1 like I do NASCAR. But I do check in on it every once in a while.<br>  <br>  It may make me more apt to try and watch, or follow more closely. But not as much as my NASCAR.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	I hope they take Kyle Busch. That'd be so awesome.<br>  <br>  And I do watch F1 from time to time, Not as interested in it as I am NASCAR but it is a great racing spectacle. Those are some very advanced autos|`|UVb2a1BZaa	No, because nobody has actually passed anyone in F1 in like 40 years have they?  It's very annoying to watch.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	Nope.   There are two many sporting events to watch where I can make more sense of.<br>  I like watching a few moments of car racing.  :)|`|y3j27KMYaa	of course yes, I enjoy both F1 and NASCAR ! they are totally ddints but I enjoy them both|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Ok, I'll admit I've bashed F1 in the past, but I actually watched a few GP's last year and got into it(ok that and I stumbled on some footage of Aryton Senna on YouTube that was simply amazing), As for a US based team, I'm a McLaren/MB fan(love MB's) so it's not going to make that much of a difference. I actually rented F1 Championship Edition for my PS3 the game's great(BTW it was due back last Saturday, I still have it). Storm Bandit, they run through a city once a year, it's the Monaco GP, I'm on it in my season right now, it's insane because it's so narrow. Oh yeah, one more thing the US GP was at one point run through the streets of Long Beach, CA(Champ Car was doing that and it's one of the carry overs from the merger with IRL). My only gripe about F1 is the damned start times either butt ugly early or really late. Maybe if Ecclestone would figure out how to get another GP in North America, I would'nt gripe as much.<br>  Richard W., Red Bull and Scuderia Torro Rosso are not American teams and in fact are Austrian owned(Red Bull's a product of Austria not the US).|`|GL3TbtHBaa	I started watching NASCAR hardcore in 1993 and have gone to at least one race every year (more like 2-3 races). After Talladega 08 i quit NASCAR. So now ill only watch the Daytona races, maybe a Bristol race, and the road courses.<br>  <br>  I actually started watching F1 at the beginning of 2008, Im hooked on F1 now. And Im glad a didnt get a bunch of Ferrari stuff because I'll be a USF1 fan.<br>  <br>  I like F1 because its different from NASCAR. I know too much about NASCAR and it was boring knowing how everything works. But with F1 i have no idea how it works and Im constantly learning. I like the idea of the points system, i believe it needs some tweeking but i like how retirees get 0 points.<br>  <br>  I believe if America gave it the chance, they would see why F1 is biggest, most popular seasoned league and only #3 to the World Cup and Olympics of ALL events.|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	no, i still won't watch. regardless of wether there is an american team, it still is and will always be a sport for euro trash snobs who look down their noses at NASCAR and who erroneously think F1 drivers are better than NASCAR drivers despite the lack of success former F1 drivers have had on ovals.|`|GCOrku95aa	Maybe just the same chance I have of watching it now. I have tried to watch it in the past, but I just don't understand why people say the racing in F1 is better than NASCAR, when the first 3 positions are 15 seconds apart. I'm not bashing it, I just want some enlightenment on that. By all means, go ahead and keep watching it, I'm just curious as to why such large gaps between positions is more exciting than side by side, bumper to bumper, down to the wire finishes.<br>  <br>  OK good enough for me. Thanks.

5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	You aren't going to like me for saying this but you need a few more than just three or four flies!<br>  <br>  Firstly, what a trout likes to take on one day will often be totally different the next! Secondly i would suggest just going with stocked rainbows to start with-ignore the bluegill until you decide if you really like fly fishing or not. The reason i say this is bluegill will take different flies to rainbows(very often smaller patterns) and they fight a lot better on a lighter fly rod-one which at first you wont want to use for rainbows.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a 5/6wt medium to fast action for rainbows in around 9'6ft.<br>  <br>  For flies-you mentioned a size 22 and 24 Adam's is way too small for stocked lake rainbows-i very often will use that size for small streams and rivers for wild brownies.<br>  <br>  Although dry flies are a route you can take; stocked trout love streamers in all colors as they aren't wise and will take flies out of curiosity-so you will need;<br>  <br>  Woolly buggers-olive and brown works best-those in size 10 and 12 will work fine, use these on cloudy overcast days, its a good idea to get those with a silver rib as it adds a little flash-some with a tungsten and brass beadhead will get down to the deeper feeding fish(fluorocarbon leader for streamers).<br>  <br>  Also i would suggest some dry flies-parachute flies work well but to be honest i use them mostly for river work in fast water with a white wing post.<br>  <br>  Instead i would suggest a few standard Adams in size 12, on smaller waters a size 14 and 18 will work.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest a few Royal coachmans in the same sizes i already stated.

Hook size 10-8.<br>  <br>  The old wooly bugger will work too. It will catch a very good variety of fish including pretty sizable carp.

oMjVp4zGaa	what kind of fish do you like to eat? lots of anglers are catch and release and then there are those who feed the family. I live in Orange County and eat Halibut at least every other week but san diego has the big freshwater bass, cats and trout (during the winter) you are close to the colorado river mountain ski resorts and fishing in Baja for tuna, dorado, marlin and mako's. where else in the world in one day can you golf, play tennis, go ocean fishing, go snow skiing, see a pro football game in the stadium, and see a play written by shakespeare, and go bass fishing in a lake all in one day...... Fishing is great here but we don't have musky, pike, and walleye but we do have an average daytime temperature of 70 degrees year round and no hurricanes or tornadoes. we do however have an earthquake once in a while... sun tans at the beach and earthquakes "shake and bake"|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	*innocent*<br>  <br>  No way, Florida sucks, there's no fish here and nowhere to fish if there were fish... um... or something.<br>  <br>  Oh, ok, I'll admit, Chimp's right, I've got brackish flats fishing five minutes away (and that's if I'm walking slow), surf fishing about 15 minutes away on the longest stretch of undeveloped beach in the state, fresh water fishing... oh, maybe 15 minutes away, again, if I'm walking slow...<br>  <br>  But we have to admit, fellow Floridians, there's already too many people here... you're quite welcome to come down and visit and fish, but I really don't want more people living here, and I'd prefer if about 3/4 of the people we have would move the heck out... they give us a bad rap cuz they don't know how to vote or drive or anything, and admit it... most of them are from out of state, so it's not even really Floridians that are giving Floridians a bad name.<br>  <br>  *will enact a competency test when she runs for governor of the state*|`|79366fe7ba342f158b20c761ff8b4203aa	Hands down FLORIDA. Great saltwater fisheries including the keys, Mosquito lagoon, Stuart, Tampa bay, Crystal Rvr and many many more. Great Freshwater too, Lake Okechobee, Harris chair of lakes, St johns river. <all B.A.S.S tour stops, as well as Orange lake, Lake george, blue cypress lake, Lochloosa, Sante Fe lake, Suwannee rvr, and alot more.<br>  <br>  Lousiana and Texas are distant 2nd and 3rd choices.|`|AA11016927	Gotta agree with Brandon & Chimp D, (Thumbs guys!)<br>  <br>  FLORIDA! <br>  <br>  Although I have not experienced Cali or So-Cal fishing, (Thumbs to Peter !) ,  I've fished all around the East Coast and Mid-West and Florida still ranks as #1 in regards to the VARIETY of fishing opportunity's you can experience, (in a SINGLE day).<br>  <br>   Only in Fla can you fish for Largemouth Bass, Snook, Redfish, Flounder, Stripers, Sea trout, Snapper, Crappie, Kingfish, Mahi, Swordfish, Grouper, Etc ALL without trailering your boat to a new location!  Check out the St. Johns River System- <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/outdoors/orl-five-favorite-fishing-spots-st-johns-river,0,6601155.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/ou...</a><br>  <br>  Not to mention the other "perks"- Scallops, Lobster, Oysters, Shrimp; which are all easy to harvest with a bit of practice!     <br>  <br>  There's a reason people move to Fla to retire..........it's awesome!<br>  <br>  <br>  LMAO@Gimme- Your right!

You got the Gulf coast with its abundant blue waters and inshore fishing between the barrier islands. Tons of lakes and rivers that have plenty to offer. Plus there is no doubt with you graduating the possibility of you having a really great career.|`|lECmz3SEaa	Colorado ,Oregon, if you enjoy freshwater fishing.|`|qZsiFMRlaa	There's nothing wrong with New Jersey, saltwater fishing is great. Stripers, blues, blackfish, sea bass, yellowfins, and true albacores are the old reliables. In the freshwater scene  large mouths, small mouths, pickerel and catfish have always provided good fun.<br>  I doubt if you would be fishing every day of your life. You'll need to work too, to support yourself and your girl. The job opportunities in New Jersey  are great.<br>  Think before you decide to leave kid. But should decide to go, go ahead, go to Washington or Alaska. You'll not stay forever young.|`|69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	Really depends on the kind of fishing you like. If you like flyfishing for mountain trout, Florida isn't for you; if you like largemouth bass, Alaska won't do it. Same in the salt -- depends whether you like cold-water fish (salmon) or warm water (tuna, etc.).<br>  <br>  Here's a suggestion -- don't settle down for life as soon as you're out of school -- pick somewhere with a good paying job and decent local fishing (anywhere on any coast if you want saltwater fishing), and spend your vacations checking out various locations, and be ready to move as soon as you find the place that's right for you.|`|BK1GjPT6aa	Hands down, "The fishing capital of the world" would be FLORIDA! Where I live I can do 3 types of fishing, fresh, salt and brackish and all from within minutes of my home. Besides this, Florida is the only state where you can get a largemouth bass on one cast and a Peacock bass on the next. The fishery here is just outstanding and the finest around. Besides all that, when it gets cold down here it just means, " where longer shorts." : ) ~good luck catchin'.|`|iNqN0pp9aa	I have to agree with Bass fishing ***** (love that name!) So. Cal is pretty damn good. There is the bass fishing along with trout in the winter, catfish up to 80 lbs at Irvine lake, Ocean fishing is pretty damn good too though it hasn't been the greatest the last couple of years. It will pick up soon though. I think this summer.<br>  You cannot beat the weather and the earthquakes, they just make you want to get up and dance.<br>  Only drawback is cost of living in so. cal.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	First off, how many times can you put your hands down?<br>  <br>  We've mentioned Florida, Texas, Washington, Oregon, and Australia (although, I'm not sure what state that's in).<br>  <br>  What about SoCal? Good ol' sunny Southern California?<br>  <br>  Majority of the biggest bass on record are from SoCal.  And they're mostly from the same lakes!|`|KbxPl1oYaa	I think it's a toss up with Texas and Florida.  I live in Texas and love the fishing here... the parents live in Florida and I love it there too.  Either way it's a win-win situation.|`|C7SAdyC2aa	TEXAS also google   venice Loisiana|`|LreMm3vlaa	Well Mate <br>  Gold Coast Queensland Australia, have a look and tell me I am wrong|`|w4f05SS5aa	Hands down Washington.  You have the columbia river which has amazing salmon, sturgeon.  The snake river which has great catfish.  The Pacific Ocean which has whatever you need.  Plus the Puget sound which has amazing bottom fishing. Plus tons of lakes and smaller rivers for brown trout, rainbow trout, steelhead.  Plus the environment is gorgeous.

The superstars work all year round, just for that it should be in the sports section. They don't have "seasons" or anything like other sports. Their bodies go through so much on a daily basis.

IoyJXzoyaa	Hydrostatic shock is caused by shockwaves that are created as a projectile moves through a meduim.  These shock waves, while only temporary, can rupture and damage the tissues and organs they travle through.  They emminate outward in all directions from the wound channel that's created as the bullet crushes, cuts, and otherwise displaces tissues on its way through the target.  With the degree of hydrostatic shock caused by most rifle rounds, even bullets that miss vital organs by a fair distance may damage and disrupt those organs from their HS.<br>  <br>  To visualize it, think about dropping a rock in a pond.  The stone is like the bullet, and the HS wound be the ripples sent out in the water.  Even though an animals body is more solid than water, shockwaves still travle trhough them. It's much like waves from an earthquake travling through solid rock and dirt.  And those waves can crack, break, and jostle our organs violently just like an eathquake does to rocks, roads, and building foundationd.  So violently that they cease to function, or rupture and cause internal bleeding.  That along with the wound channel is what causes the quick and massive blood loss that sends an animal into shock and incapacotates it quickly.<br>  <br>  As and aside, most hand gun rounds have comparativly little HS when compared to rifles and shotguns. Thus shot placement becomes more crucial with them as a direct hit to an organ is likely needed to cause immediate incapacitation   of a target.<br>  <br>  To sum it up in a single statement: Hydrostatic shock increases the effective target area for incapacitating/killing an animal as quickly and humanely as possible, hence the more you have, the easier it will be to drop your prey.<br>  <br>  Hope that clears it up for you,<br>  <br>  Greg|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	>>What is hydrostatic shock?<<<br>  <br>  Effect =  fluid being forced out of organs as the result of being hit by a high velocity bullet.<br>  <br>  Cause - The bullet at impact must be traveling at greater than twice the speed of sound to cause hydrostatic shock >roughly 2250fps<br>  <br>  >>Importance to hunting<<<br>  High velocity rifle rounds that cause hydrostatic shock are more effective than those that don't...If you have a powerful, high velocity rifle it's a good idea to know at what range your rifle will still deliver it's bullet on target at greater than 2250fps.|`|0R46pYb3aa	Interestingly, there have been some legitimate studies done that show hydrostatic shock to be a myth.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	To a high velocity bullet, flesh is similar to water.<br>  Hydrostatic shock is the energy transfer through this liquid-like medium when a bullet strikes and the resultant damage..<br>  It's more hype than anything else as flesh is pretty resilient.<br>  Hydrostatic shock was the mantra of the small fast bullet crowd <br>  some years back, but it's pretty thoroughly debunked by now.<br>  the new mantra is 'wound channel', which is only partly the <br>  result of hydrostatic shock.|`|QNX9NET3aa	Did you ever see a high power rifle shoot a water mellon? It is the rapid displacement of tissue in the wound channel. A .30 caliber bullet that opens up to a 1/2 inch after expansion can leave a 2" hole in the game.<br>  It is more a function of velocity than bullet weight.
tLLWMy7iaa	Yes, the Mavs will make the playoffs, but once we get there who know what'll happen. Yeah, everyone is saying we'll lose in the first round, and if our effort in recent games is any indication, we will. However, we are the most erratic team in the league: I feel that we can beat any team (yes even the Lakers, though admittedly not 4 times in a 7 game series) and also lose to any team. It all depends on whether anybody but Dirk and Terry decide to show up.|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	they might make it there, but if they do they'll probably wind up against either a 1 seed lakers or a 2 seed nuggets, both of which wouldn't be a very favorable opponent.  The lakers would be a very tough series for obvious reasons, and the nuggest shotblockers would really disrupt the mav's slash and dish offense.  I'd be very surprised to see them in the second round, but, that being said, stranger things have certainly happened.|`|e26e379c5016ba3a08d40ca9508effaeaa	sure. bring devin and avery back to dallas. i thought it was avery's fault but seeing carlisle can't even get his team to play defense i want the 2005-2007 (2007 before the playoffs started) back. unforetunately, we're not getting them back. cuban has a lot of work to do this season.|`|EydNNf6uaa	if they win against tha spurs tonight, then theyll try to stay in 8th but probably not|`|C4mzZwiWaa	yes but they cant make it to semi final.|`|YGbiIxq4aa	Yes, but out in the first round.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yeah, but out in the 1st round.|`|WZvny7mMaa	I think they will make the playoffs either at the 7th or 8th seed but they will probably lose in the first round.|`|NcXSsE9Vaa	they should be able to hold tight by a game but i think the lakers sweep them first round|`|XLv4hhAnaa	They are not doing so good after the lost to the Thunder...<br>  They might be in the play off, but they will only be for the 1st round.|`|13XU8cCKaa	I think the Mavs will be barely hold on to that 8th spot in the West.

He certainly isn't the same player he was in Sacramento. He is still a really good PG.<br>  <br>  FYI, he isn't the same player he was in Sacramento. He is a little bit older now, isn't as athletic. He averaged nearly 20ppg, 6apg when he was in Sac-Town.<br>  <br>  He is averaging 14ppg, 5apg in ATL. Still good, but just isn't the same player he was 4 years ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I understand that, but he also averaged 19ppg and 18ppg along with 6apg. Plus, it seemed like he always hit the big shots back than. He hardly does it anymore(I know because JJ gets the ball more) but still he had Chris Webber, Peja, Divac back than too.|`|rQoCc4lRaa	Because the Hawks are a pretty underrated team,<br>  I know everyone in Sac didnt forget bout him, <br>  <br>  but as a person, he's really pretty rude. =(|`|6yoQhXsOaa	I haven't forgot about him.

He may have hit clutch shots in the playoffs, but it's a lot easier to do with with everyone worrying about C-Webb and Peja.  Now, too, when the game is down to the wire, Joe Johnson is the one that has to shoulder the responsibility of trying to put the team over the top even when the opponent is expecting him to do so.  And it's "the man" who makes the headlines, and deservedly so.  Given how many games come down to the final few minutes, the ability to shoulder that load is perhaps the most valuable attribute a player can have.  So, while he's definitely a solid point guard that any team would love to have, that's why he's drifted out of the spotlight.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	yea hes a good player.|`|13XU8cCKaa	I haven't forgoten about him.  I don't know about best PG in the East I would say 4th behind Mo, Devin, and Jameer Nelson.  He is the guy you want on your team in the playoffs.|`|LtOxnF0kaa	Cause he sucks

WrDGhduxaa	It is necessary to have good abdominal and core muscles to run well.<br>  When you run you develop your back muscles but not the front, so you will become unbalanced if you don't do exercises.<br>  You need to support the spine so you will stand up and not lean in one direction or the other.<br>  If you tire you will start leaning and that will fatigue you more and cause you to run slower.<br>  If you do not maintain good posture and stay relaxed you are not running as fast as you should even with the same or more effort.<br>  Well developed core muscles also help prevent injuries to the other muscles in your torso.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	Yeah it helps your body hold up better so it uses less oxygen leaving more for your legs arms and heart.|`|ecbkzmrIaa	Having a strong core helps your running exponentially.  The core is what connects the legs and the upper body together.  With a strong core, you stand tall as you run, your legs will be easier to move, and you will feel much stronger.  This is possibly one of the biggest parts of being a runner.  It also makes everyday life easier, allowing for better posture and such!|`|3WEMuGWTaa	Having a strong core takes away some of the burden put on the legs, especially with long distance running. It helps to maintain an erect posture and prevent injuries as well.|`|uOE5vuJnaa	A strong core helps you stay upright during your runs and helps to prevent craps in your side so you can run farther and faster without hurting as much
b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	The problem is probably not you, but legal liability if one of your neighbors gets injured.  If someone gets injured and sues your parents it could be costly.  Parents worry about things like that. Sorry.<br>  - - -<br>  My daughter is turning 16 and wants one too.  I think my neighbors may lack good judgement and use it when I am not home.  The liability is still there, invited or not.<br>  <br>  Again, sorry.|`|AA11714191	You have three ways to convince your parents: with logic, emotions, or character.<br>  <br>  Logically:  "Kids don't exercise much anymore and have begun to get fat.  I don't want to get fat so I tried regular exercising and it's boring. A trampoline will keep me motivated to exercise more."<br>  <br>  Emotionally:  "Tell a heart-tugging story of a successful gymnast/trapeze artist that first started out when they were young on a trampoline.  Say I have a dream of becoming a gymnast one day, please don't kill my dream."<br>  <br>  Based on character:  "A responsible parent is one that ensures the health of their child by providing them with beneficial ways of keeping fit and motivated."<br>  <br>  You have to think about which approach is more likely to work on your parents and tailor your argument to fit them.  When it comes to parents...if you act mature, aren't annoying and give them a good reason you are more likely to get what you want instead of going, "Aww, but moooooom, I really want the trampoline! WAAAAH!"|`|79uzTFl7aa	Offer to pay increased health premiums as it is a question of When, not if, you or someone else will be hurt on this thing...|`|AA215Pxbaa	Just give them the facts and how could they argue?<br>  <br>  Trampolining is considered one of the best aerobic exercises.  It tones and strengthens bones, muscles, ligaments, joints.  It improves circulation and strengthens the heart and lungs and more.  It also releases endorphins stimulating a better mood.  Who doesn't want a happier teenager?  Plus they could use it too.  10 - 20 minutes of trampolining is equal to a half hour of jogging.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that!|`|JSzd77C0aa	Keep begging and tell them if you get too hyper and they say to get some excercise just simply tell them "Well I would but I don't have a trampoline!!" They are great sources of exercise and fun at the same time!

Unknown to me at the beginning of my first class, I had to do Side Stroke as the scissor kick is used with the rescue tube. Make sure you are proficient with all of your strokes. It may be helpful to practice your swimming a few times a week before beginning lifeguarding. When taking the pre-req test, make sure you go first and start at the side with the instructor. Instead of the 15 laps, I had to do 25 as the instructor had a hard time watching my strokes. You are going to have to be in pretty good physical and mental strength as lifeguarding is a very important job and requires you to be at your best all day everyday. Make sure you drink lots of water and have a light meal beforehand, so you have the energy you need. Also make sure you know how to equalize the pressure in your ears for the brick dive!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C2nJJ8j5aa	Make sure you can swim around 300-400 meters thats about 12-16 laps continuously. Also they might do something called "breath counting" which means you go under water and see how long you can hold for (it sounds silly but thats what I had to do) Also just make sure you can swim a long time and can run too. <br>  <br>  Have fun lifeguarding (:|`|iNbU61GDaa	Be prepared to swim a lot.<br>  <br>    Swim 300 yards continuously, using these strokes: 100 yards of front crawl using rhythmic breathing and a stabilizing propellant kick<br>      * 100 yards breaststroke<br>      * 100 yards of either front crawl using rhythmic breathing, or breaststroke or a combination of both<br>      * Swim 20 yards (front crawl or breast stroke), surface dive to a depth of 7-10 feet, retrieve a 10-pound object, and return with it to the surface, and swim back 20 yards. This is a timed event. <br>  <br>  And then after performing those skills with 100% accuracy you must take a written test with a score of a least 80%.<br>  <br>   I honestly didn't prepare or train for it and i hadn't swam in almost a year. If you know you are not a strong swimmer than get into shape. Otherwise, good luck!
rNUyV1EYaa	At this point any draft pick the Cowboys can get for him is good. I would say a third or fourth rounder is the best Dallas can hope for.<br>  <br>  I still think Williams has a future as an outside linebacker for a team that uses the 4-3 defense. At 6'0, 230 he could fit in the Buccaneers or Colts scheme as a linebacker.|`|daRDQE9maa	This is actually the first i have heard of it.. But you won't get much out of him maybe a 3 round pick or so i don't think it will be anything special due to the fact he's been hurt alot... he's a great player but he hasn't really played in a while.. but hey we'll see...|`|mUG8XtNpaa	A team that emphasized hard-hitting over man to man coverage, or a team with just an atrocious pass D in general, could possibly afford a 2nd or so for him.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I see nothing more than a 3rd and maybe a 2010 5th or 6th.|`|gBfPkdroaa	hmm 3rd or 4th round AT BEST.<br>  <br>  but i agree, i think williams can play a little LB in a 3-4, being the middle linebacker.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	4th round pick if your lucky. Hard hitter but gets burned in coverage.|`|xlYjkEIhaa	not much, Williams is old and not very good in coverage, he is just a hard hitting safety who gives up way too many play over the top, so at most i think Dallas will get a fourth round pick and possibly a sixth or seventh round pick|`|dmrpFGxcaa	3rd or 4th at best.  He isnt as good as advertised, he can hit thats about it.  I have a friend who is a die hard boys fan and he hates Roy, you arent losing much|`|SqgXLLnwaa	Late second, early third at best probably.<br>  <br>  I just hope we get some depth in our secondary and D-Line.|`|FKeh9kYUaa	I hope we get at least a 2nd rounder, but he blows so that means either a 3,4,5,6 or 7th draft pick!|`|AJEDjzC1aa	Maybe the Lions 3rd round pick, since the Lions and Cowboys love switching players|`|63PdLNMQaa	4th cause he cant cover<br>  he can only hit|`|TMk46Pfcaa	Maybe a third, and a sixth round pick.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Not much. Williams although an excellent tackler struggles a lot in coverage. He blew coverages too many times and gets burned by even average receivers. I think they can get a 3rd round at most. I wouldn't say second round since there are good safetys in the draft. I would say a late third round or early fourth round with a 6th or 7th rounder

nxymxSUFaa	With one great season and perhaps three additionally very good seasons, Hershiser was basically a .500 pitcher.  Indeed, he won a Cy Young award and also a world series championship but there are many good pitchers that fall into that category.<br>  <br>  In 18 seasons Hershiser totaled 204 wins and 150 loses.  Hardly hall of fame material.  Add to that a 3.48 ERA and frankly it's a no brainer.<br>  <br>  Good pitcher, not a great pitcher.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Orel was good, and he was a team player. I liked him on the 1999 Mets in the game he pitched in the NLCS, but he really only had a couple of great years, and his numbers really aren't HOF numbers.|`|VDbbTUnAaa	Yeah I agree with the first two answers.  While Bulldog was my favorite Dodger and I also went to the first several starts vs. the Angels when he went to the Indians, he's not HOF material in my opinion.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	He ought to be. Forget stats. Being that kind of icon is important, too, and that freaking World Series he had! Wow! The Hall really ought to be about greatness and not just stats.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	He was great for a few years (unbelievable for one year) and good for a few more. No where near HOF though.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	he wasn't really that great he had one really good year which he won the cy young award|`|VY7jIcAXaa	Orel was a good pitcher with one great season, he had several other plus seasons but never had another great season after the 1988 season.  He would be in the Hall of really good but not the Hall of Fame.

LGVrhTFTaa	I think he's deffinately one of the top 3 Japaneese in the league..<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|xQFWjFyZaa	No. Especially not in Fantasy baseball. There are tons of guys who hit .300, and hit more HRs in the process. Jose Reyes, Hanley Ramirez, Jimmy Rollins, Brian Roberts, BJ Upton, Carl Crawford.... <br>  <br>  All of them do the same thing as Ichiro. Ichiro's age is catching up with him as well. I hate it when people say Ichiro could hit for power if he wanted to. He doesn't, so why does it matter if he could?<br>  <br>  Also, he hasn't stolen 50 bases in years.

4gZYucHMaa	I was a marathon runner as well (8 yrs ago) and just started again a year ago. The best advice I can give is to forget what you used to do but concentrate on the now. You have to look at it yourself as if you're a newbie runner and take it slowly, one day at a time and build up very slowly. Perhaps instead of going out 35 mins go out for a 20 minute run and take it from there. <br>  <br>  When I restarted, I couldn't make it 10 mins of running! I was incredibly frustrated and upset with myself, but I built up slowly going out 10 mins every other day until it was soon enough 15 mins every other day and so forth.<br>  <br>  Just take your time and ease into it slowly!!  Good luck!|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Sounds like you're starting around the right amount.  <br>  <br>  When I'm coming from being way out of shape, I like to start with 3 or 4 days per week, running 2-4 miles each time.  Then I build up a little each week, depending how I'm feeling.  Don't worry about any interval or repetitive workouts for the first month or so, just nice easy runs to get comfortable with running.<br>  <br>  You've ran marathons, so you know how to listen to your body, pay attention and don't hesitate to back off if your body needs it.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	Run/Walk.  Start with a five-minute jog to warm up, then stretch a little but nothing strenuous.  Then mix running with walking; when you feel winded, slow down and walk for a couple of minutes, then run again.  Keep track of your time or distance, so each time you can increase what you do by a little, so you see progress.  At the end, stretch again.<br>  <br>  You might also consider joining a hashing group for the social life.  Google Hash and your city name to see if there's one nearby.|`|8ebGghbbaa	If  you were once a marathon runner and  you haven't totally let yourself go you shouldn't have any problem starting with 4 or 5 miles a day. Just get back into it, it's as simple as that. If you feel like your killing yourself lighten it up a little bit.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	I would recomend getting back into it slowly and take your time building up your indurance. You have to be careful not to hurt yourself.|`|tRxg17jqaa	Just keep running and get your base up and do some little speed work to open up your lungs and get back in shape basically.|`|uOE5vuJnaa	Run 4-6 miles 3-4 times a week for the first week or two.  Then do the same mileage but for 4-5 times a week for another two weeks.  Finally start running 5-8 miles 4-6 times a week for the next month and you should be ready to going back to your old routine when you ran marathons. <br>  <br>  This wont happen overnight, it will take about two months until you start to get back in the swing of things
DL8d8pViaa	stretch everyday. while you are watching tv sit in splits and make sure to do both legs. also do bridges to help with scorpions and back things. actually do the skills and have someone hold you in it. try heel stretches on the ground. pull a stretch while kneeling on your bottom leg. have someone stand behind you and pull your leg. switch off resisting them and relaxing about 15-30 seconds about 4 times then switch legs. that should help a lot. make sure to warm up your muscles before stretching try jogging a little|`|mQMsyoReaa	my fran said:<br>  <br>  that you should practice more.. and that you need to practice jumps and stuff, umm ur stretches and stunts:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now answer my question?|`|5O4rX9agaa	Try gymnastic and when your just sitting some where just strench.you can also try yoga

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	St. Louis wanted too much for him.  Simple as that.  Most teams were willing to give up a mid round draft choice, and the Blues were looking for at least 1 first rounder.|`|lYnkvRASaa	St Louis obviously wanted more than anyone was willing to pay.  I guess teams remembered how the last time he was moved at the deadline worked out for atlanta|`|GyGhHpRraa	There were alot of teams looking for alot of players.  I know, for a fact, that Jordan Staal was prime cut in trade talk, but the Penguins wanted too much for just him and refused to include Letang.  I also learned that Atlanta was "begging" for Letang, and even spoke of dealing Kovalchuk.  The original deal was Kovalchuk and Armstrong for Staal, Letang, Gill, and a conditional pick.  But, I guess Pittsburgh is putting all their faith in 4 million a year in a player who was/is a one year fluke.<br>  But, I mean come on.  I shouldn't be upset..  We just signed a 38 yr old right winger who has barely 35 points, kept staal, and kept the same garbage defense.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *sigh*|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Phaneuf......Bless You.<br>  <br>  I think the St.L GM got the case of the Chee Choo or the Too Too so he was unable to pull the trigger. Also I think Tkachuk got a case of the Karyia and didnt have any Pepto, so he was on the pot and didn't get the call to ask if he wanted to be traded to Boston for a box of Nokelainen and some Flutie Flakes. Instead Boston moved on and traded the box of Nokelainen for some guy who fights bulls from ANH.|`|t8gLzYGBaa	it was loyalty mixed with the blues recent success....yeah they got smashed by detroit, but it was a pissed off detroit that just lost 8-0...and the blues played great the first 6 minutes but werent the same after hossa left...many of the blues players young and old said that the team wouldnt be the same w/out tkachuk.....he's done alot for the team off the ice with all the youngsters they have...the blues have played great the past couple months and are 4 points out of 8th and 7th and they're 6 points from 6th....and yeah if someone wanted to throw up a first rounder then the blues might of considered it|`|UzhfaJH2aa	Bare with me while I look down the list of 37 year olds that are worth a first round pick here to see where Tkachuk fits in . It's a short list, nope, don't think he made it. Let me check the 36 point, -10 guys worth a first rounder list. Afraid he didn't make that one either.<br>  For what it's worth, I'm probably not as valuable as I was 19 years ago either. Can't blame the Blues for trying though, but there didn't seem to the same desperation as we seen the last few years.
ST6O0oXsaa	Reggie Theus would be an excellent fit.<br>  I bet they hire Flip Saunders also.<br>  <br>  Those two guys are great at developing young players.

ULSUqmeZaa	Orton will win. I think Triple H will put Orton over, he has done it before. HHH just had a long title run, they won't give him another long one. He only has the title right now because of the storyline with the McMahons and Orton.<br>  They have given the title to heels at the main event. Last year, Orton was heel and he retained the title at WM24.<br>  I'm a HHH fan so I want him to destroy Orton but I really think Orton will win. Even if he doesn't, he will win it at another PPV when he gets his rematch.|`|hVqGuOOPaa	I would like Randy Orton to win, but we all know who is going to win.I think that Triple H is going to win because Stephanie McMahon is a WWE writer.Doesn't that explain why Triple H has a had such a good career with all the titles he had, and he had the WWE championship for so long after he lost it to Edge or someone.Stephanie McMahon better realize that Triple can't always have the gold in the WWE and at least let other people have a chance to get the gold.|`|ETkqlgqwaa	Well Mickie as a mega heel beat Trish at WM so you don't know. You'd think HHH would win and after Randy RKOed his wife and put him through hell. But he may lose the title.|`|GQWGLSexaa	i hope HHH wins|`|JeACGbWNaa	Triple H is the undoubtly the better wrestler of the two and i want him to win, but, i think Randy will win so Raw has a title again, then a week later Triple H will be draughted to raw in the draught lottery, and set up The New Evolution involving Himself, HBK and Batista, solely to take out and destroy Orton's legacy once and for all, and then he will get back the WWE title where it belongs.<br>  <br>  :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)|`|VlvektSJaa	I want Orton to win!!|`|qwdh7N6saa	maybe Orton will win.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	I want Orton to win.

But he will probably lose the title at backlash to Orton.|`|EzHyG66Uaa	Triple H wins.
5xIroQjMaa	It's less on the type of heel, and more on who plays the heel. For example, both Undertaker and Kurt Angle have played monster heels, but Undertaker is far superior to Angle. The person doing it matters alot more than the type of heel.|`|18LodFaiaa	the best heel, to me, is the ones (like edge) where they go to your town, and diss the hell out of it, and gets everyone fired up.|`|skIPrlaVaa	edge because he plays around with the fan by yelling in their face  telling them that wrong on smackdown which makes him get heat and cheated in his last match so he's keeping it alive|`|qhTxeSnbaa	Edge - He knows how to get people to hate him. Even by saying they all are "WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG!!"|`|tuwHboNnaa	Well everyone has their own preferences, but i like the cocky arrogant heels the best, like Jericho, Edge, etc.|`|QbY18bjkaa	the hhh heel character was great <br>  <br>  nd Jbl each time we thought they would lose they could out on top<br>  <br>  so i guess the over coming heel character|`|lGIL36faaa	at the moment randy orton!|`|310m2T4Daa	RANDY.... ORTON.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thats all i haft to fuhkin say hahahahahaha.|`|hWCkg4upaa	Triple H! Because when he was heel you couldn't help but love to hate him.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Edge|`|InX5Pfl5aa	You got your heels mixed up...<br>  <br>  CJ is the coward...<br>  <br>  Orton is the Legend Killer...<br>  <br>  And Edge is the Crazy Man always has been...|`|UWJinEbIaa	Jericho style the talker that can make everybody hate him with mere words.  Regal is good at being the tough guy who has a vast knowledge of how to torture people in that very ring.  Or you can go old school and have the manager cheat to win using his gimmick weapon.
stpnZS6taa	Football is the most popular spectator sport. I believe soccer is actually the most popular sport for participants, though not, of course, at the professional level. <br>  <br>  Granted though, the latest studies on the subject of TV spectators is several years old and the results even then were not what you'd expect. Football was most popular, but what we tend to think of as the other "major" sports were all beaten by figure skating, which has a HUGE following among women. Due to the dearth of figure skating coverage and the move of skating to cable only (due to the greedy b@stards at the ISU) and actually now to web only, the viewership has fallen off a cliff. But the second most watched sporting event ever is still the 2002 Olympic ladies long program battle between Michelle Kwan and Irina Slutskaya (which was actually won by Sarah Hughes). <br>  <br>  In that old study, the popularity for TV viewers was football, figure skating, basketball, baseball, Nascar, hockey, golf. Since then, though, Nascar has risen in popularity (and many would say the in-perseon audience rivals other supposedly "more popular" sports), baseball and hockey have fallen and golf, though it gets massive airtime has languished. Figure skating has left TV, dropped so far off the radar that even the rabid fans can't find it and barely care. <br>  <br>  One has to wonder what will happen if the economy goes further south...|`|ZRk15H9Caa	Yes it is the most popular sport in the United States
Zd5T9m23aa	hey they are not that bad so don't get nervous. just be sure to be loud and smile allot. if u do that that means u have allot of spirit that you are willing to put forward toward the team. i have been through allot of tryouts. and i have made every one of them. i am not flexible, and i don't know how to do a cartwheel. but i was smiling allot and cheering as loud as my voice would let me. and that is what they are looking for that they don't tell you about. oh and last thing have confidence! :)
b434f82ffd539a51483616ba685e870caa	If you're not biking there is no reason you shouldn't be able to go. This will be a pricelss childhood memory. Be sure to use that in your argument with your parents, but don't throw a juvenile hissy fit.

Have you talked to the others going on the trip to see how they feel about it?  A week is not a long time to allow the injury to heal and even an unintentional bump could reinjure it, even though everyone is "really careful".  Part of a camping trip is to have fun and not constantly worry about your injury.  You didn't say what grade you are in or if the school trip is every year.  Your parents are concerned about you and are doing the right thing.  You can go on the trip next year when you are healed.

e0jIVJSUaa	It sounds to me like it's either fear, a lack of lower body strength, or a bad habit.  Here are some suggestions to fix each:<br>  <br>  Fear: Skate with a large chair, a large pylon, or holding on to the boards.  You can also try wearing hockey equipment (almost totally eliminates the pain of falling), and practicing falling (if you can fall properly, it won't hurt as much) and getting back up.<br>  <br>  Lack of Strength:  Not much you can do.  The strength will come with practice.  You can try tying his skates a little bit tighter, especially around the ankles (but be careful not to make them too tight, numbing the feet and cutting off circulation) — this might help support his ankles a little better.  There's no sense making a kid do dry training to improve strength. Careful not to let it develop into a bad habit, though.<br>  <br>  Bad habit: You have to work it out.  **Keep the knees bent**.  Lean forward a bit.  **Try skating with feet closer together**.  Practice stopping (you need ankle control to stop properly, so this should help develop it).  If he can skate with his ankles strait sometimes, nag and point it out until they're strait all the time.|`|yQYP7yFuaa	Skate around with a chair to hold onto, to this is how i learnt to skate|`|axxQzOCHaa	Think to when you started out yourself. If unable to do so, ask your old coaches for tips. A mistake I see too many beginners make is using rental skates which rarely have the support they need or buying skates that are too stiff + therefore have trouble breaking in<br>  <br>  edit - Good insight John|`|AA12162118	Tell him to hold on to the boards until he looses his fear or falling! He is going weak in the ankles and spreading out because he is concentrating mor on keeping himself up than learning how to skate. I have coached learn to skate programs before and most of the kids were younger but you can see the panic in the faces. Hold on to the boards until you feel comfortable.

WST15Sm5aa	I have the same problem, although I am probably quite a bit younger, and run a 5:35 mile. I find that stretching before and after your runs, and doing a warm up run before my race usually helps. Also, try and run a few miles at your race pace to increase the amount of lactic acid your muscles can deal with. And talk to your coach to see if he/she has any suggestions.

PSVhBTlgaa	A fun question to think about. I doubt anyone has the experience to give an authoritative answer. I see it going one all but as to who has a better chance in the opponents domain, assuming they have some months to prepare for the fight, I say the boxer.<br>  <br>  If a decent boxer lands a punch well against someone without a proper posture and defence the opponent is knocked out and the body goes rigid before they hit the ground. This should not happen in the sport of boxing because no-one with such poor skill will be allowed in a ring. I've seen this happen in MMA. The 'victim' ha ha came to but was dazed and stunned, the fight was over. The crowd got very upset as it was the home fighter who got hit by a former boxer making his MMA debut. So in MMA simply using what they know a boxer can devastate anyone who gives them a chance to use their punching skill, and if they learn some grappling basics then they are in with a chance. Otherwise they will be outsmarted, exhausted and punished for high centre of gravity.<br>  <br>  A MMA in a boxing ring would need to use very solid basic boxing skills otherwise the boxer would punish them for poor technique. Most of their MMA knowledge would be useless. If the MMA fighter had great stamina, speed and strength they would put up a good fight and if they showed stronger focus and fighting spirit could even win.<br>  <br>  With no training, it is all about frame of mind, and I would say boxer again. As I say, I doubt anyone can give an authoritative answer.<br>  <br>  Perhaps some people think you asked who will win in a free fight which is also a fun question.<br>  <br>  in a brawl MMA because it is close range.<br>  <br>  in a real survival fight ie lasts less than 5 seconds your life is at stake your instincts are automatically at their height, whoever has the fastest movements as part of their training and lowest centre of gravity will win i expect. Being genuinely psychotic and/or on drugs would surely help. I believe someone with 20 years + of tai chi/bagua training and real combat instincts (otherwise they can't use what they know) would have the advantage over anyone else in a survival fight even if the one fighter was twice as big and greatest MMA in the world.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	The boxer has a theoretical better chance at boxing and the MMA practitioner has the theoretical better chance in the MMA match.<br>  <br>  These are two different sports with different rule sets. Punching overlaps between the two and in this field many people believe that boxing is second to none. So in a boxing match, someone who trains solely in boxing will win. In MMA striking isn't only limited to punches so an MMA practitioner that has solid kicks will have more options to work with.<br>  <br>  MMA has a lot of striking but grappling is a huge part of the game. MMA practitioners train for this type of fighting and would have an advantage.<br>  <br>  Both stand a chance because both are trained fighters. Within the rule set of each sport the athlete that trains for it the most will have the theoretical advantage (the better man doesn't always win). <br>  <br>  This is like asking whether a football player has a better to chance to win in a soccer match or a soccer player in a football match.|`|hktObp72aa	An mma fighter has a better chance of winning a boxing match. I say this because the only boxer I know of that fights mma on the side is the way over the hill ray mercer. Many mma fighters also have pro boxing fights under there belt.(Anderson Silva, K.J. Noons, Andrei Arlovski, Pat Militich, and many more.)|`|fRosDAZEaa	It depends.|`|5xG69Mjtaa	Well this is a pretty open question.  I mean what sort of fight are they in?  Is the mma fighter permitted to do everything he could in a mma bout?  If so, obviously he would have an distinct advantage for reasons stated above ( not gonna reiterate).  Though if not, and only punches are permitted, I'd say most mma fighters today would be at disadvantage.  As do to diverse nature of mma, there are not many around that possess the kind of boxing skills to compete with a seasoned boxer.|`|RBYW9SMKaa	Of coarse a mma fighter wins. As you know mma has been made by combining many styles. They know the weak points of the opponent and if he/she gets hold of his/her opponent then they know its cut. They know to use the cage ,which is of more benefit.|`|GTWvCkpMaa	MMA fighter has a better chance to win. Remember there is the punchers chance.

I'd say MMA wins in boxing if they used MMA gloves. But those big pillows make it last too long and MMA fighters do not train for 4 hour fights. Boxers do. With pillows, boxer wins. Usually by long boring decision.

T2UZXarLaa	Salomon is originally a ski company that started making boards once the sport became popular. Because they have years of top of the line ski making under their belts they had some idea what they were doing when they started making boards.  However, their top priority is still skis so most of their boards are pretty average.<br>  <br>  Burton is an all snowboarding company thats become really popular. They charge like a top of the line company but their boards dont fit that standard.  most burton boards can actually be pretty nice but the price you pay isnt worth it.  there are better boards out their for better prices. dont listen to anyone who says burton is the best because they do not know what theyre talking about.<br>  <br>  Burton probably makes better boards overall but youre going to pay alot more for a burton board that is the same quatity as a Salomon board|`|QuQioUd7aa	I got the salomon surface this year, i like it, i don't have any problems with it, i played around 500 .|`|YTxHBuTfaa	They both make good boards.

4kdlE54Paa	I am not a Vikings fan, but I think you probably don't understand the real benefit Sage Rosenfels is to your team.  The problem with the Vikings was the fact that they were not consistent in the passing game to prevent defenses from stacking the line.  Although the running game was excellent for the Vikings, they could have done better.  Tarvaris Jackson is too inconsistent and has a low completion percentage.  Sage Rosenfels did a fine job as a back up for Matt Schaub on the Texans completing 66-67% of his passes.  That is a very good stat for a team that is looking for a player to just manage the offense so the running game can dominate.  A perfect example would be Kerry Collins on the Titans.  He is not a huge playmaking QB, but he was consistent in completing passes and opening up the running game.  The Vikings and Titans play similar football.  They both try to win with a dominate defense, clock control, and a dominate running game.  In their team philosphy is way different than let's say the Patriots who win with a dominate passing offense.  The Vikings only need a QB that can complete passes and keep opposing defenses honest.  Rosenfels is that type of QB that can do it.  Don't expect the Vikings to try and get a top dollar QB that will not work well in their offense.  They have all their money tied up in other skill positions.  Trust me, I think the Vikings did the right thing and they did it with a hell of a deal.  Other QBs that work in this type of offense are also the Falcons (Matt Ryan) and Ravens (Joe Flacco).  It works bro.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|a13b768dd41d6e9fbc8d5d241eee768aaa	Life without birk will be HORRIBLE for Sage or TJack... let alone the fact we still don't have a right tackle|`|a4soGEksaa	yea if they think sage is the answer they're dumb. personally i think they should sign leftwich or garcia that can lead a team . bt it looks they're going to give both jackson and sage a chance to battle it out if  jackson wins they go 9-7 10 -6 best 11-5 if sage wins i think they go   9-7 because we clearly saw he cannot put the game away.
z7JsVzcnaa	Your top shooting string needs to be tighter.  As tight as possible.|`|HPeXZRuKaa	You need to tighten the top shooting string. careful not to make it too tight, otherwise it will go straight into the ground when you pass or shoot.  You may also want to consider tightening the sidewall strings near the scoop at the top of the head. this will stop the mesh from flexing to much when the ball is released over it.

6HwcJDbiaa	It is up to the ref if the kick was inadvertent or intentional. <br>  <br>  In basketball the defense is allowed to jump straight up in the air, it is called the 'principle of veritcality.' If the offense initiates the contact by jumping into the player or kicking her, then it is an offensive foul. (If the defense jumps towards the offensive player and they bump it is a defensive foul.)<br>  <br>  If the ref feels like the offensive player is intentionally kicking the defensive player then the ref is free to not only call on offensive foul, but to call a technical foul if the ref believes the player is being malicious.|`|z29Pn7I0aa	it depends where they kick the person. if you got the jewels youd get a tech and would have to deal with it. if you kicked them and fell down the refs would probably call a fall on them. like your in the air and act like they really kicked you. some refs might call a foul on you|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	well, their body weight really wouldn't lend them to kicking their feet out that hard unless they were intentionally going to kick them, and in that case a technical foul would be called for.<br>  <br>  Reggie Miller was the master of moving his legs out to draw contact. he wasn't kicking them perse, but he was using his legs to nab a foul, and it worked really well.

I think The Show owns 2k9, but you're asking portable or home based play. I would rather play 2k9 on my big screen, or any tv, than The Show on my psp.

Also The Show 09 on the PS3 is amazing, best MLB game ever hands down.
Vjan4Vq2aa	Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>  Why do people say Messi? I know he's amazing, but he's not the best YET. There's not enough proof that Messi can take the title of best player of the year from Ronaldo when Ronaldo got just two months ago. I know how he has more goals, but that's because he's a striker (Ronaldo is a winger) and it's easier to score in La Liga because of the style of play. He's too young, but by the end of next year, he'll probably be best player in the world. <br>  I don't know why people hate Ronaldo. Sure sometimes a bit babyish, but his skills are incredible. Messi is more fast than skilled, but Ronaldo is more skilled than fast (but not by a large margin).<br>  Today, it's a close call, but Ronaldo is the best player. If you don't agree with me, ask FIFA and the Ballon d'Or guys, who both awarded Ronaldo as the best player.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Lionel Messi is the best player in the world.  Sure he's young, but that doesn't mean he can't be the best, because the performance he has had this season is undescribable, which is proof of his greatness.  CRonaldo is a great player too, and obviously as good as Messi, but his performance is just not like last season's, where it was no question he was the best.  Tides have turned a little bit since then, and Messi seems more wiser and has played better than anyone else in the world.  He's the main reason why Barcelona has been the best in the world this season.  Last season, everyone thought Ronaldinho would be the best again, but he was too slow and wasn't good.  <br>  <br>  Messi and Ronaldo have different/same attributes.  Messi is a little faster with the ball, but Ronaldo has more skill. Ronaldo can also take a beautiful free kick.  But Ronaldo is overrated and he's very selfish, also he dives a lot.  Messi is not overrated, less selfish, and he hardly dives at all.  If you think you've seen Messi at his prime, think again!  He's going to get better and better until he starts to get old.  By then, he would have accompished many things.  Lionel Messi is less selfish and people know him as a great footballer.  Girls like Ronaldo more because of his looks, which I do not like because I don't care if the best player is ugly.  <br>  <br>  However, if either player wins the Champions League this year, one of them will be the best player in the world.  Right now, I have to say Messi because he performs better, and he is better.|`|Bgty97dDaa	i think he have to be messi , when he playes u see that barca playes will and he scores in the most hard times , if u saw todays match with mallorca he played in the seconed half and not from the biggining of it then he made the difference and scored the goal . so that wat made him the best even i think ibrahimovic is good too . and i respect these two player the most .|`|x00tzShzaa	Kobe Bryant hahaha just playing.

hUbNKOTsaa	-knockout(serving game)<br>  you are on one side and kids on another<br>  girls serve one at a time to the side of the net you are on, trying to serve it to a spot where you cant return it. you try to return it to their side and the girl that served it and you volley until it hits the floor or goes out, if it hits the floor on your side, or you hit it out, she gets to go to end of the line and serve again. If it hits the floor on her side or she hits it out, she comes to your side of the net and volleys with you for rest of game. when everyone but one person is on your original side of net, the last person wins and game is over.<br>  <br>  -dead fish(serving game)<br>  half of girls go to one side of net and half to the other. girls on side one lie down in place(inside the court)and stay there, while girls on side two serve and try to hit the target(girls on side one) and if they hit another girl they lie down on side one and girl they hit serves. after a while have the original girls from side one serve and original side two lie down. the point of both knockout and this game is to aim when serving and placing yourself at strategic points where to not get hit, so you learn exactly where to serve it at<br>  <br>  -elimination-volleying game<br>  half of girls on side a and half on side b. they can stand wherever, as long as they are in the court. you throw the ball onto the court randomly and that side has 3 hits before they have to get it over. they volley until it hits the floor, goes out, or one team doesnt hit it over in 3 hits. when it goes out, the person that hits it out is "out" and has to stand on the side lines until they get back "in"(well get to that later) if the person who hits ball 3rd doesnt get it over, they are out,unless it was an impossible hit and was the person before theirs fault, then they go out, or the person before them goes out, but they must decide amongst their team who goes out if it is questionable. If it hits the floor in their side, they must decide who goes out, like if someone doesnt try to hit it and it hits the floor, they go out if just no one goes for it bc they think someone will, they must decide who goes out but someone has to go out everytime you would lose the serve if it were a real game.<br>  <br>  to get back in your side has to get three hits before it goes over the net. everytime they do that , one girl comes back in. if there is only one player left, you must get three volleys to get a player back in. when one team has no players left, they lose.<br>  <br>  the point of this game is to work on teamwork and volleying<br>  <br>  -circle the wagon(must have knee pads for this game)<br>  players get a partner and stand in the circle, one in front of the other. if there are 10 groups, you have nine balls, 9 groups, eight balls etc in the middle of the circle. you call mount and dismount over and over as many times as many times as you want, and the person in back mounts and dismounts on their partners back like they are going to have a piggyback ride. so when you call mount, they mount on their partners back, and dismount obviously they dismount then whenever you call "circle the wagon" the run around the circle then dive under their partners legs and tyr to grab a ball, who ever doesnt get a ball is out. so basically the "circle the wagon" part is like musical chairs. repeat until there is one team left. last team wins<br>  <br>  the point is to get them to use their kneepads and it helps with speed<br>  <br>   those are some of the fun games we did at camp and practice. a good way to motivate a team/person to win is the losers/loser has to give winner/winners 30 second ball massage- lol they feel really good thats what we did at a volleyball camp once
5pyHgpZkaa	it depends on a number of factors other than indoor/outdoor and wind/no wind. Mostly it depends on the marker and barrel, considering how all markers shoot at different distances (not by much though). And also it depends on the paint, an average paintball will not go as far as a paintball that has a thicker fill. And you have to have a good paint to barrel match.

But to answer your question, we cannot answer your question as it is.  We need to know other variables.  Paint/barrel match, type of barrel, exact weight of the ball, the degree to the perfection of the shell of the ball, angle at which the ball is shot (arc), and the elevation of the marker to take the drop into account.  Other contributing factors are temperature, humidity, and are you figuring on breaking shots or just where the ball will land.<br>  <br>  Paintball is a very complex sport, especially when you are trying to calculate precision shots, it takes a lot of experience and is mostly by ear...<br>  <br>  If this is for safety, approximate 100 meters.|`|OXLs3q3Kaa	probably 100-200 ft

bxnMQQMJaa	steve|`|5gKGtSriaa	Steve Smith is best, I love Chad Johnson though. <br>  <br>  Both are great players, but Delhomme fired tons of throw, just way up there and in triple coverage, 5'9 (small), he caught the ball. He's also consistent on his preformances (LOL) and he's built an amazing trust between him and Delhomme. Inseperatable, when Delhomme feels pressure, just chuck it up there and KNOW Steve will catch it.<br>  <br>  I'm a fan of the Panthers, but I respect Chad alot. I think he's great.<br>  <br>  BUT, STEVE WONDERS wins this pair.<br>  <br>  Just think of them together though! :)|`|XCwjsfz2aa	Love um both, but if you are talking about right now......Steve.

There used to be a Chad Johnson, but he legally changed his name to Chad Ocho Cinco.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Steve Smith and I won't lose a second sleep about it. The only thing Smith lacks that I love in a receiver is height. But if you watch him game to game and see some of the catches he makes, you'd swear he WAS 6'4 or 6'5 in height. His jumping and speed abilities are unbelieveable. The only guy in my opinion who can give Smith a run for his money in terms of best hands is Larry Fitzgerald. At times he even looks like he's performing in the Olympics! Morale-wise, there's room for improvement, but I would take that chance with him way before I did with Johnson (who, by the way, is also older than Smith).|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Smith all day long.

bxnMQQMJaa	Palmer|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Palmer. I realize he struggled this past year, and I also realize a big part of his success rode on "Ocho Cinco" and Houshmandzadeh, but from a statistical standpoint, Delhomme is simply not in the same league. Unlike Palmer, Delhomme wouldn't succeed in a pass-heavy type of offense. This in essence means that Palmer (at least in my opinion) has more knowledge about the game and is definitely the superior of the two at reading defenses.<br>  <br>  Give me Palmer anyday.|`|xt4vcVIiaa	Carson Palmer - He's a big play, consistent quarterback.<br>  Delhomme is turnover prone in big games|`|TXq3bLKRaa	Im not sure...I personally think Delhomme would be better...Palmer is going through...some...issues.|`|5gKGtSriaa	Carson Palmer is much better, Delhomme has a great WR and that's why everyone thinks he's good, I'm a Panthers fan, trust me. <br>  <br>  He's had his moments, playoffs and a regular season game.

If you look at some of the games they won Delhomme sometimes threw 2+ picks and threw under 150 yards and still won. All because of those running backs. He was exposed against the Cardinals, they shut down the running game and Delhomme had to carry them, unfortunately he couldn't. <br>  <br>  Palmer was just injured. As you saw all he needs is a average defense (or better) to make the playoffs. He can make plays. Once their defense is set they can be a contender|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Carson Palmer. He will be healthy this coming season and be back to tearing up defenses.

OHs8yJiOaa	I believe your options are going to vary by which model you're looking at.<br>  <br>  Though not an expert with their ski goggles in particular, I'd tend to think one of your largest decisions is if you want to go with a polarized lens or not. Snow would normally be prime conditions for a polarized lens, but they don't have a lot of options in them when it comes to ski goggles. They're a bit more expensive, too.<br>  <br>  Especially if you're in mostly sunny conditions, I'd expect you'd want something with polarization. It would also probably narrow your choices down to something like grey polarized vs. VR28 polarized, in which case I'd easily take the VR28 polarized as a very nice lens to see through as well as it being a contrast lens -- it would certainly be one of my top choices as a lens for sunglasses in snow conditions.<br>  <br>  You'll probably want to sample their lens tints online and consider their light transmission levels, etc., as well as read others' reviews of them (see below).

No disrespect to Adrian Peterson, he's an amaazing back and led the league in rushing, but 245 yards more on 90 more carries explains it.  DeAngelo also led in TDs as well, and like i said, no fumbles at all.  You cant ask for more than that from a RB.<br>  <br>  Again, no disrespect to Peterson, but total yards is based on how many times you carry the ball.  Yards per carry is a more important stat, and 5.5 ypc is AMAZING.  18 TDs, no fumbles, easily DeAngelo.  Peterson only had 10 TDs, but 9 fumbles.  Hes a great RB, but he fumbles too much to be the best in the league.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Ill take Tomlinson out of the equation because I dont know what his injury status is.

Emq9jEc1aa	The Orvis Pattern Indexes are hard to beat. And you're right in that the Benchside Reference is more for technique than pattern. I consider it a "must have" but it is one that I recommend adding only after you've mastered some basic patterns and basic techniques.<br>  <br>  Dave Hughes' "Essential Trout Flies" is also excellent. And if you're wanting to spend a few more bucks, his "Trout Flies" is all you'll ever need. BIG book, and about $50, but loaded with excellent info.<br>  <br>  No, I'm not Dave Hughes  :) and there are many other books out there which are just as good (maybe better). I've been tying for 30 years, and the book I use most often is the Orvis Pattern Index (several volumes, which can be hard to find but usually show up on eBay fairly often).

That little series is excellent, and there is a plethora of patterns there as well with good to excellent instructions and technique for fishing them once you've tied them. <br>  <br>  Al Campbell was a true fly fisherman who shared all he knew with anyone who asked.

Tk29jePpaa	That indicates what type of pitch you just released. I cant tell you exactly what color does what because I dont know what pitcher you are using but the change up is usually not a color and fastball is usually red and curve is blue.....i think thats what yours will look like anyways.
qqt0GTW8aa	If the L feels too snug then go with the XL, you can always wear a belt.<br>  You need to be able to bend easily at the waist, knees etc.  You also don't want to feel constricted around the knees or butt.<br>  Sounds like it might be better for you to go with the XL.  You also may be layering in the colder weather and you would want room for that as well.|`|jTaW3goeaa	If you wear more underneath them they are going to fit tighter which you would do on colder days, but on warmer days when you wear less underneath them, they are going to be looser.  This is why it is important not to buy pants that are too small, even if they are a  little baggy, thats ok.  Thats better than being to tight.  If they are so baggy that they fall down, just buy a belt, wear it and they will stay up|`|bPcFyE0Xaa	I like to wear a Vans belt with my board pants.

lzEuuseJaa	Most private schools, day and boarding, do not have merit-based financial aid awards anymore. Generally they only have needs-based financial aid. Typically I've seen only Catholic schools with a few merit-based awards.<br>  <br>  What is likely to happen, if your family can qualify for needs-based financial aid, and you are great in a sport that they need players in, you will be more likely to be admitted to the school. Often private and boarding schools have 2 - 5 applications per spot.  <br>  <br>  Unless your parents make over about $200,000, it's worth it to try for  needs-based financial aid. Usually your parent's info will be sent to a clearing house and the clearing house will give a recommendation to the school about how much your family can afford to pay. If the school offers you a spot, they will let you know how much financial aid they can offer you. All of this info is kept confidential. How much financial aid you are offered depends on the school. Typically 10% to 30% of kids are on some sort (maybe not full tuition) financial aid in private and boarding schools.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in school for Sept 2009, you'd better get moving. Go the schools websites and see when their application due date is and if they take late apps or have rolling apps, because for some areas they are already sending out the admissions decisions this week.<br>  <br>  Boarding schools:<br>  <a href="http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.schools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schools.com/</a><br>  <br>  Private schools:<br>  <a href="http://www.privateschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.privateschoolreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	If you are really good then a High School will look at you for example Carmelo Anthony went to Oak Hill Academy because he was phenomenal in High School.

hODNT0nZaa	t is tough to get sponsored. Your best bet is to get yourself riding on film. Put together a little sponsor-me video about a minute and half long. Show off your strong points. Whether you are better on rails or big jumps, making sure to showcase your talents. Companies, I'm sad to say, focus a LOT on image these days. There are different companies for different styles. Go watch some videos from different companies and production teams. Figure out where you fit. If necessary you can adjust yourself a little bit but BE WHO YOU ARE. Companies want guys who are straight forward, hard working, talented and cool. If you put your heart in it and you have even a little bit of talent you will find receptive companies. Hit their website and get a contact email or phone number. Call them but don't bother them, they don't want some grom talking their ears off every other day. Go to events, enter the amateur competitions and push yourself. Companies look for guys that go for it, every single run. Even if you don't place initially keep at it. Ride as much as you can and progress your riding. There are people riding professionally that were worse then you when they started getting flow. Believe me, I've had friends riding for companies and I was better on the mountain then they were.<br>  <br>  Keep at it! The more events you go to the more people you will meet. The random guy next to you in the food line might be the rep for your favorite company. Talk to people, be honest and network. Knowing someone's name is one thing but knowing their products is a huge bonus. Know your equipment and know your tricks.<br>  <br>  Also, go over to your local board shop and talk to the guys there, chances are they either have a team or know who you can get in contact with. Be nice to your shoppies, it's what they do for a living because we love it!|`|WTw9BSOYaa	The Number One thing you can do, Is to get yourself in competitions and place. Doing this will show the companies that it isn't just you who thinks you are good.<br>  <br>  Videos are a good idea, but companies get tons of them in a year, for the most part sponsor me videos only get watched if you are known or a friend of someone at the company. the honest to god best way is to make a name for yourself by doing competitions.<br>  <br>  The order normally goes like this ->discounts at a shop-> shop team-> discounts/hookups from reps-> full hookup from rep -> regional AM status -> country AM status -> International Am status -> regional Pro -> International Pro<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can skip certain areas, but for the most part you wont ever simply start out as a pro or even an am, the first step is to get your foot in the door at a shop, then start hanging out when the Rep for companies shows up to showcase their product, from there its all about who you meet and what they think of you.<br>  <br>  Riding for a shop will also get you to the hill and get you rides to comps, which is major, you get in with the right shop young they will hook you up proper all the way through your life.<br>  <br>  Id say start going to competitions and start making a name for yourself in the local snowboard scene.|`|uWBn5HpOaa	send a video to skullcandy, or small brands for now. don't go big with nitro or burton or forum or anything like that. just start small and then progress your way up. filming tips would be getting a good angle and you wouldn't want to have someone standing in one spot and filming your line. get someone who can film while riding next to you so you get a better angle.|`|ZUFn8kTAaa	Dan Y gave you great advice.

E7PwbMuXaa	If it were me, i would opt, for the renting from a dealership, for the weekend. This way, you can go where you want, stop when you want, and, you don't have that annoying guide, on your back, all the time. They may know the area, true, but, you can see just as much, on your own, without the guide, actually. Like I said, you can go where you want, and, you can also stop when you want, as well. Espically, if you see something, that you find of interest. This way, on your own, you can stop to check it out. With the guide, you won't be able to do that. Nor will you be able, to do much else, but, go where they go. If you really want to have a good time, leave the guide, behind, and, rent a snowmobile, from a dealership. Also, by renting the snowmobile, you don't have to pay for any up keep, on the snowmobile. If something were to break, that is not your fault... It is their problem.

The word is that he will probably be a running back. Time will tell, he was a talented athlete, just immature and lacked values.|`|lrJN4M49aa	Yes. <br>  First off get your facts straight he was SUSPENDED indefinely. That means he is serving a suspension that the commissioner hasn't put a time frame on (like a week, or a month). He wasn't banned from the sport. The commissioner can rescend that. Most experts are expecting when he is released a suspension from anywhere from 4 weeks to a year. It just depends. If Michael Vick can still perform on an NFL level and be productive a team will pick him up. Its about winning if a coach or GM thinks he can help them win he will be signed. He hasn't finished his sentence yet and both San Francisco and Minnesota have expressed interest in him. If Goodell believes mike has reformed expect to see him in the NFL again.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	he has been suspended from the NFL indefinitely! he will not be playing in the NFL ever again!|`|6XHesUihaa	It all depends if a team signs him obviously.|`|acaAycEXaa	Not in the NFL.
75GcSkF6aa	When a player gets waived, he is said to be "on waivers"<br>  <br>  while on waivers, 48 hr limit, any team that has the space to take the contract of the player can "claim him off waivers", and that new team is now responsible for paying his original contract<br>  <br>  If the player "clears waivers', is not picked up in the 48 hrs after being waived, any team can sign the player to a new contract. That new contract does NOT replace his original contract with the original team. That original team still has to pay the original contract to the player. The new team has to pay the new contract for the player.<br>  <br>  The original team and player don't always have to negotiate a buyout with the player. They could just waive him and pay him the full contract.<br>  <br>  Marbury was forced into a situation where he had to accept the buyout because by March 1st, because if a player is not waived by then they cannot be on anybody's playoff roster. He had originally said that he wouldn't take any less money than his full contracct for this season.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	After he get's waived|`|0ytjj1EGaa	after he gets Waived<br>  <br>  He will still be paid Till his contract expires<br>  <br>  or when another team signs him

bqvOOUwDaa	Hello Cazpen.<br>  This section has many many Women football supporters who know as much as the Men, so don't feel as though you are alone. I expect we can all say we have experienced some sort of "but your a girl/woman, what do you know about football?" type of comment from boys/men over the years, but ignore them, prove them wrong, keep asking and answering lots of football questions on here and you shall be respected by many, because not all Men are as sexist as you have unfortunately found, some do appreciate that women DO KNOW enough.|`|RSJbqioUaa	I'm a lass and I'm 15 so I get told "shut up Amie" a lot haha :P<br>  I just prove them wrong :)<br>  Okay, I admit.

I still know that however some girls do, or the issue on the player's "looks" becomes the talking point or is too constantly mentioned to go unobserved, and that unfortunately gives a wrong impression which then may be generalized into making it think that all females watch the sport because of that. Whilst it may be true that overall males know MORE it is by no means true that there aren't women who know MORE than some men, and vice versa. I think the problem here is generalization, and some females which do give their gender a bad rep on the matter...|`|uXXbegw5aa	I know I totally agree.

21J0IIZbaa	Howard would win because he has the strength and moves over Kemp.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I'll pick howard he's much more athletic and he's bigger. in my opinion howard's the better defensive player and kemp is the better offensive player. so i'll still take howard he's a rebound and shot blocking machine.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	dwight howard is too big for kemp, kemp was a lighting quick pf with about the same athleticism as howard.  kemp did have a much better offensive game though, but howard just has that size.  in a one on one, id probably take kemp since he would be able to drive right by him in the perimeter and howard really doesnt have an offensive game.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Good question. I might actually go with Kemp because he had a more well rounded game. He could also step out and shoot the jump shot rather well, plus was a total monster on the inside.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Dwight Howard is Better<br>  <br>  Except in DUNKS|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Comparing Dwight to Shawn is really hard, remember Shawn wasn't a regular starter until his 4th season (he was starting in his sophomore year until his junior year he sustained an injury that sidelined him for 18 games).<br>  <br>  Obviously Dwight would have better stats than Shawn since Howard started out with no real great teammates after T-Mac was traded and Grant Hill still sidelined at the time, In his fifth year Shawn is just averaging 27.5 mins a game to Dwight's 36... Presented below are Kemp and Dwight's stats on fifth season totals:<br>  <br>  Kemp -------------- Howard<br>  PPG 14.5 -------- 17.2<br>  FG% .508 ------- .567<br>  3PT%.143 ------- .091<br>  FT% .716 -------- .603<br>  RPG 8.8 --------- 12.5<br>  APG 1.6 --------- 1.4<br>  SPG 1.2 --------- 0.9<br>  BPG 1.6 --------- 2.0<br>  <br>  Now in projected stats per 36 minutes their stats should be:<br>  <br>  Kemp -------------- Howard<br>  PPG 18.9 -------- 17.1<br>  FG% .508 ------- .567<br>  3PT%.143 ------- .091<br>  FT% .716 -------- .603<br>  RPG 11.5 --------- 12.5<br>  APG 2.1 --------- 1.4<br>  SPG 1.6 --------- 0.9<br>  BPG 2.1 --------- 1.9<br>  <br>  Had the circumstances been as favorable as Dwight's environment (today's NBA have no hand check rule and have a defensive three second rule which could have limited the access of defensive post players in Shawn's time) no doubt that Shawn could have been better. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	If you're talking a game of 1-on-1 to 21 I'd take Kemp.  Kemp was a more rounded offensive player than Howard currently is - Kemp was a decent mid-range shooter where I don't think Howard could hit the broad side of a barn from 16 feet.  In a game of 1-on-1 a consistent jumpshot usually beats a guy who can't shoot.  <br>  <br>  In a game of 5-on-5 I'd rather have Howard on my team than Kemp though - Howard is a little tougher rebounder and a better defender.|`|oMYGtqubaa	I think Shawn Kemp is a better dunker... and can hit an outside shot.<br>  <br>  But, overall Dwight Howard is just so big, stronger and very athletic...  and has the ability to dominate a game in all phases... unlike Kemp.<br>  <br>  Kemp could have big games, but he cannot dominate the way Howard can.   I could see a day where Dwight may have a 30 pt. 30 rebound game....  its very possible.|`|tefmLFmWaa	The Superman-child but I'm betting he can't do the epileptic dunk like the Reignman.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Superman
gincLVimaa	The first priority should be to make sure you avoid re-aggravating your injury or getting a new injury.<br>  <br>  Join the HS XC or Track team and talk to the coach about a plan which would be best for you.  You are young so take your time to ramp up slow.<br>  <br>  Some general guidance for improving in running would be:<br>  Ramp up your weekly mileage gradually, increase no more than 10% each week.<br>  Get to the point where you are running 4-5 days per week, but at an easy pace where you could maintain a conversation while running. <br>  Choose one run a week to be your long run.  Extend that run to be up to 8-10 miles over time.  Ramp slowly.  Again, increase the long run distance by no more than 10% each week.<br>  Once you get a solid base of this type of running, it should become easier to do 3-6 mi runs each day and the 8-10 mi long run.  Your 5K race time should be much improved at this point.<br>  Next, start to introduce "speed work".  <br>  Start by doing one workout per week where you push the effort to 80% max effort for 15-20 min or so - research what a "tempo" run is (a little slower than 10K race pace).<br>  Add an "Interval" workout where you do 800 - 1200 repeats at your 5K race pace with a one lap (400m) jog in between.  e.g.  start with 4 X 800's and ramp up to 6 X 800's.  start with 2 X 1200 and ramp up to 4 X 1200.  5 X 1000 is also good.  You can also ladder up / down (e.g. 800 - 1000 - 1200 - 1000 - 800, etc)<br>  Only do one or two speed workouts per week and always with rest or easy running recovery day(s) in between speed workouts.<br>  If you are feeling strong, try to get to 6 running days per week or do 5 plus one day with aerobic cross-training like spinning.  Always take a complete rest day each week. Your 5K race time should really improve with the speed work.<br>  <br>  If you make major progress with this and feel strong then sub in some more aggressive "repetition" workouts where you do 200 or 400m repeats with full rest but do them fast - like your 1 mi race pace.  (e.g. 5 X 400 at 1 mi race pace with 400 jog recovery in between).  <br>  <br>  Be patient and ramp up slow.  Listen to your body and stay healthy.  Read some training books (Jack Daniels Running Formula is a good one) and check out running websites like letsrun.com for tips.|`|4LrOVUgnaa	youre too slow,  no help in sight.  choose a new sport|`|A1ohtlWsaa	keep practising|`|uOE5vuJnaa	Run 4-6 times a week for at least 30 min each time, also try to do some faster but shorter workouts and do track in the spring to stay in shape|`|8ebGghbbaa	Just let it heal and do more distance. if you run 8 miles a day and you go to a 5k it will be really short.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	I am a sophmore and was an allstate runner and ran a 16:36 this year.

pSOmwwlIaa	Eazy just took the words right out of my mouth.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Shyt imagine him with Man U or Juve|`|wKnjGSU1aa	I think Guardado is most likely leaving. Deportivo have not paid their players in 4 months, Guardado is without a doubt the best players in Deportivo, most likely Depor will sell Guardado to pay off some debt and their players. Recently on Sky, I heard Juventus might be interested in him, but I also heard from Jorge Ramos that before he got to Deportivo, he had a little meeting with agents from Manchester United, United was interested on him, he was already in word with Depor, so he ended up going to Deportivo. I think that's who Depor will sell this summer, mostly for the debt, it seems like they will be forced to sell Guardado. I would love to see him playing in either Lyon or Juventus to take over Nedved's spot, but Juve also want Diego, Wesley Sneijder, Dirk Kuyt, and a few others, so who knows. Hopefully he goes to a good club, his style of play is not for a little club, it's for a big club.|`|8zgFyfibaa	We'll the biggest rumor is that juventus wants him because since pavel nedved is close to retiring and they want guardado as his replacement. I think that will be a great move if he went to juventus.<br>  <br>  I don't think ac milan would be a great move for him because look at all the mid's they have (ronaldinho,kaka,gatusso,beckham) if guardado was to go he would only warm the bench for milan.<br>  <br>  I hope he goes to juventus if not valencia or newcastle united is a good team for him|`|zPCfcDXNaa	wereever he goes, it has to be a big club and make shure he gets playing time|`|qbPbvLuLaa	He deserves to be in a better club|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	it'd b bad azz if Guardado nd G.

Just think of India without Khan bowling (though Mills is probably even better, especially in NZ conditions).  Elliott will probably also return who was in great form in Aus.  Perhaps Oram may return to the bowling crease.  The return of say Tendulker may not be nearly as big a deal for India.  Tendulkar was no good last time, and has not had any practice (after Indian cricket board had their little bit of input).  So he will not be adjusted.  I honestly beleive that for a tour to NZ Dravid may have been an option.  He is technically capable of handling NZ conditions.

Good skaters know how to skate backwards. Anyways, Keep you feet shoulder with apart and knees bent, keep your back strait or you will fall forwards cause bending your knees will make you lean forwards to far. Then cut C's into the ice with each foot. and then just skate.|`|hL4ETg0iaa	Stand on the ice with your feet forming a kind of ^-shape, that is, with your toes touching and the heels apart with your knees almost touching each other. <br>  Put your weight on the front part of your feet, then use your knees to help push yourself backward on your inner blades. Your legs will be pushed apart. <br>  When your feet are about half a meter apart, bring your heels closer together to form a "V" shape. <br>  Repeat this alternating pattern of "^" and "v" to form the "hourglass" shape. <br>  When you can do this, you can practice and eventually learn to do it with more flow.|`|5xG69Mjtaa	Its actually pretty easy.  Some tips may be, to bend knees slightly more, keep weight on front balls of your feet when pushing off (feet slightly ahead of you), generating more push with outer side of foot as you move it behind you. With anything practice makes perfect.|`|RKoMl7xSaa	1.Put your feet into a 'V' position with your toes touching and your heels   pointing outwards.<br>  2. push your feet out to the side<br>  3. pick one foot up and put it back into the middle<br>  4. pick the other foot up and put it back into the middle <br>  repeat 3 and 4 a lot<br>  <br>  the faster you put your foot back the faster you will move!
23bs0kAKaa	No do NOT show off :P its kinda a turn off, just hold her up and if she is a faller then you have it made, as she is falling, you catch her, and look into her eyes, then "Do you want to go out with me" she will be flustered and flattered all at once, if she says yes pick her up, if she says no, let her fall :P (jokes about the last part) <br>  <br>  If you want to, you can show off JUST A BIT nothing major and dont go more than 5-10 feet away at any time, so NO full tilt around the ice. Just a pivot here and there, little little little things :) good luck and good idea, can be very romantic if done right :)|`|X8TnpmXGaa	You definetly dont need to show off skills. If a girl is not very good at ice skating and sees you doing really well, she may actually feel bad cause she cant skate as well as you.<br>  <br>  By not being very confident on skates, it may comfort her to know that she is not the only one struggling. This only works if she is not very good at ice skating. <br>  <br>  If I were trying to pick up a girl while ice skating, I would probably skate along side her and complement her on how well she is doing on ice skates. This can break the ice (figuatively), and spark a conversation. Next, after a little small talk, you can introduce yourself (if you havn't already met) and ask if you cant buy her a drink or something at the rink. Hopefully things can progress from there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3y8YIs3raa	skate up to her dont make her feel like your showing off talk if she likes you she will get talking and hit it from there :]
T2UZXarLaa	if youre planning on this being a one time thing then ski.

You're going to have the same learning curve with snowboarding down the road anyway.  Start with snowboarding and stick with snowboarding.  Its harder to learn but believe me its worth it because its a ton of fun when you develop advanced skills.  Skiing is only for those that are too old or are not in good enough physical condition to snowboard|`|8YfnjvExaa	I would think you should start with skiing if you are a beginner, I think it is easier to make progress, so you'll feel better. It's also more versatile to learn how to use skis (you could try cross-country with skis which you can't really do on a snowboard). If you fancy snowboarding, you can try it later. That's the way most people do it.<br>  <br>  Unless of course you are strongly drawn to snowboarding, in which case, go for it!

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Yes, you can. There are many models out there similar to a terrestial ( land based) metal detector. Here's a link to various models: <a href="http://www.aquaexplorers.com/metal_detecting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaexplorers.com/metal_detec...</a>|`|92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	Absolutely!  However, it does take a special metal detector that can withstand the water (and salt water - which is harsher than fresh.)  They are pretty pricey 1000-2500.  You also need to be an above average diver as you are task loading...  (there's enough going on when doing regular looking around diving.)  You still have to remember to check your air, know where you are going etc.  I think it works best in 2 person teams.  One uses the detector, the other watches out for them, and if the person hits on something, the second person can do a search for it.<br>  <br>  Also not that it matters, but that guy is hooka diving.  It's where the air is coming either from a tank or an air compressor on the surface.  He's attached to a long hose!  This is as opposed to being a self contained scuba diver.  (with the gas in a tank on your back.)

a1D8qfO4aa	First watch some people go off and see where they start from to hit the jumps and how many turn or speed check they take before hitting it. Once you firgure this out do what they do but when you come to the jump stay centered over your ski's bend your knees and at the end of the jump "pop" its kinda like standing up but not really hard to explain. In the air keep your hands forward but no like in the air cause you will just look dumb. Stay centered look for your landing, land centered and you should have no problems. Take speed don't slow down a lot or else you will land flat and that hurts take enough so you land on the steep part of the landing and you should be fine|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Really the only time your knees shouldn't be bent while skiing is when doing a stiffy or a rocket air. When hitting jumps, you want to keep your knees slightly bent, hands in front and shoulders, knees and toes in a fairly straight line balanced over your skis. Don't lean back on the jump or you'll be off balance in the air. Once you reach the lip of the jump, pop up and then start looking for the landing. Keep your hands in front of you while in the air or you'll start to lean back and crank up the windows. Its always a good idea to check out the jump and landing before hitting it to determine the amount of speed needed to hit the landing. You always want to land on a downhill slope to minimize risk of injury.
