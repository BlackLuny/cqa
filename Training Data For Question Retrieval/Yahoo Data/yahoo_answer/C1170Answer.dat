You are one of very few women that are naturally beautiful. I think you look good w/o make-up. Don't try to look older, it is an honor to look young. I always did and still do at 41.

ocwetmQuaa	Hair turns gray because the cells in the hair loses melanin.  That's where the color comes from.  The cells become filled with air, which is colorless, and the hair appears to be gray.|`|c2uEs18eaa	Grey hairs do grow in, so you would see it grey from the root and natural the rest of the way.

TORBP6QIaa	You can do the essential bits of a pedicure at home.  Get a pumice stone or ped-egg or foot-file to remove the rough skin from your feet then apply a really creamy rich moisturiser to your feet.  Creams made especially for feet often have urea in them and these work even better than regular cream.  Paint your toenails a pretty colour and voila!...you are ready to flash your feet again!<br>  It may take a week or two of dedicated care but your feet will get soft and gorgeous again.|`|kmDjud0Maa	Get a pedicure with a parrifin wax dip- you will love your feet afterwards!|`|eqmaJlrlaa	Get a new pair!<br>  <br>  J/k<br>  <br>  You can buy the Ped Egg sold at most retail stores like walmart or target. Walgreens and CVS have them too. It costs only $10 and shaves the dry and dead skin off your feet and feels really nice. <br>  <br>  After you shave the dead skin off, use Vitamin E oil or lotion with Vitamin E and Aloe Vera on your feet. If you want, now that it's cold, you can lotion up your feet and then put on a pair of socks before bedtime. If you do this every night for about 2 weeks to a month, your feet will stay moisturized and soft. Just remember to shave your feet about every 2 weeks because the dry and callous skin grows back.<br>  <br>  Wearing shoes instead of open toed slippers or flip-flops every day will help.<br>  <br>  I have the same problem because I like to slip into a pair of flip-flops sandals instead of tie on shoes. This procedure works for me.|`|rN7pm9xGaa	well, first off, use foot creams. It will cure your dry and rough feet. Make sure to use it to regularly to show promising results. Over time, your feet will become more smooth and less dry. To avoid blister, you may want to not wear heels or flats that are either big or small for you. It hurts real bad, trust me from experience. You may want to stop wearing heels and flats for some time so your feet can "heal". Hope I help. =)|`|SI5rWghCaa	at wal-mart or a drug store you can buy like cotton socks, then before you go to bed put cream on your feet (I use Aveeno) and then put the socks on. At first it will be uncomfortable cause your feet will feel cold, but you'll get use to it and it's worth it. And make sure you wash your feet in the shower with a soapy cloth. Then put some clear nail polish on your toes to make them look nice but natural.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps:)|`|Pi6hH6bUaa	Well all you have to do is put on lotion.I know why you have those blisters on your feet ,cause the shoes you wear!

msYaSuYzaa	You're not ugly!<br>  I think if you curl you hair it might look nice, and maybe getting contacts instead of glasses. Try layers too(like someone else said) and idk about makeup or anything(i don't wear it) but, trust me, your not ugly. And you really do have a nice smile ^_^|`|U17j4gFjaa	Girl do not let anyone call you ugly. I bet they got issues themselves. We all do. No one is happy with who we are, we always want more, look at the stars. Anyway, I need a make over myself, I try a new hairstyle every 6 months, highlights in the summer solid in the winter. Always start with the hair that is every girls first step and a must. You want to look fresh.  It is worth spending on.  Some layers and bangs would look cute, maybe a new set of frames check out this website www.ehow.com for more advice. I suggest you go to a prestigious salon where the hair stylists are stylish and look fabulous, do some local research in your area.  You look ethnic, I love the traditional clothing. I hope you don't wear that on a regular basis.. Try some fun t's comfortable stylish pants 7 for all Mankind sit well, for starters. Good luck!|`|ito0aUM1aa	You are NOT ugly.  Any person will look attractive if he/she has good skin, hair and teeth.  In your case, you have to style your hair, get hair treatment.  Lose the eyeglasses, it makes you look older.  Try contacts.  Trim your eyebrows. Do something with your teeth, maybe put some lingual braces on, it's invisible but effective. Apply make up that enhances the color of your skin.<br>  <br>  BTW, you're even prettier than your friend. But shhh!dont tell her i said that. LOL!|`|pQrhKfwjaa	hmm...maybe<br>  get contacts and curl your hair a bit, that would look good.and maybe some light makeup, as in like just lip gloss and mascara. something like that|`|FGCydEKeaa	Your not even ugly.<br>  <br>  |`|VcmeGKDJaa	aww no! don't listen to them! their messed up.. put a little makeup on and you'll look very pretty =D<br>  |`|KVHtWENnaa	your not ugly!<br>  just wear some makeup, i dunno.|`|SDSmotQiaa	aw no you're not ugly!<br>  for hair, maybe you could cut it in layers or something...that would give it some volume and bounce. <br>  maybe you could try getting new glass frames, or contacts. |`|s68Fp10Kaa	you are not ugly, you have a very nice smile, maybe you can wear lip gloss to bring attention to your smile.|`|YMYOgOBjaa	Contacts might help and dont listen to the first person that answered! that jim d guy|`|etWY35Z8aa	well ur not ugly<br>  but u could always improve<br>  et contacts,<br>  lip gloss,<br>  try wearin ur hair diff.|`|BT5yjNJmaa	are you indian??? ummm u can lose the glasses get contacts and put on some make up because u look like ur 8 lol

I don't like the look of fake tans or people who go from snow white skin (like me) to super dark where you can't even tell it's them anymore. Plus it causes nasty sun spots and possible skin cancer in the future. The only tanning I reccommend is a slight fake bake. Nothing too drastic; just to give you a little color. But I prefer my natural pale skin tone.|`|2763f0a0822008cfdb6744a7d11c0f35aa	Nothing wrong at all!!

1IgrRnEvaa	yep your sure can and it is very common...my hairstylist always does it.  ask  yours and they can help you pick out colors that would look best. i think different shades of brown look best on brown hair.  maybe its me but brown hair with blonde highlights just looks so fake!  prob will only run you 70-100 with cut, which is pretty reasonable

Have fun!! |`|3jLpMrpNaa	try using just eyemake up and lip makeup. im sure you dont need foundation since you have nice young skin! a little bit of black mascara on the top lids. brown mascara on the bottom. some lipgloss or your choice. that should look lovely. also a light shade of eyeshadow. it will look very nice on you and young. have fun, makeup is always fun. also if you are going out at night, to mix it up alittle just darken up the eyeshadow, and try a little bit of eyeliner on the top lid. (not to dark!) have fun with it!!

But if your truly bored with it, I would go for a dark brown. No highlights, darks look good on you. Possibly a bit shorter, but no more than two inches. The frame of your face is good for long hair. |`|AA10954497	Your hair looks really good, how about going a little shorter, but nothing drastic.|`|s76aC4G8aa	With black hair you cannot add highlights, well not blond highlights you could go with a reddish highlight but I don't think you need it.  Your hair is gorgeous and it suits you as it is, I would suggest going shorter but nothing drastic, you could cut 5 inches off and still have a good amount of hair.  If you cut it shorter it will feel and look a lot thicker.  This is something that should be discussed with a hair stylist a good one that will discuss your hair length, thickness and what your best option would be.  I like the side bang look but I also feel that whispy or actual bangs would suit you.<br>  <br>  Go shorter but I wouldn't do anything drastic, you look fine the way you are.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RDXeR28Faa	Nooooo don't change anything! You look really cute with curly hair in my opinion just stick with that!|`|oBdlGYukaa	do not chop that hair its beautiful and suits you great. maybe do some highlights or put in some streaks of color. |`|UpcsIT0Maa	well you are so pretty you could be bald and still look good|`|yXPVKIvMaa	Forget the side bangs it is so 10 minutes ago heheeh. If you're really looking for a good change get eye-skimming bangs that gradually slide into layers on the side. <br>  <br>  You may color your hair a deep red like auburn or black/red (wine red), or currant shades....as long as you stick with deep, rich colors, because those go best with your olive skin.<br>  <br>  As for the length, try a shoulder-length like cindy margoli's (of E!) last year. Sort of like layers starting near the roots and then cascading downwards so that you have fine chunks of hair at the bottom part (kind of like scene hair, but not over the top)... I think this shorter length would look particularly fresh on you, and it will really highlight your gorgeous features rather than hide them.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|FVMcBP2Qaa	The natural color of your hair looks really good on you, so I wouldn't suggest changing that.  The length is good too, but it could be shorter if you're sick of dealing with it.

I think you should be happy with your skin tone. There's no need to be like them. If you want to copy their makeup style you can do the following steps:<br>  <br>  1. Get their contact lenses - they're called Geo or Dueba. They'll give you that "anime" big eyes look<br>  <br>  2. In addition to that the girls curled their lashes and add mascara<br>  <br>  3. Lastly they line their waterline with white pencil liner.|`|vZNWj6NWaa	if you dont go into the sun much you wont tan and then youre skin is more pale..<br>  <br>  I cant tan very well so im really pale like that<br>  <br>  Foundation isnt used to make you  look paler/tanner its used to even out your skin tone (like if you have alot of freckles or if you have alot of red flush in your cheek/forehead) it can also hide acne pretty well.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	girl first of all be happy with your skin type...okay??? the only way you would be whitter is you do what michael jackson did....but don't. anyway foundation is a concealer...to help conceal blemishes and to even out your skin to into one color skin.

EGlSesYjaa	Your hair is already streaked platinum and you seem to already have warm gold undertones. I think tinting it Auburn, or putting is some raspberry or warm reddish colored streaks would look gorgeous. <br>  <br>  Streaking a color like this in:<br>  <a href="http://www.hairstylediva.com/Young%20girl%20with%20long%20fine%20red%20hair,%20wearing%20black%20dress.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylediva.com/Young%20gir...</a><br>   <br>  Or maybe even this as a general color (top two):<br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2005/gallery/hairstylewatch/llohan.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2005/ga...</a>|`|ST8SqDZzaa	I think blond is defiantly the way to go!<br>  Do it!|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Yes you would but better in brown and you can get eyebrow dye or have it done at the hair dresser,i do my own ,i put a cream around the eyebrow top and botton then i use a mascara brush and brush it on,leave it for 15 min and wash off reapply if needed.|`|UHjXC1Jhaa	You're already are blond?

t9jcDBakaa	It's true that it helps doing it after a shower or a bath, but putting a little moisturizer on the area I found has really helped for me. The best choices are to apply to the brow Anbesol, Orajel or any teething gel for babies if you can, and definately exfoliate beforehand.|`|e5acb3af51b48dae1a6445da769c1569aa	put some ice on the area before you pluck, to numb it.|`|Gh8918f1aa	Use cream on your eyebrows, there is one to soothe the skin before you wax or pluck. Put pressure in the area your plucking and rub around it a bit after you finish plucking.|`|0ea532f4f64dbcab2fea6b950194850aaa	Well you could try ice <br>  <br>  Or you could also look for a topical anesthetic at the drugstore - any ointment or cream containing lidocaine, prilocaine, or benzocaine, although there have been some studies done saying that frequent use of these products is not good for you. <br>  <br>  I suggest going to a salon to get your eyebrows waxed - or if you have an indian threading salon nearby that's even better - these methods of hair removal are still a bit painful (although you adapt to it over time so it hurts much less) but they are better for pain than plucking because they remove all of the hairs at once as opposed to plucking each single hair one by one. So instead of prolonged pain its really just a quick instant. Plus going to a professional means more accurate shaping and better results. <br>  <br>  Goodluck! (the things we do to be beautiful...) |`|G2w8Dgtsaa	you should do it when pores are open so when you have got out of the shower or bath, also pull the skin tight and pull in one quick tug, this will reduce the pain!<br>  <br>  Main pain killing tip = pulling skin tight |`|xNAFM9x1aa	You get used to it after a while. One thing i used to do though is pluck straight after a shower when you pores are open. Relatively painless and the hairs come out quite easily|`|MpBPxZ0Taa	You get used to it really.. well its painful for the first like 2-3 times .. afterward.. its nothing special:)<br>  You could use ice indeed..and relax when you do it ..being tense makes it worse.|`|yP8qwk0Saa	It does suck, but you get used to it. I've been plucking my eyebrows for four years already and I'm used to the pain. I've also found that plucking the top is WAY less painful than plucking from the bottom, so that's what I do.<br>  <br>  You could also use one of those mini eyebrow shavers to shave the part you want gone instead of plucking it.

To manage it better, be sure you have a haircut longer than shoulders so in emergency cases you can do a pony tail.<br>  <br>  At night try to wrap it around your head, that gives you softness and manageable way.

MOjgn0Glaa	Brown hair with blue eyes. To die for. Enough said, I think.<br>  <br>  Actually, I should explain.. Brown hair or any shade darker than blonde looks so attractive, it's so unique and the dark hair gives a sense of dark sort of broodiness and the blue eyes stand out and it gets framed. You get stuck on features like that.. I think brown hair and blue eyes is the best look, no doubt. You hardly see it too, it's a real shame.<br>  <br>  By the way, did you know brown hair is a dominant trait in genes to all hair colours and blue eyes is recessive to brown eyes. I wish I had blue eyes!! You are extremely lucky.|`|iYAUq0DWaa	Its defineartly genetically rarer :] But I have it naturally too really dark brown hair.

But a smile would help.|`|Hsald88Taa	hunni, after looking at ur pic i have 2 suggestions for you.<br>  <br>  1. get highlights/foils all over your entire hair, to lighten u up a bit. it wont be blonde blonde, but will make u lighter all over.<br>  <br>  then, next visit to the hairdressers, get her/him to give u some brighter blonde streaks. just so it looks natural over time.<br>  <br>  as your hair is so dark, it wont go really blonde the first time, and u dont want to damage your hair, especially as ur trying to grow it.<br>  <br>  2. buy some thick clip in blonde extensions- chunky blonde underneath would look hot on you.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|YfK76B6xaa	Not blonde, but a lighter shade than what you have no will be fine. The stylist should know what looks good, but def not blonde it would look to unnatural. You want subtle highlights not streaks.|`|jV2NvfpGaa	No, you have fair skin and dark hair. Highlights won't look good. I suggest you straighten it, and let it grow out.

I definitely love it on my body, but like I said I'm still "testing" it on my face to make sure it doesn't cause my skin to break out, etc. So far so good though.|`|s4psKJrPaa	ok well my friend gave me Biore balancing moisturizer(the oil free one), and i LOVE it!!! it makes my skin look great! and its really inexpensive too!|`|iCRPmKU6aa	Clean and Clear dual action moisturizer<br>  Clinique dramactically different lotion or gel

Well, I really don't think you should rely on modeling as a career ( cause unless you're a supermodel it's just not a reliable job and you can't work as a model for very long ) but I think you're really pretty and you shouldn't give up on modeling, but make sure to have a backup plan though ^.~ Good luck!

aKEo11Csaa	I'm a hairstylist, And I personally think anyone can pull off side bangs. It all depends on the type of hairstyle you'd like to have though, Straight bangs aren't any harder to manage, I mean they kinda just fall into place, for most people anyways. It mostly depends on the style you're looking to get. <br>  <br>  Also; Any hairstylist should be able to do side bangs.<br>  <br>  |`|KvEpmHLJaa	Side bangs were in at the beginning of this year.

BUT if I get them soft and feathered... it's beautiful. Don't go for such a heavy bang if you get them straight. Get them soft and airy, kinda wisp. It works so well. And keep them long, that way you can do sideswept too. I'd so don't go any shorter than your eyebrows. :)|`|Dp7hqufzaa	side bangs they are sooo hot. i have them... if ur and older woman get front, front bangs make u look older, and side bangs make u look older|`|cgO5PviRaa	Strait across bangs will make your forehead look even wider.  A long bang that is actually a little longer at the sides would be better for your face.  To cut the type of bangs I'm talking about start with damp hair.  Section off bangs according to how heavy you want them to be.  Comb the hair down and to the center so it is right over your nose.  Cut at about the tip of your nose...you can always cut it shorter later, but remember that your hair will be shorter once it dries and you are not pulling it down.  Cut all of the bangs at once right over the tip of your nose.  It will end up a little below your eyebrows once it dries.  If its getting in your eyes too much you can repeat the process only a little shorter.  The finished product will be similar to strait across bangs, but will be a little longer tward the sides and frame your face.  Looks really nice with blunt cut hair or face framing layers and since they are still a bit long you can sweep them to the side if you want...really cute with a cool bobbypin.  Here's approximately what they will look like.<br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/bangswelove/ss/celebbangs_4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/bangswelove/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/bangswelove/ss/celebbangs_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/bangswelove/s...</a><br>  You don't have to make them as heavy as the ones in the pics though.

W91X0Lfvaa	If you wear makeup.. I know this might sound crazy, but mix a little bit of white cream makeup in with your foundation, but use just a tiny bit more foundation than white makeup.<br>  <br>  And the white makeup I'm talking about is the kind that you get in tubes from costume/halloween shops, it'll make you just a little bit more pale without looking like you just slapped white cream on yourself.<br>  <br>  I think there's a makeup brand called Stargazer too that has a white face powder made just for making you look paler.. I think it might be kind of expensive though so I've never really looked into it but I've heard of a lot of people using it.<br>  <br>  I'm naturally tan and sometimes I hate being tan so I just try to stay indoors as much as I can and wear a high SPF sunscreen when you do have to be outside for more than a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Other than that I don't really know any ways to make your skin permanently lighter without bleaching.|`|AA11223319	"Vampirish"<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Not the best word to use.<br>  <br>  Anywho.

tJIdBatQaa	Most responsible piercers wont perform more than 2 piercings on you in the same day, so obviously it is not a good idea to do it.

Yjn1T4mNaa	I do.<br>  <br>  I paid $20 for mine, but it was at a place that charges half price on Mondays and Tuesdays. So anywhere between $20-60. They will probably pierce it with a plain silver stud. That's what I got. I'm sure that if you ask they might have some diamond studs they can put in instead. It doesn't really hurt that bad. All there really is at first is a little bit of pressure, and then a small bit of stinging afterward. It really isn't a problem at all. I think you should have it done on your left side.<br>  <br>  Also, and this is important: be sure that they put a long enough bar in your lip to accommodate for the swelling. The woman didn't put a long enough one in, and my lip swole a lot and nearly started growing/sinking into my lip. It was very painful until they changed it to a longer bar. Anyways, just clean the outside of it with anti bacterial soap and water afterwards. You'll probably want to rinse your mouth out with warm water and a SEA salt solution (Don't get regular table salt, it won't work) to help the inside heal faster. And don't worry if it stays swollen fora few days, unless you aren't cleaning it, then it probably isn't infected. Oh, and don't put a plastic retainer in it until it is fully healed though, because plastic carries more bacteria.<br>  <br>  Happy piercing! :)|`|FOCpoUZpaa	4.

Your mouth will numb itself though i did faint a few time so make sure you eat first. it does feel really weird after like sort of fuzzy and they use a needle so prepare yourself. it dont hurt much though so good luck if you get it done. mine cost ￡20 btw.
67a1ff58b604e3d3b5964c83c09f9583aa	Get a really strong setting lotion like Lottabody or Wella Elan in extra strenth from Sally's Beauty and have someone roll it on red perm rods like they were giving you a perm.  You will need it to dry naturally (around 8 hrs) or under a hooded dryer.  This will be as close as you can get without doing a chemical.  If you don't know anyone to roll it for you then a beauty school will do it for pretty cheap just be sure they use a really strong setting lotion and it could last for a week.|`|3a7c4082bc6529444ce2f163a91f1f79aa	Get a Wig!

hYZhZHzmaa	highlights in your hair would  be good just make sure it blends with your hair but in a way it sticks out lighter or darker. and i dont know if want make up advice to but i think you should wear some dark shades of eye shadow, dark grey, purple, or shimmer green. it'll bring out your eyes. thick eyeliner? maybe oh and if you dont like thick eye liner how about making your eye liner dark but thin :)|`|vHeTbN3Oaa	Ok you have a great body, beautiful eyes and nice skin and your hair is just fine maybe a little shine needed, please dont do brown and blonde highlights...try brown and carmel highlights you don't want your hair too have the "skunk" effect as they call it. lol however, i see one little mistake that would really improve your look as far as face...<br>  I want to say it nicely, your pretty but girl you over tweezed your eyebrows! you took them too in...look in the mirror hold a pencil parallel to the side of your nose..your eyebrows should start there....trust me once you grow them out you will look soo good....its the space in between them that is too wide...hope I helped :) |`|g9QHFM49aa	i would dye your hair lighter brown, and highlights would look AMAZING!!<br>  kindaa lik a miley cyrus look<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/miley%20cyrus%20red%20dress/mileyashleyabercrombielover/bgs%20i%20made%2002/mileybimadecutereddress000000000000.jpg?o=4" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/miley...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and maybe experiment with some makeup <3|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Don't go with the black make up (Not a good look)<br>  Thin out those eyebrows ,a fringe maybe and some highlights.|`|8MDFKrrfaa	Blonde would be cute.|`|VC5oD3kjaa	dye your hair light brown, get some bangs and wear less eyeliner on the bottom lid and you'll be prettier :)|`|VTD5ljXvaa	Your eyebrows need to be done !!!! fix your hair color.....Comb your hair......never do that again..... mmm your shirt....needs to go. sorry you asked |`|53R43zLGaa	it looks like u pluck ur eyebrows majorly <br>  very unnatural|`|yueqzqWmaa	ur cute as is ;)|`|5eb76628e118c55cf3691b2b7b6a3cabaa	just fix your hair and eyebrows..is that your sister beside you you both kind of resemble each other<br>  |`|ygNX1mi5aa	pluck ur eyebrows to make them longer. ur beautiful! and dye youre hair if you want but i like it|`|TTIJW2zzaa	well i think your beautiful, u shouldn't worry at all. and im not just saying that to be nice.|`|ytdhoE24aa	honestly, try highlights in your hair|`|tmCA6jdSaa	just fix your hair better it looks too messy  like you don't care   do it more like the girl sitting by you or if you are going to wear it up at least smooth it down and get rid of all the sharks in it but other than that you are really pretty|`|UeDGiKSyaa	It looks like you shave your eyebrows.

Maybe like the girl next to you in the picture. Personally, I really dislike when girls clip their bangs on top of their head, it's very unappealing and doesn't always make the hair frmae the face well. Your hair looks like it gradates naturally (unless you dyed it already?) so I don't see a point in you dying it.  Try letting your bangs down, and if they hang over your eyes, trim them. <br>  <br>  Also, the eyeliner is a little dark, try experimenting with lighter shades. <br>  <br>  Just my two cents|`|XzsmYWOqaa	Get yourself a really good flat iron, like a Hai or Chi<br>  <br>  Get your eyebrows done by a professional.  You are a pretty girl, but your eyebrows look kinda weird<br>  <br>  Change your fashion style, more classy.  The outfit looks kinda EMO-ish, not cute.<br>  <br>  Other than that...<br>  you are a pretty girl.  Don't make yourself ugly with a weird style.|`|8qnmMJNXaa	Get your eyebrows done professionally. Lighten your hair to a dirty blond and add extensions in layers. And invest in a good straigtener (I use the Chi it's amazing). And don't put black eyeliner under your eye, put it on that part of your eye on top of the lower eyelashes, if you know what I mean.|`|t6HeqNnPaa	I bet if your had your hair caramelized that would look really good on you ( that's where they color different layers of hair different colors)|`|hZT7vM9Faa	Maybe bangs.  But I would do you either way.|`|qvfEdfagaa	nothing your pretty enough maybe the highlight would look better though|`|J36Rc5DKaa	having me next 2 u, would make u look way better, lol|`|bOduFl9Baa	just straighten your hair
Taah0mLcaa	my friend got her snakebites pierced a month or so ago, and hers stayed swollen for not even a week, but she had the same problem with not being able to se the back. she just made sure to use mouthwash and everything and it went down now they look amazing ;)|`|YMbBFdi9aa	I have a manroe, Ive had mine for like 3 and a half years, when i first got mine pierced the lady said make sure i keep ice on it so it dosnt swell, and if it swells to much then it may swoll over the backs and you will have to get them removed at the hospital. you should call the place where you got them peirced and if the continue to swell ice your lips and Make sure you rince with sea salt!!! <br>  good luck!|`|aXqtzNIraa	Swelling can last up to 7 days, if you're worried about the bar then you should go back to your piercer, if it's too short it needs to be changed!<br>  <br>  To help you should take ibuprofen, it'll reduce swelling and help with any pain. You might find certain foods soothing, ice cream, frozen yoghurt and sucking on ice cubes.<br>  <br>  and of course cleaning as you will have been told when getting pierced.|`|nTSjPOYQaa	It sounds like you don't have a long enough stud in. You should continue to take care of your piercing and keep an eye on it until you can get yourself back to the piercer. If the stud isn't long enough, they can insert a new one for you.

gxdej2deaa	psoriasis|`|3cfad5533a98651b2dd4386a45b012ebaa	If it's on your face, it's more like eczema. Psoriasis does not commonly occur on the face.<br>  <br>  The good news is that neither eczema nor psoriasis is contagious although it's believed there are genetic components. My mother has severe psoriasis but none of her children have it. Eczema is thought by some to be linked to the mother's diet during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Either way, there are creams and medicines that can dramatically reduce symptoms or even make them disappear. Consult your doctor to make sure what it is. He or she will be able to recommend treatment.|`|XqfH76PMaa	Quit using that face wash and see if it goes away.  You can also put lotion on it for a few days and see if that helps.  It is not contagious so don't worry about that.  If it does not clear up, you may want to see you doctor and see what he/she says about it.  I wouldn't worry, it is probably just dry skin and will go away in a few days.|`|oitBHlSdaa	i have phsorisis, and no you probley dont have it. But I would suggest oil. like dry skin oil. Lotions usually dont help. And no its not contagious, its something thats in your jeans. but of couse see your family doctor for a better diagnosis|`|CebL2caqaa	no

4fgISyZ8aa	It's adorable as long as you have the right shoes. It's def not too formal. It's a little more classy and there's nothing wrong with looking fierce at school. Some people just weren't meant to wear jeans and tees all the time.|`|kHas4mq4aa	i think if you wore like a simple zip-up hoodie or leggings or something to tone it down... but alone i think it's a little much for school.|`|n4zqSQJaaa	yeah way  formal if its a regular day why where a dress in the fall any how?.maybe if it was a spacial occasion.|`|rJdfVtwqaa	no its definately not too formal.<br>  i would totally wear it to school! :]|`|JDQP0Phraa	Not too formal at all.

Nothing screams "formal" about it.<br>  <br>  Then again, my idea of casual and formal is a lot different than most teens. My idea of bumming it for a day is skinny jeans and a hoodie lol|`|QP9aVgbtaa	not at all. you'll definetley look cuter than everyone and you'll get tons of compliments. people at my school dress up all the time, and so do i =]|`|TyFoi2ONaa	I think that it's fine it's adorable actually.

F1cMkH2Caa	yes it does i'm not sure how fast but i think your natural color is best so you don't go two tone|`|AA10375363	copper|`|aAU6kNqwaa	Ah, I can definitely help with this!<br>  <br>  I just recently started dreading my own hair, they are about 4 months old now : )<br>  <br>  My hair was half way down my back when I started, now it's at my shoulders!  It makes sense when you think about it, the hair gets all tangled up so it gets SIGNIFICANTLY shorter.  At some point the length of your hair quits shrinking (it's a different amount of time for everyone) and it grows at a pretty normal rate, as someone else mentioned it's certainly not faster; I might even say because the new growth ends up getting tangled it will take longer for the length of the new growth to show when you get dreadlocks.  <br>  <br>  As for color, it really depends on your exact skin tone, I've seen light skinned people with every shade from white to black to any color of the rainbow in between, if you like the color for your normal hair it shouldn't be any different with dreadlocks!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!  If you need any advice on how to start them let me know, I'd be happy to help!|`|NYcZsPE7aa	dreads are your natural hair, just knotted up. why would that make it grow faster?<br>  <br>  best color is whatever color your hair already is
b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	yeah, I think if you lke what you see hten you should be confident!|`|VgOMPY7Zaa	i think i have some looks haha. my mom taught me at a young age: no matter how skinny you are or how big you are, no matter how beautiful or ugly. your beauty shines through your skin and makes you, You!|`|nyQMDwWYaa	Yes!|`|BDlM6387aa	i think so<br>  im very cute and have great dark blue eyes<br>  and great hair :)|`|GerC2sF2aa	Yes!

8amE3jyTaa	the tinted moisturizer is a great way to both even out your skin tone a bit and also provide moisturization. that product i totally agree with. <br>  <br>  as for the powder dust the powder after you've finished all the rest of your makeup, as this will set the look. use pressed powder since loose powder makes the makeup seem heavier (if you're already doing so, stick with it). <br>  <br>  i have nothing against grooming and setting your brows, since brows are the frame of your eyes and are equally as important. <br>  <br>  shadow and mascara i agree with. for a more natural look with the shadow, go with light neutrals (maybe a vanilla or cream color) with a bit of sparkle in it for fun. <br>  <br>  use a brown-black mascara instead of an all black (unless you have black hair to begin with) mascara to tone the makeup down. <br>  <br>  skip the liner, since this is one of the causes of that heavy makeup look. if you don't want to skip liner, don't use black. instead use a brown liner for blue, gray, green, or hazel eyes and a blue or green liner for brown eyes (this will help accentuate your eye color best). after applying liner, soften the line with a cotton swab, or if you have a smudger that comes with the liner, use that to blend the line. this will make the look seem softer.  <br>  <br>  blend the blush a bit more so you only have a hint of color on your cheeks.<br>  <br>  for the lipstick, try blotting it with a tissue after applying it. this will tone down the color a bit.|`|211096325222495a1ff2d253221512a8aa	i think that it's all in the application.  It's good that you use a tinted moisturizer instead of a heavy foundation.  try applying powder with a brish instead of a puff.  only do brows if you really need it, and if you do, keep it light and natural.  use light or neutral shadows. try using brown eyeliner instead of black to avoid being harsh.  mascara should be fine as long as you don't apply "spider" lashes.  don't use a lot of blush. and try a lip gloss in a light pink or peach instead of a lipstick.  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|50leR5XGaa	Chances are, the colors that you are choosing may be a little harsh for your skin tone.  I also find that tinted moisturizers or bronzers appear fake looking on someone with extremely light skin.  You may want to choose lighter colors, for instance if you are using a black eyeliner, you may want to switch to a brown, and the shadow color that you choose should be the opposite of your eye color.  For instance, if you have blue eyes you may want to use a reddish tinted shadow, and make sure to always use a brush, don't use those little swab things that come in the package.  Good luck!|`|Xsf5HF5Eaa	: tinted moisturizer, powder, brows... so far it sounds good, now for shadow you can use a creambase something natural with a lil shimmer, im not sure where exactly your applying your liner but if your putting it on your eyelid try to go thin.. as thin as you can go. if your applying it in the inner bottom of your eyes.. then just try not to go too thick!... now for mascara. dont put too much just a swipe in the middle then the inner and finally the outer of the eyes lashes...with your brush swipe the blush and shake some off and apply to your cheek bones! and  and finally go for glosss instead of lipstick.. try a pinkish tan color..if you think you have too much glos on then fold a piece of paper and insert it between your lips and press down softly...<br>  i hope this helps and didn't get you confused!<br>  <br>  Good LUCK ! <br>  <br>  hope you get the advice you needed!<br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|AA10743654	try not using eyeliner, just mascara, and i'm pretty sure you could probably do with out the brow gel.  Also try a pale pink LIPGLOSS instead of lipstick.|`|i29krWKPaa	I would just try minimal makeup...I know what u mean because no makeup at all is not an option for me either. My routine is a tint foundation (Prescriptives traceless), powder, a bit of bronzer, eyeliner, and clear mascara. I think for a more natural day look you should keep doing what you're doing just minimize it by cutting out the blush, shadow, brow gel, and lipstick. Just dust on some bronzer, but be careful to not put too much since you have pale skin and try a nice lip tints like the ones clinique has. Hope this helps!|`|niIcwFW3aa	im 13 too. lipstick looks to old for me i like lipgloss and its nice, young looking. everything si great but me personally loose the brow gel, eventhough it depends it you have a thicker browl. i dont wear blush and if i do its very light pink and i put put a small amount. its good to look natural but you really want your eyes to pop, i put a thin amount of green liner on my eyelid (the color you use depends on the color of your eyes) use black mascara and either a black eyeliner or the color of your eyes liner. if you pale make sure your skin does not get orange just put on a base/foundation and a light bronzer then rub in with hands. anything else your makeup routine sounds perfect.<br>  <br>  hope that helps, i want to be a makeup artist[=<br>  <br>  -anna|`|qOJsGL0Baa	I would do this:<br>  <br>  -Tinted Moisturizer<br>  - Powder<br>  - Eyeliner<br>  - a bit of Mascara<br>  - Lipgloss<br>  <br>  I think people go too far with eyeshadow and it makes their face look too strong.  How about this weekend just experiment with different ideas? Start out with 1 thing and work your way up.  See what you think makes you look too strong. Is your tinted moisturizer too dark for you? You may need a lighter shade. Dont use much eyeliner, make a THIN line instead of a thick line (if you dont already).  You can also try using a clear mascara. It will give you the same volume but it would look too overpowering. I would also leave out the blush .. instead try a Bronzer.  But be careful, being pale you have to try and find a very light bronzer and never use too much .. its only supposed to be a 'glow'.  I asked someone at my local makeup counter to help me out with a good bronzer for my skin tone (pale also).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|4f7b633b1cc1491cdcd568d3f9dd428aaa	you have to pick skin colors that look good in the light<br>  you can't judge on a line, you should judge on your skin tone eye color and other things<br>  also, blush and liner isn't totally necessary<br>  use a tinted lip gloss, and a shadow which is close to your skin color or the opposite color of your eyes<br>  using the op color of your eyes works like eyeliner, contrasting with your eyes<br>  blend the color in too though<br>  use mascara that lengthens but doesn't thicken<br>  that's as much information that i have

Use a BRAND NEW razor if possible!<br>  <br>  Use plently of shave gel/cream as well as baby oil, that helps. <br>  <br>  Buy a bottle of "witch hazel" you can find it right next to the rubbing alchohol at the store.

Te recomiendo las bicis de spin, son más caras pero te duran a?os y las estacionarias meses y la rueda y la resistencia no son resistentes.<br>  <br>  Ahora, empieza a calentar 5 minutos y poco a poco ve aumentando la velocidad y la resistencia y enfría 7 o 10 minutos antes. Durante ese tiempo no dejes de pedalear, es muy malo, sigue pedaleando hasta que ya estés fría y ya que has terminado has ejercicios de estiramiento con tus piernas. Esto mínimo 3 veces a la semana.|`|c82f6f0cc4cd517d91fd08d5b6489ca3aa	Es mejor una biclicleta en movimiento.. asi no sientes cuando tiempo pasa pork vas viendo nuevas cosas en el camino..1 hr al dia es super buena.|`|ce46a0c3417d569bd7097933ed136947aa	lo ideal es hacer 30 minutos  y luego otros ejercicios para conjugas con otros  y tendrás buenos resultados

I use Nourishair and Biotin and will soon be switching over to the ProCaps capsules because the GNC tabs are just too hard to swallow.<br>   If you want hair to grow faster, you have to take supplements that work on your body chemistry to support hair's growth and strength at its genesis.....once it has grown out, it is just dead keratin<br>  Try GNC, they make a supplement called "Nourishair" in formulas for men and women..they are HUGE pills and you have to take 2 daily. There is also a "Hair skin and nails" formula from Andrew Lessman that you can google, that has great ingredients and is easier to swallow, made by ProCaps labs. You can also take large doses of Biotin, sometimes called Vitamin H, take no less than 2500 micrograms daily to support healthy hair growth.

I don't think i've ever even known someone who had thier dress custom-made for prom...<br>  <br>  and if you still are not satisfied...another cheaper alternative than custom-making a dress is buying a dress and then having it altered...|`|c1ce117df846c167bc19a531098a5ea9aa	it's always better to have it made. it may a lil pricier, but worth it. you'll get a better fit & surely u wont end up having a twin that night.. lol! coz it usually happens...<br>  dont get ideas from prom / teens mag, coz it's the same banana - someone might have it too (but less chances). try looking at wedding mags (bridesmaid gowns/dress) & alter a lil bit. lets say- a lil accent on the shoulders or change the fabric. <br>  golden globe is also a good reference - its up to date!<br>  always remember: accessories & a good make up hair do will do the trick! <br>  go girl!|`|dc45fe49fb3908f574106e956a9aa2ddaa	If u can make it yeah go ahead.  why waste money when u can make ur own <br>  I hate 2 wear the same dress as someone else too.|`|uhhjbt1Baa	from my point of view of your situation, i would say to have your dress made<br>  <br>  1. its your own style, no one else will have it<br>  2. all of your dress ideas would come from you and what you are like.<br>  3. even if you buy it, then there would have to be a few adjustments made anyhow<br>  4. it will reflect your personality <br>  5.when you walk in the door all eyes will be on you <br>  6. guys will think that it is unique <br>  7. the most popular girls in school will notice you <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                                             greatest luck spencer|`|3tgZrXTAaa	The main question is solely up to you.  You should also consider the amount of time you have.  Start looking now for ideas if you want to get it made.

Usually that works and solves the problem of not having the same dress as other girls. But if you want to have a dress made go for it!. It would be unique. But also when all is said and done it will probably be cheaper to use your gas and go to a different city and buy one.
bc62a98e2bbce0c41d02162bacb3c10eaa	well USUALLY the clothes are knock offs. Because, the sellers buy wholesale clothes, which are fake. But, not always. If the seller has a good feedback score, the clothes might be real, but send them a question just to be sure. If they write back saying "We are not sure, because it is a supplier, etc." they are fake. Also look at pictures. If the pictures don't have the inside tag on them, or they look just the slightest different from the real thing, they are most likely fake.|`|6ffb57007617da7fff5c08cc0a0fa729aa	they are most likely fake.

Q8UydAW4aa	Definitely white, black, or tan. Not any of these weird colors that people are saying like yellow, green and stuff.

Light pink and white would also look good with brown, but it depends on what shade of brown it is.|`|B78YaVHyaa	Brown is a really nice colour which goes with evrthing becoz its neutral. Burnt orange, lime green, white, black, even a lighter/darker brown on brown will look really nice. Don't forget to accesorise! Belts, long necklaces and big earrings are really in right now so wear them well with your clothes. Also, it looks nice when your top and shoes match (trust me!)<br>  Good luck :P<br>  <br>  P.S try not to wear pale colours with brown as it makes your outfit look dead and you wont stand out. It looks very school-ish.|`|1u6fru3naa	If you have a solid brown skirt then I would wear it with a nuetral color like, white, cream or tan. Brown pretty much could go with anything though. I know I always wear my brown dress pants with a white button up dress shirt, and I think it looks cute. If your skirt has any other colors in it, then just match the shirt up to one of those colors. And I would go with a solid color shirt.|`|TWztIkA8aa	Wear a cream colored top.|`|qF1J9Fhraa	Black is always a safety net but try a bright blue, bubblegum pink or soft orange or green, which will keep it from looking old lady-like.|`|sRZchObZaa	Forest green typically looks best with brown. Also, light yellow is a very popular combination. Finally, sky blue may also work depending on the shade of brown!

AA12147779	well if its a dye and its perminate it will most likley be little affected, Shampooing strips your hair of its color.. so that could make it fad.. if you realy want your hair purple i think you should strip your hair of all the colors it has in it now (bleaching) then apply the dye.. it might act like a toner.<br>  I would suggest you get a proffesiional to do for optimum results|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	try dye blonde first.. and then dye purple...it will work cause need bright hair first then dark... cause dark dont work when they come first then bright.. it will not work good.. so try bright blonde hair first then dye purple..|`|FpHG9TrBaa	A few questions:<br>  <br>  What dye did you use?<br>  <br>  Special Effects Deep purple would be the best bet if you don't want to bleach your hair again.<br>  <br>  Is anything bleached at all?<br>  if anything is bleached the Special Effects Deep purple will cover it.<br>  <br>  How dark is dark?<br>  dark brown? black?<br>  <br>  A picture of your hair in it's current state would help.<br>  <br>  Is your hair fried?<br>  If it is, take a break a use a deep conditioner or a deep conditioning treatment.

The heat will open your hair shaft and let your hair absorb all the protein and mosturizers.<br>  <br>  One good thing about vegetable dyes (Manic Panic, Beyond The Zone, Special Effects, Directions)  is that they aren't damaging to your hair. If you're using one of those dyes, redying wont be the end of the world.|`|0la9t0TGaa	quit trying to dye your hair purple|`|192af0b16bc7a64f8e4126376b1487feaa	When you don't wash it out, then clumps stay in your hair and it gets everywhere.

It you use a dye that washes out then those usually work on dark hair.<br>  But you want semi/permanet dye.  The problem is with semi-permanet dye is that you'll keep having to dye it.

vxTZsLePaa	I know exactlly how you feel. you need more protein and iron in your diet or vitamins. I bought bumble and bumble seaweed shampoo and conditioner and it's helped my hair so much. B&B  are kinda expensive so if you can't afford them atleast find a protein rich shampoo and conditioner that will help with the thinness.

E67wp1XLaa	if your hair is dyed black, then yes, you'll still have to strip it out first. it doesn't matter how light you want to go. when you dye your hair, you can't then make it lighter without bleach. you CAN make it darker, but since your hair is already black, you have no choice but to strip it if you want something different.|`|Zmx40Nnpaa	Unfortunately, yes, because you're still going lighter.|`|0RIzlfGWaa	whenever you're going from black to something lighter you always have to bleach ur hair to get all the color out and then dying it the color you want... remember once you go black u can't turn back! hope this helps!! good luck!!!|`|NCjALI5Faa	That is going to be tough. You will need to get that done professonally. color doen's lift color, so you do need to strip it out. and then when it is stripped out it will be a red -orange. and that is when you would put a nice golden brown on it.|`|n0tNlMGiaa	honestly us red heads and people with black hair usually share simialr complexions, so i think that the reddish brown color would look awesome.

AA11176398	I don't know about the acne, but I can attest to it lightening your hair. If you have dark (brunette) hair, though, it will most likely turn it an orange shade.

This is a topical derivative of Vitamin A and it's effective at diminishing and erasing dark spots. It’s the best product against acne. Apply is at night and it will control the growth of new acne. You will see improvements within 3-4 days. It’s a fraction of that other product advertised on the TV (you know the one I’m talking about).<br>  <br>  For the hair...sorry I cannot comment, I have dark hair, but I would assume the lemon juice would also dry up your hair and leave it in a weak state...not a good idea in the summer.<br>  <br>  Gisele<br>  <a href="http://www.mybeautymatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybeautymatch.com</a>|`|AA10740893	To get rid of acne, <br>  Drink a lot of water, eat balanced meals, get exercise, take vitamins. Watch your diet...do you notice you break out after eating certain foods, if so cut them out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Q. Can you make your hair lighter by using lemon juice? <br>  <br>  A. Not exactly, Lemon juice by itself will not lighten the hair. Lemon juice AND the ultraviolet rays of the sun will lighten your hair. (Similar to a product called "Sun-In" ) The drawback here is dryness and if your is dark to begin with, it will turn orangutan orange! This job is better done by a professional. I also would like to suggest a "Weave". The weave (unlike the allover color) will not show such an extreme outgrowth line (dark roots). If you are already a dark blonde or very light brown you can probably use the lemon juice and sun method. Be sure to buy a really good "conditioning pac" for after. Also the lemon, sun method needs about 5 hours in the sun. (Not good for the skin so wear sun block!)|`|6W2TX7jYaa	Anna It will light ur hair but it will not get away acne. see u soon:)|`|737a5f955470b9338d808d270dc05d3baa	I know lemon juice will help with headaches. A friend of mine from India told me to mix it with a little warm water and drink it when I have a headache and I have to say it has worked. As for acne, I know that people are usually under the impression it is on the outside of your body but the underlying problem is usually on the inside. You can try some natural stuff, I will list the site below and you could read it. For lighting up your hair peroxide will do that. I have a dark blond hair color but in the summer from swimming in my pool it gets very blond. I usa a peroxide based chemical instead of chlorine and I do believe that is what makes my hair so blond in the summer.|`|kUOofAYraa	DO NOT PUT LEMON JUICE ON YOUR FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Please, this will only make your acne worse. trust me, i know from personal experience.  It will however lighten your hair.  this isn't a dye, it just lightens your hair naturally and softly...not completely, just a little to give great highlights that look natural.|`|AA11211049	Lemon juice will suck out all the oil from your face...not a good idea.<br>  <br>  For you acne, your dermatologist can prescribe Tretinoin/Tretinoid.

First use a clean paintbrush bigger works better for whole head smaller for streaks/highlights. Then paint it in where you want it then lay in the sun or near a bright light for a 30mins -1 hour (depenaning on the area of hair and amount of juice). Then it will last for 2-3 weeks. I use it too, it is cheaper then dye and will last longer if you use alot. Also orange juice does the trick. Good luck! Also it will not turn your hair orange!!!|`|HUqKp6Faaa	OMG OMG OMG......i know excatly....yes lemon juice can lighten your hair....but only a little....if you want to lighten your hair...i suggest a product called 'Sun In' it's the best all you do is spray it in your hair then you have to stay in the sun...and then your hair just lightens up..........i have no idea about the acne though.....Good Luck|`|cb78fa08ad18ad003be3857b05d920d3aa	Just like everyone else said, I have NO CLUE about the acne part, but I do recommend that you use Sun In.

6111420363f9188f25ac7c77854da2a6aa	If your hair is one length or has longer layers it may not scrunch well.  You need to have lots of layering if you want that scrunchy look.  Also if your hair is straight & not curly, it'll look messy.  <br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  Towel dry your hair as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Scrunch in your product (mousse is better that gel if you have fine or thin hair b/c gel is much heavier and will weigh your style down, so will wax.)<br>  <br>  Let your hair air dry and continue to scrunch it as it dries.  Always use your hands, never a brush or comb.  If you need to blow dry make sure you are blowing the air upwards and not down.  This will ensure volume and won't pull your curl out.<br>  <br>  Finally after your hair is dry mist it w/ a pump style hairspray.  Aerosol products aren't wet enough for scrunchy styles.  You may need to use a wide-toothed pick and gently tease or back-comb curls into place.  Then mist again w/ spray to hold.<br>  <br>  Good Luck~<br>   <br>  ps~If this still hasn't helped talk to your stylist.

I'd just return it, rather than chance it.|`|qQqC2cHIaa	If the swimsuit is a cotton spandex, it can be dyed.  It will not be a deep black, it will be a light black and with time it will fade to grey.  If the swimsuit is nylon spandex, then it's a bit more problematic.  Nylon can be dyed, some say it's easier than cotton, but it's not a project I'd recommend for a beginner as the results can be inconsistent: you could end up with marbling or a tie dye effect. The spandex is the fiber that won't take the dye, the nylon itself will.   Whatever the suit is made of; the dyed suit will not stand up to chlorinated swimming pool water, and it will be suitable for beach wear only.<br>  <br>  For a cotton spandex use any household dye, such as RIT ir Dylon cold water and follow the instructions on the package.  Rit has been re-formulated and works well for many different.dye jobs.   Dylon Cold Water is more common in UK and Canada and not quite as good, but still works. If you can find RIT dye, stick with that.<br>  <br>  To dye nylon, use household dye again, but be sure to add a bit of extra salt and an acid such as vinegar to the dye to help it absorb the colour. A half cup vinegar to the bucket should be fine.  <br>  <br>  No matter the fiber, do not use any dyes that require your suit to be boiled on the stove, the spandex will melt with too much heat.  With dyes that need to be dissolved in boiling water, allow the water to cool before adding the suit.<br>  <br>  For both methods, rinse out the unabsorbed dye, squeeze out the excess water and dry flat.  Do not twist or wring out the suit, you could stretch it out of shape. Do not put your swim suit in the dryer, the spandex fibers will melt!<br>  <br>  I don't know how dark a black you will get by dyeing.  You might be better with a lighter dark colour, like a deep blue or purple; or a light colour like pink, yellow, *whatever*  You should be able to successfully dye the suit, although the results can't be 100% guaranteed.|`|sM7VMLujaa	I don't know why you couldn't dye it.
TiGk3pgDaa	haha, same here. i live in south GA :/<br>  when your hairs wet, put hair gel through it. not too much, of course.<br>  then blow dry, straighten, then use hairspray. agian. not to much.<br>  and maybe buy shampoo specifically for straightend hair, like that thermasilk. it sets it up.|`|CgzgTNPAaa	use garnier fructis gel. there is no shampoo that ACTUALLY makes ur hair straight. sry, u can get it chemically permantly straight at a salon but that hurts ur hair,it breaks it off so dont do that trust me =) good luck hope that helps.....|`|349725e59f79fa41fd0c8a84aa2ce76daa	i think u can get it like chemically straightened or something|`|RnysWyEuaa	It's better if u can get a perm.|`|RuRC4Qgfaa	id say try to use herbal Essenes super straight shampoo...or try gel to keep hair straighter even use a little hairspray...and if all else fails you can get it chemically straightend|`|zKXz8ea9aa	try sleek-look shampoo AND conditioner by matrix in the orange bottle. then use garneir fructis de-friz serum [on damp hair] then straighten. lastly, use garneir fructis hold serum to hold it all in [do not apply too much, it will get greasy or weigh your hair down too much.] <br>  if this doesnt work, i would recommend that you go to a salon to get it permanately straightened. that is, only if you HAVE to straighten it. it costs a lot but im pretty sure you can do it if you save up :)|`|0qQ73bEPaa	use shampoos and conditioners that say "shiny straight" or "smooth and straight". Garnier fructis works, but pantene is better.<br>  <br>  if you blow dry your hair, use a ceramic round brush (bigger the better) try goody's. its 13 dollars in canada. this will help straighten ur hair and also minimize damage. also use anti heat product like loreals hot straight. if you really have to, use your iron.<br>  <br>  once it's straight you need to use an anti humicant. the only one ive found in regular markets (not salons) is pantene's anti himidity hair spray. it costs about 7 dollars in canada, holds your hair while not making it feel stiff. Ive used it only couple of times and have not been dissapointed so far. it has great reviews on epinions.com as well.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|GTEh3QcAaa	try anti-humidity hair or pin-straight hairspray by herbal essence...and also sunsilk and herbal essence carry shampoo for frizzy/poofy hair..<br>  <br>  so wash your hair with that shampoo and spray your hair with some hairspray.|`|c25bb4eeb8a23121abdbb64a43909abcaa	chemically is the only thing i can think of.

n9IB16s2aa	yes, take something to keep your most important stuff in. a small purse or hand clutch would work best because you def. dont want to be carrying around anything bulky all night either.<br>  <br>  bring a lip gloss, house key, cell phone, wallet and just a few quarters in case of an emergency.<br>  <br>  have fun and be safe!|`|jX2ixQyXaa	You could bring a small one for those little odds and ends you might need, but chances are you'll end up putting it down and you might loose it.  If you really don't need it I say go without.  But, if you're like me you'll end up regretting not having your cell (in case your ride bales), a pen and pad (someone will give you their number, etc), or maybe you'll collect a souvenir from the evening you don't want to leave behind.  <br>  <br>  A small one might be a good idea, if you really need one at all.  If you don't have a small one readily available, just grab a piece of pretty cloth and fashion into a sack.  Cut some small holes around where the sack would close and use a pretty ribbon to weave through the holes and tie closed.  Trim the edges of the ribbon and the cloth so it looks store bought.|`|c2Xz97NIaa	Jus try a little clutch bag..some good tips is to find one matching your outfit and they can actually enhance what you wear. if its something like a middle school formal..find one to match your dress or your jelwrey some good websites are www.lulus.com/www.forever21.com/and www.cutesygirl.com|`|Talt1MDqaa	well, if you take it,<br>  you're going to have to worry abut<br>  lugging it around all night.<br>  but maybe you could keep<br>  it with a trusted friend or adult<br>  or maybe even hide it.|`|wjGU1wplaa	i never took anything to those dances.

It's better to put a little money in your pocket, and leave the purse home.|`|KbarX8nSaa	I would take a small bag if you have one around.

cveoktXmaa	Sadly, yes, our bodies have a great sense of humor and it's most likely a butt zit. Nice, huh? You can help speed up he zit lifecycle by putting a hot compress on it. Just soak a washcloth in hot water, place it over the offending bootie area and relax, watch tv, file your nails, read, whatever. Once the washcloth cools, you can repeat. If you do this for awhile (every evening for a few days most likely), it will help draw out the infection and get your tooshie bump-free and healed. If you want to go for the big guns, but some acne cream on the offender and you should be sitting pretty in no time at all. Good luck! :)|`|qgDBnGhfaa	it may be an ingrown hair- just a hair growing on the inside of your skin if it stays for more then i week i would see a doctor.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Maybe it's a zit.|`|M1vLjF2kaa	zit|`|jUuYMVqiaa	sounds like a boil, gross i know, but we all get em! should go away on its own. ride it out sister! i know they hurt :\|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Maybe it's a cyst?

Its going to be orange!!!|`|xcF30urOaa	To first answer how is going to be orange ? That's only if you have black or dark brown hair and all you do is just bleech it agian no worries:)<br>  <br>  Although I would never dye my hair blonde ,I know girls that do that's how they do it .
hMY5HDlIaa	Well it has these tiny spikes that cling to your hair. Of course, you need to tease your hair a little and use some hairspray so it could grip onto your hair better. I've used it on myself and my sister. Since I have a lot of layers and thin (density) hair, "bump it" isn't right for me. My sister, on the other hand, has long layers and lots of hair so "bump it" works well on her.<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  I'm sorry if the word "spike" scares you but I really can't think of a better word choice [x Don't worry, it doesn't hurt unless you push it against your head really hard.
Ec2uIBjxaa	All my friends fake tans come out orrange<br>  they got bagged out so badly<br>  everyone called them carrot legs|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Spray tans don't last very long, and they can be pretty expensive. My salon charges like $30.00 for one session, and it only lasts 3-5 days or so. You wouldn't become orange, especially if you get it done at a salon. I'd just wait and keep tanning in the bed. Keep your skin super moisturized (use lotion before and after...and all the time lol). From my experience, using lotion seemed to make my tan deeper and last longer.|`|jHSyRa0taa	Not me.  But I think that could depend on if you are fair skinned.  I have olive skin so the orange gets masked a bit if it happen.  Also, if you have a base tan much more unlikely - make sense? Some salons use cheap solution which gives the orange appearance.  I strongly believe in salons that use both Mystic Tanners with the companies sprays.  Some salons chince and buy cheaper solution.  I would just ask what solution they are using.  If they don't know...hmmm.  If they do know and it isn't Mystic tan solution maybe ask them why they don't use that.  Who knows maybe they found something even better. You could also ask for the brand name and search for reviews online which would most likely be reviewed by tanning salons so you would be getting expert reviews.  You might just need to make a couple phone calls to find the right place.|`|1wzuD8RRaa	Not necessarily. I got a spray tan a few years back for my senior homecoming and it looked awesome.  I'm pretty pale but it turned me a believable shade of brown.  Just make sure you choose an appropriate level for your skin.  I'm strawberry blonde and really pale and I went with level one in a Mystic Tan and it was great.  I suggest giving it a shot!
AA10830987	American Apparel has the best ones I have ever seen but H and M had some cheaper ones|`|trbNJrJbaa	try EBAY. they have allsorts on there|`|2nXo1Anraa	I believe Habitual makes metallic skinny jeans<br>  Go to American Apparel for leggings
N3qnOlehaa	i think that you should do a sexy smokey eye. it will look fabulous with a red dress and black pumps. it's a classic! Maybe you could go for a nude lip so all your attention is on your eyes. Plus, you wouldn't want to clash with the dress. Put on a nude lipstick and clearish gloss on top. For blush, do whatever goes best with your skin tone. And make sure you wear primer under your foundation if you're planning on wearing it, other wise you'll probably sweat it off, lol.|`|1b01ae88c91a1961a8ed2a92351f35a9aa	i would go for gold eyeliner! it will really bring out your eyes!! :] <br>  <br>  urban decay 24/7 eyeliner in baked $16 at sephora|`|6U4sl15uaa	I totally agree with Gracie DON'T go with a dark Lipstick it will clash with you dress|`|35PQUYqraa	make sure all the shades of red match...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/stylewatch/gallery/red_lips/kate_walsh.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/st...</a><br>  <br>  ^^^you are welcomee:)
bhyUX6kkaa	You don't need to go to any cosmetology school if you want to work as a makeup artist privately. Meaning, if you are going to work at private events like weddings or on film sets, or photo shoots.... anything closed to the public you don't need a license, or even makeup counters. If you want to work as makeup artist in a spa or hair salon you need a license. I'm a freelance makeup artist and most are. Everyone I know that went to cosmetology school went because they wanted to go down that path. All my makeup artists friends and myself just took courses. <br>  I do live in California and the laws may vary from state to state, but I know that is the law in lots of states because I called and researched myself.<br>  <br>  If you just want to go in the beauty makeup  freelance direction you should try the event makeup artist. It's wonderful and affordable and so thorough. I used it myself and am so happy. I learnt the same things as my friends who spent thousands on tuition and now we make the same amount of money.<br>  <br>  www.theeventmakeupartist.com|`|a1KT2SQlaa	i think you can become an esthetician and that focuses on skin care, makeup and waxing. so you would always have a gig in between makeup. of course until you launch your own line and are to busy doing covers for vogue. look into it!

4ZazLxgsaa	You should always ask this question of a reputable artist. The cost will also vary depending on where you go. Just remember, you usually get what you pay for, you don't want to bargain shop with tattoos.<br>  <br>  Also, the referenced tattoo pain chart is unreliable. Everyone has a different pain threshold, and there are too many variables to consider.<br>  <br>  Do you research to find a creditable shop and go in and talk to them. They will be able to work with you on your idea and create something to your liking.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	The first answerer is correct. Copying other people's tattoos is extremely bad etiquette. Imagine you put your heart and soul into your own design, and wore it happy in the knowledge that it is exclusive to you, only to find out someone had copied it? It'd be awful, wouldn't it. Have the same words but have your artist design something individual to you. And for what it's worth, that is a terrible version of a diamond. That's just a shape with lines - diamonds have light reflecting off it in all angles, <a href="http://www.modernjeweler.com/images/article/1127841679085_diamond__7_pg95.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.modernjeweler.com/images/arti...</a> - so that's somewhere you can start by changing the original!<br>  <br>  So now that I'm hoping and presuming you will not be using the above design, it gets even less possible to give you a very accurate answer. But I would think you're looking at at around ￡200-￡250 in British money for that sort of thing with that level of simplicity. However this is something you can ask the artist as he designs you your own unique piece.<br>  <br>  As for pain - I have never had my chest done so I cannot comment - all pain is relative though, and all pain is worth it!|`|H3PcFertaa	This is not where you should ask this question.<br>  You need to find a qualified, experienced artist and go to his/her parlor and ask them.<br>  That is the only way that you will get a reliable answer.<br>  And here's a tattoo pain chart:<br>  <a href="http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/DoesItHurt.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/Do...</a>|`|XjMJOt8Kaa	it depends where you go, and depending on how you get it shaded and the size, it can go anywhere from 100-800 or even more depending on the place. but i think it would be around 200 from a alright not too pricey place. <br>  gooodluck! :)|`|h0S31CUXaa	i dont really know how much.. but i think you should get something original and not copy someone elses.<br>  cause thats their own and one day you might bump into eachother.. and BAM .. you know.<br>  <br>  its nice, but make up your own idea|`|nvD6Cej8aa	probly around $400|`|STLYxP39aa	It depends on if its black and grey, the artist, etc.<br>  <br>  I'd say from $500 and up
nJYgQNMbaa	I would read the bottle of Nair first... I don't think that it's meant to be used on pubic hair. Here is an article I found about depilatory creams and pubic hair:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-To-Remove-Pubic-Hair-With-A-Depilatory-Cream&id=593445" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?How-To-Remove-...</a> <br>  <br>  I've heard waxing yourself is difficult and if not done properly you can end up with ingrown hairs, which doesn't sound like too much fun so I would suggest either shaving or get someone who is really good with waxing to do it for you. <br>  <br>  I've also heard of Wahl Clippers which are supposedly great for what you want. Here is a link for them:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.womynsware.com/Home/Novelties/Bath%20and%20Grooming/Wahl%20Clippers" rel="nofollow">http://www.womynsware.com/Home/Novelties...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|bJsbOohSaa	I epilate, it is painful, but last longer than shaving and is cheaper and cleaner than waxing.

Nair is not meant for hair removal there, it's meant for your legs.  If you want to be smooth, you just have to do one or the other.  I'd think to epi would be painful, I'd pass on that.
HDsT2X8yaa	for shoes i would wear the gold flats or black fake/birkenstocks. closed toe tho. and the gloves you could wear a pair of white socks and cut out holes for the fingers. you could also buy a pair of white snow gloves. and prolly at the dollar store for a dollar or walmart or some department store for fairly cheap. |`|VxE46bSFaa	Wear the gold flats.<br>  <br>  Hmm I'm not sure about the gloves.

zqxP5exvaa	Thats really nice of you to do that FOR your girl friend. My Dad got a odey tatoo "for my mom" lol<br>  <br>  I say go for it. Just be prepared to tell the story when people ask "why do u have a dog on ur back?<br>  <br>  <br>  I would get a small one between your shoulder blades. =]|`|lryFNKdEaa	if you ever do get a tattoo for a girl, make sure theres a ring on that finger. or else she might leave you and youll have that tatoo for the rest of your life as a reminder of her. wouldnt though. it will make you appear whipped.<br>  but if its because a dog saved you, then yes go for it thats an amazing tat idea.<br>  <br>  it doesnt say not to get a tat in the bible. who ever says that is handpicking their verses. those opposed say  its because its disrespectful to your body. i have a cross on my heart (right chest) with psalms 23:4 written on it. how could branding yourself with the image of god be bad?<br>  <br>  you were saved by a dog. so yes thats a good idea.|`|4GUpQxWdaa	people get weird tattoos all the time, but if it means something to you, i think you should get it|`|zDJ26bktaa	Do it for you, not for her.|`|Q2qNu2N3aa	personally, i've always thought that getting tattoos for someone else is dumb. especially when it's nothing certain. getting that for her might be a regret if you two were to ever split, you know?<br>  <br>  <br>  however, if it means something to YOU, i think it'd be a fine idea.<br>  tattoos should be something that are meaningful now & for the rest of your life.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I think you should wait until you are 18 before making a decision like this. The fact that you're unsure of whether it would be weird or not to have this tattoo tells me you're not quite ready yet anyway. You need to be at the point where you don't care if people think it's weird or not, you want it so badly, and therefore wouldn't need to ask. And it is the mature and responsible thing to wait until you're an adult - you may wonder how much can change in the space of a year, but a lot can at your age, believe me.<br>  <br>  If you get to the age of 18 and are still set on having the tattoo - then my one other piece of advice would be: would this still be something you'd be happy to have on your body if you and Stacy ever split up? I know you feel like you won't do, ever, but an intelligent person knows that there's no such thing as an invincible relationship, and it is a possibility for you. So I would only go ahead if this means a lot to you as an individual, and that in the event of a break-up in future years, it will still have that meaning to you and not be marred by painful memories of an ex. I know it's not nice to think like that but it's something most mature adults would take into consideration.|`|JduQHocdaa	If it has personal meaning to you,and your 100% sure that you want it then sure. Wait until your 18 though since most professional shops will not tattoo someone under the age of 18.
yvMmTEOCaa	I think its cute! very original and if it matches your personality then I think you should get it|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I think it's lame to copy other peoples' tattoos because you can't come up with your own idea, but I've seen worse ink.<br>  <br>  Wtf.

uekCcy74aa	I have that problem with my bangs, but it's not all that hard to deal with.<br>  <br>  Usually when I sleep, my bangs fall to the sides of my face, and in the morning when I pull them forward, they always have a part in the middle<br>  <br>  Wet your bangs in the sink, making sure to get the roots wet. Using a face cloth, towel off the extra water, and straighten it until it's dry. I'm not sure why this works, but it might be something about the weight of the water or whatever.<br>  <br>  When you buy a straightener, get a skinny one with curved plates, like this one.<a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BXEY1A73L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a><br>  <br>  Do NOT get a big thick one like this <a href="http://www.hairstyles-tools.com/images/futura_flat_iron.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstyles-tools.com/images/f...</a><br>  <br>  The small width will let you use the flat iron better. Make sure to slightly curve your bangs too, don't iron them stick straight, or they'll look really weird. It's easier to do the curve with curved plates, but if you can't find one with curves, it's not that big of a deal, as long as it's skinny.|`|154dzJ1Faa	If you part your hair in the middle, it will be in the middle.  If you part your hair on the side, it will be on the side.  If you don't want a part, there won't be one.<br>  <br>  You have control of how it looks, you know!  Cutting only makes it shorter... what happens after that is all up to you.|`|XbVtfiYkaa	yes, you can use hair spray but it might not be good for your hair to use it all the time. It depends how long you had your hair parted. If your hair naturally parts to the same spot, that means it'll part there if you get bangs. Try asking your hair stylist, they might have some good advice. Maybe you could try getting sidebangs first, but I think bangs look awesome! Good Luck|`|UqzGLPq5aa	definitely avoidable but you'll have to be aware of your bang placement at all times, meaning a lot of fiddling, and also meaning they will get dirty pretty fast.<br>  Try straightening it with just a little (very, very light misting) of hairspray.<br>  Love the bangs, by the way, they will look good!<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|fywbC6SAaa	It certainly is. For one, it's more avoidable if your whole hair is in a side parting. Two, if you straighten your bangs, they'll not part and also if you blow dry them into position using a thin nozzle to aim the air flow and a fine toothed comb.|`|AA10296961	honestly, yes it will happen a few times a day at leasttt if your lucky. bangs are a pain in the as$ trust me, i had them for 12 years. save yourself and do nottt get them.|`|KMVmgbfOaa	Depends on what your hair is trained to do.  If you use hair spray and work with them for awhile, they will stay put.  |`|6GME1fZUaa	I love that actress! And I have bangs like that. Unfortunately they do tend to part down the middle. I just constantly comb my fingers through them. P.S. Those bangs look best on people with an oval face.

0OgmfPmiaa	I love k-pak it's seriously saved my hair. the shampoo & conditioner are really good because they dont have silicone in them. If you use your regular shampoo, it will have silicone in it which can block the protein coming in from the reconstructor.  Also, there isn't so much protein in the shampoo and condition so you can use them on a daily basis. Here's what I do: Shampoo & condition everyday with k-pak. Once a week use the Intense Hydrator and every two weeks I use the Reconstructor along with the intense hydrator. Hope that helps!! feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions!
8IfePMa3aa	Make friends with your local piercers and if they're willing to teach they will. If you're going to ask about an apprenticeship, don't waste their time going in empty handed. Make sure you have basic piercing knowledge and certifications first - CPR/ First Aid and Blood Borne Pathogens. Both classes can be taken through the health department. It tells them that you are serious about it and not just another one of the masses.

(depending of how you hold it)|`|Vqqc54oNaa	Remington wet to straight... its only going to stay straight until you wash it though.|`|KfzuzB47aa	get a special spray that will keep you from getting split ends or damaged hair. get a conditioner to prevent that to i like ausie personally. spray the stuff i was talking about in your hair while its wet and use a hair dryer to dry it after you towel dry it as much as possible. get the tiny flat iron and little chunks of hair at a time and then brush it together and then go over it again with the straightener and then brush it again and look for parts that dont look straight or satisfy you and go over them. and when your done use a little hair spray to hold it you might want some extra strength since you live in a tropical area. it wont stay straight for 3 days like that but it should do pretty good.|`|51pUgWvGaa	anyone will work, but may not stay for 3 days,( plus that is soooooo unhealthy and dirty), You should get a ceramic flat iron so that there is not too much damage, plus you need one that gets hot enough to get out the curls the first time on each stroke.

The name or company is just selling itself to the consumer.<br>  <br>  Technique is whats important. Try using a flat iron that has one side a comb and the other a flat iron. <br>  <br>  A really good iron are the ones that are gold plated.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your hair is damp then add in leave in conditioner, then straighten your hair right away.<br>  <br>  To keep your hair straight for days, you HAVE to wrap your hair to your head, technical terms, Doobi.

( but not heavily applied) or u could go for some pretty eye shadows. (light colors) it all depends on what color eyes u have and what will look good on u. and for the face... i use mineral powder. it gives me a light coverage and really makes me look all natural. ( not like im wearing a mask of orange makeup caked on) haha. so deffently try the natural look and work ur way up. exsperiment at home and see what looks best on u.<br>  good luck girl=)|`|YZBybLrgaa	start off with just mascara and lipgloss and maybe some eyeshadow. that is all easy and when you get a little older, you can put more on like eyeliner. stay away from foundation though.. i don't ever wear it, and my skin looks pretty good because of it.|`|FpUPEJZyaa	omgosh, yesterday i was on youtube and this video really caught my eye about putting makeup on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fafinettex3" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/fafinettex3</a>|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	Practice, lots of practice, and experiment. You'll find it.|`|sPDQIxJTaa	youtube. :)|`|rSIF5jtSaa	I think that you should ask your mom these questions. If you're not because, you're not supposed to be wearing make up (which is what it sounds like) then maybe, you shouldn't be. If you can come up with your own means of getting it, you need to go to the store and find out what color of foundation that you wear. They have color pallets that you can look at to find out your color. They also, now sell sets of eyeshadows so, if you have a certain eye color, you can buy a pallete of the colors you can wear. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9tNLDTsHaa	Well knowing your skin tone would help, but here's a simple guide:<br>  <br>  Mascara and eyeliner is better for a special event, unless you're older (late teens and over), then you can get away with it during the day. If you're under that age, and you wanna know a day look, just use mascara, and only one coat. Any more and it'll look too bold.<br>  <br>  For lips, if your skin is pale, go with light pink or nudes. If your skin is medium to tan, use a darker pink, like a darker mauve, or even light brown. If your skin is dark, then darker reds (not TOO deep though) or really dark pinks and browns can work for you. They key is to experiment....only you can see what'll work for you. If all else fails, there's always the trusty lip balm to the rescue! XD<br>  <br>  For eyes, again, it depends on your skin tone. If you want a simple look, then:<br>  <br>  For light or pale skin: lighter versions of any color will work...baby blue, baby pink white with shimmer, things like that.<br>  <br>  For medium: light brown, or maybe like a sage green, those are good neutrals.<br>  <br>  For Deep: Darker purple, tan, or a burgundy will suit you.<br>  <br>  If you need anymore help lemme know! I'd be glad to help! ^_^|`|ucfR5uHwaa	go to the store and buy a loose powder in the color closest to your skin<br>  <br>  when you put it on, just shake some powder onto the pad or dip the brush into it and just rub it all over your cheeks, forehead, nose, chin, and below and above your eyes <br>  <br>  try not to start wearing liquid make up! it's such a pain in the butt and it stains everything and it looks really cakey and weird<br>  <br>  so just try to stick with some powder :)|`|70de3064234ae9f812b885c3198f7187aa	i had this same problem when i first was starting to wear makeup. (i'm a freshman in high school) <br>  i went to my hairstylest and she taught me how to apply makeup on correctly and it was also free of charge. ;] <br>  i now use Bare Minerals, it's a little spendy but it's really good quality makeup. if you don't want to spend lots, true blend is also very good too. <br>  also don't put on too much eyeliner. just rim your eye HALF way, maybe try using a brown instead of a black and if you put eyeliner on the top only put it on half also. <br>  less is more!! :) <br>  hope this helped!|`|lNS13xoraa	You have to go with your skin tone, that is why i don't like using other peoples makeup. if you have blue eyes you use brown eyeliner you always use a different color it brings out your eyes. then do a light color of blush, or none i don't put anything. a mascara is needed out of everything do a dark, lush, volumizing one it will work fantastically. lastly add the finishing touch with a lip gloss that is shiny, a clear or a light pink, if you have really light white ghost skin do a dark red lipstick or lip color gloss. it doesn't matter but red will stand out! i hope i helped.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	It takes some time to learn how to apply it right.|`|uXvvC9RAaa	look on utube, lots of makeup lessons|`|9LUHPAi2aa	ask your mom for help since she has them|`|45wIxLXOaa	it really depends on facial structure, and what you want to highlight about your face <br>  i would search on youtube for the lessons that apply to you most <br>  this lady has lots of different styles: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/panacea81" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/panacea81</a><br>  <br>  it takes practice mostly, and getting used to whats good for you|`|JepoE1Pwaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-P5bXdOBRk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-P5bXdOB...</a>|`|JxTPXYr2aa	WOW

Repeat a few times<br>  4. Wait - do this every day (just be careful not to over dry your hands )<br>  <br>  Next time not only wash hands straight away buy also use a tan removing scrub.

Dont worry too much.  It will be ichy for some time, then it will clogg up and be normal again.  After its clogged up and normal for a long while and u really want to get it pierced, i suggest not to go back to the same store.|`|RPhla0R7aa	You should clean it and maybe put neosporin on it or you could try to go back and look for the person who pierced it.|`|Jwh5enUCaa	Use alcohol!

fjTVAbdBaa	You should not have to pay anyone to become a model. You don't have to go to modeling school. You need to go get some pictures taken. You might be able to find a photographer on craigslist who is looking for models (bring your parents, make sure they are legit photographers... not the 18 and up kind). Or you could pay to get some headshots taken. Then you will have to go to an agent. Once again, and agent gets paid a % of the checks from the job they get you. If they think you could make it as a model they will take you as their client, otherwise they won't. <br>  You are not going to go to school and have them make you a model. I bet you there were lots of girl that were "first on their list" because $$$ is first on their list.|`|fovKsSH6aa	Forget modeling school.<br>  Be natural, be yourself, not some cliche model.<br>  Find a trustworthy photographer, get pictures taken, start creating your portfolio.<br>  You are still very young, school is your priority. Nevertheless, you can find an agent, send your pictures to agencies, etc.<br>  If you really do get work as a model, you can still consider modeling school & other lessons later.|`|kDQ1ZCFFaa	i was accepted into barbizon modeling and went to the school. its really not a scam one of my friends got to be a back up dancer in a movie|`|CgEQAgXhaa	Barbazon is a scam!!!!

qPtE2Dbdaa	The wave just vibrates on your skin and really doesn't clean your skin at all. You are better off using another Neutrogena product. Most are great for acne prone skin.  But the wave, is pretty much a piece of junk and a waste of money.|`|nnuTNmWsaa	I use the wave too its good but i don't think its much better than any other products. I think its only good because it scrubs your face you just have to move the thing around. Try using clean and clear advance system it really works it has wash, moisturizer, and spot treatment it is great|`|JsNG9IIDaa	one word: proactive! it works great i used it and gets rid of acne, i also suggest you try the refining mask for spot treatment from them :) And you might be breaking out (because its after a few months) as a result of either stress, your period coming, change in eating habits or not drinking enough water. hope that helps!

Io credo invece che ci siano qualità mooolto più importanti tipo la simpatia o la bellezza interiore..|`|AiHlyR8raa	Veramente io mi sono innamorate di persone non bellisime, anzi non belle, ma mi avevano catturato.|`|KCC8Bp1Iaa	e' una cosa naturale,pero' magari se ci sono x esempio 2 ragazzi belli te ne potrà piacere in particolare solo uno di quei 2 maggiormente..e' solo questione di gusti e di modi di essere|`|Rkv3bBZVaa	Non è proprio così.<br>  Sollevando problemi di natura psicologica e sociologica non ammettendo componenti irrazionali, l'amore sboccia con le persone che si è conosciute, prima condizione naturalmente,  e di cui si è (stati) attratti.<br>  Quindi il problema diventa: perchè si è attratti dalle persone belle?<br>  L'attrazione, se si vuole tirare in ballo l'antropologia , avviene per un fenomeno semplice: amore delle curve. Le curve possono essere un indice di bellezza. L'uomo guarda il seno e i fianchi e cerca le forme 90-60-90, che rappresentano la perfezione per antonomasia, perchè sono proprio quelle che assicurano nell'immaginario dell'uomo la miglior sicurezza di conservazione della specie. Per le donne idem. Le curve (spalle, culo, gambe, altro) hanno a che fare con la virilità e la sicurezza della prole.<br>  Ma l'amore non è solo calcolo statistico.<br>  A volte ci si innamora e basta. E se vogliamo speculare su qualcosa meglio farlo sul carattere, perchè sull'estetica è difficile studiare delle correlazioni tra la bellezza e l'invaghimento.<br>  Si potrebbe far notare che l'innamoramento è un'attività tra due sole parti e che la bellezza sia frutto di una impressione delle parti, generalmente biunivoca: chi si ama si vede come la coppia più bella del Mondo, spesso anche solo univoca nel senso da te messo in luce.<br>  L'innamorato è sempre innamorato della persona più bella<br>  Quindi ti rispondo che la domanda è un'altra, più interessante: perchè le persone che non sono belle si innamorano?|`|kbClD2Hqaa	non credo proprio sia così...di solito si prova attrazione fisica x le persone più belle,si ma nn ci se ne innamora almeno ke nn siano anche belle dentro..ci si innamora di quella persona ke ti fa divertire scherzare ridere e allor stesso tempo battere il cuore...nn di un ragazzo bello ke nn trasmette niente...|`|wlgqOwPVaa	perche sn  + belle....No??|`|xG4aEqXHaa	xke molti si fanno ingannare dall'apparenza ed è una cosa sbagliatissima...|`|8NDhMGecaa	la bellezza è soggettiva.<br>  attualmente per noi una persona bella è magra e alta.<br>  se consideriamo gli antichi popoli dell'america, ritenevano una persona bella se aveva quelli che noi chiamiamo difetti.<br>  per esempio consideravano una persona strabica molto affascinante e spesso ai bambini piccoli legavano tra gli occhi una pallina in modo tale da poter ottenere "artigianalmente" lo strabismo|`|9LxmS2x4aa	Parli di bellezza fisica o bellezza interiore? Perchè non è vero che ci si innamora solo delle persone belle fuori... anzi! Però se una persona ti dà delle belle sensazioni e emozioni, ci stai bene, e il tempo che ci passi assieme sembra non bastare mai, potrebbe anche non rispettare i classici canoni di bellezza.. eppure a te sembrerà bellissima! E non smetteresti mai di guardarla... <br>  <br>  Allora ti dò ragione: le persone di cui ci innamoriamo sono sempre belle!|`|D2EIXVWKaa	specialmente se si è un po bruttini si cercano persone belle x sentirsi piu "guardati", per vedere la bellezza k non trovi in te nell'altra persona...<br>  il problema è  ke le persone meno belle dei "bellissimi" non piacciono xkè si cerca sempre il meglio...il genere umano è fatto cosi!! non possiamo cambiarci, anke se lo vorremo,a volte,..xkè è piu forte di noi....=D<br>  <br>  inoltre è pericoloso innamorarsi dei bellissimi xkè sono le persno piu amate(ad esempio a scuola, in gruppo di amici,ecc.) e si riskia di prendere una MEGA fregatura...poi ci stai male...=(|`|DtDoXrwNaa	io penso xke prima d tutto c'è l'attrazione fisica!|`|TDTPHMPcaa	la bellezza è sicuramente un bel biglietto da visita,neanch'io mi sognerei di fermare una ragazza brutta, ma l' innamoramento è un' altra cosa , è magia, della persona che sei innamorato ti piace tutto anche i suoi difetti, ed anche se per gli altri non è un granché per te è la più bella.|`|aKyli0N1aa	No non ci si innamora...innamorarsi è pensare sempre a lei, vivere x una persona, volere solo la sua felicità anche accantonando la propria...L'aspetto fisico conta è vero ma solo x il primo impatto perchè, penso sia così anke x i maschi, non avrebbe senso portare avanti qualcosa di serio con una persona ke nn sa andare oltre le apparenze o con la quale non riesci a fare un discorso serio. Dopo un po di tempo la passione sparirebbe. Per questo non bisogna avere fretta ma bisogna aspettare la persona giusta cercando di non giudicarla solo dall'aspetto esteriore...

Also, be sure and talk with your stylist.|`|HRD0Jknsaa	Holiday hairstyles<br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com/2007/12/holiday-hairstyle.html" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com/2007/12/holid...</a><br>  <br>  Holiday hairstyles- Updos & Ponytails<br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com/2007/12/holiday-hairstyles-updos-pony-tails.html" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com/2007/12/holid...</a><br>  <br>  Tips for all different type of Hairstyles<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b7RZOQkWnNJEAw--?cq=1&p=4">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b...</a>|`|2pLhLcm4aa	Hey, Try this site!

020230977088e3660455a8bad8a6d33aaa	well u really should use fresh not store bort but it is good for aging ect.. anyway just put it on and leave it|`|trbNJrJbaa	i dont no if aloe vera  helps with signs of ageing and acne as its a cooling agent for like sunburn ect. does it not say on the bottle/tube how long to leave it on. i have aloe vera and i use it for sunburn ect when i go on holiday and it says to leave it on and let it soak into the skin, so i think you will be fine just putting a little bit on and letting it soak into the skin use it as a moisteriser.

744368c4b8e408245a2cd2b9e2b34434aa	I just want to say one thing....STRAIGHTENERS....is how its spelled..|`|zECK1Shdaa	i have one of those. they take a long time to straighten your hair, and when i did mine, it turned out all frizzy. i have a new one by remington. it is pink and brown and you can get it at target. i blowdry my hair before i straighten it...duh|`|eUiMXcFcaa	yup i have a wet2straight straightener and i really like it. i have noticed that i prefer letting my hair dry to at least damp (as opposed to wet) before using it because it's easier to straighten. also my hairdresser told me that a ceramic straightener is less damaging to your hair - i have both, but i stick with the wet2straight and just deep condition a lot to keep my hair healthy.  the straightener is really easy to use, has really straightforward settings and everything, and it heats up really quickly. also it will turn off after an hour of inactivity so if you accidentally leave it on your house won't burn down :] my only problem with it is that it's meant to be unplugged when you're done using it so if you don't it'll beep every once in a while to remind you to. that was annoying for me because i had my mirror in front of the outlet, but you can just get a power strip and switch it off when you're done. ha wow...sorry i'm writing a whole essay about a straightener...|`|6QVJQn9aaa	ghd straighteners are the best!!! i have one and it cost 120 dollars but well worth the money dont straighten your hair wet even if the straightener is made for that becuz it will damage your hair rele bad just blow dry it or let it air dry|`|bkKHjozQaa	Chi Straightener's are the best. They are about $100-150 but they are amazing! I own one, they are the best of the best, and they last FOREVER literally.|`|PuV0wOEAaa	i dont have that strighner but i have the chi and it is FANTASTIC|`|8i2RdWGMaa	I have the Remington wet 2 straight, I love it.<br>  My hair is naturally wavy/curly and very thick.  <br>  I saw quite a few people up top said it takes a long time to straighten your hair with it, but you're saving time by not having to blow-dry it.<br>  It used to take me 20 minutes at least to blow dry my hair, then another 30-40 to straighten it, now I'm ready in 30 or less.<br>  It actually works better on my hair, if I straighten/dry it when it's pretty wet.  I usually only wait 5 minutes after showering to do it.  I don't know why it works better when it's soaking wet than when it's drier.<br>  It does get very hot though, I turn mine up to 30 and your hair will be hot, be careful about that.  I use my brush to pick the hair back up if it's not straight/dry all the way, instead of grabbing it again.|`|J5QLUqFTaa	I have one and they do work well to go from wet to straight.  The straightener has different levels of heat for dry, damp, and wet.  I have had mine for over and year and use it almost everyday and it's still in pretty good shape. However, it is unhealthy to straighten your hair when it is wet so try and dry your hair first whenever possible!|`|7rrkWUZBaa	I've used a lot of straighteners. <br>  I've tried the "wet 2 straight" straighteners. They don't work well with thick, curly, frizzy hair. If you have fine hair, it would work great for you.<br>  <br>  Personally I like chi or paul mitchell. They are both about the same price and work marvelously!<br>  <br>  If you don't want to shell out that much money Conair infiniti straightener works well with my hair as well. Its like 20 bucks at walmart. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|Nh0DY3bHaa	Okay... I have the wet 2 straight hair straightener and I love it. <br>  I blow dry my hair first and then put it on setting "30". Even though the direction say 30 is for wet hair. I have learned it needs to be as hot as possible. I have naturally curly hair and sure it take a while but it works. <br>  <br>  Make sure you use style aid to protect your hair from the heat or else you'll end up with burnt damaged hair. I've posted a  few links for you. I use the first link when my hair is still wet. I use 2 pumps and rub it in. Stay away from the roots. After I blow dry my hair ( making sure the roots are completely dry ) I begin to section my hair. The smaller the section the easier and faster it works. I start with straightening the bottom layer first and work my way up to the top layer. the second link I posted for you is the spray I use before I attack my dry hair w/ the straightener. It smells really good and works miracles to protect my hair. And lastly I posted the third link for the finishing spray. You want to make sure you seal in the moisture and again protect your hair from UV rays. It makes your hair shinny, healthy looking and smooth too. <br>  <br>  I hope this has helped.<br>  <br>  About $6.00<br>  <a href="http://www.paulmitchell.com/Products/PaulMitchell/Smoothing/Pages/SuperSkinnySerum.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.paulmitchell.com/Products/Pau...</a><br>  <br>  About $13.00<br>  <a href="http://www.matrix.com/products/sleek_look/iron_smoother.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.matrix.com/products/sleek_loo...</a><br>  <br>  About $10.00 third product on page<br>  <a href="http://www.matrix.com/products/biolage/colorcaretherapie.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.matrix.com/products/biolage/c...</a>|`|ALAqODAfaa	i have the wet 2 straight i think by Remington and it works sooo good. I dont know what i would do without it i swear by it lol<br>  <br>  if you have sopping wet hair set it to 30 and it will straighten it and dry it and it works really good without making your hair dried out seeming or frizzy. good luck|`|8b97275f113235793bc21bdf9c56d0ebaa	my cousin who is a hair stylist bought a wet to dry chi straightner and she hated it ... it made hair really frizzy and took forever to do it...so if this particular one didnt work im gonna guess all the other wet 2 drys dont work either.. just do the old fashioned way..blow dry and then straighten.|`|7y2PDEkVaa	i had one..it ruins your hair! dont get it...get a chi. or if your looking for something less expensive, ask your hair dresser about a good, cheaper one.|`|YwZDISGGaa	i heard from friends that the wet 2 sreight works good.|`|4EHifN7Eaa	They don't work for my hair. I guess it depends on what kind of hair you have. if your hair is already pretty straight, it should work fine. If your hair is really curly or kinky, you'll probably need to get a bit more expensive one. I heard Chi is really good but it's a bit expensive. I have Paul Brown Hawaii...it's about 150 bucks..it works AMAZING! Conair works alright too for a cheaper model.|`|IR7YtyTaaa	Do not use a wet hair straightener! They will fry you hair. The best straightener is a Remington with teflon. It doesnt fry your hair to much. I reccomend to protect your hair deep conditioning it 1-2 times a week and using heat resistance spray to keep your hair healthy.|`|0XCM9Ix8aa	yea they kinda work...but it takes a loooong time you should just blow dry it first......and dont buy a really expensive one i have a really cheap one and it works great i think its conair.<br>  o and the wet 2 straights get like really hot too lol so be careul if you use it|`|qURzRyX3aa	I just happened 2 use a straightener 2day w/ a wet head and, well, i recommend the *wet straight Remington* it's cheap, like around $20 and it works perfect 4 me. if u have thick hair, probably 5 min. longer than normal or thin! IT'S PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|qhu4gsopaa	The wet to straight ones dont work that well and make you hair feel kinda of weird. I use ceramagic quick, and it works great... but it is a little expensive (about 100). I think it is totally worth it though because it is fast and works extremely well.|`|EuGEzwlmaa	my cousin has one of those and says it doent work all that well as the comercials or advertisemnet say. and i recommend you buy a I S O international ceramic ionic straightener it works really well it also curls your hair|`|Ju3FhBT0aa	I have a wet 2 straight flat iron and my hair curly......it dsnt work as well as i thought it would it makes my hair all puffy....but i guess it depends on the texture of your hair|`|epySUySCaa	wet to straight does kinda work..i found that if you wash your hair then blowdry it then wait like 20-30 min then straighten it works faster..<br>  a chi also works..|`|lgcMjEcraa	i personally don't like those <br>  but yeah i heard they work ok <br>  but the better the brand the higher the price|`|nerCfKDdaa	it does but u should blow dry ur hair b4 u start straightening it.<br>  Iit dont gotta be all the way dry but not like all really really wet|`|gbbwrS00aa	chi.<br>  thats what i use.|`|3LHd1JR9aa	paul mitchell straightener|`|VLEOgboxaa	no duh its called wet 2 straight|`|CMsh5mlJaa	get the 'chi' <br>  or  'herstyler' <br>  they work really<br>  good.

Z2NLFBOFaa	i don't think it's TOO noticeable. but i was told once that you can blow air through it. XD<br>  <br>  <br>  :)!  x|`|770dfb939469e7f041bd40ca1e249693aa	Sure, you can still see the hole. As the skin loses it's ability to bounce back as it ages, the hole will get bigger, too. Probably about time the adult wishes they'd never gotten their lip pierced when they were a teen!! : /
2587a1a351884ba3f90c69a49bfc5ff1aa	Yes i totally think they would stand out. Try some blonde highlights around your face|`|770dfb939469e7f041bd40ca1e249693aa	Yes, your roots will be noticeable. The easiest thing to do would be to add medium brown streaks from any part you wear in your hair so as your natural color comes in, it won't be so noticeable. Try to have the streaks be as close as possible to your natural medium brown color.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! ; )|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	I have that same problem. I striped my hair so the roots weren't visible anymore.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/10gms5d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i36.tinypic.com/10gms5d.jpg</a><br>  <br>  :)!   x|`|NQOoeoWwaa	Yeah they would be noticeable... mine are and I'm not even a brunette but a dark blonde lol.|`|OGyb5ay9aa	yes...it would look too harsh in  my opinion...go for carmel highlights instead..looks more natural..good luck!

1w3k29iuaa	the stinging means that the microcollagen or collagen in the product is diffusing into your lips to give it that plump. its the sort of "proof" the company wants you to feel that your lips are "getting fuller/bigger." <br>  <br>  its like how a bee stings, and at the site of the bite, your skin gets kinda bigger and swollen yaknow? |`|b91eddc5073c6854422022b5397415e4aa	Most lip plumpers make your lips sting, no matter how much you use. Wipe it off if you want but it won't do much if the stinging is gone. 
eOiEyo3Haa	Try to use shampoo that can help straighten your hair.. i already had straight hair but when i used sunsilk shampoo and conditioner it helps straighten my hair even more,it works really good so you should try too...xoxo|`|NF252V79aa	You can get it chemically straightened or blow dry it straight with a round brush :)|`|TJTB6PJhaa	Blow dry your hair with a diffuser and a paddle brush.|`|Bwlm6v3Jaa	First, wash and shampoo your hair as usual. Then, separate it into three to four sections. Keep the bottom section down and the others clipped up. Use a flat brush and a blow dryer and go over your hair till its straight and dry. Do that to each section and then go over them all at once. Spray them with a hair straightening serum all over your head. You could also buy a relaxer from a saloon or a drug store that will keep your hair straight, longer. It all depends on how curly or wavy your hair is. If it is super curly, it might be better just to do what I have previously stated than use a cheap [like 19 dollars, I've seen] to do touch ups and to go back over it. In the long run, it may be better just to buy a good straighter. Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  :]]|`|4cfad72d9681ff8bba1e815806a91bd7aa	Get a relaxer<br>  you put it in your hair (read the directions on the box) and your hair stays straight for a couple of months. <br>  Even when you wash it.|`|321d5e2da2cd6bd10a0f864e974bbefeaa	Put your hair up in layers, take a little section down at a time (about an inch wide) and use a large roundbrush or a paddle brush. <br>  I wouldn't recommend chemical straightening.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	I use a relaxer.<br>  They have seperate ones for different hair types.

In some tribal societies they create tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and put ink, ashes or other coloring agents into the wounds. In other cultures tattoo are created by beating ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones. In Japan the traditional tattooing method is called Irezumi. In this method they make tattoos by hand poking i.e. they insert the ink under the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and hand held tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. <br>  <br>  Today, the most common method of tattooing is with the electric tattooing machines. Though tattoo machines are very popular yet they are not used everywhere. Tattoo machines make tattooing very easy. Tattooing machines insert ink into the skin by way of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The tattooing needles go and come out of skin hundreds of times per minute. In prisons tattooing is done with homemade machines as common tattoo machines are not available. But the tattoos created by these handmade machines cause pain and injury. There is also major risk of illness, including such blood-borne diseases as HIV and hepatitis. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a good link with a video and written explanation :) <a href="http://video.about.com/tattoo/Getting-a-Tattoo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://video.about.com/tattoo/Getting-a-...</a>|`|Q2qNu2N3aa	they make a stencil like picture of whatever it is you want. and after they clean the area, they press it onto your skin, until you assure them that it's exactly where you want it. after that, there isn't anything left but the needle work :)|`|nvD6Cej8aa	you go to a store they put ink on your back in the shape you pick

Most who get them end up with buyer's remorse. If you truly are best friends you do not need to permanently alter your body to indicate it.|`|3yacqUltaa	You could get something like cookies and milk, pb and j, etc. Or, you could get an art palette, or a boombox.

You trace your design manually onto the carbon to make a stencil, and then use Speed Stick deodorant on the shaved area and stick it on, hold it for a second, then peel it off. You'll have a purple outline to work from. You can also use a thermal processor, which is what it's made for, instead of tracing it manually. The machines are very expensive. If you don't want to use Speed Stick, you can use Stencil Pro transfer solution, or a light coating of Green Soap. Spirit makes the best transfer sheets, about $30 a box of one hundred sheets.|`|HAYlmwdtaa	transfer paper it's called.  it's a 2 part paper one black the other white.  simply put the drawing on the paper and trace over it, be sure not to move the paper or your lines will not be precise
jUuYMVqiaa	the girl before me is right, you might just have "tough" skin. i found my ears difficult to stretch, however i didnt do mine the right way :\ which later was the reason i no longer have stretched ears.<br>  another note: a month is just like a rule of thumb, just because you wait a month doesnt mean they are ready to be stretched in a month. another thing, when you get to larger guages, like going from a 10 to an 8 you should wait about two months and for an 8 to a 6 about 2 1/2 months and so on.<br>  <br>  if the taper is painful to get through then its not ready. there will be some burning but it shouldnt hurt or bleed (this means theyre torn). also if your tapering and its its hard to get through then suddenly becomes easy, this means youve torn your ear and need to go back the the size you were before you tapered.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	You're probably not doing anything wrong, your body just doesn't have the same elasticity as others.  Also, it's not gauging, it's stretching.  You should be slowly sliding the taper in at once and if there's too much resistance, then you should put your current plugs back in and just keep playing with them and tugging on them, then try again in a couple weeks.<br>  <br>  My left ear seemed to give me more troubles than my right.  I didn't experience any difficulty until I went from 8 to 6.  Your skin just isn't that stretchy, no biggie.

gVih4CGwaa	Since she's 11, just use some lip gloss and mascara, no eyeshadow or anything. Or else it makes them look like a spoiled tramp|`|42cQpxviaa	foundation on an 11 year old is definitely not a good idea, because being so young, she probably still has a clear complexion and any face makeup would clog her pores and give her acne earlier. so that's a no-no! lip gloss is fine, it's never too early to start being girly and pretty. but the farthest i would go at 11 would be lip gloss and bottom-eyeliner. later on in her teenage years, when she really needs it she should go for more. she should wash her face every day with soap or face wash, even if she doesn't have pimples! trust me, it'll pay off.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	she's a little young! but if she really wants to i'd say some lip gloss and light eye shadow. foundation might ruin her skin at a young age and make her break out with pimples!|`|FrG9a5o3aa	She's still young, too much makeup could ruin her skin. She has to be careful and not use too much foundation. It would be best to not uses any foundation. Moisturizer is great though. It airs the skin and makes it look natural and smooth. Toner can be used to even out skin tones though.<br>  <br>  Lip gloss is fun, and she can definitely get away with pink or just glossy colors.

Dont get me wrong, I think they are sexy as hill but theres no way i'm bringing one of these girls home to mom. Maybe at one point in their lives they were good girls but now they are definately "dirty" girls. Im not sure which came first, the tattoo or the dirty girl. its like asking which came first between the chicken and the egg. But I really think that one tattoo leads to more and somewhere along they lines, these girls have becomes dirty girls in every way. Its everything from their sexuality to their alcohol/drug use to their, at a minimum, somewhat abusive relationships. Im not saying its true for ALL girls but its true for at least the several I've know. I prefer my women without ink of any kind but I also prefer good girls nowadays. <br>  <br>  But you did ask a question so I like colored flowers or something of that nature on the arms/wrists, or an averaged sized, tribal looking "tramp stamp." Just dont over do it with something like a full sized painting of a ship or something weird on your back. Keep it tasteful and let the tattoo compliment your body. Dont get so much ink that its the other way around.|`|AA10228824	yeh man I love them<br>    I like it on lower back on the start of HIP a small colourful tattoo like a butterfly looks veryi sexy.<br>     Also can have identical tattoos on each boob which would be quiet sexy.

hRHUE5Sbaa	I had them done about 7 years ago. They don't really hurt, it's just the after-care that is more painful than anything. Mine stayed infected even tho i only had them for a week, but my piercer also didn't put jewellery that was long enough in to compensate for the swelling.<br>  If you are that scared about getting them done, then why do it?<br>  I got mine done because i walked into the shop and just decided that i wanted to get them done.<br>  But anyway, all in all, it isn't that painful.
4381ce1eabe1bba2f5000ef04b6611caaa	Yes really badly especially in the tops lol. I would order a size up for both tops and bottoms.
DIrcAT7iaa	1. it depends on your tolerance for pain. but it's really not that bad. it's just a sharp pinch and then it's just sore for a few days. <br>  2. it's SUPER easy to clean. when i got mine done i just sprayed the area with H2OCEAN and then put some more H2OCEAN on a qtip to clean the inside. <br>  <br>  good luck! <br>  it'll be cute and totally worth the pain :]|`|SnDTQwGnaa	I had one done about 13 years ago, it took a year to heal, and after constant cleanings and a lot persistence it is just part of me now.

QMYNU9uNaa	I really like the ring. I think it is more noticeable than earrings and is a really nice piece to have.

But wow, you must be loaded.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	The ring.  They won't look matchy at all because they won't be right next to each other.

I would get the ring it's really pretty,|`|cKjjVcaAaa	they are both ugly|`|MuWth0wyaa	The earrings will go great with your necklace.   It can be too much to have earrings that are long chandlier style with a necklace, but smaller, stud styles will be fine.  The ring is cute too.   What would you wear more often?|`|cFJTZaV8aa	According to me you should buy the ring. As a ring symbolizes eternity which means something that you can cherish forever.|`|3btLY1QCaa	personally, i think that the earrings would be cuteeee:) i dont think it would seem like your playing dress up at alll!!!!! :)|`|gVih4CGwaa	I say either the necklace or the ring.

rtxsfQHkaa	Yes the most important steps for a beautiful make-up is definitely moisturizing your face before putiing on any make-up.<br>  <br>  Firstly you would have to know what type of skin you have. Whether it is oily, dry or combination. Then slowly from there you can work your way out. Like I would recommend oil free and alcohol free for your cleanser, toner and moisturizer. This would not cause you to have any breakout or clogged pores on for your face. Remember when washing or applying any products on your face you must always treat it gently.<br>  <br>  Then is putting concealer to cover up your flaws. The tone you choose for the concealer must be a tone lighter than your liquid foundation otherwise it would appear patchy on your skin after you complete your make-up.<br>  <br>  Next up would be your foundation, you would have to apply your foundation right after you moisturize your face. There are many types of foundation which are powder or liquid form. Personally I find liquid foundation easier to use and apply on my face. You can either use a foundation brush or a sponge. And if you want a more natural look for your foundation you can wet the sponge before applying it on your face. And when choosing the tone of the foundation remember to always put a bit on your face to test it out in order to have the tone closest to your skin tone.<br>  <br>  Then it would be pressed powder or loose powder. Pressed powder is usually for a long way for the day whereby you don't really need to touch up because usually the pigmentation for pressed powder is more intense therefore you don't need to touch-up so reguarly otherwise it would look rather cakey. Loose powder is quite light on the face but then it requires maybe 1 or 2 touch-up during the day because it is very light and need the help of pressed powder to support iit. But you can try mineral foundation in this case because the pigmentation is very dark as well and it goes easy on your face although the it may be quite pricey. <br>  <br>  Next up is putting mascara. Mascara is very important because it "opens" up your eyes making you look very bright. Remember to curl your lashes before putting your mascara otherwise it would not have effect on it and I usually do not curl after applying it because it would actually damage my lashes as the mascara have already dried up. <br>  <br>  And as for eyeliner, it really depends on you because it is up to you to decide whether you want the dramatic effect on your eyes. But of course you can choose other colous instead of black to soften the look. colours like plum, golden, khaki or brown would actually help you look like a fresh girl unless you are attenting a party or something then you can consider black one.<br>  <br>  As for blusher, there are many variety of colours for you to choose from but of course pink is the popular ones. Always smile when applying blusher then you would know where the apple of the cheeks are. And when applying it the strokes of your brush must always go backwards where your ears are. Because if you brush it upwards it wouldn't look so nice but of course this is what I personally feel, you can try it out if you want to see the difference.<br>  <br>  Last but not least your lips. You can choose lipstick which is the matte ones or glossy ones. Or you can choose lip gloss. If you really want to attain the colour of the lipstick, you can use lip concealer to fully erase the your lip- colour and when you apply your lip gloss and lip stick it would look alot more nicer. And also you can try nude colours for your lips, it actually gives you the natural and yet a tinge of sexy look for your face.<br>  <br>  Well that is all the advice I can give for you I really hope it can help up at least abit. ALL THE BEST =) Remember Make-up is full of variety and wonders don't be afraid to try it out..|`|KIaZ0Z2laa	make up is great but dont apply too much because yeh that damages your skin. drink heaps of water, (seirously i do and i never get pimples, but it kidna sucks cos when you forget 2 drink as much they just come back! -_-") you should apply cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen everyday. at night use night creams. try to avoid foundation because that clogs up your pores. umm with applying make up, it's sort of hard to explain. try talking to a beauty therapist? or i dunno google it?|`|6df584d3973d8c6f6fa4f3b2697ef976aa	Hi there hun well first of all I'm a certified make-up artist.....Here are the basic steps for the application of makeup<br>  <br>  1.wash face apply moisturizer then apply concealer underneath eyes to even out dark pigmentation(under eye circles) a good concealer disappears as you blend but still gives you coverage.<br>  <br>  2.Get yourself a powder foundation(test on the inside of your arm if it disappears it's a good choice)I love palladio rice powder/foundation at Sally Beauty Supply or MAC but thats a little to harsh for the skin in my opinion as I have sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  3.apply a powder blush to your cheek bones all the way you your hairline do not stop before because that will give you the race stripe look(a good rule is to smile while applying blush so you can get all the the cheekbone definition)<br>  <br>  4.next apply your eyeshadow base (which generally is a beige/shimmery color) to your entire eyelid.<br>  <br>  5.Next choose a darker color to apply to the crease all the way to the browbone or you can do it from the middle of the eye all the way to the lashline and to the top of the browbone always make sure that you blend everything really well and do not leave any lines or uneven areas.<br>  <br>  6.apply mascara from lashline and out then eyeliner from the inside of eye lashline to the outercorner.<br>  <br>  7.finish off with a pinkish or your choice of lipgloss color and wala!! you're finished.<br>  <br>  This is a low key look and should take you about 10 minutes tops once you get the hang of it.It's your first time so you're bound to make a few errors but be patient and always Remember that make-up is supposed to be fun so don't be afraid to expiriment with different colors and looks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and if you have any other questions feel free to contact me on my email cramirez1002@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)|`|dq2FWlebaa	After washing face, let it dry for a moment. Put toner on a cotton pad and distribute to face. a fool-proof great base for your makeup is mixing half a squirt of your foundation and moisturizer. Rub it together then apply evenly to face. Next, apply concealer to blemishes, under eye circles, etc. Take a blush brush and apply a rosy pink blush on the apples of your cheeks and up in a banana shaped motion. To open up your eyes, dab a shimmery white in the corner of your eyes, then two black coats of mascara on the top and one on the bottom. Finish with a salman pink gloss. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped! <br>  xoxo|`|4S8IKFn0aa	All I know is how to put on eye liner, mascara, and nail polish.|`|Jwh5enUCaa	I tdepends on the person buthey do say moisturizer first, a base is what helps it stay on longer( I do not use it) Mascara goes on your eye lashes I use Lash exact by covergirl it is the best I have found. I also use an eyelash curler you can find them at Wal-mart or any department store. They really help make look your eye lashes look longer. They are cheap. Then there is foundation. Concealer goes on after if you have blotches or bags. There also is translucent powder that helps set it all when oyu are done. Eye shadow on the eyes and eye liner for the top or bottom of your eyes. Do not do botht he top and the bottom just do one or the other. Blush goes on your cheeks. The apples of your cheeks it is hte part where if you make a fish face sticks out.LOL.|`|OyRX3OxLaa	paint your face with lipstick. done deal.|`|nM8yB6Liaa	1 put a cream on ur face then makeup then lipstick ....itz done......<br>  n from my side just look wat u really look|`|dKUSJ23Qaa	oh wash face with cleanser, the St. Ives aprocot one is nice. <br>  1. lotion<br>  2. foundation, coverup or any of the face cleam stuff thats a tan looking color. use it only if ur face isnt clear cuz i seen most asian with really clear faces, if urs is good, dont bother, it will only give u extra wrinkles<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-phr7ao_y_g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-phr7ao_y...</a><br>  <br>  3. use a powder if u used the 2nd step<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igi-L7Ej8CE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igi-L7Ej8...</a><br>  <br>  4.apply eye liner at the bottom and top<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVdetSfBH74&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVdetSfBH...</a><br>  <br>  5. do ur eye shadow( also put white eye shadow right under your eye browns to bring out the eyes)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09KiqMdCSKc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09KiqMdCS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLs6oA4oq8o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLs6oA4oq...</a><br>  <br>  6. put some blush on ur cheek bones<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brbvRCzUPmE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brbvRCzUP...</a><br>  <br>  7.

Then use a moisturizer with and SPF of at least 15. If your skin is oily or you get breakouts, try an oil-free moisturizer. It's good to use an eye cream as well, even as a teenager. Let your moisturizer soak in.<br>  <br>  Then, use a tinted moisturizer or foundation, depending on the condition of your skin. If you have good skin, a tinted moisturizer is fine. Then use a concealer of any skin imperfections you have, like dark circles, blemishes, or broken capillaries. Use a blush on the apples of your cheecks, next. Then, use a transclucent, loose powder to set the makeup. <br>  <br>  For eyes, you can do a lot of different things. But for a natural look, use a lid primer, and then a light, warm toned shadow all over your lid that is close to your skin tone. You can use a little liner, but on your bottom lashline only go 1/3 of the way in. This prevents the liner from making your eyes look small. If you want, you can use a liquid liner on the top and a pencil liner on the bottom. Then use mascara. Fill in your brows with either brow powder or a brow pencil. Filling in your brows really changes the way you look.<br>  <br>  For lips, a simple gloss should be fine.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to remove your makeup before you go to bed. Never sleep with your makeup on all night; it will clog your pores.<br>  <br>  Tip: If you get breakout, try using tea tree oil on your face, but one that has been diluted. It works really well, plus it's natural.<br>  <a href="http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/bodyshop/browse/product_detail.jsp?categoryId=cat3840005&productId=prod170278" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/bodyshop/...</a>
r25ldABpaa	Everyone who is saying you have to or if you don't you won't get any action is putting too much pressure on you. You don't HAVE to do anything and that won't mean that a guy won't still find you attractive. <br>  <br>  I only tried shaving down there once in my life and all I did was irritate it and it wasn't pleasant when it grew back in. Since then I only trim it to keep it maintained and clean. I have a loving boyfriend who is highly attracted to me the way it is. <br>  <br>  If a guy is going to say no to you because you're not bald down there is a guy who is only after that one thing and one that's not worth your time anyway.|`|1r05fktRaa	yes|`|AX13vUJeaa	I just trim it lol.|`|o4qL1wiKaa	yeah definitly.|`|r22vkc9Jaa	if you want to be clean than yes.|`|hdcrxbSTaa	vagina? uh yes i do.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yep|`|a53fff386fa19aac2e074166bccabfebaa	well you dont have to, I DO. only because if i dont it feels all dirty, then when u get ur womanly flow, its just a mess if u dont lol. and its not hard to shave it,...but u can also just get it trimmed, that is if u like it to be there at all, i only know 2 people who dont shave, and they dont have very many sex stories lol just sayin!!!!|`|OzSMiA7caa	I am assuming you're a 'hairy mclairy' down there. hahaha<br>  <br>  Yes, you can shave it lots of people do, or wax it, or use a safe hair removal cream|`|fibUKY4Eaa	i have like a subquestion to this question: how would u like shave "under there without cutting urslef? it is a very sensitive area and ik that i need to shav.....srreh to be gross...|`|KxS7cKRDaa	You don't HAVE to.<br>  <br>  But you probably won't get any action if you don't.<br>  Ever.<br>  <br>  <br>  And do you know ow many guys you attracted to this question?|`|27hANXS4aa	You should be more specific.

h0su8iqdaa	I'm not sure about everything else, but I cleanse, tone, and moisturize because its been working so far. the cleansing cleans out the pores, the toner shrinks them to limit the amount of dirt that goes in and causes acne, and the moisturizer is so that we don't wrinkle and peel as we get older. Plus, some harsh cleansers cause drying and itching of the skin, moisturizer helps to relieve that problem :)|`|l8yfpyy1aa	It mostly depends on your skin type.  Some people cleanse just by running a hot washcloth over their face, with maybe a bit of soap for the T-area (center of forehead, nose, and chin).  Some people need to use a moisturizing cleanser.  Others use an astringent toner based on a solution of witch hazel, to temporarily close their pores.  Acne seems to be mostly a hormone-caused condition, but it never hurts to keep your facial skin as clean and germ-free as possible.<br>  <br>  In dry weather, it seems to be important to use a light lotion to moisturize.  Many of them contain perfume or other ingredients that can make facial skin itch or break out, so I imagine that simple organic products would be safest.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation and facial masks are pretty drastic.  I think they're best suited for oily skin with large pores.|`|CmVNgEmeaa	the answer is pretty easy. <br>  its so your face doesnt look  and feel like a shrivled  up used then tossed out dirty  walmart plastic bag when your only 25 years old.
VN2wyTnFaa	I use Dior Show Blackout and your mascara runs when you cry but not when it rains because there's more water getting onto your lashes when you cry, it's a constant stream of water running through your lashes while when it rains you're trying to duck out of the water and avoiding it. Hope that helped!|`|USQQWsumaa	when you cry the tear ducts are directly behind the lashes so the water pools there for a moment before rolling down your cheek. when it rains the water rarely touches your eye lashes and there isn't enough water there for it to soak the mascara|`|zA98589Baa	Because rain water doesn't come into contact with your lashes a lot and raindrops are very small. When you cry, tears are secreted from your tear ducts which are located on the inner corner of your eyes so the tears will soak up your lashes , causing mascara to run. To avoid this make sure you are using a waterproof mascara. If the mascara you're using isn't waterproof and you don't wish to throw it away and buy another one, don't worry. Get the Clarins Fix' Mascara which is a transparent waterproof seal for your lashes. Use it over regular mascara to make it waterproof. <br>  <br>  Anyway I'm just a teen, so I can't afford high-end mascaras. :( So right now I'm using Revlon's Lash Fantasy mascara. Pretty good for a drugstore brand, I say.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	If it's waterproof then it shouldn't run at all . . . unless it's a cheap drugstore brand.<br>  <br>  Or maybe it's because when you cry the liquid is much more concentrated around the eye area, but when it rains it's not directly in your eyes.<br>  <br>  <3|`|ylI0GQyiaa	i guessing cause when you cry its where the mascara is and the rain doesn't always get on your eyes and i use dior =]|`|AA11839888	mine runs in the rain|`|6dEVfNRIaa	i use sephora waterproof pumper mascara ( something like that) buy waterproof ones. Most waterproof mascaras that i use do not run even i cry =))|`|UuLZBX9daa	I noticed that too!! I use Benefit's BADgal Lash Mascara and I looove it!|`|dKUSJ23Qaa	cuz your tears are hot and the mascara absorbs right in and runs!
08yY1mWCaa	When you change your skin care routine or use different products a lot, it changes the balance of oil in your skin, and that causes it to clog pores, only causing more zits. I would pick one of the rountines (morning or night) and stick with that.
03rHecsHaa	I think it looks great how it is.. very artistically arranged. ;)<br>  <br>  By the way.. I love your room, and the colour of walls and blinds/curtains! :D<br>  I didn't notice any mess on your bed! But I did laugh when I read that, sounds like me, only I'm 10 times worse!

v84od8vraa	Mary Kay has very nice products for sensitive skin, they should be somewhat helpful to your skin which isnt bad really. As far as a hairstyle, i think even dying it brunette and cutting it in layers with some bangs would look awesome, and that way you can also wear it down more often. As far as your age, looks like youre somewhere between 16-20 possibly. Hope im not way off, you just look mature and your second pic has a serious pose which makes you look grown. Well goodluck on your makeover! And dont be self conscious, you have nothing to worry about, but just throwing it out there as alot of teens now a days worry so much about their image, not for themselves but for others and out of self consiousness. Hope i helped a bit!|`|ZNuMrSPYaa	Why dont you get a hair straightener?

You could try flat ironing your hair. Tease it up a bit. It does really look like you do anything to your hair. Use a round brush and hairspray to build some volume and tease it up.

6YwLlYovaa	I know that glycerin can be bought from rite-aid, so try there. <br>  if you can't get to a rite-aid try looking around your local drugstores to see if they stock it. <br>  or you could try ordering some online.<br>  to make a water based mixing medium I mix 1 part glycerin with 3 parts water.<br>  <br>  edit: make sure you make your mixing medium in small batches, as you are not putting in any additives, so your mixing medium won't keep as long as a store bought one would. I'd say mix it in either drops (1 drop glycerin to 3 drops water) or teaspoons (1 teaspoon glycerin to 3 teaspoons water.)<br>  hope this helps!|`|VN2wyTnFaa	You can get glycerin at drugstores I believe and when you make the mixing medium it's 3 parts water to 1 part glycerin (so if you're using teaspoons it would be 3 teaspoons of water and 1 teaspoon of glycerin). And remember to shake it up really well. Good luck!

6YwLlYovaa	drinking lots of water can help improve under-eye circles dramatically. try drinking 8 glasses a day. it's an easy, natural way to help.<br>  if your circles are from lack of sleep (as opposed to circles that are genetic) getting a few more hours of sleep a night can also make a difference.<br>  there is no magic cure for under-eye circles (unfortunately) but keeping the skin under your eyes moisturised can really help as well.<br>  I've also heard that taking fish oil (omega 3) can help, but I haven't tried this so I can't say for sure.<br>  hope I helped!|`|7eWHunfOaa	Use Oriflame's Seeing is Believing eye cream.|`|cSNBibQeaa	its actually a home remedy...u knw abt jhonson's baby lotion na....boil some water to lil warmth & make a paste with this lotion....it shud nt b complete liquid it shud me like a gum...apply gently below your eyes daily in the nite...u can see the effects in a week or so...<br>  my sis use to do it!!!<br>  so i m a witness|`|ArTVrsp7aa	put dry terimic(haldi) with one drop of  milk daily in night soon it will clear....|`|Jwh5enUCaa	I have them too.

def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	yea i guess that vodka would be an ok substitute. try to find a very high proof, or use everclear or just grain alcohol.<br>  <br>  rubbing alcohol may say "isopropyl alcohol" on it. <br>  i looked up methylated spirits and read that it is a denatured alcohol altered so it is not fit for drinking. the fact that it is denatured makes me unsure if it will help sanitized your false eyelashes.<br>  <br>  hydrogen peroxide is NOT the same thing or a substitute for alcohol for these purposes.|`|xM3iQwhaaa	hydrogen peroxide<br>  <br>  should work good. <br>  <br>  hope you have it there|`|BxMInUUNaa	I live in Australia too, here it's called surgical spirits.

pPJz4lYraa	tanning is bad for our skin period|`|e0be991ba3ad4dbcc92013374748439eaa	nope You can not use oil in indoor tanning beds, the oils eats through the acrylic of the bed and can actually cause it to melt onto your skin. Plus oils are NOT sanitary...it is very hard to clean oil off the bed. You have to clean it at least 3 times for it not to feel greasy. I would recommend getting a lotion. Good Luck.|`|CmVNgEmeaa	the people that  work at the tanning solon hate it when people use oil .....any kind of oil. its hard to clean off and it messes up the tanning beds. look for accelerator creams if you wanna get tan faster and keep it longer. basicly  they want you  to keep your skin moisturized, so you can use any kind of lotion. i use the bath and body lotions because they smell awsome it actually makes the whole solon smell great cuz of the heat.|`|8HRsrkcNaa	okay- haha; ive used everything known to man to help me get a better tan, and& nothing really works! but thats just me, if yue want to use oil, use oil- but dont let them know yuer using it! :D thats what i would do, and& make sure yue clean most of the oil off the bed after yue use it!<br>  <br>  good luck honey, and& happy tanning! :D|`|pC2JTJgpaa	You need to use tanning lotion made for tanning beds other oils will damage the acrylic on the bed there are many good lotions that will make ;you tan faster and give you a pretty tan and yes you should use it because it has ingredients in the lotion to protect your skin.|`|Nm0FqiLjaa	nooo dont use tanning oils, it will mess up the acrylic|`|eoL9PxPiaa	The bulbs in a tanning bed put off way more UV rays then the sun does and we generally tan in a short time so using a oil will more than likely make you burn. I would suggest buying a tanning lotion with a bronzer in it, such as Dangerously Dark it gives you immediate results and helps you to get dark quicker. Once you have achieved your base tan you can move up to more of an accelerator Australian Gold has some good ones, stay away from the tingle lotions inless you like that burning feeling. Also, a tip...purchase your lotions on ebay or another internet site you will pay half the price you would normally pay at the salon. Also, make sure you are also using a good moisturizer if your not it can cause you to burn or have an uneven tan...Angel Moisturizer or Kisses is really good and they both smell wonderful! Good luck and happy tanning!|`|8F1PrcOkaa	They tell you not to use tanning oil for two reasons.<br>  <br>  1. If you're in the tanning bed for over 8 minutes, the temperature of the chemicals in the oil rises and cracks the acryllic.<br>  <br>  2. All tanning places sell their own lotions, bronzers, etc. If you bring your own oil.. then you are less likely to buy their products. <br>  <br>  *I've used tanning oil a few times for 8 minute sessions and nothing bad happend. It's kind of a 50/50 chance. If you use it... don't use too much..obviously the less hot oil on the bed.. the better. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)

Go here:|`|TwnFt20Zaa	red or maroon and black or dark  shade of blue..<br>  white is also good.|`|NnG8PxMzaa	I'm pretty sure the main color scheme of Phantom Of the Opera is primarily black with some red and white so black dress with accents or accessories that are red and white would be appropriate.|`|NPEGXGCJaa	ooh yes red is a beautiful color and would go great with the theme phantom of the opera
8THz1sp9aa	The best thing to do is go to your artist and have them help you think of ideas. They are extremely creative and come up with wonderful ideas! good luck.|`|5YMkieeXaa	i think any thing that motivates you, some thing that you always wanted a saying or quote that will push you through.<br>  <br>  or you can have a heart with a harpoon though it im not sure ive never heard of these requests but im pretty sure it will come out well.|`|T7OASw9yaa	dont let anyone choose what tattoo you get. believe me i have 2 sleeves and have had people choose my tats and i didnt like them and had to pay more to cover it up. be origanal|`|80I1aHSGaa	Maybe an image of a man with a raised arm carrying a harpoon and then trying to emerge from another body will be a good idea.

jUuYMVqiaa	ready to use wax kits works just the same as salon waxing really.<br>  as for sweat stains, (i get those too! gross) try using any antiperspirant or antiperspirant/deodorant, not just deodorant (read the labels)<br>  dove clinical strength might work well. i also like arrid extra extra dry.|`|xM3iQwhaaa	for sweat stains, use a medicated deodarant. <br>  if problem persist talk to a doctor (my cousin had this stuff the doctor gave her and now she doesnt get sweat stains unless she does like strenious work like playing tennis or running. <br>  <br>  for the hairs a wax should work , but umm, try shaving the opposite way you do now, and tan them (in the sun not a salon)<br>  i know it sounds wierd but it will help with the shadow becasue it will be more of your skin color.|`|vYj7Nh5Saa	shave and try to scrub with coffee or salt with oil and use whitening deodorant. very effective,,goodluck!|`|3bf853eb6eadae5d5e3c2aa99854d383aa	the hairs that u say are "parallel" to your skin are in-grown hairs. to avoid getting them, shave in the oppsite direction of the hair growth. i shave my armpits and i always have to shave up, down, and side to side to get a close shave. As for the sweat stains, u need to make sure that you are using an antiperspirant not a deodorant. Im guessing that you use a deodorant since it doesnt smell. Antiperspirants keep you from sweating as much. Read the labels. You can find them in the same isle as deodorants. Also, the back label tells you how strong it is, the closer the active ingredient is to 20%, the better it will work. Try an antiperspirant, if thats still not strong enough, you might need to get one that says "clinical strength" and you can also find those in the same spot at nearly any store. Clinical strength antiperspirants are meant to be used at night because it is when you are less active and it allows for the antiperspirant to make a layer that will stop you from sweating as much. I like to use one that is called certain-dry. I recommend it BUT be careful not to use it right after shaving because it will irritate really bad and burn. Usually what i do is wait 1 day after shaving then wear it the next night and so on until i shave again and then i wait another day before starting to use it again. good luck. :)
v6EDfqffaa	yupps. just take off white leather boots. those dont sound to good. <br>  : /|`|7ysHDLWCaa	ya but instead of high-waisted skirts, go for a young look. a low waisted mini skirt maybe? and with vans and skinnys you'll totally be trendy|`|oquBKA4naa	It really depends on the girl I guess. If she's really into fashion than yeah this looks about normal, for someone who loves fashion. <br>  <br>  She has good taste.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	I'm not sure about the white leather boots :\<br>  And, I dno about a silver leather jacket, to me it sounds a bit over the top, but I have never seen one on so yeah.<br>  <br>  Also, do you really need black stiletto's at 15? Heals are fine, but I think stiletto's can look skanky when you start wearing them everyday. But, if your thinking of having them in the cupboard for special occassions, parties, etc. then I think go for it.|`|xN2JUcmvaa	I love your style! It's good if that's what you normally wear.

It sounds oddly like my own shopping list, hmmmm.  Just one thing, I too love high waists but a normal waist floral skirt?  Kinda depends on the skirt.

KfzuzB47aa	flip your head over and grab all of your hair like your gonna put it in a ponytail then twist it a couple times to hold the bottom together and twist your hair around that and put a hair tie on then thats a bun. or instead of twisting it around your hair use the hair tie like your doing a pony tail and on the last loop dont pull your hair all the way through and loosen it and mess with it till you get it the way you want it. you might also find some stuff on youtube.com|`|fJYReshoaa	easy grab it and wrap it around a few times i h8 buns they make ur hair all raty and knotty
ddXQeEvNaa	I bought this natural salt rock from GNC. It's $4.00, you just wet it, run it over your pits like a normal deodorant, and it blocks odor all day. The salts and crystals naturally cancel out smell. I wouldn't use it if you were a heavy sweater though, I use regular deodorant on the days I have games. But one little rock will last you over a year.|`|dq2FWlebaa	Honestly, there is nothing other than a deoderant that works as one.

fP5SqgKLaa	You don't just have to pick one or the other, you can mix and match. You should try and choose several base items (pants or shirts). And then choose several different blouses, sweaters, skirts, shoes, or whatever that accentuates the style you want. This way, you don't have to chose just one style, but you also don't have to by two or three different wardrobes.|`|zico37Kkaa	1 I'm 17 too and these are both such cute looks. But with red hair and fair skin I'd go with the first one. The second look will just be VERY dramatic. I think the creams and blues would be a classy and beautiful, natural look, which is pretty much always the way to go. You don't really want to look like a overtired raccoon while going for a girly look.|`|Pylil129aa	if you want a mix, try grays and light silvers.<br>  cream and blue will make your hair stand out but blacks will not your outer appearance<br>  black and cream is a great mix|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	I think the best choice is #1, since you are fair with red hair.  Choice #2 is too dark for you. That doesn't mean you can't have that goth look every once in a while.|`|3dbZdwGLaa	mix and match dark and light colors <br>  it'll bring each other out<br>  both looks really pretty and workable

Well, actually no, it won't be too much. You'll look great! And way different.

Wear whatever you want! Go out there and just have some fun! <br>  :)|`|fjTVAbdBaa	I think it is are really cool dress. I also think it may be a pain in the a**.

eow59EaEaa	I personally do not think that the Airflash is worth $60. You could buy Armani Luminous Silk Foundation and get a lovelier finish for that price point.<br>  <br>  I don't like the O-Glow either. I would rather go with a Tarte Cheekstain. They have a new one that has two colors mixed and it gives a nice deeper rosy color as opposed to the bubblegum pink the O-Glow gives.|`|OGVxrWtEaa	About DiorSkin AirFlash Spray Foundation - I have not used it personally..I was going to try it because I wanted an air brush look too.

I hope I helped you about the AirFlash Spray foundation =)|`|VDWFRNHWaa	I used to work for Dior and i honestly think it depends on your skin type. This was one of the foundations I used on customers that wanted full coverage! It has a pearl like shimmer in it to give you a flawless look and comes in 4 different shades. It does stay on pretty well but can look cakey! If you do decide to buy it apply it with a kabuki brush, not a sponge. A sponge will absorb the whole thing and you can say goodbye to your $60. They advertise it so you think you should spray it on but realistically its going to get all over your hair and eyelashes! Its a great foundation to have for SPECIAL occasions! I mean $60 special occasions! It does stay on all day (most dior foundations do!)Other than that if you want your face to have that full coverage look everyday you might at well head on over to MAC. Studio makeup usually equals pretty heft coverage.<br>  <br>  Try Dior's FOREVER foundation!<br>  That is great coverage and works amazing as well!

While women's casual business attire is typically on the conservative side, there are also ways to personalize your outfits with your own style and still maintain an appropriate professional look.<br>  Try to go for<br>   Tailored shirts or blouses<br>   Tailored sweaters or sweater sets<br>   Knee length or just above the knee length skirts<br>   Dress pants or slacks<br>   Coordinated business separates<br>   Two piece dresses (dresses with coordinated jackets)<br>   or Ladies dress suits <br>  <br>  Clothing colors should largely be kept conservative. Solid neutral colors are appropriate for most items, such as grey, black, navy, and tan. If you love color and are looking for a way to liven up your look, colored or print blouses or shells can be worn under solid color jackets or cardigans. Twill, corduroy, and khaki can be part of a women's business casual wardrobe as well.

Just dont try to pop them, repeat dont try to pop them because cystic acne is really deep down your pores(thats why they scar) I also used diffren adapalene gel and a benzoyl peroxide 10% for day and night wash.

BbqSapJIaa	I would suggest you start off with a basic set of brushes. You can get these at a drugstore, and it basically comes with a blush or powder brush, an eyeshadow brush, a brush for the lips, and an eyebrow comb. They have tons of variety so look around, and most of them are quite cheap which is good for beginning.<br>  <br>  Try buying eyeshadow sets, that have 3 or 4 different colors. Some of these come with instructions to help you master blending, and eyeshadow technique. I don't suggest anything to expensive, maybe a drugstore brand or something cheaper from Sephora or another make-up store. Basically you use the lightest color first as a base, and blend it from your eyelash line to your eyebrow. Second lightest color goes on your crease well blended, and the darkest shade can be used as eyeliner, along your last line or as a shadow where you just blend it on top of your crease.  <br>  <br>  Liquid liner is in my opinion much better then cream or stick eyeliner, but its hard to work with. Buy a soft eyeliner stick, and use it right on top of your lash line blending it a touch with a Q-tip or sponge, and underneath your eyes. Again, any drugstore would carry all colors of eyeliner. As for mascara, it depends on what you want. You can volumize, curl or lengthen your eyelashes, so find the mascara that best suits your need. Now they have tons of other kinds to add shimmer to your eyelashes, and make them look a different tone. I suggest either Maybelline, or MAC. <br>  <br>  Try to stick with neutral tones, and only put your make - up on lightly. Bronze, golds and earth tones work great for everyone. If you wanted to wear foundation or concealer, make sure it blends in really well and matches your natural skin tone. Light colored blush on the apples of your cheeks, and a touch of lip gloss.|`|5viX2saAaa	I say start with bare escentuals.  There beginner kit is amazing, and has everything that you need to get started for foundation.  For $60, you get 2 different colors of foundation, a sort of bronzer, and mineralveil, which kind of takes out the oil of your skin and helps to keep your foundation on all day.  It also comes with three brushes.  The people who work there are usually really nice and well help you find your color.  For eyeliner, i use maybelline define-a-line, which is better then the MAC eyeliner i used to use and one-third the price.  It comes in a green tube and comes with a smudger and a sharpener, all for around $5.  For eyeshadow, your best bet is sephora.  One of the workers will show you a good color for your skin tone.  I like Urban Decay eyeshadows, as well as Bare Escentuals.  For blush, I like Cargo, which is from Sephora.  If your looking for something cheaper, try something from the kiddy makeup kits. I use that blush all the time, and it looks about the same.  Good Luck!|`|oYcmKpT1aa	I'm a big eyeshadow and mascara girl. When i first started out i just went straight for drugstore makeup and department stuff but now i found out a better way. Especially for beginners, you should check out the dollar tree and pick up some of the LA colors pallets for $1 each. I heard they're VERY pigmented (colored) and are even better than the ELF collection. By buying this, you can experiment with colors without having to overspend. You can see which colors you like as well as which ones look best on you. Then you can move on to drugstore brands and other bigger brands like MAC.|`|YG4Th6Rqaa	Try coastalscents.com excellent colors and very dheap (eye shadows) make sure to get makeup brushes as well. look on youtube for makeup tips|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  All you need is<br>  <br>  1. liquid foundation<br>  2. eyeliner  liquid or pencil  (this comes with a brush)<br>  3.

Eye liner pencil if you are not going to use the liquid eyeliner<br>  6. eye makeup remover<br>  <br>  Good soap to removal facial makeup|`|r5c20sY1aa	this depends on your age. <br>  <br>  If you are young 13-18 then begin with sheer and translucients. Use colors that heighten your natural color. When you are 16 you can begin using colors that distract from natural colors like hues of blue and green. After 16 try even bolder colors such as yellows and blacks with darker hues. <br>  You can get by with just about anything up until you are 25. exagerations should only be used when going out and the place you are parting is mostly dark lit. Otherwise blend blend blend. After 25 you have to go back to more neutral colors whoch enhance your natural colors and looks. All powders before 30. Begin to experiment with cremes after 30 and definitely use them after 40. Makeup cakes in lines so less is always more after 40. Use foundation sparingly. <br>  <br>  Go to Sally's and purchase every single makeup brush they have. Buy three of the shading brushes. Each brush will tell you what they do. Now is the time for you to have fun and experiment. If you are young, have a few friends over and just put on makeup to see how it looks. Blend.....Blend.....Blend. When blending move in circular motions ending upward. <br>  <br>  Makeup is different for most people. So, you will have to figure out which brands work best for you. Great Lash Mascara ( in the pink tube) is the best and is used by people both wealthy and broke because...it is definitely the best.<br>  <br>  Lipsticks are basically the same but some people prefer to use a lip pencil lightly applied with a clear gloss over it (guys hate gloss. never attempt to kiss a guy with gloss on your lips. Girls love it but guys hate it)<br>  <br>  Think of your face as a blank canvas. Enjoy and have fun!

aQrURNqHaa	A really good primer is  MAC Prep+Prime Skin.  A good foundation that isn't too thick and stays on is Clinique's Moisture Sheer Tint and for a finishing powder the mineral veil that was mentioned works great.  However everyone's skin type is different and it would probably be best to go to a makeup counter at a  dept. store and try out different types. Have fun!|`|xDoJK2gTaa	loreal true match super blendable powder its great|`|bI7yzhkTaa	Well that all depends on how much money you want to spend. I personally love Bobbi Brown cosmetics. The make up looks really natural. I use Clinique sheer pressed powder to make the make up last a little longer and Mac primer only on special ocassions. First you have to determine your skin type. If you have oily skin you must use oil free foundation otherwise it will rub off. I have oily skin and that was happening to me until someone giuded me in the right direction. What you shoulod do is go into Sephora, talk to one of the sales people and tell them what your looking for. They shoulod be able to guide you. If you buy something from a Dept. store you could always return the product for a full refund which is nice. I would ask the people at Sephora for samples of different kinds of foundation. Take them home and try them to see which works best for you and take it from there.<br>  You should not have to use foundation, it isn't really until you get older that you should need it. Instead go to Bobbi Brown and pick up a bronzer and a pretty blush and wallah! you'll be surprised at the way you will look.|`|e3zlkAoVaa	That one stuff that is like cream, then when you put it on it turns into liquid.<br>  <br>  or you can try MY FAVORITE!

iRZ4Y2bLaa	ok.<br>  <br>  Try using a light gold color for your eye shadow. No eye liner. Depending on  the shape of your eyes you may want to underline your eyes with black mascara. but this is only likely on the shape of your eyes.<br>  <br>  To enhance your eyes you should use fake eye lashes that come in segments. Stay away from the the whole over dramatic lashes.<br>  <br>  Use a light color of eyes shadow to put under the end arch of your eyebrows. A pale color, Not White. Tan is recommended.<br>  <br>  One Trick that you could use is instead of using  eyebrow liner, use mascara because it stays on your eyebrows and does not rub off.<br>  <br>  You may want to use a tiny dab of dark red lipstick, just a dab. Use something to spread it around to cover your entire lips. Make sure that it is VERY light. Use lip gloss over that.<br>  <br>  Since you are wearing a red dress, Very lightly  dust dark blush; red, pink or anything in that pigment on your cheeks. Make sure that you smile when applying it and also make sure that you dust it up towards the tip of your ears.<br>  <br>  Presto! you are ready to make them drool!<br>  <br>  Best of Wishes!|`|JcUCMqVJaa	id say NO colors<br>  be very sunkissed with bold lashes and a nude/pinky lip<br>  look like a fresh dewy face (hayden panitere or rihanna) not some tacky green dress green eyeshadow over kill we see REPEATEDLY<br>  =]|`|BFbJvHFBaa	hmm<br>  well if u need help with that then u should go to nessasarymakeup.com/<br>  its a perfect fabulous website <br>  <br>  hope u have a good time at prom<br>  <br>  xoxo sierra|`|Pylil129aa	uhm gold would be best with your dress<br>  with red your brows and lashes will wash out so make it dark but NOT thick|`|XC8FsGvnaa	purple, green, blue...pretty much any color except brown. i like purple personally. wait...no pink, orange or gold.|`|yWoK9ryJaa	This is a beautiful tutorial that would look stunning on your coloring.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a>|`|GnT2CnhBaa	because your dress is red, which is quite standoutish. i would go for more natural.<br>  <br>  flawless skin<br>  just use a very natural colour, almost the colour of your skin, eyeshadow over your entire eyelid and just over the crease.<br>  a very fine line on your top lashline, use a eyelash curler and then mascara for nice big lashes.<br>  dont put eyeliner on your lower lashline, leave that bare and just use a creamy pink or nuetral colour inside the inner rim of your lower lashes. (it makes your eyes pop and look brighter and awake)<br>  use a skin tone lip liner and colour OR a pale pink lip glaze/stain.<br>  use a illumiser on your cheek bones, along the bridge of your nose, and just under your eyebrow (on the outer side of your eyebrows) you can also use a tiny bit of it on your ''cupids bow'' (just above your top lip)
6uZULSzMaa	i think it depends on the person.  just like you said, you might think that way about someone wearing heels to the grocery store, the person wearing heels in the grocery stores might see you and wonder why you're wearing a full face of make up there as well.  i think it goes any way you want it to, for anyone doing whatever they're doing.  it might just be your thing to wear smokey eye make up with glitter whenever you feel like it.<br>  <br>  i think the usual norm is that people don't expect each other to wear full faces of make up, or wear heels to the grocery store, or dye their hair hot pink, or what have you.  and with all of those things that we think is not totally necessary, we try to find reasons to understand why this person might be doing that.<br>  <br>  i know some people who do things like that in order to make themselves feel better and helps their insecurity with whatever it might be.  and maybe you just do it because it's what makes you happy, but i'm sure a lot of other people do it to try to cover something up, whether it be blemishes and bad skin, or something about their personality.  personally, i think that even though a person has their own thing that they like to do with their physical appearance, their actions are what lets other people know what the real reason is for doing it.  know what i mean?<br>  <br>  i also have a BA in the field of communication among people and we study stuff about why people do those things.  and hey maybe it's just a way to express how they feel that day, or their interests and what they like.  or it could be something totally different going on with their personal life.  everybody has their own thing that they do or don't do.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	I don't really think people sit back and say "oh wow, that person is sooo insecure" when they see a woman with a full face of makeup on. It really depends on the individual and how they see makeup in the first place. If a person sees makeup as a way to hide from themself then they can see a person as being insecure; if they see makeup as an artistic outlet, they could think that person is creative; and if a person thinks of makeup as another way to take care of yourself, then someone could think it means that you have high self-esteem. I personally think of makeup as being an artistic outlet and using your face as a canvas so I'm always interested in the way that people do their makeup, and my boyfriend thinks of makeup as an extension of taking care of yourself, so he sees it as a person with high self-esteem. <br>  <br>  Ask your professor why he/she would think doing one's makeup is considered an act of a person that is insecure. Does he/she think someone that curls their hair as insecure too?|`|jWmnSXlLaa	the past year or so I always wear makeup I don't like to not wear it. My husband doesn't understand why.

I dont see anything wrong with it. We are woman so why not wear makeup? I go to college and work every day with full makeup (foundation, eye makeup and eye liner).  We are pretty, but it makes us even more prettier. Some girls dont like doing it, but most of the time those are the girls who need to wear makeup lol... but your fine and I dont think it's weird =D|`|TR5ntsavaa	I don't think it's weird or insecure, but then again, I'm the same way. I think I'm pretty without makeup (I'm not trying to sound conceited, people have told me I'm pretty), but I think I'm prettier with it. Plus I think it's fun to put on. Frankly, I think that if someone thinks I'm insecure because I wear a lot of makeup, that's their problem. If they knew me they would know that's not why I wear it, and if they don't know me I'm not going to be too concerned about them thinking I might be insecure.
eow59EaEaa	You could actually make your own! If there is a Sally Beauty Supply near you, they have large jars of cosmetic glitter and a little tube of gel that adheres the glitter to your face for $1.00 each! They have lots of pretty colors and it will last you a long time.<br>  <br>  Just get a slanted eyeliner brush and dip it into the clear gel. Get a good amount on your lashline. Then take the same brush and get some glitter on it and tap it to get any access of. Instead of "brushing" the glitter over the gel, "pat" it bit by bit to really get a concentrated look. The extra time is worth the $14.00 you will save by making your own!|`|UuLZBX9daa	<a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P223714&categoryId=S10503&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  The Sephora Brand is a little bit more affordable|`|3atgzahdaa	yeapyeapp if you stop by walmart or one of the little shops in the mall, sometimes they have them.

Darling, you're not ready for makeup if all you want to do is cover things up. Makeup should be used NOT on a regular basis, and only to emphasize/highlight your best facial assets. :) You need to feel beautiful without makeup, and makeup needs to be the tool you use to emphasize your pre-existing beauty.<br>  <br>  That's just how I feel.<br>  <br>  And I just realised I didn't answer this question. lol.<br>  <br>  Just.. if you guys ever go to the mall together, just tell her you think you want to look at some makeup now, and I think she'll understand.|`|def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	sounds like your mom already thinks you'll be ready to try make up.<br>  <br>  ask her if she'll take you shopping instead.<br>  <br>  it's pretty difficult to cover freckles, i'd know. lol i have a lot of beauty marks and freckles on my face. :)<br>  they don't really bother me though, no one has ever picked on me about them and i think that my beauty marks are pretty and unique. <br>  <br>  A face without freckles is like a night with out stars :D|`|QZnekv7aaa	Just compare it to asking her to wear a thong.

Look at all the crazy names listed here....it's almost as if we were reading a list of names that was written up by a bunch of drunks. You are still a child yourself.  I hope you are focusing way more attention on how you are going to raise this baby and future plans for you and your boyfriend, vs. these incredibly silly names. But, that aside, IF I had to pick ONE.....<br>  <br>  Grace<br>  OR.....<br>  Dean<br>  <br>  And go with the Whitehorse or the Guitar as a middle name, please.....You don't want to be saying, "What was I thinking?????"|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	Whitehorse Grace (girls)<br>  Polar Aristotale (boys) Though i would choose Justin!|`|NCvX4I0baa	You're making pregnant teens more of a joke than it already could possibly be. You're trying too hard to be unique. If you were truely unique you'd find the easiest ways to be unique without going crazy. You're also being selfish and only thinking of how "creative" you want to be. What about the REST OF YOUR CHILD'S LIFE? they have to live their life being called these names. Think about it.|`|saQqUUWxaa	wow if you name your child any of those names,take my word for it,he or she WILL get made fun of!! think of the child! thats terrible! <br>  those names are outrageous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  oh my god did you say "fearless fifteen"<br>  rnt those taylor swifts songs?......... wwwwoooooowwwww<br>  <br>  edit: by those names,you can tell that obviously YOU ARE STUPID and maybe YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR GOD DAMNN LEGS CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA10623334	YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE NAME BECUZ THIS NAME WILL EFFECT YOUR CHILDS LIFE FOREVER !!!<br>  <br>  THINK IT OVA FOR AWHILE|`|Ict5JA4eaa	lol@pregnant at 17|`|N89HLv92aa	ok you must be kidding right? The only name I see acceptable on your list is McGraw Stephen.  Why would you want to name your kid after the Devil?? Also why would you want to name your kid Giant Banana?? Grow up! You can pick something else thats not common but not stupid either. Do you really not have anything better to do. You are sooo not ready to be a mother. I hope this is a joke, because there is no way you should have a kid, being a immature as you are.|`|4aGoWKtEaa	There are so many reasons why you shouldn't name them that. Here are some good exotic names. Your child is going to be made fun of all because of his mommy giving him a retarded name. Face it life is cruel. Wtf are you doing at 17 with a child.<br>  <br>  Girls<br>  Ceclia<br>  Carmen- There aren't many carmens like before<br>  Chrystee<br>  <br>  Boys<br>  Abraham<br>  Aiden<br>  Alfonso<br>  Dylan<br>  Eduardo<br>  Edgar|`|BHeBSGemaa	Your child will resent you forever. That's why. You shouldn't be having children.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Ha! I like Peppermint Drew! Do it.|`|AA12116854	Hey, there's nothing wrong if you hope to make your child the laughingstock of his/her entire peer group and generation. But then I also am sick of the Brittneys, Brittanys, Ashleys, Kirstens, etc., Oh, and don't forget the lovely "unique" names like Apple.<br>  Hey, why not try "grapefruit" or "Enema"? There used to be a song in the late 1970's/early 80's called "Teenage Enema Nurse"! That could be your kid's theme song!|`|iYI5TXCMaa	Hey there I first want to say that I'm sorry that you had to read all of the arrogant people making fun and being judgemental (and... well assholes). I have to admit a few of the names you chose are a little silly lol but there were also a lot that I would like to have myself. <br>  for a girl (I'll give you top three for each): <br>  Peppermint Drew<br>  Australia Kitten<br>  Sunnyman Rose although I might go with sunshine instead?<br>  for a boy:<br>  Hornet Frankfurt I really like this one!<br>  Polar Aristotale<br>  Guitar Dean<br>  Well, I hope I was helpful! <br>  Oh and if your wondering, I'm 17 too : ]|`|mjBBWgZGaa	I think it doesn't matter what other people think, but you need to think of the child. I know that I wouldn't like those names. I think people who name their kids weird names are just dying to be something new and different. The truth is everyone can name their kids "Dinky Dong" and what have you. Think about the child though, would he like that name when he goes to a job interview or spending time with friends? Or do you have no job and no friends to understand. Seriously, wake the hell up.|`|vgsVMRmwaa	About the only ones I could put-up with were Sensual Amber, which is unique (you're right) but actually isn't ridiculous; Polar Aristotale; and, ironically, Peppermint Drew... <br>  <br>  But those names SOUND so fictitious, so strange, that it is as if they came from a child's story... Strawberry Shortcake, etc.|`|27hANXS4aa	Don't worry your child will just hate you for the rest of its life.<br>  <br>  Funny how you mention you hate the name chris.Mocking the name of the baby's dad. Im sure your baby's daddy appreciates that.<br>  <br>  Sad that this is what the worlds coming to. First it gets a horrible name. Then its going to have an as*hole for a mother. Im scared for the future.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt be reproducing.|`|45753f55ccb1ad5a62d9c5d3422416efaa	i think that that's ridiculous if you'd name your child giant banana or something like that. you're obviously not taking your pregnancy seriously, you shouldn't even be having a baby at 17. you could do something unique yet NORMAL! like a name of a tree or flower i.e. - birch, rose, etc.|`|9wItgN6Taa	Well Scott is a great name, has done me well lol i've only met a few other scotts at all the schools i've been too in the Bay area, So*Cal and now Western Nevada....plus scott is just an awesome name lol but seriously those names will have ur child picked on sooo often, it sucks being the butt of everyone's jokes (elementary school sucked! lol)|`|AA10484566	I feel sorry for your kid. I mean seriously!? do you hate them?  You can name them something unique, but not that ridiculously unique.  They will be teased at for the rest of their lifes by any one who knows those names, and when they want to and know they can they will change their names|`|PZ0o5ZDraa	If you name him something bizarre like that, I can almost guarantee that he will be mocked and made fun of at school. Even common names get made fun of all the time. Think of the child before naming him something that will make you laugh or smile. Seriously, though. Banana? : /|`|R4QXpdCraa	I think unique names are cool. i especially like the name peppermint drew but it would be cuter for a girl. i like your style. :D go for it. its america free country.|`|aCrILRS9aa	peppermint drew and australia kitten but instead of australia make it australian|`|nRT7sPXQaa	Well it's clear you're taking this pregnancy seriously.|`|4b0af5311f2d55ba03672ac9a75178b8aa	my friend wants to name his daughter karma|`|PJzrBkpEaa	lol your kid is gonna hate u|`|67yhjaaIaa	those r really unique some of them r really cute too <br>  but others r a bit extreme. <br>  i know wat its like to have a unique name....<br>  my name is bagira (ik sounds weird) <br>  its pronounced (ba-gi-ra) ( the g sounds like the g in groundhog not giant. its 2 diff sounds u know? ... prob not) <br>  the name from the jungle book of the panther. <br>  o and im a girl <br>  so yea<br>  and i dont think people should b making fun of ur choices for names i mean its ur opinion u know?|`|99193d34fb187b6ea3af8b00a6a9ce62aa	You don't have to name your child something "typical" but think about it.  I understand that at your age you think some of those names are cool, and a few of them aren't as ridiculous as others...but come on now, hun. Think about the future of your child. Do you want people to laugh at him/her?  They will.  Do you want people to label him or her because of what the name is?  They will. You may say you don't care now, but trust me when you're a mom you want to protect your sweet kids from all the mean people and you will regret labeling your child with a name which will indeed cause him/her so much pain. Being a teenager is hard enough without a name like "Fearless Fifteen".  Don't do that to the poor child.  There are websites that offer some interesting/rocker/cool names. Check those out.  Don't name your kid something that sounds like it's a porn star name or something just plain stupid.  Be a great mom, that's the way to gain attention.  Beat the odds.  Prove to everyone that tells you that you're going to fail that they're wrong.  It's time to grow up and take responsibility for someone very precious.  Your child won't be like everyone else if you raise him or her to be a unique and creative individual.  His name has NOTHING to do with what he's going to grow up to be. Be repsonsible. Please! (I like Jersey and McGraw).
N9HU02Qbaa	uhh, yeah. im kinda into that trend.<br>  anyways, i WOULD wear that, but if you can find a plain old black tie of your dads or brothers or something. do not wear it without. cuz if you do, you will look prep (which shall die), casual or just girly.<br>  <br>  or, wear a black camisole on top.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  diggin the converse  <3|`|MSqE9rbDaa	SO cute! :)<br>  Make sure the shirt isn't tight, though.<br>  Those kind look good a little loose.<br>  (Not baggy, though!)<br>  <br>  And I'm not the biggest fan of the wrist sweat band thingy.

taiUszpjaa	The best face pack for oily skin is <br>  1.fullers' earth with lemon juice .. you can even extract some juice from fresh mint and apply it on your face for 10 mins.. it gives excellent results..<br>  2.Tomatoes are oily skins' best friend.. :) Simple one: Cut a tomatoe in half.. Take each piece of tomatoe in your palm and start rubbing it onto your face.. till it gets quoted with tomatoe juice all over..<br>  3.To remove blemishes and to protect your skin, Apply honey all over your face and leave for ten mins.. wash with cool water<br>  4.Take some green tea extract and use it as a toner..<br>  5.boil some potatoes..

stKD9rgcaa	You don't need to use any kind of antibacterial spray, and you shouldn't.<br>  <br>  It is safe to use the sea salt soak everyday.<br>  <br>  You *do* need unscented antibacterial soap to clean it with 3 times a day. It's easy enough to get. But to make sure that it doesn't get infected - antibacterial soap is a must.|`|f65fe6708c96316f9a9cb1729c261f7baa	i just washed it with anitbacterial soap in the shower <br>  but i would do both|`|rVf708pwaa	The more the better so I say put both on.|`|hPDxOTMKaa	You want to soak your piercing for 2-4 times a day (no more...if you over clean it it's just as bad as not cleaning it!!) You want to mix 1/4 teaspoon with 1 cup of water (I use hot to help dissolve the salt) and you want to make sure the salt is NON-Iodized salt. For the belly button, I would just put the mixture into a shot glass, and invert it on your belly button and just hold it there for 10 minutes. I don't think it matters if it's distilled water or not... If you get crusty stuff on it between your cleaning period (maybe just once a day or so..) get a q-tip and use the solution to gently clear it. The biggest thing is to not play with it, and always wash your hands before you touch it. Also, do not soak in a tub, or go swimming for 4-6 weeks (I think..) Hope this helped. Good luck!<br>  <br>  I never used the soap for any of my piercings and it was fine. The salt soak is all that you need.
FrG9a5o3aa	Why is this question in the make up category?<br>  <br>  I think you have been misled.<br>  <br>  ..........Nerd.
jt55tkDnaa	Putting make up on it will slow the healing process down severely. When i get one of those kinds of pimples I clean with hydrogen peroxide first then put some neosporin on it and leave it on for a few hours or sometimes even over night and that speeds up the healing process like you wouldnt believe. You want it to heal not get worse and if you keep scrubbing the scab off you will have a nasty scar where the pimple was. Trust me I have had enough of these to know. And people at school are not going to care, just suck it up and deal with it until it heals you. Plus makeup only makes those look worse.|`|0x7ItPNlaa	Yeah, Micah sounds like a guy's name, so you could say that you cut yourself shaving until the scar heals. But on Neutrogena's website they have an Acne Mark Fading Peel (there's something wrong with my browser so I can't see the URL). That should work to get the mark off.|`|xDoJK2gTaa	i agree with the above|`|l8yfpyy1aa	You could get one of those Band-Aid assortments that includes small round bandages.  Put on one of those, and say you cut yourself shaving (I'm assuming "Micah" is a boy's name.) <br>  <br>  Even on a girl's face, such a Band-Aid would be less conspicuous than makeup over a scab.  The sore place will heal better, too.|`|SRF2FiWPaa	---- wear a bandaid--- don't worry about make up as this could infect it but make up will not heal it--- use medicated stuff to try to heal it--- I would suggest you try zinc ointment and zinc tablets--- and seeing a dermatologist --- but I would suggest bandaid-- also don't apply zinc ointment on it just yet-- zinc ointment- diaper rash stuff--apply zinc ointment on other parts of your body until you see how it applies -- thin layers will be absorbed-- if you apply lots it would have to be "scrapped off" and this would damage any wounded skin-- also try lots of vitamin C. good luck

I can personally say from experience that I have yet to run into any major problems. I have a degree in chemistry, and just began Medical School. I have 19 tattoos, including one on my hand and my neck. I had no problems with getting into a hospital for my residency.. In fact, a lot of people there are fascinated by it.<br>  <br>  But as previously suggested, go with the inside of your wrist, or upper arm. Somewhere that can be easily covered up.|`|JmbtwvmOaa	A lot of people have the same concerns as you do about getting a tattoo. The fact that you're considering the impact the tattoo will have on your life shows you've actually thought about it, which is good.<br>  <br>  The type of tattoo you're interested in is quite easily concealed by a watch or a bracelet. The type of tattoo you're considering is really popular, and some are having the same size image put behind their ear.<br>  <br>  Usually, even the most persnickety of individuals would not say anything about an image that small and inconspicuous, unless it is something x-rated.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, and you don't wear a watch, grab a box of those round Band Aids and pop one over it. If your interviewer asks what happened to your wrist, just tell them what's under there and tell them you didn't what to offend them. Even if they don't like tattoos, there's a good chance they'll look over it just because you were so darn considerate of their opinion.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and best of luck to you!|`|avOojOkZaa	I work both as an employer and a person that is tattooed. The amount of tolerance has to do with the job. Certain professions will experience problems with tattoos. Most people would not their Dr., Lawyer, or pre school teacher to have a visible FTW tattoo.On the other hand you would not flinch if your mechanic, plumber, or your trendy store employee had tattoos. Since you are thinking about your wrist think about the inside of your left wrist. The inside of the wrist is nearly impossible to spot and once you wear a watch over it it can be near impossible to spot at work. one of my fellow managers has a tattoo inside his wrist and it is impossible to see at work. On the other hand you could always get something bigger and better in a location that would be private.|`|wufKLi6Haa	I have a tattoo on the inside of my left wrist and so far I haven't had much trouble. If I am worried about it at anytime, I wear a watch. That is just my suggestion.<br>  <br>  As long as the tattoo isn't anything offensive, you should be okay. At least with my experience...|`|HnBnoqILaa	I have very small japenese letter on the back of my neck..my hair can cover it up if need be, but I have never had a bad reaction about it. If anything people talk about how cute it is.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I don't think there is a problem. Some employers clearly frown upon it because it tends to look unprofessional-especially if it's in a place that isn't hidden.<br>  <br>  I work in an office and there are several people with tattoos, including myself. They are pretty laid back where I work but some other places of work don't like it.<br>  <br>  You won't be looked down upon. This is 2009. Tattoos are normal-everyone-almost everyone-gets them. <br>  <br>  I'm a respectable moral person and I have a tattoo. Getting a tattoo doesn't lessen your morals or values as a person. <br>  <br>  I think you are more concerned with what others will think of you. Don't get one if you are a sensitive person.
gQi0TxTIaa	i think it's a good idea

c5anDswjaa	Well one, you should definitely go back to your shop and pitch a fit, see what they can do about it.. The skin tries to grow over the ball? Maybe you should get a longer barbell put in there.. My right nipple was pretty angry for a while, so I put small band-aids over the entrance/exit holes so my bra wouldnt be rubbing against it, and boy did that help.. Amp up your intake of vitamin C, it will help you heal faster.. I also use antibacterial soap, and its worked well for me.. Hope your nip gets better soon!|`|nTSjPOYQaa	Yikes, that sounds painful. Its good you're doing the sea salt soaks, I was going to recommend that. Its obvious that it being pierced is causing some problems, female nipple piercings should never go through the areola. If the lady that pierced you is reputable, go back to her and ask for help. If not, find a really great piercer and get some help. Your piercing is bound to get infected at this rate, but please do not remove it if it does because that will trap the infection in the breast. An infected nipple piercing gets very serious very quickly. Another thing, is your barbell long enough to allow room for swelling? You might want to ask a piercer to insert a different length barbell. I really don't know what else to tell you because it sounds like you're taking good care of it, but it was just pierced incorrectly. Good luck.|`|jh8vWqQzaa	first, it's not uncommon for one side to hurt worse than the other. 2nd, it's possible that barbells might not have been the right choice for you.  the skin 'trying' to grow around it tells me  that either the barbell is too short or your nipple are too flat for barbells. (keep in mind that without seeing them, I'm kind of guessing.)  <br>  'puss' is normal. it is important that your sea salt mixture is correct:  1/8 to 1/4 tsp per 8oz warm distilled water.  invert the cup over your nipples and soak for 3 to 5 minutes, 3 - 5 times a day (as opposed to spraying or wiping.)<br>  give it time. it can take up to and over a year to heal completely.<br>  by the way, the 'puss' you see is what dries and turns into crusties.<br>  IMPORTANT:  do not use antibacterial soap.  antimicrobial soap is what you want, although, i just use a mild soap like Dove.  antibacterial soaps actually prevent new skin cells from forming, thus, prolonging healing time as well as making the area more prone to infection.  I see a lot of people recommending antibacterial soap on this website, and it's kind of frustrating.  please trust me on this one. don't use it.<br>  finally, if you continue to have problems, you may want to talk to a good piercer in your area.  you can find one by visitin the APP website, safepiercing.org.  there you can find an APP piercer in your area.  APP piercers are the most knowledgeable and current piercers out there. there are several newish products outt there that a lot of people aren't familiar with, such as Emu Oil.  good luck

FOCpoUZpaa	it is very important to keep it clean.<br>  use saline solution, sea salt and warn water.and if it bleeds don't worry, warn water compress with a cotton ball and clean hands.<br>  <br>  For the pain take ibuprofen. It will take a while because you are forcing it to stretch, it is expensive this way but the process is less painful. don't skip sizes go down the line, 10, 8....etc<br>  <br>  gauges are tiiight, good job for nothing just wearing faux ones. :P|`|nTSjPOYQaa	It sounds like you skipped sizes. It should never hurt when you stretch. You should downsize at least one size immediately so you don't risk getting a blow out. As for cleaning, you can wash with antibacterial soap. The most important cleaning routine you need to do is a daily sea salt soak. Add 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt (not table salt) to a cup of warm water, and you can either dunk your piercing into it, or use a q-tip to dab some on.|`|jh8vWqQzaa	the above advise is good.  i very strongly recommend soaking the piercing rather than dabbing it with a qtip.

And, quit being a bone head. go to a pro|`|SQmWPaYzaa	Get a smaller one, you can tear your ear up. Taking a warm bath/shower can help too, it will soften the skin and make the pain go away a bit.

LDjAF93Naa	I think that you should wear something glamorous/hot but it should be what you want to wear. and if i was you i would snap on all them haters but that's just me. i don't think you should wear a certain brand to fit in. i myself do wear hollister, and abercrombie but i have other brands also. i Attend  a school in the suburbs and like everyone wears<br>  hollister, and abercrombie, i think if your whole wardrobe is hollister and abercrombie you should buy other brands and it may just because your trying to fit in. also the kids that attend my school that only wear hollister and abercrombie etc most of the time wear the same thing each week because they cant afford to buy five pairs of thirty dollar pants and ten thirty dollar shirts. i hope ppl can see my point, but this is just facts from where i live and my own opinions! thx!<br>  <br>  with the hair i have naturally curly hair and i always straighten it and then curl it,with the color {if you do dye your hair, this will damage it!} i think you should maybe get highlights. my Natural hair color is like dark brown but ive always dyed my hair lighter like light brown, light auburn and i really like the out come. i guess it really depends on your style <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|QOsewJqWaa	prove to them through the way you act.<br>  i tried to do the whole "ill change the way people think by changing my style"<br>  <br>  doesnt really change anything, people will just think your a poser.<br>  <br>  and dont dye your hair.<br>  please.<br>  it would just look fake.<br>  <br>  stay true to who you are.|`|e7yFahGraa	The best way to build confidence (in this respect) is to wear clothes that YOU like. Don't go for brandnames just for the names. If you like the item of clothing then get it regardless of what name is on it. If you wear the styles you like it'll show that you are independent and unique. You'll also be more comfortable than if you're wearing something you don't like because you're not trying to be someone you're not. The people who dress like everyone else are sheep and too scared to really be themselves. <br>  <br>  It may be difficult, but really try to learn not to listen to what mean people say. High school kids can be real jerks sometimes. They like to bring people down to make themselves feel better because they're insecure. Those kinds of people's opinions don't really matter much, they're idiots. They'll also probably peak in high school and be miserable for the rest of their lives mooning over their lost glory days. <br>  <br>  Just be yourself! I think your hair looks fine the color it is! Embrace yourself and your individuality! Plus, natural hair color is generally the best for one's skin tone. If you get something radically different it could look strange and unnatural. If you really want to do something though, you could get it highlighted. That brings out the natural beauty of it even more! Good luck and forget about the morons!|`|1A1ozEaKaa	all the brands you named are amazing? and for the love of god, don't dye your hair. dios mio! but, above all, you need confidence..there will always be haters but we can't let them get to us. a girl in my 7th grade class (like 5-6 years ago :D) has the nicest clothes imaginable..like you want to steal them, they're so nice. but everyone hated her for on reason. it's lame/redundant, but clothes don't make a person. you do.<br>  <br>  good luck though :)<br>  <br>  PS i love that shirtsweaterthing you're wearing in the picture<br>  <br>  PSS grow out your hair<br>  <br>  :)|`|FGuzsRpJaa	Well hollister and abercrombie aren't the cheapest stores in the world, <br>  You can get like a few jackets from there but Why don't you buy the things that you really like from abercromibe and hollister? I recommend going to like Pac Sun and Zumies  their clothes have a sense of genuine and authenticity to it.

GoPbP1pTaa	Most tanning lotion is good for your skin if it has a moisturizer in it and lots of it has anti aging.  However, tanning is really not good at all for your skin but is not so bad in moderation.  <br>  <br>  This article will tell you everything you need to know about tanning bed lotions and what feature in a lotion does what.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4722816_pick-tanning-bed-lotion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4722816_pick-tan...</a><br>  <br>  to safely tan faster<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4717326_tan-faster.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4717326_tan-fast...</a>|`|qVgr5OBeaa	No, if anything it is good for your skin. It helps protect your skin and nourish it. It can help fight the aging effects you get from UV rays.<br>  And it helps enhance your tan!|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	I think the extended sun exposure is more dangerous than the lotion itself. It can lead to deeper wrinkles earlier on in your life, and possibly skin conditions, the most extreme being skin cancer.|`|FgnAb0Ldaa	All and All tanning is bad for you.  I would use a touch of lotion but not too much, you don't want to tan without anything because that will dry your skin out even more.  Or you can go tanning then put on a hydrate lotion after you are finished tanning|`|YoNMn90Maa	The lotion itself isn't bad for you, it's the tanning.
MCeNakd4aa	well if u want a good straighter that will work for thick hair and save money is a brand called from wet to dry. and they sell it at rite aid for like 20 bucks.it works better then any iron i have used and my hair is very thick. it will keep your hair straighten all day. yea dont waste ur money on some expensive brand. really you will save and get results using from wet to dry straighting iron|`|bO3W5whVaa	The best brand is ghd by far! It is a really high quality brand that produces great results (whether its straightening or curling). They last forever. Have a great warranty. And....... they have a wide range of stylers that suit various hair types.<br>  <br>  In your case it sounds like you'd need either the salon styler or the IV styler as they are more suited for long hair.<br>  <br>  Although, check out the link below and decide for yourself! Hope this helps : )<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|UH4lU7MEaa	it is better to try Japanese hair straightening.  <br>  i have very thick and damaged hair and it got much more manageable , soft and healthy after the straightening. but no matter what- make sure you are going to a professional who knows what they are doing! make sure to meet with other people that got it done with him/ her/ the salon. getting referrals for this will be your best bet.|`|UPfudUF5aa	Definitely the CHI!! i just got mine a week ago and it works wonders. I have thick and coarse hair and no other flat iron has made my hair so straight and silky.  My chi came with its Chi Silk Infusion, its a very concentrated heat protectant. Thats what helps your hair to be soft and sil along with the flat iron. ITS GREAT!!
