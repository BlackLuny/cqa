20090307102402AAite5o	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will Vitamin B12 help or hurt?	I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and read that B12 may be helpful. I took 500mcg yesterday around 5pm and felt very energized the rest of the day. In the evening, however, I felt a very vague but frightening feeling of being detached or in a dream-like state. I thought I had experienced depersonalization before, but that seemed more like it fit the description than what I had had before. Could B12 have caused that? I felt AWESOME after taking the B12, but then got hit with that odd feeling at night and this morning. I'm wondering if I was just getting panicked because I felt different, and the b12 is actually working.

I havent had sex in about 3.5 months, when my last relationship ended. The guy I was dating, had a vasectomy approx. 3-4years prior to me meeting him.(he is 37) We also used condoms, because you can never be to careful. Well, my question isnt really about sex, but about my period. I havent had a 'regular' period since the begining of Dec. 2006, a month after my relationship ended. The only sign of a period I have gotten the last two months was a light pink discharge for about four days each of those two months. I know Im not pregnant, because I tested just to be sure. Now, I know with the IUD, my periods can be slightly irregular, very light, or even stop all together, but, my OB/GYN, said that all that would happen within the 1st year. Is it possible that 2.5 years after having it inserted, my period could still be changing? I'm 22, and nothing about premarital sex plz.

Probably we will ask an Army Chaplin to marry us.  Our first time together should be romantic and special, but I can't get pregnant because I will be in the Army.  Both of us are virgins.  I want it to be as perfect as possible so no condoms to come between our love making or toxic chemicals in my vagina.         What I would like is an herbal contraceptive that I could use to prevent pregnancy.  I also don't want to take any pills.  We are both in great health, often run together in the park, and eat low fat, no red meat, etc.  I NEVER take pills, except an occasional  advil.  I rarely have any severe menstrual symptoms and when I do just have mild cramps or dissiness etc.  I just wait them out.  The same with him.  So is there something that will keep his sperm from being able to inpregnate me.

20090227141146AACktXT	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	My toes are looking a bit strange?	Sorry for the graphicness!   Being very overweight, I've been walking a LOT over the past three or four weeks, maybe even more, 8kms a day. And I've had the usual blissters and stuff. But one of my toes is suffering badly on each foot. They are the one beside the big toe and are longer than the big toe, meaning that they are very big parts of walking... A lot of pressure goes on them when I'm walking.        Anyway, they started to swell about a week after I started to walk. And then the nail started to darken and were tender so I thought I was probably loosing the nail. The nail never came off till last week whenI was cutting my nails and from under one there was a sudden gush of fluid from under that toenail. I checked the other toe on the oother foot and same thing happened. I realized the toenails were both loose and slowly cut down, finding that all of my nail was dead and loose, just stuck, and the skin under it was tender and upset. There was pus under the nail too.      The nail's been gone for about a week. But now the skin above where the nail on the toes ended is starting to go yellow, get pus, die and fall off... there's a couple of large deep gaps where the dead skin was cut away.       What is going on with my toes? Is my walking to blame for the dead nails and the dying of the skin? What can I do to fix it?      Sorry, I know it's graphic, but it concerns me.

My doc said I have a bladder infection and I have antibotics but I really don't want to keep having to get up to use the bathroom in class. Should I just stay home and rest over the long weekend? ugh I'm so confused. Oh yeah and I started the antibotics on Tuesday if that helps on determining when I'll start feeling better.

Okay, to make a very long story short, when I was 19, I went to the dentist, and he was feeling a cavity for the first time.  Only the novocaine was faulty and I felt every itty bitty little bit of that procedure.      I never went back to the dentist again out of fear.      Few years later I was diagnosed with MS and I'll be honest, for the next few years after that, I let things go to hell, including my teeth, I guess, but things had happen with my teeth that just didn't seem to make sense.  all 4 of my back teeth, top and bottom either cracked or they fell apart.      I'm 29 and my husband had always been guessing the medications I had been taking for my MS, including steriods, greatly affected my teeth.  Fine, whatever      But I am guessing cavities played a big part in this, and I guess these are my wisdom teeth, I do not know, lol.  Sorry, but now, 2 or 3 out of those 4 are generating a TON of pain for me right now, anytime I eat anything, or when I try to sleep at night.      and by now, I am just so unbelievably embarrassed to show up to a dentist office and have to explain to this person why my teeth are in the condition they are in.  Maybe it's my fault, maybe it's not... but I'm just too damn scared and embarrassed to go to the dentist.      I'm trying to find things to relieve the pain, but... :(

20080927003434AAZWN8Z	Health;Other - Health	Mild Migraine? I don't know!?	This is the second time this has happened to me.      All of a sudden, it starts to get more difficult for me to see things (It's not blurry, my range of vision narrows, making me feel like it's going to just go out. My vision is not "black.. just narrowed).   It's kind of like the feeling when you look at a lamp (directly at it) then look away. It has that feeling. Also, when I look at a book or magazine, I can't see the whole sentence at once. Some words are blurred out.   Another symptom is it becomes very difficult for me to see my left peripheral vision.   On top of that, a small headache begins to form at either the back or top of my head (around that region). This has only happened twice and lasts between 30 min. and 1 hour.       Could this be a mild migraine? This just started coming up about 2 weeks ago. Help!

20081002082820AAnyfoH	Health;Mental Health	How can i control my binge ?	my weight has been such a rollercoster for the past 2 years. when i first developed anorexia in 2006 i went from 150 to 80 in 5 months, then i snapped out of my anorexia phase and became a binge compulsive eater making my way back up to 160. this is where i was at until july of 2007, in july of 2007 i turned to bulimia to solve my problems, sense july i have gotten down to 130 and thats where im at now maintaining. my bulimia has definitely subsided. i usually throw up once or twice a week, instead of 4 times a day. and im hoping when i get to 120 it will stop all together. sense im at 130 i only have 10lbs to lose, so i can do it, and i want to do it the right way, im so sick of being upset with myself. im never happy, and im so self conscious. i feel like my binge eating habits are coming back though. which does make me sort of nervous. because its always been something i could control, or its like my mind leaves the building, and i eat and eat, so much, and then when im done, my mind returns and all i have to say is "what in the world did i just do?!"this usually happens in the morning. after noon is my safe time iv come to realize. when i wake up if im in a binge mood i will eat anywhere from 3-6 bowls of cereal, and 4 pieces of bread slabbed with butter and honey. gross huh? after that im fine. i get home from school and have a lean cuisine pizza (300 calories) and then for dinner i have a lean cuisine, usually the salmon one for 250 calrories. im a pescaterian so i dont eat meat, only fish. and i dont binge. i have rice cakes for 35 calories for a snack. and everything is fine, i just wish i could control my morning weirdness. maybe then id actualy lose weight.       if anyone has delt with this same thing before, do you have any tips on how i can control myself, and have one bowl of cereal, instead of a bajillion?

20070803113841AAfszul	Health;Women's Health	Is it perimenopause or....?	I am 34. Over the last several months I've experienced times (sometimes once or twice a day, other days it doesn't happen at all) where my body literally feels like it's on fire; radiating heat, especially in my upper body area. (face, chest, arms, hands) My husband and children notice the heat too, if they're too close to me, holding my hand, etc.        I don't get flushed or sweat, which seems almost odd given how hot I feel. Haven't (so far) noticed any rhyme or reason to when it starts or how to tell it's going to start either. All I know is after about 30 to 60 minutes, the "flash" ends and I'm back to my usual "cold" self.       My mother and grandmother both had "induced" menopause from hysterectomies, so I don't have a family history to compare my experiences to.      I'm still kind of young for this--though I know some women do have earlier onset than others. Could this be perimenopause, or something else? Any thoughts?

I did not pay it much attention at first, It looked like I had a small cut in the region.. it has not increased in size, but it has yet to go away. I don't want to go to student health because I don't want this to be in my medical records here if it proves to be a herpes outbreak. (might be a wart) Would it be ok that I go to a urgent care center, or should I look for a general doctor to go to? Not to be gross, but I have never had sex/oral sex.. just touching.. but I know you can get it from genital contact.. Thanks in advance for anyone's help!

20080314131151AAk5tI4	Health;Men's Health	Penis pain?	My penis is experiencing some pain when erect. It is not super painful, but it is still raising my concerns. I am currently going thru a divorce and I have not had sex or any sexual contact in months...probably 5 to 6 months. I did do some kegel exercise within the past month so I can be ready to go when this divorce is over. I read that a person should stop their urine and start to pee again, 5 times, everytime they use the bathroom. It's suppose to strenghten some muscle, or something. Anyways I am kind of concerned about this pain, could it be related to this kegel thing I did? It only hurts when erect.

It's more discomfort than pain, but it's always accompanied by a mild headache.      No pain-relief tablets really help, only lying in bed is easing the discomfort.       People have suggested that I could have a trapped nerve, does anybody know whether this is true or what else it could be?      Of course, I will see a doctor if this persists.      Thanks :)

I need glasses, and want them as soon as possible so I keep asking my parents to take me to the glasses place.   My mom is like "Even if you pick them out, it will take a couple weeks for you to get them." and my dad says that I can pick them up on the same day. My mom says that's only if you go to some special place like LensCrafters. Is this true? Where can I go to get my glasses as soon as possible instead of having to wait forever?

20090307105950AAhvM3B	Health;Mental Health	Do you think the numbers of people with post traumatic stress disorder has increased in Israel/Palestine?	Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that follows a terrifying event. Often, people with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal and feel emotionally numb, especially with people they were once close to. PTSD, once referred to as shell shock or battle fatigue, was first brought to public attention by war veterans, but it can result from any number of traumatic incidents. These include kidnapping, serious accidents such as car or train wrecks, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, violent attacks such as a mugging, rape, or torture, or being held captive. The event that triggers it may be something that threatened the person's life or the life of someone close to him or her. Or it could be something witnessed, such as mass destruction after a plane crash.      Whatever the source of the problem, some people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of nightmares and disturbing recollections during the day. They may also experience sleep problems, depression, feeling detached or numb, or being easily startled. They may lose interest in things they used to enjoy and have trouble feeling affectionate. They may feel irritable, more aggressive than before, or even violent. Seeing things that remind them of the incident may be very distressing, which could lead them to avoid certain places or situations that bring back those memories. Anniversaries of the event are often very difficult.      PTSD can occur at any age, including childhood. The disorder can be accompanied by depression, substance abuse, or anxiety. Symptoms may be mild or severe--people may become easily irritated or have violent outbursts. In severe cases they may have trouble working or socializing. In general, the symptoms seem to be worse if the event that triggered them was initiated by a person--such as a rape, as opposed to a flood.      Ordinary events can serve as reminders of the trauma and trigger flashbacks or intrusive images. A flashback may make the person lose touch with reality and reenact the event for a period of seconds or hours or, very rarely, days. A person having a flashback, which can come in the form of images, sounds, smells, or feelings, usually believes that the traumatic event is happening all over again.      Not every traumatized person gets full-blown PTSD, or experiences PTSD at all. PTSD is diagnosed only if the symptoms last more than a month. In those who do have PTSD, symptoms usually begin within 3 months of the trauma, and the course of the illness varies. Some people recover within 6 months, others have symptoms that last much longer. In some cases, the condition may be chronic. Occasionally, the illness doesn't show up until years after the traumatic event.

I mention this because I know sometimes heat can give people headaches, but the thing is I didn't even get hot.  I felt fine when I was outside but after I had been inside about 30 minutes my headache started.  As the day went on my headache just got worse and worse and around 9 pm I was really suffering.  This morning my head still hurts a bit but it's finally fading away.      I always drink plenty of water so it's not a headache from dehydration either.

20090307104001AAyNWD9	Health;Mental Health	Overcoming social anxiety?	For the past three years I've been fine, for the most part, with my social anxiety.  Though I'm not sure I've handled it right.  I would lock myself in my house and only leave when I had to.  But I was content and it didn't bother me.   I recently came out of a very brief relationship and it made me realize that I really do want to meet more people and be more social.  For the first time in my life I'm not contented sitting at home anymore.  But the idea of me going out places by myself and talking to people I don't know makes me nauseous and incredibly uncomfortable.   I have a small group of wonderful friends who have been very supportive and will come with me to some of these things.  But my friends have lives of their own and I can't depend on them to abandon their families and lives for me.  I have to learn to be comfortable in social settings alone.   Is there a way for me to get over the fear I have of being in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people?  How on earth will I ever meet people if I can't get past this?      I would prefer not to have to take meds for this if there is another way.

I will start shaking and freaking out. Sometimes I pass out. And, I go on like rampages of crazyness where everything has to be organized.

If anyone's ever experimented with dissociatives, the way I think on them is how I'm constantly starting to feel at all times and the only way to explain it is trapped.

It does not matter how many hours I have been awake or how tired I am. I will stay awake until 6am every night. When I do fall asleep, I sleep until about 1-2pm. Then it happens all over again. Sometimes I get my sleep "on track" for about a week then it happens again. I have taken OTC sleep aids, laid in bed for hours trying to force sleep, warm milk, heating pads, nothing helps.  My doctor prescribed me topamax for migraine relief and it is suppose to help with my sleeping as well, but it has the reverse effect and wires me. I took it at 10 pm one night and was up until 3 pm the next day!!      I don't do drugs, I haven't drank in 5 months. Even when I did drink it was socially. What is wrong with me?

It first started out with a soar throat. I had it for a week and let it go away on its own. Then a week later I had felt tired, had a headache, and i felt like I had a sinus infection. So I went to the doctor and she had told me that because I never treated my strep throat, it came back in a different way. So she gave me an antibiotic that I had to take for 10 days. While taking the medicine, I felt fine. Two days after my medication was done, I had a high fever, head and neck pain, loss of appetite, and I was very tired. That went on for three weeks. It started getting better and now I have swollen glands and a soar throat. What could i possibly have? I have been sick for too long!!!! HELP

My eye doctor just changed my contact lens to a lower strength in both eyes because he says my new contact lenses are now allowing more air to get to my eye. My eyes won't have to work as hard to see. I switched contacts lens from acuvue 2 to acuvue oasys. I guess the oasys is suppose to allow more oxygen to get into the eye.  I also ordered new glasses.  Well, my new glasses and my new contact lenses seem too weak.  Everything seems to be blurry and have a halo effect on it.  When I put on my old glasses, everything is really clear.  I have had my old glasses for 8 years.  Doctor claims that my eyes were being strained with my old prescription. It was too strong for me.  I don't agree.  I never had headaches or anything.

20090307112118AAyuL2B	Health;Women's Health	Is there a chance I could I be pregnant?	I've been having regular sex for the last 3 months but we have ALWAYS used a condom, and to my knowledge, it has never split.       I'm a week late on my period. I'm always due on the 1st of every month and I've never been late.    I'm wondering if there's a chance I could be pregnant, or whether I'm just late because February has only 28 days and this may have messed up my cycle.         I'm 17, and my boyfriend and I just split up.   On a side note, having sex at 17 isn't illegal as I live in Britain where the age of consent is 16.          Thank you for any answers and advice.

20090307111631AAunF77	Health;Dental	How can you get into Havard Dental School..?	Although I'm still a sophomore in High School at the moment but there are only 2 years left until I graduate.   I've been DREAMING to get into Havard since I was a little kid.   However, my biggest problem now is...How?   I know Biology, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry calculus/trig, English are all required to get in.   I'm taking Bilogy at the moment, next year, as a Junior, I'll be taking Advance Chemistry, and Allgebra2, and as a Senior, I'll be taking Trig.   What's I am confused about is that Havard said that it DOES NOT accept transfer students. What do they mean by that?   If they don't accept transfer students then how am I suppose to learn Calculus? I would have to go somewhere in Arizona, like ASU, to learn Calculus and then apply to go to Harvard.   Help me please?   If you are attending Havard Dental School right now, please tell me what I should do more in High School and after High School.   Thankyou for reading.
20090307111721AAFzgf4	Health;Women's Health	Bleeding after orgasm (not having sex) past depo user... help!!!!?	I'm so glad to have found this forum. I am 24 years old and have been trying to figure this problem out. I am generally healthy never had any issues and never took any form of birth control until August 08- Depo, I had spotting for the first few weeks then no period and I was THRILLED (although not having sex it was still nice to not worry) toward November when I was due for my 2nd depo shot I was bleeding again and figured it was "wearing off" and everything was normal- Then I had my period for 2 1/2 months! I decided not to get the shot again this time and my doc put me on progesterone pills for 10 days- stating everything would return to normal. I took the pills and the "period-like" bleeding stopped, but the last 3-4 months every time I have clitoral (no penetration- still not having sex) stimulation I bleed heavily for a few hours- clotted, fleshy deep red blood. I've been seeing a guy for several months and he must think I'm such a prude because I wont let his hand come anywhere near my vagina because I'd be mortified if I started bleeding all over... this is awful! HELP!!!!!!! I've also never had an abnormal pap or issues with yeast ect, but since the bleeding stopped I've had white discharge with a musky smell to it and I don't know what to do- I feel so far from sexy its unbelievable- did I ruin my body with 2 stupid depo shots I didn't even really need? This is terrible!
