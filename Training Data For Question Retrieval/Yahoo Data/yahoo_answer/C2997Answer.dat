15a7306c73f64b6c1aa697e80880e2b4aa	Estimado amigo, difiero en la opinin de la mayora de los anteriores expositores.    El agua mas saludable para tomar no es la purificada que venden ordinariamente ya que esta es purificada a travs del sistema de smosis, mediante el cual adems de las impurezas son removidos muchos de los minerales que el cuerpo necesita.  Al contrario, el agua purificada por estos mtodos en su recorrido a travs del organismo va recogiendo los minerales adquiridos por otras vas y desechndolos a travs de la orina.    En un principio, cuando el agua por sistemas smosis se hizo  tan popular, notbamos que podamos ingerir grandes cantidades y aun permaneca la sensacin de sed, se deba a que los minerales que necesitbamos no estaban presentes y ya, pues por costumbre ni lo percibimos.    Contrario a eso, el agua mineral es tomada de manantiales y estn presente parte de los minerales que el organismo necesita.    Cual agua es mejor? Esa es tu eleccin.|`|9a7538729c8065fcca4ec1a6d0f4871baa	yo te diria que la mineral, esa no esta tan desinfectada y eso como la purificada, pero tu hablas de saludable, asi que tiene mas sales y minerales disueltos que podrian ser sanos, el agua purificada tambien es muy buena, solo a esa si le quitaron las sales y los minerales, pero esta limpiecita, y el agua destilada, esa hace da?o, te hace que te infles.|`|4a618b6a2e6504c7504eeed88cd8e047aa	purificada, pero que sea de alguna empresa reconocida del area que te encuentres.|`|AA12199889	purificado|`|037a6db38958224b4ddb67ef98a2ec9eaa	Nunca tomes agua destilada, aunque es la mas pura, no es la mas saludable, te puede deshidratar.  Si ingieres normalmete agua mineral, comenzaras a acumular en tu s ri?ones trazas de carbonatos, que te ocasionaran problemas posteriormente, es bueno tomarla de vez en cuando.  El agua purificada se ha sometido a un proceso que garantiza que esta libre de microorganismos, y que contiene una cantidad de minerales aceptable para el organismo, y que ademas no contiene contaminantes. Los fabricantes de agua purificada deben de seguir una serie de normas para poder vender su producto.   Lo mejor es el agua purificada y ocasionalmente agua mineral.|`|0d8f0b7f1323aa2c27ddbda7d46f4c48aa	Purificada.....

SuZbBnycaa	Use a thermostat to turn heat on only when you're home.  Regularly replace your filter.   Closing Drapes and shades lowers costs.    Unplug electronics when they are not in use. (Even when turned off, CD players in the U.S. consume enough energy in one year to power the Las Vegas Strip for six months.)  Insulate your hot water pipe from the water heater to the wall  Vacuum the refrigerator dirty coils on the back or bottom front of your refrigerator so motor doesn't work harder than necessary.    Electronics products are responsible for approximately 15 percent of household electricity use. Devices still use energy when theyre switched off to power features such as clock displays and remote controls  in fact, the average U.S. household spends $100 each year to power devices while they are in standby mode.   LED bulbs are exceptionally energy-efficient, and use up to 90% less energy than regular incandescent bulbs to produce the same amount of light.  Replace lights and lamps with energy-efficient compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs, which last up to 10 times longer and use up to 75% less electricity.|`|aWTo9K22aa	Turn it off, always.

The hotter your room is, the faster it leaks heat. This heat has to be replaced by the heater.     If you let your room cool whilst you're not there then the room will lose heat less quickly and the heater won't have to work hard to replace it.|`|gIlhHDyKaa	Try to keep your heater at about 18-20C and turn it off when you're out. Also, insulate your house and seal air leaks to reduce heat loss. Switching off any unused appliances (spare computers, Hi Fi's etc) at the wall will save you at least 10% off your electricity bill. Energy-saving light bulbs (CFLs) are a little more expensive than standard bulbs, but will last up to 10 times longer with a 50% better efficiency rate.|`|4owUg43oaa	Definitely turn off your heater when you aren't there, but keep in mind you may need minimum heat to keep pipes from freezing if you have a basement or crawl space.  Other great ways to save on electricity are turning off lights when you aren't in the room, switching to compact florescent light bulbs, turn down you water heater a few degrees, turn up your refrigerator a few degrees, use the 'air dry' setting on your dishwasher, wash all your clothing in cold water only, and use the sun when possible to dry your clothes and light your home. ( Open up those curtains!)  Good luck on lowering your electric bill and saving the earth!

Photosynthetic and Growth Responses of Field-grown Potato to Elevated CO2   --------------------------------------...  Reference  Sicher, R.C. and Bunce, J.A. 1999. Photosynthetic enhancement and conductance to water vapor of field-grown Solanum tuberosum (L.) in response to CO2 enrichment. Photosynthesis Research 62: 155-163.   What was done   Potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants were grown in open-top chambers for three sequential growing seasons at atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 350, 530, and 700 ppm to determine the effects of elevated CO2 on photosynthesis and growth in this important agricultural crop species.    What was learned   Averaged over the three-year investigation, elevated CO2 increased net photosynthetic rates by 28 and 49% in plants grown at 530 and 700 ppm, in spite of the fact that the plants experienced photosynthetic acclimation, as indicated by 13 and 21% reductions in total rubisco activity. However, atmospheric CO2 enrichment did not significantly affect leaf chlorophyll a and b contents, total soluble leaf protein content, leaf rubisco content, or initial rubisco activity. The additional carbohydrates produced by plants grown in CO2-enriched environments were utilized to increase tuber number and dry weight, which rose by 14 and 9%, respectively, for plants grown at 530 ppm and by 44 and 40% for plants grown at 700 ppm.    What it means   As the CO2 content of the air continues to rise, it is likely that potato plants will exhibit enhanced rates of photosynthesis, thereby leading to increased tuber yield in the form of greater tuber numbers and dry weights. Thus, one can expect greater yields from this important agronomic crop as the atmospheric CO2 concentration increases.    OR     CO2 Enrichment  Not only is it important to prevent CO2 depletion, but also beneficial to enrich to levels much greater than atmospheric levels. Higher than ambient CO2 levels are known to boost plant growth by over 40%. The level of enrichment and the timing of enrichment are crucial, since all consistent and reliable methods of CO2 enrichment have a cost involved. Obviously since plants only require, take up, and use CO2 when photosynthesizing in light, enrichment only needs to occur when the lights are on or during daylight hours. Enrichment at night is pointless since the extra CO2 will not be taken up by the plants and will just accumulate. Emphasis needs to be placed on regulating levels during photosynthetic periods. Secondly, enrichment levels need to be high enough to replace the CO2 used by the plants and to increase the levels of CO2 in the environment to a level where it will accelerate photosynthesis and therefore plant growth. Levels of 800-1600 ppm have proven to be optimal for plants grown using enclosed cultivation. CO2 regulation and monitoring equipment then becomes important to make sure this level is reached and maintained consistently. A fluctuating CO2 level will not allow the plant to acclimate itself to the given environment, in turn, not allowing the plant to use the higher levels of CO2 available to it. In other words, it will acclimate to the lowest common denominator. CO2 enrichment will have its greatest effect on accelerating photosynthesis and growth when all other factors are also optimal - when there is sufficient light for photosynthetic reactions (45-50 watt per square foot), nutrient for plant implementation, and temperatures and humidity are in desired range. In short, get your environment right before implementing CO2 in your growroom. Temperatures can be run a little higher where CO2 is enriched and light levels are at optimum levels - generally in the range of 80 F (27 C) to 92 F (32 C) day temperatures for most fruiting and flowering plants.

En ocasiones, los prisioneros pueden acabar ayudando a los captores a alcanzar sus fines o evadir a la polica.    Debe su nombre a un hecho curioso sucedido en la ciudad de Estocolmo, Suecia. En 1973 se produjo un robo en el banco Kreditbanken de la mencionada ciudad sueca. Los delincuentes debieron mantener como rehenes a los ocupantes de la institucin durante 6 das. Al entregarse los captores, las cmaras periodsticas captaron el momento en que una de las vctimas besaba a uno de los captores. Y, adems, los secuestrados defendieron a los delincuentes y se negaron a colaborar en el proceso legal posterior.

Esto se da porque los dos quieren salir bien parados de la situacion y en consecuencia colaboran con el mismo fin, por supuesto, la persona secuestrada lo hace incocientemente movida por el institno de supervivencia al estar completamente indefenso, pero termina comprometiendose realmente con la causa del secuestrador e incluso despues haber recuperado la libertad mantienen aun las muestras de agradecimiento y afecto.   El sindrome de Estocolmo puede presentarse cuando los captores no tratan mal a sus victimas, y una de las cosas mas notables, es que hubo casos de gente que al ser liberadas no tomaron conciencia del da?o sufrido    Segun lo que lei..muchos especialistas decian de que cualquiera puede padecer de este sindrome     Cualquiera sea la causa del Sndrome de Estocolmo, las consecuencias son muy similares. Muchas personas empiezan a padecer pnico o agorafobia, por miedo a que el episodio se repita, explica la Licenciada Dohmen. Pesadillas, flashbacks, insomnio y reclusin tambin son comunes a quienes han vivido la experiencia de mantener un vnculo estrecho con sus victimarios. Algunos secuestrados necesitan asistencia, pero otros no quieren hacer un tratamiento, y finalmente se recuperan explica Dohmen. En cambio, para Bo de Besozzi la persona se adapt a cosas que violentan la autoestima y provocan humillacin, vergenza. Por lo que estos hechos no pueden ser narrados a nadie, excepto al terapeuta, por la valoracin social negativa que implican. En todos los casos, el tratamiento parece ser el mejor camino para evitar que los efectos postraumticos se prolonguen en el tiempo y el patrn del vnculo se repita en situaciones futuras.     El concepto de Sndrome de Estocolmo se usa tambin para describir la situacin de una mujer vctima de la violencia familiar (Sndrome de Estocolmo Domstico, SIES-d); o para referirse a las sociedades que son vctimas  pero cmplices- de gobiernos autoritarios.

Nt1IQGkfaa	One thing NOT to do is feed them to rabbits.  Contrary to popular belief, they can't eat celery because the strings catch in their throats and choke them.    I wouldn't recommend leaving them out for animals, but if you can get the manager of your store to invest in some kind of composter, it wouldn't go to waste.  Below are some great composting websites.    I have an 'Earth Machine' at home, and I find it quite effective, but it may not be good enough to handle the amounts of waste your store produces.  Maybe invest in a more industrial model?    You could also make it into a stock and sell, or donate to the homeless?|`|eMDnLUpqaa	First I would see if you can find a homeless shelter that has mouths to feed or look for a harvesters or such that can distribute to needy families. They dont get much in the line of fresh veggies so this is like a treat sometimes.You can check with your local animal rescue mission. If they take in animals such as rabbits, hamsters, etc... you can donate to them. Also farms and such I am sure would love to compost these items. Call around and see what you can find.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	It depends on where you live, rabbits and pigs would love those veggies. You may also want to check for a local community garden or some other organization who composts. At minimum you should be able to put it in your cities green waste.|`|bC0KRacHaa	Bunnies?  Turtles?

You could also find a church or community organization ( Salvation Army or Meals On Wheels spring to mind) and donate to them directly.

Good luck finding a great way to use this valuable resource!|`|fEB9IWWGaa	Contact your local food bank and see if the produce can be donated.  The food bank will usually come by the store on a regular basis to pick up the food items.|`|wDo1T3IAaa	Hi there great question. I have bunnies and they eat all of what you say. Please phone me 250 443 3215 and I will make arrangements with you. They would love it as I am getting apples, lettuce etc as extras for them besides their food. This is awesome. I also know a gentlemen that could use this kind of food for his chickens if you have more than I need.Rabbit droppings is also the best for your garden and plants as where horse/cow manure is not totally digested.A rabbits is clean high in nitrates.

Caroline|`|2N0QJ3kfaa	Some years ago in a big city, I "gleaned" from a grocery store. I sorted the produce for condition -- better stuff went to the AIDS pantry, the mid-level stuff went to families that came to my community center and friends helped distribute it to families in need (teachers and churches often know of families who need a little help), and the really damaged and/or unsalvageable went to friends who had goats & chickens (chickens are real omnivores). Feeding it to critters results in both nutrients for the animals and manure, which is, in many ways, better than compost in the garden.     The produce manager was my original contact, but as others learned what I was doing, the dairy manager and other department managers began to occasionally leave stuff for me instead of trashing it, which was great. Milk, cheese, eggs, meat, cookies, crackers, and even frozen dinners came our way, and pets and critters benefited.     I'm surprised to hear you're throwing food away -- most stores I've asked in recent years tell me it's against their policy, it's a liability, they've already got it sold to a pig farmer, or some other excuse why they won't give or even sell (at a reduced price) past-it's-prime produce.     It's sad, 'cause now that we have a farm, we also have critters who love these treats when we can get them -- our goats and poultry (and squirrels, 'coons, and assorted wild birds) enjoy old produce and baked goods, and even our dog and cats are delighted to get the occasional day-old donut, old egg, or moldy cheese, and with their short digestive tracts, it does them no harm.|`|AmMf2Vfxaa	If you are in the Traverse City area, contact the Fresh Food Partnership.

Yes, we have dumped some bad stuff into your atmosphere, and we need to clean up our act, but it is not causing the so called "global warming".  In fact, there really is no such thing.    It has been a well known fact that weather patterns fluctuate and change course on a fairly regular bases.    It has been reported that over the last 20 years, earths temperature has raise almost a whole degree, and this is causing the Artic snow caps to melt (despite the fact we are talking subzero degrees !!!).  The temperature would have to raise over 50 degrees to start any type of melting.    On a recent news report I heard them say that the Alps recorded the coldest ever temperatures in 2008.  So far this winter, many places have received record snow falls, and record low temperatures.      There is coming a future global warming, but it won't be our doing...    2Peter 3:10  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.     Now that global warming is what people should be talking about.|`|dZFwQPsGaa	I'm not sure about sea levels, but, to me, glaciers disappearing, the Antarctica ice shelves breaking apart, the measured rise in both temperature and CO2, and the increases frequency and power of both tornadoes and hurricanes point to our damaging the global weather system.  As a scientist who has studied statistics, I see anomalies all over the place. The simplest explanation is that we have caused it (Occum's Razor).  It being caused by a natural cycle--maybe, but the evidence supports that we've done it.       Some people think it is silly to think that we humans could cause an effect on the planet.  Two things I have to say about that:         1.  God put us in charge, and        2.   Hiroshima and Nagasaki    EDIT: as with anything, we have to have a balance.  Too little CO2 and we'd have some severe cooling.  Too much, we have severe warming.  We are disrupting the balance--burning fossil fuels puts CO2 directly into the atmosphere.|`|q6phm94caa	You're loosing the plot Monica.

Aside from the fact that every time you exhale you put out some CO2,  CO2 is formed by the combustion of carbon, which most things are made of, specifically in fuels used by the utilities companies.  Most of them still use coal, while some are powered by water and wind turbines.  There is a fairly direct relationship between the amount of carbon burned and the amount of CO2 produced by any one plant, car and so on.  I guess from what you say they are called carbon emissions, but as far as the data I've looked at it's considered in pounds or tons emitted versus how much was burned to begin with.    Hope that helps you out some, but I've never really heard it be called that way.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Nata sounds correct but the amount in tons sees way low.  I have never heard the term carbon emissions used in the way you describe.  It may have been a typo or something.   As someone mentioned, every time you exhale, that is an emission.  Every time your car runs or a grasshopper breaths, it is an emission of CO2.    from the link  "Now let me take you back to the1950s when this was going on.  Our cities were entrapped in a pall of pollution from the crude internal combustion engines that powered cars and trucks back then and from the uncontrolled emissions from power plants and factories. "    emissions in that case means that there is more than one kind of gas being emitted.

There is climate change, there's plenty of evidence for it in all sorts of places, and the crucial thing is that it can only be explained if you model all the natural factors *and* human influences as well.    Here is just a small sample of the evidence -    Eleven of the last twelve years (19952006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850).    New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record.    The average atmospheric water vapour content has increased since at least the 1980s over land and ocean as well as in the upper troposphere. The increase is broadly consistent with the extra water vapour that warmer air can hold.    Observations since 1961 show that the average temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at least 3000m and that the ocean has been absorbing more than 80% of the heat added to the climate system.  Such warming causes seawater to expand, contributing to sea level rise.    Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on average in both hemispheres. Widespread decreases in glaciers and ice caps have contributed to sea level rise.    Losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003.  Flow speed has increased for some Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice from the interior of the ice sheets.    Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1mm per year.    At continental, regional and ocean basin scales, numerous long-term changes in climate have been observed. These include changes in arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones.    Average arctic temperatures increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years.    Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7% per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4% per decade.    Temperatures at the top of the permafrost layer have generally increased since the 1980s in the Arctic (by up to 3C).    Long-term trends from 1900 to 2005 have been observed in precipitation amount over many large regions.  Significantly increased precipitation has been observed in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe and northern and central Asia. Drying has been observed in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia.    Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by freshening of mid- and high latitude waters together with increased salinity in low latitude waters.    Mid-latitude westerly winds have strengthened in both hemispheres since the 1960s.    More intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas since the 1970s, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.    The frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most land areas, consistent with warming and observed increases of atmospheric water vapour.    Widespread changes in extreme temperatures have been observed over the last 50 years. Cold days, cold nights and frost have become less frequent, while hot days, hot nights and heat waves have become more frequent.    There is observational evidence for an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, correlated with increases of tropical sea surface temperatures.    So there is plenty of evidence of climate change of various sorts, and warming in general.    Carbon dioxide is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm3 in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores.    Increased carbon dioxide means increased retention of heat from solar radiation - this is simple physics.    Also the pH of the oceans is changing, very likely as a result of all the additional man-made CO2 it's absorbing.    IPCC, 2007: Summary for Policymakers.
