20090222224916AAET3WH	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Girls only. If you found a guy and he was 3 inches tall, what would you do?	Would you have him paint your toes?   Would you step on him?   Kidnap him?   Would you enslave him?   Have him kiss your feet?   Have him rub your feet?   Sit on him?   Tattoo him and (where)?   Make him smell something bad?   Stuff him in your dirty sock?   Have him do Other stuff? (anything you can think of.) funny is good too.      But if you have a better answer then go for it. I'm writing a story and need some ideas and basic plots.   I am actually thinking of having 3 different girls come into the story at different time. One is a good friend, one really mean and cruel and one who falls in love with him.   Thanks for your help.

20090223020021AA2xM7z	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Why would they add a fungicide to the wax coating on fruit?	I am not sure wht wax is added to fruit...How can you remove the wax coating before eating?        http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6732e/x67...    A fungicide treatment usually follows and the application method used may be as an aqueous spray, a drip or by a control droplet application (CDA). The fungicide may also be applied together with the protective wax coating. The choice of fungicides is dependent on regulatory approval and is different for each country. In the U.S., Thiabendazole (TBZ) and Imazalil are approved fungicides for post-harvest application. Orthophenylphenol (SOPP) and carbonates are approved as fruit sanitizers. Immediately after fungicide treatment, a water based wax emulsion is applied to protect fruit from water loss and improve appearance. The application methods are basically similar to a fungicide treatment

Where I live, there is a farm that produces vegetables which are grown in the traditional way, just like it was 100 years ago. The land is tilled and ploughed using oxen and mules are used with the harvesting.    As vegans want no food that is produced by animals, what are the opinions of people on this forum to this kind of farming. Would you consider that animal abuse, though the animals all look in a healthy condition. There still has to be pest control because of locusts. They can strip a field of it's crop in a day. Also, using animals to do the work there is natural manure instead of fertiliser.   Oxen are majestic beasts. It is rare to see them these days.
