20090203104740AAYJfRL	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat so weird? Is she mental or something?	My cat, Kitty, has her abnormalities. See how much you could help me with the following:      1: Kitty is scared of everybody but me.       2: She overreacts over the smallest things. EX: She is scared of the iron (when my mom is using it), the vacuum cleaner, my sister told me she might be scared of the radio, and she is even scared of my hamster, Snowball!      3: This was already in one of my other questions, but she scratches the shelf in front of her food bowl prior to eating and the floor after eating.
20090203104919AANpVhM	Pets;Cats	What is the best way to introduce a cat to a new house?	We are moving this weekend, but I still don't know what to do to reduce stress for my cat. She's an adult, so change is going to be difficult for her. On top of that, she just went through a traumatic experience because we were robbed and she was the one who witnessed the whole thing... Thanks for your advice!!
20090203105610AAq2iyJ	Pets;Horses	What kind of horse is she (PICS)?	This is my aunts mare she adopted about a year ago. Shes 7 years old and is mainly used for trail riding, although she still needs some training (people before my aunt hardly ever rode her). She stands about 14.2hh and has had 1 foal. Shes extremely stubborn if that helps, lol (that might be from the lack of training). We cant figure out what breed she is. Any suggestions would help...    http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...    http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...    http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...    http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...    http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...

20090203113201AAQ1mPB	Pets;Birds	Which way is the best option for a new Sun Conure?	I have a 5-year-old Sun Conure that I got when she was older.  We want to get another one, but we want to get a baby.  We cannot decide if it would be better to hand-feed the baby ourselves or just pay the extra money and let the breeder do it.  We have heard that the babies have a better bond if we were to feed it ourselves, and we have also heard this is not true.  We just want what is best for the bird.  What are your opinions?
20090203122130AAhOezS	Pets;Cats	Would it be better to give up one cat or both of them?  details?	Ok a few months ago we had to banish our cats to the basement.  One of them was peeing all over my wife's things (comforter, floor by her side of the bed ETC)  We think it is because of the new baby and they never really got use to or liked our 2 year old.  Well we were going to give them up but couldn't because we have had them for 6 years.    Well one of them has taken to getting in the sub celling and staying there.  He comes out to eat and but if you even move to go down stairs he finds away to get up there. We can't block it off tried not working.  Meanwhile the other cat comes up stairs all day (just not allowed in bed room any more).  He even lets the 2 year old pet him now.  He is very loving (even more than before) he just sleeps and eats in the basement.   My wife has not actually seen the other cat in months i have seen his but has he climbs up in to the ceiling.   My wife says we should just give him to the humane society and hopefully he will find a good home.  He has no real quality of life just living in the ceiling all day and night.    I think that since they have been together since 6 weeks old they will miss each other. Although Kenndy spends all day with us now is only down there at night.

Well, I was talking with my cousin about how I can barely keep up with my pup (we live in an apartment) and she suggested training her to run on the treadmill. Apparently she trained her dog when he was a puppy to run on the treadmill to get out all the built up energy since puppies seem to be able to go 12 hours straight without getting tired!

20090203122450AANHyPr	Pets;Fish	Freshwater Aquarium Needs Unique Animals?	I have kept fish all my life, and am very skilled in aquarium maintenence and upkeep.  Ok, the reason I said that was not to boast at all, but to ask for what unique freshwater animals I can put in my new 10gallon tank.  I have already set it up, and gotten the water treated and running for 5 days, and I am now ready to populate the tank.      Again, I said what I said so that you would not hold back with your suggestions.  I am not a soccer mom who got this for her kid and is going to kill all the fish because she doesnt know what she is doing.      I know what I am doing and want to break of of the norm and not just do fish only.  Right now the tank has water in it, two live plans, pepple rocks, and a filter - that's it.  So what do you suggest...or should I go saltwater and get some REALLY cool stuff? (I have never had a saltware tank before though)

20090222195737AALyufr	Pets;Other - Pets	Cat, Dog and Vegetables?	Our cat started chewing on our indoor house plants. She's 2.5 years 15 pound 2 ft  long (nose to butt) cat.      So I started slicing up lettuce portions into her food. About half a leaf of lettuce daily. If she doesn't get her lettuce or I forgot, she would twirl around my feet to harass me. Sometimes she gets impatient that she smelled the lettuce I am cutting up for her, and she puts her front paws on the table to observe me slicing the lettuce. She eats up the lettuce in no time. She would not eat more than half a leaf a day.      We lived on a farm for a few months and our dog (pointer mutt) then learned from the horses and started chewing and eating grass. But he does not have the teeth to chew up the grass and he would regurgitate it. To prevent him from desiring for grass I too give him half a leaf of lettuce daily. He does not like eating carrots but he loves carrot soup mixed into his dog food. But so far, I have not given him carrot soup because I am not sure if carrot soup is good for him, but he never had any bowel problem after having carrot soup.      Should I continue feeding our dog carrot soup?      Does your dog or your cat like lettuce?   Do most cats or dogs like lettuce?   What do you think of the dietary behaviour of my cat and dog? Abnormal?

20090222195727AAnUrKI	Pets;Fish	Can you believe this?	so i went to walmart today and i usually walk by the fishies just to look at them (i don't buy my fish there anymore, learned my lesson!!) and after i looked around the tanks i noticed 12 dead fish floating around!!!! there where those white weekend feeders and the algae had taken over in some of the tanks, too. oh yeah, most of the dead fish were covered in white fuzzy fungus, almost to the point where you couldn't see the fish anymore. so it was pretty obvious that the tanks have been abandoned for more then just the weekend (today is sunday).      i am pretty outraged because of this. i think its a shame that they do not take care of the living creatures they sell! i mean don't have fish tanks in you mega store if you cant manage them! and this is not the first time that i've seen them handle their fish cruelly. they've put two kinds of fish together that basically tore each other to pieces. that time i left a note on the tank... next time i went by (days later) it was fixed (maybe the stronger fish ate all the others, who knows...)      so do you think there is something that could be done about this. should i write an email to corporate? will that even make a difference?

We met her before, but went to the "foster home" today to see how she acts in her own area. The humane society is run/maintained by volunteers & they like to keep animals at peoples' homes to keep them well socialized.       Anyway, we pulled up this driveway....       And about 8 dogs ran to my car, started barking & growling, and even tried jumping on my car. One of these dogs with this gigantic chow-mastiff mix who was HUGE and intimidating.  We went inside to this tiny cabin (approx. 700 sq ft). And this lady told us she's an RN at the hospital & lives there (unmarried, no kids). The kitchen was gross and literally STACKED with trash, moldy old food, dirty dishes, empty soda cans, etc. I have NEVER seen anything so mortifying in my life... until I moved to the living room where there were about 5 cats & 8 more dogs (all in all, about 20 dogs & 5 cats), pee, FUR EVERYWHERE, trash, etc. I mean... this woman must NEVER clean. I felt so bad for all these animals. Then she told us that she doesn't have time to train them.       We took this particular dog for a walk & she's awesome. We really want her. But should I report this place? Should I wait till Thursday when we get *our* dog & then report her?  I just don't know. I mean, it looked like something from Animal Cops on Animal Planet...

20090222202736AAmABly	Pets;Other - Pets	So my bunny stopped peeing on the couch but he's still pooping on it like crazy?	He's litterbox trained and basically was since day 1, and he rarely even leaves a tiny poop pellet anywhere but the litterbox.  He is about 4 months old now. Since I got the little guy he has had a problem with peeing on the couch though.  After peeing on it 3 times, I decided that was enough and refused to let him hang out on the couch anymore.  Well last week I walked out of the room and was so mad to see him on the couch where hes not allowed.  I was searching for where he peed.  But there was no pee :)  i'm not sure if the couch ban taught him a lesson or what.  But now he has a new issue.  Instead of peeing, he poops on the couch.  Since the pellets are not messy and super easy to pick up and throw away I sort of looked the other way.  Now he's not just dropping 2 or 3 pellets, hes unloading a whole round (like 20 at a time!)  I can't look the other way anymore.  I'm happy hes done with the peeing, but how do I teach him not to poop on the couch?!

20090222201650AAtLozc	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my neighbor to stop her dog from barking?	HELP!  My neighbor's dog is seriously disturbing my health and sanity!       I am a single mother and due to the economy crash, I lost my job of several years and had to get a new job that happens to be at night. I have only a very limited time frame during the day when I can sleep and during those hours I simply MUST sleep. My neighbor lets her dog bark and bark and bark on and off again throughout the day. I use earplugs and even started taking sleeping pills to help me sleep through the barking but nothing works. It seems I will be finally in a good deep sleep and the dog will start again and I wake and can't fall back to sleep. It's so bad I am so tired at work I can't do my job well and I am afraid I will fall asleep and kill myself or someone else on the drive home.       My neighbor says she can't do anything about it because "dog's just naturally bark". This dog barks at anything and even at nothing! I asked her to muzzle it for the few minutes it needs to go outside and go to the bathroom and then remove the muzzle when she brings the dog back in but she refuses.       I am a dog lover - I have a dog of my own but I do not allow my dog to disturb others. I have become so desperate I am afraid I will wake one day and hurt the dog in a fit of rage from lack of sleep. The police say they can't do anything since it's during the day but that is so unfair since the job market isn't exactly open right now and I shouldn't have to change jobs because of my neighbor's cruelty.       Any suggestions?

20090222211217AAtoEeN	Pets;Cats	What do cats usually act like when you first bring it home to your house?	Do they usually sit on your lap and want you to pet them? And sleep on you? Or do they mostly want to stay away from you and be scared?      What does it mean if it comes out of the carry box and wants you to pet it and let it sit on you like immediately, is that a normal cat thing or does this mean it has a problem or what. Or just that it likes you already.
20090222205640AAGtf4p	Pets;Dogs	Pick of litter advice?	I read that when you pick a puppy from a litter you get the puppy that comes to you first. On the other hand I also read this kind of puppy will have dominance issues later in life because they were the dominate puppy from the litter. My question is (from anyone with knowledge on this) when picking out a puppy that will come home to a family with a small child, is it better to get the dominate puppy or the most submissive puppy from a litter?

20090222211004AA2e10g	Pets;Other - Pets	Why is there such a difference between loving a pet and eating meat?	Some people treat their pets with equal or more reverence than humans. For e.g. they have doggie spas, clothes, while people are starving in Africa. They tend to protest at animal cruelty      Then the same people have no qualms about eating any form of meat, fishes being clubbed, cows being slaughtered etc. While insects can be squashed, sprayed without any remorse      Whats with the double standard?

20090222204731AA04xeL	Pets;Horses	Horse Ownership (WA State + Parents)?	Hi!   I am a minor, so I can't freely buy my own horse. And, unfortunately, my parents aren't keen on the idea of owning a horse.       "Too much money!" or "They stinky, stupid, money sucking animals!" or "We would need a trailer, and we'd have to board! Who would get you to the stable?" And my personal favorite: "We'd get the dang horse and you would switch to wanting a boyfriend!"      While their points are valid (except stinky/stupid) how should I go about convincing them that purchasing a horse would be a very good thing for me? I have been riding since I was little, about 8-9 years now. So, obviously staying with horses isn't a problem.       Besides convincing them, if anyone owns a horse or owned, how much did it cost you annually? With or without board, we might move to the country soon. I live in Washington State, and if you board/live there and have/had a horse, what did it cost you?      *I am a Hunter/Jumper, and I have already found a few horses in WA and Oregon that fit what I need. My trainer is trying to convince my mom (who rather have me lease, which I am fine with) so she can convince  my dad (Mr. No-New-Animals)      Thank you!   Erin

If I pull my arm away, she rolls her ears back and gets an offended look on her face. Does she dislike me? Whats the deal with this wacky behavior?

20081110095820AAqZ0SO	Pets;Dogs	New Shih Tzu Puppy!! Need of some advice/info...?	Hey everyone, Recently I got a Shih Tzu puppy and since is smaller than my other dog I am a little questionable about a few things.    Lil info on my lil guy:   -He is 9 weeks   -Currently using wee wee pads   -Eating Eukanuba Small breed   -Crate Training (attempting)      Since day one I have introduced him to the crate. He loves it, he has not yet had any accidents in it. He uses his wee wee pad often not always but I dont expect perfection (not yet anyway). Yesterday was his first time outside walking. I took him on my deck. When he came back inside he did not seem the same, he almost seemed traumatized. I found that to be soo weird. As the night went along he began to play and come back around. Another thing is his poop for the past two days it has been inconsistent sometimes soft sometimes not. I am just looking to those shih tzu owners and/or breeders to give a little advice on what I mentioned as well as other things that may come to mind..THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!!

20070826005733AA9NJ1Y	Pets;Dogs	CAN You GUESS THE BREED?? TRY AND GUESS THE BREED!!!!!!!!?	It is a muscular, yet graceful dog of mastiff stock with very strong  jaws, and a short, sleek, glossy, thick, and always white coat. The head is convex in the front, with a moderate stop. The skull is massive and the jaws are strong and tenacious. The muzzle should be about the same length as the skull. The teeth should meet in a scissors bite. The ears are customarily cropped. Considerd the strongest of all dogs. An excellent guardian of the home. Loyal to the family, playful and intelligent. It is good with children and loves to kiss and cuddle with those the family accepts. This is a highly intelligent, powerful dog who needs a firm and consistent, but loving hand. Adult Dogs can be aggressive with other dogs however, he does not usually provoke the confrontation. All dogs are individuals and some are more dominant or possess a stronger prey drive than others. Can you guess the breed? GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!

I have two new puppies, one not as new--a five month old Boxer Lab mix I have had for about 3 months, and a brand new seven week old husky. I have let the two interact just once or twice today under strong supervision, and noticed how aggressively the older and bigger one plays--it's too much for the new guy and I am afraid he could get hurt. So I have the little one crated and am hoping the older one will just learn to be gentle. Is that possible?

He never really hurts him, but he does threaten to and kick at him and stuff. My dog is terrified. I have had him since I was in Kinder garden, and I love him very very much. I need to find a suitable home, like we used to have. He is such a sweet dog. He does get into holes and loves to search around and hunt. He is white and can get very messy. Oh, his name is Buster. He is small and doesn't way too much. He never really hurts anyone. But he doesn't like to have his feet or legs touched. He loves to cuddle with everyone and be petted. He sheds a bunch. He isn't trained very much, he has ran away a couple times but only if someone leave the door open. We gate him in our yard. We usually don't give him toys because he messes them up but he does love them. He likes dog food... But he does prefer people food. So we feed him some of our dinner sometimes and my younger siblings always feed him there breakfast. Once a month I make him an omelet, just egg and cheese though. Oh and he is about 9 years old. I can't really think of anything else. Does anyone think they could take him from me? Or think he is suitable for a new home? I love him very much and I really need him to have a great new home. Thanks so much! -Sarah
