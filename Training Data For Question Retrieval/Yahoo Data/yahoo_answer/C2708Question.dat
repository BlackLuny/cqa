20090304154543AA4Ddnp	Pets;Dogs	A bulldog and a German Shepherd?	Me and my bf love dogs and have wanted one for ages and decided to get one each because we didn't want them to be lonely :)      We have decided to get a British bulldog and a German Shepherd but wondered if they are a good combination and will get along?      Should we get them at the same time or get one first?  We would also love a cat :)       My aunty is having a baby in 8 weeks so.. would we have to keep them locked out of the lounge if we were looking after him, how would we know if we could trust the dogs because I have heard they can be aggressive breeds??      Thanks for any advice :)
20090304154601AA4HAM3	Pets;Rodents	For the experts: rat has a urethra cyst?	Sally is about 2 1/2 year old female Berkshire, top-eared rat and she's going downhill fast. She had a stroke about 6 months ago that left her sense of balance way off. Just after she recovered from that, we noticed that she was developing a mammary tumor under her left forepaw.      A week or so ago I noticed a hole in her tummy, just above her urethra, that looked like a draining cyst. From my prior experience with rats, the cysts healed on their own. However, this hole has gotten a little bigger, a little shallower, and has started to smell. Additionally, I'm not sure if she's urinating through her urethra anymore. The edge of the hole is right up against it and it doesn't look like it can open very well. I'm changing her cage now twice a week and putting peroxide on the wound to see if it'll help.      I'm hesitant to take her back to the vet, as they consistently misdiagnose my rats.      I think she's in pain and I'm probably going to have my sweet girl euthanized, but I'd really like to know wtf this is... I haven't found anything at ratguide.com yet. ='(

20090304154748AAWEub1	Pets;Cats	My cats and I are itching like crazy!?	I really hope this question falls upon the wise eyes      I rescued a feral kitten 5 months back, when I brought the kitten into   my home I was sure to wash her really well for any mites, dirt, and etc.   I noticed the kitten had an abnormal habit of licking and scratching herself ,   after a while it came to my attention she has bald spots, I did a little Q&A   research and came up with the best estimated guess that the problem she had   is ring worm. I called my friend that is a vet tech and discussed this with her, she   has offered solid pet advice for years, so this time she recommended any    (athletes foot fungus)anti foot fungus cream. (note:yes some human remedies can   and will be used on animals, but NEVER use any human meds., ointments or etc. unless   advised from vet.) I took my friends advice and used this anti fungal cream on the kitten   and it helped clear up the bald patches and reduced the licking/itching as much she but   still continues to do it.... and now two other of my cats are itching and licking and now I'm itching.   After the first couple weeks of having the kitten I was itching a lot, but I thought the desire   to do so was in my head because of the cats constant licking and scratching.   Now I know this problem is bigger than the simple answer of ring worm and some anti fungal cream   solution.      I have done my research and I have come up with what sounds similar to what we have here but I'm not convinced it being scabies or some dander problem after fleas (yes the kitten had fleas when she first arrived, but I killed them and their eggs off quick)   Yesterday I took one of my cats into the vets (not kitten) because my cat has noticeable chunks of fur missing (not like the bald pink scale like sores the kitten had)   The vet offered NO help. She had no answers at all and she said was that the cat I brought in looked fine and that the missing chunks of fur could just be allergies ( even though none of us, not me nor my cats have ever had any signs of allergies the entire time I have had them. Other than the kitten, the rest of the cats I have had 5 yrs and then some) She said as far as the kitten goes she would have to see her and do an evaluation from there. I tell the vet "but the kitten has no more bald spots and shows less signs or symptoms than my other two cats, the kitten has just the same ole scratch and lick repetitiveness" The vet simply replies "it could be an array of things just bring her in".    I feel a better vet would have or at least could have given me a better answer or a list of different things it could be, or any type of possible attempt of a solution         Please if anyone who knows anything about this, please help.   My last resort is to spend even more money at the Dr.s and might end me up with me still scratching my head (pun intended) in wonder of what's really going on.   foot note: The sensation of itching I feel is like microscopic sharp little bites   extra note: I keep myself and my home very clean

We adopted a pregnant cat about a month ago, and her five babies are 8 days old today. i can't believe I haven't noticed yet, but the fourth born baby has a deformed left front leg. She has two big toes with a claw in each and the leg itself is shorter than the other.       I did some research and a website said rubbing and excersing the leg gently could help it...is that true? i dont want to make it worse..      Also..this kitten's eyes are already opening. one is open and the other is particially open. all the rest of the kittens are sealed shut. ..does that mean this kitten might be blind? also....we have homes for four of the kittens. and im thinking this deformed one will be the one left over and the one no one wants..if we brought her to a shelter, would they instantly put her down because she's not perfect? :( please help, i'm freaking out, i feel so bad for her.

20090304155225AAOcUDR	Pets;Dogs	Teaching your dog to follow you?	I have a 1 year old golden retriever, we live out in the country and i want him to walk with me. He's not like one of those dogs that bolt off when they get the chance to. What he does is he follows me for a little while and he'll stay close to me, but he'll just kind of walk off, going to smell something, or doing whatever he wants. If i tell him to come here, he will ignore me, he won't even look up. If i start running in the other direction, he'll wait till he cant see me, then he will start running towards me, right when he gets to me, he'll wonder off again or just keep going past me. How can i teach him to stay right by my side and walk at my pace instead of wondering off.

She always listens to me, rarely listens to him and has even humped him on 2 occassions (which I know is because she considers herself dominant). I have been playing with her ALOT more lately but still, when he leaves for work or whatever, she basically sleeps the ENTIRE time.

20090304163315AAMa4xy	Pets;Cats	Help! please! Kitten....skinned....?	repost of my question.      First off my uncle had a new kitten come to his house.      Then about 2 nights ago, at night he said he heard a racked out side on his back porch, and he said he went outside and seen that something had the kitten cornered, and was on top of the cat.      He said that the object looked like a cat, but was much bigger then a cat, and had a long skinny tail.      He said he chased the object off the porch and that the object darted off the porch, so a possum, or a raccoon is out the question, because they general move slow.      The kitten rang toward the wooded area between our houses, and then a few mins later he heard them again, and he said he knew that the object was after the kitten.      Then today, early he went out to his shed and found the kitten skinned, with only the tail and feet skinned and he said that it looked to him that the kitten was dragged back to the shed and skinned there, the skin was gone.   The kitten's body was intact!         My question is, what kind of animal could it of been??      and why would the animal just skin the cat? and not eat the cat, and just skin part of the cat???      What kind of animal do you think this could be???      HELP!!          * 2 hours ago       * - 4 days left to answer.      Additional Details   We are calling vets, wild life departments      2 hours ago   hunnie, the kitten is DEAD!!!      skinned, no pluse, you can't hope the kitten gets better.      The kitten is no longer alive      My uncle said the skin was "ripped" off looking to him      2 hours ago   I wish the kitten wasn't gone, but there isn't any hope of the kitten being better.      Thank you.. but it can't happen      2 hours ago   The kitten was a stray, he would of taken him inside if the kitten wasn't so scared.      He was feeding it, and had an area, that was warm, with soft area.            EDIT- The object hasn't been back for the kitten's body, so my uncle says, because it's been two days.      2 hours ago
20090304163953AA3VTwJ	Pets;Horses	Argentine snaffle or butterly snaffle?	My 4 year old QH was started in a full cheek snaffle, switched to a wonder bit as a transition to a curb bit. Now he's ready for the switch to a curb bit. He is not a show horse, just my trail buddy. I want him out of the wonder bit because I've heard it causes an elevated head carriage which is why it's so popular with the gaited breeds. He has been a little high headed lately. I ride with very light hands. I've heard good things about butterfly snaffles and argentine snaffles. Can anyone give me a little info about how these bits work and which one is more suitable for a trail horse? My horse is generally laid back, but I had a little trouble stopping him with the full cheek snaffle...he seemed to grab hold of the bit and pull but that also could have been his lack of experience since he was younger when we used that bit. No trouble stopping with the wonder bit. Any suggestions? Thanks

He dies at 17 of old age but kidney failier was the actual thing   so i adopt a cat 2 years ago from an animal shelter. The gave me information on the import ants of giving cat meat as dry food only causes kidney problems and urine infections. so i felt maybe it was my fault my first cat died of kidney failier.   I am looking to adopt a new cat but they don't have a suitable cat so i have gone to another shelter and they recommend dry premium food as it is more cost effective and healthier.

20090304161954AA0gK51	Pets;Cats	My cat has problems what should I do?	My cat is at least 11 years old and he's a half siamese cat. He loves to be round my mum he howls for at least 10 minutes after she comes in. In the nights he used to follow her up stairs to bed but she stopped letting him into her room as he always did his business in her room. He's always been a very noisy cat and howls in the night when there's no one around but lately he's been getting worse I think he maybe trying to bring the house down and since my mum stopped letting him in her bedroom he's been doing his business everywhere else like on the bathroom mat or under the table. My mum will never let him go out in the night in case he gets hurt. We've tried everything to stop him we've locked him in different rooms so he can't howl but he always finds somewhere to do his business we can't lock him in the kitchen with his litter tray because we do'nt have a proper door we've tried all those sprays which are supposed to put him off but nothing works.   We are running out of ideas now and any new ideas would really be appreciated.

20090306164344AAxsKEu	Pets;Dogs	How to teach a dog to roll over?	I'm pet sitting a Yellow Lab for a week. He's a lovely dog, but obviously misses his owner quite a bit. I was thinking that I could help take his mind off things by teaching him a new trick or two. (:   One of the most amusing tricks, I think, is roll over. However, I'm having the hardest time getting him to do so. I've tried a few different methods, but he likes to jump about, which makes my usual method of teaching this trick a little difficult.       (My usual method involves holding a treat in my fist, I'll make him sit, and then lay down, and then hold my fist to one side of his head. I'll then my fist slightly behind his head to the other side. My pug seemed to fall for this easily, but this dog isn't as food obsessed as my pug. :3 So he just turns his head, and my method fails.)      I've also tried physically rolling him over when he tilts onto his back slightly (although he usually doesn't lay on his back, and isn't trained to do so.) but the idea of completely rolling over scares him quite a bit.      Any tips? I'm not used to big dogs, so anything would be helpful. (:

My grand dad came today to pick our poodle up to give him a haircut he left about 15 minutes ago and my Jrt mix well she has been pretty inconsolable.      This might be the first time they've been truely seperated since her spay........I take that back when they were boarded I found out that they were kept in two very different areas and didn't see each other at all for the whole 10 days.      She has calmed down a little but how can I help her.....I know loving on her and telling her it will be okay will just make it worse....      I'm trying to go on with business as usual but it breaks my heart to see her so upset.      Honestly this is the first time I've been alone with her so I want to take advantage of it and work on some training.      I will add she is 100 times more behaved without our poodle here

20090227084855AACNKnB	Pets;Dogs	Anyone have experience with larger dobermans?	I have a doberman who is 3 months old, and 37 lbs.  He is huge, and the breeder said he will be around 130 lbs (he was the biggest in his litter).  I paid 2600 for him with all his testing and pedigrees etc going back to 6 generations.  The dad is 125lbs and the mom is 105 lbs.  They are tested and the dad and mom are clear of Hip Dysplasia (rated OFA excellent), but I am not totally convinced.  I took him to the vet to get his ears taped and there were 4 other dobermans there.  He was huge compared to even the ones that were like 6 months old.  The people commented on his size and such, and they said the sire and dams of their dogs weighed much less, and that my dobe has a really good chance of getting arthritis or HD because of his size, regardless of OFA hip scoring.  I am friends with 2 other breeders who both said their males are only a little over 100 lbs and would never breed to a female who was also huge because of hip/joint problems.  That's when I started getting worried.  Anyone have experience with a much larger dobe (over 110 lbs)?

He's at the point now where he looks you dead in the face and pisses on the floor still inches away from the paper. I'm not talking about a little piss, he pisses out the Niagara Falls. I have to mop everyday and my 1 y.o. gets mad because she can't play on the floor anymore because I'm afraid she'll wind up play in piss or poo. Help!!!!!
20090227082009AAfAm5U	Pets;Dogs	Is this vet cost reasonable?	I took my dog yesterday to the vet for a check up. In the past, he has had fat cysts before under his skin and has had them removed. He now has 3 new lumps. This new vet suggested doing a needle aspiration of each mass (3 of them) and having the fluid checked by a lab. I assumed it would be simple and less costly than the removal surgery. It was simple, but the bill was $350. Most of this was "cytology" lab work to analyze the fluid and make sure it's just fat and not cancer. Does this sound reasonable to anyone who has had this done before on their pet or who is a vet/assistant? Keep in mind there were 3 different masses. My husband thinks we ot taken to the cleaners. I have no idea. Thanks!

But he also has on-going issues with his anal glands. I have successfully dealt with this by giving him a high fibre all natural diet. He is nine, half pomerainian and half terrier and usually really perky and bouncey. Today he was playing catch, but he wasn't as lively and kept trying to end the game by going to his matt and waiting for his treat. Then when we went out for his walk he did his number two and couldn't get it all loose from his back end. He got all embarrassed and sat down. I talked to him and tried to remove it but he felt pain and snareled at me to stop. I picked him up, messy bum and all and carried him home. I usually can put him in a warm tub and he likes it but this time he was really letting me know he hurt. I got some of it off with a cloth, and then he relaxed, had diner and tried to lift his leg to pee, and couldn't. He is sleeping now. It could be his hips or I don't know...geesh, I really don't want to go to the vet. I really can't spend the money now. Any ideas, insight, remedies, or help?

I found one on martinscages and according to a very reliable site, they said gliders (at least young ones) do not need a super huge cage. It would be housing one glider. Don't say gliders will die of lonliness b/c it just isn't true and don't ask what a sugar glider is.    OR    Could I put a baby in the superpet cage that is green and white and has 2 levels and a wheel. Is this safe? (pvc coating)
20090306174112AAaGg9I	Pets;Fish	Good Bacteria Questions ?	Ok so here's my thing, I have done cold water tanks and tropical tanks and I know about how long it takes for each to cycle but I'm curious about the type of bacteria that grows in the tank. If I was to cycle a tank in cold water and then throw in a heater in a couple months would that affect or kill the good bacteria that's in there already ?      What I mean is, I'm sure the two bacterias are close if not the same strain. But will temperature shock kill it off like it would do to fish If a tank was one day cold water and cycled and the next day tropical.       Anyone who knows and can explain it logically and fully gets 10 points.  Thanks.  I plan on doing this that's why I'm asking, either way its gonna happen but it kinda stumped me for a minute. Guess we will find out.

20090306191654AApcVEh	Pets;Cats	When is it ok to declaw cats?	Please no animal rights people jumping on me for this im asking cuz Im curious. I didnt relize when I got my other cat declawed how alot of people felt about it. the vet made it sound like something that was fine and dandy. I had him done just his front cuz anythime he wanted love he would jump on your lap and kneed you like constantly push his feet on you, but he would always have his claws out when he did it to the point we could only pet him on the ground otherwise we would get scratched and not little scratches like bleeding and stuff. He had a habit of sleeping ontop of me well if I coughed or anything he would get scared and jump up and claw the crap outta me the last time it happened I had scratches across my whole stomach and chest and bleed alot. I was so angry and decided the only way we could get along was to have his front claws removed, he was to scared to go outside anyways.  Now my other cat who likes outside but stays around the house has been clawing the crap outta us for no reason! She never used her claws much before only to sharpen them on my leather couch( wich was fine damamge was already done). But yesterday I was laying on the bed petting her head just like she likes and she reached up and clawed me from my elbow almost to my wrist. Then this afternoon she got my boyfriends leg really good he just walked by her and she jumped out and attacked him. I was thinking about having her claws(front) removed if she kept clawing for no reason. Would that be a good enough reason? i dont want it to get to the point that I dont want to pet her for fear of getting attacked. Sorry so long I just dont know what to do with her I love my kitty and I dont want to hurt her but I dont want to have to run from her either.

20090306173850AASDsbT	Pets;Dogs	My dog has been spayed today (against my wishes)... will she be okay, or will she change?	I have a miniature poodle, 9 months old.   My mother would not allow me to take her to the vet unless I would get her "fixed". I'm an adult but I still live with her, so I had to do it.   So after the procedure my dog is very lethargic, and seems depressed. Although I KNOW that she will be like this after surgery and anesthesia, I have a thought in the back of my mind that she will be different once she is healed.   Personally I think that the spaying was cruel and unnecessary, since it is basically a mutilation of a living animal, and also because my dog is an inside dog and I never leave her outside by herself.   Can I be certain that my dog will be alright after this barbaric medical procedure?

I am having a lot of trouble training him to use the wee wee pads. He was doing very well the first day, and used the pad 7 out of 8 times. Today, every time I bring him to the wee wee pad he sits on it. I feel like he's staying there to make me happy and as soon as sits for a few seconds he gets up to leave. Then instead of peeing on the pad he went on the floor by my bed. Any advice would be great, and help me to understand what could make him think the wee wee pad is a place to sit. Did I do something wrong? Thank you.
20090306165455AAs51m9	Pets;Birds	My parakeet trusts me one day and doesn't the next day. Then he does and then he doesn't. What can I do?	His name is Cuba, I bought him from a petshop. They couldnt tell me if my bird was a male or female. So i am pretending its a male hah. It is very comfortable in its cage, loves all the toys it has, eats the seeds, and eats the vegetables and protein i place in a tiny plate (for teacups). He also drinks his water too. I did a lot of research before i got him, so i knew how to introduce him to knew foods. I made him a swing for his cage because it was too expensive at the petstore for something i could easily make. It its made from wood and wire. I wrapped it in a cute pink fabric. He loves to sleep on the swing i think he made it into his bed haha. I also play music for my bird, i found that soo far he loves to listen to Ruth Brown. Also Big Mama Thornton and many more blues artists. He also loves some rockabilly music ive played for him lol. He doesn't like New Age music which is weird lol. I played him some mozart on the first day i got him but i think it just scared him since he was in a new enviroment and it was bedtime for him when i got him. But he got comfortable fast. Ill still try the Mozart Effect on him though haha. I put a mirror in the cage on the floor, with feathers i got from Michaels, covering it on the border. I also talk to him and ask him if hes comfortable and that he looks very pretty and try thinkin of words that start w the sounds of K and T and stuff cause i read somewhere off google they liked those sounds. His cage is also next to a window in my bedroom which i open the blinds and curtain every morning when i take of that sheet blanket over his cage. So he can get sunlight he also make conversation with the birds he hears in the tree next to my window. His bird cage is in my bedroom btw. The only noise he hears is music from my laptop which i play for him lol and it gets him hyper usually thats what gets him to start eat the the vegetables and proteins and fruit on the plate. I have had the bird for a week.   So now you know about Cubas Cage and a little about him and me.   On the days I can allow him to fly around in my room ill open the cage door and slowly display my hand w my index finger so he can stand on it. Some days he will have no problem and some days he will fly off the the corner. the bird cage is not very huge. just enough for one bird, its the 3 or 2nd biggest size i think.. its the one with the two bars for the birds to stand on. So i've just open the cage door and let him fly out whenever he feels most comfortable to. which he does after he listens to music for like ten min lol. and after he flys for like 3 mins he flys next to me or a couple feet away but still next to and falls asleep. then with a lot of patience he will go on my finger and let me slowly walk him infront of the door in his cage and he'll fly in and stand on his bar lol and ill tell him Good Cuba! or sometimes i say "Cooba" or ill say Very Smart Parakeet or something lol    so how do i make him trust me more? i mean its only been a week but he got comfortable fast. god its so cute when he puffs up before he sleeps and he makes that sleepy tweet sound. lol   so anyone can help me with anything i can do better or stop doing or anything that is irrelevant that can still help me lol usually when i have questions i just type it in google and read forums or websites haha.   thank you everyone for your time!      -Lulu
20090306165541AAM5nTf	Pets;Dogs	Should I stop my dog from growling at people?	We got our dog at the humane society and he's a german sheppard, rotweiler, newfoundland mix, and he's very docile. He gets real excited and loves to play, but sometimes he will growl real low at people...so far it's just been my sister and my one friend from work that my dog has growled at. My fiancee tells me that he's just showing his dominance to new people in the house, but it scares them and makes them nervous, and I feel bad that they have to feel that way when they come over.      My sister and friend don't really like dogs, so even though they're nice to him & will pet him, I think he still senses their nervousness around him, therefore taking advantage of making himself known as the dominant one.      My fiancee also told me NOT to teach him to stop growling at them, because he says its their warning sign and eventually he'll just nip or bite right away, instead of warning people first. He said it'd be just like telling someone to not say "I'm going to hit you if you don't stop", and for them to just go ahead and hit someone without warning.      I read that it's ok for them to growl during play, which he does, but he doesn't try to bite at all during tug-of-war, he drops his toy right away when I tell him to, and I'll put my hand up to his mouth to make sure he's not being aggressive and he licks it everytime.   I also read that you SHOULD teach your dog to NOT growl at people, but my fiancee tells me otherwise, so what's the best thing to do? What's going to be safest?? I don't want people to come to my house and feel scared that my dog is going to bite them, but I also don't want to teach my dog the wrong thing and make it more likely that he'll bite someone. I understand that all dogs/animals are unpredictable, but he's such a nice and playful dog.

20090306193557AALpyPZ	Pets;Dogs	What could this be on my dog's paw?	I have a 4 year old Schnoodle. (Schnauzer/Poodle mix) About 4 hours ago I noticed that she was limping and protecting her rear paw. She is a tough dog, so when I saw her limping I tried to take a look but she seemed upset about it so I decided to leave her alone. I put some Bag Balm (we use this on her cracked paws in the winter) on and left her. Now, usually her limping subsides within 2 to 3 hours, but 4 hours had gone by so I decided to take another look. When I went to look at it I noticed how swollen her paw was. In between her 2nd and 3rd nails I saw a lot of redness and as I looked closer I saw two little pus, sack-ish things. Now she has been eating and drinking and is acting normal besides the limping, but I am worried it might be an infection. I'm going to for sure take her to the vet tomorrow, but I would like to know if that's soon enough and if you guys have any ideas of what it could be.      Thanks!

It's constantly chasing cars  and I am afraid it will get killed.  The neighbors let it out for the day and I feed and care for it (comb it and play with it) and I feel sorry for it out on bitter cold nites.

It's their responsibility.  But, they are too busy.  They have to call me to ask to send up the dog so it can play with the grand kids.  Help.  I'm worried about the little dog.
20090306195115AACA7nC	Pets;Horses	Bloody discharge from udder?	Hi guys, I know this is a disgusting question, but it can't be avoided. My daughter's pony is older than dirt (around 35) but still going strong. We've tried to retire her multiple times, but she gets really depressed! Anyway, I went to clean around her udders the other day and noticed one is swollen, like it would be if she were lactating (We have no stallions on the property, so there's no chance of her being pregnant), and to investigate, I squirted a little out. It was uncomfortable for her and when I looked down at my hand, there was a milky, bloody discharge from her udder. My husband is a vet and has informed me it's not an infection...does anyone have any idea on what this could possibly be?

I will be moving into an apartment with my boyfriend soon, and we discussed possibly getting him a doggie bed to sleep in.       The only problem is, is that I have tried this with him before and he ends up waking up in the middle of the night, getting into things he shouldn't be in, and pottying on the floor. Kennels do not work, he just whines and cries all night. So my question is, how can I get Bruiser (my chihuahua) to be more comfortable in sleeping in his own bed, and actually staying in it?
20090306205326AA7IzyZ	Pets;Other - Pets	Is it okay to euthanize my ferret?	My ferret has adrenaline disease and is three years old. I have one other ferret, a male, who is perfectly healthy. The problem is, surgery is going to cost around 800$ and if it ends up being on the right side it could be over 1'000$ not to mention the cost if there is complications. After the surgery you have to give them monthly shots and constant check-ups at the vet, which over their life span will cost anywhere from 200$ to 1'000$, depending on how much longer they live.      I'm a high school student, saving up for college. Would I be a terrible person for letting my ferret live as long as she is still happy for and then euthanizing her when she becomes too sick? I can't afford these costs, I only have 300$ saved up for them for emergencies, and my family can't afford to help me out either. When I go to college how am I going to afford the ongoing costs of this disease?       Euthanizing seems like the only way to go :( any suggestions?

20090306211702AAC7nE7	Pets;Cats	My newly adopted cat won't eat.?	I have adopted a 3 year old cat from the local shelter and it won't eat! It has been just under 2 weeks.      I have tried all different foods; dry/wet, heated and cold, tuna, tuna water, treats...everything. I have taken her to the vets twice, blood work and x-rays are normal. They have told me to force feed her which I have been doing for two days with watered down food through a syringe.       My question pertains to what some cat owners have told me. They say that because she is in a new home she won't eat right away. Should I just keep force feeding her until I notice she is eating on her own? I'm afraid that if I keep feeding her this way she'll get used to it and won't eat on her own at all. 2 weeks seems like more than enough time to get used to my place right?      Has anyone else had this problem? Any tips you could give me?      Oh, she is drinking water on her own and using the kitty box on her own.  Seems like everything is normal. She is energetic and very loving. Doesn't seem depressed, sleeps a lot but not so much that it seems abnormal.      I guess I don't know what to do anymore. Force feeding sucks for both of us. Should I just continue waiting?

20090306213051AA4ZEvX	Pets;Birds	Does anybody know how to fix asymmetrical pecks?	I'm a sophomore in highschool and I've been lifting for a while now, my bench press max is 230, so I have a relatively strong chest. However, I'm not sure I've been using propper technique, because I've been being bothered by some differences between my pecks, my left is more firm and easy to flex than my right, and where my chest meets my armpit it's nice and cut on my left side but just kinda flabby on my right. Can anyone think of some excersized that I can do to target my chest/armpit area directly?

20090306213023AAIEwcM	Pets;Cats	My senior cat is urinating on rug when I'm out of town. What can I do?	I travel quite a bit and leave my two cats home alone for up to 4 or 5 days at a time.  The last two times I left for several days, my senior cat urinated on a throw rug each time. I know it was her because I caught her doing it again after I didn't clean the first rug correctly. She only does this when I leave, and seems to be healthy otherwise. Is there anything I can do to prevent this? I assume this is just a behavioral issue, but what else should I look for health wise?

20090227101014AAEUxKa	Pets;Dogs	I have an 11-year old dog that pees in the house, this is not a new behavior.  How can I retrain him?	I inherited my grandmothers dog.  She has had him since he was a year or two old.  He developed the nasty habit of peeing in the house while she had him.  She had times that she could not move well and did not always let him out in time, or did not notice that he needed to go out.  I have only had him for a month and am trying to get him house-broke.  I let him out every hour or so.  The only time he goes longer than an hour without going out is if he is sleeping.  I let him out as soon as he wakes up.  He still pees in the house though.  The other day he was outside for over an hour and within five minutes of me letting him in, he peed!  He never acted like he had to go back out.  He was laying down then he just got up walked to the other side of the room and lifted his leg.      I know that he basically needs to be retrained, but how do I go about doing this?  I have never had to house train a dog on my own.

20090227091903AADsokC	Pets;Other - Pets	Help me with a problem with my 'caring' grandma?	i don't take care of my so-called-dogs, because my nana takes care of them. sure, i feed them at 3:30 and shizz, but otherwise, she won't let me do anything. we have four dogs and a cat (and nobody even cares about the cat but me..), and she's fully convinced that i canNOT take care of a ferret. i've been looking up on ferrets for about three weeks, and i know a whole lot. i've even watched videos. my grandpa is deciding, and nana's all "no. he's going to say no." and even when i ask "but what if he says yes?" she repeats what she says. she's also basically like "even if he says yes, we're not getting one." but she's the one that said "it's up to michael."   even if we did end up getting one, noone would want to touch it but me, so i'd have to take care of it, since i wouldn't want it to die. i know that you have to bathe it once a month, clean out its litter twice a day, clean the cage once a week, clip it's nails every two weeks, and a whole bunch more. plus, i love ferrets more than any other animal. i have all the time in the world too, since i'm homeschooled. school only takes about..1-3 hours, and the rest of the day i KNOW i would spend with my ferret!   my grandma's a dog person..so "my" dogs aren't even mine really. oh, and she also said "we'll get rid of your two dogs and i'll /think/ about it." so i said "sure!" and she went all "OHMYGOD. WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF /MY/ DOGS."      is this fair? and how can i convince her and michael that i can take care of a ferret? i've already hit both of them with all the ferret facts i know (which is aLOT).   oh, and don't go all "you're a CHILD. you're not good enough for this. your grandma is right, you don't deserve one. be happy with your four dogs and cat. blahblahblahblah."   this is yahoo answers. they promise that people are going to answer my questions, not go off on me on..

Each time I see him sniffing around, when he wakes up after a nap, once he's finished eating, I take him outside. When he does his business outside I praise him, then let him back in.   If I catch him doing his business inside I quickly take him outside, and say no!      If I keep doing this, how long until can I expect him to be fully house trained?
