I recommened Antec or Thermaltake. Check newegg.com for prices.Recommened at least 500W. Depending on your other specs, You need to make sure you have a PCIe x 16 slot on your mother board.

T6V9zXymaa	Edit: If you have access to a "thumb" drive, or your sister has a CD burner on her machine, you could download the software I mentioned, copy it to the drive/CD and then transfer it to your PC.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it might come down to you completely restoring your computer in order to bring it back to original factory condition.<br>  <br>  Before you go that route, however, I'd recommend downloading some well-established and well-known anti-malware tools. You definitely did the right thing in running Spybot, but I'd also consider installing and using both AdAware and Windows Defender (from Microsoft). Make sure you get both of these programs from their own websites and not a third-party site. I've included links, below.<br>  <br>  It also can't hurt to have current anti-virus software on your machine. AVG Anti-Virus is free and would probably be a good place to start, but you might want to invest in a more effective and accurate piece of software. BitDefender and Kaspersky are two excellent programs in the under $30 price range. I've included a review link to help along those lines.<br>  <br>  Spyware Guard is notorious for tricking people into thinking they have a problem and then downloading their malware-infected software in order to fix it. Don't feel that you're alone in this. Overall, it sounds like you're pretty savvy as far as these things go, which is always the best defense: being aware of how adware/malware/trojans/viruses work and how to prevent them.<br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse, you could either go back to a Windows "save point" using System Restore. Failing that, it might require a complete recovery or operating system reinstall.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|dILqe7nBaa	reinstall xp|`|99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	It sounds like you have already done a lot.<br>  <br>  It is, generally, possible to remove these forms of malware, and any others that you have manually or through utilities that you have available.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the best option is to format the drive and reinstall everything.  However, if you want to try and work on removing these items I would start with the reader_s.exe<br>  <br>  You should be able to remove this with a program called Hijack This<br>  Freely distributed: <a href="http://www.download.com/Trend-Micro-HijackThis/3000-8022_4-10227353.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Trend-Micro-Hija...</a><br>  <br>  Be careful: Hijack This does not report on only bad things - it reports everything.  You only want it to remove the reader_s.exe<br>  <br>  You might be able to use it to remove the SG 2008 as well.  If nothing else, it might help to know what else is running on your system and the hijackthis program will do that.<br>  <br>  If you want assistance, then feel free to email me (irishtek@yahoo.com) the log generated from hijackthis.<br>  <br>  I have seen some references to the infestation made by SG 2008.  It might be possible to manually delete the files and the registry settings.  I'd be willing to help you go through that as well if HijackThis doesn't get rid of it.

I used to bluetooth stuff from my phone to my dads mac all the time, but couldn't to bluetooth photo printers as my phone didn't deem them secure enough because they didn't support a password imput, so you could check your phone and comps security settings too, sorry I couldn't be of more help, don't waste money on a dongle in a hurry though!|`|GxofM7X0aa	No, you do not require a dongle unless the two bluetooth chip sets are not compatible (it happens sometimes).  You will need to make sure you see the computer's bluetooth name on your phone along with an access code that is setup on your computer in order for you to transfer files from your phone to your computer.  Once you see your computer and are able to attach to it via the access codes and such, you should be able to browse to a folder where you want to store your files from your phone.  The same holds true for transferring files from your computer to your phone.  You browse out to the folder on your computer and copy the files to your phone.  I know this is overly simplified but every phone and computer has their unique settings that require you to modify the steps I've gone through here.

ITT was good but very expensive.  If you think you need to go to a college and cannot do an online class, check out your local places and if you can do online i HIGHLY recommend using WGU, it's accredited and very cheap.  cost at WGU is about $6000/year, cost at ITT was $18,000/year.<br>  <br>  While you are attending the VA sends the GI bill money directly to you and not to your school, so as long as you are attending 12 hours/week (i think it is) you get $1300+college bonus money put directly into your account tax free.  so you can make out like a fat rat while attending college as well.<br>  <br>  I would recommend taking a general It cirrciulum, then deciding on what your focus should be.  don't decide too early exactly what you want to do because you may get locked into an area that you don't like.<br>  <br>  <edit> oops i completely misread your post LOL

If this is the case, then you need to either contact the store or dealer where you bought your laptop and see what you course of action needs to be.  They may take care of it in-house (meaning in the store) but many times it goes back to the manufacturer (HP in this case) and they do the repairs there. Other than this, you may be blocking the air vents along the bottom and side and / or rear of the laptop.  If you do not allow the fan to cool off some of the components (primarily the CPU) in a laptop, then you can permanently harm your laptop and it will cost you more to fix it than it would be to replace the laptop.  The immediate course of action is to observe your laptop and where the air vents are.  Next, pay attention to where you use it and see if by chance you are covering up one or more of these vents while you are using it.  You also may want to feel near the vents while the laptop is up and running to make sure the fan is running; hence, keeping it cool.  If you cannot feel the air movement, then put your ear near one of the vents and see if you can hear the fan.  It is possible that the fan has gone out.  The fan is critical to using your laptop.  Without it you can damage your laptop beyond repair.  Lastly, you may want to invest in a laptop cooler pad available at many retail stores that sell laptops.  Some coolers draw their power from one of the laptop's USB ports where others need to be plugged into a wall outset.  These pads are for the sole purpose of cooling your laptop down so that you can continue to use them for extended periods of time.  These cooler pads are not a replacement for a laptop fan that has gone out.  Please understand that statement.  No action on your part will certainly decrease how long your laptop will remain functional.  Heed the warning.|`|KFagjt8Jaa	Goto the HP website and click on Live Support, and talk to one of their technicians for free.|`|Qlpj04L3aa	It sounds like it is overheating. You should find out if it is still under warranty. Call HP customer service.<br>  There are also ways to keep your laptop cool like cooling pads. You might want to look into one of those. Make sure the laptop is on a flat surface so it can draw air in to cool itself. Don't pile junk on or around it either.

But you are better off getting one of the free programs that will update. A security program that does not update is not worth having on your computer. Norton use to still run after your subscription ran out. I heard they where going to stop that. After your subscription ran out it would just stop working. I don't know if that is something they did or did not do. Here's a site that give good deals on Norton Internet Security. A one user license is very cheap. Plus they have free shipping, It only took me 4 days to get my software from them.<br>  <a href="http://www.computersworth.com/category.cfm?cat=124&catname=Norton%20%2F%20%20Symantec" rel="nofollow">http://www.computersworth.com/category.c...</a>

AA12271834	Technically Mac laptops are superior to HP Laptops (they are more powerful and their operating system uses the powerful hardware more effectively).<br>  <br>  That being said you need to decide witch laptop is best for you.  If you are very comfortable with the Windows environment and all of its programs (ie Microsoft Word) then you should consider the HP Laptop.  Microsoft Office for the Mac is a joke and iWorks blows it out of the water.  <br>  The Mac will do everything you need and more (and yes they have Greenpeace's highest rating for eco-friendly laptops, tied with Sony).  You will have to get use to Mac OS X though.  I would go into the store and play around on it for a while.  Give yourself a list of tasks you would do on the laptop and try to do each of them on the Mac.  If you can do them quickly and effectively then I would get a Mac.<br>  <br>  Things to try:<br>  * Open the internet, search for a favourite site, and bookmark it<br>  * Open up the word processor program, write a short note, spell check it (making sure the spellchecker is in your language), save the file in a Microsoft .doc format (this will be important when your at school).<br>  * etc.|`|YOIycFeNaa	I would go with a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Sorts documents, latest Wi-Fi internet, and cannot get viruses. You can run Microsoft Office (word, excel, etc.) on a Mac also. Macs are very eco-friendly. And I just got a MacBook Pro and I will NEVER go back to a PC.|`|C3eiGmOFaa	If you want cute, buy Mac. If you want functional, go for the PC.|`|6v0D7Mthaa	I had an HP laptop when I first started college.  It was a HP Pavillion 9500 and I spent like 1,800 bucks in it.  It was a very good computer it ran on Vista Ultimate but after a year and a month, the motherboard died.  I didn't have a protection plan on it so HP told it would cost me 950 bucks to repair it!!!  I was furious and I personally don't like HP anymore.  Now I have a Macbook Pro and it is awesome.  You don't need to get an anti-virus like you would in a PC, but you can still get viruses but it is very and I mean very unlikely.  I would go with a Mac but if you like PCs more go get a Toshiba, Lenovo, or Fujitsu.  They are the best and one thing I would recommend is get and extended warranty!!!  Trust me you never know what will happen in the future so protect your investment!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped<br>  <br>  P.S. Apple offers discounts for students and you can also get them in Best Buy for Mac products.  Also you will have to buy Word separately from the computer, neither include the program.|`|P0Ikn6IUaa	I've got a HP but I'm after a Mac. Mac's are so much better because you can run Windows and Mac OS on them, you have to tweak a HP computer to run Mac OS on it. Therefore, I feel that Macs are better. <br>  <br>  And btw, theres no difference in virus protection between a Dell and HP, so to answer your question. HPs are not different at avoiding viruses.<br>  <br>  Also, you won't get MS Word for free!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|aH7IBJzVaa	For your situation, I would recommend a Mac. Unless you were going into gaming, i would recommend a PC. I have an HP dv6910us which is currently not running due to ac adapter issue. but replacement is on the way for free. But if the mac is too expensive at the moment, i would go with something on the cheap side, the lowest brand i would recommend is Toshiba. and i would NEVER recommend Dell/eMachine. But a Toshiba will be good,|`|030531ee855433dc337dbac40412f7c6aa	First comparing HP and MAC doesn't work. That's like saying should I drive a Chevy vehicle, or get a bike. <br>  <br>  Your real question should be should I get a PC(Windows based) or should I get a MAC.<br>  <br>  A PC is going to be much cheaper hardware wise. A much larger selection of software, and allow you to do a lot more. <br>  <br>  On the downside of PC's. Because of the way the operating system is written PC's are more vulnerable to viruses. I am a firm believe though that if you aren't an idiot and go to websites/download things that you shouldn't you aren't going to get a virus anyways. Plus most viruses are nothing more than annoyances. I have been running differant versions of windows for 7 years without any virus protection and have gotten only two viruses, neither of which were serious issues.<br>  <br>  As far as a MAC goes. They are slightly more user friendly. And because of the way they are made, are less prone to viruses. <br>  <br>  They cost more, have less software available. Saying that they can run MAC OS or Windows is just dumb, if you bought a MAC I sure hope you're not putting Windows on it as the only PRO's for getting a MAC are related to MAC OS, since the hardware itself you are already paying more for.|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	To add to what Nick said, the key for viruses is watching what you go to. Anyone can accidently click something and go "CRAP!" and back out. I've done it recently actually. <br>  I run very very minimum virus prot (just AVG free) and I've never had a virus, ever. I've thought that I had one before, but it was usually something else or I fixed the problem before it became a serious issue.<br>  I prefer PCs. Macs are really great for graphic and web designers but for anything else, they're overpriced and useless. If you're just a student needing to save things, why pay extra for things you don't need? You can get a basic PC laptop for $400-$500 versus a basic Mac for $900.|`|AA11792654	i would recommend an HP because they always seem to work perfectly fine. I know that Macs get less viruses but you can install a program to your HP to help block viruses. My friend has a Mac and she doesn't really like it because her keys get stuck sometimes and that it is harder to understand. she doesn't seem to like it much. so overall i would go with an hp.

WebKit was orginally adopted by Apple as the actual framework for Konqueror and utilized in Safari in OS X.<br>  <br>  WebKit was released as the open-source framework for web-browsers in 2005. Many mobile models incorporated WebKit because of it's KDE Javascript engine.

3dv7Qdoxaa	When picking a Power Supply Unit (PSU), you really only need to look at the motherboard, graphics card, and CPU. <br>  <br>  The motherboard will tell you whether you need to have a 20 pin or 24 pin power connector to plug into the motherboard. <br>  <br>  The graphics card and CPU will tell you how much wattage you will need, approximately. <br>  <br>  Since you have a mid to low range CPU and graphics card, you probably won't need more than a 500 Watt PSU.|`|8QWr77YZaa	Dont upgrade to AMD!!!  Intel is the best you can get right now when it comes for processors.  I know AMD used to be the shiznit for gaming pc's, but that is simply not the case anymore.<br>  <br>  Right now, you can get the Intel i7 920 Processor for 230$ which is insane.<br>  <br>  With that said, your reasoning for getting a quadcore processor I would assume and knowing all these specs are for "video intensive purposes".  From video editing to gaming.<br>  <br>  Point is If you want to run any game flawless an Sli or Crossfire is useful.  Having 2 video cards will cause a need for more power.<br>  <br>  Power supply is totally dependent on the processor and amount of video cards.<br>  <br>  If you want a good video card (GTX 295 or ATI HD4870x2)  You are going to need about 700-800 watts with a processor like that as well.  If you want 2 cards then you are gonna have to up your watts again.<br>  <br>  Power supply is totally dependent upon what you dump into your pc.|`|8ec7e3cbbcacf0843865206e98565509aa	Minimum PSU for a NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT is 350 watts and if you have 420 watter than you'll be fine. NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT is almost similiar to ATI Radeon HD 4650 DDR 2 (some use GDDR 2 or 3) If you can try to get a Video card that uses GDDR for faster performance. Most newer cards are going that route.<br>  The card you have is alright but you won't be able to play GTA 4.<br>  Don't get a PSU upgrade unless your getting a card which minimum specs require a 450 watt PSU.

1EN9ngsbaa	You should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube.

k5KuYkkKaa	Yes, a tuner card can be placed in the PCIe x1 slot, and a graphics card can be placed in the PCIe x16 slot. The tuner card uses very little power, but the graphics card, depending on which one you chose, can use quite a bit. That system only has a 250W power supply, small by todays standards, so unless you want a very low power graphics card that probably won't be much better than your on board chip, you'll need to upgrade your PSU (power supply unit). You should look around some more, the Pentium is a good processor, but it's yester-years technology. Try finding something with a Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad with 4-6GB of memory. They will come with a 300-400W PSU that will be able to handle a tuner card and a decent graphics card too.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Since this machine has an integrated GPU "chip" and an available PCIe slot, you can buy a graphics card with TV out (tuner) to replace it.

Someone who downloads/ adds and deletes lots of files frequently will find the drives getting fragmented faster than others. <br>  I run CCleaner once a week and defrag is managed automatically by Diskeeper. It can be set to run in real time background mode. It defrags even as you continue working and also does a great job with as less as 5% free space.<br>  If you are using the Windows defragger you have to be sure that the drive free space doesnt drop below 15% as thats the bare minimum needed for it to defrag.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Defrag is dependent upon frequency of usage. Defrag more frequently if fragmentation builds up quicker.<br>  <br>  Or, use an automatic defragmenter like the excellent Diskeeper 2009 that will monitor fragmentation levels and silently defrag in the background when necessary, without bothering you. Diskeeper the best defragger for Windows anyway.

dkpIjt5jaa	Whatever card you go for, that power supply is the WEAK link !<br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 2 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic cards), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+112(128MB X 8 X 2 = 2Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+30+25 = 412<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation for the simple reason I don't know all the facts about your machine so compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 500 Watts and get up to 600 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  Best PSU manufacturers at the moment are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  As for GDDR3 and DDR2, these are completely different, the first is Graphics memory found on GPU cards and the second is system RAM.<br>  <br>  The circuitry of the GPU card handles the GDDR3 and when you connect it via PCIe, the OS uses it from the card for graphics purposes only.<br>  <br>  <br>  For a guide on several aspects of installation including GPU, check this: <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,1977317,00.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,28...</a>|`|k5KuYkkKaa	With a 305W PSU the best nVidia card will be a 9400GT, but it's not too good for gaming. You can get them for 60-65 bucks. If you're willing to spend 140 for a GPU, spend 60 for a decent power supply. You'll need a 450-500W PSU if you want to be able to use a $140 card.|`|TtZ9zQpraa	I recommend the 4830. It's just like the 9800GT but a lot cheaper. It's a high end card for cheap ($114). ASUS is a good manufacturer for it too:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121289" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  You don't have to worry about DDR2vs3 on a video card fitting into your motherboard. You only worry about that when you are changing your RAM (not your video RAM). For your motherboard, you just worry about the PCI port, which looks like you are good to go. 2GB of RAM is good enough, it shouldn't matter when changing your video card. I would also suggest upgrading the 305W power supply to maybe 600-650W to make sure you get enough power to run the video card. Good luck.|`|cxiPvqtsaa	lot of gaming person use EVGA series card

All you need to do is insert the Win 2K disk when Win ME is running and it should ask you if you want to upgrade your current Windows.  <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend doing a Windows update once Win 2K is installed so that you can get all the service packs.  There are some major security holes that are fixed in the service packs.|`|XpJFIUCpaa	FYI: <br>  In some cases it could better to back up your files and format the drive so you able to install win 2000 to a clean disk; it will cause less problem later on with the old ME files still on the system.

zedTYkeqaa	It all depends, the first thing i WOULD do is defragment your hard drive, if it is 85% full and you hven't done that it can actually wear the drive down faster as it has to search for everything. Once you defragment it you should see a difference in speed as well as make it easier on the hard drive. The drive making noises are also a sign that it is about to go out, but that depends on how old it is. If it's a few years old i'd back stuff up and get a new one, you can get a 1TB drive for around 100 bucks at best buy these days. or go to tigerdirect.com for other deals, from the sounds of it though, it may be the way hitachi builds thier drives if both of yours have done this.|`|m5J36D28aa	No, they should be perfectly quite.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	If you drive is making sounds, you dont want to take chances. Backup important data in anycase especially since its full and fragmented. A highly fragmented drive which is also full can be pretty unstable.<br>  <br>  Its important to run diskcleanup and defrag regularly to prevent drive problems. On a highly fragmented drive, the HDD head has to work more to access files. <br>  <br>  I would recommend that you uninstall whatever stuff you dont need, run diskcleanup or CCleaner and then defragment with Diskeeper. It can be set to run in automatic mode. It defrags even under less than 15% free space.

If so you might be able to roll back to an earlier version by downloading from the manufacture website.

RfPoIkThaa	I am a very affordable web designer! For a simple 2-3 page site it would only be about 150-200. But depending on how complicated the uploading is (is it automatically put on site, or is it sent to you and you put it on yourself) it would probable cost about 200-300. Please feel free to contact me with any questions! <br>  <br>  My site is urlocalwebdesigner.com  jonahkatz@urlocalwebdesigner.com|`|EWx4bd8Naa	Totally depends on the programmer you're using and how in depth you're getting with your submissionsâbut, based on personal experience for 2 to 3 pages I would guess anywhere from $500-$1,000. Just a rough guess. I would just start by asking around for estimates. Hope this helps.|`|ioQJgAu5aa	Sorry...I have no idea...|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Well this is what I use for my site and it's free<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.box.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/</a><br>  <br>  you create an account, then they give a snipped of code, kinda like the youtube embed code.

Again, depending on the features you want. <br>  <br>  This does not even address the concern of getting the website hosted and who is hosting it.<br>  <br>  If you want to open a correspondence with me (irishtek@yahoo.com), then I can tell you the work that would go into your website and set your expectations better.

pXzvu866aa	emp[k]="Hello"; <--- assignment of char* to Emp is invalid.<br>  <br>  If you want the str in one of your Emp structs to reference a string, such as "Hello", you can do something like this:<br>  <br>  emp[k].str = (char *)malloc(strlen("Hello") + 1);<br>  strcpy(emp[k].str,"Hello");|`|QoTPsIc6aa	Well for very obvious reason, this is a code segment not a complete program.   I assume you know that you will need to put this in the main routine.<br>  After you do that, there is another problem.   emp[k] is a structure not an actual variable.   so emp[k] = "hello" does not mean anything.   You need to emp[k].str = "hello";

If you wish to change the time at which it does this, go to windows update on the start menu (or sub-menu, depending on your operating system) and you should be able to change the timer by following the directions on the screen.

FPsR2xi7aa	I personally use Eraser: <a href="http://www.heidi.ie/node/6" rel="nofollow">http://www.heidi.ie/node/6</a> because it's designed specifically to do data destruction, and HDCleaner is more angled towards improving performance of your HD.  <br>  <br>  What Erasre does is a Gutmann overwrite which conformes to the Department of Defense (DoD) standard for data deletion of sensitive and top-secret materials.  After destroying data with the Gutmann method (Or indeed a multi-pass random noise scrub), it's pretty much impossible to recover data even with magnetic force microscopy, which is the most effective (and expensive) known method of data reconstruction.  <br>  <br>  True, it might be possible to reconstruct data after a Gutmann wipe.  However, the time and cost required to do so would pretty much prevent anyone but government intelligence from recovering the data.  And if the government really wants insurance information about you clients, they probably already have it.<br>  <br>  If you really want to get rid of data from an entire drive, I recommend DBAN's boot and nuke.  With DBAN run either the Gutmann or a 15 pass random noise write.  This will annihilate data beyond what even the DoD requires to destroy top-secret documents (assuming the hard drive is being re-used by the department).<br>  <br>  However, I've heard that HDCleaner does destroy data.  I have no personal experience of using HDCleaner for this though, as I have not tested it for data deletion.<br>  <br>  As mentioned by the poster below, encrypting your hard drives is a great way to decrease the likelyhood of your data being stolen, both before and after deletion.  One of the best encryption programs to be had is Trycrypt: <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truecrypt.org/</a> .|`|sYxUVBvPaa	to be honest with you there is no such thing as "gone forever" unless you break the hard drive into pieces. Even with a cleaner those files can be pulled up again by someone who really wants them. The best you can do is encrypt the data while its on your drive, then, when you delete it, it will be harder to get at.

M7i30zP6aa	You have to understand what DNS means.  It basically means what resolving a hostname to IP Address.  For example, www.yahoo.com = 209.131.36.158. <br>  <br>  DNS servers usually cache/store the request for 24 hours so it will not have to do the same look up all the time.  <br>  <br>  It really doesn't help much for majority of the users out there.  It will not removing any tracing cookie at all.  One example why this is useful would be let's say if you are on a corporate network and you use this ABC website every day. Some IT guy changed that website with a brand new IP address and when you try to access the site it can't resolve the new address since it's cached on your system.  Doing the ipconfig /flushdns will clear out that cache and your computer will try to get a fresh IP that tires to the site you want to go.

If you see the need of using the computer outside of your house alot then definitely get the MacBook.  But if you use iphone 3G then that should take care of your portable computer needs so go with the iMac.

tOCESHLYaa	No a computer does not have to be a certain model. Safari 4 is suppose to be more secure than the other version of Safari. But It's a beta, It's not ready yet, so you will have issues with it. You should wait in till it's ready and out of beta. If you are looking for a good browser try firefox, Opera, or any of the browsers that are not in beta.|`|ZY9I6my5aa	yes they finally released it its not beta anymore just go to <a href="http://apple.com/safari" rel="nofollow">http://apple.com/safari</a> its ready to go and works pretty well except some top sites issues it does not work on mine but worked when i installed it at school well whatever you should try it though works great but it looks almost just like google chrome (nice apple copy everyones idea why don't ya) well good luck and have fun :)|`|BtVMHBDfaa	No it doesn't, don't worry. With browsers you don't have to have different models. However with Safari 4, you do have to make sure your computer has a quite recently up-to-date graphics card. I have never used safari myself personally, but I did download it yesterday and have experimented with it a bit and noticed several issues. Firstly it takes up much more CPU usage, which will slow your computers temporary performance down quite a bit.<br>  <br>  As it's a BETA there are a few flaws an bugs with it, but not too much to worry about. I do find the flash appearance slows it down a little, and it would probably run more effectively on a computer with more RAM.<br>  <br>  The tab system still needs a bit of work with Safari 4 and changing preferences and options also needs Apples attention as well.<br>  <br>  Yet it is still fast and I would definetly recommend it when the BETA has finished.<br>  <br>  For now though, I would honestly recommend Firefox 3.0 for now. I have it at the moment, and have always used it. It really does come out on top of all the browsers on performance. Another key advantage it boasts is the security it provides. It does not use nearly as much as Safari does on CPU usage, its tab system is great, it is by far one of the fastest browsers on the market at the moment (granted Safari is supposed to be right now, but that's overlooked by its flaws in its BETA stage), runs Java amazingly, has the best plugin's/ add-ons/ downloadable content as well, and a whole bunch of other reasons. It's easy to install and very quick.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

So if you can ping the computer, but cannot see the resources in Network Neighborhood, then you don't have the sharing configured correctly. Also, you need to go to "My Computer" and give your peer network a name, like "Workgroup". It is easier if both have the same name.|`|YDmf4RFKaa	Do you have a router at home, then it is pretty simple..<br>  <br>  Just connect both the laptop and the desktop to the internet via the router.

HPnmh25Faa	You have a couple of options with varying degrees of legality and success:<br>  <br>  1. Use the normal password reset functionality of the website.  This can mean that the site will ask you for some answers to secret questions or that it will email you a new password to your email account.<br>  <br>  2. If 1. doesn't work, contact the admins of the site and explain your problem.  If possible suggest a method where they can be confident that they aren't being conned by you.  For instance, I created my Yahoo account back when you needed to supply an address in the US to get one so I just made one up.  When I couldn't get back in 4 years later, the secret questions they asked me were "What is your ZIP code"... and I couldn't remember what I made up.  I talked to the admins and suggested that they reset the password and send it to the secondary email account.  They were happy that I couldn't con them that way and so I got access back to my Yahoo account.<br>  <br>  3. If 1. and 2. don't work, you may just need to chalk this one up to experience.  You have (hopefully) learned a valuable lesson about keeping track of your passwords online and you will know to be more careful in the future.  Make a new account and start again from scratch.<br>  <br>  4. If you can't live with 3. then your best bet is to try and find the guy who took your account in the first place.  Maybe you can find out his password or the answers to his secret questions.  Maybe you can get on his wireless network and grab his email as it comes in with the new password.  Maybe you can just ask him and he will be tired of the game by now and will just give it back to you.  Remember though, if you do something illegal or immoral to get your account back, that doesn't make it OK.  Two wrongs still don't make it right.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Not smart asking this in a open forum you'll probally be banned.,|`|XppFZhChaa	its not possible for people like us to hack,<br>  as far as i know, You must be familiar to Linus world, the operating system, rest you know when you 'expor' that world man<br>  linux and redhat ^|`|d6WMmjn7aa	I think you mean Crack son.

SJM0rzHtaa	Not a stupid question at all, because Microsoft's licensing policies are especially confusing, and in the case of OEM versions, draconian.<br>  <br>  If your copy of XP or Vista (assuming you are using Microshaft) is a retail version, it should be transferrable to different computers.<br>  <br>  If your copy of Windows XP or Vista is an OEM or preinstalled version on the old computer, it is non-transferrable.  Put it onto a new motherboard and it will not re-activate.  When I bought my Dell I paid for that copy of Windows, and I can't understand why I'm not allowed to use it on a new machine when I upgrade.<br>  <br>  Crap like this makes me reluctant to spend any more money on Microsoft operating systems, which is why I have just one licensed copy of Vista on my main machine and the rest of the machines such as my media server on my home network are running Linux Ubuntu.<br>  <br>  And no, you cannot transfer your Dell's windows to another computer.

aj5IBTuXaa	Each core in a dual or quad machine is a CPU that can execute an instruction thread.  Multi-core = multi-thread.  So at first glance you would say that should be faster, right?  And it is, but there are other factors to consider.<br>  <br>  For instance, memory.  There is only one memory and one memory bus (usually), so every core is in competition with other cores to get something from the memory bus when that core wants to fetch or store data.  Manufacturers offset this by making the L1 and L2 (level 1 and level 2) caches larger.  These caches make memory access faster when you are looking at an area you have recently referenced.  It will still be in the cache.<br>  <br>  Offsetting this competition, some instructions require multiple CPU cycles to execute.  A 2.66 GHz processor doesn't execute 2.66 billion instructions per second.  It executes 2.66 billion instruction STEPS per second.  If any core's current step happens to not require a memory action, that core is not competing for memory.<br>  <br>  You have the same considerations for disk and video access.  While having multiple cores makes the machine faster for doing many things at once, there are offsetting factors that make a dual core box less than 2 times as fast as the single-core box of the same speed.|`|YVE64dJUaa	Dual core means that two physical processors are present<br>  <br>  Quad core means that four physical processors are present<br>  <br>  It doesn't equate to better speed just that more data can be handled at any one time<br>  <br>  Think of it as a road<br>  <br>  If you have a road that has a speed limit of 50MPH and is a single lane then only single file traffic can travel along that road at any time which could result in a tailback if the demand on the road gets high<br>  <br>  If its a dual carriageway then during times of excessive traffic the traffic can be split between the roads resulting is less load on either road and better handling of the situation<br>  <br>  If it is a four lane motorway then the traffic is further able to be spread out resulting in even fewer traffic issues<br>  <br>  So with a quad core processor it is much more equipped to multi tasking and dealing with high demand programs, a dual core processor is still a good choice but if the use of your computer is high demand applications then the quad core processor will help<br>  <br>  If you are planning on games for computer then the processor is a major consideration but also remember the RAM and Graphics as in most cases if the Graphics is on board and the RAM is fairly low (less than 2GB) then gaming suffers on a vista computer|`|0XVLsJTLaa	Ok,<br>  <br>  the quad core at 2.66GHz is double the speed because its like 4 times 2.66 and the dual core is 2 times 2.66.<br>  <br>  with the quad core ur getting 10.64GHz all together and with the dual core ur getting 5.32.<br>  <br>  i happen to have the intel core 2 quad Q9400 running at 2.66Ghz and its very good and very impressive.<br>  <br>  so i would go for the quad core.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!!!|`|UhroMfoWaa	Get the dual core you will never see any difference.

zorYTX59aa	Unfortunately for you, any music that's not your creation and that is<br>  used in your video is considered "copyright infringement". The huge<br>  music/media corporations like UMG, Warner and Viacom don't just<br>  "own their music", they "own the rights" to them, which means how<br>  and where "their music" can be publicly presented.<br>  <br>  Thus, they're apparently 100% within their rights to claim the music <br>  in your video as their own -- especially if you have not paid them for <br>  "licensing fees", "distribution rights", "royalties", and/or "expressed <br>  written permission" to use and "broadcast" their music on YouTube.<br>  <br>  If you did use their music, that is considered part of the often-heard<br>  warning: "Unauthorized duplication, reproduction, retransmission or <br>  redistribution -- whether in whole or in part -- without the expressed <br>  written consent of [insert company name here] is strictly prohibited.<br>  All rights reserved. ? " Their concern isn't just you but other people <br>  who could conceivably download, copy, or just listen to their music<br>  "free and on-demand" without ever having purchased it -- nevermind<br>  that you might be tarnishing their image.<br>  <br>  If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the <br>  same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,<br>  description or tags. Also, avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright <br>  infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any <br>  credit for this song". Not only do YouTube's upload servers look out<br>  for song titles, artists' names and sentences like those, you're also <br>  stating that you have knowingly taken, used, copied or maybe even <br>  stolen someone else's copyrighted material.<br>  <br>  You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry <br>  is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within<br>  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such, <br>  it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your <br>  video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".<br>  You'd thus be better off trying to find a different version of the music <br>  you want to use. If you have seen other videos apparently using the <br>  exact same music, those videos were probably up on YouTube just<br>  before this new technology really started coming into being.<br>  <br>  The only possible exception to everything that I just wrote is for you <br>  to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds in length. If you listen <br>  carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play<br>  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a <br>  guest or going into/out of commercials.

hc8U4Jbhaa	I think you do have a right and and a responsibility, do it in a light  chatty sort of way . I can remember myself thinking I knew it all (as the young often do),but looking back I made lots of bad decisions and wonder why my parents allowed some of them.It was because they thought i was sensible and and trustworthy I was for a child but was of course lacking in the wisdom that only age brings.<br>  Trust your instincts you know best and you are obviously caring|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Much better to ask her if she can let you watch her on it. If she is prepared to allow this, there is a good opportunity to find out more about each other, and make it obvious that she can come to you if she has doubts about anything. This will also promote trust later when she gets to a really worrying age.|`|g62ATenqaa	Yes, I think as a parent you are right and sensible to be concerned and should already have set up parental controls so that certain sites should not be accessible to children. As is always said, children should not have computers in their bedrooms where you cannot always see what they are doing, but in a main room. I know children hate this because they like their privacy and of course have to do homework on a computer sometimes, but safety comes first.|`|MxculX2Daa	I think that is completely reasonable.<br>  <br>  I have 3 children who are now all young adults but we have had the internet in our home since the eariest days of the web.

Mom, I don't know of any reasonable way to do this that doesn't trigger trust issues.<br>  <br>  Is it wrong?  In isolation, I would have to say that it betrays a lack of trust.  In that case, it might not be the best possible move.  Do you suspect her of doing something online that she shouldn't be doing?  At some point, you have to decide whether she has crossed a line.  If she has not obviously done so, then I don't think there exists a good, black or white answer to your question.|`|4AMJ0uV8aa	I think if you explain your reasons to her then it should be fine. Its not a matter that you do not trust your child, but I certainly would not trust strangers on the internet with my child.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	will you be able to get it?  Yes go ahead but make sure she doesnn't find out though|`|7k2c7Xajaa	yes you could try to ask for her password but make sure to tell her your reasons.<br>  <br>  however i suggest that instead of requesting her password you could just watch her while she is on habbo and let her explain to you what she is doing and stuff. that way you are informed about what she is doing while online while also showing her that you are interested in her stuff and not merely sort of intruding in her privacy and asking her password.<br>  <br>  if you think that she is talking to people who you wouldn't like her to talk to than you should of course ask for her password.<br>  <br>  hope this helps you out.|`|5apGkgS9aa	yes it is i have two daughters 12 and 22  the eldest at uni ...you have every right to see what she is doing on pc i wouldnt read my daughters diary ..but the internet is different..and im 42 and i had sex at 12 yrs and thts before the internet nothing to do with trust take yourselves back also im not encouringing under age sex but i was sexually mature for my age so you have to be careful|`|Mb7PP53Xaa	no you are not wrong to do that, my daughter is 10 and i will know her passwords until she is 16, you are responsible for her welfare she is your child its simply looking out for her|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Do it.

If she was 13 or 14 I would say leave well alone - but 11 is still very young.<br>  <br>  I think it's only too right for you to know who her friends are and who she's associating with, and that includes her online friends as well as offline ones. If you can't do that without knowing her password, then it's fair and appropriate for you to ask her for it.<br>  <br>  As long as you can reassure her that you're just doing it to protect her, and that you won't pry into her private conversations (any more than you would read her diaries for example) other than to know who she's talking to, then I'm sure it will be fine.|`|kK7Gxc6maa	Of course you want to look out for her welfare, but you are invading her privacy, even though you say you are not trying to.  In my experience of bringing up two daughters you must respect their privacy if you want them to be open with you.  Talk to her about the dangers of the Internet. Share your worries with her and ask her who she talks to.  But if you try to control her life and pry secretly you will end up creating barriers with yourself, and make the situation worse.  Give children freedom and respect within boundaries, and they will come back to you.|`|r0Fho3CIaa	11 is young.  Personally I think too young to be able to know always when not to give too much information away.  But every child is different.  Maybe rather than demanding first for her password, ask her gingerly who her friends are and ask who she speaks too...but ina  way like you're interested, not like you wanna stop her.  <br>  <br>  Normally I would say everybody deserves their privacy...but young children are particularly vulnerable so, I don't think its unreasonable to ask for her password....however getting it may not prove as easy....|`|gtcQ8l5laa	I see absolutely nothing wrong with it, you're just looking out for her.|`|1adEgwLYaa	it depends on how much u trust her, and how responsible she is, at 11, its probably ok, im 13 and i dont like people looking at my stuff

SYm2y1hUaa	They are delicious!  And they are also small text files stored on your computer from browsing the internet.  Certain sites will require you to have cookies enabled.  There are different uses for them.  Some keep track of what you've done on their site, like what you've added to your "shopping cart" on a shopping website.  Some can help personalized webpages load faster.  Some are tracking cookies, watching your browsing habits for many different reasons... mainly to send you spam email or popups related to what you were looking for.  These cookies can only communicate with the website from which you downloaded them from.  Third party cookies, however, are basically advertising on other webpages that you go to, and communicate through a "3rd party" website (not their own site).  <br>  <br>  As you can probably guess, the tracking cookies tend to be bad for your computer, and your privacy.  Cookies are downloaded without you doing anything other than visiting a website.  You can disable them in your internet settings, but like i said earlier, some sites require you to have cookies enabled, so unless you are really concerned with your privacy, I wouldn't recommend this.  You can download spyware/adware scanners for free that will usually find all tracking cookies and remove them for you.  A couple I would recommend are Spybot, or Ad-Aware.  Both have free versions available at www.download.com|`|UDuljXcraa	cookies r the information that an internet page keeps...like if u r doing a form ou something and the comp dies, for ex. if the cookies r ativated it will be easy to do again because the site keeps that...but I usually don't like cus it's easy to someone else get this information...|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	A cookie is another word for your Va-Jay-Jay :)|`|IrecDEAeaa	FIrst, let me start out by explaining how the term cookies came about.  When you are browsing the net, sites often store temporary information on your computer through your web browser.  This information can be thought of as "cookies."  Your computer can be thought of as a "jar."  So, by these sites storing information on your computer, they are placing cookies in your jar.<br>  <br>  Now, cookies can be both good and bad.  They store information such as your browsing patterns, I.D.s and passwords, and other information related to your individual style of browsing.  These can all be great for your browsing experience because they provide you with convenience.  For example, one use of cookies is for your internet shopping.  Most internet shopping sites such as Amazon store cookies on your computer.  If you are in the middle of shopping and have already added items to your cart and have to suddenly close out of the site or you lose connection, your items will still be there the next time you log on.<br>  <br>  On the downside of things, cookies store sensitive information that you might not want stored on your computer.  If someone manages to hack into your system (this is pretty rare, especially if you have good security), they will have access to this information.  Another problem is sites that store malicious cookies.  These are called "tracking" cookies because they track and report your activity to whomever placed it on your system.  This is where the term "spyware" comes from.  Companies use these to bombard you with spam and advertisements for their products.  Spyware is not exclusive to cookies so do not think you are protected just by disabling cookies.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, every web browser gives you plenty of options when it comes to handling cookies and other private data.  Just go into your browser's options and look for privacy or security.  There should be options for how you want to handle cookies.  I have mine set to delete when I close out of my browser.  Some browsers give you the option of having it warn you when a site is attempting to place a cookie on your system, but this can get quite bothersome.  You can also just manually delete them when you feel necessary.  <br>  <br>  Extra note:  If you are worried about spyware, you can download free programs that clean them off of your system.  Here are some great free programs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lavasoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoft.com/</a> (there is a free version)<br>  <a href="http://www.glaryutilities.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.glaryutilities.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a><br>  <br>  These programs do have limitations, but for the most part they are great.  AVG and Glary do much more than just remove spyware.  I personally only use AVG and Glary.  I used to use Ad-aware, but I found the other two were sufficient.  Plus they back-up your system in-case they delete a false-positive.  Hope this helps!

T7Apky52aa	Well you could try something like Crackerjack but since you're only dealing with numbers why not just use a spreadsheet and do it in columns of 500. You can just use a simple formula such as cell A2 = A1+1 and copy this down and across. <br>  <br>  That way you generate all your numbers.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|1PNPlCX2aa	My tip since if I understand you correctly you are just dealing with numbers is to use a program like microsoft excel and then type in the numbers. But it should be easier if you think about the numbers 0001-9999 with the 2 numbers you know infront and behind of every number: #0001#, #0002#, #0003#...... #9997#, #9998#, #9999# and lets hope you dont have a limit of 3 tries or something like that, Good luck.

That is where the rub may occur. If you exceed the number you are allowed to install, it will not be able to automatically activate the software. However, it should give you a phone number to call. Call that number and explain what you are doing. If it sounds reasonable, they will give you a manual way to activate it.

uJBnZWtcaa	Much thanks for all the useful information in your question.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the Microsoft Knowledge Base re installing Office 2003 and 2007 and Error Message 1311:<br>  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/818234" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/818234</a><br>  <br>  It seems that there might be a couple of reasons why you're having trouble installing Office on the second computer.  I'm no tech whiz but it seems like Office 2007 will only install on an XP machine if it has sp1 installed and that it also has problems installing on computers that have earlier versions of Office on them. (Read the last 2 bullets under "Cause".)<br>  <br>  There are a couple of workarounds (the last 3 bullets under "Workaround" - and you've already done "retry".).  Good Luck.
dfjIBHe3aa	I don't suggest you use Linux.  I do suggest you practice safe computing, but Linux, while it has a lot more for people like you, is essentially a development environment.  That is one reason it is on so many types of computers.  Maddog Hall once bought some twenty dollar discontinued piece of hardware -- he ported it to.  That's what Linux users do.  It had Compiz Fusion for five years before Windows got Aero -- reportedly Windows got the idea from the spread of Compiz Fusion -- so yes even our cancers will arrive on your desktop occasionally (no I do not like Compiz Fusion OR Aero in fact I don't know which I dislike more though I think it's a PLUS that Aero requires so much more hardware).<br>  <br>  I do like Linux, a lot, but I code, I come from a family of engineers and I have a good fine arts background -- which means I try to look at computers and what I can do with them with as few preconceptions as possible.  Linux is free as in freedom, not free as in beer.  If you don't pay in money you will be paying in taking responsibility for your computer in a way you would never have considered before.  Once you begin, then you appreciate the freedom of choices and RESENT the preconceptions about how you are going to use your computer that proprietary vendors like Microsoft and Apple supply you with.<br>  <br>  You are a good candidate to STAY with Windows, and I do not mean that as a putdown.  Doom and Quake III Arena are two games it is SO easy to play on Linux -- but it's not worth even dual booting for it.  Just enjoy what you've got.|`|YESUhp8gaa	If you get one of those newbie linux OS like ubuntu, you do not need any codes what so ever, unless you actually want to do some programming.<br>  <br>  They do have programs that will act like your familiar programs and some that are clones for those older games you mentions. Linux is not that good of a gaming platform, because not as many games are made for it. Although you can get some games to work through WINE such as WoW, spore, and etc. Although not every game is going to work through WINE.<br>  <br>  I use Ubuntu Linux and windows. I mainly use windows for gaming and some windows-only applications, anything else I use ubuntu Linux because Linux is faster and more secure.|`|6dtAmXcAaa	Linux can't play many of your games, and steam, itunes, cod4, quake 3, crysis won't work on it. Those are windows only. Linux is a good operating system to use for programmers and people who wan't the ability to customize their operating system and not have useless pre-installed software. It runs faster and very more stable than windows is. There are many verisons of linux such as mint, ubuntu, damnsmalllinux, ext. The versions are based on what can be done on them. Stick with XP if you only want an operating system that can play games and you don't know any programming or coding. <br>  I use linux for music, internet, programming, running servers, ext. because of the ability to customize it.|`|AedgDfOAaa	The first issue is you dont seem to understand what Windows and Linux are. Windows is an Operating System, Linux is a kernel used in operating systems.  GNU/Linux is the kernel with the GNU user-land utilities.  Most OS's people call 'Linux' are variants of this with other variances in their design and implementation of the OS(how packages are handled for instance). With Windows and  GNU/Linux OS's most things are not done the same way. They are not the same operating system, and a program wrote and compiled for one will not run on the other.  For the most part, you will have to use different software, not better, not worse, but different.  <br>  <br>  Their are also many versions of 'Linux' (  or better yet, many Operating systems using the Linux kernel) .  Their are hand holding ones like Ubuntu, Suse etc.  Their are also really simple ones like Arch Linux. ( My Operating System).  They all have different ideas  behind their creation so make sure if you do use Linux, get the right distro.  www.distrowatch.com tracks all of them.<br>  <br>  If you are fine with windows, that's good too, use what you want.  For a lot of people, myself included, not only is a Linux distro my preferred choice OS because of how it operates, it is also because of the Free and Open Source nature of the project.

WvDFx4Elaa	wow. thats an open question! you should read wikipedia on that.<br>  <br>  but basically, a graphics card is nothing but a very specialised processor. when a processor can handle 1-4 simultaneous 'streams' of calculations, it cannot handle more than that. <br>  <br>  for gaming, each scene has millions of calculations that need to be done in order to render the image you see. a processor can do this but it will take it a very long time. A graphics card is specifically adapted to this by having many many more stream processors so that it can handle multiple stream simultaneously. for instance to render 1 frame in a game, the graphics card can perform hundreds of calculation at the same time for each screen. <br>  <br>  this isnt a very technical description... wikipedia should be more verbose.

I suggest you keep it low maybe not so much maybe 1 once every week like when he isnt around (which might take awhile ;-) ) So just when you feel you can tell him you have been!! <br>  Oh and if you find he is like cheating on you print it out or whatever and show it to him and your maybe his parents!|`|RFo1lLXPaa	that depends. if he has a clean record, and has always been faithful to you than yes that is very wrong. and you would be considered a snoop. but if he has been unfaithful to you; like cheating, lying, and so on; than yes you have a right to get the truthful facts. I hope you make the right decision. for your sake. because if he finds out, than your gonna be in trouble.<br>  good luck.|`|W5LI8ti2aa	Okayy thats kinda creepy.<br>  <br>  and also yeah it's horriblie wrong.<br>  <br>  If u have not found anything yet then you wont find anything! just deal!<br>  <br>  <br>  and if u tink hes cheater or soemthing so creep around thats ****** crazy So yeahh just deal or get over it.<br>  <br>  and talk to him!<br>  <br>  and u need more trust soo yeahh.... peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dada?|`|DC64wxBeaa	What you think if he went through your handbag? Most girls I know wouldn't like that.  So how would you think he would feel, even though he is your boyfriend he should have his privacy (so should you lol).  If you suspect he is looking at something he is not meant to, then ok.  But spying on him, behind his back not really good thing either.  You give the impression that you don't trust him|`|48SlX2Yiaa	That's wrong. If he is your boyfriend, you should trust him (if your motive for doing this is because you're suspicious). <br>  <br>  Also, its not good to be nosey. You wouldn't want people doing it do you, regardless who owns the computer.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	That is wrong on so many levels ... First of all if you feel you have to do this with a boyfriend..why would you still be with him?  If you can't trust him ...You must have extremely low self esteem issues!!!  or He must be a real jerk ...either way break up with him and seek therapy|`|vxqDQDNCaa	I think maybe you should lay off a little bit. It's cool that you're so attached to your boyfriend. If I had one and he used my computer, I would do that too!|`|TTvvVRcBaa	Must be no Trust in the relationship, you need trust to make it work.<br>  <br>  Talk to him, Tell him your insecure about things im sure he will put your mind at ease.|`|13bff504802cbac1fdf217a1da67dd50aa	Be careful looking into things like that you may see something you regret.|`|v3ncANM5aa	There is no relationship if there is no trust.|`|vu8JNSI0aa	thats seriously strange|`|PgwnPJVJaa	yes and it is ILLEGAL.|`|odN7xCpzaa	I think it's wrong to a degree. It is your computer, after all. All of you would probably do the same thing if you had the oppurtunity. But, obviously your doing it because you don't trust him. To have a healthy relationship you need to trust your companian.|`|svkqrsjIaa	I really have no opinion without knowing both of you. If he has been unfaithful before, than it is definitely not wrong, but if he has never been unfaithful, than it is kind invading privacy. Then yet, he probably wouldn't be doing anything bad on YOUR computer.|`|AA10486344	noooo thats cool as, he probably does it to you to.... you most likely both stalk each other on a regular basis.. awwww  love is so sweet.. i think the trust in your relationship is sure to have you two together for life. Sounds like the perfect relationship.<br>  Maybe you should steal his underwear and keep them in your draw to! LOL!|`|SdmwrVpbaa	Yes it is wrong. How do you do that.|`|gC6Yyq3qaa	Yes, it is wrong. Would you want someone doing that to you?|`|MovN0TvWaa	TRUSSSSSSSST ISSSUEEESSS<br>  <br>  think about it.|`|dILqe7nBaa	yes it is wrong <br>  why are you so insecure??|`|SFai2Eb9aa	umm kiiindd of. you should be able to trust him completely<br>  girlfriend that is so wrng and an invasion of privacy<br>  looks like you need to work on your trust issues|`|kQA7SbY9aa	If you feel you have to monitor what he's doing on your computer or anywhere, you shouldn't be with him. You don't trust him and if he finds out, it could very well mean the end of your relationship. If you're concerned about something he may have done, confront him about it.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  Where should I go? If you don't like REAL/HONEST answers, you shouldn't ask the question. <br>  <br>  I think BOTH of you are wrong: Him for starting it and you for feeling you must do it to him in retaliation; and I'll say it again: if you don't trust him, you shouldn't be with him. And leaving is an option, just like the option you've chosen, to stay. I hope you both can get past whatever led both of you to lose trust in each other because if you continue on this path, you know that things will fall apart. In all seriousness, maybe you need to consider couples counseling.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	Yes it is. If you don't trust him tell him about that, it won't hurt him if he really cares about him. If he's honest with you and finds out you've been monitoring his activities you'll hurt him real bad and your relationship will be damaged forever.<br>  <br>  In that case, your not wrong, but why do you both want all this headache, break up already, you're not meant to be together. Why  isn't that an option?!|`|lkxFy681aa	If I were him, I'd leave you instantly.<br>  <br>  <br>  What right do you have to invade his privacy?|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	And if you found out he was having you fallowed by a privet detective, every day for the last 2 months. Making a list of every where you went, every thing you did & every person you spoke to... How mad would you be..?? All because you were using his car...|`|RaV7SidDaa	man you have trust issues|`|Yn7JMTKxaa	yes its wrong.but your computer? if its yours and hes doing all that crap to you why do you let him use it to disrespect you.if he did what you say he did to you then he sounds like a jerk.|`|YfJHliLWaa	Yes I think it is wrong.  Although it is your computer, it is his privacy.  If you suspect he is cheating, etc. you should talk to him.|`|WMXPzMQJaa	Yea, uhm that's not weird at all? Really what do you expect us to say? That's a total invasion of privacy and straight up creepy.|`|Xi8LpZC0aa	You need help with your insecurity,he wont be your boyfriend long if he finds out what you are doing why dont you trust him!|`|Vzzc6mATaa	If you feel that you can not trust him then he is the wrong guy for you|`|tk4PLUvnaa	Not if it's your computer. Why, what did you find?|`|5rn8OzwAaa	thats a complete violation of privacy

jSq4ZO1uaa	Do you really intend to pass such an expensive and complicated process? You should know your site would be unavailable whenever your PC is turned off, and you're leaving yourself open to attacks. So I recommend get a reliable company to do that in return for a few dollars.<br>  <br>  As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.<br>  <br>  If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together.

AA10587211	It could be a number of things. My guesses would be, overheating, a short somewhere or some other hardware failure.|`|3GmG8uQzaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III. Computer Restarts After Download?<br>  <br>  This can also be a virus or spyware problem. I suggest you go through your Control Panel / Add or Remove Programs list and remove any programs you don't need, then run thorough anti-virus and anti-spyware scans.

You can easily stop the restart problem by changing your system <br>  features to restrict automatic startup when your computer's having a problem.

Thereâs a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> â click on the âTroubleshootingâ link.  Hereâs my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youâll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger â a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy â a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware â for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note â it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youâve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or youâre not sure if youâre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select âSafe Modeâ and repeat the scans once youâre connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

HBAMQJPLaa	VISTA is probably the best OS Microsoft has put out to date.<br>  <br>  It runs great, fast and simple to learn if comming from XP.<br>  <br>  Most crybabies about VISTA nevr tried it at all.<br>  <br>  They just want to sound knowlegable because they heard cousin Brucie who is computer inept say it was no good so they repeat what dummy Cousin Brucie said.<br>  <br>  Or they cry because their 1995 laptop or desktop won't run it very well.  If you buy  a new computer today all teh hardware is compatible with VISTA and much is not supported by XP.<br>  <br>  Just get at least 3 gb memory...it is cheap anyway today.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Yes. don't get it|`|dILqe7nBaa	nothing is wrong with vista except the people that can't take the time to get used to it vista is far better than xp and windows7 will be better than vista<br>  and with the new computers now you can't use xp and if you do it will void the warranty|`|Xwc9iF0Zaa	Vista SUCKS.

2vL8wOHZaa	Yes, That power supply will fit that case. I hope that you aren't going to be using that on a gaming computer with a high end video card. I know it is a good price for that many watts, But go with a Name brand power supply. You will thank yourself later. Spend a little more and buy a Quality power supply. Go to newegg and look at the ratings and compare. I recommend Antec and Thermaltake. I hope this helped.|`|6kC9me0baa	yes<br>  <br>  If you notice, they're both labelled as ATX, that's it's 'form factor' since they're both ATX, they'll work together.
HBAMQJPLaa	News to me, a Dell user for over 15 years now without ever having a problem with one.<br>  <br>  Most novices complain about any laptop as they are computer illiterate and don't know how to use any laptop.

There are Dell computers that are good and dell computers that are bad. For the most part it comes down to the individual parts that are in the computers. Universally, electronic components are volatile and have to be replaced regularly. But to go anecdotal doesn't answer the question. I'm on a Dell Dimension 2350 that is made of low end components, the motherboard doesn't even have a video card slot on it. It's been running for about 5 years no problem. My friend had some high end XPS gaming machine and it pooped out after a year.<br>  <br>  As a whole however, they're typically sound machines. Make sure you look at the components and specs to what you're buying. Name alone will not guarantee you get what you're looking for. Also don't buy a micro atx (space saving computer), they tend to be less modular and harder to fix when a part goes bad.|`|q7MIcWBBaa	the laptops suck horribly .. took me 7 months on a 1 yr warranty to have them repair my inspiron 1100 under warrany .. they basically rebuilt it and the damn thing still doesn't work .. <br>  <br>  the desktops are good tho .. i've had an 8400 for about 7-8 years and it still runs like new .. only thing i've replaced is the burner in it .. i've had my XPS for 3-4 years and haven't replaced anything on it yet ..|`|kbTSRbI7aa	no it just dell's company produce laptop without operating system in the time like this it makes them weird however the quality of their products not really suck it sounds normal like the other brand like sony hp etc|`|02c0f67aa29e44406bd985f0287467f8aa	No, I have a dell that is about four years old and a compaq that is a year old.

I would strongly suggest against running Windows as the only OS on a Mac as it is a waste of the machine.  I would look into getting a high end Dell that runs Windows.|`|d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	Yes.  Included in the Mac Os is a utility called Boot camp, which makes it easy to make a Windows partition on your drive, creating a machine that can boot into Mac OS or Windows.  Hold down the option key when you power up, then choose.  <br>  <br>   There are also software solutions that will allow you to use Mac and Windows applications at the same time, very convenient if you only need one Windows application. <br>  <br>  To my knowledge, for any of these solutions you will need a fully licensed standalone version of Windows to install, that is, you can't use a restore disk from a machine that had windows pre-installed.|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	probably, but why would you? MAC is so much better!|`|6PBGAp7Raa	yea|`|oS70PnhIaa	Yes you can Install windows OS on your mac laptop.

If it doesn't say anything, has a bunch of garbled stuff, or the memory is a ridiculously small number, then your harddrive is dead, and you will have to takeit somewhere to transfer the data to a new one.

If your computers BIOS is up-to-date enough to boot from a flashdrive, you might be able to run a repair from there.<br>  Another option is take your hard drive out, go install it in another computer that CAN read CDs and run the repair on that computer, then bring it back.<br>  But there really is no magic key combination that can fix a blue-screen without a disk or utility of some sort.

IFtV7g2Zaa	1) Contact an attorney and set up an S corporation.  The attorney can tell you whether you'll need a license in your state/county.  A DBA isn't secure enough.  Make it an S corp or LLC at the least.<br>  2) Contact your state tax office and get your Sales Tax Id<br>  3) Make friends with a good accountant who will tell you want is due and when it is due.  What paperwork you have to file, and when to file it.<br>  4) Get general liability insurance.  It won't cover you if somebody sues you for destroying the data on their computer, but it will if somebody slips and falls on your premises or if you're in a car crash while carrying somebody's computer.<br>  5) Decide what your niche is and how to market your business.<br>  6) Write a business plan.  On second thought, do this first.<br>  7) Prepare to wait 3 to 6 months for the first week of work.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|6Xreht4Qaa	There's new proxies every day on :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pr0xyblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr0xyblog.com</a><br>  <br>  Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)<br>  <br>  Happy Surfing !|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>  ?<br>  <a href="http://isgreat.info/2a/" rel="nofollow">http://isgreat.info/2a/</a><br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|jE41oKZIaa	Try these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://surfbros.info" rel="nofollow">http://surfbros.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://webvisa.info" rel="nofollow">http://webvisa.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://netrover.info" rel="nofollow">http://netrover.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://proximize.me" rel="nofollow">https://proximize.me</a>|`|zElPWULJaa	try<br>  <br>  postern[dot]info (Brand New)<br>  <br>  freer[dot]info<br>  3158[dot]info<br>  5888[dot]info<br>  6677[dot]info<br>  lovewebproxy[dot]com<br>  <br>  replace [dot] with a "."|`|PoJETtibaa	Try <a href="http://www.speedproxy.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedproxy.co.uk</a> :).|`|zNZW8RMraa	|+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  |New Brand Working 100% Web PRoXIES Just EnteR ::::::::::::<br>  |<br>  |here it is a few easily proxy WebSites You can Use ::<br>  |<br>  | <a href="http://www.247Web.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.247Web.co.cc</a><br>  |<br>  | <a href="http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc</a><br>  |<br>  | <a href="http://www.xunblocker.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.xunblocker.co.cc</a><br>  |<br>  | <a href="http://www.2surfall.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.2surfall.co.cc</a><br>  |<br>  |Be Sure to tell your friends or post them to your myspace page or blog so others can enjoy.<br>  |<br>  | Happy Surfing!<br>  |+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...

BChKHLRXaa	To achieve any sort of artificial intelligence that even resembles a conversation would take quite a bit of coding. Doing it in a batch file would take even more than that. Batch files have their place and can do lots of cool stuff, but to parse the english language would be nearly impossible.  If you want to tinker with it, the best way to retrieve input from the user would probably be the set command:<br>  <br>  set /p response="How are you doing today? "<br>  <br>  This would display the prompt: How are you doing today? It then accepts input from the user, which is saved as a string as the variable "response"<br>  <br>  You can parse the input by using the for function: <a href="http://www.ss64.com/nt/for.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ss64.com/nt/for.html</a> and the findstr function: <a href="http://www.ss64.com/nt/findstr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ss64.com/nt/findstr.html</a><br>  You can use if statements: <a href="http://www.ss64.com/nt/if.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ss64.com/nt/if.html</a> combined with other commands such as the goto function: <a href="http://www.ss64.com/nt/goto.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ss64.com/nt/goto.html</a> to give varying feedback based on different responses.<br>  <br>  You can find out all sorts of info on how to use the functions in dos on the site I provided, or lots of other sites.

KRTPJP2baa	The process is called 'Normalisation'. In full there are 5 steps to this process but the first produces the most useful results - All repeating groups should be moved to their own tables. Here however it is difficult to say exactly what you should do as normally you need to know what the system is supposed to answer and in practical systems this often determines how the data is structured i.e. actual systems are a compromise and very rarely the theoretical ideal. Google 'Normalisation of data' to get practical examples.<br>  <br>  Edit: Based on the other answers so far it is not as simple as is being suggested. As one example an Accomplice in one or more offenses could also be the main offender with some other accomplice(s) in one or more other offenses. Under these circumstances the 'person' table should include both the main offender and the accomplice with appropriate links to all their crimes. This is what I meant by saying you need to know what the system is supposed to answer before deciding on exactly how to structure the data.|`|aab8fee4bb00a3a37d38643f4e296de7aa	Person_tbl:<br>  Person_ID<br>  Surname<br>  Forename<br>  gender<br>  <br>  Trial_tbl:<br>  Trial_ID<br>  trial_month<br>  trial_year<br>  <br>  Person_Accomplice_tbl:<br>  Person_Accomplice_ID<br>  Person_ID<br>  Accomplice_ID<br>  <br>  Charge_TBL<br>  Charge_ID<br>  Charge/crime<br>  trial_ID<br>  Verdict<br>  Sentence<br>  <br>  Anything that says ID is a primary or forgein key.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	A person table for the gender, forename and surname with a primary key numeric id (always best) which under mysql would be :<br>  id int(6) auto_increment<br>  Then a crime table for offences again with a numeric id<br>  A verdict table (a list of possible verdicts with ID)<br>  A punishment table similar.<br>  Then a table to combine all the ids to link the person.id to the crime.id, verdict.id, punishment.id and another person.id as the accomplice<br>  This should include the date as one field. From this it is possible to generate any type of report you want<br>  You might want the gender to be a simple boolean, but I prefer to use a simple int(1) field with the alternatives being 0 and 1. For this use not such an important difference. In other cases it can present limitations to use boolean. I have had cases where a table had been designed to use boolean for valid and invalid availability (obsolete / current) for something, and then there was a call for something to be identifiable as invalid from different actions in the database. Changing this field to numeric allowed for multiple invalids, each identifying the actual source of the invalidity. This in turn meant the whole system could automate changes to re-validate the item, except for the 0 case which was still obsolete with no remedy.

HPnmh25Faa	I don't know of any list-hygiene companies however I wouldn't bother with them even if I did.<br>  <br>  List hygiene is not something you can do once and forget about it.  Email addresses go dark from time to time, sometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently.<br>  <br>  You should have your email sending application track the status of each email address in the list every time you send a message to the list.  Email servers can reply with a range of responses when you try to send an email to an email address on that server.  These responses include:<br>  <br>  This address doesn't exist.<br>  This address no longer exists.<br>  This address has a full mailbox.<br>  We have a temporary problem and can't receive your mail.<br>  You have exceeded our message receiving rate.<br>  You are on a blacklist.<br>  <br>  There are many more possible messages and good bulk mail software should be able to deal with all of them.<br>  <br>  In addition to this, sometimes the messages come back as an email to the FROM: address, or the REPLY-TO: address.  These messages can be out-of-office auto-responses, mailbox full messages or even unsubscribe requests.  Your bulk mail software should be able to deal with many of these as well.<br>  <br>  As for the first time you use the list, you can check the first sort of response I mention above without actually sending a message by bailing out of the connection to the mail server after you know that the address is real but before you send the message.  This might be handy to do before the first time you use the list to cut down on the bounce messages you get.
2LZbzvY3aa	I type really fast and my bf was always crazy over that and wanted to be able to type like me so I taught him.  Now he is same typing speed as me, never looking at fingers.<br>  <br>  It's like anything, there's no fast and easy way, it just takes practice.  Learn each letter at a time.  <br>  <br>  First learn how to position your fingers properly.  This is easy to do actually because you will notice that the letters F and J on an English keyboard have a little raised out indention on the letter.  This is because you put an index finger on each of these keys.  Open a word document and start out by learning each letter, and then trying words.  <br>  <br>  I consider the "problem keys" for most people are up on the top row to the right (U I O and P ) and on the bottom row to the left ( Z X C V and B ).  Probably just because these letters aren't as commonly used.  So worry about those later.  Think of common words.<br>  <br>  Try simple phrases as first like "i enjoy computers" or "i want to type".  Type this many many many times.  A hundred times.  Then try other phrases.  You will begin to see which keys you struggle the most with<br>  <br>  When I learned to type the thing that I did that helped me dramatically was I  memorized the order of the keys in my head.  If you haven't done this yet you will see it turns out quite easy to begin with because the top row begins Q W E R T Y.  Qwerty.  Pretty easy.  Memorize them all.  Believe it or not, you will begin to associate certain pheonetic sounds with the three rows of keys.  For example, if I am thinking of the word Zebra, and I associate a "row" to that, it will always be the bottom row because of the Z and B and those are the most "noticeable" letters in that word.<br>  <br>  Anyone can learn typing this way.  Believe me.  IN a few weeks you will be able to type properly.  It is just frustrating that's all.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OYOYJktkaa	Learn where to place your fingers. Repetition. Just type type type type. And then repeat.|`|vUsVieulaa	I more or less taught myself to type, and now I can do 80 wpm. I never used any sort of typing tutor program -- I just typed as much as I could.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind: always type with proper punctuation and grammar, especially in IMs. IMing someone is good typing practice, but ONLY if you type right (u no not lik dis cuz dis not gona make ur typin speed betr)|`|hQ070UmLaa	Probably the best way would be to learn by doing. Start writing documents more, and surfing the web more.

Ohxue95Jaa	i do not know but good luck|`|NZxvybYUaa	Sounds like a power supply problem. Does it do anything when you try to turn it on? Fans, any noise at all? If not, check the back of the computer to see if there is a reset button near the power cord. And make sure the cord is plugged in, and there is power to it. If there's no external reset button, remove the case cover and look carefully at the power supply (the box the power cord plugs into) and see if there is a fuse (usually looks like a round black knob, you turn it 1\4 turn and pull out to check the fuse). If there's mo fuse, the power supply probably needs replaced. It's not very expensive ($30-50). Here's an example: <a href="http://computerpartsusa.com/details.php?ID=641" rel="nofollow">http://computerpartsusa.com/details.php?...</a> <br>  You can change it yourself , just make sure you plug all the connectors back in just like the old ones were.|`|aIYc3idgaa	i dont understand, please be more detailed.|`|rRHqAn3Aaa	if the computer wont even turn on, its most likely a power supply problem.  First try checking all the connections inside the computer (or have someone who knows a lot about computers do that) because if it's just a loose cable, plugging it back in will fix it.  But likely you will need a new power supply.|`|c096A36oaa	email me at mr.stevens69 yahoo

zorYTX59aa	DON'T WORRY. I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT GET COPYRIGHTED, <br>  BECAUSE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO UPLOAD <br>  PROBABLY ISN'T EVEN YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.<br>  <br>  "Copyright" means that you "created" and own" each component of <br>  the video -- including the composing/writing, arranging, producing &<br>  performing of the music.<br>  <br>  If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the <br>  same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,<br>  description or tags. Also, avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright <br>  infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any <br>  credit for this song". Not only do YouTube's upload servers look out<br>  for song titles, artists' names and sentences like those, you're also <br>  stating that you have knowingly taken, used, copied or maybe even <br>  stolen someone else's copyrighted material.<br>  <br>  You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry <br>  is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within<br>  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such, <br>  it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your <br>  video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".<br>  You'd thus be better off trying to find a different version of the music <br>  you want to use. If you have seen other videos apparently using the <br>  exact same music, those videos were probably up on YouTube just<br>  before this new technology really started coming into being.<br>  <br>  The only possible exception to everything that I just wrote is for you <br>  to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds in length. If you listen <br>  carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play<br>  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a <br>  guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?<br>  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)<br>  <br>  I hope my info has been helpful to you. Here is the official viewpoint<br>  from YouTube itself about "copyrights".

G+ or G+MIMO would be my choice until N is finalized.|`|wGKiQmWdaa	All of those routers are going to the same job for most situations. If I had to chose one myself Id probably go with the <br>  <br>  Belkin - Wireless-G Plus MIMO Router<br>  Model: F5D92304 | SKU: 7241068<br>  <br>  The two main differences between wireless G and N is the speed and range of the signal. Like I said before for most cases the range of a wireless G router is more than enough for most people. Especially when you factor in that they are cheaper. As far as the speed between G and N. In less you are doing alot of file transfers from computer to computer on your network that won't effect you either. When I say that you internet connection is only going to go as fast as your modem not your wireless speed. So Id go with the router above.|`|ec2Lhkbwaa	definatly NETGEAR - RangeMax 802.11g Wireless Router great quick connection and can have mutiple computers and game consoles on there

dkpIjt5jaa	This is nothing like a laptop, this is a Netbook !<br>  <br>  Netbooks are very good for Internet BROWSING not so much for playing online. They are not that good for MS Office ( screen size, cramped keyboard ). They are the "pits" (not that good at all) for iTunes and similar multimedia apps as they are not built for it.<br>  <br>  ALL the consumer-level Netbooks* have NO internal CD/DVD drives and the following MAXIMUM memory limits:<br>  Linux based: 512 MBs<br>  XP based: 1 GB (some RARE exceptions have 1.5 GBs)<br>  <br>  * There are newer so-called high-end Netbooks that come with more but they are generally pricier than laptops.<br>  <br>  Hard drives models average 80 GBs ( some have 160 GBs )<br>  <br>  Other models use SSD** (Solid State Drive) with no moving parts ( good when you move a lot as they are more "solid" (pun intended) ) but these are smaller in GBs and higher in cost.<br>  <br>  ** This is "similar" to the way USB memory stick work.<br>  <br>  You should get a affordable (not cheap) "Laptop" not a "Netbook" (you CAN get a few good ones at prices that would make a Netbook blush). The best way to find these is by doing research.<br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking some models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your research.|`|b1nsvu7xaa	Yes Dell is a good brand.

nWgtperhaa	first off, these are not gaming rigs, but neither are they $2000+. that being said, they are both good computers for basic usage and an ultra-low price tag.<br>  <br>  now, i would say the acer at tigerdirect is much better for four key reasons.<br>  1. faster processor- dual core amd vs single core. you will notice much faster speeds by getting the dual core<br>  2. bigger hard drive- 320 vs 160- most likely, you won't fill either of those up, unless you do video work, but that extra space is nice to have, just in case.<br>  3. better graphics- nvidia 8200 vs 6150se- both are integrated, which will slow performance, but the 8200 will top the 6150 anyday. <br>  4. cheaper- everyone likes to save a buck when they can, and this is a perfect chance to do so. the acer is cheaper, and it has better stats. best of both worlds<br>  <br>  <br>  note: i just noticed that the acer is refurbished, i did not take that into account when i started this review. however, i would still go for the acer despite that. it has much better hardware, and being refurbished is not that bad. if it was a laptop, it might be different, due to old batteries, etc. but this desktop should be fine.<br>  <br>  hope this can be of assistance.|`|Dz9dwqq5aa	The acer from Tiger has better specs, but it is second hand. I would not advise buying it!<br>  <br>  The Walmart PC in not worth the money. The CPU is too slow and would not run games very well.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt advise buying any of them.|`|dGDvJ5Voaa	They are both perfect computers for what you want to do. And they are at an incredible price aswell - i which they sold for that cheap over her in the UK.<br>  <br>  But back to your question. I think the first computer is more appropriate for what you're going to do as it has a better number of interfaces and a better processor.<br>  <br>  It also has a greater ability to be upgraded even further - something i would certainly consider in say a year or so.<br>  <br>  The only thing i would say is that at the moment, XP is s much better operating system and Microsoft have announced will continue longer than Vista. So be carefull and keep an eye on the new Windows Seven Operating system soon to be released.|`|2KuToOthaa	The Acer from TigerDirect is a better computer and will be better for your occasional Halo play.<br>  <br>  Your general rule of thumb is that a computer capable of decent gaming performance will always be more than sufficient for your general office tasks such as word processing and internet browsing.<br>  <br>  The Acer has a gaming grade graphics card, 2GB of memory, and a decent processor.  The other one does not list any specifications.|`|Kfr8AQ4Qaa	you should get a computer specialist. that could meet your needs before deciding to buy. not talk sales just to sell some.|`|8ec7e3cbbcacf0843865206e98565509aa	If your just Playing Halo, I think you would be OK, then I would recommend the ACER. BUT, if your taste grows and newer games start to turn you on, I would re-think what your buying now and consider something for the long haul. <br>  New games now require the obvious-Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 /<br>  AMD Phenom X3 8450, then a Good Graphics card Like any of the Radeon ATI 4800 series or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 1GB. Finally to get all that going your going to need a 550 Power supply Unit. <br>  +Plus+ if you buy a Propietary computer Like E-Machines or Dell make sure you get a Bulky Desktop machine so you have adequate space inside so there is good air flow and the new hardware can fit inside.<br>  <br>  But those are the three things you'll need for all the new games coming out, and any Propietary Computer you buy will have enough Memory or Storage.

Y0zwVG1Xaa	Depends on how you look at it. To purchase a computer for checking e-mail and browsing a few websites they are relatively cheap. Unless you consider a cell phone can do the same and is cheaper yet. Also a cell phone gets replaced every two years and usually for free if you go with verizon and a good plan. The Dell has to be replaced every three years and at your own expense. If you get a Dell that can play games they are really expensive. Also the parts in those $5,000 machines are worthless at best. For around $800 you can build that same system. Also consider that a cell phone company has corporate offices in most bigger cities where you can take your phone to get fixed if you have issues. Dell you have to talk to some idiot in India who doesn't speak English very well and is reading from a script. He tells you to format the hard drive and reinstall windows as a first step to troubleshooting. You can get an English speaking person from Dell, but they have the nerve to charge you a monthly fee for that little convenience. Your last option is to take it to the Geek Squad who will tell you that an easily fixed computer is not fixable and you will need a new one. Oh and then charge you $200 dollars for that information.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No very reasonable|`|AA10265922	go www.dell.com<br>  you can find all kinds,sure you would find one you like|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Competitively priced.  <br>  <br>  All name-brands are pretty much the same.

They do not even show up on a wireless card equipped computers list of networks in range, much less being able to steal their bandwidth with an antenna.  You would have to have a card and a service contract.<br>  <br>  If you want internet, you have to pay for it, gain access from a place that allows you to use their bandwidth like motels/campgrounds, or, steal it from someone who doesn't know how to secure their network.  An antenna will allow you to steal a signal from farther away,if you have a wireless card that can use one.  Most people have learned to secure their networks by now.  Through Qwest mine was secured automatically.<br>  <br>  There are devises that can steal cell phone signals and thus a real expert might be able to gain access that way.   They are expensive, or require skill to make, and are often illegal to use.

M7i30zP6aa	Q: I try to play Shaiya, but my computer keeps restarting. Any suggestions?<br>  <br>  A: When any program repeatedly shuts down your computer, chances are youâre running Windows XP and Windows is encountering a conflict. In Windows XP, the default setting is for the computer to reboot automatically when a fatal error occurs. (Pretty useless if you're trying to troubleshoot, isnât it?)<br>  <br>  To change the recovery settings and disable automatic rebooting: <br>  1. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties. <br>  2. Click the Advanced tab. <br>  3. Under Startup and Recovery, click Settings to open the Startup and Recovery dialog box. <br>  4. Clear the Automatically restart check box, and click OK the necessary number of times. <br>  5. Restart your computer for the settings to take effect. <br>  <br>  Now when a fatal error occurs, you'll at least see it and it won't cause an automatic reboot. You still have to sort out what's causing the problem, but at least youâll have a starting point.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The answer above is for XP, but Vista has a similar setting as well.  It has nothing to do with the firewall, and UAC, but rather some conflict with windows.  Here's a few things that comes in my mind:<br>  <br>  1) Installed in the default directory?<br>  2) Does he have the AV suite, ie, AV and firewall and spam blocker all the extra stuff?<br>  3) Any program in the background running other than Shaiya?  Check that from the task manager.<br>  4) Try run it in the Windows XP compatible mode?<br>  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.

I guess you can convince her that you won't make friends with people who make you uncomfortable, and reassure her that nothing bad would happen to you and that you won't suicide like the people do when they have it. Maybe do something convincing argument that she would trust you with it. Make her trust you with it! Hope this helps! (Please don't take this personally)

Fast Memory Access.<br>  <br>  <br>  So YES, it is worth the xtra 100 bucks !<br>  <br>  Even if you don't entirely need it now, the gaming industry is NOT standing still and pretty soon, you will need all the help you can get from your system as games will become MORE demanding on hardware.<br>  <br>  Is peace of mind for the near future worth 100 bucks ?

iW0q8MUlaa	Hi.<br>  People have given a lot of confusing answers here, all are correct but I hope to explain it a little easier.<br>  <br>  Ok. Open your "My Documents" folder. In there should be a folder called "My Received Files", double click on that. Then in there should be another folder, this time names the same email address you use to log into MSN with, double click on that. In there are all your Chat Logs, you can view them by double clicking them and they shall normally open in an Internet browser, default, Internet Explorer, so you can read them.<br>  <br>  If you have installed MSN Plus, which is a free application you can download off the internet. It saves a SECOND copy of your chat logs, so MSN Messenger saves the chat logs as I have explained above, but the MSN Plus application saves a second copy. These can be found in your "My Documents" folder under, "My Chat Logs". If you cannot see the "My Chat Logs" folder, then you do not have the MSN Plus application installed. If you have nothing in the "My Recieved Files" then MSN Messenger hasnt been configured to save your Chat Logs.<br>  <br>  Hopes this helps, any more questions, feel free to email!|`|OO1UqRVoaa	well most of the time your conversation gets saved in the documents folder<br>  they should be in your received files. normaly the folder would be named as your id on msn. but who knows. but im pretty sure they in your documents... best answer?|`|7JDuae2Laa	The conversations are saved only if you have "messenger plus". If you have it you should have a file called "my conversations" in your documents (files), click it and there they are! Hope I helped!|`|qKKrjKOuaa	if you have the new msn messenger - windows live messenger then it is saved in a folder called 'My Chat Logs'..which is located in the My Documents folder..<br>  <br>  :)..hows that for a best answer xD..<br>  good luck
iW0q8MUlaa	Hi.<br>  I would actually reccomend that you purchase an external hard drive. It is exactly the same as a memory stick as in that it plugs into a USB port but it can hold a lot more as it is, infact a hard drive instead of a "chip" which is what a memory stick is.<br>  <br>  external hard drives can be picked up from almost any computer store/retailer. The companies that I would reccomend would be either Freecom, Seagate or Western Digital. Never buy Maxator as they have a reputation for not lasting very long!<br>  <br>  If you looking to store photo's I would suggest you get a 500GB external hard drive. This will keep you going for a very very very long time! And I doubt you would ever fill it up, but the space is there, saving you keep purchasing hard drive after hard drive like soo many people do. <br>  <br>  In answer to your second question. Yes if you do purchase either a memory stick or an external hard-drive, you can delete the photo's from you "My Pictures" folder, but just make sure they are ALL on the memory stick or hard-drive first so that you dont loose any!! As that has happened to me before!<br>  <br>  So yes, your best of purchasing a 500GB external USB hard drive either made by Freecom, Seagate or Western Digital and yes you can delete the photos from the "My Pictures" folder ones they have been copied over.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CDPHgHGcaa	if you select all the photos you want to put on a mem stick you should see somewhere details of how much mb (megabytes) they are taking up. you can now get a mem stick from most electrical shops at the right size to fit all your photos onto. if you wanted to you could essentially delete the photos off your Computer but that would mean NEVER loose the mem stick or you loose all your photos.|`|JCecAhJiaa	memory stick don't work that much<br>  try a usb drive works better you can connect it to <br>  any pc or anithing most of the usb drive you <br>  can buy them at pharmacy or anything......<br>  try a 3g it might store anything you want it depends on how<br>  much things you want to store..........|`|Tqk7qTRoaa	You could have a browse for a a 4gb/8mb/16mb mem stick on <a href="http://www.everythinglink.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythinglink.com</a>|`|924e4zDNaa	Just buy the biggest memory you can afford,they all work well and can all be used much like any other detatchable memory,and fit easily in your pocket ,unlike cds.once you have one you will find you use it for much more than storing pictures."Have stick will Travel" reads the card of a man.|`|629gDYzkaa	Okay I'm not sure why it's taken 9 answers to get what you want but I'm going to make it simple. Yes you can download all your photo's from My Pictures onto your memory stick and then yes you can delete them all afterwards to free up some space on the computer!<br>  However, I will agree with one other comment that if you're planning to delete all your photo's I'd make a second backup onto a CD or DVD, more reliable!<br>  I say you can copy all your photo's, this does of course depend how many you have! Here is a couple of links to 4gb and 8gb from Amazon and PC World respectively for a dirt cheap price, hope you find what you want!<br>  <br>  Chris|`|nDNV3eboaa	Well Know a Days The Flash Drives Are Really Cheap.  <br>  You Can get a 4gb for about $35 or so.<br>  <br>  All the flash drives Let you put stuff on them and delete if after to free up memory. <br>  <br>  IF you Just want to Store pichtures on your Then 1GB should be a lot of memory for you.<br>  <br>  for other things try to get a bigger memory stick like 2GB or 4GB.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps.|`|SYm2y1hUaa	If you're looking for storage to get things off of your computer, you could get an external hard drive.  They plug into an open USB port on your computer and you can store ALOT of data on them.  You can probably find a 320GB one for around $80-$100 nowadays.  Might be more reliable than a flash drive.|`|XpJFIUCpaa	Right click the folder and chose the bottom item on the menu which appears and single click it and the window that pops up will tell the size of the folder; from that you should have some idea what the size of storage it needs to be.<br>  FYI:<br>  CD holds 700MB, DVD 4.3GB (single layer) double layer 8.2GB|`|13bff504802cbac1fdf217a1da67dd50aa	I would burn them to a CD/DVD for permanent storage.  I have noticed Flash drives are unreliable for backups.
qCzd5ekvaa	Actually no there isn't. You could try taking the copy of his Vista disc and installing Vista to your pc but then it would ask for the PIN number. If you were to use the disc, you'd end up using the same PIN on two computers which then Microsoft would be at your door in a heartbeat with the feds... unless you keep your computer not hooked up to the internet.
QOLPOdK9aa	Ram uses the same amount of energy either way.<br>  The only thing changing is the state of the millions of transistors that hold the value of the binary data being stored (1 transistor state "on", 0 transistor state off) Ram is being provided constant voltage to hold these values. When you power your pc off all the data stored in ram gone. If you have too little ram your pc may use more power as it's constantly having to spin the platters on your hard drive. There is an area of storage on you hard disk called a page file in windows or a swap file in linux. This area acts as "virtual ram" and as your memory fills up, data not being used at that moment is written to that area. An example would be you have photoshop and excel open. You stop working in photoshop and start working in excel, the photoshop data get's moved from Ram over to your page file. You stop working in excel and go back to photoshop, the data for the picture you wee working on before you started excel gets moved back into ram and continue working. The more ram you have the more applications you can have open without reading/writing data to the page file. So in summary, if RAM is full all the time your hard disk spins more and uses more power.|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	Hmm... I would say more when full... but not by much... and only if you mean like a hard disk. <br>  <br>  If you mean memory as in RAM... then I don't think it makes a difference, cause it is getting a constant voltage. However writing to it takes energy. <br>  <br>  If you don't mean RAM, then I would say there would be decreased performance, which results in longer seek times... resulting in having to move the reader more.<br>  <br>  Really, it is a trivial amount of energy though. At least... it seems like it would be.

It means a floating point number with 2 decimal points.  You can even add the dollar sign:<br>  <br>  "...$&.2f  "<br>  <br>  +add<br>  Link's answer is clever!|`|LqXyM8lFaa	Assuming that the variable salary is a double the following code would truncate it to two decimal places.<br>  <br>  //pre-condition: double salary is initialized to some value<br>  <br>  salary*=100;<br>  salary = (int) salary;<br>  salary/=100;<br>  <br>  //done<br>  <br>  First you multiply by 100 so that the first two decimal places aren't lost when you cast to an int. Then you can divide by 100 again to get back those two decimal places.

The 400GB drive is not even that big by today's standards - your going to want the space! Don't skimp on this purchase only if your wanting to save $100 or so. You'll be spending that much more and sooner if you need to upgrade the cheaper one someday.

Keep in mind, many websites block users who use alternate methods (like VPN) to connect to the internet.<br>  <br>  Second, clear your browser's cache.  If you're not logging in, it could be a cookie that's on your computer that they activate when you return to their site.  Clearing your cookie cache would eliminate this.<br>  <br>  Further, if you installed software on your computer to use their site, then clearing your cache and/or changing your IP address won't let you back in.  Move on, they don't want you, there are plenty of other places to see.
SAvpk6Isaa	You can call the maker company of the laptop and if you have any serial numbers or activated/registered the computer under your name or your parents then they can give you the IP address maybe then you can use tracking software to track the IP address and send viruses ETC. to stop the thief from using it any further. But I am not sure police will help with this, it's not their responsibility to find stolen stuff, unless it was tooken straight out of your home due to a burglary.

YqFKUPW3aa	There are a few problems.  First, you need quotes around your number.  That's less important, because since $start is outside of PHP scope, it's being parsed just like regular HTML, which doesn't recognize $start, of course.  There are a number of ways to do this.<br>  <br>  1) Add PHP scope around your variable: <br>  <br>  <fb:time t="<?= $start ?>" tz="America/New_York" /><br>  <br>  2) Extend your overall scope to include the HTML code, but output it through PHP:<br>  <br>  <?php<br>  $start = 23434;<br>  <br>  echo "<fb:time t=\"$start\" tz=\"America/New_York\" />";<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  echo '<fb:time t="'.$start.'" tz="America/New_York" />';<br>  ?><br>  <br>  This is pretty simple PHP knowledge, so I'm under assumption you don't know PHP very well.  I'd suggest that trying to make a Facebook app is not the best way to learn.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>                 all these cards are good performers and have good and bad points however when looking for a new graphic card you should look at several specs,these include core and memory clock speeds,memory bus interface and memory bandwidth,and then theres the direct x version and pixel and shader model compliance,taking these into consideration we shall look for the best of the above cards<br>            first we shall look at the core clock and use 500mhz as a required speed,and since all these cards have 550mhz  and above core clock speeds we then look at the memory clock speeds<br>           the 8500gt and the 9400gt have inferior memory clock speed(800mhz) when compared to the others so we shall ditch these as non-starters<br>             so we are left with the 9600gso,8800gs and the 8600gt,so we now concentrate on the shader processes which signify how well the card can work under load,the more processes also called "cores" and the better the card will perform and the higher the frame rates in todays games<br>               the 9600gso has 128 and the 8800gs has 128 aswell were as the 8600gt has just 32 so we shall ditch the 8600gt because of this<br>             so this leaves us with the 9600gs and 8800gs,now the core clock and memory clock speeds are pretty similar (1600mhz memory clock and 550mhz core clock in both cards)<br>            and both cards have the same 192bit memory bus interfaces which gives them both the exact same 38.4gb/sec memory bandwidth,so which is better ?<br>             well i would personally go with the 8800gs,and not for any particular reason since both the cards have exactly the same specifications even down to the texture fill rate,and this is rare<br>             and since both cards have 384mb of gddr3 memory we cant even choose between the memory <br>            so i suppose we could choose the cheapest card,and also the one with the best cooling,well i still would go with the 8800gs<br>             any problems let me know<br>                   good luck mate !|`|7KkRkseUaa	the 8800GS i guess, but if you can manage an extra tenner i'd go for this 8800GT. its a much better card than any of the others, 57gb/s, 112 stream processors, (the GSO actually only has 96) 700mhz core etc. its pretty much exactly the same as the 9800GT in fact and was the mid range champ for over a year.|`|cZwxEH6kaa	If you shop from Newegg.com, you may be able to find a 9600gt for around the price you are wanting.

You are able to access your router, so that is working ok, but you cannot connect to the internet.<br>  <br>  You will need to check the physical connections between your router and your telephone line (assuming you have an ADSL connection) to ensure that you have a good connection and the correct coloured lights are lit on your router..<br>  <br>  Before I can offer any further detailed advice it would help if I knew who your is your ISP.  Most (not all) reputable ISP documentation for a basic setup is quite clear and it is usually a good idea to configure your network using a wired (ethernet) connection between your laptop and your router.

So I think you are having a hard time because trojan's are not exactly viruses. So most anti-virus programs will not remove them, because they do not see them as viruses.<br>  <br>  A couple of month's back I suffered a nasty trojan infection.  It completely screwed my computer up.  Every time I would get on the internet I would get blasted with pop-up after pop-up.<br>  <br>  It got so bad, I thought I would have to get a new computer.  So out of frustration I called Geek Squad.  They wanted $200 to look at my computer, and that didn't include fixing it.  No Way!<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I was searching google for a trojan remover that I came across the solution to my problem.<br>  <br>  I found a website that gave honest reviews of the best spyware removal programs.  So I checked into it, and the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.<br>  <br>  I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer.<br>  <br>  It found all the trojan worms, and spyware infections that none of my other programs could find and delete. <br>  <br>  I have been running AdwareAlert now for the last couple of months, and it has been doing an awesome job at keeping my computer spyware free. <br>  <br>  I never have pop-ups anymore, and my computer is running like a dream.<br>  <br>  You can Visit the website I found in google below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.honestspywarereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestspywarereview.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.

While Macs are pricier your really getting a lot more for your money - the very best hardware and the very best operating system to date. since Apple makes both the hardware and the operating system, the two work together seamlessly.<br>  The learning curve in switching is not as bad as it once was either. Both Windows and Mac OS have enough similarities that you should be happily operating things in no time.<br>  Also, no need to worry about viruses and spyware - the Mac OS is far better positioned to not get any of them (especially since most if not all viruses are Windows specific) Not one real virus EVER in the history of Mac OS X.<br>  <br>  If you have specific Windows applications that don't run under Mac OS X you can even (for the cost of Windows) install and run Windows on the Macintosh too.

I couldn't use my computer for days. I tried everything to get rid of it, but no matter what I did, it just kept coming back stronger. I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck. I gave up and decided to throw in the towel. I called geek squad. They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it. I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time. The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through. Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60. <br>  <br>  He told me to go to  <a href="http://www.honestspywarereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestspywarereview.com</a><br>  <br>  So I checked into it, and found the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.<br>  <br>  I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer.

Everytime I buy a laptop, that's what they recommend.|`|DWbq2Jv8aa	Hey Dude, if you want free security on your laptop i have simple suggestion just deep freeze your system to have a better security from viruses.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Antivirus applications are useless and don't offer protection, because they operate retroactively instead of proactively.<br>  <br>  Think about it. If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  3. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  4. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  5. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  6. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #1 and #2.

If you don't, go to the HP web page and download the proper driver and install.<br>  <br>  Solution, from Dr Geek<br>  After much googling, I discovered there is no true solution on the internet. Seeming this article is at the top of the google list for search "POWER SURGE ON HUB", heres the solution.<br>  <br>  The problem, is you get a message "Power surge on Hub Port", whether it be one device connected (such as a optical mouse) or every port connected. The problem appears out of know where, if this sounds like you, read on...<br>  <br>  Ive tried everything, I've uninstalled the USB entries in device manager, reset my bios, tweaked the usb settings in my bios, vaccumed my usb ports, tried vista, xp and the problem was still there.<br>  <br>  The BAD news . This error is telling you the truth, there is a fault that is causing a power surge in the usb port. This is permanent damage, and is not reversable. For me, I believe I shorted a port because a part of the motherboard aluminium frame at the back on the case came into contact with a tooth within the usb port. The damage is permanent, thats the bad news.<br>  <br>  The GOOD news , is that Windows being the great thing it is, can disable certain devices if their malfunctioning, Under your Ctrl Panel->System->Device Manager, you will have a section at the end called "Universal Serial Bus controllers". For each detected usb port on your computer, you will have a "USB Root Hub" and another item dependant on your board manufacturer. For me, its "Intel(R) 82801FB/FBM USB Universal Host Controller - XXXX". These are the items we want to deal with.<br>  <br>  Firstly, disconnect all usb devices from your PC<br>  <br>  Secondly, using a PS2 keyboard/mouse, right click (Keyboard, press the button to the left of your Right Ctrl) on each "Intel(R) ...." listing under the "Universal Serial Bus controllers" and select disable. Leave the "USB Root Hub" alone. You will see that once you disable each one of these, the "USB Root Hub" disappear anyway. Disable all of these "Intel(R) ...." entries.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, this is a repetitive step, starting from the top, right click and enable a single usb controller. Now use a low powered device like a optical mouse and plug it into a usb port, if it doesn't pickup within 10 seconds, change to the next usb port, until you get it to respond. If none of the ports respond, disable this usb controller again, and repeat this step for the next usb controller in the list.<br>  <br>  With a bit of luck, you will, like me, still have a functional usb port on your computer. I have six in total, two ports don't even provide any power to my optical usb mouse, three fail working after a minute or so, the remaining one seems to be still standing.<br>  <br>  If your unlucky enough not to have any functional USB Ports, or find that you need more ports to retain your sanity, the next best bet is to buy a PCI USB Card and plug it into your mainboard, but be sure to disable the onboard USB via the bios, otherwise you may find it'll interfere with the PCI card's usb ports OR buy a new mainboard, because it has permanent damage.<br>  <br>  Hope this solution finds you happiness... Schitzn (Dr Geek)

Computer techs do have such specialized software as they may be requested to recover lost data. So they usually have the capability, but they are more likely not to be interested in doing so on their own without a valid reason, as they have other things to do.

dkpIjt5jaa	Be sure to calculate enough power when choosing your PSU !<br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic cards), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+30+25 = 524<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm not the one building it so compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 600 Watts and get up to 700 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  Best PSU manufacturers at the moment are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.<br>  <br>  <br>  A 64-bit OS is one that communicates twice as fast as a 32-bit OS and can use more than 4 GBs of RAM, your Windows XP home is a 32-bit OS.<br>  <br>  To get 64-bit, you must have Windows XP Pro 64-bit (which can use 128 GBs of RAM) or any Windows Vista (except the starter edition) which can use from 8 GBs to 128 GBs depending on version as Vista is both a 32-bit and a 64-bit in the same box (It is ONLY limited by the hardware).|`|NJBp6uJkaa	well, they are very difrent games, star craft 2  is a RTS and processor Dependant, it will run default maps, but may have trouble with alot of players or a big map because RTS games love ot eat processor, but the specs are not released yet, so t could even have quad core support =D.  <br>  <br>  the graphics card is a good one, but don't expect very high settings (you should be able to get high), just keep your expectations in check and you are good =D <br>  <br>  -good speed RAM<br>  <br>  decent mobo<br>  <br>  just make sure that you get a 64-bit OS to use those 4 GIGs of RAM<br>  (u didnt post a HD((hard drive)) to critique or a PSU(power supply)))|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	Everything looks good but I don't see a power supply. You will need a 550 watt PSU as that GPU eats 400Watt and the Cpu 95. I have the same card and really like it. I play Crysis, Fallout 3, and Flight sim X on highest settings with no issues. I had no idea Diablo 3 was coming out. It's about time!!|`|oelMyWSAaa	Hey<br>  <br>  You'll definitely be able to handle SC2 and D3 on max settings without any problems (I'm waiting for those, too!).<br>  <br>  Your video card and CPU are fine which typically matters most in gaming.  4GB of ram is useful as well even though it's not needed.  <br>  <br>  It's nice to see we have some female geeks around :)<br>  -Peter<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey.  The 9800GT is a complete waste of money.  The 9600GT has a higher core clock, and only a slightly slower memory clock.  Definitely not worth it!<br>  <br>  64 is actually 64-Bit.  64-Bit is used when your putting more then 4GB of Ram into your system because 32 bit only addresses 4 gigs, while 64 can address up to 18 I believe. <br>  <br>  I forgot how to check which version (32 or 64) your using in XP as I've upgraded to Vista (Needed Direct X10).  <br>  <br>  It should be in the system information area.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions, feel free to e-mail me at trollness@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  (I'm not a perv so no worries...I'm 15 xD)

So if you are a extreme gamer who plays a different game every day then go with Intel? Core?2 Extreme X9100 3.06GHz (6MB Cache, 1066MHz FSB) and if you play one or two of the same game every week go with Intel? Core?2 Quad Q9100 2.26GHz (12MB Cache, 1066MHz FSB).

2qVzfmsgaa	What is it like? They cover in the ebook information which is available for free in the Google Help pages, so it's like paying for Firefox.<br>  Secondly, when you subscribed, you can't get rid of it. They advertise a very low price on their website(s) then you get charged monthly with a great sum (anywhere between $40 and $99 i heard). You can't call them because the number they provided doesn't work.

IAXhu2tuaa	Here are some good applications designed just for portable drives. You can get your own Firefox browser so they don't know that you've been surfing, because your traces stay with the browser which goes back in your flash drive. They all load and unload from a flash drive as you need them. The portable keyboard is useful so in case they use a "magic lantern" and record your keystrokes. You'll have to use your mouse to use it. Just check the size of each one to make sure it will fit on your drive.

Don't worry about it.

1KQR83CDaa	Amazon is probably one of the safest places on the net to buy. That is why they are one of the biggest retailers in the world. You have no reason to worry.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	I just finished ordering off amazon. I've done it lots of time and never had a problem I've even ordered used books and not gotten ripped off. No one can guarantee you won't have a problem, its just that the chances are small.|`|6dtAmXcAaa	It is from amazon warehouse and from private sellers. The private sellers will have their own username, while if it is amazon you will see the free shipping on over $25 deal on there. The sellers always give you the items tho and it is mainly sellers like bargaincell, target, bestbuy, ext. with an account on there. You will not be riped off.|`|f9484619bfcfb57fe476153f87a360f5aa	You can generally buy specifically from Amazon, the company, and that is very safe - it is essentially like buying it at a regular store, but it is mailed to you.<br>  <br>  However, you can often find items cheaper from other users. You can look at their ratings and what people commented on them and stuff. If you click the used and new copies section you can see the prices and who is selling and see their percent and you can click them to read more.<br>  <br>  However, buying from users is often more expensive because if you buy from amazon (and a very seldom few other users) you can get free shipping (with a $25 or more order). If you are buying used copies from users, you are probably going to have to be paying $2.98 for each CD and like $3.98 for each book and prices like that.<br>  <br>  And, finally, unfortunately, some things that are out of print or something else...can only be bought from individual users. However, users are generally pretty safe to buy from. I haven't had real trouble myself.<br>  <br>  Oh, and about buying from actual Amazon: they have pre-order price guarantee. If you pre-order any part of your order, then they'll charge you that price or any lower price that it gets to before the end of the release date. And you can cancel orders that haven't shipped yet and other stuff like that.

ldJXd0NGaa	I'm guessing that neither the Operating System, nor the boom-box is at fault.  It's quite common for disks burned on any particular CD/DVD burner to play (or not play) in any particular CD player - especially if the CD player is more than 2 or 3 years old.  <br>  For some reason certain players can't read disks burned by certain burners.  <br>  If you are adventurous, switch out the burner, and use the same burner with "both" OS'es - just to see if the disks will play regardless of the OS. I'm betting they will.<br>  Not much you can do about this prob except maybe check the settings in the burner software you are using with Vista:<br>  1. make sure it's set to "finalize" the disk.<br>  2. be sure you are using only CD-R's (not CD-RW)<br>  3. try setting the burn speed a bit slower.<br>  4. If you're not using a 3rd party burning app, try one - like Nero, or Burn4free, or Roxio.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Donk

That's just as good. <br>  <br>  Otherwise though, there's no reason to even bother putting an operating system on the computer. Most people reformat the disk when they buy a computer anyway, so there's no benefit to having an OS preinstalled on it. <br>  <br>  I use gparted to format disks, by the way. <br>  <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://gparted.sourceforge.net</a>

I don't know how these converters work, but if I had to guess, I would guess that they are doing some form of OCR processing on the PDF file.  On the other hand, a PDF must be readable by the printer, so if the printer can read it, so too could a conversion program.<br>  <br>  I had a need for one a few months ago.  It worked VERY well.

8XGVB6XOaa	Things progress.  Both the hardware and the software. What happens often though is that the software is readily available to users (Vista) whereas the hardware for which it was built (x64 and top-end systems) are pretty much expensive and/or unavailable to most users...<br>  What results is a common PC straining to keep up with the OS/software demands. =) not a pretty sight. what you could do though is keep Vista graphics to the minimum and you will find it's pretty much as fast as XP. Better yet, don't get Vista! Wait for the Windows 7!

It stands for Cisco Certified Entry level Technician.  You will learn TCP/IP basics... .IP subnetting.. and touch base With he CISCO IOS (internet operating system) which is the OS in all cisco routers and switches. CCENT is the title you get when pass the ICND (Interconnecting Cisco Networking Device) part 1 test. It is the first part of the two test path to getting the CCNA title, that of which would be a really solid knowledge of CISCO routers and TCP/IP.
