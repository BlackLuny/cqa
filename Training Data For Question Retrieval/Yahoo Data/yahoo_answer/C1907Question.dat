Hi guys,      I desperately need some help, I'm a designer and my back light went in on laptop (Acer 5315, dont get one made of really cheap parts), Ive got quite abit of work to do so I have been using a computer monitor until I can get abit of work clear so I can have the time to get it fixed as I won't be able to use it.

I was working on something last night then knocked out the lead by accident then it just lost its signal and today will only get so far on screen but soon as windows clicks in it loses it signal, BUT it will work on safe mode, I don't get it? its been working fine then it just loses it?      I have a feeling it is something to do with the resolution of colours but why work for weeks then just go like the others? I know it cant be the monitors it has to be something to do with my laptop.      Ive tryed loading my software in safe mode and it just wont have it, haha I know I should know abit about this stuff but im dumb when it comes to ins and outs of the technical stuff.

20090129084908AAbTF92	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why don't HP value their customers?	I bought a HP Tx2540EA tablet notebook, and the screen kept scrambling, and it froze several times in less than 24hours of getting it out of the box. Also the screen remained upside down when switching from tablet mode back to normal laptop mode.      So I returned it to Comet and exchanged it for exactly the same model, and exprienced the same problems as with the first. However, then the keyboard suddenly died.       I desperately want a tablet PC but I could exchange for a third machine since the Tx2540EA are now discontinued. The only next tablet is another ￡200! Why should I pay more?      So I have written to HP, they can't do anything about it, and have just filed my complaint. In light on all my problem I have experienced why couldn't they help with the ￡200 difference, since this is the only option available to me to get a tablet notebook?

I know these few facts:      1. In order to compile code I must enter the following code into the unix terminal:                  gcc directory_of_the_program -o outputname      2. Then I do the following to execute my code:                outputname.out      Enough information?

I installed it properly the 1st time. I tried to play many games that I owned already on the card. The computer is a dell dimension E310. A weak gaming computer. It would give me a blue screen saying NMI memory parity check. I went online and people said to uninstall new drivers. I did this. Now my computer stops after loading windows xp service pack 2. Unless, I get the message where they let me enter safe mode. I do that, and I put the installation disc in my computer, I install drivers but it doesnt change anything because when i restart, i get a message saying please wait. I waited 5 hours and nothing happened. I got this card to game. I ahven't been able to do that. Now I have a computer without good graphics, sound, and is slow as ****. I can get online fine. I purchased this card from tigerdirect.

Go to accessories and right-click on the command prompt, then select run as administrator (now the dos prompt is being operated in the administrator mode.      2. type the command and check to verify that the administrator is not active on your machine        " net user Administrator " then click on enter this will display the user account and let u know administrator is not active.      3. To activate the administrator on the machine run the following line in the same Dos prompt window which is being run as administrator          " net user Administrator /active:yes"       this command then activates the administrator account for any user assigned as administrator plus u get the Administrator account itself without a password.      4. Restart your machine and the administrator is activated and u will find your yahoo messenger on the screen other than that you can now install your messenger without any hitch .         Thank you and ENJOY  the vista world once again , its a free world u know.

Me and my parents are moving into a house that was previously owned by a electrician. I found it very interesting because there are ethernet plugs built into the war for plugging 2 ethernet cable into the wall in every single room and even the living room!      However, I have no idea on how to setup my dsl ethernet connection by using the advantage of these wall plugs.   (I have basic experience connecting modem => to router => to computers/ wireless..)    There is no way to find out with the previous owner now, because they moved away.   I have no idea where this should start, if I connected my modem to the router.. how do I determine where I should plug from my router to the wall to share connection to all other rooms??      Very confusing.. please help

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b.

I've been thinking about buying a laptop for a while, but the problem is that my budget is rather tight. I don't really mind about memory or hard-drive space, since I intend to buy an external hard-drive anyway (mind you, I'm not really an expert on computers myself).    I recently found a laptop for $449, but I was a little skeptical about the brand. It doesn't look like it's particularly horrible, but I'm still hesitant. Would anyone recommend this particular brand, or are there any other suggestions?     Here is a link to the product page:  http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddet...    Thanks a lot! ^_^

When I reboot the router by pressing the button, this computer gets a connection (the other one still doesn't). (the other computer has connected to it before, before I forgot the password). In any case, no matter what I do, neither Intel nor wi-fi on the other computer recognize signals from this router.       All I want is for the other computer to get an internet connection, to create my own username for the router, and to secure it with my own key.
20090129095139AAaTDrZ	Computers & Internet;Security	I was hacked before on Answers, how do I prevent it again?	A few months ago, I used Yahoo! Answers to ask a few questions, and found it was really cool, so answered some too.  Then my Answers account was hacked;  first they just changed my username and avatar around, but then the hacker started posting Answers that were one or two words long then had links to adult websites on them.  I spent a frantic several week period logging in multiple times a day to delete bad Answers, and got many, many TOS violation emails.  Every single one I sent back with an impassioned plea for Yahoo! to locate and deal with the person hacking my account.  All pleas were ignored;  the folks answering my emails simply said the content was indeed in violation of TOS and I'd better be careful or my account would be suspended.  They totally ignored the problem and not one ever offered recourse or assistance.  I changed my password many, many times - more in a three week period than I've ever changed a password on any account anywhere - but still the hacker continued to access my account and post violating content.  The final straw, in my opinion, was when the account was suspended - note, this meant I myself no longer had access! - and the hacker STILL was able to log in on a suspended account and post violating content.  I kept getting TOS violation notices even after the account had been suspended!  How weird is that.      So now our ISP has chosen to partner with Yahoo! such that our email accounts are linked to a Yahoo! login.  I am very concerned now about security;  I really don't want to go through that again, and I cannot divorce my long-standing primary email account from the Yahoo! system in order to gain some protection.  Does any Answerer have suggestions on how to prevent my account from being hacked again?

20090129115358AAg1kvL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Computer keeps bluescreening. Just replaced RAM but thats not helping?	Hey,      My laptop recently stopped working. Whenever I used intense programs or games, after a while I would get a bluescreen with various different errors. Never the same one each time.      I thought this was caused by the RAM, so I bought a new 2gb stick (previously had a 1gb and a 2gb installed)      If I run the laptop with only the new 2gb stick, it eventually freezes instantly without warning.      If I run the new 2gb stick alongside my old 2gb stick, it works for a while, but then I get the bluescreen with games again.      If I run the new 2gb stick alongside my old 1gb stick, it won't boot and tells me various system files could not be loaded.      I tried to install windows from my recovery disc with just the new 2gb stick, but it stops loading files about a quarter of the way through.      This is very irritating as I can't find a combination that works!      Does anyone have any tips?      Thanks,   Tom

20090129114206AACANjk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Is PC gaming, GPU or CPU bound?	Assuming one plays games at high resolution and all graphical effects maxed (most people I think), is the fps GPU bound or CPU bound.  Let's say your running a GTX 280.  Will you get higher fps switching from a 3.0GHz QuadCore to a 5.0GHz QuadCore (No I'm not OC'ing; it's just question)?  Let's say you run a 3.0 Quad and then you buy the GT-XK Uber 390 DX11.5c card.

20090129111833AAZlUcZ	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Do you think "Facebook stalking" is just as dangerous as someone stalking in person?	It seems like Facebook stalking is becoming a real problem.  I have a friend who drives me nuts - her boyfriend dumped her for another girl about 8 months ago.  She constantly stalks him and her on Facebook, and even put the Facebook application on her iPhone.  Every time we get together, she has to show me the latest pictures of them together, what they've done, comments they've posted, etc.  I tell her every time that I'm not interested in seeing it, that she needs to stay off their facebook pages, and basically that she needs to get over it.        It hasn't stopped.  I feel like she's even stalking me sometimes - she'll call all upset after seeing something on my facebook page and jumping to some crazy conclusion.        I feel like I should have a talk with her.  I feel like she's really unbalanced right now, and it's starting to worry me.  I want to tell her that if she knew that info from real life, she would be labeled a stalker.  I don't see much difference between "real" stalking and facebook stalking.      So what do you think?  Is this a real problem that I should talk to her about?  Or is it harmless "e-spying" on people?

Uninstalled it and reinstalled it like it said but still wouldn't work!! :@      Any help appreciated :D   Thanks,   Jake

In main function, define two variables of type int, two variables of type float and two objects of type String. Now call the add() function three times for these different data types.      Note: String is a user-defined data type and for this you have to define a class named String. When template function will be called to add two objects of type String then it must concatenate two strings.         Your output should look like this:    Sample Output:    Enter two integer values to be added  Enter First value: 12  Enter Second value: 25    Enter two float values to be added  Enter First value: 13.5  Enter Second value: 14.2    Enter two Strings to be added  Enter First value: Virtual  Enter Second value: University    Addition of two variables of different data types  Sum of values of type int = 37  Sum of values of type float = 27.7  Sum of values of type String = VirtualUniversity

The user is required to enter the loan principal then selects from 3 separate loans in a combo box.  Once they are done, they click calculate.        In my actionPerformed method I have something along the lines of:   If (source == calculate)  \\ calculate is the button   {        if (selection == 0)  \\meaning this is loan type one from the combo box        {   \\ calculate loan one's method        }        else if (selection == 1)  \\ selection for loan 2 from the combobox        {  \\ calc loan 2's method        }        else if (selection == 2) \\ selection for loan 3 from the combobox        { \\calc loan 3's method        }   etc.      Here's my dilemma.  I need to be able to create a text file (done) and somehow have my program read the interest rates from that file to use for each loan's calculations.  But I keep confusing myself on how to do this because I am still not quite understanding it.        I have read lots of help documents on java, and everything talks about the different components of the method to read the file, but I have yet to find something that explains how to create the method and how to tell my program to "take line 0 and use that for loan 1's interest rate. Take line 1 for 2's, take line 2 for 3's"      So, any help would be realllly appreciated.        P.S.  Please don't tell me to go to the Java help forums....been there done that.

I know this is isn't suppose to be a big deal, but I left my iTouch in my locker at school, and it's turned on with internet turned on. Like by tomorrow the battery is gonna be all worn out which means next time I charge the battery, it's gonna run out faster because iTouch's battery is made out of nickel or something and I'm not suppose to use it all the way to keep the electrons moving.       So, my question is, does iTouch shut off the internet automatically if the internet is not in use?

I am going to learn Javascript to supplement my programming in Visual Basic and C++, and would like to know a free program to start with, like Bloodshed Dev C++, only for Javascript instead of C++.      I already have a book, so don't bother with telling me what book to order.      I currently have Microsoft Visual Basic Express, but I'm not sure how in-depth it will let you go with Javascript. If everyone says that's the best one, I'll go with it. If not, I would like to know the name of the program I need and a link to download it if possible.      No free trials, please.      Thank you for your time and patience, and good luck!

Just as I was about to shut down my computer last night, this message pops up saying a virus was found and I needed to update my computer. It kept trying to get me to download something called Anti-virus 2009 with an installation box. Every time I'd click cancel the same box would reappear. I was able to run my own virus and anti-spyware program, but it didn't show up until I went in and checked my virus log and there it was. It looks like my own program quarantined it, but it also said it took no action. I went to my anti-virus web site and it really doesn't give a solution or explain how to avoid it in the future. Can anyone tell me how I may have gotten this virus and how to make sure it is no longer on my computer. FYI -- I don't visit many sites that I don't trust. It is usually the same ones everyday and I haven't a problem like this before. I appreciate any help.

20090128112332AAcXnQu	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	I'm looking for a budget graphics card...?	What I want is something as cheap as possible that will play half decent games. It needs to be at least 64mb shader capable (not quite sure what that means?) and ideally have at least 256mb ram.      I'm edging towards a nVidia or ATI car but I'm really not sure what to get.      By cheap I'm talking <￡50, I don't mind shopping around on eBay or possibly buying second hand though.      The sort of game I want to be able to play is something around the level of 'Fable - The Lost Chapters' and it doesn't even have to be on the best settings. So no major gaming here just something cheap.      Although being able to play Call of Duty 4 would be nice but I don't think it's gonna happen for that price.      Cheers, James.

I've used 3 different programs (Webroot, Spyware Doctor, and my usual virus program), and after clearing several things off, they claim the system is clean. But it's still slow, and occasionally Spyware Doctor is blocking stuff, even when the browser isn't running.  How can I fix this?  Do I just keep buying more and more antispyware, antivirus and antiadware programs until something seems to work?!  I'm going broke, and they're probably slowing the system down more.

I am a GNU/Linux user and definitely fascinated by the GTK+ and QT libraries and the option to write my own programs.but ,I lack the basics with a weak mathematics skill and yet to learn C or C++ for the foundation.   Many ,in the opinion that ,if I learn C before C++ ,C++ with its Object Oriented Programming style cannot be easy for me and I must end up unlearning C programming.   --   Also ,I am using GCC(GNU COMPILER COLLECTION) for compiling and remember in your answer that this guy dont use Window$ for almost a decade and will never use in future too.So ,no Visual basic ide or some Borland compiler crap as answer.   Thanks.

My problem is that I don't have a choice in viewing it. If I wanted to, fine, I have the web at my disposal to view that kind of thing. But when I sign onto myspace I don't want to see that. I feel annoyed because it's being forced in my face. It's a "look at my body, I'm easy" type picture. I've expressed being irritated by it in the past and it doesn't go down well (she acts the innocent). I also installed an image blocker, but it blocks other images (such as my own) also, and I also use several computers + mobile phone to get on.      If I delete her, it causes personal offense. I did that in the past and it wasn't pretty. The only way out is not to use myspace.      Any other suggestions?

20090128101058AAhf6Yx	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What programming languages would be ideal to learn in the situation described below:?	If I was trying to set up a network of monitors that received information from two sources, which would be the best programming language to learn?       The first source would be most likely my own system of updating the monitors, most likely a server on a wireless network. Keep in mind that I would have to update these monitors (monitors is a loose term, basically any electric device that can create a visual display) from several miles away possibly.      The second source would be an external center that updates another product continuously. I can't go into detail here, but once the other product is updated from the external source, my product would need to be updated.      Let me explain a bit about my programming background. I have basic knowledge of VB 6.0 and novice knowledge of C++ (If statements, some loops, very novice). Learning isn't a problem, as it has to be done, but relevance is. I know that some languages just aren't cut out for networking, which is what the main focus of the product is; updating a visual display through a network connection.      Thank you for all detailed and supported replies. Additionally, if you ar really adept at network programming, please contact me at jack.skellow@ymail.com. I would really like to flesh out the question here with you so that I understand completely.      Thanks and have a good day!

20090128114438AAKGCSp	Computers & Internet;Software	Is it possible to transfer all user files from one hard drive to another?	When I bought my laptop, the drive isn't partitioned - all together in Drive C. Months later, somebody opened up to me the need to have a partition so that if the other one becomes infected with viruses, the other one will not be affected. After gathering some information on how to create a partition, I decided to make Drive D. My plan is to retain all program files in C while all user files (My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, My Videos, etc.) will be transferred in Drive D. I have no idea whether it is possible. Please give me a step by step procedure if it is possible.   P.S. I don't want to read some answers like "you just have to copy all those files and paste in the new drive". That won't answer my problem. To add:In the current, if I am going to save a Word Document, it is saved in My Documents which is located in C.I want that when I'm saving documents, the default should save it to D.  I don't know how I can do that.      God bless!   Thank you!

When I turn it on, all there is, is jsut a bright green screen with light green bars going through it, and then after a little while the green will just shade and it will turn off. It does not respond to any buttons that I press, however if i hold down the two buttons to reset it, it will just turn off. When I go to turn it back on it comes back to the same green screen.

20090128115838AAzBeOP	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Is this illegal??? Help!?	Hey,      I am a web developer, and have a client with a request for a website.  For some reason, the idea of this site sounds like it might violate paypal or credit card companies policies - and might even be considered fraud.  Then again I could also be wrong.  Please take a look at the below website description, and tell me if this is a project worth taking on, or turning down.  If you think this is not legal/ethical, please try and send me a quote or something from paypal or wherever so I have solid proof that this is no good.      Basically, the idea is this:       1. A customer needs money to pay a debt (i.e. rent, car payment, parents, etc.) but doesn't have enough in their account.       2. They provide my client with a credit card.       3. My Client, in turn, charges the card (plus percentage for utilizing PayPal)       4. Once transaction is clear, My Client transfers the money into the customer's account (or sends them a check OR sends a check directly to the customer's payee).       Basically, it's a cash advance without paying the credit card company's high fees.       Transaction is complete. They transfer they money from PayPal to My Clients Business Account.
