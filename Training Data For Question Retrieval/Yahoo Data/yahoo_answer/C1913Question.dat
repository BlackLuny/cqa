20080724173050AAixUyk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Clavier fou ou Yahoo QR malade?	Je subis une foule de bafouillages insupportables avec le clavier intégré de mon nouveau laptop. J'écris un mot sans regarder et j'en retrouve les letttres dispersés ?à et là dans le corps du texte déjà tapé. SURTOUT (pas exclusivement) quand j'écris directement dans la fenêtre de réponse de Yahoo Q/R. Forcé d'écrire sous Notepad ou Word, sinon insupportable. Mais même ainsi, incidents.   Quand j'ai acheté ce laptop c'était avec l'assurance de pouvoir y brancher mon clavier "ergonomique" SAMSUNG (avec fonctions Internet)... mais pas possible : le plug du laptop est à 7 trous (3 au dessus, 4 en dessous) alors que le jack du Clavier Samsung est à 6 pins (en rosace - avec au centre une base en plastique). Alors question : mieux vaut-il acheter un adaptateur (s'il existe) ou un nouveau clavier?

20081028223921AAaUQCV	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Has anyone had problems with audio when watching videos with Mozilla Firefox?	Sometimes, I'll be watching a web video using Firefox, and for no apparent reason, the audio will go out.  It will stay off until I restart my computer.  There doesn't seem to be a pattern.  I don't change any settings, the audio just stops working.  This happens with videos from many sites, so I don't think there's something about the videos that causes the problem.  I don't believe it's my computer, because the audio will continue working in other applications.  For example, I can use Internet Explorer to look at the same video...without changing any settings,  the audio will work again.  Any ideas?

20081029203337AAl8cY0	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Husband passed away- Email password needed!!?	My husband passed away in December and I have been trying and trying to get into his AOL email account.  He had at least 20 accounts all over the internet and I knew every single password (because we never hid anything from each other).  But, I can't remember his AOL password.  On top of that, his security question is "What is your favorite movie?"... Well, he LOVED movies.  I tried over 100 of his favorites and everyday I get blocked from AOL and have to wait 24hrs to try again.  I have contacted AOL and they will not help me.  I want into that email!  It is very personal and important to me for many reasons.  Please, are there any suggestions?  Are there any FREE downloads that hack emails or something?  plus, we got our new laptop just 2 days before he passed, so I don't think the password is hidden or stored in the computer anywhere.  Please help!

20081116204142AAHRCbY	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Youtube video not longer available?	This is my first problem. When I go to a video, it tells me that the video is no longer available. It isn't one of those red banner things at the top of the screen, so please don't tell me that Youtube or the user removed it. Instead, it is inside of this black box that should be where the video is playing. I think it might have something to do with my connection and browser settings, but I don't know how to fix this. I was wondering if there was something that I could do about it.      Another problem that I have is where the page doesn't load everything and I have to reload it about 7 times. This is quite irritating as well, and I was hoping to do something about that along with my first problem.      Finally, another thing in Youtube is where I try to watch the video and it comes out all weird and stuff. All of the site is in text, and there are a bunch of hyperlinks. It makes no sense, like it can't read the HTML or XML or whatever they use.

Now, that said my current power supply on my computer is 500W. However, when i was searching online and at some local computer stores for a new PSU, i discovered a secondary PSU that only cost 40 dollars (same as this one http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddet... ) and it occupies one of the empy hard drive slots in your comp.     So my question is, if i were to hook up the gtx 260 up to my primary 500W PSU anddd this extra 400W psu ( 80% or higher efficient) then would the card function properly? Or is this kind of power imput unsafe for the card????    I believe the gtx 260 recquires 550W ?     Thanks!

Prior to this 6200 I was using an Intel 82945G Express Chipset.  The CD that came with the 6200 said to uninstall all other video drivers, so once I had done that Windows told me to reboot so I turned the computer off, inserted the 6200, turned the PC back on, installed the drivers for the 6200, and disabled the Intel chipset via device manager.

20090130193724AABuXIv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I need help with an internet cable?	Okay, so there are two internet cables in my house (we have AOL   dial-up).  There's one in my room, and one in our living room.  We have Dell Windows XP computers, one is a laptop and the other is a regular PC.  The cable in my room is for my laptop, and the one in the living room is for the PC (but it works on the laptop too).  For the past two weeks my laptop has not been able to connect to AOL in my room, but our PC has (the PC's in the living room).  Today I plugged my laptop into the living room wire and the internet access works fine.  Which would naturally lead me to believe that the wire in my room is just broken, but here's the thing: the cord phone that can run off that same wire still works if you plug it in!               So, do I need a new cord (and where do i get one for        cheap- and not online- I have no credit card) ?  I'm not sure what kind of wire I need though.  The wires we use are silvery-gray colored.  Help!

20090130194347AAJnSud	Computers & Internet;Security	Is this some kind of malware?	So. The cable guy came over to fix our internet connection, because it wasn't working since we came back from vacation. He went on my laptop in the living room and the pointer went haywire (I don't have a mouse, it's just a touch pad). He said, "Looks like you have a trojan" and I was like whatever. That was the first time it happened.. but now it's happening more often. And now I can't connect to the internet, even when I'm right next to the signal thingy.Sorry if I'm vague and non-descriptive but I don't know much about routers and stuff.. so here goes.   There are 3 computers in the house. 2 have wireless connection and 1 is wired. We don't have dial-up, and we the company that gives us our internet is the same as the one that gives us cable and phone connection. My mom's computer works fine in my room but my laptop doesn't (they're both wireless). The black rectangular prism shaped box by my sister's computer with the blinking lights that say cable, send, receive and power (among others) is brand Scientific Atlanta and is model DPR2320R2. It also says cable modem/gateway. The signal thingy that is connected to it is D-Link. Also, the internet connection detection thing in the bar in the bottom right corner on my laptop says that my wireless internet connection is excellent, but even then I can't view any pages in Firefox. I ran a virus scan but all I found was something with Win32 in it, and the virus program couldn't remove it.. Right now I'm running trend micro house call (online virus scanner). If it helps, I defragged my computer this morning after running Eusing's free registry cleaner (380 problems detected). I'm really sorry if this isn't enough information, just ask if you need any more. Thank you :)

20090130185613AAjDXIE	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Ripping off Deviant art?	You all probably know deviantart.com, best website for fanart, art, and such.  I noticed sometimes you can order a print of an image or download it for money.  I understand authors sometimes need money to continue their work.  Well, I noticed they have some kind of a fail-safe, they don't let you drag the picture to your desktop.  I have a mac and I just right click the photo, press "Open image in new tab" and drag it from there.  This works for images you have to pay to download too.  Is this ripping off deviantart?  I'm really concerned if I should stop.  Anybody know? does ordering pictures give you a bigger resolution, or did a 14 year-old accidentally find a way to cheat the system?
