AA10702349	No, I find none in the Bible. It is crystal clear that the Biblical witness in the OT and NT teaches that the prophets and the apostles, as well as Jesus Himself, are in full agreement about just Whom He is (e.g., Psalm 22; Isaiah 7:14, 9:6, 53; Micah 5:2; Ephesians 2:20; 1 Peter 1:10-12), since they were all guided by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, within them. And, quite honestly, I find that it's no coincidence that I feel the same way as the Holy Scriptures mention about those who teach about a different Jesus than our Lord and Savior. This just goes to show that the Holy Spirit in me also is in full agreement with God's inscripturated Word (John 14:26; 16:14; 1 Corinrthians 2:10-15, 2 Peter 1:19-20).   <br>  <br>  Those who once held to a Biblical view of Whom He is, of being the One and Only God the Son (John 1:1,14,18; 8:58; 20:28), and the only Way to the Father (John 14:6; Acts 4:12), by placing their trust in Him alone, and not in their works (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7), nor in any organization and/or doctrine of men (Matthew 15:9; John 1:13; Ephesians 4:14; 1 Timothy 1:3), but then no longer do, I believe have been tricked (or "bamboozled" as we say on the streets today) into believing a lie by the father of lies. The Apostle Paul says that they have been led astray by the evil one, just as our first ancestor Eve was by the serpeant. And just as he, I feel a deep godly zeal and jealousy for their return to being among those as a faithful bride to their "Husband" (2 Corinthians 11:2-4), our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. They are like sheep whom have left the fold and have been led astray by an evil, self-absorbed hireling. Sadly, unless these sheep come to their senses, and allow themselves to be rescued by the Good Shepherd out of the hireling's clutches, they will be led to the slaughter and devoured by wolves in the day of judgement (John 10:7-13).<br>  <br>  Of course, then there are those hirelings who've never professed to believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior, and take great pride in leading others astray by teaching any of a multitude of perverse doctrines of men regarding Whom the Christ is. These folks audaciously claim to be Biblical scholars and have taught many answerers here apostate teachings, such as godless liberal theology [i.e., those who make claims to the inauthenticity of the New Testament, and even shamelessly about the Christ being just a mythical figure, (such as what answerer Moses has mentioned) falsely attesting to have history and science on their side. However, if one would investigate these spurious claims, as I have (see my best answers to "Christians: Why some people reject Christ?" and "Why did the people who wrote the Bible take out all of Jesus' early years?" in the Yahoo! Answers S & R section), and answerer Edward J has regarding the false accusations that Jesus' teachings were influenced by the cult of Mithras by answerer Gorgeoustx, one would quickly discover that a wicked agenda of propaganda and misinformation is what really characterizes such claims. (See the book "The Case For Christ" by Lee Strobel)]. <br>  <br>  These hirelings also include those throughout church history who were instrumental in establishing synagogues of Satan (Revelation 2:9) that propagate spurious doctrines about the person of Christ, such as various brands of Arianism (who claim that Jesus is not God Who became flesh, John 1:14; Philippians 2:6; 1 John 4:2), such as with the contemporary Russellites (JW's), and who sadly confuse the Son's subordinate ROLE in creation and redemption to His Father (Psalm 8:4-5; John 14:28, 1 Corinthians 15:27-28; Philippians 2:6-8; Hebrews 2:6-9) with His ESSENCE before His Father (see John 5:18; Philippians 2:6; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3; Revelation 1:17 in comparison with Revelation 22:13 and Isaiah 44:6), as answerer Stampeder did here. I do wish all these instigators of deception upon the well-intentioned like Stampeder, such as Charles Taze Russell, Judge Rutherford and all the present day spiritual leaders at the WTS, to be accursed, just as the Apostle Paul mentions in Galatians 1:6-9, for they are instrumental in leading so many others toward, and inevitably into, damnation. It appears that their judgement is much greater than those who were deceived by them. Jesus said in Mark 9:42, "And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck."<br>  <br>  So I guess my feelings about this matter are quite sobering. However, what I feel is of no immediate, nor eternal, consequence to those who do teach and follow an unbiblical Jesus and a false gospel. It's what God feels and has said in His inscripturated Word that does.|`|PvqLMauCaa	keep in mind that historical evidence is very different than the gospels in the bible.  There were almost 40 different gospels that were never included in the bible.  Even the gospels of judas.  There were also gnostic text. Excuse my spelling if thats wrong.  These were written supposively during the life of jesus and depict him as more human laughing and playing and cheerful, the gospels that were chosen to be used, mathew, mark, luke, and john were all writen over 60 years after jesus supposively died.  All this can be up in the air because to real historians there is no account of any on named jesus christ actually existing.  People back then were taxed heavily and record keeping was actually really tight.  Jesus being a carpenter would have had to pay these taxes and there is no documentation of him being alive.

Biblical scholars are now saying that Paul, the alleged author of 13 out of the 27 (maybe more) books of the New Testament, may have been influenced in his writings by this strong religion of Mithraism.  We can see a profound kinship between Mithraism and Christianity.<br>  <br>  The original "Christian" faith became a mix of pagan, Mithramic, Jeudeo/Christian teaching. This lead to the confusing mix of theology that we have today within the "Christian" community. This apostacy from the original simple and plain teachings of Christ was accelerated by the persecutions and killings of any who tried to support the "old" ways. Maybe this solves the mystery of the “ungodly” marriage between Mithraism and the cult of Jesus. As it turns out, it was all for political convenience! But, Christians think they are better than that today. In short: The "Christianity" they have today has almost no relationship, in doctrine or in way of life, to the "the original teachings of Jesus."|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	If I thought the Bible was just another book, written by human authors and only containing various people's ideas about God, then I wouldn't bother to quote it or build my life on it. It would be like any other religious book: a collection of thoughts about God which might or might not be true.<br>  <br>  But I am persuaded the Bible is more than that—that it is God's Word in written form, given to us so we can know Him and learn how He wants us to live. As a young preacher, I went through a period of doubt about the Bible, realizing that if it wasn't God's Word, then I didn't have a reliable message to give to people. But after a period of intense searching and struggle I came away convinced that the Bible is indeed God's Word, and "All Scripture is God-breathed" (2 Timothy 3:16).<br>  <br>  One reason I came to accept the Bible as God's Word was because of what Jesus said about the Scriptures. Repeatedly He quoted them as the Word of God, and He declared that "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away" (Mark 13:31). If Jesus accepted the Scriptures as God's Word, shouldn't I also as His follower?<br>  <br>  I urge you to get acquainted with the Bible personally, asking God to speak to you through its pages. Begin with one of the Gospels, for there you will meet the Bible's center—who is Jesus Christ. He will change you, as you open your life to Him.|`|EJHhCDcaaa	I know of no errors of the person of Jesus Christ's teachings.  I have seen many errors on the part of man's teachings of Jesus Christ.

(1 John 3:7).<br>  <br>  "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, that you might not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son". (2 John 7-9).<br>  <br>  "I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you, and want to distory the gospel of Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed". (Galatians 1:6-9).<br>  <br>  Notice the nature of the Bible command, "Let no one in any way deceive you" etc. It is up to each of us, whether we be "high up" or "low down" in the body of believers, to carefully check out everything with the word of God. Remember the Apostle Paul said "I have fully preached the gospel of Christ". (Romans 15:19). Also,..."learn not to exceed what is written, in order that no one of you might become arrogant in behalf of one against the other". (2 Cor. 4:6). <br>  <br>  That's pretty plain, isn't it? We are protected if we stay with the Bible. If Christ was "fully preached" in the days of the apostles, why listen to different doctrine on Christ invented by some modern-day teacher? <br>  <br>  We all need to stay within the Word of God, the Bible, and dismiss anything extra!.  Each one of us is responsible for ourselves! <br>  <br>  "Let no man deceive himself...". (1 Cor. 3:18).|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	I have hung around Yahoo Answers Religion & Spirituality section for well over two years, and even here I have seen lots of wacky ideas about who and what Jesus is, none of which are supported solidly by the Bible. Some have managed to use cherry- picked scriptures (while ignoring other scriptures) to build a flimsy foundation for their ideas, but none of them hold water! <br>  <br>  It makes me sad to see that people try to make the scriptures into what THEY want or like instead of what they really are. It really brings into focus Colossians 2:8- "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." The problem is when people forget which is which over time, and you end up with man's philosophies mixing in with Bible truth. Sooner or later, people end up accepting the mix as truth. <br>  <br>  One excellent example is the "remix" of 1 John 5:7. Although the phrase "...in heaven; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one" has been PROVEN to not belong in the original manuscripts, it is widely accepted as part of the Holy Bible since so many people for so long have FORCED it into the scriptures because they WANT it there. Nevertheless, the truth of God's word can still be found, regardless of how much man tries to tamper with it!|`|gDVQNMR7aa	No, his teachings are a wise and true guide to a spiritual path and the key to the Kingdom.

If you are ready to see what murderers will post on the internet to justify bombing and maiming their fellow citizens hit this link. <a href="http://www.armyofgod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.armyofgod.com/</a> The pictures on the site are nothing compared to the murders of grown, breathing, loved and living children and adults killed by the pro lifers. Don't let the photos shake you, they are fake. And they are simply used to make the murderers feel better about supporting other murdering pro lifers. The absolute truth about abortion is that abortion saves lives in the long run. When you read a pro lifers response, just keep in mind that their actions speak louder than the bombs used by the army of god. When a pro lifer convinces someone to save a fetus they are condemning a child to death. I wish with all my heart that both fetus and child could be saved. But they cannot. <a href="http://www.prolifeismurder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prolifeismurder.com</a>|`|2Hot9EJiaa	it never ceases to amaze me-  anti-abortion extremists are VERY VERY VERY rare.   There are so many more people who are pro-life that would never, ever think about bombing a clinic in the name of Christ- those people are horrible, they are as anti-life as the abortionists themselves.

The LAST thing Satan desires is for us to BELIEVE in God. How better to do this than to mix up LOTS of different religious ideas and confuse the HECK out of our finite minds... no matter HOW "intelligent" we may be.<br>  <br>  There IS such a thing as Universal Truth.  There IS such a thing as ONE TRUE religion.  And don't let ANY of these answerers lead you to believe otherwise.  As Jesus said to His disciples, "If it were not so, I would have told you."  What God speaks is the TRUTH... and God CANNOT LIE.  Based upon these two TRUTHS alone, all the arguments you've read fall to pieces. <br>  <br>  HOLD to the TRUTH.... God does exist, and there IS only ONE True faith.... if this were NOT SO, God would have TOLD US!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a blessed day.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	This person is obviously NOT as intelligent as you think.|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	Because there is no way to say for sure they aren't.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	Just because a person is intelligent does not mean they cant have personal opinions about religions...|`|gDVQNMR7aa	What makes YOU so sure they aren't?

If you were 100% faithful in your belief ...let's say the difference between Christian and Mormon....how could you say one if these beliefs are absolute right? If you are following God's law by the way you read and interpret the bible then how can you be wrong. I for one do not belive one religion will get to Heaven. There wasn't even a religion in Jesus day<br>  So, I guess there is two of us who belive that God is Love, God will never let us down.

Believe whatever you want to believe, any religion, any philosophy. He apparently has found his path through spirituality. Don't confuse spirituality with religion or even a belief in God.<br>  Your friend has seen that the world is exactly the way it should be. And the people in it are just the way they should be.<br>  Through spirituality I found peace and serenity.No religion could have done that for me. Yes, some people find God through their spirituality but as I said it's not necessary.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	It sounds like your friend is a Unitarian Universalist. They generally believe that every religion is simply looking at a single facet of the jewel that is God. So it is true regarding its own facet, and partially true regarding the jewel as a whole.|`|AA11135281	Perhaps he only meant that all religious viewpoints are equally valid and, as such, should all be respected?<br>  <br>  I've often heard it said that all the diverse religions are different paths to the same goal.

For instance, in saying that all religions are correct, your friend might mean that they believe that, since all religions basically believe in a higher power of some kind, that it doesn't really matter what one calls that higher power. Religions also, typically, all teach basic laws of morality. If one interprets religions very loosely, it seems that they could all tell the same story of why we're here and what we should do while we're here, but in different ways.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	They say genius is close to insanity, so your clever friend could still be a loony tune.|`|enWGuc6taa	It's the way a certain individual was raised.

Sometimes *too* open minded can turn into looney..|`|HurAky2raa	Your friend may be intelligent to some degree but sure is ridiculously ignorant.|`|x68JfsS1aa	Sometimes people don't think about religion rationally, no matter how intelligent they are.  There could be a few reasons why a person would believe all religions are correct;  they may want to be accepted by the people they know in different religions, so they refuse to contradict any one.  Or they just don't know what they believe, or which is right.  To cope they say all religions are, avoiding the real issues such as eternity.  Maybe they don't care.  If they really believe that all religions are correct they they must not really believe in religion as a whole.  All religions don't agree with any simple subject not even a creator.|`|f3z5VCAOaa	Of course it is possible to believe in a religion and be intelligent.  All religions (minus Scientology, that's just a money-making gimmick) are based on the same school of thought: there is only one God, believe in him entirely or suffer for all of eternity.  Which, to intelligent people seems so, 1600s, right?  There is no way the earth was created in 7 days, people cannot live in whales and water cannot be made into wine and if all of these things can happen, isn't that witchcraft?  There are so many questions that are left unanswered about religion that "intelligent" people (usually college educated, scientific theory only -going, young individuals) usually don't believe in any of the structured religions today.  They are either agnostics or atheists.  But perhaps this person you speak of has had a terrible, emotional disaster happen to him or her i.e. one of their parent's died or best friend died, then they would probably turn to religion, any one, and want to find a shred of evidence.  Just so they can take comfort that maybe the person he/she lost (or whatever other terrible occurrence has happen) is not lost forever.|`|igj6p3Zzaa	maybe they don't mean they personally believe in all the religions that exist, but that every1 is justified in believing what they want to. and perhaps they believe that all religions are correct because there is always a reason behind believing what people believe in. or possibly they think that all the religions have something in common, perhaps a hell and a heaven. or that there is in fact a God existing. maybe this person you are referring to thinks that there is at least one part of each religion that is correct.  however, there truly is no correct religion because religion cannot be proven in life sice religion means:a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects. and you cannot PROVE faith and you cannot PROVE what you believe, because then you are not truly believing or truly having faith.<br>  belief: 1. something believed; an opinion or conviction <br>  2. confidence in the truth or existence of something not immediately susceptible to rigorous proof <br>  3. confidence; faith; trust <br>  <br>  try to look at the deeper meaning of things.<br>  look at the words BEHIND the words.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  btw, thanks for the 2 points :) :)|`|QCgzoGSGaa	I think what they mean is that Truth is subjective, so whatever you believe it's true to you.|`|STb94U07aa	Maybe they believe that if you look far enough back at all religions, they pretty much come to the same conclusion. Also they can think that people can believe in what they want to, because to them; it's real. There also is a possibility s/he doesn't believe in the whole religion just parts of each one. After all it is there believes the have the right to think what they want to.|`|MNDvP3rxaa	religion isnt an intelligent matter, it is a spiritual/faith matter. you dont have to have a certain intelligence level in order to believe in any religion. i understand where you are coming from, cause they are so different how could a person actually believe in them all, but i think that person really just doesnt know what to believe and likes the idea of each of them so chooses to have an open mind about religion in general.|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	hi there.Im not religious im more of fate and destiny.|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	They may all be different, but they still all have common underlying themes in them. I think acid really help me see the truth in all religion and how there is no right or wrong. From my perspective they are all based on the human experience. You have to look past all the cultural dogma and look for univerial messages that are being expressed through the myth and symbolism.|`|AA11519604	You have to go back 1000′s of years to understand...

After the Barbarians sacked Rome and destroyed all Europe best they could, the social order fell apart.

Will you accept a Harvard historian of world-renown ?<br>  <br>  Religion and the Rise of Western Culture  <br>  by Christopher Dawson <br>  <br>  ===========================<br>  Numbers and Lindberg note that recent historical research suggests that this portrayal of the early middle ages as “the dark ages” is a caricature. (David C Lindberg “The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon and the Handmaiden Metaphor” in When Science & Christianity Meet, ed. David C. Lindberg & Ronald L. Numbers (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2003) 7-8). A conclusion shared by the studies of Henri Pirenne (A History of Europe from the End of the Roman World in the West to the Beginning of Western States, (New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1958)) and Marc Bloch (Feudal Society, (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1961)) and Richard Hodge (“The Not So Dark Ages,” Archaeology 51 (September/October 1998).<br>  <br>  Contemporary encycolpaedias bear this out; the 1975 New Columbia Encyclopaedia states that the term “dark ages” is no longer used by historians because this period is “no longer thought to have been so dim.’ Similarly the Encyclopaedia Britannica states the term “dark ages” is “now rarely used by historians because of the unacceptable value judgment it implies,” the term “dark ages” incorrectly implies this was “a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity.”|`|AA11297267	While I agree with your point, you're factually incorrect.<br>  First, you're only talking about most of Europe and some of Asia -- not the whole world.<br>  Second, no -- NOT all people believed in god.  Yes, the church ruled, and so people who did not believe in god usually had to *pretend* to in order to avoid being burned to death, but there were still plenty of non-believers.<br>  <br>  The big problem with the dark ages was that government and religion were so intertwined, and the churches had political power.  That's a lesson we should all learn from and NOT repeat.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	Actually, nowadays only ignorant people really use that phrase:<br>  <br>  "Increased understanding of the accomplishments of the Middle Ages in the 19th century challenged the characterization of the entire period as one of darkness,[4] and thus the term is often restricted to periods within the Middle Ages, namely the Early Middle Ages; though this usage is also disputed by most modern scholars, who tend to avoid using the phrase"|`|boqwvEvUaa	yeah, and they were named the "DARK Ages" for a good reason ;) several good reasons, actually...|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	Oh, for a minute there I thought you were referring to the reign of George W.

Like today, civilisation and learning varied from place to place in the world. After the Romans went, civilisation in Britain dropped back hundreds of years, and this is why these are called the Dark Ages, not because of any religious beliefs, but because hardly any written history survives from that time.|`|uBpx2JDGaa	Funny, I thought the "dark ages" resulted from the power struggle that followed the collapse of the Roman Empire and involved complex political and military actions by feuding war lords all over Europe.

S9zfwGefaa	here 10 1. Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light?<br>  After coming home late and getting ready for bed in the dark, a college coed wakes up the next morning to receive the shock of her life.<br>  2. Bloody Mary<br>  The young girls stood in front of the bathroom mirror with the lights out, chanting "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." The thirteenth time something strange happened -- a bloody, disfigured face appeared in the mirror. It was a woman. And she was angry...<br>  3. The Boyfriend's Death<br>  Late at night on an isolated country road, a teenage girl waits for her boyfriend to return to the car after going outside to relieve himself. After what seems like an eternity, she is startled by the sound of something scraping across the roof of the vehicle...<br>  4. Buried Alive!<br>  Many years ago before the medical technology we now have for monitoring patients' life signs existed, an elderly woman was pronounced dead and scheduled for burial. Family members literally had to pry her unembalmed body from the clutches of her husband, who protested that she wasn't really dead. Over his objections, her body was lowered into the ground...<br>  5. The Fatal Hairdo<br>  A very stylish teenage girl grew tired of spending hours carefully "ratting" (teasing) and spraying her hair to attain an extreme beehive do. She washed her hair in sugar water, allowing it to harden in the style she wanted. At night, she carefully wrapped a towel around it and slept on a special half-pillow designed to not disturb the hair. One morning, she failed to come down for breakfast...<br>  6. The Hook<br>  A teenage boy drove his date to a dark and deserted Lovers' Lane for a make-out session. After turning on the radio for mood music, he leaned over and began kissing the girl. A short while later, the music suddenly stopped and an announcer's voice came on, warning in an urgent tone that a convicted murderer had just escaped from the state insane asylum...<br>  7. Humans Can Lick, Too<br>  Once there was a a beautiful young girl who lived in a small town just south of Farmersburg. Her parents had to go to town for a while, so they left their daughter home alone, but protected by her dog, which was a very large collie. The parents told the girl to lock all the windows and doors after they had left...<br>  8. The Kidney Thieves<br>  The crime begins when a business traveler goes to a lounge for a drink at the end of the work day. A person in the bar walks up and offers to buy him a drink. The last thing the traveler remembers until he wakes up in a hotel room bathtub, his body submerged up to his neck in ice, is sipping that drink. There is a note taped to the wall instructing him not to move and to call 911...<br>  9. The Killer in the Backseat<br>  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. She noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers...<br>  10. The Roommate's Death<br>  As she entered the dorm room, she heard her roommate's rocking chair squeaking in the corner, but couldn't see it, not all the lights were on. Must be waiting for me, Sarah thought. Putting her stuff away, she went back into the main room. From the corner came a voice...
E70A7aqcaa	I think public, or even "semi-public" breast feeding is ugly, disrespectful of the mother and everyone around, and wholly undisciplined in character.  In my opinion, it goes right along with whether it's okay to pass gas (fart) in public, or in some supposedly semi-hidden location.  It still stinks no matter where you do it, and no one else wants to see it, or smell it.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	uh..yea...modesty in everything you do is kinda what Muslims are known for<br>  <br>  nursing w/o covering is unnecessary unless the child perhaps has some allergic reaction to the material or something<br>  <br>  otherwise please cover op!<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|AA11176279	i definitely don't think it should be done in public. however, if you're in a public place and there is no way you can get out of it, i suggest you go in a quiet place and cover yourself up as much as possible.<br>  <br>  as for that lady at the baby shower, i think it's ok that she did it then and there, but she should have used a blanket. it's all good and all that she is comfortable with it, but people like that need to realize that it makes other people really uncomfortable. be considerate.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim<br>  <br>  Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br>  <br>  The awrah of women in front of other women is what is between the navel and the knee.  So technically, it is not haraam to expose your breast in front of other women.  This does not mean that we Muslim women can go to each others homes for tea and take off our tops - one of the main characteristics of Islam is modesty, for men and women, and for women among women we must be modest as well.  So it is better to cover and not reveal ourselves in front of other women.  Sometimes, even if you try to cover, you might have a squirmy baby who grabs your hijab or nursing cover at the wrong time and you accidentally show something, but this is something that is an accident and is different than just flopping out a breast and letting everyone see. <br>  <br>  I have had four children, and I have never had a problem in staying modestly covered while nursing in public, either in the masjid or out at the park or even in a restaurant.  There are ways to discreetly nurse and it should not be necessary to expose one's breast in public.  It is a cultural habit to not be careful in this regard, but we cannot say it is "haraam".  If you feel uncomfortable with the extent to which a lady is uncovering, you can avert your eyes while she nurses.

If it were her sister and mother and best friend, then ok, but in a group of mixed women there may be some, that for whatever reason are not comfortable seeing that. <br>  <br>  It is perfectly natural, and beautiful in fact, but I think she should have been more aware of others and used a blanket to cover herself while feeding.

p4A3EIHnaa	Alritey then. But why do you strongly hate a group of people even though they didn't cause any personal problems for you. We can't give death sentence to people for hurting themselves. What kind of an example is that? Your killing them for killing themselves..whats the point? They're harming themselves, not you. What about the people that go around driving drunk? What about people that don't obey the speed limit and kill OTHER INNOCENT people?<br>  This problem needs to be dealt with, but in a much more calm manner. Maybe they have reasons for messing themselves up. We need to get to the root of the problem. You can't get rid of the whole problem though. Seriously, you just gave yourself so much stress over this, and you're solution for this problem is horrible.<br>  I'm a non stoner and I don't want to see people executed. Give them a chance at life by helping them. Um and I know a lot of non stoners who believe that pot should be legalized so we can lower the crime rate. <br>  If we killed all the stoners today, more will form tomorrow. You'll eventually kill off majority of the population. <br>  I never heard something so ridiculous in my life.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	Wow. How can you categorize every pot smoker like this: "a bunch of yellow-bellied, spineless, laid-back, unmotivated pansy scumbags."<br>  That's pretty presumptuous and narrow minded of you. Do you drink? If so, then how can you be so self righteous? Personally, I feel alcohol should be made illegal as it ruins far more lives than marijuana does. When have you every heard of marijuana inducing states of aggression the way alcohol does? Who has ever gotten stoned and beat the crap out of their wife and kids... hmm??? <br>  <br>  What reason do you have to be so hateful toward pot users anyhow? Live and let live, man. Why not focus your aggression toward alcohol-induced domestic violence instead? There is a far bigger problem here than the "laid-back" stoners who just keep to themselves anyway.|`|F9e0lY50aa	I personally think you have some personal issues you need to work out. First all, i will say ARROGANTLY that i smoke weed. I was a straight A student in high school, and have a wonderful job and a happy marriage, For you to say all pot-smokers should be done away with is just dumb. Smoking weed is someones personal decision. I don't think weed should be legalized cause then I will have to pay $30 for a dime sack because of the governments taxes. I also do not support Phelps. I believe he should have been punished, just as a regular person would have been, but because he is "famous" he got away with it. I believe that you need to get off your high horse and stop judging people because some of the very people that you love and are extremely close to might be hitting the bong behind closed doors.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	I'll just say...I used to smoke pot, it's a personal decision, also it was my personal decision to stop, I don't hate pot-heads, I was one. And I certainly wouldn't go around killing anyone holding a bong.. You need to get yourself in check. Not all potheads think that pot should be legalized, not all potheads are arrogant.. you aren't a pothead and you seem pretty arrogant.. How much better are you than them, I know that potheads aren't out to kill all of a certain kind of people either. BTW, Phelps is just a person who had a goal and worked for it, was successful and now he's famous. He didn't go around talking BS to stir some attention.

It is not visible to human eyes. It is the secret of GOD creation and it is invisible. Feelings is because of the present of the soul in our body. When one body is not functioning/death the soul will leave the body and this visible world and the soul which originally already have feelings will feel what is ahead of it in the next/soul world.

The European subspecies was introduced into the eastern United States in the 1600’s, where it interbred with the local subspecies. Vulpes vulpes was present in Texas until the end of the Pleistocene, only to be "reintroduced" into the state in the late 1800’s.

h5q89E3Haa	How does Jesus define Grace?<br>  <br>  Act 6:8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.  <br>  <br>  Christ was clear that Grace is contingent on Repentance and works.<br>  <br>  Mat 5:16 "Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.  <br>  <br>  Jhn 14:12 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater {works} than these he will do; because I go to the Father.  <br>  <br>  Eph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.  <br>  <br>  1Ti 2:10 but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.  <br>  <br>  1Ti 5:10 having a reputation for good works; {and} if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, {and} if she has devoted herself to every good work.  <br>  <br>  1Ti 6:18 {Instruct them} to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,  <br>  <br>  Jam 2:20 But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, I have to agree with "defender" on this one.  Clearly, Paul is not speaking of good works here, but rather of the works of The Law.  Besides - Roman Catholics recognize that they cannot "earn" salvation through works, and that it is a "free gift of God's grace" that allows them (or any Christian) to obtain salvation.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com/selector_rc.html|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Rom. 3:20,28; Gal. 2:16,21; 3:2,5,10; Eph. 2:8-9 - many Protestants err in their understanding of what Paul means by "works of the law” in his teaching on justification. Paul’s teaching that we are not justified by “works of the law” refer to the law of Moses or to any legal system that makes God our debtor. They do not refer to good works done in grace with faith in Christ. This makes sense when we remember that Paul's mission was to teach that salvation was also for the Gentiles who were not subject to the "works of the law." Here is the proof:<br>  <br>  James 2:24 – compare the verse “a man is justified by works and not by faith alone” to Gal. 2:16 – “a man is not justified by works of the law,” and Rom. 3:20,28 – “no human being will be justified in His sight by works of the law.” James 2:24 appears to be inconsistent with Gal. 2:16 and Rom. 3:20,28 until one realizes that the Word of God cannot contradict itself. This means that the “works” in James 2:24 are different from the “works of the law in Gal. 2:16 and Rom. 3:20,28. James is referring to “good works” (e.g.,clothing the naked; giving food to the poor) and Paul is referring to the “Mosaic law” (which included both the legal, moral and ceremonial law) or any works which oblige God to give us payment. Here is more proof:<br>  <br>  Rom. 3:20,28; Gal. 2:16 - Paul's phrase for "works of the law" in the Greek is "ergon nomou" which means the Mosaic law or Torah and refers to the teachings (legal, moral) and works (ceremonial) that gave the Jews the knowledge of sin, but not an escape from sin. We have further proof of this from the Dead Sea Scrolls which provide the Hebrew equivalent ("hrvt ysm") meaning "deeds of the law," or Mosaic law. James in James 2 does not use "ergon nomou." He uses "ergois agathois." Therefore, Paul’s "works of the law" and James' "works" are entirely different types of works. Again, they could never contradict each other because the Scriptures are the inspired word of God. <br>  <br>  ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH, OR ARE YOU JUST DEFENDING OPINIONS FROM THE 16TH CENTURY?<br>  <br>   Eph. 2:8-9 - we have been saved by grace through faith, not because of "works," lest anyone boast. This much-quoted verse by Protestants refers to the "works" of the Mosaic law or any works performed in a legalistic sense, where we view God as a debtor to us, and not as our heavenly Father. Paul is teaching us that, with the coming of Christ, we are now saved by grace through faith, not by Mosaic or legal works.<br>  <br>  This is why Paul refers to “works of ourselves” and so we can’t “boast.” Paul says the same thing about “works” Rom. 4:2,4 – if Abraham was justified by “works,” he would have something to “boast” about. Here, the wages are not counted as grace, but debt. “Boasting” does not attribute works to God, but to oneself. But good works done in faith are necessary for justification (James 2:24, etc.) because we receive rewards by grace, not by legal obligation, and we attribute these works to God, not ourselves.<br>  <br>  Eph. 2:10 - in quoting Ephesians 2:8-9, Protestants invariably ignore the very next verse. Right after Paul's teaching on "works" referring to Mosaic law, Paul says we are created in Christ for "good works" - a clear distinction between "works of law" (Mosaic law/legal payment) and "good works" (law of Christ/reward of grace). <br>  <br>  MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY IGNORING JAMES 2:24?|`|c73cac86901ee77d1060c607b55ea156aa	We don't believe that we are saved by our works.  This was put to rest a long time ago, but everyone must not have gotten the word.<br>  <br>  Also - check Revelations Chapter 20, in which it is noted that we are judged by our deeds.  So while our deeds cannot save us, they sure as heck can condemn us.<br>  <br>  Salvation is not a one-time affair.<br>  <br>  And faith without works is dead, per James.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	Rom. 11:6,11 - justification is no longer based on "works" of the law, but on the grace of Christ. Why? Because salvation is also for the Gentiles.  **note.  works of the law***  context !!!

jbAr62ybaa	First of all, let me suggest the following.<br>  <br>       As soon as you can arrange it, stay over-night away from your home, after first having a good meal out: stay with a friend/relative or last resort, get a hotel/motel room.  <br>  <br>       The reason for this is so you can be rested, feeling reasonably well; in order the next day to then spend a full 24 hrs.(or more)at your home, in meditation/contemplation, after your first explore, experiment, by confronting this entity and yourself, in a straight forward manner.<br>  <br>       That they are wanting to harm you in some way, I think is probably most unlikely.  But to resolve the issue once and for all, seems to be a serious and pressing one for you.<br>  <br>        Go to every room, call out "who/what are you?  And what the h*ll do you want?"<br>  <br>         If there's no manifestation of any kind, go to a room where you feel most comfortable; sit or lie down, and wait: be relaxed, take several deep breaths, and let out slowly.  And see what happens.<br>  <br>       Should there be a "negative" manifestation of any kind, then it would seem an intervention would be called for. And even though you're atheist, the Catholic Church does condone exorcism in some cases; it wouldn't hurt you to consult a priest.  Would it?<br>  <br>       Barring that, you might have to pay for a professional psychic to intervene.

3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	I am more spiritual than religious.<br>  <br>  And I get in a trance at times. Gods loving Presence can put us in a trance like state. Where God speaks personally to all of us, our hearts.<br>  Sometimes.<br>  <br>  Or if God has a specific Word for me in my personal prayer time. Usually a trance like happens from the Father, for me. It is feeling a pressure on my head & then my attention goes completely to the Father to be still & listen. And I get a Word from the Father.<br>  Once the Father answered my prayer & said that I could say that God the Father, Word & Holy Spirit Is One Creator God.<br>  Though I can be entranced (in a way) by Jesus or others in the Kingdom of God also.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I should add, that I had been in a breakdown late1990-late1991 (aprox.) This breakdown partially happened because I had practiced self hypnosis. I had basically quit thinking about Jesus for the past 10yrs.<br>  I had a drunken blackout & prayed about it. Very fearful & not able to get better from the hangover. I had been practicing self hypnosis & the black out was a result of a friends comment when I was drunk. They were trying to get me to go home from the Class Reunion dance. I was pushing some away. One friend said, 'Don't worry, She isn't going to remember a thing.'. That is the last thing I remembered. So I had the drunken black out.  I don't know what I did, but I had pictures to look at. I was their when the dance closed & class mates swept the floor.<br>  But then one friend even from grade school had asked me, "What about Jesus. Do you still believe...?". (before the blackout, when I was standing by the fridge ready to refill...) I had forgotten about Jesus. So I had answered something. But she got me to thinking a bit about it.<br>  Maybe it was because of this person that I prayed to God after the black out, etc...<br>  <br>  But what happened a few months later, since I was still practicing self hypnosis tapes; I was in a self induced trance. And I sensed a presence & asked a question & it answered me. Something about returning to the Shepherd... Then I asked it more & it said suspicious... So I told it to repent to God... But then like a vision of a hand reached down & grabbed my heart & twisted it that it hurt much & held it. And that was the beginning of being in a trance for 1yr.<br>  In this trance I couldn't fully wake, nor fully sleep.<br>  But at the end of 1991, I was healed at the River of Life. A Christian friend brought me there, & I went forward at the River 3 Xs. The 3rd time, I was overfilled with the anointing, the Spirit of Truth who leads me in the things the Lord has said...<br>  That was the major healing. I slept soundly that night. And sleep itself does wonders.<br>  Since then, I have renewed my mind in Gods Word & Spirit. And follow after Gods Spiritual leading. Because the Truth is so important to me.

If God didn't create evil the where did the evil come from? Once God chose to create human beings with free choice, then it was up to them, rather than to God, whether there was evil or not. That's what free choice means. Built unto the situation of God deciding to create human beings is the chance of evil and the suffering that results. Then why didn't God create human beings who were unable to choose to hate, destroy, or do all the other things that cause pain or suffering? Why didn't he create people capable only of being kind and loving? Think of it this way, if you push a button on one of those talking Barbie dolls, and it says, "I love you." how meaningful is that? If love or goodness is something programmed into you, something you have no choice about, is it really love? Do you really want to be that doll? Real love must involve a choice.|`|2nSyfXyBaa	It comes from the devil hate evil|`|cECRv4NMaa	Man and all his faults.|`|rUjQM1biaa	I comes from us we create it we also create love but its your choice|`|OXuhjS0jaa	Evil is not a "created" thing, just as love is not a "created" thing.  Therefore, it does not come "from" anyplace, anything, anyone, or anywhere.<br>  <br>  God did NOT create evil.  Evil, like God, existed simply because God existed.  We define evil as the opposite, or even the absence of God, and good.  Where God is present there is "good," where He is not present there is "evil."  Just as darkness is the absence of light, so evil is the absence of God.<br>  <br>  Satan was created by God, yes.  But Satan was an angel, and created perfect, as God created all creation as "good." (See Genesis) But Satan had free will, and chose to deny the Lordship of God, and whenever anyone chooses what is not God's will, then that is sin, and that is "evil."  Satan was the FIRST being to have done this, but he was not evil to begin with.  Just as Adam and Eve were created perfect and good, they CHOSE to sin and had to be separated from God (because God cannot "tolerate" the presence of sin/evil). <br>  <br>  So, evil did not come FROM anywhere, or anyone, or anything, because it is not a "created" thing.  The same holds true if you substitute LOVE for EVIL... love does not come FROM anywhere, or anyone, or anything because it is also not a "created" thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgive others as I have forgiven you.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	Does evil exist?<br>  <br>  The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists?<br>  A student bravely replied yes, he did!"<br>  "God created everything?" The professor asked.<br>  "Yes, sir," the student replied.<br>  <br>  The professor answered, "If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil."<br>  The student became quiet before such an answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another student raised his hand and said, "Can I ask you a question professor?" "Of course", replied the professor. The student stood up and asked, "Professor, does cold exist?"<br>  <br>  <br>  "What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The students snickered at the young man's question.<br>  <br>  <br>  The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Everybody and every object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (- 460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have too little heat.<br>  <br>  <br>  The student continued. "Professor, does darkness exist?"<br>  <br>  <br>  The professor responded, "Of course it does".<br>  <br>  <br>  The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally the young man asked the professor. "Sir, does evil exist?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. "These manifestations are nothing else but evil."<br>  <br>  <br>  To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love, that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light."<br>  <br>  <br>  The professor sat down.<br>  <br>  <br>  The young mans name --- Albert Einstein<br>  23 hours ago|`|pZSZUhXNaa	god created heaven and hell.<br>  god created good and evil.<br>  god created the devil.

Francesco Redi (1626-1679), an Italian physician, demonstrated during mid 17th century by simple experiments that spontaneous generation (abiogenesis) does not exist. He took rotting meat pieces and placed them in jars. He sealed some of these jars tightly and left others open. In a few days, maggots appeared in open jars in which the flies went freely in and out and laid their eggs on meat. Contrary to it, the sealed jars in which the flies could not enter did not show any maggots.<br>  <br>  Even after Redi's convincing demonstration, abiogenesis versus biogenesis controversy continued.  John Needham (1745) advocated that even after he heated chicken broth and corn infusions (nutrient fluids) before pouring them into covered flasks, the cooled solutions showed existence of tiny organisms in them and thus he claimed that the organisms originated spontaneously from the nutrient fluids. We shall see later that this result was due to insufficient heating which failed to kill heat resistant forms of bacteria containing endospores.

The refutation of spontaneous generation applied to modern organisms appearing it milk or bags of grain.  It has nothing to do with conditions of the early Earth.<br>  <br>  2. Is the Earth an isolated system?  No, we have the sun.  The sun produces a vast amount of energy which enables life on Earth to continue.  However, on a whole, the Earth-Sun system does increase in entropy and eventually the sun will give out.  By your definition, life itself would be impossible.<br>  <br>  Edit: Additionally, tell me the first and third laws of thermodynamics.  Don't know?  What is entropy?  Don't know?

Which is why the universe is running down and in a trillion or so years no energetic reactions will be able to take place.  This is the heat death of the universe, when all energy degrades to entropy.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	And what do those do with not believing in deities?<br>  <br>  But just for fun: <br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB...</a><br>  <br>   The spontaneous generation that Pasteur and others disproved was the idea that life forms such as mice, maggots, and bacteria can appear fully formed. They disproved a form of creationism. There is no law of biogenesis saying that very primitive life cannot form from increasingly complex molecules. <br>  <br>  2. <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF001.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF...</a><br>  <br>  As been already pointed out below, the Second Law only applies to closed systems. Earth is NOT a closed system.<br>  <br>     1.  The second law of thermodynamics says no such thing. It says that heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one or, equivalently, that total entropy (a measure of useful energy) in a closed system will not decrease. This does not prevent increasing order because<br>  <br>            * the earth is not a closed system; sunlight (with low entropy) shines on it and heat (with higher entropy) radiates off. This flow of energy, and the change in entropy that accompanies it, can and will power local decreases in entropy on earth.<br>            * entropy is not the same as disorder. Sometimes the two correspond, but sometimes order increases as entropy increases. (Aranda-Espinoza et al. 1999; Kestenbaum 1998) Entropy can even be used to produce order, such as in the sorting of molecules by size (Han and Craighead 2000).<br>            * even in a closed system, pockets of lower entropy can form if they are offset by increased entropy elsewhere in the system. <br>        In short, order from disorder happens on earth all the time.<br>  <br>     2. The only processes necessary for evolution to occur are reproduction, heritable variation, and selection. All of these are seen to happen all the time, so, obviously, no physical laws are preventing them. In fact, connections between evolution and entropy have been studied in depth, and never to the detriment of evolution (Demetrius 2000).<br>  <br>        Several scientists have proposed that evolution and the origin of life is driven by entropy (McShea 1998). Some see the information content of organisms subject to diversification according to the second law (Brooks and Wiley 1988), so organisms diversify to fill empty niches much as a gas expands to fill an empty container. Others propose that highly ordered complex systems emerge and evolve to dissipate energy (and increase overall entropy) more efficiently (Schneider and Kay 1994).<br>  <br>     3. Creationists themselves admit that increasing order is possible. They introduce fictional exceptions to the law to account for it.<br>  <br>     4. Creationists themselves make claims that directly contradict their claims about the second law of thermodynamics, such as hydrological sorting of fossils during the Flood.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	the law of biogenesis refers to an old hypothesis, spontaneous generation which proposed that complex life could form from raw materials (flies from rotting meat for example).  we know this is not true and abiogenesis is not spontaneous generation by any stretch.<br>  <br>  the second law of thermodynamics refers to the usable amount of energy available in a system.  in an isolated system entropy will increases, however the earth is not a closed system and gains energy from the sun (i learned this in elementary school).|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	#1 has been done in the lab: <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080515171023.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <br>  #2 The second law only says that to get order would require an input of energy....you know....like the Sun.

It is wide open|`|LGBNKuxRaa	"modern organisms do not spontaneously arise in nature from non-life."<br>  <br>  wow, you actually got this right, or close enough. in its modern form, pasteur's law is incorporated into cell theory: all modern cells come from pre-existing cells. no one is proposing that modern organisms spontaneously arose from non-life, though. the proposal is that ancient life, which was likely very much simpler than modern life (maybe not even cellular), arose spontaneously from simple chemical systems.<br>  <br>  "the entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium."<br>  <br>  yes.<br>  <br>  "Translation: Order CANNOT come from disorder..."<br>  <br>  rubbish. if this were true, freezing would never happen, your refrigerator wouldn't work, organisms wouldn't grow, and a whole host of other everyday things couldn't happen. obviously, it's not true. why not? entropy is an extensive property, that means that there is a certain amount of entropy associated with each bit of matter. if there is more stuff, all else being equal, there's more entropy. a consquence of this is that entropy can decrease locally to a small extent while increasing elsewhere, and the total entropy of the system will still increase in accordance with the second law. you are probably thinking that entropy is an intensive property, like temperature - it doesn't matter how much stuff is there. well, it isn't like that. too bad for your argument, I guess.<br>  <br>  "You may say the Earth is a closed system, but for those who have studies Science and realize the universe in finite and had a beginning (see Big Bang)... you would know THAT is a closed system..."<br>  <br>  neither of those things are demonstrably true. they might be, but it wouldn't matter. the second law still doesn't forbid local decreases in entropy, no matter how much you want it to. the universe had low entropy in the big bang era and the total amount has been increasing ever since, just as the second law predicts. the time since the big bang is finite, that is all. it is not known whether that was 'the beginning'. it's also not known whether the universe is finite in spatial extent. beyond what we can see, it's just more of the same so far as anyone knows. the observable universe is certainly not a closed system, because the horizon is not a physical boundary.<br>  <br>  in short, study more, and try to stay away from the apologetics. you don't know what you're talking about, and neither do they. you are not challenging atheism, here. you're challenging well-understood science... but then, you are a creationist, I suppose, that's what you do...|`|ki8kdpJPaa	And how exactly does any of what you assert or imply prove God's existence?<br>  <br>  Order can come from disorder, Earth is not a closed system. <br>  <br>  As for the first one, Abiogenesis is not well understood, you religious people want to use science when it is convenient for you so you cherry-pick bits and pieces.

Based on your articulation of the problem, Cars must be created by god cause they can't just spontaneously appear. I'll put this in terms you can understand: (words to a cool 80's song) "One thing, leads to another" (there is a nice drum sequence between "thing" and "leads"; just thought you should know). <br>   ALSO, lots of new scientific info has come along since Pasteur and Co., and a guy at a university somewhere around Chicago seems to have conducted an experiment that illustrates how the amino acids necessary for life came about. <br>  BUT BE OF GOOD CHEER, a wise guy once said, cause evolution and religion aren't really incompatible. when religious folks finally learn to tell the difference between prose and poetry, and literal vs. figurative, they will finally see things in a less childish way and start arguing about things that are more important: like, does heaven have a waiting list for those busy days when lots of christians die?

That is your gross misstatement of both the Bible and of historical Chrsitianity.  <br>  <br>  The world is creation.  It would be viewed as an institution of Common Grace.  Truth would be contained within the world.  Christians are called to a dual citizenship in the kingdom of God an the kingdom of man.  The Bible would claim on matters of ultimate truth, that the Bible itself is the final container of that.  That is completely different than saying that all truth is in the Bible.  Paul makes this very clear in Romans, and there are many other examples as well.  <br>  <br>  Also, please be precise when using contradiction.  Contradiction is something that violates the law of non-contradiction, that is something can not be both a and not a at the same time and in the same relationship.  Variations and anomalies are in fact, not contradictions.  <br>  <br>  And quite honestly, I know of no REPUTABLE Christian that would say what you have said.  <br>  <br>  Also, the doctrine of inerrancy, which I think you are attacking, is referring to the autographs, the ORIGINAL copies as being inerrant.  We do not hold that the current manuscripts are perfect, but we do hold, and have excellent evidence to support this, that the changes are not significant and do not effect any significant doctrine.<br>  Soli Deo Gloria|`|tOh85To7aa	There are still millions who think the Bible is not true,but just wait a little longer then you will all know the Bible is true when you are running and looking for a hiding place from what God is going to unleash upon this whole world,that's Bible!

Atheism is a wonderful way of life because there is no fantasy, no judging other atheists about whether they are TRUE atheists or not, and we all are in the same boat.

LdExmo6taa	There is an evil spirit that has been bothering you. If you are a born-again Christian, all you have to do is tell it to get out and not come back, in the Name of Jesus. It must obey and leave.<br>  <br>  If you have been involved in anything of an occult nature - ouija, seances, practicing or playing with magic, terot cards, etc. you will have to renounce those activities and ask Jesus to forgive you for participating in them, or the spirit has a right to stay and you can't get rid of it.<br>  <br>  In the Bible (Luke 10:19) Jesus says, "I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions and to defeat the power of your enemy Satan. Nothing can harm you."

aqPWNeSeaa	I think you're probably right.  I don't think that it's possible to say with certainty that you will never, under any circumstances, be attracted to someone of the opposite sex even if you consider yourself to be gay.<br>  <br>  With that being said, though, it might be true that you couldn't see yourself having a committed relationship/being sexually intimate/doing whatever else with a certain gender.<br>  <br>  I think that we'd probably all be better off if we didn't feel pressured to label ourselves so strictly.|`|kNWevwzUaa	yes...

Some ppl really aren't attracted to anyone of the opposite sex, and many ppl are not attracted to anyone of the same sex. Just because it has become more socially accepted to explore the idea, does not make one bisexual. It's one thing to think about it or talk about it, it's another to actually have sex with someone or fall in love with someone, who is of the same gender. It still isn't very socially accepted in the US to be a bi male either. I'm bi, but it took a long time to figure it out (I'm 50). Many ppl in the past married, as that's what we were expected to be, heterosexual. <br>  <br>  Even now, ppl who say they are bi are asked if they are confused, or really gay/lesbian but homophobic or het but just haven't met the right person! Being bi is not any more popular in society than being lesbian or gay, and you really don't fit in well with either "group", as neither one can truly understand your romantic feelings and sexual attractions..but that's just my personal views, others may not share my perspective.<br>  <br>  Edit: Check out the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid to see where you stand on the "bi scale": <a href="http://www.bisexual.org/kleingrid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bisexual.org/kleingrid.html</a><br>  <br>  This has a lot of interesting info about what it means to be bisexual: from a UK Bi group: <a href="http://www.bicommunitynews.co.uk/both_directions.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bicommunitynews.co.uk/both_di...</a>|`|x7uRjwseaa	No, i know a lot of people who are 100% monosexual.|`|RXS9K18Faa	i also think that everyone is at least a little bit bisexual. some more than others but i definitely everyone has a little bisexualness in them|`|XxVTw5U3aa	i think that but some people disagree...<br>  i think it might just be hard for bisexuals to understand why some people only like one gender lol|`|tBXn97NNaa	No, I think it's a gamut and we all fit in somewhere.

I find men attractive.  I am sure there are straight men and women who have thought or wondered what it would be like to be with the same sex, but to act upon it and actually want to do more than experimenting is based upon the person.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	I think yeah everyone is bisexual.

4Te5gVvDaa	I'm black and I wouldn't have taken offense to it. However, here in America most blacks have been overly sensitized to racial humor and stubbornly categorize such wit as racism. Whenever I happen to be around my friends and their girlfriends I often notice that they often loosely banter racial, sexist, and national jokes. Most of my friends are white and Asians though. I have heard that Germany is much more accepting of people then America and your tact may not be as discreet or humorous here unfortunately.America is still a sect of uptight minorities and racist that are seeking some sense of vindication. You're not at fault here he is just not accustomed to such liberal humor. Help him breakout of that shell.|`|XyEUCeIvaa	whoa that was kinda really harsh and mean|`|m5O8ogFHaa	Hes just being touchy! If i was married to someone (and even just my friends) we feel comfortable enough with eachother to joke about anything inc race... I think your husband is being sensitive, he may have been teased about his skin before. You are going to need to ask him .|`|2DahzSWvaa	Whoa, that was messed up. He's also a punk to sit around, and let people make fun of him like that. You picked a winner. *sarcasm*|`|va3Ysr8vaa	you just have to see how other people react|`|RPoFBenJaa	I think its a combo of both. I am german as well, and so I would never make a comment like that because people would think I said it just because im german. Also, Im not racist. Im not saying you are but I do think it was kind of tacky. Sometimes we think things in our own head that we think is witty but others find it immoral. I don't think you were necessarily trying to be mean or racist, just uneducated about a witty comment. Play it safe and ignore conversation that will get you into trouble.|`|AA11256693	No, that was tacky and offensive and you should apologize. <br>  Any time you single out a specific trait in a negative light, whether it is color, or whatever, you shine a big spot light as if saying to other's, "look at the differences here".  It isn't right.|`|c1D5vJBmaa	Why would you want to joke like that with the love of your life? If anything, being humiliated by your own wife in front others is hurting and embarrassing. You should definitely be ashamed of yourself. Apologize to him, and don't let it happen again.|`|vAx9bLL1aa	i dont see anything wrong with it at all.<br>  but some people are more sensitive and you should just be more careful, now that you know your husband doesnt find your humor funny, just try and stay away of any topics that could llead to color issues.|`|gtKkCAAkaa	being black myself, if i was married to someone who said that i think it would be a little immature to say something like that. And could see how after 4 years of marrige, he would get upset. tell him ur sorry, and it was an immature joke.|`|a1hevOG2aa	It was kind of a tacky joke, but he's taking it too personally.  Racial jokes are like blonde jokes, don't take them seriously, they're just for laughs.  Apologize, but tell him not to be so sensitive.|`|uQlD1Zffaa	I think it's clear your not racist or you wouldn't be married to a black man, tell him to chill out and let him know you didn't mean to offend him.|`|1XGd1MHjaa	nah you're right, but sometimes you just have to learn to shut your mouth in certain situations.
mfSp38yzaa	I challenge you to find ANY religion that some other religion doesn't hate. You can't because it doesn't exist. I agree that it's stupid to HATE an entire group just because they don't agree with you (it's one thing to debate the differences, and another to condemn the believers), but you see it here everyday.|`|AA11923447	Where I'm from, many people respect the Bahá'í Faith. It could be that you're looking too closely at YouTube and other online commentary, which doesn't always attract the greatest thinkers of our age. I'm a Christian, and I respect the Bahá'ís. I have friends who belong to this faith. I have a book of Bahá'í prayers, and I've used it on many occasions.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Most people don't even know what it is. It's like trying to talk to someone about falun gong.|`|GF1NPlBSaa	I don't think most people hate the Baha'i Faith; I think it's simply a quirk of the internet medium.  I see it as a conglomeration of a couple of issues:<br>  <br>  1) Naivety.  Most people are not familiar with the Faith, and some approach it with fear and hostility instead of intellectual curiosity.  In its baser forms, Naivety becomes ignorance, then willful ignorance, and that begets hostility.<br>  <br>  2) The Faith is revolutionary in its religious ideas, and challenges some of the central ideas that humans have placed upon other major religions such as Christianity and Islam.  That can be threatening to adherents of other religions who see theirs as the perfect, "final" religion.  Taken to extremes this leads Christians to see Baha'is as the anti-Christ movement and to Muslims as heretical challengers to Muhammed's claim as Seal of the Prophets.<br>  <br>  3) The anonymity of the Internet emboldens people to say some ignorant, hateful, vicious things because they can get away with it.  99% of the people here wouldn't say those things to your face.  The internet is also full of immature teenagers and troublemakers who have nothing better to do with their time.<br>  <br>  Do not let the hatred you see discourage you.  As Iran is finding out, attempts to eradicate the Baha'is only lead to further dissemination of our message.  And remember what 'Abdu'l-Baha has said:  "Pollute not your tongues by speaking evil of another. Recognize your enemies as friends, and consider those who wish you evil as the wishers of good. ...You must consider your enemies as your friends, look upon your evil-wishers as your well-wishers and treat them accordingly. Act in such a way that your heart may be free from hatred. Let not your heart be offended with anyone. If some one commits an error and wrong toward you, you must instantly forgive him."

Qc6MqcpWaa	To me, gratitude is appreciation for having this life, for all the people I've encountered, and for all the experiences I've had. I'm grateful even for all the hard, trying times, because they've built my character and I believe that everything happens for a reason. I'm grateful for every single person who's upset me, questioned me, or debated me, because it's either set me straight when I was out of line or made me think about something I never payed much attention to. I'm grateful for the chance to prove myself and make something of myself. I'm grateful for the chance to change some aspect of this world, even if it's in a very little way. I'm grateful for every time I was in some sort of pain, because it's made me stronger. I'm grateful for my friends and family and pets, who have loved me unconditionally even when I'm being embarrassing or irrational or a flat out jerk. I'm grateful for every opportunity that has come knocking at my door, because whether I have taken it or turned it down, it has taught me something. I'm grateful for every time somebody made me do something I feared or dreaded doing, because it taught me to be more courageous. I'm grateful for every time I went berserk over something insignificant, because it eventually put life into perspective for me. I'm grateful for music, a good game of baseball or hockey, every steaming cup of coffee, and every sunny day. I'm grateful for all the theists who have tried to change my beliefs, because they have made me think to the point where I became even more sure of my beliefs. I'm grateful for all the knowledge I've gained, because whether I thought it was worthless at the time or not, somebody took the time out their life to discover it for me. I'm grateful for the job that I have, because as much as I may complain about it, it made me understand the value of money and more importantly, how incredibly irritating it is when customers walk in 5 minutes before you close so that I will never do that again. It has also taught me to tip every waiter/waitress/cashier -- including those at McD's -- whether or not they were polite to me, because hopefully it will make them appreciate something in turn. I'm grateful for every chance I have to help somebody out, and every chance I have to inform somebody of something. I'm grateful for every movie, book, person, story, or quote that has touched me in some way, and especially those that moved me to tears. I'm grateful for every living thing that has blessed this planet, which is why I am a vegetarian. I'm grateful that you asked me this question because it helped me find out more about myself.

This is the instruction we need to take to heart today. Many of you are convinced that the precious treasure of the kingdom of God and of Jesus Christ is in the Bible which you hold in your hand. You know that no earthly treasure is attainable without painstaking effort. Why should you expect to understand the treasures of the word of God without diligently searching the Scriptures?<br>  <br>       It is proper and right to read the Bible; but your duty does not end there; for you are to search its pages for yourselves. The knowledge of God is not to be gained without mental effort, without prayer for wisdom in order that you may separate from the pure grain of truth the chaff with which men and Satan have misrepresented the doctrines of truth. Satan and his confederacy of human agents have endeavored to mix the chaff of error with the wheat of truth. We should diligently seek for the hidden treasure, and seek wisdom from heaven in order to separate human inventions from the divine commands. "The "Holy Spirit" will aid the seeker for great and precious truths which relate to the plan of redemption." I would impress upon all the fact that a casual reading of the Scriptures is not enough. We must search, and this means the doing of all the word implies. As the miner eagerly explores the earth to discover its veins of gold, so you are to explore the word of God for the hidden treasure that Satan has so long sought to hide from man. The Lord says, "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching." John 7:17 (R. V.)<br>  <br>       The word of God is truth and light, and is to be a lamp unto your feet, to guide you every step of the way to the gates of the city of God. It is for this reason that Satan has made such desperate efforts to obstruct the path that has been cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. You are not to take your ideas to the Bible, and make your opinions a center around which truth is to revolve. You are to lay aside your ideas at the door of investigation, and with humble, subdued hearts, with self hid in Christ, with earnest prayer, you are to seek wisdom from God. You should feel that you must know the revealed will of God, because it concerns your personal, eternal welfare. The Bible is a directory by which you may know the way to eternal life. You should desire above all things that you may know the will and ways of the Lord. You should not search for the purpose of finding texts of Scripture that you can construe to prove your theories; for the word of God declares that this is wresting the Scriptures to your own destruction. You must empty yourselves of every prejudice, and come in the "spirit of prayer" to the investigation of the word of God.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	When I study my bible, the Holy Spirit who lives inside of me, interprets the bible for me, God speaks that way to His children...|`|13KBWzBXaa	Holy spirit.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	I was in this SAME exact position when I was about 16.  <br>  <br>  I was forced to go through Confirmation, the services of a religion that I simply did not believe in.  I was actually a devout Wiccan and not an atheist at the time, but the bottom line is that my parents forced me to go through with confirmation, even though they knew that I didn't want to do it, I had already found a completely different religion, and even though I told the priest all of that in the little "interview".<br>  <br>  It seemed most ridiculous that I basically took my parents' religion more seriously than they did.  If I DIDN'T take it seriously, then I'd just go through the motions.  If anything, it seemed like taking part in this thing I didn't believe in would be more insulting to the Church than not taking part in it.<br>  <br>  For my mother, Confirmation was nothing more than a coupon for future marriage in the Church.  "You'll need to be confirmed in order to get married in the Church", she'd say.  Then  I explained, "I'm not ever GOING to get married in a Catholic church, because I don't believe in Catholicism!"  Then she'd say "Well you might end up getting engaged to somebody who DOES want to get married in a Catholic Church."  And I'd say "That sounds like a woman I'd never want to date in the first place, let alone marry."<br>  <br>  My parents have long since apologized for having forced me into it.  I think what really made my mother understand is when I said, "Imagine if I forced you to put on a black robe, light colored candles, and stand in a casted Wiccan's circle, then made you recite an invocation to some ancient deity you didn't believe in.  Maybe with a statue right in front of you.  Would you be happy about that?"<br>  <br>  However, I now kind of see their side of the story at the time.  My mother was a CCD teacher, and we lived in a rather small town.  So if I didn't go through confirmation, my parents would have to answer to their friends and their parish, "Why isn't your son being confirmed?"  I still don't think the social pressure justified doing what they did, but I can at least understand why that would have been a factor.  Maybe it's the same with your parents, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Regardless, I think it's utterly wrong to force somebody into a religious service for a religion that they flat-out don't believe in.  Be very firm with the priest and stand your ground.  Tell them how your parents are viewing it as a "last thing you'll ever have to do for the church" and aren't taking it seriously.|`|2R897ziraa	Well i am a Christan and i don't really enjoy hearing that you are of that religion but i have to tell you that if god isn't in your heart and you cant seem to find love in his work then you have to do what makes you happy and maybe one day you will see god as your savior but until then i would just have to tell your parents that you cant and you just have to wait|`|87f3a97394d3a4fe5774bb71ca8eef5caa	simply look at Jesus on the Crucifix, GOD IS LOVE!<br>  <br>  God (Jesus) PROVES to us how much He LOVES us, He suffered and gave His life for us!!!<br>  <br>  OPEN wide your Heart to Christ, pray for FAITH, aks for forgiveness in confession, and be ready to be filled with God's Holy Spirit of LOVE!!!<br>  <br>  Be confirmed in you Catholic Faith, recieve God's LOVE!!!<br>  God bless you ;-)|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I can only think of one reason to go along with the charade.

You should not and cannot be forced against your will to receive a sacrament. It would not be valid. Show this to your parents, your teacher, your priest, even the bishop if necessary:<br>  <br>  “The canon law of the Church requires that the confirmation candidate be able to ‘renew one's baptismal promises’ in order to receive the sacrament. This points out that it is ultimately the recipient's free will decision whether to be confirmed or not. The sacrament is never to be conferred against the will of the student. Only one with a living faith who wishes to be ‘sealed with the Holy Spirit’ can be the recipient of that gift. It should be clear therefore that while young people might rightly be ‘forced’ by their parents to go to classes, they should not be forced to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. This sacrament is ultimately about their relationship with God for which they have to take the responsibility.”<br>  <a href="http://stbrendans.parish.home.comcast.net/~stbrendans.parish/confirmation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://stbrendans.parish.home.comcast.ne...</a>|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	Go, on the basis that you are learning exactly what you are rejecting.

They may try and punish you but who cares. Tell them to stop persecuting you in the name of THEIR religion.

You don't believe therefore being confirmed is disrespectful.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	To do it and not mean it does nothing anyway and you are right, it would be a lie.<br>  <br>  Talk to the Priest,  chance are, if you tell him this, he may not allow you to do it.  <br>  <br>  You can't force accepting Christ Jesus on anyone, it must be a PERSONAL CHOICE.<br>  <br>  BTW - what has made you to make a choice to become an atheist?  I am just curious.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Tell your priest or catechist. They may be able to over rule your parents. You shouldn't have to lie to the Church and the people to make your folks happy.

GBKaftrJaa	First I will attempt to assure you that I myself have no problem with 2 consenting adult gay people marrying each other.<br>  <br>  That being said what is compared is not "free will" but "sin".  The bible states that gay sex is sinful.  The bible states that murder is sinful.  And the bible states that all sins are equal.  The bible says murder is no worse than the "innocent" white lie.  It says we are all sinners.  And where "free will" comes into the discussion is, for example I may be born ready to have sex with every man that walks the planet, ha ha, but I have free will to not have sex with any of them.  My natural inclination would be to do whatever I want.<br>  <br>  So, honestly I don't know what the big issue is about allowing or not allowing gay marriages.  It's just no concern of mine.  What bothers me is when I hear that a gay person wasn't allowed to see their dying partner in the hospital because they aren't a "relative". It also bothers me that a gay person can't put their partner on their health insurance the way a man can put me on his insurance.<br>  <br>  And they aren't doing the gay marriage cause any good when on my soap (All My Children) they just had a gay marriage and the marriage was dissolved in less than 24 hours with one bride saying "I don't think I ever loved you"  UGH!  I was thinking I am SURE there must be gay people that can STAY in a relationship.  I thought they were trying to help people sympathize with gay people not being allowed to marry then they went the opposite direction and made the gay couple look too irrisponsible to be married.  ugh.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Those who promote the anti-gay agenda will do and say anything to justify homophobia.  Even a child knows that letting two people in love marry is not the same as murder.  Unrepentant homophobes have a goal of destroying gay families--nothing they say surprises me.  It only saddens me that they themselves believe it.  Homophobia is a sin and those caught up in this affliction need to repent and turn from this sin before they harm more gay people.|`|9klx10iKaa	At some point you knew homosexuality was wrong, you still made that choice, just the same as the guy that took a life even though he understood it was wrong. Don't take what I am saying out of context, you asked about free will.<br>  <br>  We all understand that society has a moral code that may be in line with ours or very from ours. Sometimes I exceed the speed limit, I am willing to pay that fine.|`|FarsCSY1aa	Well these people don't see gays as people anyway. Ignorant bigots.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	It has nothing to do with either murder or homosexuality. Your argument was that some laws are wrong because they prohibit free will.<br>  <br>  Your argument was: Laws against gay marriage are wrong because they are a violation of free will.<br>  <br>  By the way, gay marriage is something I feel very strongly about. I have repeatedly voted to strike down gay marriage bans, I am active in ACLU and Libertarian party. I support gay marriage 100%. But your reasoning is fallacious - banning gay marriage is not a violation of free will any more than banning any form of behavior is a violation of free will.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense at all? Nobody was comparing gay marriage to murder. They were addressing your free will argument, not gay marriage. If you had left off the part about free will, no one would have mentioned murder. But you argued that laws against certain behaviors were a violation of free will, and that (ergo) Christians who believe in free will cannot support laws against certain behaviors.<br>  <br>  Oh - I get it. You are confused about the term "free will." That is why you are getting responses that don't seem to make sense. Free will is a theological term that refers to the ability to choose. It is not freedom to act, it is the abstract idea of choice itself.|`|R1WapAO6aa	The thing is, they can't (or atleast the ones that think this) understand that homosexuality isn't a choice. It's really simple, just like how i get turned on when i see a beautiful woman, a homosexual man gets turned on by seeing a handsome man. Technically it's a choice to have a heterosexual lifestyle or a homosexual life, but in their mind, they're still gay and you can't change that.|`|XqpRYh52aa	You haven't met my mother-in-law|`|7F57Ovlfaa	what dose being gay have to do with murder|`|04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	some marriages do end up in death...sad|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	What are you talking about? Free will exists, both these things are evil decisions.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Christians cannot and will not encourage sinful behavior.<br>  Homosexuals define who they are by their sexual urges.<br>  Everybody sins, you must turn from your sin and ask<br>  Gods forgiveness.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is a choice, it may be a hard choice but<br>  still a choice.<br>  Murder is a choice as well, both are sin and both should<br>  be discouraged.

Secondly, It is folly to judge of persons and things by the opinion of men concerning them, and to go down with the stream of vulgar estimate; for that which is highly esteemed among men, who judge according to outward appearance, is perhaps an abomination in the sight of God, who sees things as they are, and whose judgment, we are sure, is according to truth.

7ce29aaaa2e67395ec835e75e3a79530aa	The current fight for gay marriage has nothing to do with any church or religion. We are trying to get civil marriage. All couples are required to apply for a civil license for marriage regardless of where it is preformed or by whomever it is officiated.  Religious and civil marriages have all the same rights under the individual state laws as well as the federal laws because a religious marriage is a civil marriage granted by the state in which you received the marriage license. <br>  Civil Unions are a completely different thing. They are not recognized by the federal government nor do they transfer from state to state. There are also same sex partnership registries in different cities throughout the USA but they don't even apply to state marriage rights nor are they recognized by the federal government. If you look into marriage rights you will find each state grants over 100 rights to married couples that are not granted to couples that don't have that piece of paper in their hands. <br>  Imagine your partner becoming ill and not being allowed to visit her because you are not a blood relative nor do you have a marriage license. What if you choose to have or adopt children ( which by the way many states do not allow same sex couples to do ) and you can't pick up the child from school when they become ill and the bio parent isn't available. You can't file taxes as a couple to receive tax breaks, you can lose everything you and your partner own if they die without a will or if the bio family contests the will. <br>  There many things automatically granted to married couples that are not available to you simply because you want to love and commit to someone of the same gender. <br>  We are fighting for marriage for many many reasons, one of which is to be treated equal to everyone else. Recognizing our relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships is the right thing to do. Our country has already proved that equal but different is never equal or fair. Our being treated as second class citizens is no less wrong than any other minority group being considered second class.|`|rh2cRpMHaa	Because, despite being gay, I am still Christian.

However, if a church supports gay people marrying, why should that church be overridden by the rules of a church that doesn't?
3XLAs6Isaa	G-d punished the Jews with the 2nd Diaspora because of the senseless hatred within the Jewish community. This hatred (basically intense in-fighting) was responsible for the destruction of the 2nd Temple, and the subsequent exile of the Jews. So, to answer your 1st question...yes, the 2nd exile is the same as the Diaspora...at least I think that was your question...;)<br>  <br>  Mainstream Judaism (and that consists of Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and many of what people call "Ultra" Orthodox) do not object to the Zionist idea as it exists today. The Jews that do outright reject Zionism (the ones you see demonstrating with the Palestinians, the ones that joined the president of Iran at his Holocaust denial conference) have been condemned by the Jewish community. They are a tiny fringe group, and do not in any way represent the views of world Jewry.<br>  <br>  Most Jews agree that a Jewish nation, similar to the biblical Jewish kingdom, where G-d's law is the law of the land, can only exist once the Messiah has come. Whether Jews can BE in the land before that is a different story.

What they deny is mental illness. And while, in some ways, that is just as bad, there are very few instances in someone's life where they might die if they don't receive immediate psychiatric help. It happens. But it's FAR less common than needing immediate physical help.<br>  <br>  The other religions you are referring to are Christian Science, which denies all medical care, and Jehovah's Witnesses, who deny blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  And yes, I do think they should be banned from parenting. If they want to let themselves die from simple medical problems, that's fine with me - but they shouldn't be allowed to make martyrs of their children.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To those saying it is already illegal, you are wrong. There are many states that have "religious exemption" laws, which have, in some cases, been extended to allowing parents to deny their children life-saving medical care because of religious conflicts.<br>  <br>  It's insane. But it's true.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://whatstheharm.net/christianscience.html" rel="nofollow">http://whatstheharm.net/christianscience...</a>
GBKaftrJaa	The catholic bibles have the apocryphal books that were not considered canon by any other religion than Catholics so not included in the other bibles.<br>  <br>  In the rest of the bibles they all have the same books.  The King James Version that some will recommend is the least accurate version as it comes from scrolls of the bible dating no earlier than the 10th century.<br>  <br>  <br>  After the older scrolls were found (the dead sea scrolls were found around 1945) that date as early as 200AD, all the other versions of the bible were written based on the earlier scrolls.  So read any bible that is translated into modern English so you can understand what you are reading.<br>  <br>  Here is a web site where you can look at passages in any version of the bible so you can see which translation you like.  But since you have 2 of them right in front of you, I'd recommend reading what you have so that you at least get started until you can get out and buy one that you'd like better.<br>  <br>  And most bibles are generic.

The difference in the Catholic and Protestant Bibles arose in the following manner: The Jews living in the few centuries before Christ were divided into two groups-- the Jews dwelling in Palestine and speaking Hebrew and the large number of Jews scattered throughtout the Roman Empire and speaking the Greek language, a consequence of the conquest of Alexander the Great of Greece.<br>  <br>   In the several centuries before the coming of Chirst, the Hews in Palestine re-examined and eliminated some of the books from the existing collection as not in harmony with the Law of Moses and as of doubtful inspiration. The Pharisees set up four criteria which their scared books had to pass in order to be included in the revised Jewish canon: 1) They had to be in harmony with the Pentateuch (Torah or Law); 2) They had to have been written before the time of Ezra; 3) They had to written in Hebrew; 4) They had to have been written in Palestine. <br>  <br>  The application of these arbitrary criteria eliminated Judith, probably written in Aramaic, Wisdom and 2 Maccabees, written in Greek; Tobit and parts of Daniel and Esther, written in Aramaic and probably outside of Palestine; Baruch, written outside of Palestine; and Sirach and 1 Maccabees, written after the time of Ezra. <br>  <br>  By the 1st century after Christ, this revised canon was generally accepted by all Jews. From the earliest times, the Chirstian Church recognized the Jewish canon of the Greek-Roman Tradition, or Alexandrine canon, as being the true Bible. Jesus Himself quoted from this Bible and not until the Reformation was this canon seriously challenged. <br>  <br>  These seven disputed books are also called the deuterocanonical books, while the rest of the books of the Old Testament comprise the protocanonoical books. By protocanonical books is mean the "books of the first canon" books of the Old Testament accepted by both Christians and Jews. The dueterocanonical books "books of the second canon" are those seven books found only in the Catholic canon. Luther rejected the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament. At one time he also eliminated Hewbrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse from the New Testament, but later Protestants reinserted them. Today the Catholic and Protesant New Testament books are identical.<br>  <br>  You asked so there it is. The Catholic version of the Bible comes from the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible. The best English translation you will find is the Douay-Rheims that is a translation of the original Latin Vulgate.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	1)There is Catholic and Non-Catholic.

Those "extra" books were there for over a thousand years and it wasn't until the middle ages that they were removed by some who had personal agendas with the church!

Technically, they are both Christian Bibles.<br>  There are many translations. The King James Version was translated in 1611, and is held in high esteem by several, particularly conservative, denominations. It has fallen from use in recent decades for two reasons: There are many more options, and no one speaks 16th century English anymore.<br>  Two excellent translations are the New International Version, which was translated by a group of theologians and Biblcal experts from a variety of denominations, and the New King James Version, which is the King James Version updated to present day English..|`|3QGv54ynaa	Not sure the exact difference, but Catholics pray and worship to Mary and Christians Pray and worship to Jesus. Catholics go to confessions, confirmation classes and have communions. Christians tend to have more open classes and discussions about the Bible and their questions and opinions, and confirmation and confession isn't required. This would be a good question for a Pastor or Priest because you will be able to get exact and factual answers to your specific questions.

I have some Wiccan friends, and I love them to death. I really respect their religion, and everything they tell me about it. It seems very peaceful and spiritual, almost like what I've heard of some old Native American religons. However, like any religion, I believe that fanatics can take Wicca to a horrible extreme. <br>  <br>  In a town I used to live in, there was this huge scandal a few years back where a group of self-proclaimed Wiccans performed a baby human sacrifice. Of course, this is atrocious, and what I've heard about Wicca, there's nothing that promotes human sacrifice. This travesty made many people in my old town really fearful and angry towards Wiccans, but I was little when it all happened, so I escaped some of the prejudiced feelings. However, my mother has told me enough, with terrifying stories of Wiccans-gone-bad, that I am still slightly wary of Wiccans I do not know well. <br>  <br>  Than again, didn't many Americans feel the same way towards Muslims right after 9/11? <br>  <br>  I believe that any religion can be formed to fit with the deranged ideas of the sick-minded, but as a Muslim friend of mine said, these people who kill are not Muslims, Christians, or in this case, Wiccans. They are a-religious. They want to kill, and they will find a way to do so, twisting a peaceful religion like Wicca, with its natural center towards one of murder. <br>  <br>  To wrap up my rather long-winded explanation, I believe that when handled correctly, Wicca can be a beautiful thing. With it, many people are able to find an incredible source of beauty and harmony. <br>  <br>  As a Christian, of course, I believe that the only way to the Father, and to salvation is through Jesus Christ; however, I also believe in a loving Father, who can be worshipped and accepted in many ways, and would never let His children (this includes Wiccans, for those of who have not attended as many Sunday School classes as I have) suffer, because they worshipped with loving hearts towards the wrong name. <br>  <br>  I think C.S. Lewis gave the best example of this. In the last Narnia book (and I'm sorry if I'm giving away spoilers here) a group of people were worshipping a devil-like god, but they were worshipping with love, care, and compassion, helping those in need, and so on. They were like the epitome of good people. There were another group of people who were worshipping the god-like figure, Aslan, but in horrible ways; killing, destroying, and hating. When judgement time came, Aslan accepted those who had worshipped the devil's name with love, explaining that because of their love, they were really worshipping Him. And He rejected those who killed in His name, saying that their hate made them followers of the Devil, no matter whose name they decided to call to. <br>  <br>  Thus, and I can't believe I've written a frickin' novel here, I, a highly religious Christian, am A-OK with Wicca.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	Christians are against practicing it, since the Bible is against it. In Wicca, you worship another God, and since in the Bible, God's first commandment is "Thou shall have no other God's before me.. . . . . ."<br>  I wouldn't practice it, but it is your life to do whatever you want with.|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	I'm not religious, but I think Christians and the like think of it has heathenism and all that jazz.

sjMIFH9Faa	Well that is a major philosophical question and non of us have the answer. I personally don't believe in moral relativism (that ends justify the means), because I believe that it is the means by which we do things which truly define us. This applies to both good or evil acts. <br>  <br>  Lets say I could end world hunger, but I had to enslave and brutally treat a few people. Would that morally justified? I don't think so, because it is the means by which I feed the world that defines the act. <br>  <br>  Now lets say instead of feeding the world, I can dedicate myself to a few hungry people. To do so, I would have to struggle and suffer, but I would be doing a service that is pure. That is without doubt a good act. And if I actually could choose between the two, I would choose the pure act. <br>  <br>  I think we as a culture look to much at the result of our efforts, but we often forget to consider how we reached these results. I think if we did consider the means of how we do the things that we do, I'm sure that we would realize that we hurt many people along the way. <br>  <br>  Even though a man with a large ego may do some good deeds, it is almost inevitable that he will hurt people along the way, and it is that which will define him.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Good is good.

They quickly broad stoke their opponents with "hatred" then claim that they are the victims of such malice.  If they want tolerance they should have some themselves.|`|lnMav7jYaa	Annoying, God does not love gay people he hates them and sentenced them to death and referred to them as an abomination.

He basically said we need to treat each other like equals which is right.
ridu0Rtwaa	The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!<br>  <br>  Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!<br>  <br>  What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|EBGdlo35aa	OK, who...<br>  <br>  over 40 individuals were involved in writing the Scriptures of the bible (exactly how many more than 40 cannot be determined).  It was written over a period of **at least** 600 years!  Some claim as many as 1600 years!  It seems **likely** (from linguistic analysis) that the earliest books were written at least 1000 years before the latest.  SO, a whole bunch of people over a very long period of time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why different versions...<br>  1) Language - modern language keeps changing.  Some words still in use today have very different meanings than they did in the time of the King James Version (KJV), for example.  Witness how, in the KJV Old Testament (OT), the word "meat" is used to refer to bread and the word "bread" is used to refer to meat!  This is just one of the most obvious of a multitude of such changes in meaning.  Modern translations ensure comprehension by modern readers.<br>  2) Source texts - archaeologists are continually making discoveries of more ancient, and more authentic, source texts.  There is *still* no version that takes full advantage of the texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, and they were first discovered over 50 years ago.  Modern, scholarly translations take advantage of the most recent and most authoritative source texts available.<br>  3) Scholarship - the knowledge of translating the ancient source manuscripts increases with time.  Thus, a modern, scholarly translation is bound to be more consistently accurate than a scholarly translation of 400 years ago, or even 100 years ago.<br>  4) Translation methodology is important.  Style ranges from a word-for-word literal translation (which tends to inaccuracies but is useful in study), to a thought-for-thought translation (which tends to be accurate but often displays over-interpretation as well as translation).  There is a world of "gray area" between these two extremes.<br>  5) Content - though some versions strive for an "inclusive" canon, i.e. a bible that contains all books used by all major Christian sects, most display a very strong religious bias by including only a more restrictive canon.  This can be seen by comparing the contents of the New American Standard Bible (restrictive canon) with the Oxford Annotated New Revised Standard Version (inclusive canon).<br>  6) $ - this is the most significant contributor to the many versions available today.  Any publisher that produces a modern, scholarly translation can expect to earn a profit from publishing that work.  Thus, publishers are continually producing such works in an effort to fill a niche in one of the above areas or simply in offering an improved (modernized) bible to replace a currently-filled niche.  If producing a new version were a money-losing proposition, only a very few well-funded religious or university organizations would be making the financial effort to produce such works.  We would likely have no more than 4 new translations every century under such cost-prohibitive conditions.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|4314a5c895f1d7a06a2b829dca77045faa	I am currently taking a survey of Old Testament course at a reputable university, from what we are being taught there are actually quite a few writers of the bible over a long period of time. If one actually reads the bible, they might find many instances where the name of god changes from chapter to chapter or a verse or idea is stated more than once. Though many claim that the entire bible was written through the holy spirit, we fail to take into consideration the history of the bible. This history contains a long oral Hebrew tradition, which was transcribed much later, then translated to Latin, then translated into other languages. Throughout this period of human tampering, wars were fought and books were added or omitted. Therefore, we have many versions or "canons" of the Holy Bible. Who knows which one was supposed to be the template.|`|HUePP83xaa	The bible was written by Catholic monks inspired by the holy spirit. As the church split to protestants and catholics different churches changed different things to suit their beliefs and to define themselves from other churches. The main versions are the king james, and the one used by the roman and eastern orthadox catholic churches, whch is the most complete, having two more books in the old testament than that of the king james|`|JXfGHsF6aa	"The Holy Ghost!"<br>  <br>  2Pe 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the "Holy Ghost."<br>  <br>    From the beginning, God has been working by His Holy Spirit through human instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose in behalf of the fallen race. This was manifest in the lives of the patriarchs. To the church in the wilderness also, in the time of Moses, God gave His "good Spirit to instruct them" (Neh. 9:20). And in the days of the apostles He wrought mightily for His church through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The same power that sustained the patriarchs. . . and that made the work of the apostolic church effective, has upheld God's faithful children in every succeeding age. It was through the power of the Holy Spirit that during the Dark Ages the Waldensian Christians helped to prepare the way for the Reformation. It was the same power that made successful the efforts of the noble men and women who pioneered the way for the establishment of modern missions.<br>  <br>       Today the heralds of the cross are. . . preparing the way for the second advent of Christ. . . . And as they continue to let their light shine, as did those who were baptized with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, they receive more and still more of the Spirit's power. Thus the earth is to be lightened with the glory of God.|`|DHxOmKzTaa	The Bible that we know (The King James Version) was written by MAN.. Man proclaimed devinedirection of course. Much like David Coresh and 1 million lunatics before him. <br>  <br>  The Bible was a borrowed religion from the Egyptians. Read my question I posted Just moments ago  " Do Youi Know Horus?? Bible Borrowed?? "  <br>  <br>  1280 years before Christ was born the Egyptian Book Of The Dead was written.. Horus is the Jesus figure and does all of the things that Jesus claimed to do.. Only 1280 earlier.. A borrowed text from a people without a land. So they killed and pillaged thier way into a land and a religion..|`|YIuKqY2taa	The Bible was written by a collection of men who were inspired to write the words over the course of 1200 years. There are different "versions" for two reasons.<br>  <br>  First, the "traditional" Bible has 66 books that all Christians will agree were inspired by God. First, they are consistent across all transcripts that have been found. Also, the books do not contradict each other. The books also reference each other as sources of inspired truth.<br>  <br>  The Catholic BIble has several other books that Protestant scholars do not recognize as inspired. The books are not referenced by the traditional Bible (nor any events or authors). Their historical evidence is in question as to accuracy and time frame.<br>  <br>  There are different translations - the Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. To translate those three languages is a huge task that takes a lot of time, study, and consideration. The early translations were written in the language of the day - the King James Version - what you and I would recognize as Shakespearean and very difficult to understand unless you really study it. Then there are other versions that include updated English like the New King James, which is like the old King James but does not include any thee's and thou's. No translation is wrong, its often a matter of personal taste.
aJL5BTCDaa	Ask God. We as deathly obtuse humans cannot do anything and succeed without God's help. I can't tell you "Yes, break up with him," or "No, he's a keeper," without having it in my conscience that either answer could be wrong. God, however, knows beginning to end, because He IS the beginning and the end. He's forever.<br>  <br>  God bless you, and I'll be praying you will make the right decision with God by your side. Blessings.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	You know, if that is SO important to you, and you knew it was a deal breaker for you, then why didn't you make sure he was a believer in the first place?<br>  <br>  Seems like there are probably other reasons that you want out, and are just too afraid to admit. Are you fairly young? Maybe he's nice, and you love him, but your not IN love with him? Maybe things aren't really bad, but they aren't really good either.<br>  <br>  That might mean that just because things aren't particularly bad, you don't think have a good reason to break up with him, hence the looking for any stupid excuse to get rid of him.<br>  <br>  Stop being a coward and address what the REAL issue is. If you just don't think he's the one, let him go and tell him that's what's up. Then go to church and find a man.<br>  <br>  Don't hand him some stupid excuse, and blame your religious beliefs for your lack of back bone.|`|4NcshCDvaa	Why dont you talk to him and help him become a real Christian, sit him down and study with him. <br>  <br>  Help him get stronger in his faith.

I'm sorry but this would make me highly skeptical about the genuineness or faithfulness of a person towards the relationship itself, let alone their religious convictions if I was in your shoes and the tables were flipped. This isn't an easy decision - marriage is not an easy choice or an easy road (it is not all roses and rainbows, no matter how beatific people want to make it - it takes hard work, faithfulness, honesty, and sacrifice). I hope you're not one of those young women who looks to Hollywood celebrities for your source of relationship advice or role models. If you love him, have a true heart-to-heart with him and let him know how YOU feel about YOUR Lord and Savior and how much that is important to YOU. If he can't respect or appreciate that and still maintain a relationship with you, knowing that God should come first, then pray about it, most likely end it and move on. I think you both need to have a solid understanding of the financial, emotional, psychological, and personal maturity that needs to have a firm foundation before entering into any kind of serious relationship let alone marriage. There are certain traits and values in a spouse you should be seeking out and before you make that leap with this fellow, I highly suggest reputable, church-based marriage counseling first. I'm not going to quote Scripture to you about what is said on wedding believers to unbelievers, but you do need to make sure you KNOW who this guy is, what he is all about, and how he really feels about you.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Help?

Ieqp1kIhaa	Dear,<br>  <br>  Peace be upon you.<br>  <br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.<br>  <br>  Lets go to the terminology of "FITNAH".<br>  Means:- libel, slander, defamation, published false statement that damages a person's reputation; act of publishing it; crime of uttering this.<br>  <br>  In Islam it goes more to attack the good reputation or defame.<br>  <br>  The "FITNAH" in the Islamic religion goes to a unmarried couple when they were together without the present of Muhrim of the girl/lady/woman. This will lead to Khalwat, though nothing of the kind was done. Though they are sincere. The accusation/allegation/thing alleged/imputation on sexuality although it was not real.<br>  <br>  Therefore avoid being together as couple in any lonely places at in any situation or condition.<br>  <br>  Islam means submitting one own self to Al-Mighty God Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala is "THE FAITH" of which Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.<br>  <br>  Muslims believe in ONE God, Al-Mighty God Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala the creator, the governor of the universe. Creates Jinns and mankind to worship HIM and make mankind as Agent (Khalifah) on earth. Only one God. Allah is One. the Eternal God. HE begot none,   nor was HE begotten.  None is equal to HIM.<br>  <br>  Wabillahhitaufiq Walhidayah Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahhi Wabarakatuh.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Fitna is cofusion/chaos/strife|`|iCMrsV9daa	In the Islamic tradition, trials or temptations that test the unity of the Muslim community. The term may be used to describe insurrection or civil warfare or, more specifically, to define a tribunal over doctrinal issues, broadly similar to the Christian Inquisition. <br>  <br>  There were four fitnahs in the early history of Islam. The first (656 – 661) followed the murder of the third caliph, 'Uthman ibn 'Affan. It brought up the question of 'Ali's right to rule and prompted a military conflict that eventually resulted in the schism between the Sunnite and the Shi'ite branches. <br>  <br>  The second coincided with the caliphate of Yazid I (680 – 683); it was a continuation of the struggle between claimants to the caliphate and led to the death of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali at the Battle of Karbala' — another formative event in the Sunnite-Shi'ite split. <br>  <br>  The third fitnah (744 – 750) resulted in the ascendancy of the 'Abbasid dynasty. The fourth evolved from the caliphate's support for the Mu'tazilite theological school and successfully challenged the caliph's authority to enforce doctrinal rigour.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Fitnah means "Trouble", Trouble maker, Conspiracy etc.<br>  <br>  Something that is meant to divide people and create differences or make them deviate.|`|fN6eDrFKaa	fitnah is temptations. <br>  which can lead to corruption of society,morality and also health hazards.|`|mOWyzwubaa	like talibans,they are fitnah
AA11135281	Depends upon what you believe.  Those who believe the Christian scriptures say that God caused Mary to become pregnant without sexual intercourse taking place.  Skeptics say that Mary was probably impregnated by Joseph and said she was a virgin to avoid being stoned to death, or had sex with someone else and said she was a virgin to avoid losing Joseph as a husband.<br>  <br>  Myself, I don't believe Mary was either a virgin or impregnated by God.  I believe the virgin birth was borrowed from mystery religions that were well known at the time.|`|AA12360579	No; it's impossible for things that don't exist to impregnate someone.<br>  <br>  That's like saying Santa got my mom pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think that either Mary had an affair and wouldn't admit it (as such a thing would've gotten her stoned to death), or Mary and Joseph got it on out of wedlock.

Own religious behaviour is positively correlated with individual life satisfaction. More unusually, average religiosity in the region also has a positive impact: people are more satisfied in more religious regions. This spillover holds both for those who are religious and for those who are not. The flipside of the coin is that a greater proportion of "atheists" (those who say they do not currently belong to any religious denomination) has negative spillover effects, for the religious and atheists alike. We last show that both Protestants and Catholics like to live in regions where their own religion is dominant, while Protestants are also more satisfied when Catholics dominate. The generic positive spillover effect of others' religion is not explained by social capital, crime, or trust.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpot/0410010.html" rel="nofollow">http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpot/0410...</a><br>  <br>  More data, less schollarly<br>  <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110010672" rel="nofollow">http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=...</a><br>  <br>  Americans can be divided into three groups when it comes to religious practice. Surveys indicate that about 30% attend houses of worship at least once per week (I will call them "religious"), while about 20% are "secular"--never attending. The rest attend sometimes, but irregularly. These population dimensions have changed relatively little over the decades: Since the early 1970s, the religious group has not shrunk by more than two or three percentage points.<br>  How do religious Americans compare to the secular when it comes to happiness? In 2004, the General Social Survey asked a sample of Americans, "Would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?" Religious people were more than twice as likely as the secular to say they were "very happy" (43% to 21%). Meanwhile, secular people were nearly three times as likely as the religious to say they were not too happy (21% to 8%). In the same survey, religious people were more than a third more likely than the secular to say they were optimistic about the future (34% to 24%).<br>  <br>  The happiness gap between religious and secular people is not because of money or other personal characteristics. Imagine two people who are identical in every important way--income, education, age, sex, family status, race and political views. The only difference is that the first person is religious; the second is secular. The religious person will still be 21 percentage points more likely than the secular person to say that he or she is very happy.<br>  <br>  Good night.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Religion is healthy.<br>  <br>  Religious people live longer, report higher degrees of happiness, and we get a whole lot more done for others than people who are not religious.

The trick to getting out of the emotional swamp is to just stop. Stop blaming yourself, stop thinking about sad things, stop thinking what ever you're thinking and just relax for a minute. Now think about what the emotion is doing. Is it helping you in anyway? Will the problem go away if you cover yourself in emotion? Probably not. <br>  <br>  However, there's always a solution to a problem. If you are too stressed, then talk to people and get some support. Set small goals that you can accomplish to beat your problem. Get a hobby, it helps keep your mind off your problems. Think positive. There's so much more to life than problems. I hope that you can come to the realization that your problem is not worth all the time and emotion. No matter what it is. Move on with your life and be happy!|`|S30Dcsvgaa	Well it is a GLASS case.

Seeing as I'm a freshman, and the school is a women's college I was hoping that there would be a lot of incoming lesbian/bi freshman girls. There was...thank goodness!|`|pVXecnmzaa	I know where you're coming from. I'm gay and in college too and I don't fit into any of the gay cliques here either. <br>  <br>  Like you, most of my friends are straight guys and girls. <br>  <br>  It's a little awkward...|`|QoZVA9Snaa	yes with the ones Ive encountered yes I have a problem with liars,and teasers of any kind.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Actually, it's happen to me. Not just in my college, but in the city as well. I host for a weekly gay and lesbian meeting for the student in my campus. I'm gay, I'm out, and I never thought that being gay is wrong by any means. And those gay people HATED me for being out.<br>  <br>  I personally think that they are jealous because I hang out with straight dudes and have no problem at all in the world. <br>  <br>  Maybe they are actually jealous of you too. So, perhaps, a smile when they come?|`|U5A8JQ1paa	i do, but i'm a little socially awkward so thats another story<br>  <br>  all the girls are cool, but i don't want to get close for the fear that they might share my secrets
aZ2cTa0Uaa	Maybe he's just happier having you without all the legal issues and "pain" of being wed.<br>  <br>  You might suggest being ceremoniously wed but not legally.  That takes the government out of your relationship, and he might be more comfortable with two seperate entities living commited to each other privately.<br>  <br>  Also, YOU might do the proposing.  If you want it bad enough, take a chance and tell him you KNOW it will work between you - ask him to marry you.|`|cfduV3xbaa	Just wait!!!!!! If he loves you it will come eventually...|`|31wLng1yaa	maybe he doesnt think ur the one or<br>  <br>  <br>  he wants to do it when u last expect it|`|M3SUulHfaa	I personally don't think he's the right one for you (or you for him).  I believe it's possible to love someone without them being the "one" because I went through it myself.<br>  <br>  My advice to anyone who has not gotten married after 3 years, or has walked out at any point due to not knowing what their feelings are for the other person, is to break it off.  Otherwise you might just end up divorced.  <br>  <br>  When you meet the right person, there is no question of it.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	what  the  heck is  that  about? <br>  <br>  you  told  him  you  want  him  to  propose  to  you?<br>  <br>  why  havent  you  proposed  to  him? and  whats  stopping  you from  sticking  your  neck out  and  buying  the  ring  for him.  <br>  <br>  you left  him  once  already.  hes  probably gun shy.<br>  <br>   why should  he only commit to you  .  why  dont  you  approach it  as  a  couple  and  go  choose  matching  rings together  ?|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Maybe he's the right guy for you, but you don't really seem right for him. You traded him in early on because you didn't think he was right. Then last year you ordered a proposal to be delivered in December. Now you want to leave him because of no ring. How about just appreciating what you have now? <br>  It sounds like you're more interested in having an engagement ring and a commitment that in your relationship with this man. He might sense that and is in no hurry to bond himself for life to someone who isn't really interested in him as a person.<br>  When he's ready, he'll propose. Or you'll pressure him until he leaves you. Either way, all you can do is wait.

Don't listen to those who try to make jokes about this, because satan dosen't need to try and tempt them. They are already his. Pray for the Holy Spirit to give you strength and read your Bible. When this has happened to me I pray .. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit leave me satan. Sometimes I just whisper this a few times and then I feel so much better.

If he did not want to get into trouble he should not have used a paint ball gun to destroy someone else's property.  He would not like it if he had a car and someone hit it with a paint ball gun or anything else for that matter.  People work hard nowadays to get the things that they have and they cannot go about paying to have someone else fix something that an idiot decided to do because he was bored.

You seem to know quite a bit about the Church already, if you know about President Hinckley.  Get with the missionaries, and learn about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the Church itself, not from its enemies.

God does not condone terrorism, war nor does He take suiciders into Heaven.  That is a myth worth further study.|`|JDxpjT34aa	Most religions have been a reason for some act of terrorism. Think of the inquisition. I'm Catholic but I don't condone what happened with the inquisition. When wars, or horrible atrocities, begin they are started by men, not God, and I don't think God was exactly happy about many of the horrible things that have happened throughout history in His name. But I think it's different when you are at war to defend yourself or others against those who commit terrorism in the name of religion. The average person in the military does not look at war from a religious perspective, they just do their jobs and think more about their fellow Marines or soldiers lives than anything else.|`|U51pBeLfaa	If you don't believe in genocide how can you stop it without fighting a war? I think it is important to stop murder. Why would it be wrong to stop the murder of your friends and family?<br>  <br>  There is the notion of a just war. A war fought on principles, abiding by the Geneva Convention, rather than a war without principles (terrorism), the indiscriminate killing of anyone who gets in your way.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe in murder then you have to stand up for what you believe. This leads to the unpalatable situation of condoning war. The alternative, appeasement, condones murder. If someone side attacks you without principles then it is you choice to defend yourself with the principles of 1 a just war or 2 fight fire with fire or 3 allow evil people to carry on doing evil. Of those three the first one fits in best with my religion.<br>  <br>  Now if you could just get people to be civilized and meet up at a negotiating table and talk through the issues that would be the best solution of all.|`|2nSyfXyBaa	There is nothing in any bible that justifies war or terrorism <br>  none people do this on there own free will and stupidity <br>  Tho shall not kill its there look it up|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Very interesting. <br>  <br>  If an atheist group, under a banner of Atheism started a war with any other group I would be outraged, but would not suddenly start believing in a fairy<br>  <br>  Fortunately atheists are completely decentralized, so this can't happen<br>  <br>  <br>  **Disclaimer** Atheism is not a religion, I just wanted to answer this question because it is interesting.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	Religion has been used to justify war since time immemorial.

Recent wars against Islamic countries or even in media against Islam, made many people curious about it. Before they might have never heard about it.<br>  2. The internet mainly and other means of communication made it easier for non-Muslims to get to know about Islam and Muslims as well could present the real Islam rather than what's published on media.<br>  3. Western countries specially, those who faced either race, religion or financial discrimination found Islam that denounces all that.<br>  4. Countries with religious freedom (after the conservative ages) made it easier for its residents to convert to Islam rather than other countries that such conversion might result in the convert death.<br>  <br>  Many online articles and Youtube videos discuss why people revert to Islam for more details.<br>  <br>  Some would claim that this is because Muslim families continue to make a lot of children. Why is this the case now and not after a disaster like WWII which majority of its victims were non-Muslims? knowing that Muslims follow the preference of having lot of children not only nowadays but since Islam started. It's a fact that Muslims are always increasing, but recently, the converts made a difference.<br>  <br>  Others claim that Muslims are increasing since they can't leave Islam. Why is this fact being highlighted only recently? Any clue how many Muslims really want to leave Islam?

It is a record of the exact words revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It was then dictated to his Companions who memorized it, and it was written down by scribes. The Qur'an is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad fourteen centuries ago. Not one word of its 114 chapters has been changed over the centuries.The Qur'an deals with all subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures. There are also many verses in the Qur'an concerned with natural phenomena that are astounding. It is impossible to explain their presence in humans terms, given the state of knowledge at the time the Qur'an was revealed. In the West, such statements had never before formed the subject of a scientific communication until recent times.On 9th November 1976, an unusual lecture was given at the French Academy of Medicine. Its title was ‘Physiological and Embryological data in the Qur'an' and was delivered by the famous French physician Dr. Maurice Bucaille. His reason for doing this was that "our knowledge of these disciplines is such, that it is impossible to explain how a text produced at the time of the Qur'an could have contained ideas that have only been discovered in modern times."The citations included in this pamphlet appeared in the Qur'an during the 7th century CE. The Prophet Muhammad was himself illiterate and was living among illiterate people. The Arabs at that time worshipped idols and believed in horoscope and magic and were superstitious. The Arabs very actively opposed the teachings advanced by the Prophet through his revelations.This short article is for you to read and to consider. Because the subject matter is so vast, we have space to mention only a few brief facts from the Amazing Qur'an.<br>  <br>  The Creation of the Universe<br>  <br>  "Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (21:30) This verse is specifically addressed to non-believers, and touches upon the creation of the universe and the origins of all life. The Qur'an mentions the existence of a gaseous mass (dukhan,41:11) which is unique and whose elements, although at first fused together (ratq) subsequently became separated (fatq). The separation process resulted in the formation of multiple worlds, a notion which crops up dozens of times in the Qur'an (1:1): "Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds." [1,2]<br>  <br>  The Origins of Life<br>  <br>  "And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (21:30)<br>  <br>  The building blocks of all living things are called cells. They are the basic units of life.<br>  <br>  Protoplasm (cytoplasm + nucleus) is the substance of all living things. Cytoplasm is a jelly-like material consisting of water and dissolved substances. The constitution of protoplasm is about 80-85% water. Without water life is not possible. [2]<br>  <br>  None of the myths on the origins of life that abounded at the time of the Qur'an are present in the text. Furthermore, the fact that all life originated from water would not have been a very easy thing to convince people of 1400 years ago, especially in the desert!<br>  <br>  The Expansion of the Universe<br>  <br>  The expansion of the universe is the most imposing discovery of modern science. Today it is a firmly established concept and the only debate centres around the way this is taking place.<br>  <br>  "The heaven, We have built it with power. Verily, We are expanding it." (51:47)‘We are expanding it' is the translation of the plural present particle musi'una of the verb ausa'a meaning "to make wider, more spacious, to extend, to expand." Some translators were unable to grasp the meaning and provided mistaken translations. Others sense the meaning, but were afraid to commit themselves eg. Hamidullah talks of the widening of the heavens and space, but he includes a question mark. Zidan & Zidan, and The Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs refer to the expansion of the universe in totally unambiguous terms. [1,2]<br>  <br>  The Mountains<br>  <br>  Mountains have always been looked upon as conspicuous landforms, characterized by lofty protrusions above their surroundings, high peaks and steep sides.However, the Qur'an accurately describes mountains as stabilizers for the Earth that hold its outer surface firmly, lest it should shake with us, and as pickets (or pegs) which hold that surface downwardly as a means of fixation."Have we not made the earth an expanse, and the mountains stakes (awtad)?" (78:6-7) and "And God cast into the ground mountains standing so that it does not shake with you." (31:10).

Similarly, accurate knowledge is needed for you to be motivated to believe in God. Studying the Bible can help you to find answers to questions you have.  Jehovah is examining what is hidden in the deepest recesses of our being. Each one should examine his own motive for believing in God. Erroneous beliefs and concepts about God may have contributed to wrong actions in the past. But accurate knowledge of the Bible can lead to a right relationship with the Creator, Jehovah God.—1?Timothy 2:3,?4.<br>  <br>  Through a study of the Bible,we can  acquire, “practical wisdom and thinking ability,” which helps us to “walk in security” in these perilous days. (Proverbs 3:21-23) Think about a personal bible study, it's free. www.watchtower/org|`|CjRfJbncaa	I grew up attending both Sunday school & church, they even gave me my own Bible.

Because ever since March 3rd 1998, I've been searching for a point in my life. That day in March, I went to this party..you know, one of those parties with high power music rockin the house, plenty of booze and endless variations of drugs, and plenty of (well, to put it mildly) shameless girls and drunk boys equals? So I guess I smoked too many joints, and I ended up in the hospital for three weeks. That gave me time to think over life.<br>  <br>  Okay, we are born, grow older, wiser, and each of us develops our own personalities for better or worse. We all try to reach the top of the world and either we do or we spend our lives trying to. Basically we live to have more, always. Don't u see? You wake up, get dressed make yourself look good, go to school come back do your homework, have some fun and to sleep. And it never changes. All right, then u graduate and go to work or raise some kids.<br>  <br>  But it keeps repeating. U know that saying, "History repeats itself?" It does, but then we die. Now for some reason humans spend so much time pondering over every single atom on earth except death.<br>  <br>  I know it scares them. Why wouldn't it? It happens to everyone and no one knows why. Well, MOST people don't know why. But I do. You think all those d*** cruel people who lived on this earth (I can name millions) will get away with everything they did? And those few good will go un-rewarded?<br>  <br>  So anyway we die. We leave behind everything. EVERYTHING. You think that the Porsche u spent your whole life trying to get is going with u? The only things that're going with u are your burial clothes and coffin, if that even.  And there is one other thing, but it's unseen. Your deeds. ALLLL the things u did in this life, good and bad, go with you. And so we're in the grave. What happens to you in the grave is another story but basically your body rots. I mean your "this life" body. The body that we had for (if we are lucky) 80 years is gone and with it our doings!<br>  <br>  Alright so you're out of the picture. Gone. Then, fellow Americans, if we are not here to live life like a party....whats the point? WHY DO WE LIVE?<br>  <br>  Why do so many people commit suicide? Because they never  had the answer to the above question. Some people know. Some. And its man's best kept secret.<br>  <br>  I know what your thinking. "Oh god he's gonna preach us on religion." Not exactly ;)<br>  <br>  It's a WAY OF LIFE, and what if I told u its called ISLAM? I'm Christian. But Christianty is a RELIGION not a WAY OF LIFE. 80% of Americans are "Christians", but sad to say, look at them. Homosexuality, suicide, drugs, adultery, even among their own preachers is common. I should know.<br>  <br>  The old pastor at my church got kicked out for molesting a child. I'm not attacking anyone. I'm saying the facts.  Besides that, it doesn't make sense. Neither do the other million "religions" found on this earth. They all claim to be simple religions, usually claiming belief in one god.<br>  <br>  But they are lacking in on truth, the facts.<br>  <br>  Alright, Aaron get on to your point. Sure. What was my 1st sentence? I'm real mad. Why? Cause everyone knows about Islam. And they ignore it, hide it. Why did I learn everything in school except Islam? From Greek God sh** to Buddha.<br>  <br>  If u read one verse of Islam's book you will believe me. Guaranteed. Because it is the Truth. And its man's best-kept secret. They hide it because it reminds them of the TRUE PURE REAL point of life....They want us to be just like them, monsters in disgiuse, filthy, do every sin under the sun and call it a "life". I will not fall again into that trap most of us fell into. I have a life. I have Islam.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry Jean, Dad and mostly Gramps, a pious Christian who tried to change my views. Im stepping down from my old way of life AND my old religion. I started this letter as a Christian but I end it as a Muslim.<br>  <br>  " I bear witness that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is the last messenger.<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  Aaron

They were greatly admired but hard to imitate in large numbers.  So a monastic movement began, and lay people had opportunities to live disciplined lives of prayer and self denial without having to be completely self-sufficient or rely completely on alms.  But women as well as men wanted these experiences, so there were monasteries and abbeys for them as well.  Monks and nuns have been a part of church life ever since the middle ages.  There are varying degrees of commitment, however. Some are strictly contemplative and have very little contact outside monastery walls.  Others live in convents and work in the public as teachers, nurses, social workers, etc.<br>  <br>  What's the point of having Saints?<br>  <br>  "Saint" was how members of Christian communities referred to each other in the early days of the Church.  It meant they were "holy", special, separate from ordinary people by virtue of their understanding and living out of the Christian message.  But they were also expecting Jesus to return very soon, and when members were executed by the Romans, their survivors were very concerned that they would miss the Second Coming.  They were assured by Paul and the Apostles that this was not the case and they came to see dead members as members nonetheless.  All Christians, alive or "asleep" were members of the "communion of saints".  Those who continued on could remember the departed, honor their names, pray for them, and ask them for help praying to God, just like any other living saint.  The dead saints were the inspiring heroes of the living saints, having paid the ultimate price for their faith.  But when persecution finally ended, martyrdom became for less common.  People who died believers without being martyrs were just as honorable and effective, so the term "saint" gradually came to be associated only with those who had already died.<br>  <br>  Why are there Alter boys?<br>  <br>  The medieval church had several levels of ordination to the priesthood.  One began as porter (doorkeeper), then progressed to lector (reader), exorcist (able to bless and purify liturgical objects), and acolyte (assistant) before taking on the major orders of sub-deacon, deacon and finally priest,  Then about the 11th Century, church leaders realized that some of the minor orders were not all that difficult, particularly acolyte, and that a boy could be trained to do the tasks easily.  We have had altar servers ever since.  Their task is to assist the priest at mass by holding prayerbooks for him, setting up books, linens and vessels at the altar, and carrying candles and other things.<br>  <br>  Do Catholics believe in having guardian angels?<br>  <br>  Prominent churchmen have proclaimed that there are guardian angels, using Biblical references, but it is not required that one believes in their literal existence.<br>  <br>  Why do Catholics have mass?<br>  <br>  The Catholic Mass grew out of two liturgical practices, the Jewish Sabbath synagogue service and the Sunday Christian agape ("love meal") modeled on the "Last Supper" Passover meal.  When Christians were thrown out of the synagogues, they decided to incorporate scripture reading and study into their Sunday liturgies.  Since then some of the elements have become formally ritualized, but the basic structure of the Mass dates back to those days in the First Century.<br>  <br>  Let's say you aren't a Catholic, could you visit Vatican City?<br>  <br>  Of course.  You can even get a short audience with the pope if you are patient or know the right people.  All sorts of people tour the Sistine Chapel, the Lateran Basilica and St. Peters Square.  It's very small for a country, so it doesn't have a lot of amenities to offer but there are some shops for travelers.  The Vatican has extensive diplomatic facilities, administrative offices, a newspaper and a radio station.  Such of these as can be are available to tourism.<br>  <br>  Now I have a question.  If I answer and I am not iamacatholic2, will you ignore my answer?  Remember, imacatholic2 is neither a theologian nor a spokesperson for the Church.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	First of all, your questions are not offensive. You are asking truthfully to understand these things and we do not take offense to people who wish to know, only those who demand an answer for a misconception and do not listen to the truth. <br>  <br>  Also, Donna: imacatholic2 has been around, she answered a question last week and usually comes on a few times a week when she has the time. <br>  <br>  Skepsis: Though you are correct that imacatholic2 is not a trained theologian, neither are you and neither are you Catholic or Protestant according to your profile. <br>  <br>  Now, onto the questions:<br>  <br>  <<Why does the Catholic church have Nuns?>><br>  <br>  The same reason we have monks. Nuns are women who wish to dedicate their lives to Jesus Christ and give up marriage for the glory of the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19:11-12) <br>  <br>  Nuns live celibate lives and they're, along with monks, are a large part of the Church that constantly prays. Many of these nuns live in convents where they pray throughout the day, contemplating the Passion of Jesus Christ along with the glorious mysteries of his birth and ressurrection. <br>  <br>  The nuns also are responsible for most of the soup kitchens, the orphanages, the AID clinics in Africa, caring for the poor and more. They are a big help in the Church helping people throughout the world and caring for God's children. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11164a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11164a.h...</a> <br>  <br>  <<What's the point of having Saints?>><br>  <br>  The point? I don’t know what exactly you mean by that…we didn’t create Saints for a reason. We have Saints because they are people who have passed on before us that we *know* are in Heaven. There are many Saints that are unknown because we don’t have proof that they are in Heaven and the Catholic Church doesn’t canonize a person lightly.<br>  <br>  To canonize means to publically declare that a person is now in Heaven. There are quite a few steps that must be taken before this can happen and you can look into it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.cscsisters.org/spirituality/canonization.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cscsisters.org/spirituality/c...</a> <br>  <br>  I guess if you want a point, the “point” of Saints is to glorify God. These are people who know are in Heaven and are before God night and day, praying to Him. We ask them to pray for us and to help us in our daily lives because they have been perfected in the Blood of Christ and now share eternity with Him. Each Catholic person (And Lutherans too I believe) has a Patron Saint. This is someone the Catholic feel a connection to, be it they just like the Saint; they share their birthday with the Saint or something deeper. Sometimes, the Saint can choose the person as well as is the case with my mother and St. Rita.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Why are there Alter boys?>><br>  <br>  Altar boys assist the priest during Mass. Originally, Altar boys were seminarians, meaning they were men studying to become priests. These men used to assist during the Latin Mass more than they do today, but they are still important to the Mass. They usually carry the crucifix into and out of Mass, they get the prayer book for the priest, the water and washing basin and towel for the priest during the consecration and they also help clean up after the Eucharist is distributed. They are a large help for the priest, but the priest doesn’t need to have altar servers to perform Mass.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Do Catholics believe in having guardian angels?>><br>  <br>  Yes, we do believe in Guardian Angels and we do believe that each person has one.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Why do Catholics have mass?>><br>  <br>  Mass is sort of like Protestant services in the idea that it is used to worship God. The difference is that the Catholic Mass has a much deeper meaning than just a gathering of believers for fellowship.  The Mass is a celebration for the Eucharist, the pinnacle of why we even go to Mass. We do go to be with others who believe as we do and to strengthen our beliefs, but it is through the Eucharist that we find fellowship with Jesus Christ and the entire reason we go. I can be standing with thousands of people or it can be just me and the priest, either way, I am there to receive the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  The Eucharist is the Body & Blood, Soul & Divinity of Jesus Christ. Catholics know and believe that the bread and wine are truly turned into Body & Blood and we treat the Eucharist with extreme care and reverence. The entire reason for Mass is to receive the Eucharist, there is no greater way to worship God than to receive Him in the Eucharist. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carr.org/~meripper/faith/massexpl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carr.org/~meripper/faith/mass...</a><br>  <br>  This is a very good explanation:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stagnescathedral.org/Parish/mass/mass.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stagnescathedral.org/Parish/m...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  <<Let's say you aren't a Catholic, could you visit Vatican City?>><br>  <br>  Of course!

They have decided not to marry and have children so they are more free to do this.<br>  <br>  Saints are Christians from the past who have led exemplary lives and are now an inspiration to us to lead a good Christian life.<br>  <br>  Altar boys are helpers during the Mass.  They assist the priest by handing him things and take care of the candles.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that God sends angels to help us.<br>  <br>  The Mass is a service centered around the Eucharist -- the sacrament of Communion. There are other things like prayers, a sermon, music, etc., but the Eucharist is the center.<br>  <br>  Anyone can visit Vatican City and go in any part that is open to the public.  There are no special places reserved for Catholics and closed to others.  You just can't go in people's private offices or living quarters without permission.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Nuns are women who chose to give up their personal life for a life of prayer, possibly poverty, charity and teaching the faith. The Catholic Church has nuns because it is a great vocation for women who want to dedicate their lives to Christ in service of His Church.<br>  <br>  Saints are people who lived their lives in the friendship of Christ. All Christians living and dead if in the friendship of Christ are saints, we especially acknowledge those who have gone before us who have already received their heavenly crown and look to them for help and guidance. They are already with Christ so they can help us to recommend ourselves to Him our Lord and Savior.<br>  <br>  Altar boys assist priests during the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.<br>  <br>  Yes Catholics believe we all have a Guardian Angel. My Angel I named Bernadette Marie.<br>  <br>  Mass is the re-enactment of the Last Supper, we prepare for the celebration of the Eucharist by reading both the Old and New Testaments and a Gospel reading.<br>  <br>  The Vatican is rich not only in Catholic History but in beautiful art.

The practices of Catholicism can seem bewildering to those looking in from the outside.  <br>  <br>  The best thing I could suggest for you is to sit in on an RCIA class.  It stands for Roman Catholic Initiation for Adults, and is a class for those who either want to convert, or want to understand more about Catholicism, like you.  There is NO pressure to convert in these classes.  It is entirely up to you whether you simply want to sit in for information or not.<br>  <br>  The reason I don't simply answer your question is because there just aren't simple answers.  You would have to have a fundamental understanding first, and then build upon that to address your questions.  The topic of nuns alone and the fact that they are considered Brides of Christ.... many, many books have been written about this subject.  And Mass, where to begin?  I could tell you that essentially it is a re-enactment of Christ's Last Supper, but that would be just scratching the surface.... volumes and volumes of many books have been written about the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  But don't let the complexity daunt you.  Find a Catholic friend and ask about RCIA.  That way, you can not only get your questions answered, but you might even begin a lifelong process of learning about the Faith.  I hope you do.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|GAel6aReaa	I think saints help extend the Vatican's reach. also allowing individual cultures to be able to offer something to the table. you know, like a local representative from say, munich germany. who does all kinds of good stuff as a priest or servant of god and when they die, they go to heaven and become noted by god for their good deeds. <br>  <br>  so now germany is important to the catholic church and germany feels accepted and warm and fuzzy because one of theirs got chosen. now alot of germans will feel more "comfortable" praying to their own. (not saying germans are racists or anything..... any more)<br>  <br>  anyhow saints, allow you to contact god through them about certain issues. or they will watch over you like angels in certain aspects if you ask. I think they can be selected "guardian angels" by you.<br>  <br>  god sends his own to you when he sees fit.<br>  <br>  <br>  all people need to live their lives according to the catholics.<br>  so,  what better place to start with than the young and alter boys. its considered and honor and I believe their first steps to obtaining their own status as a priest.<br>  <br>  same concept as the cub scouts. originally a military spin off, to train the young kids to become successful soldiers by teaching them survival basics. <br>  <br>  nuns.... women should have the opportunity to serve god as well. they are supposed to be just as strict on their personal lives and their work for god as monks and priests. <br>  <br>  mass? all churches gather to become the force they are. Worshiping god alone at home doesn't give one good direction on how to act as a member of the catholic culture.<br>  Plus its a place to dedicate your time to god and all those that serve him, and a nice place for the church to collect money.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but again.... I'm not catholic, nor have I ever been to more than 1 catholic mass.<br>  I am actually atheist.<br>  <br>  <br>  VatiCAN<br>  VatiCAN'T<br>  yes. as a non catholic you CAN go to the Vatican
MsA2pOpIaa	Yeah, its a combination of looks and personality|`|50vkMfPsaa	i really do agree. people tend to find other people in the same emotional state as themselves.|`|HKtxjWV1aa	So if I feel really attractive, I'll attract attractive people?|`|M4GYj9UIaa	looks, personality and confidence those are what people look for and that is what they are attracted too :)
50c1d92064fa2b7852c7d54f841b22d9aa	It is there. Tons of younger women have entitlement issues, but it is apparent that our own pop culture has only made the problem worse. TV shows, movies, and even commercials present men as somehow less intelligent and less important then their wives.  That really bothers me. Why should men be treated poorly. Feminism started to try and bridge the gap between men and women and make us as equal as possible (not all women can cook just like not all men work on cars everyone has their own strengths) Now we as women are putting men in the position that we were in for generations. Why? our mothers and grandmothers will tell us how hard they fought or how different it was for them and yet we want to put our sons, husbands, and brothers in that same position that we're so desperate to escape.It makes no sense what so ever. The "female supremacists" need to wake up and see what they're doing.|`|I0B7oAfOaa	I think they just say things like that to blow off steam. The women I know who talk like that don't mean anything when they put men down, but usually they work the same number of hours as their husbands who come home sit down and wait for dinner. These women do all the cooking, cleaning and taking care of their kids even though before they were married, it was agreed that it wasn't going to be like that. <br>  That said, most women that I know don't talk like that about men, except in the same kind of jokes that the guys say about them. Female supremacy is a joke...especially by anyone who calls herself a feminist. There are all kinds of dumb, slobbering horny idiots out there...including myself at times...It has nothing to do with gender, but  a lot to do genetics!|`|HKtxjWV1aa	You're damn right, particularly girls in the West.

It seems we cannot find a happy medium.|`|5MaWIUTmaa	Stop whining like a baby and grow a spine.  Here you are complaining over women having a confident, high-esteemed attitude in which they no longer want to be bullied into accepting and buying into the male patriarchy bullshit.  For so long patriarchalism has led to nothing but destruction, terroism and oppression.   Hooray for women.  It's about time.

Half of them then go on to believe that and act accordingly, while the other half lash out at anyone who is feminist, insulting us and saying that we're all hairy, man-hating lesbians (and crazy henpecked men, also, lesbianism shouldn't be an insult) when it's really not true. Well, some are lesbians but so what? Like it makes any difference.<br>  <br>  You'd be surprised the people that give me funny looks if I say that I'm a feminist. I believe in equal rights- including more paternity leave for men- but I still consider myself feminist because that's what it was originally about, and because I think a woman should have total control over her own body.<br>  <br>  I have no respect for women who insist that dressing like a slapper all the time makes them feminist, or those who refuse to wear makeup and that makes them feminist. I feel feminism is about choice, choosing what to wear and who to date rather than being told or feeling you have to be one extreme or the other. It should be about having enough self-respect to ask for what you want, not having an attitude problem which causes you to demand more than your fair share.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Well, I've never thought true religion to be a sham, but I do know there is such a thing as false religion. I've experienced both. When I was involved with the false type I didn't get emotional feelings, nor any beautiful experiences. I did feel great confidence and confirmation in the camaraderie of friends. Then I stumbled across something beautiful one winter night when I joined a small group of Christians in a rather bleak little room. They had gathered for a prayer meeting - something I had never attended in my life, for all my religiosity. Well, after a consideration of a Bible passage, prayer began and I felt as if I was suddenly in amongst those people mentioned in Revelation chapter 7 - those standing before God worshipping him. Many prayers were purely of thanksgiving and praise. God wasn't being asked for anything. Some spoke eloquently, others hesitantly. There were spontaneous pauses between prayers. Everyone was free to pray if they wanted to. Many prayed silently. That was my beautiful happening - being awoken to the loveliness of simple prayer.<br>  <br>  Music also affects me, but privately. When I'm at home, on my own, and my heart moves me to sit and play piano and sing God's praises, I feel a real sense of heart. Things that get in the way of pure worship (for me) are irritation at others, pride in something I've done, and being depressed. That all makes preparation for worship very necessary - getting rid of those negatives and seeking forgiveness. I don't take the time I ought to do that. Whoever Irene Stevenson is, she sounds as if she's really got soul! She really knows the importance of concentrating wholly on the beauty of the Lord!|`|wSYYfBK4aa	Yes, and that's exactly why I think religion is a sham.<br>  Religion takes the beauty of spirituality, commoditizes it, packages it and sells it to the desperate and gullible masses, then perverts it for material and political gain.|`|0lACfoXSaa	For those of you who feel drugs are bad have you ever participated in a night when something beautiful has happened?<br>  <br>  Clearly not. But many millions have. Doesnt make it good or bad.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I have experienced that sort of thing on my own, without others around. You cannot hear god speaking when a thousand voices drown him out:)|`|jWTZfP4naa	usually it's church that gets between people and worship, isn't it?|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Music can be a beautiful thing, regardless of the spiritual or non-spiritual origin. Each and every religion claims to have the "one true god" and I have seen nothing to convince me that this is a true statement. If one really DOES, then what about the claims of the rest? Aren't they then just as doomed to eternal torment just as I, a non-believer, are supposed to be? Isn't a belief in the wrong god just as bad as no god at all? If god is so all-knowing, so all-powerful, so-omnipotent, then WHY does god use a middleman in the form of a pope or priest to spread the word of god? Why not just speak for himself? It would be SO easy if god is all religion SAYS god is. Yet, god chooses to be obscure, show NO proof which he could easily DO, and use a middleman to try and convince ME that there IS a god. Sorry, until you can show some form of proof, I choose to use my days for private use which does NOT involve worship of an invisible friend who no one can see, hear or touch. And then you believers go on and on about the miracles and that prayers are answered if you believe enough. Bull. Whose prayers were answered by the Tsunami in Indonesia that killed 300,000 people? The hurricane Latrina which devastated portions of the Gulf Coast? If you thank god for that string of green lights you hit at the top of rush hour, then you have to place the blame for the casualties as well. I fail to see what part of god's plan, in god''s infinite wisdom, was the killing of all plants and animals NOT with Noah on the Ark. Pretty selfish and self-centere  d, wasn't it? To save so FEW and kill SO MANY? To use a metaphor, wouldn't that  make god a hypocrite in a sense? That god IS capable of making a mistake? That god is fallible and MADE A MISTAKE? Isn't Noah and the Ark really a form of a DO-OVER? I have failed to understand what you mean with the phrase "real religion" which is as opposed to what, a FAKE religion? So WHICH are the fakes and which is the ONE TRUE religion? Of course, if I am wrong about this all, and one day find myself experiencing a personal judgment day, I will be the first to recant and admit my error and beg forgiveness, which according to YOU believers out there, god HAS TO DO, forgive me that is, and that means NO HELL FOR ME!|`|wwdllMzYaa	not as of late no<br>   maybe, when i was 6 or soemthing, but, its not like i had much say over that<br>  <br>  i have always avoidedit since i became more able to think for myself<br>  <br>  religionproves religion is a sham<br>  nothing else, it does it fine on is own<br>  <br>  genuine religion?<br>  its the same as waht you beleive is ungenuine religion<br>  but,presumably, you belive different<br>  so its unlikely we are going to find any agreement on that<br>  <br>  what other people say, affects what other people say<br>  thats soceity for you<br>  its not evidence of anything, except that psychology and sociology are evident and affect us all|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	Most people who are anti religion used to belong to one.<br>  <br>  What you describe above is hysteria.<br>  <br>  Thousands (maybe more) people claim Manchester united is the best ever football team does that prove that they are?|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	One of the most beautiful spiritual experiences I ever had was in the Idaho wilderness with some members of the Nez Perce tribe who allowed us to participate in one of their pipe ceremonies.

When I was Catholic and attending Catholic school, I was in church on a Friday morning (we were required to go to mass before school once a week), and it suddenly occurred to me how silly all of it was. I looked around at the other kids, and at the nuns and asked myself "What am I doing here?" I had always had doubts, but it was as though a sudden light filled my head, and I felt a weight lift off me. <br>  <br>  It was the beginning of a journey. After several more years of study  into all religions (including reading both the Catholic and Protestant bibles), reflection and self examination, I came to the conclusion there were no gods, and religion was an invention so men could control other men, and explain what they didn't understand. The intellectual bankruptcy of "God did it" no longer made any sense. I've been a confirmed atheist, humanist, and fan of the scientific method ever since. It was, as you say, a beautiful thing.

So they dripped her in as far as she would go and began to splash water for "complete submersion".  When she couldn't hold her breath any longer, the woman jumped up and started shouting, singing and dancing like in the movies.  <br>  <br>  My grandmother comes from a rural town and thought it was the "most bizarre and blessed thing I've ever seen".<br>  <br>  :)  It was actually quite humorous and touching the way my grandmother was re-enacting it for me.<br>  <br>  <br>  But back to subject... once people start living direly, they tend to turn towards religion.

Not even an eighth of the inmates show up to the church services on Sundays. Only a hand full show up to other functions like Bible study. Those that do show up on Sundays do it because they feel that is what a Christian does to go to heaven.

Science has nothing to do with it.  <br>  <br>  Science cannot hypothesize nor theorize about that which is supernatural and higher and greater than nature; and they cannot study the One who is not limited to the natural laws of the universe which science studies.  <br>  <br>  God is a Supernatural, Spiritual, Eternal, Holy Being. He can't be studied, accepted, or denied by science, as science can only study that which is natural, material, temporal and observable.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, science and its "discoveries" have no effect whatsoever on my faith and trust in Christ - no matter how many Marvin the Martins from the Bugs Bunny cartoons NASA ever finds floating out in outer space.  It is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  It is the agenda of atheistic, evolutionary, big-banger scientists that try to disprove the Bible and who reject the notion of God that is the issue; not the lie that Christians are opposed to science - that is the real issue you should consider.|`|6YiYlpgEaa	The bible is wee scraps of paper glued to a pathetic hard cover.

But it really says "fear", and it's manipulative humans, not God, who command fear.|`|r8rykCkGaa	It just means the opposite of ignoring God.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	God is omnipotent.<br>  Some words in The Bible are hard to translate into English.  The word fear in the sense of God-fearing pertains to the appropriate attitude of awe-filled respect we should have for God.   It also reminds us that it makes absolutely no sense to choose to eternally separate ourselves from Him.  <br>  <br>  God is the Creator of all that is.   All goodness is from God.  If you choose to reject Him, you are choosing to reject all goodness.  In eternal terms,  that is called Hell.  People's fear of God should include awesome reverence and respect,  in addition to a frank understanding that we are dependent on God for our very existence.  All people should fear being eternally separated from God,  because to be eternally separated from God would be to experience unimaginably dreadful suffering and torment.   The chief torment of Hell is the eternal total separation from God.  <br>  <br>  Using a simple definition of fear,  human fear related to God should be thought of as a fear of Reality - since most people are not used to engaging and accepting Reality on a daily basis.  We all try to some degree to avoid facing Reality in our lives.   In our hearts,  we usually know this,  but with persistent turning away from Reality,  we can lose our ability to even recognize it.   <br>  <br>  Sins are, in a sense,  an attempt to avoid Reality.   Sins should give rise to a feeling of fear because sins are a way of destroying our contact with Reality.   God is perfectly genuine.  There is no person or thing that is more authentically Real than God.   Sooner or later,  Reality must be faced.   <br>  <br>  Anyone who has been avoiding God has been avoiding Reality.   The more a person does this,  the more difficult it will be to regain contact with The Truth.   If you reject God,  that is genuine cause for a deep feeling of fear.  You might be rejecting Him for Eternity. <br>  <br>  Accept The Truth,  and you will have little or nothing to fear.<br>  True Peace - with no fear,  is to be found by accepting<br>  God The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|yqUgRG2raa	Basically, the Protestant church has a different slant on this. In some religions people bow or even lay on the floor to show devotion. The Protestant church does the opposite, they stand. This is to show respect for it is "awe" not "fear".

But fearing him seems to smack more of the Middle Ages. <br>  . We should not think of it as being the way a child fears a brutal father or a population is terrorized by an oppressive ruler. <br>  Fear of God is a natural feeling that gives us the same kind of security that a father who inspires deep respect gives to his children.<br>  <br>  It is entirely appropriate for the angel to urge all mankind today to fear God. Without proper godly fear, we will likely give in to wrong impulses or succumb to fear of man. If we cultivate the proper form of fear, we will be helped to act wisely. “The fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9:10; Psalm 111:10) True, we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

According to the Bible, God is the all-powerful creator of the universe and the term 'fear' is implying that you must respect Him. It's implying that He is the most powerful and no other power surpasses His.|`|KJZol6Gpaa	It is a language translation problem that is tripping you up.  Remember that the Bible wasn't written in English. <br>  <br>  The word "fear" might better be translated as "reverent awe and fear and worshipful wonder," but that is awfully long and cumbersome.<br>  <br>  To understand what scriptures mean by "fearing God," consider this.  God created everything, the whole universe, from the distant galaxies, to the tiniest gems, to the laws of nature and mathematics, to the most beautiful sunsets and the songs of the Mockingbird.  He is the Great Artist of the universe, but He created you -- yes YOU! -- as his own self-portrait!  He sculpted YOU in His own image!!  And He LOVES you!!!  And He wants a relationship with YOU!!!!<br>  <br>  If that doesn't make you weak in the knees, you haven't thought about it hard enough.<br>  <br>  And when you have thought about it hard enough, you will understand why it is difficult to translate that concept into English, and how the word "fear," though inadaquate, is, perhaps, the most reasonable choice of words.<br>  <br>  I've heard it said that Faith and humility are like two sides of the same coin.  Faith is knowing who God is, and how He relates to you.  Humility is knowing who you are, and how you relate to Him.<br>  <br>  For better understanding of these translation issues, you might like to compare the version of scripture that you are used to with the Amplified Bible.  The Amplified Bible tries to sacrifice brevity for completeness, when translating hard-to-translate words and phrases.  It is often a real help when trying to figure out the "huh??" sections of scripture.  Happily, the Amplified Bible is one of many English translations that are available online.<br>  <br>  For samples of how the Amplified Bible translates a couple of well-known "fear the Lord" passages, compared with a couple of other popular English translations, see the links:|`|EAix5Av9aa	We fear Him as pride can easily beset us if we challenge, cause doubt or allow the enemy to deceive us.<br>   "The fear of God is the beginning of all understanding"  Provberbs<br>    We enter with praise and thanks and rejoicing as we then have communal with God.through Jesus Christ.|`|0YQRbq9faa	"Fear" in the Bible in the context of your question means to revere, to respect, to hold in highest priority in ones thoughts and life, and to give weight to the words of other.<br>  <br>  It is not fear like a phobia or being afraid silly.|`|O8T5pIZsaa	"Fear of god" comes from the days when there weren't any policing; it was a perfect way for the church to keep people in line, and it still works today to some extent.|`|6sfHWQdKaa	Exactly.

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.   For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.   For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

But there's a part of us that doesn't even go to sleep, in fact it never stops functioning, even when our bodies are at rest or even unconscious.  Our "superior conscious energy" remains aware no matter whether we're asleep, in a trance, hypnotized, in a coma or whatever.  Brainwaves are still working in there.<br>  <br>  This is the part I believe survives when we die.  I think our conscious energy remains behind when our physical forms expire.  Our "vessels" are buried or cremated and we, as pure thought energy, go on our way.<br>  <br>  There is no heaven or hell.  We find we are still "alive" as pure conscious thought energy and we can join the mass Universal Consciousness of beings who are already there. This is where we possibly meet loved ones who have passed away before us.<br>  <br>  The Universal Consciousness helps us review our life, see what we've learned while we were alive. Nothing is wrong or sinful; it's just learning. There is no punishment, no judgment, no "cloud father" who looks like Gandalf and talks like James Earl Jones on loudspeaker. Nobody holds you accountable for any wrong you may have done. There is only joining and love and contentment.<br>  <br>  Then, if we choose, we may reincarnate, come back and try something new. When we do, we return into a living newborn as it takes its first breath of life. We don't waste nine months of boredom inside a blastocyst, growing limbs and genitals and listening to our parents play music into our amniotic fluid.  <br>  <br>  It's nice after death; an adventure.  Google Universal Consciousness or Higher Self for more information.<br>  Blessings|`|Nfb0Biaraa	I like to think there is an afterlife, but I don't really have any idea what it'll be like. But it really comes down to whether you believe that people have a soul or not, because if there is such a thing, then it should endure forever, right? It's something that will bug you forever. Personally, I think that death will release your soul (or whatever) from the restrictions of the 3rd dimension, and leave your soul to be sucked past the 4th dimension (which is time) into a completely separate one. So I guess I kind of believe in an eternal heaven. My advice to you is to come up with your own theories on death. Who knows? They might actually coincide with many others'.|`|77347b9dea982aa5d7b319539efdc5caaa	There is no reason to believe that after you die, you suddenly gain new experiences.<br>  <br>  If you lose your eyes, you lose your sight.<br>  If you damage your ears, you lose your hearing.<br>  If you damage your nerves, you feel nothing.<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  If you lose all the function in your brain, you cease to experience anything. This is the obvious conclusion. If you want to know what it is like to be dead, then think back 100 years. What was it like then? You didn't have a body or a mind then.

Most of the "evidence" put forth usually ends up to have a real-world explanation, debunked by science. <br>  <br>  Aliens have nothing to do with the supernatural. Given the number of galaxies in the universe, and the numbers of stars resembling our sun withing those galaxies, the possibility of life existing elsewhere is much more likely than the existence of gods. <br>  <br>  Psychics are really good guessers, and/or very good at reading other people.

Too many people state that they have seen ghosts, even if most of them are mistaken then that leaves some who must be telling the truth. I do think a small amount of mind reading goes on.

EBGdlo35aa	Well,  I suspect that what you meant - and what most of these overlooked - is the legend that Shakespeare was involved in translating or editing the King James Version.<br>  <br>  The legend is as follows<br>  <a href="http://members.cox.net/davidrytell/Shake.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.cox.net/davidrytell/Shake...</a><br>  <br>  However, this is easily disproved by looking at Psalm 46 of the Bishops' Bible, which was the primary reference bible for the King James Version translators.<br>  <a href="http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=ps+46&t=bis&st=1&new=1&l=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=ps...</a><br>  <br>  As you see, this bible - published in 1568 - shows an identical Psalm 46.  Clearly, Shakespeare did *not* have a hand in altering this particular Psalm, and there is no reason to otherwise conclude that he was involved in the translation or editing of the King James Version.<br>  <br>  In other words:  it is a legend based upon a coincidence that someone happened to notice.  It is very common for humans to make cause/effect connections that do not actually have any such relationship.  For example:  you put on an unwashed pair of socks before a baseball game and you perform really well.  Obviously, not washing your socks makes you a better player, right?  Thus, the lucky pair of socks that you don't wash and that you wear every game.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|bgA9wLD0aa	all you have to do is read the bible to know it isn't shakespeare.<br>  <br>  the plot is horrendous, the prose is dry, and the characterization is shallow.  this is not the work of shakespeare.|`|AA12346187	I have  never heard that suggestion and of course  there is no  truth in it.  the bible  was  written long before shakespeare was born.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Never heard of that.|`|0YQRbq9faa	The bulk of the King James Bible's translation came from the translation work of John Wycliffe who was unjustly burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic church for putting the Bible into English.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	No but I think he restated some similar concepts . check you time reference . willy lived in a different era long after the bible was originated.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	First I heard of this one<br>  .<br>  Kind of thought that all the books of the today bible were put together<br>  .<br>  From many books that were floating to say around<br>  .|`|JseyoIfLaa	No it was Sir Francis Bacon.

Moses was  married to black (Ethiopian) women. When his siblings talked against Moses for who he had married. The Lord God struck his sister with Leprosy, he healed her after 7 days. <br>  <br>  The bible is not looking at inter-racial marriges like we i.e. Black/white, white/Asian , Asian/Native American etc. Its looking at different tribes/groups so Hebrews/Amorties,  Hebrews/Hivites , Hivites/Canannites would have been considered inter-racial marriage regardless what skin complexion the people were. <br>  <br>  Hebrews weren’t suppose to marry Hittites, Girgashites, Canannites ,Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites and probably some others.  Much of it had to do with the fact that those groups worshiped other gods or and idols it was not based on skin tone. <br>  <br>  <br>  The apostle Paul also encouraged believers to not marry non-believers. So yes there is tabooing of marrying someone of a different faith. <br>  <br>  To be honest the bible rarely mentions anyone’s skin tone.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	Mixed marriages were, and are still, condemned by God. He caused the different races to come into being after He destroyed the Tower of Babel and confused the languages of man.<br>  <br>  We were never meant to come together again, God does not change His mind. We are supposed to marry our own kind only and not go against God's will by diluting the races or by speaking in one language again.<br>  <br>  All the languages of the Earth were separate and distinct until the advent of the computer. The computer is an affront against God's will by allowing all of mankind to disobey God and speak in one language again. The binary code, the computer language, is a mathematical language accessed by every country and is under a curse by God, just as intermarrying between races is cursed.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	It was forbidden to the Chosen people (Hebrews) in the old testament, But there where certain exceptions, something about  after the fourth generation you can let a person with some Egyptian blood back in the congregation .

It seems though that in the new testament, James 2:1-10, such discrimination was rescinded. <br>  You know, it's hard to tell anything in the Bible.

At least there are actually elephants.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello Passion,<br>  <br>  The issue had nothing to do with race but different religions and I assume you mean religion. Mixing was discouraged and the Prophets ragged on the Jewish Kings about it. Unfortunately some of Solomon's many wives were pagans and this really irked the religious authorities; especially when he pissed God off by letting them have their little pagan shrines and ceremonies. One of his heirs who married the pagan, Jezebel was a catalyst who helped facilitate eventual civil war and the split up of the Jews into Israel and Judea, two weaker states ripe for the plucking by other conquerors shortly down the road.<br>  Thus was the fate of such collaboration as prophesied by the prophets.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|zQyslfHKaa	Not in the bible, but bible followers used it to claim exactly that.

There was a point in the old testament where a man could have a couple of wives if he wanted.  I'm not sure if that worked out the same for the women having multiple husbands...  I don't remember any women having such.  I think the bible says that King Solomon had 4000 concubines (wives) or something like that...  Abram (Abraham) had a few too, I think.<br>  <br>  Same sex marriages have ALWAYS been unacceptable in the Bible, old and new testament.  You can read about Sodom and Gommorah in the Old testament...  you can read about the church's opinion of same sex relationships period very plainly in Romans 1.|`|4vOKQ0YKaa	do u mean gay marriage no, the bible says that marriage is between a man and woman. nothing else. <br>  <br>  if your talking about marriage between black and white, then no god doesn't care what race you marry just as long as they believe in god|`|rU6nh42Eaa	Interracial marriages were not.

The difference is 5.8 points according to findings in developmental psychology!!!    <br>  <br>  More members of the "intellectual elite" considered themselves atheists than the national average.<br>  <br>  Only 7 percent of members of the American National Academy of Sciences believed in God. Whilst only 3.3 percent believed in God in the UK’s Royal Society. <br>  <br>  Several Gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher IQ’s tend not to believe in God." <br>  <br>  Evolution in action with Christians getting left behind like the monkeys and apes before them!!!|`|tGkFPA82aa	Homo sapien sapien tends to have a larger brain pan, longer gestation, and longer rearing period then other members of the Homo genus.<br>  <br>  It's likely our evolution will continue down mental capacity, and mechanical comprehension. <br>  <br>  But I'm not all that psychic. The future is surprising at times.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	It's tough to say.  I believe humans are not evolving anymore.  We've removed ourselves from nature, so natural selection no longer applies to humans in terms of motivating evolutionary change.|`|7cBOKehWaa	Who knows? We can't predict evolution.<br>  <br>  Although I remember reading a study online that claims we're slowly losing our little fingers, whether there's any truth to that, I do not know.|`|sVrkjixAaa	Are there any problems in our DNA that are hindering our ability to survive? Without one, there is no need to evolve.|`|JseyoIfLaa	Transhuman, as in enhanced humans.We are already in the process of evolving into the next stage of human. Every time you hear about medical science coming up with treatments that are about genetic manipulation or nano-technology,  those are  some of the stages that will eventually lead to the new humans. Humans interfacing with machines as in thought manipulated machinery or having the ability to download to directly to your mind from a computer are the next stages of human evolution. We are entering a time when we can control our own evolution. we won't have to wait millions of years but only about 30-40 years.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	When will you people understand that atheism is not synonymous with belief in evolution?<br>  <br>  <br>  You must also gain a knowledge of evolution if you really want to ask a serious question. Humans did NOT evolve from any currently living primate. Rather we humans and all other primates have a common ancestor from which we deviated.<br>  <br>  I think that it is possible that with the knowledge that we are gaining in Biology we will actually be able to control our species' evolution somewhat.<br>  <br>  That being said, no I do not think that whatever form Humanity takes in the future will co-exist with current humans.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	Firstly, evolution is "true", or more correctly, evolution theory is more or less right on the money and evolution does happen regardless of your opinion of the theory's validity.<br>  <br>  What we'll evolve into is an interesting subject though.  While we are subject to evolution, we are outside of the jurisdiction of natural selection because we support ourselves with medical care and use tools to further our ability without need for suitable appendages.  There is no real pressure to evolve to suit an environment so we will probably not evolve in that way.<br>  <br>  What I do expect to happen eventually is the majority of our species to homogenise - all 'races' have access to each other and there is no boundary to keep traights seperate.  It's likely that over the next thousand years, man will become one single 'race'.  Of course this is dependant on the erradication of poverty in the world.  And of course I don't mean this in a "all races will become white" racist sort of way because it's likely that a medium amount of skin pigment will be the right amount, white skin being useless in preventing UV damage in hotter climates.<br>  <br>  There is, of course, the prospect of self-modification on the board.  Gene therapy, once refined, will be able to repair, replace or add genes to our entire body's genome, even, I might wager, our germ cells, giving rise to the hereditary gene therapy.  Using this method, it's possible that man will eventually be able to remove detrimental traights such as short/long sightedness, and be able to create better genome protection systems to help in preventing cancer, maybe even 'curing' the aging process.  Of course this is outside the spec' of evolution but it's still an interesting prospect. <br>  <br>  I do hope, now that I've taken the time to answer this, that you'll actually choose a 'Best Answer' that actually bothers to answer the question, and not some random response that denies that evolution happens.  Don't be a troll. :)|`|sJegUB11aa	I believe that we'll take control of our evolution.  Computer modeling will allow us to reach our own goals, instead of evolutionarily reacting to our environment.  It's also likely that there will be many kinds of beings descended from humans, allowing human life to exist on other planets around other stars without having to terraform them and ruin their natural ecologies.|`|bF7yUXy5aa	There are a bunch of hypothesis'. My favorite is that we were evolve into a kind of caste system of ugly, troll-like people and tall, freaky looking rich people.<br>  <br>  What is, in my opinion, the best hypothesis is that evolution kind of ends with us. We're too spread out and too capable of conquering our environment that there will be no pressure for us to evolve too much physically. This extends further by saying that we will begin to blend with our technology.<br>  <br>  In the end, nobody knows. Fun to think about though.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	We'll find out in a few million years, It's so exciting, I can't wait!<br>  <br>  OH, I think I just felt a cell mutate, OMG, OMG....|`|3RYqo9dJaa	o.O Do you think we're psychic?<br>  <br>  <----Theistic "evolutionist"|`|mr8isJoZaa	I was going to answer until I saw Mistiza's answer, the best one I've seen in a long time.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	It seems like it is obvious <br>  Gays are a process of evolution. For the most part they have higher IQs and are more talented. Their brain much like a woman's is more complex than their hedro male counterparts. This process of evolution is the earth saying enough with all the breeding already. <br>  <br>  Speculating; humanity in the near future will take giant leaps due to cloning and human intervention in the process. I predict in the future we will have the ability to live and breath under water, which covers 2/3rds of the planet. Think about it we breath liquid when we are in the womb and deep sea divers fill their lungs with liquids to stay under longer. Yes we have the possibility to go back to the sea not as one-celled animals nor as humans as we know them,  but as complex thinking animals designed and engineered by man.|`|AA11187638	No one really knows, but it is possible, through artificial selection, that we may "design" humans to live on other planets and moons. One day, perhaps we will be able to live in a low atmosphere, low gravity environment like Mars, or even harsher environments like the subglacial seas of Europa.<br>  <br>  The next major leap in evolution will depend on the colonisation of space.|`|4VouLn4waa	I highly doubt that this is a school question, but if it is you need to pay more attention in class. Evolution takes thousands of years first of all. And it is a result of natural selection. Currently most human traits are desirable and arent detrimental to our survival. The traits that are detrimental (disease, obesity, psychological disorders, faith in religion, etc.) arent likely to ever go away because of what causes them. But even though you cannot notice a physical change in our evolution, you would be blind not to notice a mental change in our evolution. That is why we are making medicines and inventing technologies that are allowing us to survive longer|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	First of all Evolution has nothing to do with Atheism.<br>  Second, Evolution is scientific fact, you don't 'believe' in it,you either accept it or you don't.<br>  <br>  No one knows how we will evolve in the future, we'll just have to wait and see.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Why do you ask us things like this?

It would also be hard to believe that a man of today could exist in the world 100 years from now.  <br>  <br>  The theory of evolution basically states, adapt or die.  Most people think things stay the same for 100's of years and then something dramatic causes the change.  Well, man was a farmer for hundreds of years and then, within the last 100 years or so, everything changed dramatically.<br>  <br>  By the way, I am a Christian.  I don't believe that man evolved from a monkey but I do believe that man is evolving right now.|`|y1CRemnPaa	We don't know.<br>  <br>  It is actually thought that for a long time Neanderthal man and Cro-Magnon man lived side-by-side, until either they interbred back to one species, Cro-Magnon man killed off Neanderthal, or Neanderthals were ultimately at such a disadvantage to Cro-Magnons that their niche was co-opted and they died off.<br>  <br>  Was that what you meant?|`|b9fa55c39cc9291237dc7e9acd8e7119aa	Although some major forms of natural selection don't really apply to us anymore you still have to take into account mate choice, random events, and genetic drift.

I myself am an atheist and although I wouldn't call myself a true nihilist I certainly don't believe things have any intrinsic meaning or purpose other than the purpose or meaning that I give to it. I can see how the two ideas are related, but obviously are not necessarily linked.|`|Jd5rm61Uaa	Ha-ha purely due to complete ignorance of the differences I think|`|5a2969878efc1ea28cb5f1d0e5c13b07aa	Just theists.|`|B7pxO9dDaa	I have not come across many people who get these two mixed up but if you are trying to understand the reason why they are put together often let me try to explain why I think that people do it<br>  <br>  As far as I understand Atheists do not beleive in any kind of god in any form.  Most beleive in evolution and the big bang theory and put their trust in scientific explanations to explain the world.  As far as science can tell Death is the end of life.  Nobody has come back from the dead and everyone that has ever lived has died as far as we can tell.  Some atheists may beleive in reincarnation or some other form of afterlife depending on the person,  but as for those that do not birth is the beginning and death is the end.<br>  <br>  I think that's right so far.<br>  <br>  If our lives span only 80 years give or take then how can our existence have meaning or purpose.  Now speaking as though we were dead.  In 1,000,000 years from now or even just 200 we will be forgotten and anything that we did on earth will also be forgotten.  Our children may live on and some of our inventions might as well but that hardly matters to us because we're dead.  We can't think or feel, we no longer exist.  Nothing matters when you don't exist because you can't care about anything because you are nothing.  Therefore everything that mattered to us in our life will cease to matter.  Any meaning or purpose we had will also cease.  Our children and there children would continue to live because of what we had done but when they died it would no longer matter again just as it did with us.  This would happen again and again in an endless cycle.  As far as I can tell life would be pointless, purposeless, and meaningless if Death is the end of life<br>  <br>  As for those who are atheists and do beleive in some form of life before birth or life after death depending on what it is, it may or may not let our lives continue to have a purpose and I don't want to talk about each one I can think of individually.  So I hope this helps you understand a little bit better.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	I don't like the common definition on here of atheism as "not believing in God" as this implies that atheists are mistaken.

N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Yes, it was over the supremacy of the King or supremacy of Parliament. After 3 short wars, parliament forces under Oliver Cromwell won and King Charles the Ist was beheaded for treason. Cromwell ruled for a time as Lord Protector, England a republic but after Cromwell died the people brought back the monarchy but with limited power and no more divine right rule.<br>  <br>  Here is the history in a nutshell:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/civil_war_england.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/civ...</a><br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly<br>  <br>  Edit - Jane S - unfortunately there is a lot of cross threading among the different categories and subjects.

Instead of 'civil war' research the Parliament of England. War movies will not help as the so called 'civil war' - war by its very nature is not civil except when portrayed by Hollywood - in England was not just one incident. You are correct in that it was usually between the King or Queen at the time and the Parliament. Who won you ask, well the Parliament was successful in curbing many of the Royals excesses, although I doubt if the people of the less privileged classes thought much of this. The Magna Cater you could say was the start of freedom for the people if you were a romantic and believed the privileged at the time. I will problem be seen as drawing a long bow here; however I actually class the American war of independence as a continuation of the struggle.<br>  <br>  If, as the romantics claim, these wars were for the people in England and their freedoms why did it take so long for them to stop sending convicts around the world for crimes like a starving man stealing food by hunting in a Royal reserve etc? It is indeed a pity you appear to find this topic irksome as there are many little tit bits of interest to spice up your research. Look no further than the current ceremonies for opening Parliament in England and countries that have there Parliament origins direct from the Westminster system.  Would your forefathers have rebelled if they hadn’t come from this tradition of the wars in England? When I was at school they referred to these wars as the parliamentary wars.|`|mE4Fs4AIaa	i guess king even though i dont know what it is, u like war huh, i think u like war movie, i dont think so|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I'm going out on a limb here in guessing that you don't understand the assignment because you don't do your own work.<br>  <br>  How far off am I?<br>  <br>  I think, if it is YOUR assignment, then YOU need to do the research and work, and then you WILL understand it.<br>  <br>  And, you also might come to figure out how to post things in appropriate categories...this has nothing to do with languages.

If Megan just would have went up and said pretty much said I like you lets go out, that would have most likely worked better then the whole stalking thing.

No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."|`|2MfMyh4Maa	No.  That would be manipulating God, trying to trick Him into giving us something we want.<br>  <br>  Pascal's wager, I think, was not intended to get people to believe.  It was intended to sweep away the irrelevant issue of evidence.  <br>  <br>  God asks us merely to honestly seek Him, "seek and ye shall find".  If God is of worth, surely we would at least seek Him.  Proof of His existence is not necessary for us to seek Him; we seek lots of things that we have no proof that we will find.  We seek what we hope to find and if there is evidence, then hope can lead to a rational belief.<br>  <br>  The fact that the universe had a creation moment is evidence (but not proof) of a Creator.  <br>  <br>  So why don't God-rejectors seek their Creator?  It must be because they don't think Him worthy to seek.  They have "better" things to do with their time.  The bottom line is that evidence is not the reason why God-rejectors choose not to believe.  It is that they don't want God in their lives.|`|l2BjWA5Baa	Romans 10:9 - "If you confess with your mouth 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."<br>  <br>  Clearly it depends on what you mean by "believe;" most secular historians believe that a person named Jesus existed and even demons believe that he is God! It's about a clear belief that what the Bible says about Jesus is true - that he really died and was raised to life again - and a profession of faith in him that will get you to heaven. <br>  <br>  I imagine that to some extent all believers have somewhat tainted motives - if you choose not to believe until you can completely understand and know God, then you never get there at all, do you?  I encourage you to look into it further (try reading the gospel of John; you can find it on the internet) and see how compelling examining Jesus Christ as a person can be.|`|AA11521494	They keep going on about Pascal's Wager because it seems like a good argument for them, not realising that it doesn't work.

Christians have the promise of God that to be absent from the body (i.e. death) is to be present with the Lord (i.e. live in Heaven after you die).<br>  <br>  To believe that Jesus was some great teacher or historical figure or to know about Him or even acknowledge Him is not what gets you into Heaven.<br>  <br>  Realizing you are a sinner that sins and against a pure Holy God is the first step.  Jesus is the Savior of the world who died on the cross to pay for the penalty of your sins, and wants to forgive your sins and give you eternal life and to give you His Holy righteousness when you receive Him by faith into your heart and life - that is what makes you outfitted for heaven - complete, genuine and total trust in Christ as your personal Savior and receiving His perfect, sinless righteousness by faith.  That is what makes you outfitted for Heaven.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  It should a suppose. Fear of the Lord is encouraged and considered to be a wise virtue over the ages.

You have to dedicate your life to the Lord. Most people acheve this via the "sinners prayer" now I have no problem with that but I do know they are not magic words.

I think that's one of the reasons that I'm staring to question my beliefs. Baptists teach you that you can sin as long as you ask for forgiveness. Basically saying that if you're baptized, you're accepted into heaven? I don't quite understand that. I think that if you believe in Jesus in your heart, you're accepted into heaven. Baptists are all over trying to convince people that if they just go get Baptized then they won't go to hell. Therefore, they're telling people to live in the fear of hell. I don't think that's right. Its kind of like "believe what I do, or else you're going to go to hell". I don't know if this helped you in answering your question, but it helped me. Hahaha.|`|y1CRemnPaa	but how will you know whether the catholics or the protestants or the snake handlers or the phelps cult are right?  any one of those probly thinks all the others are going to hell?  and what about islam?  if islam is right and christianity is wrong, then you'd go to a worse hell than the unbeliever!  dont mess around with this stuff.|`|bwigyPMTaa	I'm not a Protestant. I don't believe in Hell. I don't believe that Heaven is where everyone goes after death. My answer though:<br>  <br>  You can't believe anything out of fear. To believe you need to know and understand. That's a requirement. How could you be sure that you're "doing God's will" if that's what you mean by "believe", if you had no idea what he requires? Do you really think that God would hold a gun against your head saying "do you believe?". That's basically what the concept of Hell is doing. Would God need you to give a meaningless "Yes" as answer? Would that be what he wants from you?|`|cKpautWhaa	Sorry but nope. You have to really believe that God loves you and that he died for you. Otherwise, you aren't really committing yourself to him.|`|AA11403192	Jesus says that he has not given you a heart of fear 2 Tim 1:7 so evidently you do not know Him as God but only fear His wrath because you have not repented and you think to take His name in vain He will still forgive you for your great sin and He says that if you don't take the time to know Him and study His face the word of God; He will say depart from me you workers of iniquity you never new me I never new you, and your end will be what you feared most.

When I think of feminist I think of man hating, never happy, wanting more than equal rights women.  I took this course in college that was really fun for the first month (womens literature) and it was going great until we got to a story about rape and then the self described feminists started bad mouthing every male that lives because of this one rapist.  They also bashed us because we were male.  So I dislike feminist because most act like every male is at fault for something that has happened.  I don't dislike females because not all females are feminist.|`|a6742800403eb2364f740b12774b96deaa	Because feminists grafted the ideology of Carl Marx to equal rights for women . Betty Freidan worked 15 years as a proffessional propagandist for Joseph Stalin before writing the Feminine mystique. Stalin starved and Murdered 30 million people.  Most of the core ideologies in American feminism are actualy Marxist in origin. Once you remove the marxism nothing much is happening there. We know that because they failed to get us equal pay for equal work. They failed to get subsidised daycare for the poor paid for by the federal Government. They failed to secure medical care and housing. What they did do was make the US socialy unstable. They made people divided over abortion and homosexuality. For 35 years nothing but those 2 stupid issues. Everything else got ignored.  I think their activities were morally hypocritic . For example all of those feminist majority hags voting to bomb Muslim countries and then acting like Islam was to blame for wall to wall homelessness, hunger ,misery and death. I hate them all with their blazing red lips and shoulder pads . <br>     Oh -let us not forget Phyllis Chessler and her defense of the mass murderer Eileen Wournos. They all stuck up for her. Saying she "took back the night" She killed 5 men!  Tell me -What was that about? A lesbian power fantasy from 1983. <br>  Plenty of women remember what life was like before the 1970's . We are going to dump these woman hateing, child hateing upwardly mobile bitches into the first desert we find and see if they can make it like the women in Somalia,Sudan,Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Uyghur women do.  Without the US military industrial complex they can't do a damned thing. A bigger bunch of hypocrites you'll never find. They are evil because they destroy what we love most our families and our country.

91a8e11ad451c7891d7ab5f0dab8a125aa	Yes, I remember Leroy Anderson's works.  I have a CD of his music (he conducting the orchestra for those recordings.)  "Bugler's Holiday' has always been a favourite, and so are the catchy tunes, "Syncopated Clock" and "The Typewriter", It seems we don't hear much of his music these days, except for the Christmas holiday season when "Sleigh Ride" is played.  Of those, "Syncopated Clock" is my favourite because of the melody, the rhythm, the rich orchestration and, of course, the percussion.  A link to it is attached below.  Hopefully Leroy's music will enjoy a resurgence of popularity.|`|LcURWscBaa	Boy, do I remember!  As a veteran of military bands, we played many of his popular tunes.

Look how many musical geniouses<br>  we hear nothing or little of today, that are no longer around. Except<br>  for Beethovan and those of his caliber, who's music is timeless.<br>  Perhaps, if classical music becomes more popular in the future,<br>  some of his pieces might again be played to major audiences who<br>  demand his music be at the forefront again. I would think, that as<br>  long as there is a demand for his music, it will be played. Just like<br>  the Big Band era of music was so popular as well. Maybe it will <br>  again find a resurgance in appeal to young audiences just as it was<br>  during the late 30's and early 40's during the war years, and later.|`|fyrj50Braa	Sorry no, never heard of him.

Also she may have sisters or cousins that look like her and maybe have the same attributes that you found attractive.<br>  Consider yourself lucky to have met such a friend, and to have found out about her before you possibly embarrassed you both.<br>  She's not the only girl in the world, so as far as girlfriends go, you'll find your "perfect" match... when you least expect too.....

i2kBIb5jaa	Sit or sat? It's been a while but I'm pretty sure it's something along those lines.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	The other answers got the root correctly, but the verb is inflected to mean "he sat".

It would still be unethical to abort after the second trimester, before which we're talking about a lump of tissues with no thoughts and no personality. It would still be a choice that the two people involved in creating the lump of flesh would have to make, to allow the lump of flesh to grow into a human being, or to abort it before it gets to a stage of development that a rational person would consider it to be a person.. in fact, an early embryo is indistinguishable from the embryo of any other mammal (since the "blueprint" DNA for development is the same, this makes perfect sense). This decision should be based on whatever criteria the couple decides, as it's a personal decision to make.|`|ColDKgGuaa	I don't see why the mother would want to; basically the baby has no ties to her. But if she wants to terminate it  in this situation, then I think she should have before it is transplanted out. If this is not a choice, then no. I am mostly against abortion because of sexual abuse and the torment the poor girls will go through, but in this situation, I don't see why the fetus shouldn't be left alone.|`|i444oWjjaa	Yes; so long as it still resides in the woman's body it remains her choice. <br>  <br>  The whole point of Roe v Wade was to keep the government out of the process. Having new technology available does nothing to change the legal ramifications of abortion.|`|EczLqAIKaa	No, I'm pro-life now and in this scenario I would be even more pro-life.  The transplant of an unwanted child would be a win-win.  I've actually thought about writing a letter to the president to advocate research for such technology.|`|iu2hnHp7aa	Didn't you post this a few weeks ago?<br>  <br>  <br>  No, it wouldn't be ethical, BUT it isn't my, or your choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  I saw a question exactly like this a few weeks ago. Exactly.|`|0heO0q6uaa	Yes then no,kinda confusing question though. If a mother decides to take part in this then yes she is still basically choosing to abort. And I don't really know what you mean by taken out of the equation,but in either instance the answer to the second part is no. Where are you going with all of this? there is no such thing as a "fetus" just a very small human in the mommy's tummy, it's location and size do not disqualify it from being a human being. Adoption is not abortion if that is where you are going with this.

God does not want you to leave everything for him, but he wants you to leave everything for him! Isn't this confusing; it is, only if you read its apparent meaning.

Whenever we follow the desire of our heart, we must cross check with God's commandments and it is against his will, please abstain from it.

Even if it's with their consent - does not make it right! You are feeling what righteousness means. God did not design us to be happy - He designed us to be holy. One does not need to move into an ascetic lifestyle to do this. We are called to love one another, support one another and carry each others burdens without corrupting them or ourselves. <br>  This is a very hard thing to do. And it seems like sex gets in the way of all of it. <br>  People do not have affairs for the sex - they have affairs to be affirmed that they are a good person. Sex is just a byproduct to that end. People that use sex for their own questions are not mature at all. And it goes for both sides. <br>  Growing up does not mean being all frumpy and not having "fun". It's doing what is right without inflicting pain on other people. <br>  Why don't STD's go away?

If God existed, he wouldn't allow horrible things to happen to people he/she considers their "children". Giving people the option of having anger, hostility and resentment is like giving a 4 year old a toy ball and a loaded gun and saying "they should have the choice on what to use". It's ridiculous, and if God existed the difference in maturity and wisdom would be a lot bigger than an adult and 4 year old. Though people will always believe in a protective God, because it's in our nature to want to feel safe and protected.

You asked a perfectly legitimate Bible question and most of the people offer you nothing.  Let me share what I've learned from my Bible studies.<br>  <br>  We are in the middle of a big controversy started by Satan about WHO has the sovereignty or “right to rule”.  That was the whole thing in the Garden of Eden, Satan wanted their worship for himself.  Adam’s sin spread sin and death to all mankind (Romans 5:12)  but in the meantime, Satan was given an opportunity to try every type of government and method of ruling men; but he’s failed, obviously.  WE ARE NOT LEFT THERE   Dan 2:44 says “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin…...it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms (man’s governments just depicted in a dream to Nebuchadnezzer and interpreted by Daniel) and it itself will stand to times indefinite”  <br>  <br>  This kingdom began with cleansing the heavens first.  This has already happened.  Rev 12: 7-12 tells all about the war in heaven and how Satan was thrown down to earth, confined here, and he’s angry “knowing he has a short period of time”  Many scriptures make it clear that Satan is in charge right now temporarily.  (1 John 5:19, 2 Cor 4:4 2Tim 3:1-7)<br>  <br>  Keep in mind the whole time Jesus was on earth he preached God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind.  It’s even in the model prayer at Matt 6: 9-13 “Let your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven” KJ  This kingdom, with Jesus as its King, will fix everything.  This is not being naive.  Kindly, there will be some who are “bought from the earth” who will rule with him from heaven (Rev 14:1-4,1 Cor 15:20-24) but most will be on a paradise earth as originally planned . (Gen 1:28; Psalm 37:10,11,22, 29; Psalm 115:16; Isa 45:18 Habakkuk 2:14)  A resurrection is a part of the promise.  He assures us he knows and loves each of us well enough to know the number of hairs on our heads.<br>  <br>  Don’t you think the Creator of the universe is capable of wiping out any pain and bad memories?  The Bible says He will.  Isa 65:17 says “For here I am creating a new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.”<br>  <br>  The book “WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY TEACH?” has a chapter, “Why Does God Allow Suffering”  It will begin to answer your questions.  Don’t give up.<br>  <br>  You can get this book at a local Kingdom Hall, from one of Jehovah's Witnesses who calls on your home, or contact us through the website at www.watchtower.org<br>  <br>  Don’t lose heart|`|fgwzCiNWaa	Is God Pure, Good, Loving and Fair?<br>  <br>  If so, then where does evil, hatred and injustice <br>  come from?<br>  <br>  Allah tells us He is Pure, Loving, and absolutely Just in every respect. He says He is the Best of Judges. He also tells us the life we are in here is a test. He has created everything existing and He created whatever happens as well. There is nothing in this existence except what He has created. He also says in the Quran He created evil (although He is not evil). He is using this as one of the many tests for us.<br>  <br>  Consider people who do so much evil in the earth and then live to a ripe old age in the splendor and wealth of their ill-gotten gains and die without ever being taken to task for their deeds. Where is the justice or fairness in this? Allah provides a clear answer for us in Quran as to what is in store for these most evil of people:<br>  <br>  A brief enjoyment in this world! - and then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve [in Allah, belie His Messengers, deny and challenge His proofs, signs, verses, etc.][Noble Quran 10:70] <br>  <br>  That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds.<br>  So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.<br>  And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.[Noble Quran 99:6-8] <br>  <br>  Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: "We believe," and will not be tested.<br>  And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test).<br>  Or those who do evil deeds think that they can outstrip Us (i.e. escape Our Punishment)? Evil is that which they judge!<br>  Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allah, then Allah's Term is surely coming. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. <br>  And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allah is free of all wants from the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns, and all that exists). <br>  Those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism) and in Messenger Muhammad peace be upon him , and do not apostate because of the harm they receive from the polytheists], and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall reward them according to the best of that which they used to do. <br>  And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents, but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. <br>  And for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and other items of Faith) and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter in (the entrance of) the righteous (i.e. in Paradise). <br>  Of mankind are some who say: "We believe in Allah," but if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah's punishment, and if victory comes from your Lord, (the hypocrites) will say: "Verily! We were with you (helping you)." Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breast of the 'Alamin (mankind and jinns)? <br>  Verily, Allah knows those who believe, and verily, He knows the hypocrites [i.e. Allah will test the people with good and hard days to discriminate the good from the wicked (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)]. <br>  [Noble Quran 29:2-11]<br>  <br>  Reward and punishment are definitely a part of the Next Life on a very permanent basis. Those who suffer in this life and seemly have nothing to show for all their hard works, good deeds and sacrifices and maintaining the faith can look forward to a far greater reward in a place where these things will not be temporary but rather they will be for eternity. Those who corrupt, violate, injure and do evil and destruction seem to escape any justice here, yet in the Next Life they too will see the fruits of their labors, and certainly they will be paid according to what they have done as well. <br>  <br>  As regards oppression, this is something Allah forbids for Himself to do to anyone and He hates it when anyone oppresses someone else. He does have absolute power over everything. He allows sickness, disease, death and even oppression so we can all be tested in what we do.
TC0LmbG4aa	that is so awesome that you havemet all of those people and been to all of those places! i haven't even been out of the country:/
Mnm35sjNaa	That's what Genesis tells us.<br>  <br>  God gave us dominion over all the other animals of the world.  He gave us intelligence.  But he doesn't want us to use it.  His one warning to Adam and Eve was to keep their grubby hands off the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Furthermore, the entire Bible has not one word in praise of intelligence.<br>  <br>  The Bible is anti-intellectual.  It clearly portrays thinking as a bad thing that only leads to distancing yourself from (the biblical) God.<br>  <br>  And that is, in reality, the truth -- if you keep free will in mind.<br>  <br>  Free will cuts to the core of scriptural veracity and reveals the contradictions, ignorance and lies that dogma tries to cover up.<br>  <br>  The concept of free will wasn't really "fleshed out" until around 400 A.D., when St. Augustine developed a doctrine of free will to make man responsible for his own actions, as well as accountable to God.  This was centuries after the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) was written.  The Bible is so riddled with free will contradictions because its authors had no concept of free will.  Everybody in those days were entirely deterministic in their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Today, most Christian denominations proclaim free will as reality, despite the fact that the Bible is really deterministic.  Although there was no concept of free will in biblical times, some verses might nonetheless be construed as promoting free will -- but one would expect that to happen in any book written by humans.  Even if we believe everything is predestined, we also experience our plans and goals being met in a directed way.  We are always willing to accept credit for our accomplishments.  This is a tacit acknowledgment of free will, despite the lack of a free will doctrine.<br>  <br>  Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)    Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)    God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)    God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.<br>  <br>  I reject that neurosis!  I say most people are basically good but sometimes make mistakes.  We were created HUMAN, not saints or angels.  Any religion built on denying our nature is an unhealthy religion.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes.. we were immortal, but sin entered the World and now we are left with Death.. but in Christ we are redeemed !|`|AA12346187	probably  but  I  was not there.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	Adam and Eve were immortal before and after they ate of the forbidden fruit, just as we all are. <br>  <br>  We were part of God before creation and our immortal souls will continue to live on, either in heaven or in hell, after our physical death, depending upon the choices we make while still alive here on the Earth.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were not destined to die physically before they ate the forbidden fruit. They died spiritually when they disobeyed God and later died physically as well. <br>  <br>  In order to enter heaven and live eternally with God and Jesus our dead spirits must first be reborn. That was the purpose for Jesus Christ to step out of eternity, live here as a man, and offer Himself up as a sacrifice for all our sins.<br>  <br>  By accepting His sacrifice for us we are reborn spiritually and have the right to enter heaven when our physical bodies die. That is what is meant by being "born-again".|`|AA11992885	according to the texts of Genesis, nope, otherwise there would have been no reason for the tree of life to exist<br>  <br>  they could eat of either tree of their own choice<br>  the tree of life would maintain their lives<br>  the tree of knowledge would give them experience of both good and evil<br>  <br>  Genesis 3:22: And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, AND LIVE FOREVER:<br>  <br>  anyone saying that they were immortal before the sin, that shows they have NO KNOWLEDGE of the texts, and thus, there is no way they could possibly know if the OT and the NT go together or not<br>  <br>  this is the problem with all too many christians, they don't know the beginning, yet they claim to know the end|`|kF9aHWfUaa	I dont know but they were in heaven and everybody in heaven dont die but I still dont know.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No|`|0YQRbq9faa	No.  They were created innocent and with untested character.

They'd still be alive today if that was true. God prevented them from eating from the Tree of Life after they ate from the other tree. Read Genesis. However, if they had not sinned, God would have kept them alive (perhaps until he let them eat from the Tree of Life, at a time they would be ready for it). There would not have been a reason to evict them and they would have fulfilled their purpose (perfect).<br>  <br>  Death pays for all sins, and Adam and Eve were the first humans to sin. They were evicted from Eden and became imperfect, as in not meeting the purpose they were made for (due to their own choice). It was after that when they had intercourse and produced offspring, which  could only be imperfect, coming from imperfect people. The fact that death pays for all sins also means that we have no debt to anyone after we die.

Faith is what holds all matter together.There is nothing in there that I haven't heard before.He cannot say there is an end of something he has no knowledge of. Faith is not a religion or rituals. It is a spiritual force.It is the creative power of Almighty God.And we have this power in us, which lays dormant for most peoiple. But the few who have unlocked its principles it is a source of life.This fella may have been the death of your preconceived idea of what faith is, but it will never dent what we have .You are the one that is closed minded.Read the book of faith, the bible. Study what faith is, who has it, how it is released, and how it is planted.If you do not know these things, then how would you know if that fella would have convinced you of anything about real faith.
M3sVQm2Maa	Anybody who disbelieves in claims of the existence of a god is an atheist. It's as simple as that. No need to try and complicate it. <br>  Arguments about who is a "true" this or that is the realm of the religious.

qbQT7oMtaa	I tried rosetta stone for Spanish. It does not have any translation, grammar or conjugation instructions so it will be very hard to go beyond the basics with it. It is good for the basics as it is pure memorization. There is no way to be fluent with it. Their program is based on the same thing where you see these 4 pictures over and over again. I was disappointed especially for the price I paid. If you want to read Jules Verne, you would need to know much more than basic sentences and words.<br>  <br>  My college uses tell me more. My goal was to become fluent so it was perfect for me and I bought their individual version. It has a lot of different activities: picture/word association, videos, dialogues,..., includes also grammar and conjugation. It has also more content than any other language software. Their speech recognition is great so you can have a dialogue with the computer. You can contact them to get a free demo <a href="http://www.tellmemore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tellmemore.com</a> and also ask for a Rosetta Stone demo to compare, visit independent reviews websites(About.com, ...). <br>  <br>  The best way to learn a language would be through immersion, visiting these countries. Learning a language will require some time. In addition to software, you can have books which are useful as well. Audio CDs like Pimsleur for instance might help you out but you cannot get any feedback on your pronunciation so I did not like it so much|`|7uZrCkkVaa	HI, I like rocket spanish and the free podcasts from notesfromspain, both teach real spanish, not text book stuff, Eleanor|`|NxO58UJ1aa	y para que quieres aprender espa?ol tu mamita?<br>  <br>  and what for are you trying to learn spanish mamita?

Slang changes, colloquialisms are different from town to town, much less from country to country.  <br>  <br>  You should just concentrate on learning SPANISH.<br>  <br>  You can use livemocha.com....it's online, and free.<br>  <br>  As for talking/writing/communicating with spanish speakers, you could go to nosayudamos.com, sharedtalk.com, or any of a number of other sites where people just communicate with one another in an exchange of languages.
d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	It is like this:<br>  <br>  You can do whatever you like, just so long as it isn't hurtful to yourself or others.<br>  <br>  If you insist on doing evil, you will come out from under the governance of God, and come under the domination of an evil authority who will manipulate you to do his will.<br>  In fact, from your speech, it is evident to me that you are under his authority already.<br>  <br>  "Pleased to meet you,<br>  hope you guessed my name;<br>  but what's confusing you is,<br>  the nature of my game."<br>  <br>  from the Rollings Stones "His Satanic Majesty's Request"|`|iBcqLtT3aa	Yep, you got it.<br>  <br>  Now, what is your favorite flavor of Kool-Aid, please?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It's not rocket science mate.<br>  <br>  God gives you 2 choices:<br>  <br>  1- live for Him and His will<br>  <br>  2- live for yourself and your own will<br>  <br>  Now choose one and knock yourself out<br>  <br>  Sheeesh!|`|KILFoc6kaa	Romans 8:28 (New International Version)<br>  <br>  And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  God works through good and bad, in ALL things, therefore use your freewill. God will still work through those things for the good of all those who love him.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	You are supposed to use your free will to determine that god wants you to submit to his will.<br>  <br>  Apparently, if he hadn't set it up like this, then child-molesters wouldn't be able to use their free will to f**k children.<br>  <br>  Which would be bad... somehow.|`|iblT1HJpaa	WOW! You reached the place where all Christians HAVE to go. How does this work anyway? <br>  Do we have choice or is God manipulating us as puppets on a string? <br>  Scripture tells us both. <br>  If God is controlling all aspects of our lives - then there is no such thing as "free-will". Then where does evil come from? And pain? If God is such a loving God, then why does he allow us to sin? Then there must be free-will. But God knows our future - why would He "control" us into sin, death and destruction? <br>  There is no easy answer. One would normally seek God's insight into this dilemma through Scripture. Scripture goes both ways. No answer there. <br>  Perhaps the answer lies through prayer? <br>  Perhaps this is the truth about so much of Christianity? <br>  It's not about US trying to defend the Bible and religion, but in our seeking the truth from the One that is Truth. God does not want our intellect - he wants our hearts! <br>  (relationship!!!)|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No.  You're supposed to use your free will to choose to submit to God's will.  Life is much easier when you and God want the same things.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	That's one of the first major dilemmas of Genesis.<br>  <br>  God gave us dominion over all the other animals of the world.  He gave us intelligence.  But he doesn't want us to use it.  His one warning to Adam and Eve was to keep their grubby hands off the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Furthermore, the entire Bible has not one word in praise of intelligence.<br>  <br>  The Bible is anti-intellectual.  It clearly portrays thinking as a bad thing that only leads to distancing yourself from (the biblical) God.<br>  <br>  And that is, in reality, the truth -- if you keep free will in mind.<br>  <br>  Free will cuts to the core of scriptural veracity and reveals the contradictions, ignorance and lies that dogma tries to cover up.<br>  <br>  The concept of free will wasn't really "fleshed out" until around 400 A.D., when St. Augustine developed a doctrine of free will to make man responsible for his own actions, as well as accountable to God.  This was centuries after the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) was written.  The Bible is so riddled with free will contradictions because its authors had no concept of free will.  Everybody in those days were entirely deterministic in their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Today, most Christian denominations proclaim free will as reality, despite the fact that the Bible is really deterministic.  Although there was no concept of free will in biblical times, some verses might nonetheless be construed as promoting free will -- but one would expect that to happen in any book written by humans.  Even if we believe everything is predestined, we also experience our plans and goals being met in a directed way.  We are always willing to accept credit for our accomplishments.  This is a tacit acknowledgment of free will, despite the lack of a free will doctrine.<br>  <br>  Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)????Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)????God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)????God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.<br>  <br>  I reject that neurosis!  I say most people are basically good but sometimes make mistakes.  We were created HUMAN, not saints or angels.  Any religion built on denying our nature is an unhealthy religion.  Period.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|zQyslfHKaa	From what I can gather, God created you to live in a sinful world, so that his son would have to be slaughtered as payment for sin.  A requirement that he himself created, and oh by the way he is his own son.<br>  <br>  Hilarity.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	this is what i call the calvinist myth. its rediculous really. there are several examples in the Bible that say otherwise. i would give you every one but id be here forever.|`|aHEwm3QLaa	Actually, the Christian Free Will could not exist at all. God set up everything already. No matter what, things will go as he had planned. NOTHING can deviate from the plan. Therefore, the Christian free will does not exist|`|zUMvC6QEaa	You have the freedom to choose or reject God's will. God respects the freedom of his creatures.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	No remember...He wants you to use it the way HE WANTS....which is funny cause he's suppose to be all power and everything yet he doesn't really have all that power....funny...lol|`|31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	God and the Godfather... not different enough.|`|fy7gxCGFaa	Apparently you are born with free will but only so you can use it to do exactly what God wants. He also apparently created his own system of rules that involves having his only son being killed and sending people that he supposedly created and loves to be tortured for all eternity. Sounds like a nice guy to me.|`|Khw6v2Gcaa	No! He wants to lead us, but....<br>  <br>  Let me put it this way.<br>  <br>  Your driving a car with a Man. Your driving towards the very far away perfect city. Every now and then a crazy truck drives straight at you and you land in the ditch. The Man asks you if He can drive. You let Him. He makes the trucks go to their side of the road by continuing camly like it wasn't there. Then some amuzement park is next to the straight road. You take over the driving (the Man easily lets you drive again, you know its safer and He should be driving, but you want to.) and end up nearly going over a cliff. The Man takes over driving again and you are safe as long as He drives, but you are always allowed to choose to drive again.<br>  <br>  Make any sense?|`|bwigyPMTaa	He says what's best for you to choose, and hopes you do. He is not forcing you to it. If you choose to do his will, to do good, then it means you've learned that his will is good for us, it shows his love, and that your own will or any man's will, leads to trouble. It gives your relationship with God meaning. If he just forced everyone to his good will then bad wouldn't exist and there wouldn't really be a relationship. We would just be unappreciative dependent robots that take everything for granted. Once you learn that, it will be YOU who chooses to listen to God. YOU will have used your free will. Note that He wants YOU to make the choice. To make a choice out of your own motivation you will have to understand what each one means. That includes understanding why his will is always better than yours. Then you have reason to choose for Him, and it will have meaning to you and to God.<br>  <br>  On the lighter subjects where your will doesn't combat with God's you can do your own will... like will you eat an apple or an orange.. hmmm..  that's up to you. Within God's laws is plenty of room to use your will and follow a desire.|`|AAAw24KOaa	Here's an excellent illustration.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUtSM2oVy_E&feature=PlayList&p=FB216AE37D295F90&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUtSM2oVy...</a>|`|VHa5PIfpaa	God gave you a free will and He really does want you to use it.  The fact that you are even asking this question is proof of that.<br>  <br>  Choose... God or the world...  It's up to you.  God will love you either way.|`|Jd5rm61Uaa	The whole idea about free will in Christianity is that God has given you a choice to accept him (thus using your free will to act out his plan), or reject him (using your free will to choose not to obey the principals of Christianity).|`|4vOKQ0YKaa	no god gave u free will so that u could make choices for yourself, good or bad. he gave u free will so u could decide on your own to fallow him or not. god wants us to worship him because we want to not because hes forcing us to.|`|EAix5Av9aa	The free wil to sin or abide in Christ is one God allows us to do.<br>   "We all sin and fall short of the glory of God".<br>  " By grace we are saved through faith, not of ourselves lest any man boast"<br>     The Lod lives let us bless the Lord. Baruch ha Shem.<br>     Free will is what hinders our growth,salvation and the pride we bear in not allowing God and his humity of Christ to bear witness as an ensample of Christ.<br>      Paul clearly gives us the understanding ion the epistles.

She identifies with the male gender more than the female gender. Gender is only "roles" we play depending on our sex. It's when culture or society delegate role's to people according to their genitals... For example: women are "supposed" to be feminine, so they should stay home and be housewives.. men are "suppossed" to be masculine, so they should go to work and be the bread winners. <br>  <br>  She's still a female. But if she's attracted to men, then she's heterosexual. Trans gender doesn't determine sexual orientation. It just means she isn't living her lifestyle as society expects her to. Maybe it's mens clothes she finds appealing, or the hair cuts, however doesn't mean she's gay..|`|mCpC4Zjbaa	I would be careful not to label him at all if you are his friend.

AA11272456	No, it is not true that Lazarus was not resurrected.  That was a bit awkward.  Let me restate:  Lazarus was resurrected from the dead just as Jesus was resurrected from the dead.  Was Lazarus awakened?  As if from sleep?  The man was not napping.  At John 11:14, we read Christ's candid words:  "So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.""<br>  <br>  What means this term resurrection? Doesn't it mean rising from the dead?  Yes!  What of those who say he was merely awakened; or that he was not resurrected to heavenly life or to eternity?  The quality of his resurrection is neither discussed nor mentioned in the Bible.  And it is beside the point, anyway.  Resurrection means a standing up - from the dead.  Thus, how long the resurrection lasts, how long it took, where it occurs, how long the person had been dead, or the final destination of the resurrected one is neither here nor there.  So it is misleading to suggest that, because Lazarus was not resurrected to eternity (he in fact died again), he somehow did not experience a resurrection.  That would mean that Jesus is a liar.  <br>  <br>  Jesus was resurrected to eternal life in the heavens; Lazarus was resurrected to (temporary) life on earth; so in this connection his resurrection did not match the resurrection of Jesus.  But that does not mean Lazarus was not resurrected.  Plainly he was dead.  And plainly, the remedy for death is resurrection.<br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|AA10988107	After Jesus died and ascended, Lazarus could have been anointed<br>  on the day of Penecost to eventually be in heaven with Jesus.<br>  I say eventually because Jesus is at God's right hand until<br>  Rev.12:3,4,6,7-12 is accomplished, Satan and 1/3 angels are cast down, after John 3:13-15, none go to heaven but Jesus until enemies are cast down to footstool earth as to prophecy, Matt.22:42-44; Acts 2:27-31; Heb.1:1-13 [ these enemies must be underfeet on footstool earth ], then as is<br>  expected, Rom.16:20, John 6:39,40,44, 14:3, a place is<br>  prepared for the raised up that will be with Jesus as he prayed for John 17:1-26, Dan.12:1-9,10-13, Michael in the<br>  time of the end cast Satan and 1/3 angels down, he is there<br>  to the very last, 1Thes.4:15-17, to the caught up to be with<br>  Jesus.

Today, people die and are able to come back. The time that people stay dead are being extended. One woman, recently, came back as the doctors were asking the family what to do with the remains. There is an industry that will freeze the brain, in case, the future can return these people. Jesus was different, his body was material and immaterial at the same time. This is out of the possibilities of any future science, at this time.|`|0WuoC5xIaa	Lazarus was resurrected.<br>  <br>  Accout at John chapter 11 tells us that there were many witnesses when Lazarus was ressurected.

Even the unbeatable death is under his control.|`|e7304a95864d064998cb6153f4d52b91aa	No, Lazarus was resurrected. The Bible clearly says he was dead and had lain in his tomb several days before Jesus came to bring him back from the dead.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	the passover plot claims it was a trance but if either were actually dead and resurrected can you imagine the kind hangover that would ensue .

Lazarus was smelly dead by the time Jesus got round to bringing him back to life. Jesus deliberately lingered so that the miracle would bring glory to God. If he had just woken him up from a coma, how would that glorify God? So convinced were the eyewitnesses that Lazarus had been resurrected, Jesus' enemies sought to kill both him and Lazarus (the evidence). (John 11:1-53 & 12:10)<br>  <br>  The fundamental difference between Lazarus's resurrection and Jesus Christ's  is stated in this scripture: Col 1:18 "And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence." Jesus is the firstborn from the dead. But hang on a minute! That cannot mean he was the first to be raised from the dead, because He wasn't! This is not speaking of a numeric 'first'. It speaks of preeminence - priority - first, in the sense of importance. No-one has ever had a resurrection like Jesus's. Why? Because His resurrection was unique. He did not deserve to die because He had committed no sin "The wages of sin is death" says the Bible. But Jesus was perfect. Therefore death had no claim on Him. Only sinners are held by death! So by Jesus sacrificing His perfect life to pay the price of sin, the way was then opened for all who put faith in that provision to have their sins forgiven. That ensures they will be resurrected to life everlasting.<br>  <br>  That is what "firstborn" means here. It never means "created" when applied to Jesus in the Bible. This is what legs so many people down. They are limited by their own understanding of what the modern meaning is and do not consider the biblical meaning and the sense of the Greek word used. If the Bible wanted to say Jesus was created, it would have used the Greek word for that, 'protoktistos'. It never applies that word to Jesus. It only every uses 'prototokos' which refers to priority, preeminence, uniqueness. I know from your answer to the Q you referred us to that you believe Jesus was created; I pray to God my answer will speak to your heart and your mind - for Jesus' sake.|`|1nVRMObiaa	Lazarous was brought back to life with the same physical body he had before he died. (Think of it as a reversal of the process of departing from this earth). Jesus Christ arose with a glorified body, which everyone who dies in Him will be resurrected with when Christ returns. The two resurrections are very different; Lazarous resurrected only to die again later but Christ resurrected once and for all never to die again. Christ is the first one to resurrect with a glorified body. Do everything in ur power to ensure u die in Him so that u r part of the family of believers to resurrect with glorified bodies.|`|ICGxM45qaa	Your question doesn't make any sense because Jesus was never resurrected.

IYF4xSTdaa	I don't know and do not want to know..|`|QaT680QHaa	There may be some but the reputable ones (that I know) are not in it for the money|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	There are some reputable spellcasters online, yes -- the trouble is that there are so many fakes that it can be hard to distinguish who is who (especially since some clever fakes will even take up the names of well-known spellcasters with good reputations.)<br>  <br>  A lot of people will declare anyone who casts a spell that doesn't work to be a scammer, but my own criteria is they are a scammer only if they take the money and don't do anything OR provide false or misleading information designed to make you either buy more things from them or have more spells cast.<br>  <br>  However, a good spellcaster is one that tends to get results -- and since often the only way to know if the spell will get results is to do a divination first, a lot of the best casters won't do anything unless you buy readings from them first, which can be discouraging to new clients. <br>  <br>  Now, I will also add that not every spellcasting traditon thinks it is moral to charge money for spells -- many Wiccans, for example, seem to feel this way. However, in other traditons, such as hoodoo, Santeria and Voodoo, this is a common way to arrange such services, particularly as they tend to be ingredient-heavy. It's good to know a thing or two about the spellcasting traditions you are looking into, even if you just expect to hire a caster, as it can really help identify the frauds (anyone who claims to be a Vodun caster but says they do their spells by invoking Satan, for example.)|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Reputable people would not do spells for money, only for urgent need, though they might be willing to accept a donation, especially if it cost them money to do.

Nor will they cast curses.|`|an1b4pXxaa	You will find the reputable witches right next to the dry water.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Hmmmm....okay - so folks here are saying that reputable witches would not charge at all for their services.  Are we so sure about that?  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying these online sites that sell "love spells" for like $400 a whack are legit - that is absolute rubbish.  <br>  <br>  But, if a witch's time and energy were in demand - would he/she not need to be farily compensated?  I took magic classes from some experienced witches in my area who have good reputations, and I paid for my courses.  One local witch I knew became in such high demand for teaching witchcraft classes, that for him to put the appropriate time and energy into it, he didn't have time for a regular "day job" - so of course, he's got to charge a reasonable fee for classes to compensate him for his time and efforts as a teacher.  Witches are people too - we have to eat, and we have bills to pay, just like everyone else.<br>  <br>  Now, that being said, you may find services listed through "The Witches Voice" <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a><br>  <br>  And you should treat it just as you would any other person with specialty skills that you would hire to do a job for you (like a plumber, contractor, etc.), you would check their references.<br>  <br>  I have had coworkers ask for my assistance in casting a spell for them - if I can do it for free, I am happy to do so - but sometimes money's tight for me too.  The last time a coworker asked for my help, she wanted a couple of actual ingredients with the spell - which she gave me the money for.  I see nothing wrong with being compensated for your expenses in cases like that.<br>  <br>  Just as an FYI - "warlock", in the witchcraft community, tends to translate to "oath breaker" and is referring to one who has betrayed their coven.  A witch is a witch, male or female.|`|QMmDVjNraa	No, true witches don't advertise there abilities online to get a profit from it.

If you find someone and they don't look Native than do not trust them. I don't care what anyone says, this is true. There are too many people out there that are fakes and out for a quick buck. Also, they are very modest and there are not many left. They would never do anything to draw attention to themselves or attract too much attention or notoriety. For example, I am very traditional, full blooded Native and I don't even know any medicine men. I don't want to discourage you because they are out there. Your best bet is to ask any Natives that you know if they know one. It is there choice, whether they will speak with you or not and they will tell you what they need, make a note It will not be money.

tI1NHwfBaa	A couple of important points about your question.<br>  <br>  You do not need to be religious to be moral.  This is an extremely important point!  If you needed religion to be moral, your morals would come from something outside of you, and it would be clear that religion is the source of morality.  <br>  <br>  But that's not the case.  We all know how we should behave.  If you study any global culture from any time frame, you'll find that morals are very similar.  Rape, child abuse, etc. are really wrong.<br>  <br>  But there's some huge implications to this.  We know how we should behave.  We all have generally the same standard.  Yet we don't always behave the way we think we should.  Our behavior can't be attributable to a herd instinct -- otherwise it wouldn't be a struggle for us to follow it.  Objective moral values imply that God exists.<br>  <br>  Secondly, whether or not you personally believe in a hell is irrelevant to the question of whether or not you can end up in such a place.  If there is a God and our behavior matters, then hell is a real possibility, whether you agree or not.  We don't opt in or opt out of heaven or hell or anything else that truly exists by our beliefs.<br>  <br>  These two points are why Jesus Christ is so important.  He atones for our failure to be the kind of person we should be, and reconciles us to God.  With Christ, we don't need to question whether or not hell exists -- because we won't be there.<br>  <br>  When others share this with you, I assure you it's not because they want to look down on you -- it's because they're concerned about you.|`|q6H2ru3waa	It is not enough to be just "good". you were told you have to be saved, this is true, if you are not yet saved, yes your soul will be lost. Mark 10:17-18 states;  And when he(a sinner) was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, God Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?  18) And Jesus said unto him Why callest me good? there is none good but one, that is God. John 3:16; For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believe in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.  You have to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ who died for your sins.  God bless.|`|r8rykCkGaa	They are digging their own graves spiritually speaking.|`|TjwgBFCzaa	It matters not to me if people believe in a God, Gods or Goddess.   I am only responsible for myself.|`|26DoxkOBaa	Ya, that's offensive and harsh to be told by a religious person that you're going to go to hell. I would never say that, because I don't know if that's true for you or not. I don't think going to heaven or hell depends on what you believe. I suggest that when someone asked you what you believe, just say no comment. People shouldn't be asking you personal things like that, and it's just ill-mannered and very rude.<br>  <br>  If atheists don't believe in God they don't need to broadcast it. It's like when they do that, they're trying to get a believer to stop believing, too, which is just as violent as a Christian telling you you'll go to hell. The religious category isn't really for atheists. Why would it be? And when they get on it, all they can do is discredit theists, and what's the point of that?|`|KILFoc6kaa	I have friends and family members that are Atheists. Very nice, very kind people who are open minded, caring and not murderers, rapists, etc... <br>  <br>  <br>  While I wish they were Christians, all I can really do is lead my life as a testament to Jesus Christ, as the bible tells me to live to the best of my ability, I do not hate Atheists, and its not my place to judge.  <br>  <br>  I think that shoving my beliefs down someones throat is counter productive, I think that trying to force my religion on people is counter productive. If someone asks me I will answer, but I am not going to beat someone over the head with a bible until they believe, goodness knows that's not how I was saved, it actually turned me away from God for a long time.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  I feel genuine compassion and concern for atheists.  I don't hate atheists.<br>  <br>  I think you showed a logical flaw in your last sentence.  You seem to be saying that people shouldn't warn you about Hell because you don't believe in that.   The existence of Hell is not a product of your belief.   Your beliefs do not establish the existence or non-existence of Hell or anything else.  <br>  <br>  I'm pointing this out to you because I think many atheists are significantly disabled by pride.  Perhaps I am making too much out of the last line of your question,  but it seems to me that your words indicate that you think your beliefs have some effect on reality.  Hell either does or does not exist.  Your beliefs are not the cause of the existential status of Hell.  <br>  <br>  I suspect,  from your words,  that you might actually operate on an underlying pride-filled belief that your beliefs have a causal effect on the Universe.   Your beliefs are not that consequential - neither are mine.  But our beliefs do have a significant effect on ourselves.   Christians warn you about Hell out of compassion.   I'm responding to you now for the same reason - compassion,  and I'm also warning you that Hell is real.  <br>  <br>  We all may ignore important parts of reality - at least during our Earthly lives,  but we don't get to actually invent our own special version of reality.   We can pretend,  but reality is not dependent on our personal thoughts.  Although we can ignore things now, we will not be able to do so for eternity.  After your earthly life,  there will be no option of avoiding The Truth. <br>  <br>  I hope and pray that you come to accept the Truth before you die.<br>  Please try to keep in mind how concerned a sincere Christian would be if he or she thought you were in grave danger of spending eternity in Hell.   Christians are not rotten people for warning you about what we genuinely believe to be a grave danger.  If we did not warn you,  that would be rotten of us.  <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:   Thanks for taking my answer seriously.   You say you have had near death experiences,  and that you have always had to save yourself.   How do you give yourself life?    I think you might enjoy reading the autobiography of G.K.

If you would tolerate my enthusiasm for God without prejudice then why should I pounce on you for your disbelief?<br>  <br>  Honestly I do not think Atheist = immoral or evil  or disrespectful.  I love you as a fellow human being.  You sound very rational and intellectual.  My mentor, past boss, and very dear friend is an atheist and we have mutual love and respect for each other.<br>  <br>  You sound like a very interesting human being so I will watch for future questions you have.  It has been a pleasure to write to you.<br>  <br>  By the way your Avatar is cute but may I ask why you selected the moniker anonymous because you are definitely not!  You are a complete package of sagacity and panache!  I like you - you are a breath of fresh air.<br>  <br>  Ultimately I am responsible for my own salvation and taught to inculcate those who seek to understand my faith, but you clearly have a destination in mind that is unlike what I would choose, but that does not make me right and you wrong.  I have to answer to God for my own belief system.  There are some truths that I don't question and take on faith because of experience from elders.  For example, when I was young, My folks told me not to stick my fingers in a light socket or I would get hurt.  I trusted what they had to say and smartly learned in high school the concept of electricity and why I was not to stick my finger in a socket.  We had one of those electrical balls in science class that when you touched it you felt a slight jolt, but if you could manage to keep your hand on the ball your hair would straighten out!  We all laughed at how silly we looked but then our teacher told us that larger jolts of electricity could kill so I did not question this belief after having played with the minor jolt from the low wattage device.  That is not to say that I believe everything someone tells me, but if it makes logical sense and the data is there to support it then I would be a moron to electrocute myself to test this theory.<br>  <br>  I am a surgeon so I have learned how things work together in the human body, but some things I had to accept on faith by clinical instructors who knew what they were talking about.<br>  <br>  Christian belief system is based on faith and is a whole different issue in my book!  The fact that you do not believe in God does not in any fashion negate my belief that there is a God, but as I said since there is not scientific proof to go along with my belief system then your belief that he does not exist is just as valid as my belief that he does.  This may sound like a sweeping generalization but I find many atheists like you to be deep thinkers and that excites me to ask you questions if you are willing.  Well done.  Good question.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I have no problems with atheists.  Many of my friends our atheists.  They shake their heads when I tell them I'm still a Christian, but we respect each others decisions to believe what we believe.<br>  <br>  Religious people try to save you because they believe Hell is a reality.  Not believing in something does not make it any less real, so religious people want to protect you from what they think is foolishness.  I admit I sometimes feel guilty for not doing more to try to save my friends from Hell.  However, they already know everything I would say, so I don't see the point in badgering them with an ideology they don't believe in and I can't prove.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	I don't dislike anyone because they are an atheist, gay, loudmouth, drug addict or prom queen.

They are good people, I trust them to watch my kids, use good judgement about what movies, videos the kids can watch (more of an issue when they were younger), and I enjoy their company.<br>  I believe God loves all people, and that includes atheists. I would like my friends to see God's love shining through me so that they may come to know him, but I leave the conversion stuff up to God. Jesus has been saving people for a couple of thousand years before I came along, and he didn't try to force belief on anyone, so I don't either. If your friends are saying you need to be saved, it's just because they really care about you and want you to know God like they do. They may be pushy, but it not because they don't respect you- they're just eager to share their faith.|`|VHa5PIfpaa	Christians don't HATE anyone.  We dislike... don't appreciate... become annoyed with... the things SOME of the atheists do.<br>  <br>  As for the good atheists...  well, we love them... but it's kind of a shame that they will not enter the kingdom of Heaven after they die because if I'm going (and I deserve to go to heaven less than 90% of the people on this website...) then it would be a shame if such awesome people were to live out their lives as such and then spend eternity in Hell.  How not fair is that?!<br>  <br>  Edit for Jared and every other atheist in here:  We DO love you... if you only knew how MUCH!...  It's why we're all constantly praying for you guys and wanting the best for you... you're good people and we care about you!|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	Everyone likes to feel important.  And religious people are no different.  People are judgemental about atheits because it feels nice and its super easy to point your finger at an entire group of people and say 'I am better than them.  My exsistance matters, and theirs doesn't'.  Plus, a lot of Christians like to take facts that are stated in the Bible that they like and ignore the ones that interfere with their lives.  Like, for instance, blasphemy is wrong.  Jesus said it was wrong.  But Jesus also said to love everybody (even you atheists, who commit blasphemy by denying His existance), and to treat everyone as you would like to be treated.  But I don't know, I suppose that particular verse gets in the way of all that finger pointing they enjoy so much.  I know it doesn't come off as if I am a Christian, but I am... and I try very hard to live my life as the Bible says.  And people who call themselves 'Christians', but do crap like this, are extremely annoying.

PzkGIlPRaa	Yeah your mom has a point asian females are less demanding, but also there is a extreme attracrive quality for white men that asian women stimulate, and I think it has to do with the small size and very thick long black hair. I am a tall white male, but when it comes to women I don't look at what race they are, but if there attractive and have a good personality.|`|yvWIt3Ubaa	Because they are also told that, "White man have money". Therefore, they go where they believe the money is.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	ur mother is right..<br>  like for i did notice Asian women aren't demanding at all, and it's like they kind of agree and worship (no offense) any other man that isn't Asian like h's a gift or something..<br>  and men obviously love that..<br>  they wouldn't want us Caucasian ladies who they assume would give them a headache and be more demanding then ever..<br>  we also tend to stand up for ourselves not like Asian women they just obey their men..<br>  <br>  so i guess men are trying to live a relaxed life now by picking an Asian partner ..|`|EdC9JfIQaa	I had a friend of mine explain this to me one day.  People have a survival instinct both as an individual and as a race.  Their basic nature is to have sex with someone that is very different from them so that the offspring will be more apt to survive.  (This is why brothers and sisters aren't supposed to have sex-genetic mutations.)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, social mores say that you are supposed to marry someone like you.  Therefore, although you might be attracted to one person due to survival, you end up with somone else due to social pressure. <br>  <br>  However, over the last 100 years or so, travel has become easier and social mores have become more relaxed. As a result, you are now seeing more "mixed" couples simply because the times are changing.|`|OnwijTc3aa	Asian women tend to try and please their man more than a Caucasian woman does.  Americans have typically brought up the woman to be an equal to the man.  In eastern countries women are sought to be the housekeeper and mainly the "servant" if you will.  The male ego tends to make us men think that we are rulers of this earth and our woman needs to be our backbone.  Asian women sure do this job well :).|`|D9k5Fou5aa	If you want stability, respect, put pride away, educated, fair, etc....you're more likely to find it in Asian women. White women are very demanding and act like they're entitled to everything. I know that a lot of Asian women seem to be going for guys for money...but when they struggle financially, majority of the time, they stick by their men. Asian women are like the glue that keeps family together. Asian women rather give up their happiness to keep their children happy. White women rather break up family so they can sleep with other men.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Your Mom is right about them coming from their homeland to one of ours, I know a large number of Philippine women who have come to the U.S. because a caucasian guy here went over and married them, brought them back.

The second coming of Christ when he  returns along with his heavenly army consisting of Angels, People who went to Glory before the rapture and people who were raptured. <br>  <br>  Its impossible to know what one would be doing for either event and I’m not sure it matters when the Lord returns for his church only they (anyone who happens to see someone just vanish) will know, but when he returns the second time everyone will know Believer and non-believer a like.

SicJ7utMaa	It's from indian:<br>   <br>  Manglik / Kuja Dosham is a criteria determined by the position of the stars at the time of your birth. It is generally calculated using the date of birth, time of birth and the Janam Patri (Horoscope). <br>  <br>  Manglik generally implies that there are some negative forces of matrimony that influence your life. In the case of Hindu weddings, it is preferred if a Manglik boy enters into a matrimonial alliance with a Manglik girl and vice versa, the theory being that 2 negative make a positive. The Manglik option is important to only those people who are particular about horoscopes.<br>  <br>  Help?
Mnm35sjNaa	You asked: these are my honest opinions, with my reasons.<br>  <br>  I see the followers of LDS (as with any religion) as normal people who believe a lie.  However, I see the church itself as a fraud and as racist, from the beginning.<br>  <br>  This true story tells why . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin' at my door.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus accepts worship.  Jesus calls himself the things that God calls himself.<br>  <br>  Clearly Jesus believed that he was God.<br>  <br>  Mormons reject this belief, and follow a book that has no historical and archaeological support the way the Bible does.  They adulter the gospel and preach something different than what Jesus taught.<br>  <br>  The world does not look upon them with admiration for rejecting Christ and adding to and changing his words.  The Christian world does not consider Mormons to be Christians, because they reject the diety of Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  Mormons, though they mean well and are completely sincere end up misleading people, they irritate others, they make Christians look bad, they prejudice others against Christ and his message.<br>  <br>  I feel great sorrow for them.

The majority of Americans (let's make that the majority of the world, actually) mostly ignore you, and if it wasn't for the for the fact that you keep ringing their doorbells and bothering them during dinner, they probably wouldn't even know (or care) that you guys exist.  <br>  <br>  Most people don't think you're evil, and don't particularly respect you, either.

They will corrupt the bible if they will be permitted to live in the first century just to conform with their own precept.

It concerns me that the LDS church preaches another gospel besides the New Testament.  The works-righteousness and meritocracy of the LDS church concerns me.  It concerns me that in the heaven of the LDS church, people are not united, but remain separated, segregated, and isolated from each other by levels.  It concerns me that in the LDS church, you can earn your way into heaven, and earn your way to higher levels of heaven.  <br>  <br>  It concerns me that the LDS church calls itself Christian but is not upfront about its beliefs with outsiders.  It concerns me that the LDS church founded within the last two hundred years declares apostasy Christian beliefs and traditions held for two thousand years.  It concerns me that the LDS Church is certain that it has the "correct" and "true" revelation of Jesus Christ, but that I as a Christian outside the LDS Church do not.  It concerns me that that only members of the LDS church are allowed in LDS temples once they are dedicated.  It concerns me that this and other teachings/practices reverse almost all of the teachings of Jesus Christ that I know of from the New Testament.  It concerns me that the LDS people who I have known are not upfront with their beliefs.  It concerns me that the LDS church seems to steadily chip away at the rights of other Christians.  I note the recent flood of money from across the nation funneled into California to manipulate a state election and force LDS beliefs about marriage upon other Christians, to deprive other Christians of civic rights because they did not agree with LDS beliefs. <br>  <br>  I don't know whether most Americans see the LDS church as evil, but I do know that perception is not necessarily reality.  I do know for certain that when other people talk of putting people who don't agree with them "in their place," I am given cause for great, great concern.  Power is not evil, but domination and oppression is.

zBqt99avaa	2:62, as already quoted by others, is pretty clear.  I find it interesting how many people would like to re-interpret this passage to mean something else, to deny heaven to others.  God alone decides.<br>  <br>  IF what God meant was only those Christians alive before the advent of Islam He would surely have said so.  If He meant non-Muslims had to accept the Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) He certainly would have said that too.  But He did not.<br>  <br>  The truth is, regardless of what one would like personally, if one believes in the Quran, they have to accept that Christians and people of other faiths who believe in one God, the day of judgement and live a righteous life, have as much chance at heaven as Muslims.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	No.<br>  <br>  Christianity is this:<br>  <br>  Complete faith and utter trust in God and His salvation through the sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Christians do not believe Muhammad is a prophet of God.<br>  <br>  Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God, the Lamb of God, the Word of God, and the Right Arm of God.<br>  <br>  If a person calls themselves a "Christian" but does not believe these things, then that person isn't even following their own holy scriptures.<br>  <br>  (By the way, the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are not monotheists...they are henotheists.)|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you.

People like Mother Teresa or Martin Luther King Jr. were Christians and they did more than I could ever do!<br>  <br>  The Quran states:<br>  <br>  Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians -- whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve" (2:62, 5:69)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hadeeth states:<br>  <br>  The Holy Prophet (pbuh) has said: <br>  "Whoever does good, whether a Muslim or an unbeliever, God will reward him." His Holiness (s) was asked: 'What is rewarding an unbeliever like?' The Holy Prophet (s) replied: "If they have had regard for kinship or given alms or done any good, God Almighty would grant them wealth, children, and health in reward to their good deeds." He was (further) asked: 'How will they be rewarded in the Hereafter?' The Holy Prophet (s) replied: "They will receive less severe punishment.

There can be no way to reality and salvation outside his mighty highway. Nevertheless, a most important aspect is this: non-acceptance is one thing, while the acceptance of non-being is another. Ecstatics and recluses or those who have not heard or do not know, do not know the Prophet or they do not think of him so that they should accept him. They are ignorant in that respect. They only know There is no god but God in regard to knowledge of God. They may be among those who will be saved. But if those who have heard of the Prophet and know his message do not affirm him, they do not recognize Almighty God. For them, the phrase There is no god but God alone does not express the affirmation of Divine Unity, which is the means of salvation. For that is not ignorant non-acceptance, which may be excusable to a degree, it is rather the acceptance of non-being, which is denial. A person who denies Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace), who with his miracles and works was the pride of the universe and glory of mankind, certainly can in no respect receive any light and will not recognize God.<br>  Furthermore,in the end of times (ahirzaman),since the religion of Islam has been veiled ;there would be a salvation for innocent and oppressed Christians if they had not received the message of Muhammad PBUH.<br>  Allah knows the best.|`|nWB0NC9Iaa	2:62 Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.<br>  <br>  Does this verse refer to present day christians/jews who uphold the Bible/torah, and ANYBODY who believes in God, and the last day? Can the Trinitarians still go to heaven? OR does this verse refer to the unitarian Christians? What about the polytheists/atheists? Please tell me who can go to heaven, according to this verse. Thanks for your time.<br>  <br>  Salam<br>  Answer - <br>  Theologians have much debated these kind of verses in the Quran. There is still no general consensus among the Ulama on this issue. Since the revelation of this verse many developments have taken place in the monotheist religions and Muslim scholars also learned more about other religions.<br>  <br>  It is therefore difficult to give you a clear-cut answer that would reflect all opinions according to tradition. Especially the distinctions you make regarding the Christian tradition is  very complex.<br>  <br>  If one goes by the most liberal interpretation -- which in my view should be adhered to in our multicultural world -- all those who uphold believe in one God, the last day AND acts in a moral fashion should receive their just reward<br>  <br>  thank you, for the reply. But, aren't there quranic verses which state that, one cannot choose a religion other than Islam? And that those who deny Allah's revelation will be cast into hellfire/and other verse of the like?<br>  <br>  salam|`|423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	Those who do not believe in Islam can be classified into two groups:<br>  <br>  1. Those who are termed ‘Jahil-e-Muqassir’ (lit. ‘culpable ignorant’). These are non-believers to whom the message of Islam has reached and who have understood its truthfulness. However, they are not prepared to accept the truth due to their obstinacy and stubbornness. This group deserves to be punished in Hell.<br>  <br>  2. Those who are termed ‘Jahil-e-Qasir’ (lit. ‘inculpable ignorant’). These are non-believers to whom the message of Islam has not reached, or it has been presented to them in a very incomplete and untruthful manner. Such people will attain salvation if they are truthful to their own religion.|`|IxOP4qbYaa	No, Christians do not go to heaven because they believe that Jesus is God's son which is called shirk. Muslims believe in only one God, Allah, and that He alone is the Creator of the universe.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	The verses 2:62 and 5:69 state that the MINIMUM criteria for redemption are:<br>  <br>  1-  Believe in God and the last day<br>  2-  Righteousness.<br>  <br>  It is true for ANYONE i.e. Muslim, Jews, Christians, Sabiens, ANY other faith.<br>  <br>  However, the lacuna here is :  "Believe in God" and "Righteousness"<br>  <br>  God ALSO tells us that God can forgive ALL sins EXCEPT "Shirk" i.e. setting partner to God. Ref. 4:116<br>  <br>  4:116<br>  GOD does not forgive idol worship (if maintained until death), and He forgives lesser offenses for whomever He wills. Anyone who idolizes any idol beside GOD has strayed far astray.<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  The translators have translated the "Shirk" as "idol worship" as there is no corresponding word in English. Shirk is setting partner to God.<br>  <br>  Now at first site this may appear to be clear. But it is again a lacuna. Because the serious student of the Quran KNOW that Shirk is NOT just verbally stating that someone has an authority besides God. OR someone is a son of God etc. etc.<br>  <br>  It means, ANYONE who acquires a greater priority in obedience, compared to God. i.e.<br>  <br>  It can be:<br>  <br>  1-  Our wealth<br>  2-  Status<br>  3-  Our Job, or business<br>  4-  Efforts and work<br>  5-  A religious figure or politician<br>  6-  A theory or philosophy.<br>  7-  Children<br>  8-  Parents<br>  <br>  ANYTHING that acquires a priority that exceeds the obedience and allegiance to God is "Shirk" or setting up partner to God.<br>  <br>  Now as far as the Christians go and the verse 2:62 and 5:69 are concerned. We can see that the criteria is laid down and simple. However, one has to look into a few other things before arriving at a decision:<br>  <br>  1-  Ref. 5:17, 5:72 and 73<br>  In these verses God is stating that those who say (believe) in Trinity, and saying that the Messiah is God, are "Disbelievers" i.e. they disbelieve God.<br>  <br>  2-  Any time one commits Shirk, the whole work is nullified: Ref. 39:65<br>  <br>  39:65<br>  It has been revealed to you, and to those before you that if you ever commit idol worship, all your works will be nullified, and you will be with the losers.<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  <br>  So in my view (a Quranist), those Christians who fall into the above categories will FAIL.<br>  <br>  And we know that there are Christians (among Christians) who DO NOT believe in Trinity. NOR do they believe that Jesus is the begotten son of God. NOR do they believe that Jesus can save them.<br>  <br>  It is these Christians who will MOST ASSUREDLY SUCCEED. Ref. 2:62, 5:69.|`|hhQURRAoaa	how can islam say that christians cant go to heaven? the bible doesnt say muslims or jews or anyone wont go to heaven. as long as you are a good person it is up to god. islam is obviously a bogus religion.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	1.

The quote says specifically that those people CAN go to heaven if they 1) Believe in Allah and 2) Do right on the last day.  Believing in Allah means they must turn their backs on their own belief systems and instead become a Muslim, but they still must complete some form of good works, regardless.<br>  <br>  I used to worry about this.  The more I studied Islam and the more I studied Christianity, the more clear it became to me.  I love Jesus Christ and want to spend eternity with Him.  I'm afraid of Allah (who is not the same as God) and don't want to be around him.

Islamic people take lying about God very very seriously, from what I understand, and like I said before, that isn't a whole lot.

IFQFt25naa	There are many that say any group that practices spells/witchcraft/unusual rituals that call on any name other than Our Lord are actually serving the devil, regardless of what the group calls their God or in this case Goddess.<br>  <br>  Since Wicca is not really organized with a “formal/standard” set of rules that everyone must follow, there is often a great deal of diversity between the groups.  Some do lean more towards, what some might call devil worship, though your more tradition Wiccans will quickly condemn those practices and groups as non-wiccan.<br>  <br>  While I try my best to follow the teachings of Jesus, I have had dealings/worked with several of the groups, though we disagree on many things.   When dealing with the more passive and caring Wicca groups, I often find myself thinking about the story of the Good Samaritan which Jesus told.  Remembering, that at the time Samaritans, worshiped multiple gods practiced witch craft, etc. Yet Jesus placed the ACTIONS of the Samaritan in the story above the faith and practices of the Jews. <br>  <br>  With Wiccans, while they might not Follow Our Lord there are some that would do anything to help someone in need.  And doing what is right and helping others is the primary teaching of Jesus.  (a lot of people that claim to be christian could learn a thing or two from some of the Wiccans about how they should be living their life.)<br>  <br>  When it comes to Wicca, since each set/coven can be very different (some good, some not so good), I tend to look at the group based on what the group actually does, not what they say or others say they do. <br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Because it sounds like some kind of <br>  .<br>  Witch word<br>  .|`|AA11521494	All LHPs are misunderstood thanks to Christianity being the majority religion and its animosity to anything else - follow anything else and "it is of Satan" according to Christians.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	No , but I believe in Peanut Butter|`|an1b4pXxaa	Yes, sure.

G30RhfZiaa	1. The Gospel of John is attributed to John because it is the Gospel ACCORDING to John...John wrote it.<br>  <br>  2.There is NO Biblical evidence to support the claim that John was symbolised by an eagle. I do not know where she got this information. Challenge her on it.<br>  It could be because of his visions of the future as told in his book, Revelation, where he was given a bird's eye view of things.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	It was normal, in that time period, to allude to the writer of a work not by name but by an attribution. In this case, often where "The Beloved Disciple" is used, we know St. John the Beloved was in that position because of another Gospel. For example, the Gospel of St. Luke may say "Jesus and John went to the store" (that's not real scripture, obviously) and it will say the same in the other synoptics, but in the Gospel According To St. John it will say "Jesus and The Beloved Disciple went to the store".<br>  <br>  As to the second, St. John is the Eagle, I was told, because of his vast overview of Christ's life and message, and his deep knowledge and penetration of the Christian mystery. For example, his statement "In the beginning was The Word, and The Word was with God, and The Word was God" is a very important theological sentence, not found in the other Gospels. St. John flew over the world and faith, seeing more and understanding from a drastically different perspective.|`|Et011ogJaa	<a href="http://www.biblequizzes.com/art001.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblequizzes.com/art001.html</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps a little.|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	I have never heard of John as being symbolized by the Eagle, although I guess it would work.  Also, the reason we believe that the person who wrote John is the "One that Jesus loved..." is because that name is only mentioned in the book of John, and it is believed that he was a little bit stuck up and gave himself that title.|`|jOPUBmlJaa	<a href="http://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/pictures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/p...</a>|`|EAix5Av9aa	" Mount up as wings of eagles..."<br>   The ark of the Covenant was adorned by Cherubim and Seraphim in gold.

2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	The Peace Corps website has a list of requirements, and a little questionnaire you can fill out to see if you are qualified.  In general, you must be over the age of 18, and there is no limit on how old you can be.  You have to be a US citizen.  You have to have either at least a Bachelors Degree, or relevant work experience, skills and/or a community college degree.  Also, you must be cleared medically, financially (either pay off debt or make arrangements before you leave--student loans can be deferred, and part of Perkins loans can be forgiven for each year of completed service), and dentally.  Further, you must pass a background check--a criminal record will not automatically disqualify you, but it depends on what is in the record.  These are the only hard and fast requirements.  Other things that might affect your application--medical history/ongoing conditions, volunteer experience, knowledge of another language (helpful but not required), willingness to devote 27 months to service in another country, and flexibility.  Check out the Peace Corps website at www.peacecorps.gov and the "Am I Qualified" questionnaire at <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.howvol.qualify" rel="nofollow">http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shel...</a><br>  <br>  With my group, the average time from application to acceptance varied from 5 months to 20 months (longer timeframe for medical condition clearance).  Flexibility and patience are both really good virtues in this case.  Good luck!
BtpK297Yaa	Resident Evil is awesome!!:O<br>  Coffee is just delightful :)<br>  And hey... I have a boyfriend called Jimbo :D<br>  What a coincidence?:P
GaivlgXjaa	She seems to be scared out of her own mind...literally. Having sex, for her it seems, means being accepted by everybody. Not by her own body, no, but by everyone else. I was that way for a long time. I don't think there's much else to it, really.<br>  <br>  I think it's great that you're dating her and not pressuring her to do anything with you (right?). I would think this is a perfect opportunity for her to date a girl with you as a cover; I'm not sure what that leaves for you, but if she has to hide from her parents FOR NOW, then she has to. <br>  <br>  Judging by your level of speech you're at LEAST in college; so you both might still be in the generation that understands homophobia quite clearly. I'm sure that there are plenty of lesbians out there that would accept you as her 'cover-up date' until she can clear things up properly with mum and pop. You may be able to do the same thing--though probably not with another lady.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I think you bring up a good point here: "Wouldn't you assume sex would be bad if done with someone you don't fancy at all? That it would be awkward?".  I agree wholeheartedly.  All the time I hear bicurious folks talking about wanting to experiment, and I always caution against it and warn them.  Sex is emotional.  Even when it's between strangers in a casual exchange of lust, there is still a seed of attraction somewhere.  If you don't have that in terms of physical bodies, then you need to have it emotionally, if you want to "test" your sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I think what's to blame here is society, consistently pressuring us to believe that the penis is almighty, enough to "convert" lesbians.  And our whole culture tends to denigrate emotional connections in sex, focusing instead on the mechanics and the more racy aspects of it.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Obviously she's been under a lot of pressure to try to be straight. There are closeted gay people who spend there entire live married to people of the opposite gender.

She feels the need to reaffirm to herself (and others, apparently) that she doesn't like men.  There might be a part of her that doesn't want to be a lesbian, so she keeps at least trying out men, in the hopes of one day something clicking that she enjoys.  I seriously doubt that day is every going to come from the sound of it.

This date was chosen perhaps in keeping with the holidays already indoctrinated into pagans.<br>  <br>  Roman pagans celebrated Dec. 25th as the birth of their ‘god’ of light, Mithra. “In the 2nd century A..D., it (Mithraism) was more general in the Roman Empire than Christianity, to which it bore many similarities” (The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia, 1995 ed). “The reason why Christmas came to be celebrated on December 25 remains uncertain, but most probably the reason is that early Christians wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival marking the “birthday of the unconquered sun” (natalis solis invicti); this festival celebrated the winter solstice, when the days again begin to lengthen and the sun begins to climb higher in the sky”. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 1998 Ed.) Other pagan ‘gods’ born on Dec. 25th are: Hercules, the son of Zeus (Greeks) Bacchus, god of wind, (Romans),Adenis god of Greeks Freyr the Greek-Roman god<br>  <br>  The “Santa” Character was further developed in 1809 when an amusing but inaccurate history of Dutch traditions was written. Washington Irving, influenced by north European Christmas customs, pictured St. Nicholas riding in a wagon merrily over rooftops, dropping presents down chimneys, the first time this had been sighted, the word ‘Santa Claus’ appears no where in the bible. However Saint Nicholas (Santa Claus) was a real person, bishop, who was born 300 years after Jesus (pbuh). According to legend he was extremely kind and went out at night to distribute presents to the needy.<br>  <br>  Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.[4:48]<br>  <br>  Christian belief states that the one God reveals himself in the three persons of Father, Son (Jesus Christ) and Holy Spirit. These three persons are nevertheless regarded as a unity, sharing one ’substance’. Prophet Jesus is elevated to divinity, sits on the right hand of God and judges the world. The Holy Spirit, who in the Hebrew Bible is the means by which God exercises his creative power, in Christian thought becomes a part of the God-head. Paul made the Holy Spirit the alter ego of Christ, the guide and help of Christians, first manifesting itself on the day of Pentecost. Consequently, Shirk in Ruboobeeyah occurs in the Christian belief that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are God’s partners in all of His dominion, in their belief that Jesus alone pronounces judgment on the world and in their belief that Christians are helped and guided by the Holy Spirit. This form of Shirk occurs when any act of worship is directed to other than Allah.<br>  <br>  Indeed they do blaspheme those who say that Allah is Jesus, the son of Mary, but Jesus said “O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord”. Whoever joins other gods with Allah, Allah will forbid him heaven and the fire will be his abode. (5:72)<br>  <br>  ‘Abdull?￠h ibn Mas’??d (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that All?￠h’s Messenger (pbuh) said, “Anyone who dies worshipping others along with All?￠h will definitely enter the Fire.” I said, “Anyone who dies worshipping none along with All?￠h will definitely enter Paradise.” (Bukh?￠ri and Muslim )<br>  <br>  yea thats right. u noe what im sayin cool thats right.|`|hhQURRAoaa	ramadan?|`|sDdp3RBpaa	UR A GIRL|`|CPoCGREPaa	Gosh, I HATE hidden users!

G30RhfZiaa	Sex is a beautiful thing created by God to be enjoyed between man and his wife.<br>  <br>  Alcohol - anything in moderation is fine. Anything in access and you pay the price - yr health, yr life, etc.<br>  <br>  You don't need Christianity to tell you these things. Use yr common sense.<br>  <br>  As for Christianity, it is NOT a religion but a personal relationship with God. This is truly a wonderful experience.|`|7cBOKehWaa	I assume you mean Christianity.|`|iblT1HJpaa	I would assume you are Muslim? <br>  Good question. <br>  Hard to answer in a paragraph and considering there are thousands of books on the subject, I would say that it can't be answered or people would have stopped their writing. <br>  Christianity is a belief in a God that has three parts - (Trinity), God the Father, God the Son [Jesus Christ] and God the Holy Spirit [Spirit of God]. Sex is to be confined within the sanctity of the marriage covenant (which almost no one does) and alcohol is to be consumed "in moderation". (Which most do and many can't) If it wasn't for alcohol (disinfectant) humans would have probably died out a long time ago. <br>  Like all religions - it is filled with rules and regulations which are mostly crap, but one has to dig deep into the Bible (God's Word) to ascertain for themselves what is truly right and what is wrong. God has set that in our hearts and minds (Moral Law) already - and you have free-will to choose your own course. <br>  Will you choose good or will you choose evil?|`|JXnyZ8rIaa	Sex in the Christian faith is strictly for procreation or the sharing of love between a man and wife.  Depending on the brand of Christian, alcohol rules go from "in moderation" to never at all.  This means outlawing sex outside of marriage and homosexuality.  It is all silliness in my book, basing your life on arbitrary rules written thousands of years ago by men claiming to speak for a deity who isn't there.|`|AA11502346	It would take me forever to describe every detail about my Christian faith.  The Ten Commandments is considered to be a set of rules and regulations of our faith.<br>  <br>  As far as sex is concerned, only sex between a heterosexual married couple is allowed.  Alcohol consumption is okay as long as it does not lead to drunkeness.<br>  <br>  The main point of Christianity is Jesus Christ.  Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind and rose from the dead 3 days later.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	"Bible .org" is a great site about the Christian religion, <br>   but the articles are a lot of reading.

Secondly, according to the bible, sex was designed for having babies. <br>  <br>  Generally, though, most churches have adopted much more inclusive rules about sex and alcohol.  <br>  <br>  So my point is that, sometimes, man makes religions that are different from the bible because they like to control.  However, the first Commandment says it all, "Thou shalt have no other god before me.."<br>  <br>  Therefore, if sex or alcohol or the internet or work or chocolate or anything else is more important to you than God, then you are breaking the first commandment.|`|a12162a4de146505074aad130a63826daa	The first thing you need to do is to get a Bible (there are several versions) and read it extensively. Join a local Bible based Church which has Bible study classes and ask them your questions. <br>  Rules would probably be covered in the Ten commandments. The main rule in Christianity is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and to love your neighbor as yourself.<br>  Alcohol consumption is not encouraged as it causes one to err (read the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament of the Bible).<br>  Sex is created by God to be enjoyed between husband and wife within the confines of marriage and subject to the mutual consent of both of them for enjoyment , fulfillment , intimacy and for the purpose of pro-creation.|`|OWpeAy2Taa	Gospel of Mark 16:17-18….”Every Christian has to drink deadly poison, those who survive are true Christians”<br>  <br>  How many of them have undergone this test…if not it means either they don’t believe their holy book or they are not true Christian and they r sure that u wont survive……<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  “Ye shall not add unto the word which I (God) command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.” (Deuteronomy 4:2)<br>  <br>  <br>  Every year a new bible<br>  <br>  <br>  Once, when Jesus sent his disciples out, he advised them, "Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans.

With this all your sins with be forgiven" If you drink the blood and eat the body your sins will be forgiven.

When he came back, he had even learned a lot from Buddhism (believe it or not).<br>  Thus, he attempted to teach the people how to become spiritual and less materialistic.  <br>  A lot of his teachings have been drastically changed or falsely translated.  A good example of a false translation is how they now call Jesus the son of God; that's because Jesus said I am a son of God as we're all children of God.  He simply meant that he is no different than us!<br>  I consider myself a Christian and I believe that Jesus was a very good man and he literally gave his life to send his message to everyone!  It worked, if you simply read his teachings *only*, you'll see what I'm talking about!<br>  Take care!

Christians believe that they go to heaven after they die, so (especially if the deceased person was older) the service may be more of a celebration of their life and the fact that they are in a better place now.  <br>  <br>  If they're Catholic, then it will probably be a traditional mass.  If you're not familiar with the way a Catholic service goes, find someone to sit with who does, or at least be very alert - there is a lot of ritualistic sitting/standing/reciting things/responses to things the priest says.<br>  <br>  If they serve communion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist)," rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist),</a> the best way to avoid calling attention to yourself is probably not to participate.  Just be respectful to the church, the deceased, and his/her family; most people will have a million things on their minds that are more important than judging you for not bowing your head the right way (or other trivial things).  The point is that you are there to honour someone's life and to comfort the people who were important to him/her.|`|AA11502346	They pray for the family of the deceased and the pastor of the service talks about the deceased individual.  <br>  <br>  Most likely, they will play "Amazing Grace" during the service.  My dad used to love hearing this song until it got overplayed at the funerals he attended.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	As I know about Catholics, we have testimonies about the deceased persons life from friends and relatives, and everybody laughs and cries, and then we commit the body to the ground, and have a feast and get drunk and go home.<br>  Well thats what Ive experienced though its not the Catholic norm.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Hmm.I'm not a christan.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	"Brothers [and sisters], we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope...For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage each other with these words."|`|zQyslfHKaa	Convinced each other that, not only was One Eyed Jack the Rapist a stellar guy, but that he is likely singing in the choir eternal as they pray.<br>  <br>  Its hilarious how incredibly mean people, suddenly become heaven worthy after they die.|`|gKwKxJyNaa	Pretty much "he is in God's arms now" "he is watching over us from Heaven" and then a lot of prayers...and then just your average funeral, memories, crying, crying, shaking of heads when they say how good they were as a person.....|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	you can cry if you feel like crying. If not, then all you have to do is stand around, appear subdued, don't wear bright-colored clothes, and pray for the dead's soul.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Just sit and watch.

Then they sing. Sometimes they have the final viewing in which you walk back up to the casket and say your good byes etc. A lot of crying goes on in most cases but really this is normal but some people take it to the extreme. If you are not use to a christian burial then it may freak you out a bit because they dress their dead up in clothes, put makeup on them and do their hair. Also they put fluid inside of their arteries to keep them from decaying since the funerals often take place a week or more after the person has died and this fluid that they put inside of them(formaldehyde) makes them look like plastic and scary if you ask me.|`|fKFPiTEiaa	They have viewings/visitations a day or so before the funeral, Some of them cry, some of them go, "That one's in a better place, now," the weird freak in the corner will try to cry. The weird freak in the corner might also comfort/hug with that ever familiar staunch look on her face, If it's her best friend's grandma's type of funeral. The not so weird or freaky might hug and cry or need a hug. Hope you don't mind being in physical contact with someone you probably consider an infidel... They sing some hymns about Heaven, and the chosen Pastor delivers a message, reminiscence, or eulogy about the life of the deceased. The weird freak may howl or chant (in pack-ese, the language of family that are not kin by blood) if it's any of her best friends' funerals, especially the life saving 66 year old. Or she just may pretend or try to cry, and/or ask Lord God to take care of friend, and "Make sure they have fun up there." Don't worry, you'll be prompted by the eulogy giver on what you should do. They'll stand and sit around, cry, maybe rise for hymns, prayer or Bible reading. :) Don't worry. You'll do fine. :)<br>  <br>  PS. You should do just fine with tradition. I wouldn't worry about being offensive, because we're generally rather laid back. Hey, I'm a wierd freak; I manage to survive.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	my husband was a pastor and he passed away last year.  im not sure exactly what you want to know.. usually there is the calling hours, which is just to chat with other people and view the body.  then there is the funeral service, usually held in a church or funeral home, that consists of prayers, passages from the Bible, and sometimes eulogies about the deceased.  then usually everyone gets in their cars and follows the hearse to the gravesite where there are a few more words said, another prayers, and then everyone leaves for the reception (in my husband's case we had a party, because that is what he wanted).  there is food/snacks there, and people usually catch up and talk some more.. nothing extraordinarily religious happens, other than prayers and some passages... most funerals are similar to this.  sorry for your loss.  good luck!|`|0YQRbq9faa	We cry and grieve our loss. We hear some supportive, encouraging words from the Pastor about life and death and the person that passed away.  We pray.  We sing.  We say our final goodbyes.  Then we meet at the grave site for the committal (lowering the casket into the ground) and burial of the loved one.<br>  <br>  I have been to and performed many funerals.  When it is a believer that died, there is sadness but there is also hope and joy as we know that the person is with God and that we will see them again someday in Heaven.  Death does not end your life, it ends your physical life on earth; but it relocates you spiritually either to Heaven or hell.|`|2KRiVfKAaa	Mourn.

F0Uykc4saa	Get on with it!  You said the box is not yours - so be it.  Stop troubling yourself over something that at the end of the day has absolutely nothing to do with anything.  Tell your neighbor to pull his head in and if it troubles him that much then shift the bloody thing. It's not yours and you're not interested - but thanks for your concern and all.  <br>  <br>  That's one angle - another is to just put it in the rubbish and be done with it.  One way or another you can put it behind you and get on with other stuff.|`|q6H2ru3waa	It sounds like no one is responsible if there is no name or return address on the box.|`|AA11992885	sadly, by touching it, you assumed responsibility for it|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I would look inside it first and make sure there is nothing of value in there and just throw it away. Your neighbor shouldn't have been so assuming about the box but just throw it away otherwise it will sit there forever. And even if he does see you throw it away who really cares what he thinks. You know it's not yours and that's all that matters.|`|y1CRemnPaa	you let a box just sit there for three weeks without knowing what it was?<br>  <br>  what if it was a baby or a timebomb or anthrax?|`|XzXpDPpfaa	Open it.

I understand where you are coming from.  Growing up, I was brought up wtih two completely different religions....Judaism and Catholicism...My grandma was a hardcore catholic telling me I need to accept Jesus in my life or I will be doomed to HELL!  But on the other hand my mom was telling me we just don't beleive in all of that...Who the heck was I supposed to beleive?!  It's so ignorant to try to force somebody to beleive what YOU beleive just because that's what YOU were told growing up.  It doesn't make sense that I am brought up being told to beleive in two different things.  What do I choose?  I want my mom and my grandma to be right...but according to them...they both just contridict eachother.  I don't beleive in any of that.  I think it is great to have a beleif system.  Of course there is something or someone out there that has created us...but just because you were born into a certain organized religion that somebody decided to make up thousands of years ago to gain power over people...doesn't make that particular group of people better or more right than another.  As long as we all are kind and compassionate towards eachother...then we will live with happiness.  Making up something like hell is just for the weakminded.  There is no proof whatsoever...Who ever thought of something like that is someone who fears the unknown.  Just because you have fear and doubts in your life doesn't make it okay to bring it into someone elses.  I think everybody should have the thought in mind that we are all equal and nobody is better than anybody else...just because they are born to a certain family or place....WE ARE EQUAL...I wish people would get that through your head.  Ignorance is bliss...that is for damn sure.|`|060c440e61fd2c2514b61e87b02c02c2aa	I'll pray for you!|`|AA10010119	not long !!!!!<br>  based on your type !|`|AA12366582	If you HATE God and Jesus so much, then why are you on the spiritual and religious site?

A mí particularmente me encantan los modismos y expresiones regionales de cualquier parte, pero mis favoritas son las de Venezuela, Perú y Espa?a, y dentro de mi país la variante que más me gusta es la de la zona baja oriental, aunque yo soy de la zona alta occidental.<br>  <br>  Saludos desde La Paz, Bolivia.|`|f08b99704a794f45d696147ceea55a0daa	A mí me parece que no se puede decir que uno sea mejor que otro. Los idiomas tienen vida propia y se desarrollan de forma distinta dependiendo del lugar en que son hablados. No creo que podamos decir que un idioma se habla peor en un país determinado porque haya evolucionado de forma distinta a como lo ha hecho en su lugar de origen. La RAE recoge muchas formas que son propias solo de América latina, pero también recoge formas propias de distintas comunidades autónomas espa?olas. Sería como preguntar si es mejor espa?ol el que se habla en Madrid o el que se habla en León.<br>  Yo no he vivido en América latina, pero en Alemania conocí a un chico de Canarias al que otros espa?oles le andaban siempre corrigiendo y él decía que el lenguaje también es democrático y que la forma en que él hablaba era la usada por mayor número de hispanohablantes (Canarias, Andalucía y América latina) y, por tanto, era la más correcta. Es otra forma de verlo. No es que esté de acuerdo, lo pongo solo porque me hacía mucha gracia este razonamiento.|`|wSSyNWtBaa	Esa pregunta se responde sola.

We pray for others, and our needs are met by Jesus.  He answers Prayers in His time, not ours. Our job is to believe with all our hearts that He will answer it.  <br>  When you ask a prayer, and don't receive what you ask, it is because He doesn't think you need it. <br>  As for God being too busy to answer prayers; He is never too busy!<br>  An example; I gave my life to Jesus Christ fifteen years ago. Since then, I have had many prayers answered that pertained to the healing of my children (one at a time). They were healed. I have also ask for things that seem important to me at the time, and I never received an answer from God.

(I Corinthians 6:3). <br>          Yes, those who are resurrected in the first resurrection (Revelation 20:5) are to share RULERSHIP OF THE WORLD with Christ for the first one thousand years (Revelation 2:26, Revelation 20:4), and are to be like "pillars in the temple of God" (Revelation 3:12) living, ruling, reigning with God the Father and with Jesus Christ His Son FOR ALL ETERNITY! <br>          God says the time will come-after the millennium-AFTER the great judgment of the "rest of the dead" (Revelation 20:5, 11:15) that He, God the Father, will come down to THIS EARTH-and ".... the throne of God and of the Lamb [Christ] shall be in it..."

The churches don't teach it! But you have SEEN, with your own eyes, in your own Bible, the real truth about YOUR personal DESTINY! <br>          May God help you to surrender your will to HIM; to repent; to be baptized; to receive His Spirit-to become HIS CHILD-to finally be BORN into His great Spirit FAMILY.

362b704565dd41499f57bdbff2176c8caa	I'm not sure what you mean by your question. I'll answer though after I reword your question to what I think it means. Hopefully it will be similar to what you asked.<br>  <br>  What is the significance of rain? Why does it happen?<br>  From what I gather in the Bible, God used to water the plants by bringing the water up from the ground (Genesis 2:5). Even the soil was different then, becasue clay soil was a curse for man so that he would find it harder to grow things from the ground (Genesis 3:17).<br>  <br>  The rain began at the time of the flood (Genesis 7:4). Rain can be a reminder that things are not quite as they were, and the time of the Earth is limited.<br>  <br>  "What is the meaning of now what is going on in these bloody places?!?!"<br>  If you mean the events currently unfolding, the stage is being set for the End. The End is still a long way off, but the event of the Rapture is coming quickly.<br>  <br>  Many call this Gloom and Doom. To that I say, NOT! We are approaching the end of sin on Earth! That's not gloom and doom unless you like the world, and you like sin. That is, you want to keep sin around as long as possible.<br>  <br>  Jesus is going to take His church out of the way soon.

WE HAVE FREE WILL. This means GOD is waiting, watching, I kind of think hoping that we humans grow faster to understand what Jesus told us, and live like HE hopes. OUR FREE WILL is the cause for all our troubles - but also the cause of humans greatness. People have the free will to be better, and many choose to. May I suggest that you stop watching or reading the world news and stay involved in the smaller local communities.

Try to be exactly like him. His life was an open book for us, a guide for our life, and a solution to all our problems. Learn from him how did he treated his family, how did he eat, how did he used to joke with his companions, how he used to tackle daily-problems, and most importantly how did he pray to God and used this absolute confidence in his belief to deliver him to happiness by continuously giving people rather than taking from them!<br>  <br>  Read the Quran for " the Prophet's morals were the Quran"

Si estoy en el trabajo, y surge algún inconveniente, tratar de resolverlo en el momento, y si no se puede,  una vez que dejo el sitio, guardar esos pensamientos hasta el día siguiente.

AA12095698	This is a bullying issue...you should go to the administration and discuss this with your counselor at school. Those people are ignorant and need to be educated. I know you have enough to deal with health issue wise, but be brave and courageous and bring this matter to light so others don't suffer like you are...you can make a difference by doing this and YOU will be a hero for it!

Anyone who makes fun of you is a real jerk, anyone who goes along with them is either a follower or more scared then you are of not being accepted. You have a real social limitation and you still have the strength of character to not sink to that low. You are not going to sell out others to make friends. It is tempting to be liked by everyone, we all want to be accepted and liked, but its true friendship and family that matter. Real respect. I don't know you but I respect your choice to not make fun of other in weakness. I am sure you have other things that make you a strong person too. <br>  These are the kinds of friends you will attract to you. These other people have issues they need to work out. Its hard but remember, they are more afraid of you, than you are of them. Be yourself and ignore those your age who are not mature enough to look past appearances. Hope they get over it and move on. Life is a story, and each of us has hurdles, this is yours. Focus on the things in your life that are good, on your dreams!

AA12074162	Very approachable, friendly and sociable but inside a loner and quite sensitive. Tend to hide my feelings behind a smile. I'm a people pleaser which I don't like all the time. Caring and compassionate, always on the side of the liitle guy. Extreme in all things but never to an extreme (if that makes sense). Bit eccentric but calming down as I get older. Have good intuition and am intellectually orientated. Can be quite ascetic but will then throw myself into a hedonistic period of parties and overindulgence. Scared of intimacy and not sure I want another relationship. Take life seriously - but have a sense of humour. I love nature and hi tech inventions equally - so long as they don't clash.<br>  <br>  I practice meditation and know that for me it reduces stress - have never been so relaxed and at peace with myself.|`|e3811e043d831f6e68bbb6936044d77eaa	I have an outgoing personality. I do manage stress very well. I figured out how not to sweat the small stuff and major issues will be better resolved if you do not get all worked up over them. You can;t make anything better by stressing over them. So why bother I take it one day at a time and I really don't let anything bother me. Things will work out the way they should and stressing will not change the out come at all.|`|e6b6aa94e4c84a1c6176e6dbd771a589aa	I usually manage my stress level by going out for a walk and buying something which pleases me not expensive though, but little stuff like new song's CD or pick up some new stationary accessories from Staples Depot etc. Or renting a good horror or thriller movies or at worse renting a good porno movie and enjoy watching it on my own.

Also find some pine cones and spray them a metallic color, that also looks gorgeous. what I have also seen on other trees but haven't tried it myself is putting a huge bow made of ribbon to top the tree and have extra ribbon fall to the sides like a volcano shooting lava, looks really nice if you find ribbon that matches your colors.

43985e79db8caf82972ebed45400b96baa	No sé la explicación a nivel neurológico, pero me acuerdo que cuando estudié para maestra nos ense?aron algo que me impactó mucho, porque lo considero muy real. Un pedagogo (no recuerdo cuál), habló de "HUELLAS COGNITIVAS". Estas son las que nos sirven para aprender algo. Entiéndase que hablo de aprender, no de memorizar. Cuando uno aprende de verdad algo, le queda para toda la vida. Las huellas cognitivas son aquellas cosas que ya sabemos y que nos sirven para que lo nuevo se relacione con ellas y termine siendo una nueva huella cognitiva. Forman algo así como una enorme red. Es mi opinión (no quiere decir que sea tal cual), que con los olores ocurre algo semejante. Relacionamos los olores con algo que es significativo para nosotros, de forma tal que pasa a formar parte para siempre de nuestros recuerdos.<br>  La verdad es que leer tu mail me dio un poco de nostalgia, porque cuando leí lo de los recuerdos de los olores, no pude evitar recordar el olor del rocío en la tierra y el pasto de mi Bs. As. querido ???Buaaaaaaaaaa!!! Te aseguro que pese a la polución y todo, es un olor que se siente puro y es riquísimo. ???Quiero ir a pasear a Argentinaaaaaaaaaaa!!!|`|1b220acb48007ad5e8085164858d7482aa	simplemente porque nuestros cerebros están dise?ados para ello|`|24c216d416581da8ab5f876a37a993f9aa	No se que es lo que funciona en el cerebro, pero es como vos decís es algo muy lindo e inexplicable, te hace viajar a lugares por donde vos anduviste y te hace recordar eso y muchas cosas mas, seguro va acompa?ado del recuerdo de los sabores porque también uno recuerda eso.<br>  Que linda tu pregunta!!!hay olores que recuerdo de lugares que hace unos 15 a?os visite cuando estaba embarcado, son lugares tan distantes que siempre recuerdo tanto por las imágenes que me quedaron grabadas y también por ciertos olores lindos que no se borran de mi mente.<br>  <br>   un besote|`|3a94cd345cb3e9588460a5203282dfb4aa	Se llama memoria olfativa, se supone que cada uno de nuestros sentidos esta ligado a esa parte del cerebro que guarda los recuerdos, de ese modo ciertos olores nos transportaran a epocas o personas que probablemente ya no estan o nos haran recordar algun hecho agradable o desagradable, lo mismo sucede con la musica, con el clima, hasta con los sue?os!|`|9098204bb4cc38480686c9f7c02316dcaa	me gustaria seberlo|`|0a150ded4d05b420ec3e9cc0a95555beaa	Ese olor la mente lo almacena y relaciona con un evento/persona en particular, son memorias, asi como cuando ves un lugar recuerdas algo. es lo mismo con los olores y sensaciones|`|0bc9428fc74574ce1db8c37667f52439aa	porq estan en la parte de la memoria sensitiva, uno puede traerlos al conciente en cualquier momento|`|46784c7e278bd71ba988a5617db9b8e0aa	Por suerte podemos, ya que imagínate que se nos olvidara por ejemplo el olor del gas doméstico, sería muy peligroso.SALUDOS|`|9446bc63177a155ee6ae4e75e2147f06aa	Podemos recordar cosas intangibles gracias a nuestras celulas neurables.<br>  El olfato, la vista, el tacto, el oído y el gusto son "sentidos" que están conectados a células neurales que van directamente hacia el cerebro. Estas células son células de "memoria". Por lo tanto se guardan como datos en nuestro cerebro. De esa manera podemos olvidar lo que estudiamos ayer, pero recordar una situación X que vivimos hace a?os, si alfún estímulo hace que ese sector del cerebro se active. Ese estímulo puede ser doloroso, visual, olfatorio, de sonidos...<br>  Por eso recordamos no solo olores, sino situaciones.<br>  Astarté|`|c588d3c710a90c7f2a0649176ede039aaa	Esta es una breve explicación, a nivel físico, del porqué :<br>  El sentido del olfato es el más complejo y sensible de todos.<br>  Todo olor penetra por la nariz, y sube hacia los receptores olfativos, que es dónde se origina el olfato. Los nervios olfativos son las únicas vías sensoriales que llegan directamente al cerebro.<br>  Una vez que se identifica el olor, las células, transmiten esa información al sistema límbico del cerebro (el más profundo y el que se relaciona (entre otras cosas) con las emociones), pudiendo desencadenar recuerdos de manera automática (no racionalizado).<br>  Es como si cada olor fuera como una "llave" que abre un recuerdo directamente, cosa que no pasa con la vista u el oido (en general tenemos que pensar "donde" lo vimos o lo oímos)<br>  Como el sitema límbico también actúa regulando el sistema endócrino, un olor tiene la capacidad de desatar las hormonas que regulan el apetito (cuando olemos algo rico), los niveles de stress, el instinto sexual y los pensamientos y las reacciones conscientes.<br>  Espero no haber sido demasiado técnica!!|`|f42b972f9c0125591981142fd8d267c2aa	El sentido del olfato es lo más animal, lo más primitivo que tenemos y que, curiosamente no pueden duplicar en los robots, ni ese, ni el gusto.<br>  <br>  Es un sentido con el que más bien reaccionas, te causa coraje, miedo, ilusión, amor, ternura, seguridad.... etc. etc., según con qué lo relacione tu cerebro, qué imágenes o sensaciones puedan estar asociadas con él.<br>  <br>  De eso se valen, entre otras cosas, los anuncios de sopas, "como estar en casa", o enjuagues, sólo por poner ejemplos, que se siente la seguridad de estar con mamá, etc.<br>  <br>  No todos están conscientes de recordar los olores, aunque así sea.<br>  <br>  R|`|meqeSroPaa	porque el cerebro asimila la informacio directa atraves de los cinco sentidos y practicamente el olfato esta envuelto en la mayoria de las cosas, me refiero a un maor porcentaje que los otros, normalmente aquellas sensaciones que nos agradan o que odiamos el cerebro trata de recordarlas como un sistema de alerta|`|o1LvSs77aa	No sé la explicación técnica, pero finalmente el olfato es un sentido como la vista, y el oído...de hecho se me hace más curioso el poder recordar la sensación de una textura sobre la piel...<br>  <br>  Volviendo a los olores yo quisiera saber, por qué a veces los percibimos en un sue?o...|`|c76e7e7581181d2851f6f768b73523a3aa	los olores no se recuerdan , disparan algun recuerdo , pero el olor no lo puedes rocordar|`|e7ba85db60809c80314e31591e72622aaa	No sé pero yo por ejemplo lo que tengo es memoria musical. Depende de cómo uno fue criado. Cuando era chica no había tele y escuchábamos mucha música y mis recuerdos afloran con las distintas canciones de cualquier tipo las que me traen los recuerdos e imágenes de esos momentos y mi papá me dice que eso se llama MEMORIA MUSICAL. Yo creo que el cerebro es una máquina perfecta, para todas las cosas, las buenas y las malas, y selecciona cuales están intáctas y cuales no. A mi me pasa que tengo vacíos de ciertas cosas y por más que intento no recuerdo, pero otras están a flor de piel.

Cualquiera tiene la capacidad de serlo, sea reconocido después de su muerte o no; todos tuvieron errores, pero por eso existen el arrepentimiento y perdón. <br>  En cuanto al sexo...es un tema que requiere de una larga explicación...|`|00c9822e39acebe3693acccb05ad82fcaa	Desafortunadamente la igelsia catolica sataniso el regalo más lindo que le hizo DIOS al hombre. Y para ellos preferiblemente un santo debe ser célibe sin embargo sanJuan y los apostoles no practicaban el célibato pues cunado conocieron a Jesús  ya habian tenido amorios con mujeres.|`|18ad4cd7d1c04da44f40f557039b64d0aa	No se requiere ser celibe para ser santo. Lo que se requiere es que seas "ejemplo de vida". Hay santos que eran casados.|`|390a1f69402e3f01e7185adf6b8a354faa	Te responderé cuando me explique alguien qué es la santidad y en qué consiste.|`|8c0a2a791425242c402487eb08c051deaa	según la la iglesia y la biblia para ser santo, prácticamente no hay que ir al ba?o porque es pecado.Los sacerdotes no pueden tener ningún tipo de relación sexual....eso deja mucho que pensar, pero si hay algún tipo de escandalo como la que se dio en muchas partes entre "enviados de Dios" y chicos abusados la iglesia se encarga de ocultarlos muy bien.<br>  segun ellos el sexo no es sexo sino hacer el amor,ES REALMENTE LO MISMO!!!!|`|95e69fcfc5fa6a37bdddea60a632829daa	Para los católicos Sexo es un regalo de Dios .<br>  Por eso lo apreciamos y cuidamos .<br>  Existen santos célibes y otros no.<br>  No es requisito .<br>  Si es respetarte y respetar a los demás.|`|a323ef8d344959ea9d9d264c65e654a4aa	Con razón Cristo no es santo. pues no era célibe. vieron que no existe un San jesus o un San cristo ?<br>  Dios invento los sexos, "mujer y hombre los creo...." dice la biblia, y alguna razon habrá tenido, los hombres (?) inventaron eso el celibato. es cuestion de elegir..<br>  Recordad aquí las palabras del master: "Elegid hoy a quien servireis"<br>  Mejor es seguir a Cristo brothers mios, y no a la iglesia o religion alguna.|`|a585a95794c744bf5fbc0ad0c60a5714aa	No, hay muchos santos que fueron casados y que tuvieron una flia normal. Todos estamos llamados a ser santos. El sexo no es pecado, el sexo sin responsabilidad ni fidelidad ese si es pecado. Espero poderte ayudar con mi respuesta. suerte!!|`|d81ae76614e188ba948d492d99552663aa	No la religion dice que el sexo es hermoso dentro del matrimonio; porque lo creo Dios, ademas hay hombres casados que fueron santos como el papa de Sta. Teresita de Lissiure y San Isidro que resucito a una nina que murio ahogada primero, fue casado.  Los apostoles fueron casados a ecepcion de Pablo y fueron santos.|`|255fa9513758ba4923d5783af08c165faa	Pero la Iglesia esta en contra de los metodos anticonceptivos!!!<br>  O sea... ponela solo cuando quieras tener un hijo...<br>  Pero no entiendo porque para ser cura esta eso del celibato, no dijo Dios: "crecer y multiplicaos"?????<br>  <br>  Salute!|`|374186cdce5102f7380291151adbdaf3aa	eso, o que tengas muy buenos contactos en el Vaticano|`|4e4d5b1a196609f27e8dc9cbc76d2183aa	ke horror... <br>  por eso tengo mi dios personal.<br>  <br>  Esos catolicos estaran todos en el infierno cuando se mueran de tanto sexo.. <br>  jajajajaja|`|8e37bfcde34904e7c4238d5ab69483a4aa	Nooo , nada que ver , se nota que no vas a la Iglesia muy seguido , y que tampoco dedicas tiempo a leer la Biblia porque seguro tienes cosas MAS " IMPORTANTES" que hacer, bueno , el sexo no es pecado , lo que se opone la Iglesia es al sexo libre y lujurioso cuyo único afan es satsfacer las necesidades , ése es el que se considera pecado , puesto que Dios creó el sexo para que lo disfrutemos , pero nosotros tenemos que hacer el amor con nuestras parejas , pero tenemos que amar a la persona con quien practicamos el sexo , porque allí el sexo trasciende lo físico y se eleva al grado espiritual , te recomiendo que para que entiendas la visión que tenemos los católicos del sexo leas el libro Cantar de los Cantares, de la Biblia...Infòrmate un poco más?|`|ns5G2u9iaa	No tiene nada que ver una cosa con la otra. Muchas de las personas que son santos o que son martir son personas con familias que tiene hijos, no deben de confundir eso|`|03e097e2af671c83e125a6234f288fadaa	Y ... ?para que queremos ser santos?|`|862481d6cac0fc901c8bb4569cdcd4feaa	Tú debes ser otro de esos tantos que se cree las mentiras de los "pastores" para atacar al catolicismo ?verdad?<br>  <br>  Investiga un poco y te darás cuenta de lo equivocado que estás.<br>  <br>  El catolicismo no dice que el sexo sea basura; todo lo contrario: es hermoso en su contexto correcto.

Depende de nosotros el cambio real y profundo. Empecemos cada uno, en el diario vivir cambiando algunas actitudes, cambiando nuestra forma de hablar, tratando de no discriminar. Cada generación es la responsable de reproducir los mismos valores heredados por sus ancestros, de revisarlos y de modificarlos. Si seguimos repitiendo los viejos dogmas, entonces estaremos por siempre atrapados en el pasado. <br>  Hay que mirarnos al espejo y sincerarnos, ?Estamos realmente trabajando para el cambio, o nos es más cómodo seguir al reba?o y dejarnos fluir según la corriente?|`|6gUpImi6aa	creo que la única razón es porque las mujeres les ense?amos eso a ellos. las mamás regularmente nos hacemos cargo de los hijos y de alguna forma nosotros se los ense?amos, además si tu vecina tiene un amante no dices que lista, inmediatamente dices es una p....<br>  comprendes??????????????????|`|7fd3a6e5ab223d1c4c476f7cec0334bbaa	porque es muy dificil intentar cambiar sus pocas neuronas en tan poco tiempo... porque piensas que emos tardado tanto en evolucionar???<br>  <br>  Y TE APOLLO!!!!  <br>  <br>  ABAJO LOS HOMBRES RETROGRADOS Y MACHISTAS QUE SE RETUERSEN CUANDO LA MUJER LOS SUPERA!!!!|`|AB14fyMIaa	Creo que existen diversos factores que influyen a la generación del machismo, entre otras cosas te podría decir que tienes toda la razón y creo que es injusto, pero también creo que es porque desde siempre lo hemos permitido, o porque nuestros antepasados generación con generación se fue educando a los hombres así. Si te fijas además del ejemplo que presentas también es demasiado notorio en celebridades de anta?o, filósofos, artistas, los guerrilleros, presidentes, dioses, y gente importante de todo el mundo y desde siempre han sido hombres las mujeres hemos tenido papeles importantes claro! pero son mas resaltados en los hombres ?A que se  devera? ?Ellos son los que siempre toman la iniciativa y por eso se nos adelantan? No lo se, pero en estos tiempos las damas nos estamos levantando en muchos ámbitos sociales, culturales, profesionales, etc. y lo que falta, de manera  que esto del machismo tal vez no se exterminara por completo pero creo que por lo menos conseguiremos la igualdad y eso si es una gran ventajas que nos hemos ganado a pulso.|`|aidUP3JYaa	porke los pinchez hombres son unos llorones ke no se aguantan de ke les partan la madre a su diske hombria, por eso nos llaman de las peores formas ke saben porke no pueden sobrellevar el que les pongan los cuernos. a la mayoria, desde ke nacen les inculcan ke ellos por ser hombres pueden andar de putos pues es una necesidad nata de ellos, pero ke las mujeres nos debemos de hacer de la vista gorda y perdonarlos o simplemente dejarlos ser! y ellos son incapaces de creer ke nosostras les podemos hacer lo mismo para darles en la madre, y por creer esas idioteces! por eso no progresamos con hombres asi.|`|e1e0f7627f7d268dd861a11582f9d65aaa	La mujer nunca va a superar al hombre...

Esto habrìa sido inaceptable para los judìos, que se creìan una raza superior a las demàs. Pero con la historia de Ruth Dios dejò el mensaje de que todos los que desean vivir una vida digna de El, son parte de su pueblo. No hay "mèritos" por factores externos.

Corrígeme si estoy equivocado:<br>  <br>  "Hacia doce a?os que Nabucodonosor, rey de Asiria, reinaba en la gran ciudad de Nínive" (Judit 1:1)<br>  <br>  Es cierto, es un error histórico. Nabucodonosor era rey de Babilonia y no de Asiria. Fallas de este tipo son los que hacen que los protestantes veamos en los libros apócrifos/deuterocanonicos (como Judit), literatura no inspirada como los demás libros de la Biblia. El libro de Judit es una novela, que no hace referencias a hechos que realmente hayan ocurrido. La Biblia Latinoamericana de 1995 (Católica), comenta respecto a Judit:<br>  <br>  "...este libro quería ilustrar el arrojo y el espíritu de fe que habían hecho posible la revuelta y las victorias de tiempos de los Macabeos" (pag. 883)<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado.|`|561cb02117ede087a5c0939268dcd781aa	Quien es Judith?<br>  Saludos|`|0cd90997d8419f0424b95b410a066355aa	nene es una historia real y muy bella eh!!<br>  b<br>  e<br>  s<br>  i<br>  t<br>  o<br>  s<br>  b<br>  y<br>  e|`|30790bbb9926b5eb7350dfceb8bceff7aa	Jesús Dijo: "Yo soy el pan vivo, bajado del cielo, si uno come de este Pan, vivirá para siempre...El que como mi Carne y bebe mi Sangre, Tiene vida eterna...permanece en mí y yo en él" (Jn 6, 51. 54. 56) <br>  La Eucaristía junto con el Bautismo, son los "Sacramentos mayores" de la Iglesia. En la Eucaristía tenemos los cristianos la fuente y el culmen de nuestra vida personal y comunitaria. El comer la carne de Cristo y el beber su sangre nos hace participar en su vida y nos constituye en la comunidad de hermanos que es la Iglesia.<br>  Pese a todo eso, son muchos los cristianos que acuden a la celebración eucarística para cumplir con una "obligación, rutina o puro convencionalismo social", y que participan en ella ignorando la fraternidad y el amor que en ella se significan.|`|67bef59a7c613247a8ed5c2ed35107b5aa	mm igoles. nop.|`|8df7c54f3d5a1935481c5749d93019b8aa	?por que no está inspirado por Dios?, léelas y me cuentas, no se por que no se admiten.|`|e7b08abb7d70ed3206ca2741d3b3982faa	Te cuento que antiguamente existía lo que llaman  la "tradición del pueblo de Dios"...en que consistía esto? se contaban las historia de lo que había pasado en el "pasado".

(Mr 4:22; Lu 8:17; Col 2:3.) En lo que respecta a escritos, en un principio aplicaba a los que no se leían en público y por lo tanto estaban "ocultados" de otros. Sin embargo, más tarde esa palabra adquirió el significado de espurio o no canónico, y en la actualidad se suele usar con referencia a los escritos que la Iglesia católica romana declaró parte del canon bíblico en el Concilio de Trento (1546). Los escritores católicos los llaman deuterocanónicos, que significa "del segundo [o posterior] canon", a diferencia de los protocanónicos.<br>  <br>  Estos escritos que se a?adieron son: Tobías, Judit, Sabiduría (de Salomón), Eclesiástico (no Eclesiastés), Baruc, Primero y Segundo de los Macabeos, a?adiduras al libro de Ester y tres a?adiduras a Daniel: el Cántico de los tres jóvenes, la Historia de Susana y la Historia de Bel y el dragón. No se puede precisar con exactitud cuándo se escribieron, pero se sabe que no fue antes del siglo II o III a. E.C.<br>  <br>  Prueba en contra de su canonicidad. Aunque en algunos casos estos escritos tienen cierto valor histórico, afirmar que son canónicos carece de base sólida. Los hechos indican que el canon hebreo se completó después de la escritura de los libros de Esdras, Nehemías y Malaquías, en el siglo V a. E.C. Los escritos apócrifos nunca se incluyeron en el canon judío de las Escrituras inspiradas y no forman parte de ellas en la actualidad.<br>  <br>  El historiador judío Josefo, del primer siglo, indica que solo se daba reconocimiento a aquellos pocos libros (del canon hebreo) que se consideraban sagrados. Dijo: "Por esto entre nosotros no hay multitud de libros que discrepen y disientan entre sí; sino solamente veintidós libros [el equivalente de los treinta y nueve libros de las Escrituras Hebreas según la división moderna], que abarcan la historia de todo tiempo y que, con razón, se consideran divinos". Después demuestra que conoce la existencia de los libros apócrifos y su exclusión del canon hebreo, al a?adir: "Además, desde el imperio de Artajerjes hasta nuestra época, todos los sucesos se han puesto por escrito; pero no merecen tanta autoridad y fe como los libros mencionados anteriormente, pues ya no hubo una sucesión exacta de profetas". (Contra Apión, libro I, sec. 8.)|`|4faa029b855c54005c9453c4537c9396aa	Esyoy seguro que la biblia esta' basada en parte de  leyendas esta es una de ellas ''|`|78fd8f0cb22ba14d350b450f0c9a06a0aa	Perdona,pero para  ti,no es  ni una leyenda  ni  una historia  real,es una ROSA DIVINA  ,  pero  cuando  tu  la tomas  te  pinchas, por eso  no la agarras ni la conoces|`|b8436f3eb5903a2c6ebab2ae97683ab1aa	toda es inspirada por Dios<br>  hay que tomar en cuenta el papel de la mujer como Judit|`|f95bf7b99edc9f61424885fff25aa8b2aa	El libro de Judith es uno de los denominados Deuterocanónicos, y si bien figura en las versiones católicas de la Biblia, no está en las protestantes, quienes consideran apócrifos a estos libros.

1eb4fb200d7d0d65ac3a9bda9cd48199aa	No son negocios pero te dare respuestas...<br>  <br>  Iglesia:<br>  En el griego secular, el término significaba una reunión de gente, tal como un cuerpo político debidamente citado, o, en general, una asamblea.  En la LXX ekkl'sía es traducción casi exclusiva del heb. qahal, "congregación", "reunión", "asamblea"       (1 R. 8:14, 22; 1 Cr. 13:2; etc.).  El uso que se le da en el NT parece estar basado en el de la LXX. En tiempos del NT el término se aplica con mayor frecuencia al cuerpo de personas que creen en Jesús como el Mesías y lo aceptan, viven sus ense?anzas y<br>  están unidos en una organización creada por Jesús (Mt. 16:18; 1 Co. 3:11; Mt. 28:19, 20; Mr. 16:15, 16; Hch. 2:38, 41, 47; 16:13; Ro. 12:4, 5; 1 Co.12:12). En Hch. 7:38 se lo usa para referirse a la congregación de los israelitas. Cuando se lo emplea para la iglesia cristiana tiene varios matices de significación: 1. Una reunión eclesiástica (1 Co. 11:18).  2. El total de cristianos que viven en un lugar (4:17).  3. La iglesia universal (Mt. 16:18).<br>  <br>  Después de la ascensión de Jesús, el liderazgo de la iglesia recayó naturalmente sobre los apóstoles. Cuando surgió una necesidad, 573 se dio cargos directivos a otros (Hch. 6:2-6).  La iglesia se concentró primero en Jerusalén (Lc. 24:47; Hch. 1:8; 10:39; 15:2), pero más tarde se extendió a otras partes (Hch. 1:8; 8:1; etc.). Aparentemente, los primeros miembros fueron<br>  exclusivamente judíos (Hch. 11:19), pero más tarde los gentiles se constituyeron en mayoría. A medida que surgían congregaciones en diversos lugares, se designaron líderes locales (Hch. 14:21-23; 20:17; etc.; 1 Ti. 3:1-13)<br>  <br>  El requisito básico para entrar a la iglesia cristiana era aceptar a Jesús como el Mesías (Hch. 2:38; 4:10-12; 5:30, 31; etc,). Con respecto a otras doctrinas, las creencias de la iglesia naciente eran muy similares a las del judaísmo. Los cristianos, tanto judíos como gentiles, asistían a las sinagogas el sábado para escuchar la interpretación de los escritos de Moisés (13:42-44;15:13, 14, 21). Con el tiempo, al surgir diversos movimientos<br>  cismáticos en la iglesia, se vio la necesidad de desarrollar y clarificar las doctrinas (1 Ti. 6:20; 2 P. 2:15-19; 1 Jn. 2:18, 19; 4:1-3; 5:10; 17-19).  La iglesia debía completar la obra que Israel había dejado sin hacer:representar el carácter de Dios ante el mundo (Mt. 28:19; Ro. 2:28, 29; Gá. 3:28, 29; Ef. 2:8-22; 1 P. 2:5-10) y prepararse para el retorno de su Se?or (1 Co. 1:7, 8; 2 P. 3:14;  Ap. 14:5; etc.).<br>  <br>  Templo:<br>  Traducción del:  1. Heb. y aram. hêkal (un término derivado del sum.-ac. ekallu, derivado a su vez del sum.  E-GAL, "palacio",  "templo" o, literalmente, "casa grande"), que se aplicó también al tabernáculo en Silo (1 S. 1:9; 3:3) y a la morada de Dios en el cielo (2 S. 22:7).  2. Heb. , "casa", "templo",<br>  aplicada al templo de Dios (2 Cr. 35:20) y también a algún templo pagano (1 Cr. 10:10).  En muchos pasajes donde bayith ha sido traducida por "casa" se refiere a un templo, ya sea de una divinidad pagana (Jue. 9:46; 2 R. 10:21; etc..) o al templo de Dios en Jerusalén (1 R. 6:2-10; etc.).  Se consideraba que el templo era fundamentalmente la morada de la divinidad, y sólo en segunda instancia un lugar de culto.  3. Gr. hierón (Mt. 4:5; 12:5, 6; etc.).  4. Gr. naós (Mt. 23:16; etc.).  En términos estrictos, hierón se aplica a todo el templo, con sus edificios auxiliares y sus atrios o patios; mientras que naós designa el<br>  santuario sagrado del edificio del templo, que estaba formado por el "lugar santo" y el "lugar santísimo".<br>  <br>  Todas las naciones de la antigüedad construyeron templos para sus dioses. <br>  Algunos de ellos eran estructuras complicadas, que abarcaban muchas hectáreas, y estaban constituidas por magníficos edificios y patios.|`|3f2e64812962b868664c92e05ca1541daa	Hay que ver el significado de cada palabra; Templo es un edificio o lugar destinado pública y exclusivamente a un culto. e Iglesia viene del hebreo eclesia que significa congregacion refiriendose al lugar donde se reunian para escuchar ense?anza de Dios.|`|8a889c12651d2e0a3bd08d1233d9f15caa	Pues partiendo de que ya estás hablando de que los dos son "negocios"... ya ni para que te explico.

12b0e776ebc0fa2788cc86af17806c14aa	Existe lo que se llaman versiones. Las versiones dependen del público al que van dirigidas, sin faltar a la veracidad. Algunas son traducciones del original, pero otras son traducciones de traducciones ( como la segunda que mencionas) La biblia católica no es diferente, sino las demás. Ella fue la primera y la más completa traducida de los rollos originales. A la biblia católica no le sobran libros, sino al revés, a las demás le faltan. ?En cuál creer? Depende, porque en algunas hay diferencias imperceptibles para el lector común. No es lo mismo escribir Espíritu Santo con mayúscula que con minúscula. La Iglesia Católica reconoce al Espíritu Santo como el nombre propio de la tercera persona de la Santísima Trinidad, pero para aquellos que lo hacen con minúscula sólo es una "cosa" , sin embargo llama la atención que la palabra "Diablo" sí la escriben con mayúscula y eso es una diferencia doctrinal y en consecuencia de fe.

(ROMANOS 12:18.)<br>  Las personas imperfectas no consiguen la paz de manera automática, por lo que Pedro dijo que todo cristiano debe 'buscarla y seguir tras ella' (1 Pedro 3:11). ?Cómo lo hacemos? Encontramos la respuesta en una profecía antigua. Jehová dijo mediante Isaías: "Todos tus hijos serán personas ense?adas por Jehová, y la paz de tus hijos será abundante" (Isaías 54:13; Filipenses 4:9). En efecto, es prestando atención a las ense?anzas de Jehová como se obtiene la paz auténtica. Además, esta, junto con 'el amor, el gozo, la gran paciencia, la benignidad, la bondad, la fe, la apacibilidad y el autodominio', constituye el fruto del espíritu santo de Dios (Gálatas 5:22, 23). No disfruta de paz quien no es amoroso, no tiene gozo, es impaciente, poco amable, malvado, no tiene fe, es violento o carece de autodominio.|`|4d2c66dcee62f08c979d94b832e91198aa	porque uno cuando acepta "su verdad" se apega mucho a como <br>  y la defiende a toda costa y siempre creera que la de ellos es la verdadera, debemos de respetar todas al menos si no nos interesa escuchar nada de ellas tampoco atacarlas<br>  <br>  besitos|`|9338fcf442869e79ce7ddc8692dec9c9aa	por la intolerancia , asi de sencillo;<br>  <br>  cada religion o secta debe creer en lo que quieran creer y dejar de querer "jalar" adeptos dejar en paz a la demas gente que piense y crea en lo que deseen, ademas deben abstenerse de atacarse ya que como no se les cae la cara de verguenza de decir que se sienten cerca de Dios con semejantes batallas campales!! mas lejos de El ya no pueden estar<br>  <br>  Ah y s e te olvido mencionar a los musulmanes con su fanatismo, son iguales que los que dices, o creo que mas terribles porque hasta cometen actos terroristas, llevandose entre las patas a gente inocente y todo por su estupida conviccion que se van a ir con Ala por atreverse a eso...<br>  y me expreso asi porque no s evale que muera gente pòr su culpa, por sus creencias fanaticas; si no afectara a nadie me daria igual......saludos|`|b41435457673ebbf86688aad6f3de92eaa	Porque ninguno de ellos es un verdadero creyente.

e1a1f381a6a593980ed750f67bf70f11aa	En el mundo bíblico, donde la riqueza y la seguridad dependían de tener el mayor número posible de hijos, la abstinencia sexual y las prácticas sexuales no reproductivas (homosexualidad, prostitución, coitus interruptus, masturbación, etc.) eran condenadas. Al difundirse el cristianismo en el mundo mediterráneo, la nueva religión se vio influenciada por el platonismo, que consideraba al espíritu como algo ideal y puro, y a la materia como impura y aprisionadora, por lo que la sexualidad fue vista como algo “malo”. Alrededor del a?o 1000, la iglesia católica occidental (a diferencia de las iglesias orientales, como la griega) impuso a sus sacerdotes el celibato obligatorio, únicamente por razones económicas (para no sostener a las familias de los sacerdotes). De esta manera los sacerdotes y monjas perdieron toda opción para expresar libremente su sexualidad.<br>  La sexualidad es natural en los seres humanos y a partir de la pubertad la líbido comienza manifestarse como un fuerte impulso. En una encuesta reciente del IMSS en México, 95 % de los hombres encuestados y 75 % de las mujeres declararon masturbarse con bastante frecuencia. Los sacerdotes y monjas no son en nada diferentes, excepto en que muchos de ellos viven bajo una fuerte represión y un sentimiento patológico de culpa. Cuando escuches a un sacerdote hablando de lo pecaminoso de la masturbación, probablemente se está dirigiendo a sí mismo. Un gran teólogo aleman, Eugen Drewerman, efectuó un estudio entre sacerdotes católicos, encontrando que mucho de ellos padecían gran número de patologías debido a la represión sexual. Muchos se masturbaban y experimentaban terribles depresiones provocadas por sentimientos de culpa. La soledad terrible en la que viven, la falta de intimidad y de confianza, el temor a ser denunciados a los superiores, hace que muchos de ellos desarrollen una fuerte atracción hacia su mismo sexo. Algunos clérigos han optado por tener esposas y familias ocultas. Otros se volvían cínicos y recurrian a la prostitución.<br>  En algunas religiones de oriente (hinduismo, budismo, taoismo,..) los monjes hacen votos temporales ó perpetuos de castidad. Pero para hacer esto cuentan con técnicas muy desarrolladas para aprender a manejar el impulso sexual como una energía que sirva a fines espirituales. Ello implica que no reprimen sus impulsos sexuales, sino que los subliman, mediante prácticas como el yoga kundalini ó artes marciales como el kung fu. Evidentemente, se requiere de una gran disciplina y autodominio y no todos lo logran. Aquellos que fracasan tiene la opción de volver a comenzar ó de casarse y seguir en su búsqueda espiritual como monjes casados. Grandes maestros espirituales, como Marpa el tibetano ó Padmasambhava el maestro hind, estuvieron casados.<br>  En resumen, la iglesia católica debería de parar de culpabilizar a aquellos de sus fieles que se masturban, pues la castidad total sin ningún entrenamiento no es algo real. El celibato en sus clérigos debería de ser opcional y cuando alguien escoja ser célibe (monje ó monja) debe de dársele apoyo sicológico y espiritual para que logre alcanzar este fin.|`|2ff9f8bf1422076ef2989de25d2bd2a1aa	Se lo cortan, para que no tengan que preocuparse por eso.|`|31bc5ed6084e15ff14bc18fdc9e8e0a7aa	No se abstienen.|`|3ffa4e77422dbeab3a8bcd5c508188ffaa	?EN SERIO CREES QUE SE ABSTIENE?|`|663beaab35c940f59764d3b139ad6c9aaa	buena pregunta... yo lo considero o imposible o meramente como un acto de voluntar inquebrantable... pero... mmm... no creo que aguanten toda su vida sin una chaqueta minimo.|`|68775f860c96796a28c2f9ed29ef9c7faa	abstenerce al sexo???? la respuesta es no!!!!|`|6f5ae5d08085427bd04b6f35adb8a2e7aa	hombres de poca fe ja,ja,ja,ja,ja,|`|85d569525fcf2d08bf2fcdeddcaa9dfaaa	Ellos hacen votos,pero en la intimidad sólo los ve Dios y con él se las arreglarán el día que lo tengan enfrente.En el a?o 1075 a través de un dogma hubo divorcios al por mayor:Gregorio Vll obligó a los clérigos a divorciarse de sus esposas.<br>    Muchas veces los hombres imponen leyes que contrarían la Palabra de Dios.En ninguna parte de la Biblia dice que los sacerdotes no se pueden casar.Por el contrario los sacerdotes de siglos antes de Gregorio Vll estaban casados y tenían sus familias.En la Biblia ,Nuevo Testamento,1ra.de Corintios 7:9 dice BIEN CLARO que el que no tiene el don de continencia se case, para no quemarse.Esto quiere decir para no pecar.Porque está bien claro,que el sexo fuera del matrimonio es PECADO.<br>  Tambien los fariseos dijeron: Has lo que yo digo y no lo que yo hago...Por lo tanto ,no somos Dios para saber que o como,lo hacen o no.Simplemente tienen la misma necesidad y derecho que cualquier otro hombre,porque así nacieron y sacerdotes los hicieron.Por una ley inventada por un hombre, hoy más de un clérigo comete el pecado de fornicar.Más de un "católico" también peca y vos quizás seas uno de esos,porque lo que dice la Biblia en la cita mencionada NO SóLO ES PARA LOS SACERDOTES SINO PARA TODOS,HOMBRES Y MUJERES.|`|ad600bf409903839d42a10e4315a4669aa	Piden ayuda a Dios para que les de la fuerza de abstenimiento.. por medio de la oración....|`|b08ab86cd09370b2c134b685bb4373e8aa	No se puede generalizar que se abstengan pero tampoco se puede generalizar que todos lo hagan.<br>  Hay de todo en este mundo, pero, los que se abstienen es porque realmente hicieron votos de castidad y aparte, están en oración, como dijeron anteriormente.|`|b6d8af12ed1b3d2da96990d8f6f85c03aa	Corrección:<br>  <br>  El monaguillo es un ni?o que ayuda durante las celebraciones al sacerdote, por lo que el no tiene votos ni tiene una vida consagrada.

0de23c68c5e198b6ee94f0b2dcfe8b94aa	Cada tentación es una oportunidad para hacer el bien.<br>  Es el camino hacía la madurez espiritual, o una ocasión para hacer lo correcto, aunque es el arma principal de satanás para destruí, Dios quiere usarla para nuestro desarrollo.<br>  Cada vez que escogemos hacer lo bueno en lugar de pecar, estaremos madurando en el carácter de Cristo.<br>  Cuando el Espíritu Santo controla nuestras vidas, él producirá este tipo de fruto en nosotros como son el amor, la paz, la paciencia, la benignidad, la bondad, la fidelidad, la mansedumbre, y el auto control.<br>  Esto así es un hermoso retrato de Jesús, porque El es perfecto, <br>  La tentación nos ayuda a saber que satanás, ha usado las mismas estrategias y viejas artima?as desde la creación y todas siguen al mismo modelo, por esto Pablo nos dijo.<br>  "No ignoramos sus artima?as . La tentación siempre empieza en la mente, no en las circunstancias porque Jesús dijo: "Porque de adentro, del corazón humano, salen los malos pensamientos, la inmoralidad sexual, los robos, los homicidios, los adulterios, la avaricia, la maldad, el enga?o, el libertinaje, la envidia, la calumnia, la arrogancia, y la necedad. Todos estos males viene de adentro y contaminan a la persona  y Santiago nos dice: hay un ejercito de malos deseos dentro de nosotros.<br>  El otro es la duda que satanás trata de conseguir que dudemos de lo que Dios ha dicho sobre el pecado y el otro es el enga?o ya que satanás es incapaz de decir la verdad y por esto la Biblia le llama el padre de la mentira porque cualquier cosa que nos diga será falsa o una verdad a medias y ofrece sus mentiras para reemplazar lo que Dios ya ha dicho en su palabra.<br>  satanás dice: "No morirás. Serás tan sabios, como Dios. Puedes salirte con la tuya. Nadie lo sabrá, se resolverán tus problemas, Además todos lo hacen, Sólo es un pecado peque?o, Pero un pecado peque?o nos hace estar distantes de Dios o lejos del paraíso que es la paz que Dios da.<br>  Otro es la desobediencia, Se llega a ceder ante lo que llama la atención y crees las mentiras de satanás, y caemos en las trampas, de la que nos advierte Santiago: Cada uno es tentado cuando de sus propios malos deseos lo arrastran y seducen. Luego, cuando el deseo ha concebido, engendra el pecado, y el pecado una vez que ha sido consumado, da a luz la muerte. Mis queridos hermanos no se enga?en.<br>  Esto en cuanto a la muerte espiritual lógicamente es que se refiere., por tanto Adán y Eva, fueron libres de hacer su voluntad cuando se dejaron seducir por satanás en la serpiente y le creyeron más a la mentira que a Dios, además   Dios los dejó en el jardín para que disfrutaran de lo que El había creado y así como Abraham fue probado en cuanto al hijo Isaac lo probó para ver su obediencia, pero Dios no los indujo a hacer lo que ellos hicieron.

Quien presume de haberse leído la biblia y creer en su mensaje debería saber que el mordisqueo de la manzana tendría sus consecuencias en nuestro mundo actual. Si crees en la leyenda del pecado original, Eva, la Pecadora, sería  culpable de la tentación de Adán y, por tanto, ambos serían culpables de la cadena perpetua a la que estamos destinados todos nosotros. El hombre y la mujer, según la biblia, recibieron su castigo y fueron expulsados del jardín del edén... Pero su pecado deja huella, es inevitable, así fue la decisión de Dios: todos sus descendientes deberán pagar eternamente por sus actos: la humanidad pagará por sus culpas... Es el castigo de Dios.

Entonces, acaso no tenia dios derecho a sentir ese mínimo acto de obediencia por parte de sus hijos humanos, de no comer del árbol. Por otra parte les dio libre albedrío para que hicieran lo que quisieran.<br>  dios todo lo sabe y todo lo puede saber del futuro, pero lo hace si desea, o sea puede saber el futuro si desea saber el futuro, confiaba en que sus hijos humanos no comieran del árbol.<br>  Por otra parte nadie es culpable de que Satanás hiciera pecar a Eva, como nadie es culpable de que Eva pecara y que hiciera pecar a la vez a adán; pero lamentablemente perdieron las condiciones que dios les habia regaladom, incluso la vida eterna; no obstante lo que les esperaria hacia el futuro y lo que nos esperaria como hijos o descendientes de adan y eva, dios si lo previo, y por eso mismo, en el mismo instante en que declaro su condena a adan y eva, asi como a satanas o la serpiente original, tambien, en ese mismo instante hizo la provicion de salvacion, o sea dio el medio para resolver la situacion, por lo que entregaria a su hijo que naceria como humano perfecto, en sacrificio, a cambio o en rescate por la vida perfecta que perdio adan, y eso permitiria que la humanidad recuperara nnuevamente su perfeccion y su salvacion.<br>  Nadie será torturado ni atormentado eternamente, eso es un invento humano, no existe el infierno que ense?an las religiones solo es la forma de manipular a la gente y hacer que hagan lo que ellos dicen o desean.<br>  La muerte es la paga del pecado, adán y su descendencia fueron condenados a envejecer y morir, solo eso. Jamas dios les dijo que después de morir serian atormentados eternamente en un infierno de fuego.<br>  Dios es un padre amoroso, es su principal cualidad, por tanto no permitiría que sus hijos humanos sufrirán tal castigo, sobre todo aquellos que nada tuvieron que ver con la rebelión en edén. la maravillosa provisión de dar a su hijo en sacrificio fue la solución definitiva para este asunto, por tanto al tiempo se?alado la maldad será borrada de nuestro planeta y recuperaremos y reconstruiremos el paraíso perdido por adán.|`|0572648c9a8141039a56ccf075d8365eaa	ya te diste cuenta que la biblia solo es un cuento ? un libro muy famoso con millones de fans, esa pregunta me la hice cuando tenia 7 a?os, no se.. nunca pero nunca  lo juro, por mas que me quisieron meter ideas a la cabeza, nunca me crei esa historia.|`|4ca01a94cdf80338bc3ea34142d13e6baa	No tienes que sufrir eternamente, para eso Dios mismo se hizo carne y vino a este mundo a dar su vida por nosotros, ese es el plan perfecto de Dios, el plan de la salvación, tú eliges: O La luz o las tinieblas, eres libre de elegir; Jesús es el camino, la verdad y la vida; y solo por medio de la fe en él puedes tener vida eterna y ser libre del pecado; él nos limpia de todo pecado, incluyendo el de Adan y Eva.

d8623eb41920f196502cb6622786b82eaa	El verbo bailar aparece por cuatro ocasiones en la revisión 60 de la versión Reina Valera de la Biblia.<br>  <br>  La primera en Jueces 21:21 que dice: "y estad atentos; y cuando veáis salir a las hijas de Silo a bailar en corros, salid de las vi?as, y arrebatad cada uno mujer para sí de las hijas de Silo, e idos a tierra de Benjamín"<br>  <br>  Esto tiene que ver con los 200 varones de Benjamín que aún no tenían esposas, quienes podían tomar esposas de entre las doncellas de Silo que bailaban en las fiestas anuales. Esta acción permitió a los hombres de Silo mantener su voto de no dar voluntariamente sus hijas a los de Benjamín.<br>  <br>  La segunda vez que aparece el verbo bailar es en Eclesiastés 3:4 que dice: La segunda vez que aparece el verbo bailar es en Eclesiastés 3:4 que dice: "tiempo de llorar, y tiempo de reír; tiempo de endechar y tiempo de bailar"<br>  <br>  Salomón está meditando en el soberano dise?o de Dios y concluye que todos los sucesos de la vida están divinamente establecidos. Hay un tiempo para llorar y otro para reír. Hay un tiempo para endechar o hacer luto y otro para bailar.<br>  <br>  La tercera y cuarta vez que aparece el verbo bailar es en el Nuevo Testamento en Mateo 11:17 y Lucas 7:32. Siendo que ambos textos se refieren al mismo asunto, vamos a leer solamente Mateo 11:17 "diciendo: Os tocamos flauta, y no bailasteis; os endechamos y no lamentasteis"<br>  <br>  Los judíos de la época de Jesús, no reaccionaban con nada. Estaban como estatuas. Vino Juan el Bautista y no le aceptaron. Vino Jesús y tampoco le aceptaron. Fueron como los muchachos que les tocaron flauta y no bailaron, les cantaron canciones fúnebres y no lamentaron.<br>  <br>  Aparte de esto, la Biblia no habla nada más sobre bailar. En ningún caso es condenado ni condonado. Pero Ud. dice que algunos personajes de la Biblia bailaron delante de Dios. Probablemente Ud. se refiere a que danzaron delante de Dios. Un caso típico fue David.<br>  <br>  2a Samuel 6:5 dice: "Y David y toda la casa de Israel danzaban delante de Jehová con toda clase de instrumentos de madera de haya; con arpas, salterios, panderos, flautas y címbalos"<br>  <br>  Según algunos estudiosos de la Biblia, en el Antiguo Testamento, esta danza era un movimiento giratorio hecho por una sola persona o por un grupo numeroso, jamás en pareja, un hombre con una mujer. Esto es todo lo que dice la Biblia sobre el baile y la danza.<br>  <br>  Muy bien, pero su consulta es: ?Por que se dice que bailar es pecado, si como hemos visto, la Biblia habla de bailar y danzar? El asunto parte de la diferencia entre el baile en la actualidad y el baile en los tiempos del Antiguo Testamento.<br>  <br>  Existe una gran diferencia.<br>  <br>  En los tiempos bíblicos, el baile o la danza era ejecutado por una sola persona o por un grupo de personas y al menos en el caso de David y los que con él estaban, fue una manifestación del gozo que tenían delante de Jehová por lo que él era o había hecho.<br>  <br>  En cambio, en la actualidad, el baile tiene una connotación totalmente diferente. El baile hoy en día para comenzar es en parejas. Un hombre con una mujer. El baile en la actualidad no es una manifestación de alabanza o adoración al Se?or como fue en los tiempos del Antiguo Testamento, sino una forma de diversión en el mejor de los casos, o de goce sensual en la mayoría de los casos.<br>  <br>  Las parejas que bailan hoy en día no están pensando en Dios sino en ellos mismos. Ya sea en divertirse o en dar rienda suelta a la pasión de la carne. No estamos afirmando que sea malo divertirse. Lo malo está en incitar pasiones impropias en otros.<br>  <br>  Mucho del baile de hoy en día tiene que ver con movimientos sensuales que despiertan pensamientos y actitudes nada dignas en los demás. Esto, es lo que caracteriza a los bailarines de hoy en día, amén de problemas con el alcohol, la música ofensiva, los celos, las envidias, etc.<br>  <br>  Si somos honestos con nosotros mismos admitiremos que no existe baile social hoy en día donde no estén presentes situaciones que desdicen el carácter cristiano. Por eso es que los creyentes debemos evitar esta conducta.<br>  <br>  El baile es una práctica muy típica del mundo, pero note lo que dice 1a Juan 2:15-16 "No améis al mundo, ni las cosas que están en el mundo. Si alguno ama al mundo, el amor del Padre no está en él. Porque todo lo que hay en el mundo, los deseos de la carne, los deseos de los ojos y la vanagloria de la vida, no proviene del Padre, sino del mundo"<br>  <br>  En todo baile, se manifiesta exactamente lo que afirma este texto. Allí afloran los deseos de la carne, allí afloran los deseos de los ojos y sobre todo, allí aflora la vanagloria de la vida. La responsabilidad de todo creyente es no amar este sistema. Por eso no es recomendable que un creyente ande en bailes.<br>  <br>  Además la palabra del Se?or nos da una ense?anza muy pertinente en 1a Corintios 10:31 que dice: "Si, pues, coméis o bebéis, o hacéis otra cosa, hacedlo todo para la gloria de Dios"<br>  <br>  Todo lo que hace el creyente debe ser motivado por un afán de glorificar a Dios. Glorificar a Dios significa manifestar alguno de sus atributos. Es dudable que en un baile de hoy en día se manifieste alguno de los atributos de Dios y por tanto no es una actividad que trae gloria a Dios.|`|33b5105241d0e46bab270408edcb9d42aa	Sí, te irás al Infierno, blasfemo.|`|5ad8b7606a0f97e69377f5eceda86301aa	No sera en la presencia de Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos<br>  <a href="http://www.albertogarcia.ws/" rel="nofollow">http://www.albertogarcia.ws/</a>|`|eDfz6ejTaa	Porque a veces la gente usa la religion como un pretexto para reprimir y sacar ventajas de poder.|`|hpq3sYJgaa	Bailar no es pecado.

Yo creo que no más cumplen con una obligación ética que fue la que ellos mismos eligieron, como estilo de vida, y la que prodigan, ni más ni menos. <br>  Que hay muchos católicos que viven una vida humanitaria y de caridad y solidaridad y amor al prójimo, sí, es cierto. Pero siendo lo que predican, y esgrimiéndose como ejemplo y norma, dado que ellos son los que edifican las pautas eclesiásticas, y de la feligresía, da mucho que pensar que haya tantos depravados, deshonestos, pedófilos, ladrones, cómplices de las fuerzas represoras, etc, etc. <br>  De todas maneras, no creo que la depravación moral les quepa sólo a los miembros eclesiásticos, puesto que creo que la sociedad actual está muy desgastada en valores trascendentales, y los mencionados no serían más que parte de tal sociedad.
5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	I think the womens rights movement is making us feel like we have to be assertive.  So in the past men made us submissive, now feminists are making us assertive.  We should be able to be any way we feel comfortable and not feel like less of a woman because of it.

I mind sexist guys, but honestly I find feminists worse. I believe in having the same rights and I live like this, but I like that a man lets me pass first or gives me his hand to help. I like these old fashioned manners. I knew women who made a big scandal if a guy let them first through a door. I don't believe that wearing only pants, not wearing makeup, not caring how I look like, being tough, aggressive  and trying to boss everybody around, and always bringing up the gender theme has anything to do with women rights, to be honest.<br>  Women rights are about equal treatment - I can demand to be treated the same as any guy is treated, study and get a job as well paid as his, and still paint my nails, wear dresses, do the washing at home...

35a39309ad4c1a1842181486233adb72aa	Mira, no es bueno querer que el otro te haga caso. Por más que utilices todas tus estrategias no lo lograrás. Si estás en pareja y le exijes al otro algo que quizá él no pueda darte, no es fácil y no se arregla con sólo gritarle y refunfu?arle lo que quieres. Si lo que quieres de él es muy importante, pues tienes que decirle lo que buscas en él (él nunca lo adivinará) y tal vez te lo dé de una vez o tal vez necesiten un tiempo para pensar, porque si tu pareja no tiene lo que tú necesitas, no puedes seguir con él, sólo te lastimaras insistiéndole con aquéllo que quieres y escuchando que él no puede dártelo. Pero por sobretodas las cosas tienes que entender que una pareja no es una competencia en la que se disputan dos personas para ver quién le hace caso a quién. La pareja es linda cuando se acompa?an el uno al otro y hay complicidad. No sé bien cuál será tu caso pero espero que te sirva. En algún momento yo también me he comido las u?as pensando que mi novio no me hacía caso, pero me di cuenta que era una tontería porque nadie puede obligar a otros a hacer cosas que no quieren.|`|13ff102ff3ec66c3af37068b45fc72a5aa	Prometele ke si te ase caso vos le tiras la goma ajajjaaj<br>  <br>  <br>  un chiste sory. ya se ke el tema era serio pero no lo pude evitar|`|4e67700fdcd772d7bc0762cd5123aa2eaa	todo depende de si eres hombre o mujer, cuales son tus fines, y deberías ir pensando en comprarte un perrito...ellos te hacen caso siempre, si los educas!!!|`|7aa77daec2ec0c3e53dca38907b00f28aa	Solo te puedo contestar con la pura verdad.... El hombre es un animal de Instinto y la mujer es un ser Mas que todo sentimental... Al hombre lo puedes atrapar por sus instintos.. eso nunca falla, al igual que a ustedes las mujeres se les atrapa por los sentimientos...de alli el hecho de que a muchos hombres se les perdona la infidelidad (ojo, estoy diciendo que a muchos, no a todos) debido a que su pareja sabe inconcientemente acerca del deseo instintivo del hombre mientras que es muy raro que un hombre perdone una infidelidad de una mujer, dado que en la mayoria de los casos, cuando una mujer se entrega sexualmente es porque ya esta inmiscuyendo sus sentimientos, mientras que el hombre solo imiscuye su sexo.

a0b5078f4bc9166e55ec30c7d0ce5b79aa	Si entiendo tu pregunta, la respuesta es un sí relativo.<br>  El habla de una persona no puede por si sola influir en el idioma, no de manera inmediata por lo menos, pero sí el habla de un grupo de personas. Ferdinand de Saussure, el padre de la lngüística  separo a los idiomas en Habla y Lengua, siendo la última la parte escrita.<br>  Saussure dijo que mientras la lengua era estática, el habla era dinámica, yo no estoy de acuerdo con esto ya que la lengua también se mueve, solo que más lentamente que el habla.<br>  Como ejemplo, lo único que se me ocurre en este momento es una palabra del lunfardo argentino, laburo, que significa trabajo, la cuestión es que a medida que fueron llegando inmigrantes italianos a la Argentina, quienes mencionaban la palabra Lavoro para referirse al trabajo, los demás habitantes, hispanoparlantes, comenzaron a utilizar esta expresión y la deformaron hasta llegar a la palabra Laburo que se utiliza aun hoy en día,<br>  Resumiendo, el habla de una persona no puede influir en la lengua a menos que se propague lo suficiente, claro que esto siempre empieza por uno solo, y luego gana más adeptos.<br>  Hoy en día es más facil que un individuo cambie el idioma, ya que con los medios de comunicación masivos, un personaje mediático lo suficientemente popular puede imponer formas de vestir, de actuar y hasta de pensar, y obviamente también puede incluír nuevos términos en el habla popular.<br>  Espero te ayude mi respuesta.<br>  Saludos.|`|12818bea70131ce407f0f03925074c88aa	no creo aunque creo que esta mal planteada su pregunta|`|o1LvSs77aa	Tal vez a la larga pueda hacerlo.

b05b532d4b9a2d629b00d171d8381c7daa	Hola. Bueno serán los jóvenes de piel clara, blancos de todos los países de América. Pues en mi país Perú, no hay tantos negros o zambos (mestizos con gente indígena, o sea de piel cobriza, los hay en la parte sur de Lima), la mayoría de población del Perú es Mestiza, o sea somos trigue?os, el color como está en mi avatar. El Perú es un crisol de razas, ha habido tanto mestizaje, que sólo sabemos que somos mestizos con los antiguos peruanos y la gente que vino al Perú. Lamentablemente en mi país hay muchísimos racistas, especialmente la gente de Lima, de los barrios residenciales, de la gente blanca que son descendientes de europeos. Incluso hasta hay discotecas que han sido denunciadas por no dejar entrar a la gente trigue?a ni negra, sólo a blancos, qué vergüenza por mi país que exista esta clase de gente. También los de la costa marginan a la gente de la sierra, o sea la gente que tienen rasgos andinos. Y nada que hablar de los europeos, porque son muy racistas. Una amiga espa?ola me dijo que a toda gente que no es blanca, le llaman negros despectivamente. Esta palabra en mi país y otros de Latinoamérica se usa con cari?o para la gente negra y también algunos lo usan despectivamente.

Nuestras ambiciones o sue?os tambien incluyen la vida de otros. En lo posible hacer el bien, lo correcto, lo que dicta el sentido comun es suficiente para cambiar. Por supuesto hay gente a la que no le importa y se desentiende del problema y dicen "no que pena" pero el mundo de ahora no es así.

Ahora el ser mediocre está bien visto porque es una forma de llegarle al populacho ignorante sin importar el nivel social que la gente tenga. Una forma de hacer un cambio es instruir a los demás,ser más selectivos con lo que hacemos, leemos, decimos y tratar de hacer ver a lo demás que el tener un poco de cultura es algo bueno, éso sí sin ser vanidosos,ni tratando de hacer sentir a los demás que son inferiores.

Me gusta leer, me gusta escuchar, me gusta pensar y observar, y también discutir.

A mi ya me basta que haya gente con unos intereses y gente para otros.

El mundo está cada vez más fragmentado, la velocidad de la vida moderna requiere que todo sea instantáneo, superdinámico. Como verás, mucha gente achica las palabras al extremo para comunicarse a través de mensajes de texto o por internet.

Es la ley del mínimo esfuerzo la que nos rige, a tal extremo que si nos desviamos un poco de la corriente, hasta parecemos raros, no sentimos fuera de lugar. Por otra parte, disponemos de tanta y variada información y al instante y por tantos medios, que se convierte casi en un despropósito almacenar conocimientos en la mente, ?para qué? si están todos en Internet, en la tele o donde sea.

I believe there are shortcuts in life, but the thing about them is that they don't work out as well in the long run than if the harder way is done.  It's like you can cut corners on making a recipe, but if you want it to be good and tasteful... you gotta go the full way to have something enjoyed.  Those who do shortcuts in business usually end up having problems to deal with later.  Now that's not to say that should someone heed counsel given to them to avoid certain things that they can't have a shortcut in a sense... because they'll be head of the game by listening.  There are no shortcuts to becoming the spiritual person one needs to be in God... those who would serve Him must go the full route so it will last.  Sorry friend... but keep pushing.

If they just met you, they may be genuine or they might be just trying to flatter you.  If the person has gotten to know you and says that you're beautiful, they are being genuine and true.  Usually someone will get to know you first, before they say you're beautiful.  True beauty is deeper than the surface and comes from the heart and a person's relationship with God (if they have one).  If you have a Bible, please look up Proverbs 31:30 and 1 Peter 3:3-4.  I know one thing, God loves us and we are precious to Him and He is more concerned with our hearts then our outward appearance - 1 Samuel 16:7.

Because it was the juniors that had to learn the mechanics of operating the business.  Like restocking the inventory - carrying the cases of soda, beer cans/bottles, kegs of beer, washing the glasses, restocking the garnishes of lemon & lime twists, fruit and vegetable juice bottles for mixers, restocking plastic cups (not all drinks are served in glasses). Taking out the garbage that got missed from the night before. cleaning out the restrooms.<br>  Yeah its a lot of hard work!<br>  Even the senior bartenders have to help with a lot of the hard work, its team effort to run a business.<br>  More often than not as the junior (the BarBack) you will be too busy keeping the bar "in stock" while the senior bartenders are busy working and socializing with the customers.<br>  <br>  Why - did you have any funny ideas about working in a popular local night time hangout?<br>  <br>  Well good luck !<br>  <br>  But on the up end, eventually you will get promoted and get to work the bar and the customers, and some other junior will get to shlep all the heavy stuff for a change.  Thats where the money is in't it - in the tips.<br>  <br>  cheers baby !!!|`|684d937807da5838ecacca779e1a3a88aa	about a day.
0503dfdda8f336bc0ebfd0d886c52fc3aa	Hi Jennifer, how are you? God willing you will be ok, sorry about not writing before, I didn't have time, but well, here I am doing it, hehe. Tell me how is my beauty. Diego told me that the doctor already saw her foot and that she needs some "supports" (not sure about this, like crouches?). That is normal so the foot will heal and the sooner you do it the better., because when they grow, it becomes callused and it's difficult to walk. I hope it won't bother her too much to have this strange thing in her foot. Tomorrow is friday, Moira's mom is going over and I'll send some clothes for her.<br>  Let me tell you that I was excited about traveling with those plane tickets: US$ 300 from Santa Cruz to Miami and back, and then take the connection to Arkansas, but when I asked it only could be done within 25 days and the offer was for last Monday, so it will have to be some other time for when I can gather some money. Soon Gabriela's pictures will be ready. Pleas send me a picture or the negatives with Moira's mom, so that I can make some copies and put them in my bedroom.<br>  I have to go because I have to go to the bank. I'll write to you later. Kisses for you and my beautiful Gabriela.|`|2d4646f0afca7dbdf7cd52b9bae96078aa	Hello Jennifer, how are you doing?

Diego  told me that the doctor checked her foot and they have to put some supports on her foot, which is good so it can fix her feet and it's better to do it as soon as possible so they can grow right and she won't have trouble walking.

AA10241624	Porn isn't dis-allowed on free tv because Jesus said so. Porn and the other items you described are not shown on free tv to prevent those who should not be seeing such things from seeing them.  Children can be psychologically damaged by seeing these things unbidden.  While it is technically up to parents to regulate these things, we all know that they can't be there all the time to protect their children.  Porn, violence, etc. are all offered and you have absolute freedom to watch them. The Christian shows you see on tv are bought and paid for fairly by the people who produce them.  Though I might question how "christian" it is to try and get people to send you money for your tv show. None-the-less, there are plenty of atheistic shows on tv. Atheist Viewpoint for one.  A google search will provide many others.  As for the other religions you mentioned, they do have the freedom to speak out as well. I see it all the time in fact.  No one is infringiing on your rights. You do not have the right to watch porn on tv. You have the right to watch porn up to the point where it doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

One researcher proposed the<br>  expression "intelligent animal". After advanced studies<br>  on monkeys, it was dropped. Another researcher proposed<br>  "tool using animal". After observing some animals<br>  making wooden tools and sharpening them with knife like<br>  stones, it was dropped. Another researcher proposed<br>  "weapon using animal". A decade ago, a rare film was<br>  shot in African forests. One short monkey was hit very<br>  badly by a big monkey. The short monkey prepared a<br>  wooden knife using stones and hid it on the top of a<br>  tree. After some days, when the big monkey came to<br>  attack the short monkey, it ran up to the tree for the<br>  weapon it has hid and killed the big monkey. The one<br>  thing that the anthropologists found with any group of<br>  human beings, even if they did not have contacts with<br>  the out side world for thousands of years, is<br>  spirituality with some form of religion. So, man is a<br>  "spiritual animal" if you want to call him that way. <br>  <br>  The Upanishads say that "Manush" (human) was so named<br>  because he has "Manas" a mind higher than that of the<br>  animals which realises the divinity in creation.

Everyone has already seen or experienced the auric fields of others. The problem is that most people ignore the experience or chalk it up to something that it is not.<br>  <br>  Mystics from all parts of the world speak of seeing lights around people's heads, but you do not have to be a mystic to see the aura. Anyone can learn to see and experience the aura more effectively. There is nothing magical about the process. It involves recognizing it for what it is and not ignoring the experience. It simply involves a little understanding, time, practice and perseverance.<br>  <br>  Children are very good at seeing and experiencing the aura. Those experiences are often translated into their drawings. Around the figures, they will shade in unusual and different colors. These colors often reflect the subtle energies they have observed around what they are drawing.<br>  <br>  Have You Experienced the Auric Energy Field?<br>  <br>  1. When you are around some people do you feel drained?<br>  2. Do you associate certain colors with people? ?(For example, "You always     seem like a yellow person to      me.")<br>  3. Have you ever felt when someone was staring at you?<br>  4. Have you ever been able to sense how someone is feeling, in spite of how this person was acting?<br>  5. Do certain sounds, colors and fragrances make you feel more comfortable or uncomfortable?<br>  6. Do you find that some people excite or energine you more than others?<br>  7. Are some rooms more comfortable and enjoyable to be in than others? Do you notice the difference in     one room from the next? Did you ever notice how your brother's/sister's room feels different from yours? <br>  <br>  How about your parents's or children's?<br>  <br>  The human aura is the energy field that surrounds the physical body. It surrounds you in all directions. It is three dimensional. In a healthy individual, it makes an elliptical or egg shape about the body. I have heard it proposed that the auras of the ancient masters could extend outward from the body for several miles. It is often believed that this is one of the reasons they could draw such large numbers of followers in any area where they traveled. It is worth noting that a common depiction of many masters included the halo, a portion of the aura that is most easily seen by the average individual.<br>  <br>  The aura is weakened by:<br>  1. Poor diet<br>  2. Lack of exercise<br>  3. Lack of fresh air<br>  4. Lack  of rest<br>  5. Stress<br>  6. Alcohol<br>  7. Drugs<br>  8. Tobacco<br>  9. Negative habits<br>  10. Improper psychic activity<br>  <br>  FEELING AND EXPERIENCING SUBTLE ENERGIES<br>  <br>  The in and out movement of the hands causes the energy surrounding them to accumulate between them, making it more perceptible to you. The hands are becoming more sensitive to the subtle energies.<br>  <br>  As the hands become more sensitive, you can use them to detect the auric energies emanating from other parts of the body as well. These detections may feel like heat, pressure, tingling etc.Hold your dominant hand about a foot and a half above your bared forearm.<br>  <br>  Slowly lower your hand toward the forearm. Pay attention to anything that you might feel. How close do you come to the forearm before you can feel the energy from it? Remember that the feeling may be one of pressure, heat, coolness, thickness etc. It will feel much like what you experienced between you hands. It may not be as strong, but you should be able to feel it. If you cannot, slowly repeat it. Remember that you are reawakening your ability to consciously be aware of  the subtle energies around you.<br>  <br>  The Meaning of Colors<br>  <br>  Color can be constructive or destructive. It can stimulate or depress, repel or attract. It can even be male or female in its character. It can reflect positive or negative, and when perceived within the aura it provides a key to the personality, moods, maturity and health of the individual. It reflects physical  and spiritual aspects.<br>  <br>  It takes a great deal of practice to interpret the color shades seen within the aura. Each color has its general characteristic,but each shade of that color change that characteristic a little. The location of the color, the intensity and even the from the color takes in the auric field must be considered.<br>  <br>  This text is not intended to provide all of the subtle nuances of color interpretation within the auric field. You will examine basic colors and the energies they commonly indicate on physical and other levels. This gives you a starting point to begin to understand what is revealed by the colors of the aura.<br>  <br>  The colors closest to the body reflect aspects of the individual's physical condition. They also indicate those energies manifesting and energies further away often indicate the energy that the person will be able to determine time elements of certain energy patterns by the color and the location of the color with respect to the physical body.<br>  <br>  The Rainbow colors<br>  <br>  Red<br>  <br>  Red is the color of strong energy, fire and primal creative force. It is the life-promoting energy. It is hot. It can indicate strong passion, mind and will. It is a dynamic color that can reflect anger, love, hate and unexpected changes. It can indicate new birth and transmutation.<br>  <br>  It is a color that affects the circulatory system of the body, the reproductive system (sexual energy) and an awakening of latent abilities and talents.<br>  <br>  Too much red or a muddiness can reflect overstimulation, inflammation or imbalance. It may reflect nervousness, temper, aggression, impulsiveness or excitement.<br>  <br>  Orange<br>  <br>  Orange is the color of warmth, creativity and emotions. It is an indication of courage, joy and socialness. It is a color which can reflect an opening of new awareness-especially to the subtle realms (the astral plane) of life.<br>  <br>  Depending on the shade, it can also indicate emotional imbalances and agitation. Some of the muddier shades of orange can reflect pride and flamboyance. It may reflect worry and vanity.<br>  <br>  Yellow<br>  <br>  Yellow is one of the first and the easiest aura colors to be seen. Pale yellow around the hairline can indicate optimism. Yellow is the color of mental activity and new sunshine. It can reflect new learning opportunities, lightness, wisdom and intellect. The more pastel shades often reflect wisdom and intellect. The more pastel shades often reflect an enthusiasm for something (especially in the pale yellow to white spectrum). Yellow is a color which represents the power of ideas and awakening psychic abilities and clairsentience.<br>  <br>  Deeper and muddier shades of yellow can reflect excessive thinking and analyzing. It can reflect being overly critical, feeling of being deprived of recognition and being dogmatic.<br>  <br>  Green<br>  <br>  Green is the color of sensitivity and growing compassion. It reflects growth, sympathy and calm. It can reflect a person who is reliable, dependable and open-minded. Bright green moving toward the blue spectrum in the aura indicate healing ability. It is a color of abundance, strength and friendliness. <br>  <br>  The muddier or darker shades of green can reflect uncertainty and miserliness. The muddier shades often reflect jealousy and possessiveness as well. It can indicate self-doubt and mistrust.<br>  <br>  Blue<br>  <br>  Blue, next to yellow, is one of the easiest colors to see in the aura. It is the color of calm and quietness. It reflects aevotion, truth and seriousness. It can indicate the ability for clairaudience and for the development of telepathy.<br>  <br>  The lighter shades of blue reflect an active imagination and good intuition. The deeper shades of blue can indicate a sense of loneliness, which on one level reflects a life-long quest foe the Divine. The deeper shades of blue reflect levels of devotion. Royal blue shades indicate the person has found or is about to find his or her chosen work.<br>  <br>  The muddier shades of blue can reflect blocked perceptions. They can indicate melancholy, rushing and worrying, domineering, fearfulness, forgetfulness and oversensitivity.<br>  <br>  Violet and Purple<br>  <br>  Violet is the color of warmth and transmutation. It is the color for the blending of the heart and the mind, the physical with the spiritual. It reflects independence and intuition, as well as dynamic and important dream activity. It can reflect one who is searching. The purple shades often reflect an ability to handle affairs with practicality and worldliness. The paler and lighter shades of violet and purple can reflect humility and spirituality. The red-purple shades can indicate great passion strength of will. They may also reflect a need for greater individual effort.<br>  <br>  The darker and muddier shades can reflect a need to overcome something. They can also reflect intense erotic imaginations as well. Tendencies toward being overbearing, needing sympathy and feeling misunderstood are also reflected in muddier shades.<br>  <br>  Other Colors of the Aura<br>  <br>  Pink<br>  <br>  Pink is a color of compassion, love and purity. It can reflect joy and comfort and a strong sense of companionship. When seen in the aura, it can indicate the quiet, modest type of individual, along with a love of art and beauty.<br>  <br>  Depending on the shade of pink, it can also reflect an immaturity, especially the muddier shades. It can reflect  truthfulness or a lack of it. It can also reflect times of new love and new vision.<br>  <br>  Gold<br>  <br>  Gold is a color that reflects dynamic spiritual energy and a true coming into one's own power. It reflects the higher energies of devotion and great inspiration. It indicates a time of revitalizing.<br>  <br>  Muddier shades of gold can indicate the person is still in the process of awakening higher inspiration and has not clarified it yet within his/her life. It reflects the alchemical process still being active; i.e.' the person is still working to turn the lead of his/her life into gold.<br>  <br>  White<br>  <br>  White is often seen in the aura, prior to any actual colors. It is often seen as a diaphanous shades. White has all colors within it, and when it does appear strongly within the aura, it is often in conjunction with other  colors. This is how you can know whether it is an actual energy color or just a poor perception of the aura. When the white does stand out as a color in the aura, it reflects truth and purity. It indicates that the energy of the individual is cleansing and purifying itself. It often reflects an awakening of greater creativity as well. <br>  <br>  Gray<br>  <br>  Gray is a color of initiation. It can indicate a movement toward unveiling innate abilities. Those shades of gray that lean more toward the silver reflect an awakening of the feminine energies. Those are the energies and abilities of illumination, intuition and creative imagination.<br>  <br>  The darker shades of gray can indicate physical imbalances, especially if seen next to specific areas of the physical body. They can also indicate a need to leave no task undone. Much gray in the aura can indicate a person who is secretive and who is the lone wolf type.<br>  <br>  Brown<br>  <br>  Brown often appears in the auric field. Although many people think of as reflecting a lack of energy or an imbalance, this is not always so. Brown is the color of the earth. When it shown itself in the aura, especially in areas above the head and around the feel, it can reflect new growth. It indicates establishing new roots and a desire to accomplish. It is a color that can reflect industry and organization.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, brown across the face or touching the head may indicate a lack of and need for discrimination. It seen in the areas of the chakras, it can indicate that those centers need to be cleaned. It will reflect in such cases a clogging of their energies. Brown is often difficult to interpret, as it can easily reflect problem areas in the physical, but you must be careful about jumping to conclusions when you see it. Feedback from the other person is the best means of understanding it.<br>  <br>  Black<br>  <br>  Black is one of the most confusing of colors in the auric spectrum. I have heard individuals say that, when black shows up in the aura, it is  an indication of death or terrible disease. I have not found that to be true.<br>  <br>  Black is a color of protection. It is a color which can shield an individual from outside energies. When seen in the aura, it can reflect that the person is protecting himself or herself. It can also indicate that person has secrets. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as it is not taken to extremes. Black can also indicate that a new understanding of burdens and sacrifices is going to manifest. <br>  <br>  Black can also indicate imbalances. Physical imbalances often show up as black or darkened areas in the aura around the physical body. the location provides clues to this. In the outer edges of the aura, black can indicate holes in the auric field. I have seen this in the auras of those who were victims of child abuse and those who are or were strong substance abusers ( alcohol, drugs, tobacco etc.).<br>  <br>  Silver Twinklies<br>  <br>  Another aspect that I have observed should be mentioned. I have often seen within the aura what look to be soft, twinkling lights. They are usually very sparkly and silver in color. I have found that they indicate one of several things. These "twinklies'" as I call them, are almost always a sign of great creativity and fertility. When they appear within the auric field of a person, it indicates that greater creativity is being activated within the individual's life.<br>  <br>  Strengthening and Protecting the Aura<br>  <br>  TECHNIQUE # 1<br>  <br>   PREVENTING YOURSELF FROM BEING DRAINED<br>  <br>  We have all experienced being drained by an-other person. You may talk to him or her on the phone or in person, and, when you finish, you are exhausted. Your stomach may ache etc. What you are experiencing is an energy drain.<br>  <br>  Some individuals draw or suck off the energy of others. Most of the time this happens because the individuals involved do not realize it. In many cases they are using your energies to supplement their own rather than building up their own. All they may realize is that, when they finish talking with you or being with you, they feel better. This does not give them a right to take your energy, however, and you should not allow it.<br>  <br>  This does not mean that you should accuse this person of being a vampire or say that you will not speak to him or her again because he or she is sucking off your energy. If you do, this person will think you have gone off the deep end. In that case, your problem will be solved, because he or she will probably not care to see you after that. Most people still are not open to the subtle aspects of energy, and you must keep this in mind when dealing with them.<br>  <br>  It is easier just to correct the situation without saying a word about it. You can control whether another shares your energy or not. One of the simplest methods is to close your circuit of energy. There are currents of energy flowing through your body and around it within the auric field. You  can close them down so that your energies only circulate around your own auric field and throughout your body. You prevent your energies from being drawn off from the aura, and you prevent your aura from drawing in another's energy.<br>  <br>  Assuming the posture shown on the next page is all it takes. You cross your feet at the ankles and bring your thumbs and fingers together so they are touching. (If you wish, you can use just your thumbs and index fingers.) This close your circuit. Your energy will not go out from you.<br>  <br>  The next time you encounter your friend who drains you, assume this posture. Simply rest your hands casually on your lap, touch your fingers and cross your ankles. It is casual and simple, and no one will suspect you of anything. You can also do this when on the phone with such people.<br>  <br>  If you do this, you will get some feedback through other friends as to the effects. You may hear comments such as, "You are just not as nice,' "You are not as open as you has nothing to do with being mad at people. You will still be talking with them as nicely and as often as ever. What you are not doing is allowing them to take your energy! You simply are not allowing them to drain you. Because they are not getting "high" from you, they are assuming something is wrong. No one has the right to take your energy without your permission.<br>  <br>  TECHNIQUE # 2 <br>  <br>  ENERGY BREATHING TECHNIQUE<br>  <br>  Fresh air and proper breathing are essential to a strong and vital aura. Breathing for maximum energy to the aura should be done through the nostrils. Many people have a bad habit of mouth breathing, not realizing that nostril breathing is more natural and healthy.<br>  <br>  Mouth breathing makes an individual more susceptible to diseases. It impairs the vitality of the aura. It can even weaken the constitution. Between the mouth and the lungs, there is nothing to strain the air. Dust, dirt and other impure substances have a clear track to the lungs. Mouth breathing also admits cold air to the lungs, which can lead to inflammation of the respiratory organs.<br>  <br>  Nostril breathing, on the other hand, is more vitalizing and healthy to your entire energy system. The   nose provides specialized surfaces for the absorption of prana from the air.Prana can be likened to the vitalizing aspect that exists within air. Many  Eastern breathing techniques require a conscious focus upon the tip to the nose and the entire nasal area during inhalation. This enhances the prana absorption, raises the vitality of the entire aura and stimulates the entire energy system of the human being.<br>  <br>  The nostrils and the nasal passages are designed with hair to filter and sieve the air. They also warm the air through the mucous membranes. This makes the air fit for the delicate organs of the lungs, and breath is them more energizing and strengthening to your auric field.<br>  <br>  In yoga, the moon breath is termed the Ida and the sun breath is termed the Pingala. The balance of the two is Susumna. Your energy has polarity, positive and negative, male and female, sun and moon. This breathing technique quickly energizes the aura and balances the polarity of the body. It also enhances your ability to remember and assimilate information. It balances the hemispheres of the brain. It can be used before studies to shorten learning time.  It can also be used as a quick-me-up during the day.<br>  <br>  The basic technique is comprised of alternate breaths, breathing in one nostril and then breathing out the other. (Remember that conscious attention to the tip of the nose, especially during the in-breath, will magnify the effects of this technique.) The rhythm is aided by holding the nose with the thumb and fingers. <br>  <br>  1. Begin with your right thumb and fingers over your nose and exhale. Place your tonque against the roof of     your mouth behind your front teeth.<br>  <br>  2. Use your thumb and close your right nostril; then inhale through your left nostril for a slow count of four.<br>  <br>  3. Keeping your right nostril closed, clamp your fingers down over your left nostril, pinching your nose closed     between your thumb and fingers. Hold for a court of 16. (If you have never performed any concentrated     rhythmic breathing, the count of 16 may be too long for you. If this is the case, reduce it or count faster.     With practice, you will develop the ability to hold your breath for more extended periods. Try indhaling for a     exhaling for a count of three. Work to find the rhythm that is most effective for you and then build upon it.)<br>  <br>  4. Release your thumb, opening your right nostril. Keep your left nostril closed with your fingers. Exhale     slowly out through your right nostril for a count of eight.   <br>  <br>  5. Release your nose, raise your left hand up and, with your thumb, close off your left nostril. Inhale for a count     of four through your right nostril and then clamp your fingers closed on it. Hold for a count of 16.<br>  <br>  6. Release  your thumb and your left nostril. Keep your right nostril clamped with your fingers. Exhale for a slow     count of eight through your left nostril.<br>  <br>  7. Repeat four to five breaths, alternating each side. Breath in one nostril, hold and exhale out the other.     Reverse it and repeat the procedure. Do at least four to five breaths for each side for a quick pick-me-up.     This will saturate your entire body and aura with quick energy.<br>  <br>  TECHNIQUE # 3<br>  <br>  THE CLEANSING VORTEX<br>  <br>  This exercise is a visualization exercise for cleansing and purifying your entire auric field. It is an excellent exercise to perform at the end of a day, especially at those times when you have interacted with a great many people. It helps sweep out energy debris, preventing it from accumulating and creating imbalance within the auric field. It only takes about five minutes to be effective.<br>  <br>  1. Take a seated position and perform a progressive relaxation. Performing the breathing technique just     described is beneficial as a preparation for this exercise. You may want to use a simple prayer or mantra as     well. Remember that the exercise as presented here is a guideline, and you should learn to abapt it to your     own energies.  <br>  <br>  2. About 20 feet above you, in your mind's eye, visualize a small whirlwind of crystalline white fire beginning to     form. It looks like a small, visualize it so that it is large enough to encompass your entire auric field. The     small end of the funnel should be visualized as capable of entering through the crown of your head and     passing down the middle pillar of your body .<br>  <br>  3. This whirlwind of spiritual fire should be seen as rotating and spinning clockwise. As it touches your aura,     see it as sucking up and burning off all of the energy debris you have accumulated.<br>  <br>  4. See, fell and imagine it moving down, over and through your entire aura and body. Know that it is sweeping     your energy field clean of all the extraneous energies you have accumulated throughout the day.  <br>  <br>  5. As it moves through your body, allow this energy vortex to exit out through your feet down into the heart of the     earth itself. See the vortex as carrying this energy debris into the lower realms, where it is used to fertilize     and benefit the lower kingdoms of life upon and within the planet.

There are no material inebrieties found in the personality of God as is found in the material personalities. When one gives up the temporary material coverings of one's eternal spiritual personality, one can then know about the spiritual personality of God. Otherwise it will always be a mystery.<br>  <br>  Few excerpts from Introduction to, "Krishna,The Supreme Personality of Godhead", by A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acharya of ISKCON <br>  (International Society for Krishna Consciousness)<br>  <br>  In the Western countries, when someone sees the cover of a book like Krishna, he immediately asks, “Who is Krishna ? Who is the girl with Krishna ?” etc.<br>  <br>  The immediate answer is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How is that? Because He conforms in exact detail to descriptions of the Supreme Being, the Godhead. In other words, Krishna is the Godhead because He is all-attractive. Outside the principle of all-attraction, there is no meaning to the word “Godhead.” How is it one can be all-attractive? First of all, if one is very wealthy, if he has great riches, he becomes attractive to the people in general. Similarly, if someone is very powerful, he also becomes attractive, and if someone is very famous, he also becomes attractive, and if someone is very beautiful or wise or unattached to all kinds of possessions, he also becomes attractive. So from practical experience we can observe that one is attractive due to (1) wealth, (2) power, (3) fame, (4) beauty, (5) wisdom and (6) renunciation. One who is in possession of all six of these opulences at the same time, who possesses them to an unlimited degree, is understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These opulences of the Godhead are delineated by Parasara Muni, a great Vedic authority.

No tiene que ser grande ni costoso. Talvez un simple detalle que le demuestre a tu amigo(a) lo especial que es para tí.

Puede ser desde una tarjeta física dise?ada, elaborada por ti y personalizada, hasta algo más grande pero siempre poniendole tu toque personal.  Alguna vez recuerdo haber regalado un porta retrato hecho por mi que incluia una foto del recuerdo, donde los protagonistas eramos nosotros.  :))|`|I3zvcHkmaa	De preferencia algo que hicieras con tus propias manos, los amigos verdaderos no se dejan llevar por marcas o costos.

Siempre recordamos aquel día que nos encontramos por primera vez y es una linda y divertida anécdota, nos reímos mucho y la verdad que valió la pena conocernos.<br>  Para mi no esta nada mal, solo hay que tener precaución porque nunca se sabe pero también se puede conocer gente maravillosa de lo que no te arrepentirás !!!!<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|da68de4f3964b75191c3b3bc24e4c8d6aa	yo me case con alguien a quien conoci en el chat,jajajajjajaa!!!!!|`|99c718fe479e2a40796d5f895f0e5d0aaa	no creo q este mal, verte en un lugar publico es buena idea...<br>  pero reoq  lo mas importante es creer en vos, y que si sabes que lo conoces te quedes con eso, porque sino vas a estar paranoica toda la cita, y se te va a notar. es bueno hablar por telefono un par de veces antes tambien|`|3988179e4511b57d74c244f1c39a9f39aa	No es lo recomendable, pero hay veces que una relación por chat puede llegar a ser muy fuerte, y que las partes quieran verse.<br>  En ese caso, como dijeron todos, buscá un lugar público y asegurate que conocés bien, al menos por chat, a la persona. No te encuentres con alguien que conociste hace menos de 5 meses. Lo mejor es primero conocer bien a la persona por chat y luego ver qué onda es en persona.<br>  Saludos!|`|b878572a6feca612c4670669eef3df83aa	si, me parece bien, yo sali con dos chicos que conoci por chat, y como dicen todos encontrate en un lugar publico, te das mas tranquilidad a vos!<br>  Mucha suerte con eso!<br>  y disfruta tu cita! jaja<br>  beso|`|o1LvSs77aa	Aunque no es la forma más recomendable para conocer a alguien, puede haber sorpresas muy agradables...yo conocí a alguien hace cuatro a?os y medio, nos vimos por fin personalmente el a?o pasado y...el resto es historia :)|`|31a79805c9e8a5a26a5dcf22fca297dfaa	pues si se podria dar una buena relacion, solo que toma tus precausiones, y veanse en un lugar publico, porque al final de cuentas es un desconocido no sea que te encuentres con un psicopata jajaja, mejor toma precausiones.|`|a7943232ba6023469145222e90840bd5aa	si, pero debs tener musho cuidado y tener en cuenta todas esas precauciones que siempre nos dicen....  solo por si resulta no ser quien creias... pero por otro lado conozco una pareja ke se conocio por internt y orita viven felices y contentos con sus dos hijos, asi ke ,si, podrias intentar, igual y es algo pa toda la vida (amistad o noviazgo, whatever)|`|b118770cc6f960099116be1f32b70bc9aa	Está bien pero es peligroso, como dicen otro usuarios busca un sitio público para la cita.|`|cc0b1f3038024f1fee61a6fbfadceb28aa	muy arriesgado, es simplemente salir con un desonocido de quien nadie puede darte referencias, cuidado|`|dc9d89fc63aa0c97f95eea229ddf7dc3aa	No se si esta bien o mal, solo que es un tanto peligroso, avisale a alguien de tu confianza que vas a salir con esa persona por las dudas, y no se... quedá en llamarla a una hora determinada para decirle que todo esta bien... tené cuidado, hay muchos locos detrás del chat.

Mejor analiza a profundidad el por que lo hiciste. Todos algunas vez cometemos errores garrafales que pueden hacernos perder todo lo que queremos.

Piensas que has ofendido a dios. Olvidate de eso. Pero si crees que solo confesandolo a tu esposa seras "libre" pues haslo. Pero no lo hagas de forma directa, preparala primero. Sugiere por ejemplo "que haria ella si tu le fueras infiel"....<br>  En mi caso como humanista no me preocupa lo divino. Y si hiciera algo asi, no se lo contaria a mi mujer. Prefiero sufrir solo yo y no hacerle sufrir a ella y la familia. Hay cosas que nunca se cuentan y se llevan a la tumba. <br>  Considera bien todas las posibles reacciones de ella, el dolor psicologico que esto causaria en ella, en la famialia. Y si crees que podrian superarlo pues cuentaselo. Pero si no crees que ella podria superarlo y aun sientes la necesidad de contarselo, cuentaselo a tu pastor, cura, primero y pide que el te ayude con el tema. asi ella sentira un poco de presion a reaccionar de forma profesional al tema.|`|ac26c7373a4494094c7a598e5cbd818faa	Bueno amigo por ahora el perdón de tu esposa es el que necesitas, el de tu conciencia ya está atacándote.|`|c5f58770c9e26e17269b17dd2d7a916caa	Mira no te precoupes por que Dios perdona todo.........no lo confieses.............dejala en paz y no lo hagas mas, si confesas podrias desilusionarla muchisimo o lo que es peor darte cuenta que tu tambien eres un cornudo.......pero por lo general las mujeres nos confesamos esos regalos que nos damos de vez en cuandooooooooooooo..............solo confesate con el cura en la iglesia, ademas la iglesia catolica si te confesas te perdona, osea podes matar a alguien vas lo confesas, el cura te da el perdon en nombre de Dios y LISTO!|`|c999fb639626f06acda43c48d8eec545aa	Sencillamente hermano pida perdon al Senor y el Senor que es gande y misericordioso lo perdonara.<br>  Ese complejo de culpa tienes que dejarlo, aunque disfruto ese rato de placer sencillamente no caigas en la redes del diablo.

Solo DIOS perdona tus pecados...  Un cura o sacerdote es un hombre igual de pecador que nosotros...<br>  Si en algoi te puedo ayudar...  japuino1@yahoo.com.mx<br>  Recomendación.... Busca una congregación cristiana... No te vas a arrepentir...<br>  <br>  Saludos..|`|b2d4433558793059cdec7f262ca01c4caa	no entiendo porque es necesario tener el perdon de "dios"|`|c56145c9947acb0f08507672e9a1a0c2aa	Dios es el Dios del perdòn, si en realidad sientes arrepentimiento y propòsito de enmienda, confièsalo a un sacerdote y podràs obtener la absoluciòn. Si de corazòn ya le pediste perdòn al Se?or, cuenta con que ya estàs perdonado.<br>  <br>  El es el ser màs misericordioso.

1c291a17220c477f89804912581cdd3daa	A groupie is a person who is typically an ardent fan of, and seeks intimacy (most often physical, sometimes emotional) with, a famous person.<br>  <br>  The techniques used by groupies to get close to their targets vary almost as much as the groupies themselves. Certainly, female groupies can wear clothing that highlights their physical attributes — or remove clothing, for that matter. Sometimes their availability and dogged persistence at pursuing their lust object are enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  Female groupies in particular are known for a long-standing tradition of being available for sexual intercourse with celebrities, rock stars, professional athletes, politicians, and other public figures regardless of the fact that the objects of their obsession may already be married with children, or otherwise already in a committed relationship.<br>  <br>  While perhaps only a small number of groupies are truly promiscuous in that they are willing to trade sexual favors for attention (and often expensive gifts), the tradition of "rock and roll groupies" continues to the present day, contributing to the image of the rock-and-roll lifestyle as one where sex and drugs are readily available at any time.|`|57c3c9db696e37bb4b2b41e669b663c2aa	in rock band they sing and they come up with names for their groups and they sleep with their band|`|76a2abe8e583e9295d0577810103916baa	Groupies hang around the places that they know their favourite bands go.

6kw5vKQeaa	Primero que nada: no todo el mundo acepta todo lo que dice la academia, si no no habría innovación. Hay muchísimos lingüistas que proponen sus teorías que son contrarias o diferentes a las de la academia, está en cada persona y profesor elegir la que más razonable le parezca.<br>  Segundo: la lengua es la que dictaminó que existieran los verbos irregulares, no fue la academia la que los inventó. Las lenguas se imponen, y no hay academia o grupo de normas que puedan hacerla funcionar de un modo u otro, funcionan como quieren. Si se dice "sé" (con acento incluído) es porque con la evolución de la lengua, desde su orígenes a partir del latín, la gente utilizó ese verbo, y es la gente que habla la lengua la que conjuga los verbos como quiere, como se hace por tradición, porque es la manera en la que sabemos hablar. Quién sabe, tal vez en el futuro, con la evolución de la lengua lleguemos a decir "yo sabo" y a todos nos suene correcto, y todos entendamos lo que se quiso decir.|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	De la misma manera que seguimos festejando (por lo menos aquí en la Argentina), el día que llegó Colón a América como el Día de la Raza. ?La raza de quién? Qué teníamos antes de que nos conquistaran los espa?oles? No teníamos raza?. Me parece que con el tema del lengua, (hay que reconocerles a los espa?oles que gracias a su conquista heredamos uno de los idiomas más ricos del planeta) aún seguimos atados a sus designios. Pero no coincido con vos lo que decías de la lógica del ser humano, pues como todo sistema inventado por el hombre, es artificial, es una convención, por lo tanto no tiene una lógica natural, sino fabricada. Lo que es lógico en un sistema es que esté regido por reglas. Pero en lo que sí estoy de acuerdo es que no tenemos por qué seguir atados a los dictámenes de la Real Academia. Nos hemos independizado (por los menos de Espa?a - esto es discutible de todos modos-) entonces por qué no podemos tener nuestras propias reglas, nuestros propios regionalismos, y que éstos sean aceptados tan sólo por ser de uso cotidiano?|`|5abe8b936082606c3223feeb61b9c6b2aa	estoy de acuerdo con SOL, de otra manera nos espresariamos de lo mas estupido.|`|955b933f78856acfe6dcbeb97d4717fbaa	Viva la revolucion!!!!!!, abajo las vocales!!!!1, abajo los pronombres y los sustantivos !!!!!! mueran los acentos y la letra q    <br>  Viva la anarquia !!!!!!!1|`|AMgrRQRLaa	es para los espa?oles no para los conquistados de america.|`|da8067e4ed0a2646a79cb273efec97b4aa	Porque si cada quien hiciera lo que quisiera, crees que existiría una buena comunicación? sí así nos cuesta trabajo expresar correctamente lo que queremos, ahora sin ninguna regla viviriamos en un mundo de caos en donde cada quien haría lo que quisiera.<br>  <br>  Son reglas, el mundo se rige bajo ciertas reglas y eso nos permite tener un poco más de armonía.

En la nuestra, una vez que dejas de aportar entonces no sirves más, sos desechable, un estorbo. No generas divisas, entonces no vales nada.

Te falta el aire pues tensionas el pecho, dejas de respirar normalmente por la angustia, es posible que también te duela. Las ganas de vomitar también tienen que ver con la angustia, es casi un acto reflejo, cuando estamos nerviosos sentimos que nos duele el estómago o que se nos revuelve. El dolor emocional se siente en el cuerpo y vomitar o llorar es una forma de descarga. Si estás en una crisis de la que no puedes salir, entonces tal vez necesites ayuda profesional. Pero para la angustia y la tristeza  o accesos de ira desmedidos, no porque seas bulímica. La bulimia es un trastorno alimentario cuyo síntoma principal es el atracón de comida, seguidos luego de vómitos provocados, ya sea en forma espontánea por el exceso de alimentos ingeridos, o en forma voluntaria manualmente. Por lo general la bulimia está acompa?ada por anorexia nerviosa. Pero el problema tanto del bulímico como el del anórexico es con la imagen distorsionada del cuerpo que esas personas tienen, desean verse diferentes rechazan el propio cuerpo, se ven gordas aunque estén extremadamente delgadas. De todos modos el trastorno de base es psicológico y no físico. Es la mente la que se enferma y luego se enferma el organismo.

He was also extremely self-centered, so once there, he did what he wanted.  After Hector killed his friend/lover, he was completely anti-Trojan.  The movie leaves out/changes quite a bit, so reading the Iliad is the best thing to understand the characters' motivations, but, in my opinion, Brad Pitt did a great job fleshing out a very two dimensional character, and Achilles in the movie Troy was very interesting and well done.|`|asuxXSoUaa	Achilles hated agamemnon, but he was bound by the pact that he made, to fight agains any person who threatened the marriage of Helen. He refused to lead his Myrmidons into battle, and was about to leave the battle field as the Greeks were being driven back to their ships, but his friend Patroclus stole his armor and rallied the Greeks, and they pushed back the Trojan forces. But before they could lay seige to the city, hector killed Patroclus, and revealed his true identity. Achilles, when finding out about this, rejoined the fight, only for revenge over his "friend" Patroclus|`|lTezdQgRaa	Agamemnon was still his general, the only reason he continued to fight was because Hector killed his best friend. Also dont pay attention to the movie. They are so dramatic and you should just read the play. It is much better I know.

This might be one of those instances.  You're such good friends - able to share everything.  That's rare in a bf/gf relationship.  If you're lucky it will develop the longer you're together.  So, it is totally understandable why you're drawn to him.  This is the perfect relationship - a depth of understanding, friendship, no sexual pressure, no judgement on any level !!!  Everyone of us would like the guy we know to have some of those characteristics.  Now, you feel drawn to him.  Who wouldn't.  He's a gem.<br>  So discuss it with him.  You might learn what things you desire in a bf.  Your friendship might even be better when you get this off of your mind.  Tell him.  He'll understand....he's probably just as confused as you are about who and what he wants.|`|ADxypFTGaa	Alright, so i am a gay guy and i have been in this situation before.

vMf7pL9Aaa	"Ask, and it shall be given you:  seek, and you shall find:  knock, and it shall be opened to you.  For every one that asketh, receiveth:  and he that seeketh, findeth:  and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.  Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?  Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?  If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children:  how much more will your Father who is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask Him?"   (Matthew 7:7-11)     To whom should you pray?       1. To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.     2. You may also pray to the Blessed Virgin, the Angels and the Saints.        "And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel."    (Apocalypse 8:4).    Why may you pray to the Blessed Virgin (Mary, Mother of God), the Angels and the Saints?        Because they are God's best friends; God will listen to them more than to us who are still sinners.        "Go to my servant Job, and offer yourselves a holocaust:  and my servant Job shall pray for you:  his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you:  for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath."    (Job 42:8)    Does everyone have a guardian angel?        Yes, God appoints an angel to watch over every human being.        "See that you despise not one of these little ones:  For I say to you, that their angels in Heaven always see the face of My Father Who is in Heaven."    (Matthew 18:10)    What does your guardian angel do for you?        Your angel prays for you, protects you from evil and inspires you to do good.        "Behold I will send My angel, who shall go before thee, and keep thee in thy journey, and bring thee into the place that I have prepared.  Take notice of him, and hear his voice."    (Exodus 23:20-21)    How does the devil act towards human beings?        The devil tempts people to commit sin.        "Watch out, because the devil goes about seeking whom he may devour.  You must resist him, being strong in Faith and knowing that he persecutes everyone else in the world, too."    (1 Peter 5:8-9)     How can you fight the devil?        The best weapons against the devil are prayer (especially calling on Jesus and Mary), holy water, blessed medals, scapulars and other blessed objects.        "Put you on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.  For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in high places."    (Ephesians 6:11-12)    Your guardian angel is a real person, who is always with you to help and protect you.  Pray to him often and thank him for his help.  Your guardian angel is an indication of how much God loves and cares for you.    The devil has succeeded in getting a large number of people to think that he is not real.  His is a real person and is a real danger to you personally.     Not all of your temptations come from the devil.  Others come from your own flesh ("concupiscence") and from the world about you -- traditionally stated, "from the world, the flesh, and the devil."      LOL.  Just goes to show that most Protestants believe in there private interpretation, as if God is supposed to conform to them, tater is a perfect example.  All we can do is pray for them.|`|AA10747877	Because they don't believe God will listen to them. They believe like JMR said, the saints in heaven are God's best friends and he will listen to them more than the catholics on earth because they are sinners.     True Christians are not called sinners by God in scripture, but are called saints. The apostle Paul addressed his epistles to the saints, not the sinners. True Christians have direct access to God and God tells us to come boldly before the throne of Grace, not ask some saint in heaven to do it for us. None of the apostles, and none of the Old Testament saints ever did what the catholics do because they would never insult God and dishonor Him like that. It is a form of idolatry and God hates it.   What kind of relationship would it be if the child has to go through a third party in order to reach the father because the child thinks the father cares more about the kids living in the same household with him than the one living at a distance. I'm sure that would grieve that father's heart.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	Last time I checked, the Bible served to convey religious truth. It is not a personal rulebook.    A note: Prayer is absolutely different from worship. Yes, we DO pray to Mary & Saints (well, we actually as THEM to pray for us), but we do NOT worship them. We are asking them to pray to God for our needs, just like you might ask your friend or fellow congregation member to pray for your's. Only difference is that your friend is here on earth, so you communicate to him/her through speech. The Saints are in heaven, so we communicate to them through prayer.    Worship is NOT about the physical manifestations exhibited during the process - it is about one's mindset over who is being worshiped. If we are mentally venerating Mary & Saints, than we are doing just that.     I can't make the following point any more prominent: Catholics do not worship anyone or anything else other than the One True God that exists in the form of the Holy Trinity. While we certainly do give much honor to Mary and the Saints, this is not to be confused with worship.     To clear up this misconception, consider this scenario: What do you do during the National Anthem? All Americans are encouraged to stand, facing the flag, remove their hats, put their hand to their heart, and recite the words as they are sung. However, this certainly isn't worship, is it? You are simply giving honor to your country, and the thousands upon thousands of troops who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their descendants.     This is pretty much the same thing that Catholics to with the Saints and Mary. We do not worship them, as they are not a god, but we do give them the honor they deserve for the great lengths they took for their beliefs and the betterment and promotion of their faith. Many of the Saints took the ultimate sacrifice, their lives, to keep their Catholic Christian beliefs true in their hearts. Certainly, the least we can repay them with is honor.|`|41e9b934c05e68ba59a55ceaf2c05787aa	They have forgotten his name, so they are too scared to pray to him.    And seeing as he told them in Matt 6:7 not to repeat their prayers over and over again they have to say them over and over again to someone else.|`|E71jweytaa	well friend  your first mistake is thinking we pray to them. correct that one and we will continue the discussion later|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	In the Bible it says (1) That Christians ask other Christian to pray for them, and (2) That those who follow Christ "will never die".  Therefore, if we ask other Christians to pray for us while they are still earthly sinners, there is no reason to stop asking them to pray for us once they are before the throne of God.  That is why Christians have asked the saints for intercession since day one.  It's really a shame that unauthorized manmade churches have rejected this fundamental Christian practice along with so many other Christian beliefs and practices, during the past few hundred years.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	It doesn't say to use the computer in the Bible either, or drive a car...    We pray for the intercession of the Saints because they are still part of the Body of Christ, and we believe in the communion of Saints.|`|AA10034051	The Bible directs us to invoke those in heaven and ask them to pray with us.    Thus in Psalm 103, we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:20-21). And in Psalm 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!" (Ps. 148:1-2)    Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In Revelation, John sees that "the twenty-four elders [the leaders of the people of God in heaven] fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints" (Rev. 5:8). Thus the saints in heaven offer to God the prayers of the saints on earth.    Angels do the same thing: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar [in heaven] with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3-4).    Jesus himself warned us not to mess with small children because their guardian angels have guaranteed intercessory access to the Father: "See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven." (Matt. 18:10).    Because he is the only God-man, Jesus is the only Mediator between man and God (1 Tim. 2:5), but this in no way means we cannot or should not ask our fellow Christians to pray with us and for us (1 Tim. 2:1-4), including those Christians in heaven, who have already had their sanctification completed, for "[t]he prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects" (Jas. 5:16).|`|NznqjqtPaa	Check out this site:  http://www.blognow.com.au/radicalview|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Because they are all in the Presence of Almighty God & have a far Greater Access to Him than we do here on earth.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	Good point, but I'm not sure why they do that.

AA12193600	no, when you do so you basically are saying either I'm not capable of deciding what I should watch and what I shouldn't watch and need to give that right to decide to someone else, or you are saying you should have the right to determine what someone else will watch or read.  In my own case I am perfectly intelligent enough to decide what I wish to watch or not watch--and I have no desire to control another adult.  To be sure there needs to be laws in place that eliminate  acess to such materials to youngsters, laws should be in place to prohibit distribution in culturally sensitive areas (next door to church, shcool, library etc).  Personally I don't believe in the concept of censorship.|`|ZWUXacATaa	Yes  Its disgusting...I dont want men looking at a computer screen getting personal satisfaction. Little kids might look at that...And for those who say I have a life and like porn...well you dont or you wouldnt be looking at that! Nasty people...|`|Q82K0pQFaa	Nope, and I'll tell you why.  It does not matter whether it is or isn't legal or illegal in the eyes of man to partake of pornography.  According to the righteous law of Jesus Christ, it will always be illegal.  Not one True Believer in Christ can call themselves a True Believer and engage in such disgusting idolatry.  God bless everyone!|`|AA11923447	Absolutely not. I am a Christian, and am also a staunch anti-censorship advocate. If you don't like porn, then don't buy it. Banning it (or anything else) is not the answer.|`|AA11192358	No, this is the United States, where we have a separation of church and state, so that if you have a moral and religious objection to the sex industry, you should move to a theocracy|`|M4WIWMgBaa	No. I like porn.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	NO!

They are not hurting anyone else, whether we agree with their decision or not.  As an adult, I don't want someone regulating what I can watch or read, and I'm not willing to do it to anyone else.

No. Never!    I see no reason why on earth anyone would want to do that.    If flamethrowers are legal, then porn should be as well. They're all consenting adults, and many of them are not only happy with their jobs (are you happy with your job?), but are also going to college as well. (Are you going to college?)      Those who regard a freedom from the chains of either religion  or the false moralities of sex as debauched are doing naught   but corrupting their minds with foolishness.      So cast ignorance into the hells of creed and learn of the   world with me.

Technically, it is Hebrew mythology, but it is interesting nonetheless.  According to the tradition, Lilith was Adam's first wife, also made from dust by God.  Adam tried to dominate her, but she was having none of that.  Adam complained, God made Eve from his rib to make her subservient to Adam.    The interesting thing about Lilith is how she manifests herself in all her "descendants" throughout the mythologies of many Mesopotamian cultures.    Or else consider how the Greek and/or Roman gods represent human characteristics.  While Ares was the god of war, so was Athena.  He was all about the bloodshed, violence and animalistic rage.  She was about cunning, strategy, basically the Greek word "metis" (not the god, the trait).
AA11609168	I confess them to the lord      that catholic stuff is a little too much for me....I mean where does the priest get off acting like he has ANYTHING to do with God forgiving my sins|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	CJ is right; our sins are confessed only to GOD, in a priest's presence.  Having a priest present, who is sworn to confidentiality, is helpful.  He can give help & direction to help us discern problems.  He can pronounce the audible words of GOD's willingness to forgive.|`|r8rykCkGaa	It is hard to confess knowing they will judge you because they didn't make the same mistake.  It's funny how quick people are to judge even though they make many mistakes I don't make, they overlook those and are just waiting for a chance to put condemnation on me.  Some people among my relatives are like this.  I asked a Bible study leader about that verse and she said, just be careful who you talk to----so I leave it at that.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	What good would it do?|`|1fB2UdRHaa	Why are you passing judgment?|`|DgmlkNsIaa	The confessor is not the issue, you confess your sins to God, the confessor is just the instrument  God  uses|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	All sin is an offense to God and to the faith community.  If your father is convicted of drunk driving, it effects you as well as your father.  In the same way, when one of us sins, it effects all of the faith community.    Confession to a priest is done in order to be reconciled to God and the faith community.  The priest is the instrument by which God forgives sins and a representative of the faith community.    There are many examples in the Bible in which God uses sinful men to accomplish His will.  The man who brought the Israelites out of captivity was not a holy and righteous man, but a king who wiorshipped false idols.    The effacacy of a sacrament does not depend on the holiness of the priest but on the Holy Spirit who is acting through the priest.|`|TsBSLY9taa	I think that verse should be changed to the way that the Christian churches use it:    Confess your faults one to another so they can be used against you at a later time.    That's what my experience was when I was a messianic for over 20 years in the Christian church {yes Messianics are Christians}, and I've seen first hand how that verse has been used to rip lives apart.    I'd rather people confess their faults only to God then to others, much safer that way.|`|jVPd8kJMaa	The key to understand "confessing your sins to one another" is to use "humility".    Humility says, " I am in the fight together, and I belong to the body of Christ". Therefore, I can rely on other members of the church of the Lord to pray on behalf of my sins.    Now, people think sins are only immorality, homosexuality, perversion, killing, stealing etc...Sins can also be arrogance, not being humble enough to ask for help from another brother. In fact, you can trace all sins from one simple word, the opposite of humility: Pride. Pride is the summary of all the evils, sins, killing that you can see in the universe.    Name me at least one single sin without pride? The bible says, "Christ was humble", but satan was prideful from the beginning.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	Good question. All they want to do is get you drunk ("Blood of Christ") and do bad things to little kids ("Blow on Gabriel's trumpet, my son"). Micheal Jackson would have made an excellent priest.|`|gkuwNtsvaa	If you are referring to a priest/minister in his capacity to hear confessions/grant absolution, this is a sacrament that many Christians believe was conferred on the apostles by Christ and transmitted through ordination/laying on of hands via bishops down through the ages.   Read the gospel of St. John 20:23, Jesus breathed on His disciples and said to them,  "Receive the Holy Spirit.  If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven;  if you withhold forgiveness (absolution) from them, they are not forgiven."    All of this is tied up with the tradition of the Christian Church, as many believers hold that St. Peter was made the Chief Apostle.  Read St. Matt. 16:18,  "You are Peter and upon you whose name means rock (cephas) I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."    And further, Jesus states, " Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven."  What does that mean? That whatever is prohibited by the Bishops is prohibited in heaven and whatever is made lawful in religious affairs  is lawful in heaven."      Big controversy on all this.  The protestant reformation came about because of abuses in this area of forgiveness of sins and the granting of indulgences, which were specific get out of jail cards for sins.  Must tread lightly on this.  Keywords:  Apostolic Succession, Sacraments.    I noticed some of the answers that had already been posted and it caused me to add this:  Come on, don't bash all of the priests, they are not all child molesters or bad pastors.  There are some very holy priests and ministers.  You cannot judge all of a group simply because of the degeneracy of some.|`|8hoi0xVqaa	that is truely catholic u dont have to confess ur sins to anyone besides God. no priest can forgive u of ur sins or save u from eternal wrath.....bring on the thumbs down|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Is it considered rude to ask the priest if he's a child molester before you confess?

8yaYafBAaa	Scientists Comments on the Scientific Miracles in the Holy Quran:     The following are some comments of scientists1 on the scientific miracles in the Holy Quran.         1)  Dr. T. V. N. Persaud is Professor of Anatomy, Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy for 16 years.  He is well-known in his field.  He is the author or editor of 22 textbooks and has published over 181 scientific papers.  In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  When he was asked about the scientific miracles in the Quran which he has researched, he stated the following:     The way it was explained to me is that Muhammad was a very ordinary man.  He could not read, didnt know [how] to write. In fact, he was an illiterate.  And were talking about twelve [actually about fourteen] hundred years ago.  You have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature.  And I personally cant see how this could be a mere chance.  There are too many accuracies and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.      Professor Persaud has included some Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  in some of his books.  He has also presented these verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  at several conferences.     2)  Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.  Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  He was also the President of the American Fertility Society.  He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992.  Professor Simpson studied the following two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad :     {In every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mothers womb by forty days...}2     {If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....}3     He studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis.  He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad .  Then, during one conference, he gave the following opinion:     So that the two hadeeths (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad ) that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days.  Again, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this morning: these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . . It follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches, that there exist statements in the Quran shown centuries later to be valid, which support knowledge in the Quran having been derived from God.      3)  Dr. E. Marshall Johnson is Professor Emeritus of Anatomy and Developmental Biology at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.  There, for 22 years he was Professor of Anatomy, the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy, and the Director of the Daniel Baugh Institute.  He was also the President of the Teratology Society.  He has authored more than 200 publications.  In 1981, during the Seventh Medical Conference in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, Professor Johnson said in the presentation of his research paper:     Summary: The Quran describes not only the development of external form, but emphasizes also the internal stages, the stages inside the embryo, of its creation and development, emphasizing major events recognized by contemporary science.      Also he said: As a scientist, I can only deal with things which I can specifically see.  I can understand embryology and developmental biology.  I can understand the words that are translated to me from the Quran.  As I gave the example before, if I were to transpose myself into that era, knowing what I knew today and describing things, I could not describe the things which were described.  I see no evidence for the fact to refute the concept that this individual, Muhammad, had to be developing this information from som|`|E0lMycUeaa	yes they are practicing muslims and we follow the news of people like him ,yusuf estes ,bilal Philips ,.....and many others in    http://www.youtubeislam.com/    by the way there is scientists every day confirm the Quran and be muslims just press the above link and type scientists    second  i think instead of doubting previous Muslims scientists whom by no means could know what we know now why not following the Quran advice to ask those who knows? why not going to a language specialist and ask him whether this is in Quran or not    finally  as for the sun i think the below verse will answer     017.044  The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [ Allah ] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.    at end    003.007  It is He who has sent down to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah . But those firm in knowledge say, "We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord." And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.      deer the verse you ask about is talking about how the sun praise GOD .    BR  basem
stAeoUeSaa	Azazel and the 200 watchers (or Igigi) sent to Mount Hermon (also called Sion), that fell madly in lust for fair human women in the days of Jared. This is told of in Genesis 6:2-9; the books of Enoch; the book of Jasher; and the book of Jubilees. Enoch says they appeared almost like 'white men' of various size. Their offspring were the Nephilim (Titans or giants). Azazel mainly but also with his friends taught their new wives and enormous offspring sorcery, astrology, weather, and lots of very highly classified information from Heaven (like merkabahs, mind control spells,etc). Think of it a minute. A pure antediluvian race from Adam living up to 300-900 years old each(Genesis 5) just learning how their world around them worked, but on top of that the watchers gave their Titanic children enough technology and power to control the entire original supercontinent called Pangaea. In fact, they did. This combination had in almost no time created a Golden Age (for the Aristocrats and a nightmare for the lower class) - a mixture of technology and spirituality this planet hasn't seen again to this day. They built the crystal skulls, Stonehenge, and all the pyramids from South America through Bosnia to China. The watchers were punished immediately as told of in 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6, and the books of Enoch. The devouring Nephilims and others were destroyed later in the Great Flood where they tried to climb mountains and hover over the water until the merkabahs (actually a bit less glorious version called a Vimana) eventually crashed into the sea.     But it was said some found safe refuge in a secret place of the Earth. This is how some of the giant line still survived down to men like the sons of Anak (Annunaki), the Rephaim, Zuzummim, Goliath from Gath, and King Og of Bashan not to mention some of the technology that wasn't lost for good (supposely) until tyrant King Nimrod (Sargon or Enmerkar) rebelled with his Tower of Babel in Eridu. It was going to be so high he boasted no flood would ever reach him and their heavenly wonder-toys again. Needless to say, God destroyed the Tower, confused all speech, divided Pangea, and scattered all the people in the time of Peleg whose name meant "divided". So bye! bye! Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu, and Ultima Thule (Hyperborea).     Now a few millennia later come the Nazis with their "knowledge"of their white Aryan ancestry. Using the occult black arts to conjure demons, their father satan, and using the gorgeous but evil withces of the Vril Society as mediums to contact the imprisoned watchers to find out where the antediluvian technology was hidden... Tibet? Tunnels in the Andes?? Bolivia??? Even a strange void in Anarctica?!?! So the Nazis built Base 211 down there. America had Admiral Byrd fly to the North Pole and sure enough he found Job's 'empty place' in the North (Job 26:7) and their own stash of antediluvian goods.     The Germans engineered the Nazi Bell prototype, then a real vimana- the Haunebu model, followed by another- the Vril model. They were seen during WW2 and were called foo fighters or wonderweapons. At the end of the war, America formed Operation Paperclip and tried to get as many of the German scientists and occultists before the Soviets could. They then sent Phil Schnieder and the boys behind the 'green door' to dig up the watchers from gloomy Tartarus just like the prophet foresaw (Amos 9:2) followed by digging DUMBs (deep underground military bases) to carry on experiments with the rediscovered hightech artifacts with watcher help of course. After being toasted, they now appear as tall grays, short grays, and orangish grays that all wreak of sulfur! They have retroengineered all kinds of unimaginable weapons using the antediluvian HAARP technology, Tesla rays, zero point energy, and the latest vimana called the TR-3B that uses mercury plasma magnetic vortex propusion just like the vimanas used in the great massacre of the ******* Harappan and Mohjen-Daro people (of the sons of Joktan and Raamah or Lord Rama) of the early Indus river civilization by the Aryans told of in the Rig Veda. The same Vedas that J.Oppenheimer quoted Shiva as saying, "I am become death." More specific details of vimana schematics can be found in the Vaimanika Shastra.     America built Thule Air Base right on top of the ruins of Thule and Ultima Thule. The Illuminati are waiting anytime between now and July(ever wonder why Bill Clinton's favorite movie was Independence Day?) to do a pretend fallen 'alien' invasion with holographic augmentation to bring in the New World Order and the so called 'Noahdic' one world religion as told of in 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12. Only Jesus can save you off this prison planet now, and only He can if you are saved, repented, and never taken the implant(Verichip/Xmark), electronic tattoo(Somark), nor any 'Mark' told of in Revelation 13:16-18. Now you see that when Jesus said, "as the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the Son of man"; He meant EXACTLY like it, well we may be a little behind. We are living in amazing times my friends. Read Obadiah 4 to see if the Illuminati even have a shot at pulling all this off. Unfortunately, they have recreated some HUGE Nephilim via the 'alien abduction' ruse. May we all pray in agreement together that we are all found worthy enough to be spared by a pre-Trib natzal ('gathering up' or rapture). For it is here even at the door.    Watchers- 'fathers from the sky' + human 'mothers from earth' = Nephilim  Mythologized by the Danaans as:  Ouranus(father sky) + Gaea(mother earth) = Titans  *The Danaans are Doric descendants of the Tribe of Dan that became the Lacedaemonians in turn the ancestors of the Spartans. Another example would be the Danite- Samson -being mythologized into Herakles.*    Here is NASA footage of a 'vimanas/SDS vs. Merkabah' fight from not too long ago:  |`|4TX26viFaa	Half angel.

You can pray to Him throughout the day as you feel a need to, for yourself and others. People at church can pray for you too, if you ask them.

Christians don`t moke the rules. We just read the Bible and try to follow the guidlines written in there.  God made the Earth which as far as we know is the only place within and without the Universe where God does not have full dominion. this he gave to beings made in his image Human Kind. We are in fact spiritual baings living in an Earthly shell/tent and were put in charge of the Earth in partnership with God.  When Adam and Eve obeyed the Devil (who is also a created spritual being but not with and earthly shell) and disobeyed God, he effectively broke our contract with God and made new one with The Devil. This is still the situation.situation The Devil is now in control of the Earth and all human beings belong to him unless they make a decision otherwise.  You already know that Jesus died so the EVERYONE can be free from this evil contract. ALL the anyone has to do to be free is to recognise this and agree with God. nothing else. God will do the rest.  I would love to say that there are opt out clauses for some people like pretty litle ones or ones who can`t understand. It reduces me to tears to think that it could be otherwise.  Evil dictators don`t make expeptions when they practice genocide. They destroy all and everything no mercy, no compassion.  In my book the Devil is much worse than any human being could ever be or could even imagine.  You make your own mind up about this. I have spent much of my life dedicated to working with the people you ask about. I reckon that if I try to make their life on Earth as good as possible. I`ts up to God what happens when they (and Me) leave Earth.
zPfgFXU5aa	For almost 300 years those people and their descendants and relatives did play a leading role in the church but that all changed In the year 318AD when  the Bishop of Rome, Sylvester, with the backing of the the Emperor Constantine and the might of the Roman Empire, broke with tradition and appointed Greek Bishops to run the historic original Apostolic churches of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus and Alexandria AND he made Rome the "Mother Church" whom all the others had to follow.    Prior to this Christians of Jewish origin (and often relatives of Jesus) headed those important churches in the East and Bishops of Gentile origin headed the Churches in the West.    The Church in Jerusalem was the original Mother Church to whom all the other churches looked to for guidance and it was church tradition that the Bishop of Jerusalem was to be a relative of Jesus. For example, James the brother of Jesus was the first Bishop of Jerusalem and all the other Apostles and Bishops always sought James's advice on church and spiritual matters.    When James was martyred, Jesus' cousin Symeon was appointed Bishop of Jerusalem and head of the Mother Church and we he was martyred one of Judas' sons was elected Bishop (not Judas Iscariot, but Jesus Brother who was also called Judas) and so on until 300 years later Constantine and Sylvester broke this tradition.    It would seem that other Uncles, brothers, cousins and nephews of Jesus also held various positions in the Jewish branches of the church in the Holy land.    There is a record of a delegation of these relatives of Jesus visiting Sylvester and trying to reason with him and get him to  change his mind about appointing Rome the New Mother church and also to get him to cancel the appointment of Greek Bishops in the East and follow the Apostolic tradition of having relatives of Jesus lead the churches there.    But as Rome had conquered all these countries and ran their governments, Sylvester could see no reason why Rome shouldn't also run the Church as well and Constantine was keen to have a single universal religion that the whole Empire could follow, so Constantine backed Sylvester up and the true heirs to the Eastern Churches were sent packing and disappeared into history, Some think they went into hiding for fear that the Roman Catholic church would hunt them down and kill them just as the she had done to other Christians that refused to bow down to her. Eventualy after 2 - 3 generations of  hiding their identiy the relatives of Jesus, Joseph, Mary etc lost all knowledge of who they were.|`|AA11297267	There was no "catholic church" or any other such well-defined organization when the apostles were supposedly alive.    Early christians met in very informal groups.  It wasn't until well into the 2nd century that there was any sort of organization, and then it wasn't at all formal and had no central authority.  The idea of one big "church" that contained all of christianity didn't come into play until Constantine -- and even then it didn't last long, as the eastern churches refused to agree to what they considered Nicean "heresies."    So there was no organization or authority to tell people to keep track of records.  Some stuff some people thought was important was written down, other things weren't.  It's really that simple.  Either nobody wrote down what you're looking for, or it was written down but later lost or intentionally destroyed.    Peace.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Assuming that any of the Apostles had children, apparently God didn't consider it important enough to inspire any of the apostles to write it down.

Uma coisa que muito me entristece é constatar que verdades n?o s?o ditas por esses, pois os colocaria em dificuldade perante seus fiéis. Por exêmplo: NENHUMA PROFECIA DA ESCRITURA é DE PARTICULAR INTERPRETA??O.

Coisa do tipo "ah, vou fazer birra, dizer que n?o sou filho de deus", mas n?o é. Está no cerne da sua quest?o. Explico:<br>  Quando você fala em uni?o em torno das semelhan?as, você inconscientemente pensa nas semelhan?as "mais semelhantes" às suas. Você mesmo fala "somos filhos de deus". Ocorre que nem toda religi?o tem esta concep??o. Onde ficariam os hindús, os budistas ou os xintoístas nesta história? Hindus e xintoístas tem vários deuses, os budistas n?o tem a mesma concep??o de "deus" que as religi?es monoteístas.<br>  Você fala "ele nos aben?oaria mais por isso do que se ficarmos brigando por causa dele", mas esta é sua concep??o de deus. Você conseguiria, para encontrar a uni?o, abrir m?o da concep??o de um deus que aben?oa ou deixa de aben?oar alguém por alguma coisa que a pessoa fa?a ou deixe de fazer? Ou abandonar a concep??o de um deus que esteja ao menos observando o que você faz ou deixa de fazer?<br>  N?o estou criticando sua vontade de que haja maior uni?o, só estou chamando a aten??o para o fato de que, ao se falar nisso, muitas vezes esquecemos que o assunto é muito mais complexo do que parece. N?o é uma quest?o de todos acreditarem em um deus mas discordarem da cor de sua roupa. é uma quest?o de existirem diversas cren?as em diversos deuses que s?o incompatíveis entre si, e é justamente isso que causa toda esta divis?o.<br>  A separa??o dos homens em grupos talvez nem seja o problema. Talvez o problema seja a intolerancia de um grupo em rela??o ao outro.<br>  Bom, é isso, só quis comentar, sem qualquer inten??o de desfazer da sua pergunta.|`|G0ffhLmEaa	Luiz... a internet traz justamente a possibilidade das pessoas se mostrarem como realmente s?o. Essas "agress?es" ocorrem porque quem agride escondido atrás de um avatar, se sente muito seguro para fazê-lo. Eu acredito que quase ninguém tem a coragem de se manifestar dessa forma na vida real. Daí a separa??o. As pessoas, na grande maioria, n?o est?o preparadas para conviver com as diferen?as.<br>  <br>  E quanto a todos serem filhos de deus, apenas os crist?os, ok? <br>  <br>  Abra?os e sejam felizes!!!|`|bB5KbAuWaa	"vírgula" - eu n?o sou filho de Deus
xopIi2Vfaa	Of course. Thoughout history there have been unjust laws which usually were meant to serve a dictatorship or a tyranny. If a law asks you to kill somebody or to turn somebody in for a trivial offense (such as talking in a uncomplimentary way about the government) you will know that that's not a good law. Not turning people in and not killing them because they e.g. like to dye their hair purple is not a crime, regardless what your government might be thinking.

These poor animals were beat, neglected and most went without food or shelter in all sorts of weather (Vermont)      One summer when I was 20 and I had my own place, They decided to breed yet another dog and all the puppies were cute lil mutts but were soon "No fun" to take care of anymore so they too were left outside with no food, water or any kind of attention. Skin and bones really.  I begged the man to give me the dogs and even offered him money for them all. He wouldn't budge.     One weekend I hopped by my in laws and noticed no one was home at the neighbors and saw one puppy inside a very small chicken wired cage in the middle of the lawn with no food, water and obviously not adequate shelter.  I took him, I couldn't stand it anymore.. I was going insane looking at these poor animals and with the authorities not doing anything but fining these people I had to take him.

Even though I do not agree with popular views on the return of Christ, I do believe and know that he will return.  The most important thing you can do to be ready for Christ's return is to be a light to the world.  Be the example Jesus was telling others on the sermon on the mount.  Matthew 7:15-20.  Jesus also told his disciples that by their deeds the world would know them.  Love the Lord God Jesus Christ with all you heart.  Keep his commandments.  Most importantly we must love others as this is the great commandment from the Lord Jesus Christ.  You may say what does this have to do with the imminence of Christ's return?  Everything.

That's when Russia and the Muslim world invade Israel. The Muslims will not follow Russia's lead until they are assured of Russia's superiority. And ... they cannot invade Israel until the USA is out of the picture. The rapture must occur just prior to these events.<br>  <br>  Right now Israel is preparing for an invasion by her Arab neighbors and she's preparing to destroy Iran's nuke facilities with the help of the USA.<br>  <br>  The USA has two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Persian Gulf. Another is on the way there. A fourth is being seriously considered as a back up in the Arabian Sea. That's half our entire Navy.<br>  <br>  The Russians have mastered something called scalar technology (as have the Israelis) that can sink our entire navy in an instant, not to mention Sunburn supersonic anti-ship missiles for which we have no defense. We're sitting ducks. All this could happen as early as the end of this month.<br>  <br>  With no US Navy in the way, the Russians and Muslims are free to invade Israel fulfilling the prophesy of Ezekiel 38,39, leading to the seven year tribulation period. But before all that, the rapture.<br>  <br>  Dreamstuff Entity – you are sadly mistaken. In the first century Jesus promised that that generation would witness the destruction of Jerusalem. It happened in 70 A.D. <br>  <br>  Seven is the number of perfection. Seventy years after the birth of Jesus.<br>  <br>  His second prophecy deals with His return. He promised that the generation who witnessed the return of the Jews to the land God gave them, would be alive to see His return. The Jewish state was established on May 15, 1948. Add 70 years to that and you're looking at 2018. We won't have to wait much longer.

It did not include the day or the hour, but it included the conviction that all the righteous blood shed throughout history would be visited on "this generation". Paul took this seriously in his first letter to the church in Thessalonika, in which he assumed that he would be among the "we who are alive [who] will meet him in the air."<br>  <br>  Christian responses can be seen in later New Testament writings like Luke and John. The former treats the predictions as having to do only with the destruction of Jerusalem, and takes seriously that there will be an indefinite but not insignificant time when the church will continue and will need guidance and structure. The Gospel of John emphasizes that things people expected at the end of time can be present realities: a verdict regarding judgment, eternal life, etc. Presumably the appropriate thing to do is to follow the example of these later Christian authors in moving the focus away from expectations about the nearness of the end.<br>  <br>  I recommend Keith Ward's book _What the Bible Really Teaches_ as one of the few Christian books that takes seriously this aspect of the New Testament's contents.|`|189df82501b9730c10d7b0958473fc61aa	Live like everyday will be your last.|`|LlvxiDHCaa	doing everything you can possibly do to help the earth and it's inhabitants.

Si tiene otro talante y no es de los que resuelven las cosas a golpes, sabrá como encarar el problema con su mujer. Enfrentar a madre e hija sabiendo que habrá violencia complicará más el problema. Desde luego la ni?a es muy joven para exponerse de esa manera en internet y buscarse problemas. Necesitas un intermediario, te hablo del padre pero lo mismo sirve una abuela o la tía de la ni?a, el caso es que aborde a la madre alguien de confianza que sepa manejarla para que reflexione antes de actuar. La madre se enfadará, por supuesto, pero mejor que se acerque a su hija con una actitud constructiva que con una agresiva, porque pegarla, quitarla el ordenador o encerrarla en casa no evitará que la ni?a acceda a su página web desde el ordenador de otra persona. Hay que convencerla de que lo que está haciendo puede tener consecuencias, no enfrentarse a ella.|`|b03CNk8iaa	Cuál es el link?<br>  Solo para asegurarme de que no estas mintiendo...|`|f42e7b70013981ade0b4f83072e3f46daa	Es difícil entrometerse en ese tipo de temas, pero recuerda que la nena es menor, y que si fuera tu hija te gustaría que te lo dijeran.|`|giC629GWaa	Pues creo que deberías de decírselo, has intentado hablar con la cría y no has tenido éxito, así que habla con la madre intentando que no se lo tome excesivamente mal, ya que con 13 a?os la mayoría de las cosas que hacen es sin pensar en las consecuencias y diciéndole que una paliza no le hará entrar en razón a la ni?a.<br>  Imagino que tiene que ser difícil para ti pero tu amiga debería de saberlo cuanto antes....<br>  Salu2|`|m4wDTimqaa	Yo te aconsejo que contactes a MySpace y denuncies que la autora de la página es una menor de edad y que por lo tanto está infringiendo las políticas del sitio. <br>  <br>  No vale la pena que hables con tu amiga si eso puede ocasionarle un da?o más grande a la ni?a. Mejor toma cartas en el asunto directamente con MySpace hasta que cancelen la página. Y a la ni?a adviértele que si vuelve a las andadas, hablarás con su madre y le contarás todo. <br>  <br>  Si eso no funciona, olvídate del asunto porque es responsabilidad de su madre y no tuya estar al pendiente de su hija.<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|pIBDGi98aa	Mira....es un tema delicado, pero bueno...mi recomendación es que vuelvas a hablar con la ni?a (por que eso es!!).....trata de explicarle nuevamente que lo que hizo está mal, las consecuencias y riesgos que lo que hizo puede traerle y sobre todo que debe de quitar o modificar  su página y decirselo a su mamá....que sea ella quien hable con su mamá, si no quiere hacerlo dile que entonces tu se lo dirás a su mamá, que obvio la reacción de la mamá pueda ser peor que tu se lo digas a que ella misma afronte lo que hizo...eso es importante, que a esa edad afronte de cara las consecuencias de sus propios actos....′que ella le confiese a su mamá, que le explique por que lo hizo (no es necesario que se lo muestre) y que obviamente quite las imagenes y como te digo, aclarale que si ella no habla con su mamá tu lo harás y que conociendo a tu a amiga seguramente le irà peor....<br>  Lo mejor en esta vida es ser sinceros y hablar claramente las cosas.<br>  <br>  saludos y suerte!|`|q8N6DtJqaa	Si no te atreves a decirselo, mandale una notita con la direccion del spayce de su ni?a para que lo vea ella misma, hija y si la castiga o pega....si eso sirve para que la nena no lo haga más, pues bendita sea esa torta.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiHM9KWA8NsXIwBBe4q44D1o.gt.?qid=20070524052710AA6Vv5B">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|IsgY9IQraa	Si en verdad es tu amiga, debes decirle la verdad, de lo contrario cerra el ′pico.|`|lErXHEgoaa	hola creo que deberias tomar medidas sobre el asunto pues creo que la nena esta demasiado chiquis como para que este en esas cosas y esta a tiempo de corregir su vida y eso es importante pues deberias hablar con su madre y explicarle las cosas  de manera que las entienda y que no reaccione de forma violenta pues eso no es conveniente y seguramente la nena te odiara por el momento pero algun dia te lo agradecera|`|q3DFWm1Taa	pues lo ideal es q hables con la madre si es q su hija sali con poca ropa a su corta edad  .lo q debes hacer es o hablar con la pequena y decirle q puede correr riesgo con los depredadores de menores y si no obecese pues con la madre para q de alguna manera le haga entender q no es bueno haccer lo q hace . tu q sabes de esa nina ella lo hace con intencion de salir para q la vean en fotos o desea q la vean para modelar o con otro tipo de cosa ? averigua eso antes de hablar con la madre o con la nina buena suerte|`|73eeef0d7d795ef67a92df1696b54140aa	No se lo digas.

iLFYj6Qgaa	Literally, what day will you arrive = quel jour arriverez-vous.  But in practice, we also use the present for a fact in the near future.  And yes, you could, in theory, use the futur proche, but it's not really common in this case. Futur proche is rather used to express an intention, and here it's more a fact that that person will arrive at a certain date.|`|qpqZybQ1aa	I would use both the ''futur proche'' and the present tense here. It is true, however, that the futur proche is more so used to express intentions. But in Canadian French, for instance, ''futur proche'' is widely used orally, for all kinds of situations, more than in European French.|`|K9PmtBxkaa	Generally, futur proche is used when you want to do something in the near future. Present is for that particular moment. Even if you "What day are you going to arrive?" Quel jour allez-vous arriver ? still sounds correct, so i guess it's just on preference

Isso ainda fica bem evidente nos vocábulos costal (relativo às costelas) e intercostal (situado entre as costelas), onde aparece o radical puro. A saborosa carne que fica entre as costelas da rês, segundo o Aurélio e o Houaiss, é o entrecosto (do Francês entrec?te, "entre costelas"; eu prefiro chamá-lo pela forma aportuguesada de entrec?, como é usual aqui no Rio Grande do Sul).<br>  <br>  Com a forma??o do derivado costela, com uma vaga no??o diminutiva, as costas passaram a designar t?o simplesmente a parte de trás do tórax, o dorso; por isso falamos em nado de costas, deitar de costas, co?ar as costas, m?os atrás das costas, carregar o time nas costas, matar pelas costas, etc. Transpondo isso aos objetos, falamos nas costas da m?o, da cadeira, nas costas do papel."<br>  <br>  Se tens interesse por "curiosidades" da língua portuguesa, dá uma olhada no site www.sualingua.com<br>  é muito legal.<br>  Bjinho.|`|cdlc2ZU2aa	sua nadegas ou nadega = nadega <br>  sua bunda  ou bundas     = bunda <br>  logo ,conclua e nunca confunda c _ , com b_ _ _ a|`|sdlLmbswaa	Minhas costas...|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	Minhas costas.|`|aiMVf6seaa	O certo é minhas costas.

Você quer comparar o pai da crian?a com Deus. Minhas respostas:<br>  <br>  N?o, a crian?a n?o tinha plena capacidade para entender o perigo que passou, pois ela é muito pequena para entender. E pais que permitem tudo amam seus filhos, mas n?o compreendem a importancia de repreende-los quando cometem erros.<br>  Porém, há uma grande diferen?a entre o pai da crian?a e Deus... Deus n?o deixa nenhuma mensagem clara e inegavel de que ele está mesmo passando tal mensagem. A Biblia? Hmph, livros escritos por m?os humanas. E mesmo que tenha sido inspirada por Deus, eu me nego a acreditar que ninguem tenha alterado absolutamente nada do texto original (aquele que foi inspirado por Deus) para melhor se encaixar na ganancia destes seres humanos.|`|fce7f2e58e8b7354171bb6a3e2452fcdaa	A crian?a n?o é inocente como se sup?em.....Deus disse a Noé (Gn 8.22) As inten??es do cora??o do homem é má desde a sua meninice, raz?o pela qual a Bíblia diz: "Ensina a crian?a o caminho em que deve andar..." Há sim na crian?a, um período curto de inocência, ou seja, de impercep??o do pecado mas isso é um período muito curto. Foi por isso que Jesus disse: "aquele que n?o se fizer como uma crian?a n?o pode entrar no Reino de Deus", Porém, isso n?o quer dizer que a Crian?a em toda  a sua fase seja inocente ou destituida de pecado. Gra?a e paz.

GKyPL9T7aa	Because in the Qur'an it states that we should not believe in the Trinity or that God has any partners (i.e Father Son Holy Spirit) or relatives (Christianity gives the title of "God's son" to Jesus). It also says God is one. This clearly implies that the Islamic concept of God is pure monotheism, hence "We" is a royal pronoun.

Genesis 3:22 And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.'|`|GV7Z0JRiaa	No.|`|TUM8yGsLaa	first u need to understand arabic no offence.after that u will understand wether its a royal we or not as many words in arabic mean many meanings and it only in contxt that people can interpret it although it still is quite hard.espaecially translating it to different languages like english.thats why hopefully with the help of allah swt i will one day understand the arabic language to appreciate the holy quran.    p.s cus translating it to another language is not the word of god us muslims have to pray in arabic and not any other language when we pray. peace hopefully you will find the true path and may allah swt help u and get u there swiftly and make it easy for you|`|0gNKRdmiaa	No, because the Quran also says that God 'begets not and is not begotten'. That denies Trinity right there.  The problem with the Trinity is not that it's too complicated.  It's that it is false.  No need to flatter yourself thinking Muslims can only handle a simplified version of God, but that you as a Christian have the whole 'complicated'' truth.  Try reading some Muslim philosophy.    Look, the Pagan Arabs of the time of the Prophet already believed in multiple lesser intermediary gods.  They could've handled the Trinity concept very well.  The Trinity was after all designed to appeal to Roman and Greek pagans in the first place.  Telling the Arab pagans that God is One, Alone, indivisible was a lot harder than it would've been to tell them God had a son, or that the Holy Spirit was also God.  But the message of the Quran was to lead them to the truth, not to give them something false to believe in, so it outright denies the Trinity.|`|QVFx895Caa	As a Christian I see nothing holy about the Koran, It was written by the false prophet Muhammad, trying to be like other prophets with out the saving Knowledge of Jesus Christ and in a time and place if he was a true prophet of the living God he would of known that. His book was not inspired by the Holy Spirit of Gods Love and Grace but a book of hate against Gods Children, you better go back and read it again, and through it in the fire were it belongs.

E é melhor aceitar o que ele manda sem murmurar, pois da obediência a Deus depende nossa salva??o. é o que diz a Bíblia.|`|GH01a6Jqaa	Estamos sujeitos a muitas leis naturais, estabelecidas para o nosso bem. Uma delas é a lei da causa e efeito, ou, como diz a Bíblia, “o?que o homem semear, isso também ceifará”. (Gálatas 6:7) Uma vez reconhecido esse princípio, é possível considerar a probabilidade de certos eventos futuros.<br>  <br>  Por exemplo, se dirigirmos um carro descuidadamente em alta velocidade, a probabilidade de um acidente é maior do que se dirigirmos cautelosamente. Quem fuma tem maior probabilidade de contrair cancer do que o n?o-fumante. Admitidamente, parece improvável que aconte?am a nós certos eventos, como os ataques terroristas mencionados na abertura desta série. Assim, seria inútil calcular a sua probabilidade. Contudo, recorrer ao conceito do destino n?o nos leva a lugar nenhum. N?o ilumina o presente nem o futuro. Crer numa falsidade n?o dá nenhuma garantia real para o futuro. Tampouco dá ver a m?o de Deus em cada acontecimento.<br>  <br>  O nosso futuro n?o foi escrito com antecedência, mas está sendo moldado pelo presente. Embora a vida seja uma dádiva de Deus, a Bíblia indica claramente que temos um papel-chave na decis?o do nosso presente e do nosso futuro. Podermos escolher alegrar a Deus, ou, ao contrário, escolher entristecê-lo, mostra que Ele nos deu certa medida de controle sobre a nossa vida. —?Gênesis 6:6; Salmo 78:40; Provérbios 27:11.<br>  <br>  Além disso, as Escrituras Sagradas repetidamente enfatizam que o nosso futuro está ligado à nossa perseveran?a e ao nosso comportamento. Isso teria pouco sentido se as coisas já estivessem todas programadas. (Mateus 24:13; Lucas 10:25-28) Se, ent?o, escolhermos ser obedientes e fiés a Deus, que futuro poderemos esperar?<br>  <br>  A Bíblia revela que a humanidade terá um futuro muito brilhante. A Terra será transformada num paraíso, em que reinar?o a paz e a seguran?a. (Salmo 37:9-11; 46:8,?9) Esse futuro é certo, pois o todo-poderoso Criador cumprirá as suas promessas. (Isaías 55:11) Mas sermos aben?oados com a vida no Paraíso n?o depende do destino; depende de fazermos obedientemente a vontade de Deus agora. (2?Tessalonicenses 1:6-8; Revela??o [Apocalipse] 7:14, 15) Deus nos deu o livre-arbítrio e nos incentiva: ‘Escolha a vida para permanecer vivo.’ (Deuteron?mio 30:19) Qual será a sua escolha?|`|dCAYDrJOaa	é verdade. voce ja parou para pensar porque voce existe, por ser feliz, por ter amigo? voce nao teria nada se nao fosse por Deus|`|GQB8ONCnaa	Deus deu livre-arbítrio ao homem.

Mas tudo que acontece, é porque Deus "permitiu" que acontecesse.

Deus nunca interfere no nosso livre arbítrio, por isso Ele permite as conseqüências ruins, se semeamos coisas ruins, provavelmente colheremos coisas ruins e caso isso aconte?a, n?o temos direito algum de culpar à Deus por estarmos colhendo frutos ruins de árvores que nós mesmos plantamos.|`|WfhUbxDuaa	Mentira<br>  <br>  <br>  Deus nunca quer o mal.

Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I'm an atheist, but I believe that the Jesus of the Bible was a loving, caring, remarkable man.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!    What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|WZ6YXDODaa	He was such a wonderful being.

Por exemplo, próximoa a minha casa, um cantor e pregador famoso foi convidado a pregar, estipulou o pre?o, mas na hora que chegou, como era uma igreja de pessoas simples e humildes, n?o tinham conseguido o valor total do combinado. Cantou apentas uma música e bateu no púlpito e disse quero meu dinheiro agora, fizeram uma coleta, e infelismente n?o foi o suficiente para completar , ent?o disse: eu n?o vou ser envergonhado, sou cantor de Camboriú, n?o nesses lugares aqui. Foi um a vergonha para os verdadeiros servos de Deus.Eu concordo que muitos pregam, se deixam serem usados por Deus, e o resultados s?o grandes milagres, e muitas convers?es.Muitos, após terem deixados Deus os usarem, e grandes obras podem , se exaltar como este citado acima, e come?arem em nome da fama fazerem grandes serm?es, mas fica somente superficial, por exemplo, o que aconteceu com um grande pregador, aliás um dos melhores que o Brasil já teve, ao subir em um congresso para pregar, como era o pregador oficial, fez uma grande prega??o, com todo seu conhecimento apologético, e no final, disse: quem quer aceitar a Jesus como seu único e suficiente Salvador? Silêncio total, .....ent?o abaixou a cabe?o e desceu do púlpito humilhado de cabeixa baixa, ent?o uma senhora usada por Deus lhe disse: pastor, se o senhor tivesse subido ao púlpito da forma como o senhor está descendo, eu seria a primeira pessoa a tomar a decis?o em rela??o à sua pergunta.Conclus?o: N?o sou contra os grandes pregadores, mas sou a favor sim dos que s?o humildes e pregam n?o somente com seus conhecimentos aplogéticos, mas também com humildade e se deixam ser usados pelo Espírito Santo.|`|2CaXPv43aa	O bom pregador tem qe pregar akilo qe ele vive.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  :**|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	pregador deve saber que só pode pregar aquilo que ele vive, e para viver algo, tem que se acreditar nisso.|`|VJJhFOLeaa	Eu acredito que nos pregadores ate acreditamos, mas o difícil esta em você vivenciar o que você prega, pois ninguém vive totalmente o que se prega num púlpito, assim como ninguém vive a sua própria verdade que contem dentro de si.<br>  Pois somos falhos e pecadores.<br>  N?o estou falando de prega?oes como o irm?o colocou, n?o quero entrar neste mérito de julgar as pessoas, pois temos que ter temor ao Senhor.<br>  Paz do Senhor.|`|aW9HKCvHaa	Tomara que sim!|`|iLuZxmobaa	sim !!!<br>  Naum sou pregadora mas , todos nóis falamos aquilo em que acreditamos ....|`|jotalYkraa	acredito que sim. ao contrario estariam sendo hipócritas como poderiam pregar uma coisa que nao creem..|`|vBp1E6Quaa	A grande maioria acredita.|`|9B6jw0yCaa	que nada, quando uma pessoa acredita em uma coisa, pode ter serteza que foi por que alguem converteu, no caso da religi?o, foi o pastor que converteu, pelo menos eu acho isso...|`|Lhpb09p1aa	Eu prefiro acreditar que sim.

Quanto mais complicada a coisa criada, mais capacitado tem de ser o criador.<br>  <br>   Por exemplo, olhe ao seu redor, em sua casa. Mesas, cadeiras, escrivaninhas, camas, panelas, pratos e outros utensílios de cozinha, tudo isso requer alguém que os tenha feito, como se dá também com as paredes, os pisos e os tetos. Contudo, essas coisas s?o relativamente simples de fazer. Visto que as coisas simples exigem alguém que as tenha feito, n?o é lógico que as coisas complexas exijam um criador muito mais inteligente?<br>  <br>  Nosso Assombroso Universo<br>  <br>   Um relógio requer um fabricante de relógios. Que dizer de nosso infinitamente mais complexo sistema solar, com o Sol e seus planetas que giram em torno dele com uma precis?o de fra??o de segundo, século após século? Que dizer da assombrosa galáxia em que vivemos, chamada Via-Láctea, com seus mais de 100 bilh?es de estrelas? Já parou alguma vez à noite para observar a Via-Láctea? Ficou impressionado? Pense ent?o no incrivelmente vasto Universo que contém incontáveis bilh?es de galáxias como a nossa Via-Láctea! Ademais, os corpos celestes s?o t?o exatos nos seus movimentos, século após século, que têm sido comparados a cron?metros de alta precis?o.<br>  <br>   Se um relógio, que é relativamente simples, implica a existência de um fabricante de relógio, certamente o Universo, infinitamente mais complexo e mais assombroso, implica a existência de um projetista e criador. é por isso que a Bíblia nos convida a ‘levantar ao alto os nossos olhos e ver’, e daí pergunta: “Quem criou estas coisas?” A resposta: “Foi Aquele [Deus] que faz sair o exército delas até mesmo por número, chamando a todas elas por nome. Devido à abundancia de energia dinamica, sendo ele também vigoroso em poder, n?o falta nem sequer uma delas.” (Isaías 40:26) Assim, o Universo deve a sua existência a um poder invisível, controlador, inteligente —?Deus.<br>  <br>  A Terra Foi Projetada de Modo ímpar<br>  <br>   Quanto mais os cientistas estudam a Terra, mais se d?o conta de que ela foi projetada de modo ímpar para a habita??o humana. Fica a uma distancia exata do Sol para receber a quantidade certa de luz e calor. Uma vez por ano, gira em torno do Sol, numa exata inclina??o de angulo para tornar possíveis as esta??es em muitas partes da Terra. A Terra gira também em torno de seu próprio eixo a cada 24 horas, ocasionando períodos regulares de luz e de escurid?o. Possui uma atmosfera com uma mistura exata de gases, de modo que podemos respirar e ser protegidos da radia??o nociva vinda do espa?o. Possui também água e solo vitais, necessários para a produ??o de alimentos.<br>  <br>   Sem todos esses fatores e outros, que agem entre si, a vida seria impossível. Deu-se tudo isso por mero acaso? A revista Science News diz: “Parece que tais condi??es determinadas e precisas dificilmente poderiam ter surgido por acaso.” N?o, n?o poderiam. Envolvem projeto dirigido da parte de um superlativo Projetista.<br>  <br>   Se você entrasse numa bela casa e constatasse que ela estava generosamente abastecida de alimentos, que tinha excelente sistema de aquecimento e refrigera??o, e bom encanamento de água, a que conclus?o chegaria? Que tudo isso apareceu por si só? N?o, certamente concluiria que uma pessoa inteligente projetou e executou isso com grande cuidado. A Terra também foi projetada e feita com grande cuidado para prover às necessidades de seus habitantes, e ela é muito mais complexa e bem abastecida do que qualquer casa.<br>  <br>   Considere também o grande número de coisas que d?o prazer à vida. Veja a vasta variedade de flores, belamente coloridas, com seus agradáveis aromas que os humanos tanto apreciam. Há também a grande variedade de alimentos, t?o deliciosos ao nosso paladar. Há florestas, montanhas, lagos e outras cria??es agradáveis de contemplar. Também, que dizer dos lindos crepúsculos que aumentam o nosso prazer na vida? E no reino animal, n?o ficamos encantados com as cambalhotas e a natureza cativante de cachorrinhos, gatinhos e outros filhotes de animais? Portanto, a Terra provê muitas surpresas agradáveis, n?o absolutamente necessárias para sustentar a vida. Isto mostra que a Terra foi projetada com amor, visando a humanos, para que n?o só existíssemos, mas vivêssemos com prazer.<br>  <br>   Por conseguinte, a conclus?o razoável é reconhecer o Dador de tudo isso, como fez o escritor bíblico, que disse a respeito de Jeová Deus: “és tu quem fizeste os céus e a terra.” Com que objetivo? Ele dá a resposta descrevendo Deus como “o Formador da terra e Aquele que a fez, Aquele que a estabeleceu firmemente, que n?o a criou simplesmente para nada, que a formou mesmo para ser habitada”. —?Isaías 37:16; 45:18.<br>  <br>  A Surpreendente Célula Viva<br>  <br>   Que dizer das coisas vivas? N?o exigem um criador? Por exemplo, considere alguns dos aspectos surpreendentes de uma célula viva. O biólogo molecular Michael Denton, em seu livro Evolution: A Theory in Crisis (Evolu??o: Uma Teoria em Crise), declara: “Mesmo o mais simples de todos os sistemas de vida existentes hoje na Terra, as células bacteriais, s?o objetos extraordinariamente complexos. Embora a menor das células bacteriais seja incrivelmente pequena, .?.?. cada uma, com efeito, é uma verdadeira fábrica microminiaturizada que contém milhares de pe?as de projeto requintado de intricados mecanismos moleculares .?.?. muito mais complicados do que qualquer mecanismo construído pelo homem e absolutamente sem paralelo no mundo das coisas n?o-vivas.”<br>  <br>   Com respeito ao código genético em cada célula, ele diz: “A capacidade do ADN de armazenar informa??es excede amplamente a de qualquer outro sistema conhecido; é t?o eficiente que todas as informa??es necessárias para especificar um organismo t?o complexo como o homem pesam menos de alguns bilionésimos de um grama. .?.?. Comparados com o grau de inventividade e complexidade demonstrado pelo mecanismo molecular da vida, até mesmo os nossos mais avan?ados [produtos] parecem rústicos. Sentimo-nos humilhados.”<br>  <br>   Denton acrescenta: “A complexidade do mais simples tipo de célula conhecido é t?o grande que é impossível aceitar que tal objeto pudesse ter sido ajuntado subitamente por algum evento anormal, vastamente improvável.” Tinha de ter um projetista e um criador.<br>  <br>  Nosso Incrível Cérebro<br>  <br>   Diz a seguir este cientista: “Em termos de complexidade, uma célula individual n?o é nada em compara??o com um sistema como o do cérebro dos mamíferos. O cérebro humano é constituído de cerca de dez bilh?es de células nervosas. Cada célula nervosa produz cerca de dez mil a cem mil fibras de conex?o, por meio das quais faz contato com outras células nervosas no cérebro. Ao todo, o número de conex?es no cérebro humano aproxima-se .?.?. de um quatrilh?o.”<br>  <br>   Denton continua: “Mesmo se apenas um centésimo das conex?es no cérebro fosse especificamente organizado, isto ainda representaria um sistema que contém um número muito maior de conex?es específicas do que na inteira rede de comunica??es da Terra.” Daí, pergunta: “Poderia algum tipo de processo puramente casual ter montado esses sistemas?” Obviamente, a resposta tem de ser n?o. O cérebro obrigatoriamente teve um Projetista e Criador que se importa conosco.<br>  <br>   O cérebro humano faz com que até mesmo os mais avan?ados computadores pare?am rudimentares. O escritor sobre temas científicos Morton Hunt disse: “Nossas memórias ativas retêm vários bilh?es de vezes mais informa??es do que um grande computador contemporaneo de pesquisas.” Assim, o Dr.?Robert J.?White, um neurocirurgi?o, concluiu: “N?o tenho outra escolha sen?o reconhecer a existência dum Intelecto Superior, responsável pelo projeto e pelo desenvolvimento da incrível rela??o entre o cérebro e a mente —?algo muito além da capacidade de compreens?o do homem. .?.?. Tenho de crer que tudo isto teve um come?o inteligente, que Alguém fez que acontecesse.” Tinha também de ser Alguém que se importou conosco.<br>  <br>  O Excepcional Sistema Sanguíneo<br>  <br>   Considere, também, o excepcional sistema sanguíneo que transporta nutrientes e oxigênio e protege contra infec??es. Com respeito aos glóbulos vermelhos, um dos principais componentes desse sistema, o livro ABC’s of the Human Body (ABC do Corpo Humano) declara: “Uma única gota de sangue contém mais de 250 milh?es de glóbulos sanguíneos distintos .?.?. O corpo contém talvez 25 trilh?es deles, o suficiente, se estendidos, para cobrir quatro quadras de tênis. .?.?. Substitui??es ocorrem num índice de 3?milh?es de células novas por segundo.”<br>  <br>   Com respeito aos glóbulos brancos, outro componente do excepcional sistema sanguíneo, essa mesma fonte nos diz: “Embora exista apenas uma espécie de glóbulos vermelhos, os glóbulos brancos s?o de uma grande variedade, sendo cada tipo capaz de travar os combates do corpo de modo diferente. Uma espécie, por exemplo, destrói as células mortas. Outras espécies produzem anticorpos contra os vírus, desintoxicam substancias estranhas, ou literalmente comem e digerem bactérias.”<br>  <br>   Que sistema estupendo e altamente organizado! Certamente, qualquer coisa t?o bem coordenada e t?o plenamente protetora tem de ter um organizador muito inteligente e que se importa —?Deus.<br>  <br>  Outras Maravilhas<br>  <br>   Existem muitas outras maravilhas no corpo humano. Uma dessas é o olho, t?o extraordinariamente bem projetado que nenhuma máquina fotográfica pode imitá-lo. O astr?nomo Robert Jastrow disse: “O olho parece ter sido projetado; nenhum projetista de telescópios teria feito melhor.” E a publica??o Popular Photography (Fotografia Popular) relata: “Os olhos humanos vêem uma extens?o muito maior de pormenores do que um filme. Vêem em três dimens?es, num angulo tremendamente amplo, sem distor??o, em movimento contínuo .?.?. Comparar a máquina fotográfica com o olho humano n?o é uma analogia justa. O olho humano é mais como um incrivelmente avan?ado supercomputador com inteligência artificial, com habilidades de processamento de informa??es, velocidades e modos de opera??o que v?o muito além de qualquer dispositivo, computador ou máquina fotográfica feitos pelo homem.”<br>  <br>   Pense também em como todos os complexos órg?os do corpo cooperam sem nosso esfor?o consciente. Por exemplo, colocamos muitos tipos diferentes de alimento e bebida no est?mago, contudo o nosso corpo os processa e produz energia. Experimente colocar essa variedade de coisas dentro do tanque de gasolina de um automóvel e observe até onde vai! Existe também o milagre do nascimento, a forma??o de um encantador bebê —?uma réplica de seus pais —?em apenas nove meses. E que dizer da habilidade de uma crian?a de apenas alguns anos aprender a falar uma língua complexa?<br>  <br>   Sim, as muitas cria??es surpreendentes e complexas no corpo humano nos deixam assombrados. Nenhum engenheiro poderia reproduzir essas coisas. Poderiam tais coisas ser meramente produtos do acaso? Certamente que n?o. Em vez disso, ao considerarem todos os maravilhosos aspectos do corpo humano, as pessoas razoáveis dizem, como o salmista: “Elogiar-te-ei [Deus] porque fui feito maravilhosamente, dum modo atemorizante. Teus trabalhos s?o maravilhosos.” —?Salmo 139:14.<br>  <br>  O Construtor Supremo<br>  <br>   A Bíblia declara: “Toda casa é construída por alguém; mas Deus é que construiu todas as coisas.” (Hebreus 3:4, Bíblia Mensagem de Deus) Se qualquer casa, por mais simples que seja, tem de ter um construtor, o muito mais complexo Universo, com as vastas variedades de vida na Terra, também deve ter tido um construtor. E, assim como reconhecemos a existência de humanos que inventaram aparelhos como avi?es, televisores e computadores, n?o deveríamos também reconhecer a existência Daquele que deu aos humanos o cérebro para fazerem tais coisas?<br>  <br>   A Bíblia faz isso, chamando-o de “verdadeiro Deus, Jeová, o Criador dos céus e o Grandioso que os estendeu; Aquele que estirou a terra e seu produto, Aquele que dá respira??o ao povo sobre ela”. (Isaías 42:5) A Bíblia declara com boa raz?o: “Digno és, Jeová, sim, nosso Deus, de receber a glória, e a honra, e o poder, porque criaste todas as coisas e porque elas existiram e foram criadas por tua vontade.” —?Revela??o (Apocalipse) 4:11.<br>  <br>   Realmente, podemos saber que Deus existe à base das coisas que ele fez. “Pois as .?.?. qualidades invisíveis [de Deus] s?o claramente vistas desde a cria??o do mundo em diante, porque s?o percebidas por meio das coisas feitas [por Deus].” —?Romanos 1:20.<br>  <br>   O fato de algo feito ser empregado mal n?o significa que n?o houve quem o fizesse. O avi?o pode ser usado para fins pacíficos, como transportar passageiros. Mas pode também ser usado para destrui??o, como bombardeiro. Ser ele usado para matan?a n?o significa que n?o houve quem o fizesse.<br>  <br>   Da mesma forma, o fato de, com tanta freqüência, os humanos se terem tornado maus n?o significa que n?o tiveram um Criador, que Deus n?o existe. Assim, a Bíblia diz corretamente: “A perversidade de vós, homens! Deve o próprio oleiro ser considerado igual ao barro? Acaso deve a coisa feita dizer referente àquele que a fez: ‘Ele n?o me fez’? E acaso a própria coisa formada diz realmente referente àquele que a formou: ‘Ele n?o mostrou entendimento’?” —?Isaías 29:16.<br>  <br>   O Criador mostrou sua sabedoria por meio da estupenda complexidade daquilo que fez. Demonstrou que realmente se importa conosco por ter feito a Terra exatamente como devia ser feita para ser habitável, por fazer nosso corpo e nossa mente de maneira t?o maravilhosa, e por fazer tantas outras coisas boas para o nosso usufruto.|`|IE9m4c7Taa	A Bíblia foi o único livro que DEUS manifestou a sua existência, e bem-aventurado aquele que nela acrê pois encontrará nela a salva??o, e vida eterna em Jesus Cristo.<br>  <br>  Centuri?o.

Es decir: hay personas cuya existencia la fundamentan bajo la premisa que "algo externo a mi, influye en mi vida y me condiciona cada acción". Al aceptarse ese condicionamiento, da como resultado que se acepta tanto a la brujería, como cualquier otra truculencia taumatúrgica.

O Espírito Santo de Deus. E quando este se apresentou aos homens, pareciam embebedados de tanto poder. A partir de ent?o, as línguas estranhas come?aram a fazer parte da vida de muitos. Vamos imaginar que uma esta??o de rádio emite ondas senoidais em determinada frequência, e somente rádios podem recebê-las. As batedeiras, os liquidificadores, os ferros de passar s?o também eletrodomésticos, mas nenhum é capaz de captar estas ondas. Mesmo os rádios precisam ser sintonizados na frequência exata. Da mesma forma, estas ondas puras de Deus existem e poucos s?o os sintonizados nestas. S?o privilegiados. Alguns fingem, porque falam muitas vogais e consoantes. Os carismáticos têm exercícios vocais, mas n?o s?o do cora??o. S?o da boca. Falar línguas é um dom do Espírito Santo, discernir se s?o verdadeiras é outro dom e interpretar o que significam é outro dom. E quem recebe o Espírito Santo salta, chora, canta louvores que nunca foram entoados.  Isto é uma liga??o direta com Deus, pode haver coisa melhor? Somente as igrejas pentecostais buscam estas maravilhas na sua essência, e nem todos a conseguem. Aliás, poucos. Eu queria ser um destes rádios, mas até agora Deus n?o me brindou com isso. Achava que tudo era teatrinho, mas vi que os arrogantes n?o eram brindados com isso, e sim, os humildes e dados a ora??o. A ciência precisa ser polêmica e tentar desbaratar as coisas estabelecidas, principalmente se mexe com a fé das pessoas. Se desde os romanos já se fala como "língua dos deuses" e na virada do século nos EUA as pessoas come?avam a sentir o poder de Deus, alguns a falar estas línguas e outros até a cair no ch?o um ou dois quarteir?es antes da igreja, é porque algo há além do que sup?e a nossa v? filosofia. Pense nisso e abra o seu cora??o com menos dúvidas, porque eu já passei por isso e me arrependo do que falei ou pensei, ok?

Se você olhar num dicionário verá que este é o significado. O dicionário Michaelis traz a seguinte defini??o para o verbete "dizimo", A décima parte (substantivo masculino). <br>  <br>  Em Malaquias 3:10 você vê que esta prática é uma solicita??o de Deus. Aqueles que separam dez por cento dos lucros para a obra de Deus ser?o ricamente recompensados. Deus é quem promete. <br>  <br>  “Trazei todos os dízimos à casa do Tesouro, para que haja mantimento na minha casa; e provai-me nisto, diz o SENHOR dos Exércitos, se eu n?o vos abrir as janelas do céu e n?o derramar sobre vós bên??o sem medida.” (Malaquias 3:10 RA) <br>  <br>  O dízimo é fruto de um cora??o agradecido, por tudo que o Senhor tem proporcionado. Ajudar financeiramente para a constru??o do reino de Deus neste mundo. mediante os dízimos e ofertas, é um privilégio. <br>  <br>  A finalidade do dízimo é aben?oar aquele que o separa. O dizímista passa a ser mais íntimo de Deus e torna-se menos egoísta.|`|B3hWeg80aa	1 Cor. 16: 2 No primeiro dia da semana cada um de vós ponha de parte o que PUDER AJUNTAR, conforme a sua prosperidade, para que n?o se fa?am as coletas quando eu chegar. <br>  <br>  2 Cor. 9:6 E digo isto: Que o que semeia pouco, pouco também ceifará; e o que semeia em abundáncia, em abundáncia ceifará. <br>  7 Cada um contribua segundo PROP?S NO SEU CORA??O; n?o com tristeza, ou por NECESSIDADE; porque Deus ama ao que dá com alegria. <br>  <br>  Na bíblia "dízimo" é a décima parte (ou 10%) de todos os pertences que a pessoa tem... Diz acima que o crist?o dá o que 'puder ajuntar' conforme 'prop?s no seu cora??o' e n?o por 'necessidade'... E nem a décima parte ou 10% por cento do que o crist?o tem.<br>  <br>  Talvêz a confus?o reside justamente em chamar de DíZIMO a contribui??o ou oferta voluntária que o crist?o de bom grado dá pela congrega??o ou igreja.

O espa?o é pequeno para discertar sobre este tema. Irei, pois, me restringir às quest?es do dízimo e da convers?o sob o ponto de vista histórico que será suficiente para dirimir sua dúvida. A religi?o protestante, que nasceu no século XVI através de Martin Lutero, emergiu entre outras raz?es por causa da ostenta??o, tanto econ?nica quanto política, da igreja católica e a venda de indultos para os fiés, a qual  nada mais era que adquirir um "passaporte para o céu". Alguns séculos depois, imigrantes irlandeses, nos Estados Unidos, fundaram inúmeras igrejas protestantes (atualmente denominadas pentecostais e neo-pentescostais) que migraram para vários países, inclusive o Brasil onde s?o dezenas. Nesse período, cerca de menos de 100 anos, "TUDO MUDOU". Isto é, o princípio de Lutero, contrário à venda de indultos, hoje se transformou no dízimo (o qual é condenado por Jesus, vide LUCAS cap 18, vs 12 a 14) que, A BEM DA VERDADE trata-se de uma prática judaica pois está no Torah (Velho Testamento) e todas as cita??es de dízimo no Novo Testamento, que é a Bíblia Crist?, aludem livros do Torah. E, no que concerne, à convers?o (na pergunta, o termo "passa para sua religi?o") também há uma distor??o. A manifesta??o do Espírito Santo, ocorrida com os discípulos de Jesus (vide Atos, cap. 2 vs 1 a 4) foi uma passagem histórica que N?O SE REPETE, é restrita aos apóstolos! As "convers?es" atuais nada mais s?o que uma "como??o emocional". Explico... pessoas que se encontram em sérias dificuldades v?o às igrejas evangélicas e, ante a um "misanscene" (misto de sons estridentes, repeti??o inscansável de palavras, gritos, urros, luzes, etc) de um pastor, têm a sensa??o que Deus está se manifestando, e aí "se convertem". A tradu??o disso é "condicionamento neurolinguístico". Em suma, nem dízimo nem convers?o se encontram nos preceitos primordiais e essenciais do Protestantismo. Ao contrário. Pense comigo... "Se a oposi??o à venda de indultos, para absolvi??o dos pecados, era uma das premissas do Protestantismo (que hoje se denomina Pentescostal ou Neo-Pentescostal) porque uma das condi??es para ser  "protestante" é o dízimo?" Por outro lado, ainda existe uma forma de "coa??o".  Ou seja, quem n?o se "converter" estará condenado ao inferno e à "segunda morte" (Apocalipse cap 21, vs 8)? Isso é correto???|`|88rYT51oaa	leia a parabola do bom samaritana ....<br>  e vera que o proximo e o alvo do nosso bem<br>  ou seja todo aquele que podemos fazer o bem<br>  e ja a quest?o do pastor .. esta escrito que<br>  digno e o obreiro de seu salario e outra ainda<br>  n?o atar a boca do boi que debulha<br>  onde o proprio apostolo paulo usou<br>  desta passagem para se defnder quando<br>  ao viver do ministerio.... pois como ja te disse<br>  digno e o obreiro de seu salario<br>  <br>  um forte abra?o<br>  fica na paz|`|FVsnHM3faa	Acredito que nao.Mas existe tipos de pessoas que se diz crentes e na verdade estao em puro interesses.<br>  O dia que vc ver esse tipo de coisa pode ver que nao se trata de pessoas que seguem o evangelho.Essas pessoas precisam conhecer a Deus.<br>  Pq Deus nao faz de sua casa uma casa de vendas e trocas...<br>  Jesus destruiu tudo o que acontecia no seu templo,homens vendendo animais, fazendo trocas de dinheiro... um verdadeiro mercado!E Jesus disse:"Tirem tudo isso daqui!Parem de fazer da casa do meu Pai um mercado!"<br>  E Jesus voltaria para construir um novo templo em  3 dias, sendo q akele demorou 46 anos....

A veracidade das suas palavras é absoluta e Inatacável Aqueles, porém, que a explicam e interpretam, podem′se enganar de diversas maneiras, cometer′se′iam funestos e numerosos erros se se quisesse sempre seguir o sentido literal das palavras; chegaríamos a contradi??es grosseiras, erros, doutrinas ímpias, porque seriamos for?ados a dizer que Deus tem pés, m?os, olhos, etc... Em quest?es de ciências naturais, a Sagrada Escritura deveria ocupar o último lugar A S. Escritura e a natureza provém ambas da Palavra de Deus; aquela foi inspirada pelo Espirito Santo, esta executa fielmente as leis estabelecidas por Deus. Mas, ao passo que a Bíblia, acomodando′se à compreens?o do comum dos homens, fala em muitos casos, e com raz?o, conforme as aparências, e usa de termos que n?o s?o destinados ;a exprimir a verdade absoluta, a natureza se conforma rlgorosa e Invariavelmente às leis que Ihe foram dadas; n?o se pode, pois, em nome da S. Escritura, p?r em dúvida um resultado manifesto adquirido por maduras observa??es ou por provas suficientes... O Espirito Santo n?o quis ensinar′nos se o céu está em movimento ou se é imóvel; se tem forma de globo ou forma de disco; se ele ou a terra se move ou permanece em repouso... Já que o Espirito Santo n?o intencionou instruir′nos a respeito dessas coisas, porque isto n?o importava aos seus design?os, que s?o a salva??o das nossas almas, como se pode, agora, pretender que é necessário sustentar nesses assuntos tal ou tal opini?o, que uma é de fé e a outra é err?nea ?

Os católicos tem um representante acima de todos (no topo de uma hierarquia: padres-bispos-arcebispos-cardeais) que simboliza a figura de Pedro, um dos apóstolos mais atormentados do seu Mestre. E esse representante-mor passou a simbolizar a própria divindade, como se fosse a imagem viva do Filho, "vicarius fili dei".<br>  <br>  Assim, se os protestantes se limitam a acatarem ordens de seus pastores e presbíteros, os católicos esperam a palavra infalível (uma vez que julgada inspirada pelo próprio Deus) do Sumo Pontífice, o Papa.<br>  <br>  é um fen?meno que faz adorar a Santos e Beatos, a necessidade de ter-se algo mais 'palpável' no qual concentrar a fé.

10HP0P2Oaa	Porque as músicas que n?o s?o evangélicas, em sua maioria (n?o s?o todas) falam de pecado, s?o tendenciosas para o lado negativo e seus cantores buscam a sua própria glória. Pare, observe bem e veja se n?o é verdade. Muitas delas nos passam uma certa tristeza, enquanto que as "músicas" evangélicas s?o direcionadas, muitas vezes, a Deus como louvor e adora??o, ou passam mensagens de vitórias, de bên??os, de ora??o que alegram o nosso cora??o.

A energia da Terra precisa ser renovada. As idéias novas necessitam de muito mais espa?o para vingar. O corpo e a alma est?o sedentos de novos caminhos para percorrer. O futuro bate à nossa porta, e todas as idéias – exceto as que envolvem todo e qualquer tipo de preconceito – ter?o chance de aparecer e ser valorizadas pelas pessoas. Tudo o que for importante ficará. E tudo aquilo considerado inútil desaparecerá. é preciso entendermos que n?o somos juízes dos sonhos do nosso próximo. Para ter fé em nosso caminho, n?o precisamos provar que o caminho dos outros está errado. Quem age assim n?o confia nos próprios passos e n?o consegue seguir adiante. Paulo Coelho (Extra)
IDp8m1Foaa	Sinceramente, nenhum homossexual gostaria de saber o que a bíblia diz (consequentemente é o que Deus diz) sobre este tema. <br>  <br>       Primeiro vamos ver no Antigo Testamento,<br>  <br>     A primeira referência ao homossexualismo está no livro de Gênesis capítulo 19, quando os habitantes das cidades Sodoma e Gomorra tentaram violentar sexualmente dois anjos com aparência humana. <br>  <br>      Há, ainda, no antigo Testamento duas passagens muito claras a respeito do homossexualismo. S?o Levítico 18:22 2 Levítico 20:13 que dizem o seguinte, respectivamente: <br>  <br>  “Com homem n?o te deitarás como se fosse mulher; é abomina??o” e “Se também um homem se deitar com outro homem, como se fosse mulher, ambos praticaram coisa abominável; ser?o mortos; o seu sangue cairá sobre eles”. <br>  <br>      No Novo Testamento,<br>  <br>     O apóstolo Paulo afirmou que o homossexualismo contrariava os propósitos morais, sexuais, sociais e espirituais de Deus para homens e mulheres. <br>  <br>  Depois de afirmar que os romanos haviam trocado a verdade de Deus pela mentira, ele declarou em Romanos 1.26 e 27: <br>  “porque até as suas mulheres trocaram o modo natural de suas rela??es íntimas, por outro contrário à natureza; semelhantemente, os homens também, deixando o contato natural da mulher, se inflamaram mutuamente em sua sensualidade, cometendo torpeza, homens com homens, e recebendo em si mesmos a merecida puni??o do seu erro.” <br>  <br>     O apóstolo Paulo também declara aos coríntios:<br>  <br>    "N?o vos enganeis: nem impuros, nem idólatras, nem adúlteros, NEM EFEMINADOS, nem sodomitas, ...,  herdar?o o reino de Deus"  ( 1Cor 6:9-11)<br>  <br>     Deus exige que aprendamos a nos dominar para negar nossos desejos pecaminosos e para aceitar os limites que ele colocou ao nosso comportamento (2 Pedro 1:6; Gálatas 5:23). <br>         Este é o princípio que tem que ser aplicado aos desejos homossexuais que algumas pessoas sentem. Em vez de perder tempo e energia tentando justificar estes desejos na base da Genética, ou tentando p?r a culpa deles nas influências da infancia, a pessoa que é tentada a ter rela??es sexuais com alguém do mesmo sexo precisa aprender a dominar seus desejos.<br>          Por quê? Porque Deus clara e absolutamente condenou as rela??es homossexuais.<br>  <br>    A Paz!!|`|2BP2mdIwaa	leia   romanos 1:27<br>  se também um homem se deitar com outro homem como se fosse mulher, ser?o mortos; leviticos 20:13|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	O Que Diz a Bíblia sobre Homossexualismo?<br>  <br>  Todos somos tentados por desejos de coisas que Deus proibiu (Tiago 1:14-15). Eva desejou o fruto proibido no éden (Gênesis 3:6). Algumas pessoas desejam ganho desonesto (Tito 1:7). Alguns homens desejam as esposas de outros (Mateus 5:28). Algumas pessoas desejam outras do mesmo sexo Gênesis 19:4-5).<br>  <br>  Deus exige que aprendamos a nos dominar para negar nossos desejos pecaminosos e para aceitar os limites que ele colocou ao nosso comportamento (2 Pedro 1:6; Gálatas 5:23). Este é o princípio que tem que ser aplicado aos desejos homossexuais que algumas pessoas sentem. Em vez de perder tempo e energia tentando justificar estes desejos na base da Genética, ou tentando p?r a culpa deles nas influências da infancia, a pessoa que é tentada a ter rela??es sexuais com alguém do mesmo sexo precisa aprender a dominar seus desejos. Por quê? Porque Deus clara e absolutamente condenou as rela??es homossexuais.<br>  <br>  "Por causa disso, os entregou Deus a paix?es infames; porque até as mulheres mudaram o modo natural de suas rela??es íntimas por outro, contrário à natureza; semelhantemente, os homens também, deixando o contacto natural da mulher, se inflamaram mutuamente em sua sensualidade, cometendo torpeza, homens com homens, e recebendo, em si mesmos, a merecida puni??o do seu erro" (Romanos 1:26-27).<br>  <br>  "N?o vos enganeis: nem impuros, nem idólatras, nem adúlteros, nem efeminados, nem sodomitas . . . herdar?o o reino de Deus" (1 Coríntios 6:9-10).<br>  <br>  Deus aprova as rela??es sexuais entre um homem e sua esposa legítima (de acordo com a lei de Deus). Todas as outras rela??es sexuais sejam homossexuais ou heterossexuais s?o sempre e absolutamente proibidas (Hebreus 13:4). N?o nos cabe procurar desculpas para justificar o pecado. é nossa responsa-bilidade buscar o meio de vencer a tenta??o (1 Coríntios 10:13; Tiago 4:7-10).<br>  <br>  -Escrito por Dennis Allan|`|XeolGdbLaa	o mesmo que ela diz pra 99% das coisas que nos s?o "lícitas": vai arder no inferno por toda eternidade!|`|7ab2mraHaa	Que é uma abomina??o, que vai contra a natureza e que pessoas assim devem ser mortas, mas isso no velho testamento.

Apenas a espiritualidade pode arriscar uma explica??o plausível, ao dizer que é o modo da natureza equilibrar os atributos masculinos ou femininos em excesso. Deus é Amor, conforme desvendou Jesus, e ele ama a todos, sem preconceitos, sem fazer acep??o de pessoas. O Amor, o perfeito amor divino, é um sentimento assexuado, n?o tem preferência alguma, emana da pessoa como a água da fonte, ou o perfume da flor. Será que a fonte deixaria de jorrar para um homossexual ou para um bissexual que estivesse morrendo de sede? Se todos nós estivermos sedentos de Deus, ele deixaria de nos atender por algum motivo? Eu, nesta vida, sou heterossexual. Condenaria, sim, a prática sexual dos homossexuais, mas n?o a pessoa humana deles, manja? Que aceitem o fen?meno como prova??o de castidade, embora possam amar com ternura quem quiser, n?o é pelo amor que ser?o rejeitados pelos anjos, muito pelo contrário. Mas a prática, em si, eu acho muito chocante, n?o ousaria dizer asquerosa em se tratando de uma rea??o muito subjetiva que poderia ser considerada como preconceituosa. Deus ama o pecador, mas aconselha ternamente a evitarmos a aparência do pecado, pelo menos enquanto n?o nos tornamos assexuados como os anjos dos céus. é para lá que caminhamos, mesmo aos trancos e barrancos.

f90f5e562a648820bf133f7d63cebe5faa	Ok, I took a study that helped with this.  In Beth Moore's study of Daniel she talks about the different ideas behind end time events.  If you are interested in that you might see if a church near you is teaching it, or you can order CDs and a workbook from Lifeway.com.  The DVD is the best version because some of her explanations are pretty heavy and the visual aids she provides help, but what ever you can do...<br>  <br>  Her explanation goes into much of what is discussed on the link you gave with the Amillenialism (Basically they that Christs 1000 year reign is a figuretive number and is happening now in the church age.  They believe we are living in a time where Satan is currently bound in the pit, and upon Christs return judgement will immediately happen- to me this one makes no sense. Satan is bound NOW?) and Premillemmialism (the belief that Christ will literally reign on earth for 1000 years).  <br>  <br>  Premillennnialists break into two types Historic Premillennialists and Disepensational Premillenialism.  Historic Pre. believe that we are currently in a "church age", then there will be a time of tribulation, then Christ will return and the dead and living in Christ will reign on earth for 1000 years.  This is the "other side of the rapture" you asked about.  They believe Christians will remain for the tribulation before Christs return.<br>  <br>  The next belief is Dispensational Premillennialism (I am not loving you for making me type these big words, and I am sorry if i mix up the letters sometimes :) )  Basically this is what I believe.  And it is the idea that Beth follows in her study.  Dispensationalist see Israel as God's people but, distinct from the church.  The tribulation  and the millenium fullfills Gods promises for Israel, but the rapture (either before the antichrist comes to power and begins a 7 year tribulation period OR at 3 1/2 years when he becomes indwelt and is "ressurected")  takes the church to Heaven and allows Gods promises and judgements to fall upon the nation of Israel and the unrepentant only.<br>  <br>  Both forms of premillennialism agree about what happens after Christs literal and physical 1000 reign on earth.  That Satan will be loosed, join forces with unbelievers and attempt to overthrow Christ and His followers.  They will however be quickly defeated.  At this point all unbelievers who have died throughout history will stand judgement and believers will have a seperate "white throne" judgement.<br>  <br>  It is really just different interpretations of Daniel and Revelations, and really when you get down to it, it just does not matter.  I mean here is the thing, if you believe in Christ, really believe, but you believe that the pre trib rapture is an accurate interpretation, would you stop believing when the antichrist came to power?  Or maybe you would say, ok it must mean the rapture will happen in 3 1/2 years, if it didn't is that what your faith rests on?<br>  <br>  The important thing to remember is that Christ will return.  NO ONE knows when.  The bible does not tell us that.  The apostles thought it would be in their lifetime.  People of every generation since then has believed that.  There are signs, there are things that have to happen, prophesy that must be fullfilled, but we are getting to the point where it seems close.  When Israel was acknowledged as a soverign nation in 1948 that was a huge step.  Since there is prophesy of an attack coming from the land Gog and Magog (Russia, Iran and other Persian nations) against Israel, but looking at recent headlines about Russian and Iranian threats this could happen tomorrow (or 1000 years from now) and that attack will be quickly followed by the rise of the antichrist who will negotiate a 7 year peace treaty with Israel and the 7 years of tribulation will begin.  Again this is interpretation.  Some belive the temple will have to be rebuilt before the antichrist comes to power, others believe it will happen while he is in power, it is prophesied that sacrifices and temple rituals will be allowed during his reign, and that the temple will be rebuilt, but not clear on the timeline.  I think those who are adamant that it will be rebuilt during are trying to remove road blocks from Christs return. The truth is we don't know, and Christ does not need us to help Him desipher prophesy.  He knows when He is coming.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember is CHRIST WILL RETURN.  And He will defeat Satan.  And believers do receive eternal life.  The rest is an interesting debate and the study of great scholars, but just not important to belief.  It is nice to try and guess what God will do, but really looking around, we often have no idea.  So, I wait, expectant, hopeful, excited, and curious to see exactly what my God will do to amaze me next.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Have a great night.|`|10DjXLlWaa	you don't need to read "wikipedia," Read Revelations in the Bible. You can find Revelation in the Index of the Bible.

13c3e011d75bc182bbcb7576ad673befaa	O Que a Bíblia Diz?<br>  O que é blasfêmia contra o Espírito Santo?<br>  Conforme a popularidade de Jesus crescia, seus inimigos procuravam, desesperadamente, meios para explicar seus maravilhosos poderes. Finalmente, decidiram alegar que ele expulsava dem?nios pelo poder do próprio Satanás (Mateus 12:22-32; Marcos 3:22-30; Lucas 11:14-23). Jesus respondeu com três argumentos e uma advertência. <br>  <br>  Seus argumentos foram os seguintes: <br>  <br>  1. Satanás n?o atacaria a si mesmo, pois ninguém luta contra si mesmo. <br>  <br>  2. Se eu expulso dem?nios por Satanás, como seus filhos os expelem? <br>  <br>  3. Para roubar a casa de um homem forte, tem-se primeiro que amarrá-lo. Expulsando dem?nios, estou amarrando Satanás, de modo que eu possa cumprir minha miss?o de resgatar àqueles que Satanás mantém cativos. <br>  <br>  Sua advertência foi: "Em verdade vos digo que tudo será perdoado aos filhos dos homens: os pecados e as blasfêmias que proferirem. Mas aquele que blasfemar contra o Espírito Santo n?o tem perd?o para sempre, visto que é réu de pecado eterno." (Marcos 3:28-30). <br>  <br>  O que é este pecado imperdoável? Muitos trechos ensinam que é possível ir t?o longe de Deus que n?o se pode retornar. Paulo adverte sobre consciências insensíveis (1 Timóteo 4:2). Hebreus fala de cora??es endurecidos (capítulo 3) e daqueles que n?o podem ser trazidos de volta ao arrependi-mento (capítulo 6). Jo?o fala daqueles cujos pecados levam à morte, uma vez que eles se recusam a se arrependerem e a confessá-los (1 Jo?o 5:16-17). O próprio Jesus fala do solo que foi pisoteado e compactado ao ponto em que nenhuma semente pode germinar (Lucas 8:5). Cada passo que damos afastando-nos de Deus aproxima-nos do ponto sem retorno. Podemos perder o poder moral para mudar e voltar ao Senhor. <br>  <br>  O problema, naturalmente, n?o está na vontade de Deus de perdoar o pecador (Lucas 15; 2 Pedro 3:9). Deus alegremente aceita e perdoa a todos que se arrependem. O problema está em que alguns rejeitam cada tentativa de Deus para motivar o arrependi-mento. Depois que Jesus deixou a terra, o Espírito Santo veio para revelar a mensagem final da salva??o. Para aqueles que a recusam e se voltam contra o Espírito Santo, Deus n?o tem nenhum outro plano. N?o há outro sacri-fício pelo pecado (Hebreus 10:26-31). Aqueles cujo estado endurecido faz com que recusem o rogo final de Deus, nunca ser?o perdoados. Esta é a blasfêmia contra o Espírito Santo.

Finalmente, decidiram alegar que ele expulsava dem?nios pelo poder do próprio Satanás (Mateus 12:22-32; Marcos 3:22-30; Lucas 11:14-23). Jesus respondeu com três argumentos e uma advertência. <br>  <br>  Seus argumentos foram os seguintes: <br>  <br>  1. Satanás n?o atacaria a si mesmo, pois ninguém luta contra si mesmo. <br>  <br>  2. Se eu expulso dem?nios por Satanás, como seus filhos os expelem? <br>  <br>  3. Para roubar a casa de um homem forte, tem-se primeiro que amarrá-lo. Expulsando dem?nios, estou amarrando Satanás, de modo que eu possa cumprir minha miss?o de resgatar àqueles que Satanás mantém cativos. <br>  <br>  Sua advertência foi: "Em verdade vos digo que tudo será perdoado aos filhos dos homens: os pecados e as blasfêmias que proferirem. Mas aquele que blasfemar contra o Espírito Santo n?o tem perd?o para sempre, visto que é réu de pecado eterno." (Marcos 3:28-30). <br>  <br>  O que é este pecado imperdoável? Muitos trechos ensinam que é possível ir t?o longe de Deus que n?o se pode retornar. Paulo adverte sobre consciências insensíveis (1 Timóteo 4:2). Hebreus fala de cora??es endurecidos (capítulo 3) e daqueles que n?o podem ser trazidos de volta ao arrependi-mento (capítulo 6). Jo?o fala daqueles cujos pecados levam à morte, uma vez que eles se recusam a se arrependerem e a confessá-los (1 Jo?o 5:16-17).

Esque?am tudo isso e passem a viver um vida digna, respeitem o seu proximo, promovam a justi?a, ajudem os menos favorecidos a se encontrarem como pessoas. Deus existe no momento em que vc está harmonicamente em paz contigo mesmo e com o ambiente que o cerca. E pelos que sabemos o fanatico sofre, por querer de todas as formas fazer imperar o seu pensamento. As formulas inventadas de comunica??o com Deus, indicam que alguem quer ser superior ao seu proximo, isso n?o existe, somos todos capazes de executar qualquer tarefa, basta querer. Um troglodita comunicava com Deus, e assim todos os que o sucederam tambem o fizeram. Tudo é de uma simplicidade infinita. Mas o fanatico nasceu impedir essa paz.

Até mesmo os pecadores n?o s?o perseguidos, mas pagaram por cada ato cometido, da lei de Deus ninguém foge.
bzBsCvvnaa	Magnus, aprendi q o tempo de deserto na nossa vida, é gente q determina, parece loucura, mas é maior realidade, Deus tirou o povo de Israel do Egito, lá eles “tinham do bom e melhor”, mas eram escravos, Deus fez através de Moíses o mar se abrir, para eles passarem e ficarem livres da escravid?o, duraria a caminhada apenas 11 dias, para chegarem até Cana? a terra prometida, onde emanava leite e mel, porém durou a caminhada 40 anos, pq ? pq Deus ? estava com eles, errado, pq Deus ? ouvia suas ora??es errado, pq? P q murmuravam, sempre q murmuramos, lembramos do Egito(passado) as coisas andam de ré. Deus quer te aben?oar, mas p isso vc tem q parar de olhar p as circustancias e olhar somente p Ele , glorificar e ir p frente.<br>  Vou contar minha história, sei o q vc esta passando, pois só ? passei fome, pq fiz o q acabei de te falar, já estava convertida a uns 5 anos, Jesus trocara o pulm?o de minha filha q estava desenganada pelos médicos,qdo me converti. A Igreja q vou é do Evangelho Quadrangular,a 10 anos, pois bem, meu marido resolveu fazer uma sociedade com um “irm?o”da igreja, pois ele tem mto conhecimento em transporte e de entrega na gde Spaulo.montaram uma transportadora rápida. Compraram uma fiorino e um caminh?o q esqueci o nome agora, e tinha mais 2 carros o nosso e do irm?o, pois bem, no 1o mês, fui eu quem cuidou da contabilidade, já de inicio a transportadora pagou todas as despesas e deu p cd um 950,00, que ben??o, no mês seguinte esse irm?o disse q ele faria a contabilidade, pois tinha problema de ler no bra?o, já estava aposentado por isso, blá,blá,blá, como o negócio do meu marido é ? discutir e só trabalhar, eu o chamo de camelo humano, nunca vi alguém trabalhar tanto, p ele ? hora, ? tem chuva ou sol, pediu ele vai, pois bem, meu esposo ficou com a parte de vizitar as empresas e fazer os fretes, e o irm?o de receber e fazer a contabilidade, passaram se 3 meses dinheiro na minha casa ? entrava, o irm?o colocou piso na casa dele, trocou o carro, instalou som/cd , pois insulfilme, e na minha casa nem dinheiro p o supermercado vinha, a luz ? foi cortada pq o pastor pagou, vai vendo, comecei a gritar com meu marido, vc faz frete todos os dias, marca tudo o q vc ta fazendo e pede presta??o de contas, mas o aben?oado só sabe trabalhar, ? marcava pois disse q ? dava p parar p fazer isso q o irm?o tava fazendo, e q ele ? ia pisar na bola, pedi p ele ent?o pedir dinehiro p eu ir ao supermercado, sabe o q aconteceu? O irm?o foi e comprou o q ele quis e mandou entregar na minha casa, esse foi a gota, no outro dia era domingo,falei p meu esposo ir até na casa dele conversar, chegou lá uma baita de uma churrascada, o meu esposo virou e veio embora, pois o irm?o dizia q ? dava p dar dinheiro pq ? tava entrando, virei na segunda eu fui até lá, pedi todos os papéis q tinha p receber p somar,<br>  Só naquela semana, tinha sido feito 4.500,00 em frete, daí ele disse q nós tínhamos roubado ele, falou p o pastor p a igreja, disse q tínhamos sujado o nome dele , e como provar se quem cuidava de tudo era ele, o meu esposo só fazia a pte bra?al, sei q demos o nosso carro p ele, mesmo assim falou q devíamos p ele ainda, nos ame?ou , e mesmo assim continuamos firme com Deus. Orando e indo aos cultos, Num belo domingo veio um missionário o Zaqueu do RJ, moro no interior de SP, come?ou a pregar derepente olha p o meu marido e come?a, Deus manda te dizer q .... e contou tudo q estava acontecendo, e p onde tinha ido todo o dinheiro, e pq tinha acontecido tudo aquilo, a igreja glorificava, o pastor e os obreiros pulavam de alegria em cima do púlpito, esse irm?o estava presente junto c  a família dele todos queriam virar avestruz, saíram da igreja e nunca mais voltaram, Deus tem um propósito em tudo q acontece na vida daqueles q o ama e o busca verdadeiramente, nos levantamos, foi fácil ?, teve dia q só tinha polenta p dar p as crian?as, até Deus abrir as portas de um emprego p meu marido, mas Deus nunca nos desamparou, tinha dia q eu ? conseguia orar, só genia, e a bíblia diz q o Espírito Santo ora por nós com gemidos inexprimíveis, nesse período veio q eu ia perder a casa pois estava com uma divida ativa de IPTU q com juros chegava a 8.000,00. meu marido tinha uma kombi velha q fazia frete de vez enquando  vc ? acredita caia a roda na rua e ele amarava c arame, mas mesmo assim pegava frete p SP, tinha fundido o motor no dia anterior , ? tinha nada na despensa e a luz estava vencida, meu marido deu aquela desanimada, parecia q quando ia se afirmar tudo desabava, eu disse p ele, vamos orar q Deus vai arrumar hoje 10000,00 p pagarmos tudo, ele ficou meio assustado, dobramos o joelho e orei a Deus, - O Senhor é o dono do ouro e da prata, me tirou do Egito , da escravid?o q vivia no mundo, agora somos seus filhos, te amamos, ? há outro Deus em nossas vidas, sei d q o Sr é capaz de fazer, nunca lhe pedi dinheiro, mas hj quero 10.000,00 p pagar e disse o q precisava pagar. Em Nome de Jesus. E falei ao meu marido agora vc vai na Prefeitura q ta tudo resolvido, ele disse já fui varias vezes nem falar eles ? falam, eu disse vai q ta tudo resolvido, ele foi passou +ou – 1 hora , ele voltou sorrindo, me levaram na sala do prefeito, retiram todos os juros a divida caiu p 1.500,00 e vamos pagar 50,00 por mês., daí algumas horas bate na minha porta um outro irm?o da igreja e diz eu estava orando e Deus pediu p eu vim ajudar vcs, manda consertar o  motor da kombi q eu pago e me ajuda aqui tirou do porta malas do carro uma compra q deu p mais de um mês, tinha até danone p as crian?as, carne, tinha de tudo, eu só chorava e glorificava a Deus, e o irm?o disse tem mais uma coisa q preciso fazer, vcs t?o com contas de luz atrasada , disse sim, ta aqui o dinheiro p pagar.<br>  Esse é o Deus maravilhoso q eu sirvo, você pode estar dentro da fornalha acesa, mas o fogo ele ?  deixa te queimar, mas p isso a sua vida tem q estar nas m?os dele totalmente,<br>  N?o desista, vá até a Igreja entregue-se totalmente a Ele. Como lhe escrevi ontem, fa?a a sua parte, e descanse buscando a Ele em 1o lugar q as demais coisas lhe ser?o acrescentadas, ? murmure mais, creia somente, sei q ? é fácil, mas se assim fizer<br>  Se crerer veras a glória de Deus. Em Nome de Jesus. ? deixe o diabo te colocar p baixo como tem feito, falando ao seu ouvido palavras de desanimo, levante lute, vc ouviu a can??o q lhe mandei.<br>  Jesus te ama, basta vc ir a seu encontro q todos os seus problemas Ele vai resolver, antes de ficar em casa ouvindo palavras de desanimo a seu ouvido vá para Igreja onde só Jesus é adorado.

Até quando esconderás de mim o teu rosto?” <br>  <br>  Deus promete-nos fortaleza quando necessitamos. A Bíblia diz em Colossenses 1:11-12 “Corroborados com toda a fortaleza, segundo o poder da sua glória, para toda a perseveran?a e longanimidade com gozo; dando gra?as ao Pai que vos fez id?neos para participar da heran?a dos santos na luz.” <br>  <br>  Quando desistimos, frequentemente perdemos o melhor que Deus tem para oferecer. A Bíblia diz em 2 Coríntios 4:16-17 “Por isso n?o desfalecemos; mas ainda que o nosso homem exterior se esteja consumindo, o interior, contudo, se renova de dia em dia. Porque a nossa leve e momentanea tribula??o produz para nós cada vez mais abundantemente um eterno peso de glória; pelo contrário, rejeitamos as coisas ocultas, que s?o vergonhosas, n?o andando com astúcia, nem adulterando a palavra de Deus; mas, pela manifesta??o da verdade, nós nos recomendamos à consciência de todos os homens diante de Deus.” <br>  <br>  Quando os nossos cora??es nos condenam, n?o devemos desistir. A Bíblia diz em 1 Jo?o 3:19, 20 “Nisto conheceremos que somos da verdade, e diante dele tranqüilizaremos o nosso cora??o; porque se o cora??o nos condena, maior é Deus do que o nosso cora??o, e conhece todas as coisas.”|`|6wtJ0evLaa	Procure ajuda profissional, um psicólogo, alguém para conversar.

Evolution by natural selection is indeed a fact.  No matter how many people believe in it or don't believe in it.  The evidence is clear and unambiguous.

In evolution there is no princess, no frog and no stinkin' kiss, but poof after a few million years a prince.     Truth is there is tons of fossil evidence that denies evolutionary views, but it is ignored or called an anomaly.  Watch Ben Stein's 'Expelled' to see what happens to those who do not dote on evolutionary theory.  Do a little homework, check the 'scientific' dates of various alleged human ancestors.  You will find there is no 'process' of evolution.    It is also arguable that there has been more fraud perpetrated in the realm of human evolution than in any other area of evolution.  See 1977 National Geographic which depicts the evolution of man with primitive man being darker and hairier than modern man.  Modern man looks just like a white anglo saxon protestant.  And this is in a magazine for the liberal intelligentsia.  Also see Peking Man, Neanderthal man and Piltdown man.    If macro evolution were true alleged scientists would not have to perpetrate fraud to promote their view.  Give me the thumbs down, but do consider thinking.  And 'Welltraveled' is close to correct in writing that evolution by natural selection is true.  True.  But, take note, natural selection adds NO new genetic materials.  Natural selection sorts the genetic material present.  Only mutation and abiogenesis produce new genetic material and are therefore the needed 'machine' of evolution.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	You're seriously suggesting that the terminally dumb actually should start using their brains?

56fbf9e2ad11311388e87fd2cbc369baaa	Vamos lá batalhar por mais dois pontinhos e quem sabe até mais. <br>  <br>  CRENTE: crente é o que Jesus mandou que f?ssemos. Jesus disse: n?o sejam incrédulos, sejam crentes. Crentes em quem? Nele,claro. Jesus veio pregar a verdade e ele é a verdade. Logo, é para se crer nele. <br>  <br>  PROTESTANTE: para se entender o que é ser protestante, tem de ler a história da reforma religiosa. Por ora, basta saber que os príncipes da Alemanha protestaram contra um edito do papa e daí vieram a ser chamados de protestantes. <br>  <br>  EVANGéLICO: a igreja evangélica vem do protestantismo, a fé é a mesma, a Bíblia é a mesma. O evangelismo, porém, tem um modo diferente de seguir. O movimento evangélico surgiu nos EUA. A igreja evangélica é mais recente. <br>  <br>  CRIST?O; crist?o foi o nome que as pessoas da antiga Antioquia deram aos seguidores de Cristo. Dessa forma, crist?o abarca ser protestante, evangélico, católico. Até o espiritismo linha branca se diz crist?o. Porém, crist?o quer dizer PESSOAS DE CRISTO. E para ser uma pessoa de cristo, tem de crer nele e obedecer a seus ensinamentos. Tá esclarecido?|`|8C8haQrpaa	Crente - Por defini??o, todo aquele que crê em algo ou em alguém. Durante muitos anos foi usado para definir os que eram n?o-católicos. Depois de algum tempo tornou-se um termo com conota??o pejorativa.<br>  <br>  Protestante - O nome é derivado do movimento iniciado por Lutero, o qual n?o pretendia iniciar uma nova religi?o, mas sim reformar alguns conceitos na Igreja Católica, porém a coisa saiu de seu controle e uma nova religi?o foi criada, dando espa?o a várias outras a seguir.<br>  <br>  Evangélico - Por defini??o, todo aquele que crê no evangelho, assim sendo, os católicos e qualquer outra religi?o que creia no evangelho seria também evangélico. é o nome atualmente pelo qual a maioria se refere aos protestantes. Hoje tem conota??o pejorativa.<br>  <br>  Crist?o - Por defini??o, é todo aquele que crê em Cristo, independente de religi?o. Isso engloba católicos, protestantes, e espíritas.

Portanto seria um pejorativo às avessas.<br>  <br>  Crist?o é todo aquele que cre na divindade de Jesus Cristo, portanto aí se enquadram os evangélicos, católicos, espíritas e umbandistas.

Q6YL8LNRaa	This is very good point.   In my personal opinion, the trends over the past view years have been "who can find the most successful diet" or calorie counting, fat free everything.  I think it really was the IN thing at the time, but just like every other fad, it slowly disappeared.  Many obese men and women see these misleading ads glorifying their product as a miracle and the ability to slim down using just that product. Most of them dont read the fine print at the bottom of the screen admitting that it only really works with diet and excerise.  America's attitude is "get it, and get it now".  These people get that mentality thinking im going to get slim in 2 weeks, no biggie. Millions of people do not find the success they want, therefore, the tables are turned and theyre trying to convince themselves that being thick and accepting really is the thing.  It rediculous to think that this would ever be attractive, but we all know the "fad followers" out there.   Give it time, the next IN thing is going to be staying fit and active again.

I hope that I can shake a few people into common sense about how fallible these guys are even tho they claim "infallability."<br>  <br>  I don't think I am "saved" or anyone else for that matter. We are here to learn what we can and teach when we can. God will absorb us into the consciousness when we are able to be with THEM in a non-corrupting way. The Catholic Church calls this the "communion of saints." They say we only get one chance in one life. I think we get many opportunities to improve our knowledge and emotions so we can exist in God.<br>  <br>  Faith and proof are contras - not connected. Proof may shatter faith, but true faith does not require proof.<br>  <br>  Lets say James Cameron's "tomb of Jesus" theory is proven true. Finding the bones of Jesus is not that far-fetched. They have the bones of Kayaphis (sic?) the priest who sentenced Jesus. If they find Jesus's bones, a principle tenant of Catholic faith would go in the dumpster. It would not bother me at all because I honor Jesus as a prophet and teacher. His bones' existance on Earth would not bother my faith at all.<br>  <br>  The Mayan calendar may stop at 2013 because Mayan civilazation stopped 500 years ago when Spanish rule replaced it. We just put another year in our computerized calendar. They would have had to carve a new stone. their calendar filled the stone. The date it ends has more to do with the date they started it and the size of the rock more than the end of the world.<br>  <br>  I visited Mayan ruins north of Yucatan. Mayan natives are living everywhere down there. They look just like the faces on the stone carvings except they are maybe sitting on a milk crate reading a newspaper of leaning across the hood of an Americano convertible chatting with a pretty girl instead of carving calendar stones. They don't look too worried the old calendar stops at 2013.|`|6WWZWR7baa	My wife is heavy in to the whole chruch thing.

If you believe, good for you (I'm sure that in your own mind, you're saved)... <br>  <br>  It doesn't really matter if 'faith' is as strong as 'proof'.  They are generally in two seperate camps.  One (faith) denotes a blind following with complete obeying and no questioning.  The other (proof) denotes questioning, a quest for the truth, and an open mind.  <br>  <br>  As for the 2013 thing, don't worry about it.  If the end of the world comes, there is nothing we can do about it.  If the world ends, it ends.

BUT, if one step out on faith, seek God and build a relationship with God, one will discover that their experience and relationship with God is all the proof they need to know that there is a one and truly only one God. <br>  <br>  God's Peace Be With You.|`|uWeBj6eJaa	Realise your self before that.

Take care and may God bless!|`|AA10072245	I'm sorry you had to go through all of that. <br>  <br>  The word you are looking for is forgivness.  I'm not saying you are in the wrong at all.  But Jesus did say we had to forgive others as He did.  So He actually does expect us to forgive everything.  If you don't, you are holding on to unforgivness, and that is a sin.<br>  <br>  I know that is alot to ask.  I cannot say I have experienced as much as you, but I have experienced alot too.  I learned through my experience, that it is perfectly natural to feel hurt and angry, but to be able to forgive all of that is something we need God for.  In my case I had to make the choice to say, "God, I forgive _________ for _________, Please help me.  Take this anger and hurt away.  I lay it at your feet."  God is faithful.  So many times when I gave it to Him, He took the anger away completely and healed the hurt and everything.  Of course I'm not perfect and there have been those times I picked the anger back up again.  It is not an easy thing.  But God is always faithful.  He loves us more than we can imagine and is right there where we are.  He will work with us and He will take all that we are willing to give up to Him. But God's also a gentleman. If we are not willing to forgive or give the hurt to Him, or if we choose to hold on to it, He will not force us to do anything. So the choice is yours.  <br>  <br>  I know it's hard and alot. It might be more than I personally can understand and it might be bigger than me and you.  But just remember nothing is bigger than God. There's nothing He can't handle or do.  It's not about what you (or anyone else can or cannot handle or bear.  It's about faith.

This is also commonly referred to as "inner-healing."  When you have been through years of damaging circumstances such as you have, it is difficult in the aftermath because you want to do what is right, but you have these deep wounds in your soul that keep surfacing in your actions.  This is not uncommon these days.  There is help available through Christian prayer-counselling.  It's really a matter of finding someone who has the stuff (so to speak).  There are many Christian counselors out there, who may be well meaning but don't really know how to get you the help that you need.  Ultimately, you are going to need a lot of time with someone that is caring and that can show you the unconditional love of Father God.  Someone that you can open up to and share all of your stuff with, that won't judge or condemn, but will pray for you and with you.

Most people are not aware of the influence that the spirit realm has on their lives. All evil in this world is a direct result of Satan and the demonic realm. Ephesians tells us that our battle is not against flesh & blood (people) but rather spiritual forces. <br>   At times, when I get angry,  I pray against the enemy of our  souls useing the weapons of our warfare and it gets pretty intense. <br>  God truly desires to heal you from all your hurts and disappiontments. Forgiveness is a vital key. You must forgive those who have wronged you. As Jesus said " Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do".  If any of this is speaking to you, you may email me for any further details.  I am speaking from my own experience.
Eeyy1iIRaa	I married a Native American... and one of my sons has married a girl from Trinidad whose parents are Indian.  She was raised in the Hindu Culture and her mother had a Hindu Radio Show here in the U.S.A   I had studied Hindu in College but having all these Indian relatives and experiencing their culture and religion first hand doesn't compare to what information I got from books<br>  <br>  Indian people are very attractive and very passionate about whatever it is they believe....if they are Hindu or Christian they are usually very knowledgable about their beliefs.   The culture is very different when it comes to women and men.  If your future husband is Hindu... you might be in for a shock if you are used to being treated equal among your peers.   It seems to me that in the Hindu religion, women are expected to be very attractive and available at all times for the men.  They are also expected to keep a beautiful house and cook constantly and be a perfect hostess...while looking beautiful.   They seem to manage this...but it is stressful to see how they seem to be objectified...  almost like a trophy for the man...

Era mais frequente que fosse feito a pessoas já falecidas, sem o "perd?o de seus pecados", pois só os mais abastados tinham seus confessores sempre a m?o e rapidamente.<br>  O dízimo é uma interpreta??o do costume judaico de dar a décima parte de seus ganhos ao templo. A meu ver, jesus aboliu totalmente está odiosa prática do dízimo.<br>  Dízimo e venda de indulgências s?o coisas diferentes realmente, mas ambas fortemente imorais e conflitantes com o real espírito crist?o. Lutero n?o foi o único reformista, pois Italo Calvino e outos contemporaneos como ele, "aderiram" ( n?o agiram coordenadamente) ao que se chamou de maneira generalizante de "reforma protestante". Mas grande parte das igrejas ditas protestantes, deriva de anglicanos emigrados para os EUA, que acabaram fundando novas deriva??es, e que n?o s?o poucas.<br>  Na verdade, como na Inglaterra , o sucesso das divis?es da religi?o crist? dependia muito mais da conveniência política do que da fé, uma vez que se os príncipes ou reis de uma regi?o n?o desejassem a separa??o, simplesmente jogavam seus exércitos e trucidavam os "hereges", como foi feito com os cátaros.<br>  Mas os protestantes em geral tem a infeliz característica de usar muito o velho testamento como instrumento de terror para angariar fundos, da mesma maneira que a igreja católica usava o medo de que seu ente querido falecido fosse ao inferno, para extorquir dinheiro de TODAS classes sociais ( cobravam segundo a posse de cada um).<br>  Por isso que sou ateu. é muito mais barato ir para um suposto inferno, por causa de desagradar um suposto deus, sem sustentar a barriguinha gorducha dos clérigos em geral.|`|NeOWERf8aa	As indulgências s?o concedidas apenas depois do pecado ter sido perdoado. A má aplica??o delas, foram uma das causas primordiais que provocaram a ruptura do padre católico Lutero com o papa. Foi apoiado pela elite rural afim de se apoderarem das terras da igreja, na Alemanha, acumulada durante a idade média quando os latifundiários entregavam as terras aos mosteiros em troca de prote??o ao viverem dentro dos muros destas fortalezas.<br>  Exemplos bíblicos de como a pena temporal deve ser paga podem ser vistos no fato de Davi, culpado por homicídio e adultério, mesmo depois de perdoado, teve como pena a morte de seu filho; também temos Moisés e Aar?o que, n?o obstante serem perdoados por Deus, tiveram que sofrer a pena de n?o entrar na terra prometida.|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	Evangélicos<br>  Nos países anglo-sax?es, onde a Reforma Protestante eclodiu no século XVI, o termo "evangélico" é usado para definir quase todas as doutrinas crist?s protestantes. Na Alemanha, ber?o do luteranismo, seu uso chega a ser mais específico: é comum se referir aos membros da Igreja Luterana como evangélicos, excluindo-se o resto dos protestantes. Já no Brasil, quando se fala de evangélicos, trata-se de uma forma genérica de se referir às correntes protestantes pentecostais e neopentecostais (veja abaixo), surgidas somente no século XX. De forma simplificada, pode-se dizer que todo evangélico é protestante, mas nem todo protestante se considera evangélico.<br>  <br>  Protestantismo Histórico<br>  Movimento iniciado na Europa no século XVI, cujo marco célebre s?o as 95 teses do teólogo crist?o Martinho Lutero criticando uma série de práticas e doutrinas da Igreja Católica. Ao romper com o Vaticano, Lutero desencadeia a Reforma Protestante, que culmina com a funda??o de correntes crist?s dissidentes, como a própria Igreja Luterana, a Calvinista e a Metodista. A maioria das igrejas protestantes rejeito o culto a Maria e aos santos e o celibato clerical, além de admitir práticas como o divórcio e os métodos anticoncepcionais. <br>  <br>  Protestantismo Pentecostal<br>  Corrente que aparece nos Estados Unidos nos primeiros anos do século XX, entre fiéis metodistas insatisfeitos com a falta de fervor em suas igrejas. Devido aos cultos vibrantes, marcados por express?es de êxtase e fortes emo??es, n?o demora a se difundir pelos EUA, e posteriormente por países mais pobres, especialmente na América Latina. Em linhas gerais, os pentecostais acreditam em aspectos milagrosos da fé, como o poder de cura do Espírito Santo, e enfatizam a prega??o do Evangelho aos n?o convertidos. A maioria das igrejas pentecostais cobra dízimo de seus fiéis<br>  <br>  Protestantismo Neopentecostal<br>  Fen?meno surgido a partir dos anos 1970, que se difere do pentecostalismo tradicional especialmente por estimular o fiel a buscar a prosperidade em lugar da gra?a. Seus rituais espetaculosos, que n?o dispensam curas milagrosas e exorcismos, n?o escondem o fato de que grande parte das igrejas neopentecostais n?o s?o muito rígidas no que diz respeito aos hábitos e costumes de seus fiéis. Algumas delas mantém forte presen?a na mídia eletr?nica, controlando a programa??o (quando n?o as finan?as) de centenas de emissoras de rádio e televis?o Brasil afora.<br>  MAIORES GRUPOS NO PAíS: IGREJAS PENTECOSTAIS <br>  <br>  Assembléia de Deus*<br>  Funda??o: 1910<br>  História e doutrina: A maior igreja pentecostal brasileira surgiu em Belém (PA), sob a influência de dois missionários suecos vindos dos Estados Unidos, onde freqüentavam a Igreja Batista. Organizada nos moldes das igrejas pentecostais que surgiam ent?o naquele país, a Assembléia de Deus acredita no poder supremo do Espírito Santo e prega com ênfase o Evangelho crist?o. Nos cultos, fiéis oram e cantam em voz alta dentro dos templos.<br>  Fiéis no Brasil: 8.500.000<br>  Templos: Dados n?o disponíveis<br>  Número médio de fiéis que freqüentam cada templo: Dados n?o disponíveis<br>  <br>  * Este número diz respeito apenas à primeira Assembléia de Deus, surgida em Belém (PA) no início do século XX. Trata-se da denomina??o ligada à Conven??o Geral das Assembléias de Deus no Brasil (CGADB), a quem pertence a patente do nome no país. Ao longo do século, outras Assembléias de Deus surgiram, a maioria sem qualquer liga??o institucional com a CGADB.<br>  <br>  Congrega??o Crist? no Brasil<br>  Funda??o: 1910<br>  História e doutrina: Fundada no Brasil por Luigi Francescon, um protestante italiano. No início, cresceu dentro da comunidade de imigrantes italianos do país, para, a partir da década de 1930, se expandir para o resto do Brasil. A exemplo da Assembléia de Deus, centra suas cren?as nas virtudes do Espírito Santo, sem dar valor a outras figuras consagradas historicamente pelo cristianismo, como Maria ou os santos.

Interrogou ent?o, sofregamente, o anjo ali de guarda:<br>  <br>  - Est?o aí os protestantes?<br>  - N?o, aqui n?o se encontra um protestante sequer.<br>  - Que me dizes?! Os protestantes, n?o alcan?aram a salva??o mediante o sangue de Cristo?!<br>  - Já lhe disse e repito: n?o há aqui protestantes.<br>  - Ent?o, será que aqui estejam os católicos-romanos, os membros daquela Igreja que abjurei?<br>  - T?o pouco conhecemos aqui os filhos dessa igreja; n?o existem aqui romanos.<br>  - Estar?o, quem sabe, os partidários de Maomé ou de Buda?<br>  - N?o est?o, nem uns, nem outros.<br>  <br>  Intrigado, indagou ent?o o instituidor da Reforma Protestante:<br>  - Dar-se-á, acaso, que o Céu se encontre desabitado?<br>  - Tal n?o acontece – tornou serenamente o anjo. – Incontáveis s?o os habitantes da casa do Pai, ocupando todas as suas múltiplas moradas.<br>  - Dize-me, ent?o, depressa: quem s?o os que se salvam, e a que igreja pertencem na Terra?<br>  - A todas e a nenhuma – aclarou por fim o guardi?o da entrada das Celestes Moradas. – Aqui n?o se cogita de denomina??es, nem de dogmas. Os que se salvam s?o os que visitam as viúvas e os órf?os em suas afli??es, guardando-se isentos da corrup??o do século. Os que se salvam s?o os que procuram aperfei?oar-se, corrigindo-se dos seus defeitos, renascendo todos os dias para uma vida melhor. Os que se redimem s?o os que amam o próximo e renunciam ao mundo, com suas fascina??es. S?o os que porfiam, transitando pelo caminho estreito, juncado de espinhos: o caminho do dever. Os que se purificam s?o os que obedecem à voz da consciência, e n?o os reclamos do interesse. Os que conquistam a Divina Gra?a s?o os que trabalham pela causa da Justi?a e da Verdade, que é a Causa de determinadas agremia??es com títulos e rótulos religiosos. Os que aspiram à glória de Deus, ao bem comum, à felicidade coletiva. Os que se salvam...<br>  <br>  Basta! - Atalhou Lutero.

Sua compara??o está correta. A bíblia também. Lutero combateu uma arrecada??o que estimulava a desafiar a fé e n?o era para se apossar dos dízimos  e sim era uma venda de "produtos". Agora os líderes protestante se apossam do dízimos e isto é diferente, isto é roubo e Lutero combatia o engana??o aos mais simples na cren?a. Eu diria que o roubo é pior, pois os dízimos est?o destinados na bíblia aos póbres e n?o para salários, constru??es e enriquessimentos eclesiásticos. E defraudar o direito dos nescessitados é roubo. Salom?o quando construiu o templo o construiu com dinheiro de oferta o que n?o é roubo. E os sacerdotes que se apossam do diereito dos pobres para outros afins é roubo e o dízimo é pessoal, é vc quem deve administrá-lo e n?o pode ser doado em dinheiro, o dinheiro no templo é q mata Jesus (30 moedas..). A por??o dos sacerdotes n?o é o dízimo, segundo a bíblia quem se apossa  dos dízimos é ladr?o e os ladr?es n?o entrar?o no reino dos céus. Ajudar os outros com o dinheiro de outros é fácil, "me dá todo o seu dinheiro que eu dou aos póbres e ainda sustento a igreja", é muito fácil dizer que é servo de Deus assim. Vc deve pessoalmente provar que ama quem tá precisando de algo, Jesus disse; "os vossos pobres sempre tereis convosco", eu tenho os meus e cada um tem os seus e assim é provado se eu os abandonei ou n?o, ou n?o quis ir até eles e mandei outro ajudar por mim usando o dinheiro, e isto n?o é amar verdadeiramente, a m?e que ama ela mesma quer cuidar do filho pessoalmente. Ele mesmo veio aqui por amor e n?o mandou ninguém em seu lugar e nem pagou para isto!. N?o dê dinheiro, fa?a  caridade vc mesmo como prova do verdadeiro amor por este alguém! Fuja dos ladróes! Se um cego guiar outro cego ambos estar?o condenados, n?o siga o que eles pregam. Isto tudo tem referências bíblicas, mas deixa pra lá. Mais um detalhe... "já haviam crentes naquela época e em todo o tempo da história e Lutero simplesmente se curvou a forma em que os crentes criam em Deus e por isto se originou o termo protestantes, mas n?o era nada inédito e os crentes sempre pregaram contra tudo isto a muito tempo antes e n?o se origináram devido a nenhum ex-católico como a alguns querem dizer e sim pelos ensinamentos de Jesus a mais de 1300 anos antes.

Si te pasa eso es que te sentís insegura de vos misma.<br>  Estás pensando en que te acepten, en qué van a pensar de lo que decís, de cómo estás vestida, de cómo te movés, y así te perdés en tus pensamientos y no podés concentrarte en lo que realmente querés decir.<br>  Es mejor no decir nada que decir cualquier pavada para zafar. Ahora si no queda más remedio, unos consejos:<br>  Hablá despacio y fuerte, no a los gritos, pero firme. No abras la boca hasta que tengas claro lo que querés expresar. Pensá siempre que los demás también están nerviosos. No importa si son de otra clase o nivel social, jamás pienses que tu interlocutor es superior. Tenés que pensar que lo tuyo vale, tanto o igual que lo de los demás.<br>  Cuanto más te apabulles peor vas a estar. Vos tranquila, nadie es mejor que vos, no le debes nada a nadie, nadie es el due?o del lugar (ni siquiera el due?o de casa), si estás ahí por algo es, entonces primero escuchá y cuando tengas algo que decir, lo decís no importa lo que piensen.

Lo que produce los nervios es enfrentarse ante un público, y ningún ensayo o preparación previa  nos previene contra eso. Existen   numerosas técnicas para ayudar al expositor a superar el miedo escénico. Una muy efectiva es pensar que nadie en el auditorio sabe más que tú sobre el tema de cual vas a hablar. Eso es cierto en más de un 90% de las veces, pero lo importante es que te lo creas de verdad. Otro punto es el contacto visual: Míralos a todos, pero no veas a ninguno en particular. Fijar la mirada en una sola persona, y si esa persona es una figura de autoridad, por ejemplo, tu profesor, incrementa tu nivel de angustia. Pasa tu mirada de uno a otro de tus escuchas. Así, repartes la angustia, y no te dejas influir por alguien en particular. Espero que estas cosas te ayuden.

Una persona no puede tener seguridad y confianza cuando habla de un tema sobre el cual no porta información y dominio.<br>  <br>      Su comunicación no tendría fuerza, proyección, y lucirá mediocre. Un profesional que habla frente a un grupo, siempre está bien preparado. <br>  <br>      Otro elemento importante es ser natural. El inicio debe estar muy bien preparado y tiene que captar la atención del grupo. Usted debe ser usted mismo y tiene que procurar el disfrute de sus conferencias. <br>  <br>      Otra recomendación que me parece fundamental es que no debe tratar de parecer un genio, no debe ser prepotente, ni demasiado inteligente. No sea presumido, puesto que alguien así es rechazado por los auditorios. Los grupos pueden ser más inteligentes que los conferencistas y es imperioso valorarlos y respetarlos. <br>  <br>      Transmita lo bueno que tiene, con sencillez, sin pretender parecer un genio. Sin presumir. <br>  <br>      Hay que establecer sintonía con el grupo y no pensar que usted es muy inteligente y los demás muy brutos. No hay sintonía cuando usted parece decir que es lo máximo y que ellos son mediocres; que tiene un enorme éxito y ellos son fracasados. <br>  <br>      No es bueno caerle mal al auditorio y esto ocurre cuando el orador es presumido. Usted realmente puede ser un genio, pero no debe parecer presumido al comunicar lo que sabe. Hay que hablar con sencillez y dar beneficio con su comunicación. Pienso que la prepotencia rompe la empatía.<br>  <br>  -.-.-.-.-.-.<br>  <br>      ?Por qué las personas que van a hablar frente a los auditorios tienen temor?<br>  <br>      Puede ser por las dudas que tienen frente al tema. Ese temor desaparece cuando la persona gana confianza y seguridad en sí misma, lo cual puede surgir por la preparación y el dominio del tema. Es por eso que uno debe hablar de temas en los cuales se haya ganado el derecho de hacerlo. Hay que ganarse el derecho, encontrar el lado bueno de lo que se va a contar, estar preparados. <br>  <br>      No creo que los nervios desaparezcan del todo, pero si se pueden sentir en el estómago mariposas en lugar de murciélagos. <br>  <br>      Los temores no desaparecen por obra y gracia del Espíritu Santo, pero con la preparación y la práctica cada vez se estará más tranquilo. Uno está vivo y siente nervios. <br>  <br>      No se puede estar fresco como una lechuga. Hay que trabajar para que los temores disminuyan. El temor puede ser dominado, aun cuando no sea eliminado del todo. <br>  <br>  -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.<br>  <br>      ?Usted cree que la persona, entre más practica, más confianza gana?<br>  <br>      Totalmente cierto. <br>  <br>      Hay que tener una actitud positiva frente al reto de hablar en público. Hay que querer hacerlo y hacerlo bien. <br>  <br>      Hay que hablar de lo que se conoce. Si tiene conocimiento, si sabe cómo desarrollará la conferencia, si domina el tema, lo demás es afinar la puntería con algunos detalles. <br>  <br>      Se necesita mucha práctica para lograr habilidad. Y esa práctica debe ser eficiente, es decir, debe servir para mejorar cada día. Es imperioso retroalimentarse, pensar cómo nos fue en esa presentación, qué podemos mejorar, etc. <br>  <br>      Uno puede preguntarle a la gente qué le gustó, qué no le gustó, qué se puede mejorar. Al retroalimentarse, al cuestionarse, al observarse, seguramente la siguiente presentación será mejor, será correcta, tendrá menos errores.|`|HUuTFZ24aa	No conosco a nadie que no le de nervios hablar en publico.

It is a do for yourselves society.<br>  <br>  This was prophesied in the Bible. It says there will be a falling away from the faith before Christ returns. That is our only hope, that Christ returns soon.

Many who call themselves Christians will do things that make all Christians look evil.  Satan works hardest on those he fears most.

We have those in the SF Bay Area and they're great. Besides their little stores, they host book fairs where all these books can be sold for pennies to interested buyers while the proceeds help keep the library strong.    Some used bookstores will allow you to bring in books for "trade" instead of cash. My mom in Florida, who used to burn through paperback novels like kleenex, would buy a bunch of used books, read through them, bring them back, get a trade allowance, get more books, read them, bring them back and so on.    Hope those ideas help.

JPCZCPE1aa	Wow. Really interesting.    I very much doubt that there is any formal published research in this area it is too controversial no one would get funding for it.    It must be very difficult to distinguish between fetish and other social problems at his age. I understand your desire to allow this possible fetish to flourish and not be repressed in a way that will cause him problems in later life but alternatively remember that all children everywhere spend a lot of their time being told not to do various things (such as eating their snot!) and it never seems to do them any harm!    Perhaps you could talk to him about what is appropriate in front of other people...    There is also the possibility that his actions are simply attention seeking and not BDSM. A friend of mine has a son who knows that the way to get what he wants is to bang his own head on the floor so hard that he nearly knocks himself out. My point is that all children have their own oddities. By the age of 11 you should be able to reason with him about what is acceptable behaviour in public. It will not be long before he hits full blown puberty and will be dealing with this and many other issues on his own.    I hope I have helped.    P.S. I was into BDSM from a very young age (certainly younger than 11) and I turned out fine!|`|CDft5bscaa	firstly self harm is not necessarily connected to sexual masochism, cutters for example generally aren't sexually aroused by cutting, its a different sort of release for them    secondly it would be completely inappropriate for you to introduce an 11 year old to the BDSM world regardless of how you're interpreting his behavior, consenting adults is not just a suggestion    thirdly making peace with a fetish is not the only way of dealing with it, some paraphilias are treatable, again thats something for *him* to decide as an *adult*
8IHfytEvaa	God wrote "Honor your Father and Mother" not obey them because of situations like this.    Honoring your Father means different things at different times in your life.    When you are 10, to Honor your Father means to obey him.    Usually.    If a Father wanted to have sex with his 10 year old or 13 year old, it would be time to say "no", to him and report him to the police.    Under the circumstances you have described, it would be best to keep your Father away from your future children and even keep him away from your future bride.    Honoring him in your case means making sure he gets good mental health care.    The number one job of a husband and a father, is once you become a husband and father, is to protect your wife and children.    If your own Father is a threat to their safety, you are right to act accordingly.|`|eEDseQY5aa	ok. i think in this case, you should still honor him. but not in the way you are thinking. i mean honor as in dont put him down. dont talk bad about him. help him be the best he can be. and keep praying for him. and in order to do that and to help him be the best he can be, keep your family away from him. he wont beable to think about doing things to them because he wont get the chance. therefore its taking away the possible chance of him dishonoring himself even more since there is nothing that he can do. be respectful in a polite manner. and think the best of him. but dont give him the chance to get worse or hurt someone else. i hope that some of this makes sense. an example that might make it a little more clear is this  say your a christian kid and one of your parents is drunk and says drink this beer to you. you dont obey them because that is going against Gods will. God is your ultimate father. but you be polite and say no and try to get them out of there so they dont dishonor themselves any more than they already have.   i hope this helps.|`|H7L66ynJaa	First of all honor your mother and father means do not disrespect them. However, you are under a duty to protect you family because you are the head of your household. I would advise that you tell your father why you are not letting him see the children alone but make sure that they see their grandfather but only under your direct supervision.|`|OWXI806qaa	Well the Bible also says that when a man gets married,  he should leave his father & mother & cleave to his wife.  You should respect your father, but that doesn't mean that   you should put your family in danger.  By the way that you talk about your father, it reminds me a lot   of my grandfather.  I would still see him sometimes, but my parents never let me  spend the night at his house or spend very much time with him.  DO NOT feel guilty for protecting your family!  Hope I could help.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Respect is one thing, protecting your family is another.    Respect him but keep him away.

You don't have to like them or even Love them, but you should respect them. As for your present Family, in no way by denying your Father to see them or be around them does this  Disrespect him. If he changes and gets help. that is another story. Stay Strong and Bless you!|`|AA11008046	"..Honor your father and your mother that your days might be ong on the earth.." the Good Book says.  You can honor your parent because of their position over you in your family but you can detest their behavior.  I would suggest letting the children see their grand father in your home and on your time.  also I think I would not want him holding them on his knee.  Having said that the other side of the coin is why did he say these crazy things.  Was he drinking at the times of these utternaces? Is they any valitity to his statements or was he just trying to seem hard core or something.  I believe you probably need to be seriouly cautious with young ones around your father.  I hate to have to say that but one has to admit to possibles and be prepared for them.  Short visits to start with and observe his actions.  Perhaps he has outgrown his ill feelings for others.

Notice, "In the Lord", not outside the Lord.|`|fZGEVA1maa	I am amazed at all of the thumbs down to these good answers.     Honoring your father and mother simply means that you are to respect them.    However, you're now a married man. And our Bible tells us that we are to cleave to our husband/wife.     You have an obligation to your family to protect them. And if the rest of the family is too ignorant to understand that, that's their problem.     The best advice I can give you is this. Take it to God with prayer. Many of us feel that you're doing the right thing. However, you're still having some doubts. Which is why you should take this straight to God. Pray on it and ask Him for His guidance. He will answer, you just have to listen for it.     God Bless & I will include you in my prayers.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Your pastors are correct.  "honor your father and mother" has nothing to do with if they are practicing Christians or not.    In your situation, you would be doing right to protect your family.  "Honoring" your father would mean praying for him and not talking about him maliciously to your family.  If your family were to ask why they do not visit your father, all you would need to say is "i do not think it is best for him or us to visit."|`|zefFTf8Aaa	protecting your kids and honoring father and mother are 2 completely different things. just respect him|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	I was rasied Cathloic and am now an Athiest.

That would be downright stupid. You can respect them without agreeing with everything the say 100%. If that's a lil too hard for you to swallow  flip your bible to Ephesians 6:4 "And ye Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath..." your story sounds like he's provoking you to wrath...the Bible speaks against that.  If you still aren't clear try to find a pastor or an elder at a local church that you can sit and talk with.|`|uCbxZ0vnaa	I think it refers to the fact that yes they gave you life but i think god would understand your situation and wouldn't blame you for being logical and not going along with your father.    Do you really think God would want you to endanger your family just because this is your 'father'.
d06ece240ff558a9716b567752ca5b16aa	Where do you get off saying that "War is a SIN!" ?  It's not.  In the old testement, God directed Israel to go to war.  <br>  <br>  War is an extension of political will.  Plain and simple.  Yes, God is love, but he is also a God of Justice.

(My pastor said so.)|`|14b1b141a15fa601e5fb2ab4555ad1a7aa	Even though I'm not religious, I would say that you need to read the bible or Koran or other religious texts to really understand why god created hell and let us suffer. Christians or Muslims or whoever might be, they will tell you the reasoning behind the creation with the bible as their basic argument. That's why you cannot argue in this way. You just be waisting your time, like I'm doing right now.<br>  <br>  When people believe in god, I do believe that they assume there is god. Atheists, in a same way, assume that there is no god without the evidences that they endure and represent. You may say that there are scientific proofs, but they are mostly theories which came from various scientific reasoning. Unless you can come up with a time travel machine, you may never know. Though, how about if nihilism actually comes in the future? That might be interesting, right? What if science advances enough so no one has to face death? How about living longer and longer?|`|20009384c856f6ca854943446cca9f70aa	Well actually you are right, there is a lot of "my God is better than yours" going around.  In reality the three monotheastic religions have the same God.  It started with Judiasm, then Christianity, then Islam.  Same God though, even though we often separate ourselves through ignorance, hatred, jealousy,mistrust and lies.  This is our sin, our weakness.  It does not mean that God is at fault for this.  He is a loving God, I wish that you could experience this.  He sees the misery, the suffering and he knows that man is the cause for most of it. Can't you agree about that?  He wants us to love one another and to relieve the suffering of our fellow man.  This is true religion----true Islam, true Christianity, true Judiaism.|`|6xOu8xXCaa	You have to love yourself first to understand how God loves.  Love is all good things in the world not just a feeling!|`|om7oslzcaa	I can see why you feel that way but actually it is wicked men and demons that make you feel that way not God.  It is because of the lies they tell about God.<br>  In the bible when Adam sinned he was told "for dust you are and to dust you will return"  the wages of sin is death.<br>  Or Ecc 9:5 The living of conscience that they will die but the dead are conscience of nothing at all.<br>  They make up this hell fire thing.  Jeremiah told how the pagans throw their babies into the fire to sacrifice to this false God.  God exclaimed nothing like this ever came up into his heart to do.  Isn't that what hell is supose to be?<br>  I do not believe there is a hell or that the bible teaches a hell.<br>  But Adam and Eve brought up a very important question, who has the right to tell mankind what to do?<br>  Who does have the right to rule this world?<br>  Satan says no one does but them he takes over mankinds governments and rules them.  You can see by the wars that Satan is ruling the governments of this world.<br>  He is causing the sadness and sorrow.<br>  It is for the Universe, the angels and all the world to see that mankind does not have the ability to rule its self.<br>  But Jesus will one day rule the world the bible says.<br>  He also says "the Meek will inherit the earth"<br>  this earth is beautiful and glorious and it is said in Revelation that God is going to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.<br>  The angels shouted in applause when the earth was created.<br>  One day soon REvelation 20: God will abyss the devil and clean up the earth and mankind will live forever upon the earth.

a5JesB5Paa	Abel's catholic mumbo jumbo about hell being a mystery hits the whole problem of the concept square on the head.   Hell, as taught by the Catholic and protestant churches and others, is simply not a Biblical concept.   If the Catholic Church is 2000 years old, and the original church as they claim, don't you think that they had more than enough time to figure out this "mystery"??<br>  <br>  Hell does not exist. The concept of hell as a place of everlasting torment is not Biblical.  It is a pagan concept adopted by the Catholic chruch and picked up by all her various offshoots (protestant).<br>  <br>  Please read for yourselves the plain truth from the Bible, the wicked will simply die and cease to exist:<br>  <br>  Ro 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord<br>  <br>  Eze 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.<br>  <br>  Eze 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die......|`|10DjXLlWaa	Hell is sin; sin is how sinners live today (in sin); hell is the state of a sinners mind. sinners are tormented in their minds, and moreso today because of the uncertainty that they feel about not believing that there is a GOD. see, we, who know the truth, and live the truth, don't have any worries about what tomorrow will bring, or how we will get food for the family, or go to sleep worrying if we are going to be safe or not. We have GOD watching over us all the time, and He promises to take care of us and keep us from evil, and HE DOES JUST THAT ALL THE TIME, DAY AND NIGHT!|`|3cWRFlTZaa	This is like asking me if I would feel better if I knew for sure that there are no invisible green monsters living in my closet and under my bed.

It works out nicely.|`|bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	Despite rumors to the contrary, hell is still a doctrine in Catholic theology. One who purposely rejects God chooses not to enjoy an eternity of friendship with the Lord. This is the basic notion of hell - cutting oneself off from God.<br>  <br>  The existence of hell or separation from God is very real. However, what form hell assumes or in what manner a damned person will suffer, is open to debate. No one has come back to report the temperature in hell. And no human can judge whether another is damned. <br>  <br>  Theologians suggest that hell be seen as a state of total rejection of God. Like heaven, it is not a place and is not subject to time.<br>  <br>  In grappling with the issue of hell, one needs to remember that it is an issue, which remains in the realm of mystery, a truth not yet entirely revealed.<br>  <br>  Peace and every blessing!|`|53039dc5b545e80e793402ee5fef4353aa	Wouldn't you?

Others say that its a story to show us that if we take our eyes off of Jesus like Peter did, we will allow the cares and the worries of the world overcome us and we will soon be drowning in our problems. and the parable Jesus told of having faith like a mustard seed, meaning we start out small and by going through different trials our faith grows and strengthens. Soon our faith is so strong in Jesus that whatever we ask in the name of Jesus it will be done because of our faith knowing he will answer us.
41ee57b2143cb28d55c42bac1bb058c6aa	I dont think banning ideas is cool but you can ban stuff like:<br>  We should kill the kikes etc.  inciting the general populace to violence is not good.|`|4602256217a739bd3d3962e1c7c5cac4aa	I don't think it is good to hate anyone. But you can invite them over for dinner w/ a little "Menu" mixed in from China.|`|2568d70b908260ad3bc1010b12d59c81aa	It's not really banned in Germany to be a neo-Nazi, although they are not allowed to deny the Holocaust, call for killing of people or display swastika in public they still have a lot of free speech, their party NPD is not banned (it was attempted to ban it, but it was not possible because of free speech, and that party is really very radical), they can make demonstrations and all this. Once a year they march up in my town and the police protects them from the leftists who want to beat them up just to garantee their free speech!! There is always an anti-demonstration, but we can't stop the neo-Nazi demonstrations, because the constitution that they despise so much gives them the right of free speech! <br>  <br>  As for Holocaust denial I can just say that these "academics" simply deliberately lie in order to incite hatred. I see it makes no sense to debate the issue with you as it seems you consider the fact that the Holocaust happened, and to the extend that it did, a "belief". Well, you can believe that the sun rotates around the earth if you wish, same way you can believe that the Holocaust did not happen or that it's extend was less than it was, but you cannot spread hate and insult people in public. There is no secret police in Germany that investigates if there are people who deny the Holocaust in private and punishes them. But the ones who are to be punished are these agitators who call themselves "academics" who have the only goal to incite hate.|`|2tpFyzWwaa	It's funny how, in America, we have groups like the ACLU (which has a lot of Jewish lawyers as members) doing their best to give ppl the freedom to have those kind of groups, but in Europe they ban them.<br>  <br>  I don't think those groups should be banned, but inciting murder or other violent attacks should be....as it already is.<br>  .|`|3MPFkSvjaa	Hold on.

It doesnt matter if someone talks about killing somebody, it only matters when they actually do.|`|3vZsLzRyaa	I personally would say NO, it is not right to ban specific hate groups. As much as the behavior of such groups are distasteful, to be polite; in a free society, even the dissenters need to be able to voice thier opinion, if only to give others the chance to be forwarned of thier measure of insanity.<br>  Banning groups forces them underground, where the claim of persecution can add glamor, and in some cases power to thier form of insanity. And history has already shown what that can lead to. The original Nazis were banned so thier actions, such as robbing banks and clandestine murders were easily absorbed into the practice of the group. Look at the end result of that point in time.<br>   Hidden groups without openess, are more easily empowered to take darker actions and often more prone to those whose only real aim is personal power, the cost of which is always paid for by the membership, and others who are in essence, non-involved persons.<br>   Banning leads to groups like the Aryan nations, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Posse Commitatus. all of whom use the existing laws of an are to create legal chaos by obstructing the system, and them claiming persecution when thier actions get the expected negative response.<br>   By allowing these groups to stay in the light of day, so to speak, it also allows the uninvolved citizenry to keep their eye on these groups actions and allows for much needed debate and discussion when there is a real complaint.<br>   Few people know that one of the original groups to propose both a vote and equal rights under the law (as far as enforcement) for women, was the American Communist Party of the 1930's.<br>   There is another side to the coin as well- banned groups are easy targets for real state-organised persecution, even if the actions are in name at least, for the protection of the populace. Waco Texas, despite the intentions of just checking out claims of arms hoarding, did end up a debacle because some opf the weopns used were more dangerous than thought . Smoke bombs are incendiary devices, and while Waco could be argued as a tragedy of misinformation and ignorance, people still died mostly from the actions of the Federal Government, however ignorant of thier ordinance.<br>   With banned and underground groups, such even foolish and stupid actions become more easily swept under the rug in th name of 'national interest 'or security, so there are two sides to the coin that better supports an arguement for public openness and individual awareness.|`|5Oc3kStTaa	It is very difficult. What constitutes a 'group'? And what constitutes 'hate'. If I organise a group to dissent (using legal methods) against another group such as, say, Tories or Scottish Nationalists etc. am I inciting people to hate? After all, me and my group clearly don't like them otherwise we wouldn't have organised in the first place! The difference, perhaps, between my hypothetical group group and a 'hate' group, is that we do not incite violence and other illegal activities. It is legal in this country to create or belong to groups which legally dissent against the doctrine of multiculturalism (such as the political party British National Party).|`|LIr9uq2faa	WHAT GOOD IS IN THEM COMING OUT OF THEM,NOTHING,WORTH NOTHING ,BUT DEPRESSION AND A SOUL FULL HATE LIVING IN UNHAPPINESS|`|aYDQXuS3aa	We are not heading for a situation where we are only allowed to hold state sanctioned beliefs.

However the government does have a right to make unlawful any actions that an individual or group take against anothers right to pursue happiness. <br>  <br>  For instance, the Klan has the right to march.

Which is understandable because they are racist. My school diverse and I love it. Since 2005 there were 2,000 Black people that have moved over here and now go to my school. I love it! Diversity is way better. <br>  <br>  With Black people moving in to a different location, it is very understandable that there would be some sort of hostility. Seeing new faces and races. That's how most people react, White or Black, to new environments because they want to fit in too. These people might not know how to fit in because they don't want to be rejected by people in this new location.<br>  <br>  Just continue to talk to them to make them feel comfortable and feel wanted.

IvMhqRIOaa	Well do you poo a chicken?
05033678a6548be4f669471c16830ae3aa	HI, Innoncence Lost<br>  <br>           I agree with what you said in regards to hating people<br>           or attacking them for their beliefs. I for one don't hate<br>           anyone for what they believe in, as I have friends that are<br>           of various faiths. The problem that I have with religion in<br>           general is that they all tend to believe without question<br>           that they have the absolute "Truth" and that they only are<br>           "Saved" and everyone else is doomed. And there was<br>           a time in my life when I felt more or less the same.<br>           But It took a tremendous amount of research, years of it, <br>           to come to the realization that no matter what faith you<br>           believe in, no one can make such a claime. And it is<br>           because of these types of beliefs that we are in the state<br>            we are in today. History shows us the blood that has<br>          been shed from all religious adherents, and that means <br>          all of them. Religious Wars are what's making the front<br>          page news every day on a global scale, and why?<br>          Because each nation feels that they were given the<br>          God given right to oblitirate any other nation that does'nt<br>          comply with their so-called "Doctrine of Truth" thereby<br>          "Anathamizing" them, with "Gods Consent" of course.<br>          Also what I've come to realize is that most people will<br>          believe in some doctrine or faith either because it was<br>          taught to them from childhood, or because they won't<br>          even bother to do extensive research into what they<br>          believe simply because of "Blind Faith". If people in<br>          general want to ask questions on Yahoo Answers, fine<br>          but they should'nt go on telling people that they are doom<br>          to die eternally for not being a christian, muslim, or what-<br>          ever. If I were the Creator, I be pretty disappointed with<br>          my creatures seeing that they all claime to love and<br>          honor me, and yet are killing each other off in my name!|`|039863412b2033f40a328e6c2ae2dc51aa	I don't believe in suppressing individual comments, because I feel people should feel free to express themselves - I am an American, this is what I believe.  We should fight vehemently for what we believe or not believe.  We have the right and the freedom to speak and I pray it never is taken away from us.<br>  <br>  What I do have issues with is when one group and their beliefs or non-beliefs lambast & degrade other groups and their beliefs.  Those type of comments hurt the sensitive.<br>  I wish we could express our beliefs with more respect to others.  Also I wish folks would not clog up the question board with foolishness.|`|dVEcNpZfaa	not all do that but some just do|`|pFV9m1ESaa	You need to understand that many people who guide their lives by logic and reasoning, are sick and tired of superstitious hypocrites telling them they are immoral, and that they are going to hell for eternity for simply not believing in their superstition.  Muslims have basically declared war on everyone who doesn't believe in Islam.  They are killing people as I write this.  I have a right to be outraged, and I am just exercising that right.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	It's mostly just the variouis Christians, Muslims and Atheists.

3711cb723ce1005799e7f93966d59f5faa	Secondo la definizione storica degli studiosi inglesi del paganesimo, la magia e' "l'insieme delle pratiche atte a portare forze spirituali e sovranaturali sotto il controllo della volonta' umana" (citazione da Sir James Frazer, tradotta da me).<br>  <br>  Del satanismo non ne so proprio niente, e non ne voglio sapere. Ma la Wicca non ha niente a che fare con il satanismo e nemmeno con il male. La regola della Wicca (il Rede) comanda "che non si faccia del male a nessuno". <br>  <br>  La Wicca non e' soltanto stregoneria - e' una religione, di cui le pratiche magiche fanno una parte. "Religione", secondo Sir Edward Tylor, e' "il credere nell'esistenza di essere sovranaturali e nel bisogno degli essere umani di entrare in rapporti con loro" (la mia traduzione).<br>  <br>  Harry Potter non c'entra niente ... si tratta di puro intrattenimento, per quanto accattivante sia.<br>  <br>  Se vuoi sapere di piu' sulla Wicca, troverai qualche link a dei siti in italiano inseriti in questa mia risposta precedente:<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah._giiaf5xQLj5eXFyrALjxDQx.?qid=20070706135942AAmrwwV">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|nBjw9Yckaa	e il saper recitare una parte e camuffare la realtà con furbizia!|`|D9Arkgxnaa	l'amore|`|JZllqdeLaa	ciò che vedi (non tutto però) e a cui non riesci a dare una spiegazione|`|KV531vaAaa	Beh...io alla mAgiA c kredO ekkOme..<br>  <br>  avEvO kOmpRatO aD uNa miA amikA<br>  <br>  uN liBrO di MagiA "Giovani Streghe"<br>  <br>  kn dentro inkantesimi e altrO..<br>  <br>  <br>  io kosi x provare ho ftt un inkantesim<br>  <br>  d'amore ad uno ke mi piaceva<br>  <br>  ha funzionato...<br>  <br>  -SARà konincidenzaa...??-|`|q2QapCydaa	E una bella cosa che e fatta piu veloce che la nostra vista!:=)|`|dCYOay9Xaa	La magia è tutto quello che fa muovere il mondo.

0f70291541dd2daf3e71aeffcf8b7f7eaa	Excelente respuesta la de "lamoni".<br>  Muy bien fundamentada.<br>  Yo solo agregaría que la homosexualidad fuera del contexto religioso que es una conducta antinatural, fuera de todos los órdenes de la naturaleza y como fué dise?ada, sin entrar en ningun tipo de rollo religioso. Solo hay dos sexos, seudohermafroditas y hermafroditas verdaderos.<br>  Es muy frecuente encontrar como justificación de la homosexualidad el caracter dogmático de las iglesias, de la indole que quieran, o la corrupción de los gobiernos, pero no son mas que distractores.<br>  En si, el trasfondo de la homosexualidad representa uno de los puntos cumbres de la despersonalización humana de nuestros tiempos globalizantes: la falta de madurez y pobre definición de la personalidad, lo que nos lleva a vivir bajo estereotipos como bunker contra las trasngresiones sociales cada vez mas notorias en nuestros dias.<br>  Ayer eran moros, judios, negros los que clamaban reconocimiento, libertad y oportunidad pero ahora las minorias se diversifican en base a conducta, ya no a ascendencia etnica o cultural (además de religiosa).<br>  No asocies religión con homosexualidad porque aunque una contempla a la otra en algun apartado de su devenir, nunca tienen relación ni de causalidad ni de casualidad. Religion y homosexualidad simplemente existen porque el hombre las crea, pero lo que no es permisible es que la creación domine al hombre.<br>  En lo personal estoy convencido que la homosexualidad no debe existir por ser una conducta antinatural, me vale si es antireligiosa o antisocial. Nuesros cuerpos naturales tienen una función reproductiva que en algun momento se vuelve necesidad el instinto. Se debe hacer de la forma correcta, pues Dios o Natura, como le quieras llamar, no juegan a los dados.|`|ZbIz2MYNaa	Si eso en un sentido es como ser racista eso es muy malo es discriminarlos por sus gustos ell@s deberían ser dignos de ser hijos del se?or <br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos =)|`|767058d1c1673729036d27e4fb09f73faa	eso es tan molesto, si las malditas monjas son lesvianas y pederastas igual que los padres<br>  <br>  cada uno es libre de elegir lo que más le conviene|`|OEJ36yC2aa	La homosexualidad no es el pecado imperdonable (Marcos 3:28-30) En 1 Corintios 6 Pablo menciona la homosexualidad como una de las causas para no entrar en el reino de Dios, pero también menciona que eso mismo eran algunos de los corintios. Por tanto, la homosexualidad es un estilo de vida que puede ser abandonado y perdonado. Las personas se condenan por su negativa a aceptar a Cristo como Se?or y Salvador. Si un homosexual acepta al Se?or y se convierte de su estilo de vida es totalmente perdonado y reconciliado con el Dios.|`|hO4TdoH0aa	primero asi fueron als reglas segundo las reglas dicen que va en contra de la naturaleza, veras la maldad en si ( a diferencia de los taoistas) no es el bien contra el mal, si no, una modificacion o mas bien malformacion del bien.  por lo tanto si la religion cristiana considera que la naturaleza es bien y las eyes de la naturaleza lo correcto, entonces si la naturalesa dice hombre y mujer... asi sera no?|`|ksNBmmyDaa	Los homosexuales son tan amados por Dios como los heterosexuales.<br>  <br>  La Escritura dice que ellos tambien estan bajo pecado al igual que todos, y que tambien necesitan de un Salvador.<br>  <br>  El Salvador ya vino, lo mataron crucificandole en una cruz, para que todos aquel que en el crea, homo u heterosexual, no se pierda, màs tenga vida eterna.|`|1tFtSDNMaa	es simple, de CUAL SE?OR?, PERO BUENO, dios es una cosa muy a parte de las teorias religiosas y su sarta de reglas de orden machista y reduccionista que condenan al hombre y mujer, a una cosa, la conceppción.

Mais de 70 por cento da superfície da Terra é coberta com ela. Para se apreciar este tremendo volume líquido é preciso um esfor?o de imagina??o. Imagine, por exemplo, um buraco de um quil?metro de comprimento, um quil?metro de largura e um quil?metro de altura — um quil?metro cúbico. Para encher este cubo de água seriam necessários mais de 900 bilh?es de litros. Agora, multiplique este volume por 1,4 bilh?o de tais quil?metros cúbicos, e chegará perto da quantidade de água existente na Terra. Ela segue seu infindável ciclo a partir dos oceanos, rios, lagos e correntes para a atmosfera, atraída pelo calor do sol, e ent?o precipita-se novamente sob a forma de chuva ou de neve. —?Eclesiastes 1:7.<br>  <br>  Os fatos indicam que existe bastante água na Terra para mais do que satisfazer o desejo de toda coisa vivente, desde a cria??o do homem e por toda a eternidade. (Salmo 145:16) Por que, ent?o, existe a crise de água?<br>  <br>  Portanto, embora exista muita água doce no mundo, sua distribui??o é desigual. Este é o primeiro dos grandes problemas. Por exemplo, segundo cálculos de cientistas, a ásia tem 36% da água que enche os lagos e rios do mundo, mas esse continente abriga 60% da popula??o mundial. Em contraste, o rio Amazonas contém 15% das águas fluviais do mundo, mas apenas 0,4% da popula??o mundial vive suficientemente perto para utilizá-las. Também desigual é a distribui??o de chuvas. Há regi?es da Terra permanentemente secas; outras, embora n?o sejam sempre secas, sofrem estiagens periódicas.<br>  <br>  Muitos especialistas acreditam que os humanos podem causar certas mudan?as no clima, que afetam as chuvas. O desmatamento, o cultivo e pastejo excessivos desnudam a terra. Alguns argumentam que isso faz o solo refletir mais luz solar para a atmosfera. Resultado: o ar esquenta, as nuvens se dispersam e as chuvas diminuem.<br>  <br>  O solo desnudo pode também diminuir as chuvas, pois boa parte da chuva que cai sobre as florestas é de água que se evaporou da própria vegeta??o —?das folhas das árvores e da vegeta??o rasteira. Ou seja, a vegeta??o age como enorme esponja que absorve e retém a água das chuvas. A remo??o das árvores e da vegeta??o rasteira diminui a disponibilidade de água para formar nuvens de chuva.<br>  <br>  Exatamente até que ponto as a??es humanas afetam as chuvas ainda é um tema polêmico; é preciso mais pesquisas. Mas, uma coisa é certa: a escassez de água é ampla. Já amea?a a economia e a saúde de 80 países, alerta o Banco Mundial. E já s?o 40% dos habitantes da Terra —?mais de dois bilh?es de pessoas —?que vivem sem água limpa nem saneamento.<br>  <br>  Diante da escassez de água, as na??es ricas em geral usam seus recursos para evitar o pior. Constroem represas, empregam cara tecnologia para reciclagem da água, ou até mesmo dessalinizam a água do mar. As na??es pobres n?o têm tais op??es. Muitas delas precisam escolher entre racionar a água limpa, que pode inibir o progresso e a produ??o de alimentos, e reutilizar água n?o-tratada, que resulta na propaga??o de doen?as. Como a procura de água aumenta em toda a parte, o futuro parece bem sombrio.<br>  <br>  Um segundo problema agrava a distribui??o desigual de água: o crescimento demográfico faz aumentar a demanda de água. A quantidade de chuvas no mundo inteiro permanece um tanto estável, mas o crescimento demográfico é explosivo. O consumo de água dobrou pelo menos duas vezes neste século, e alguns estimam que poderá dobrar de novo nos próximos 20 anos.<br>  <br>  Naturalmente, uma popula??o cada vez maior exige n?o só mais água potável mas também mais alimentos. Produzir alimentos, por sua vez, exige mais água. E a agricultura precisa competir com as demandas de água da indústria e de particulares. Com a expans?o das cidades e das áreas industriais, a agricultura muitas vezes sai perdendo. “De onde vir?o os alimentos?”, pergunta certo pesquisador. “Como poderemos abastecer 10 bilh?es de pessoas se mal conseguimos abastecer 5 bilh?es, sendo que já estamos desviando água da agricultura?”<br>  <br>  é nos países em desenvolvimento que as popula??es mais crescem e, em muitos deles, a água já é escassa. Infelizmente, esses países têm menos dinheiro e tecnologia para enfrentar os problemas de água.<br>  <br>  Assim, é sábio nutrirmos um conceito equilibrado da água que bebemos. é limitado o que podemos fazer para assegurar sua pureza. O ar que respiramos é bastante poluído para encurtar a vida, em algumas localidades, mas as máscaras contra-gases s?o impraticáveis.<br>  <br>  Assim, ao invés de permitirmos que tais situa??es distor?am nossa perspectiva na vida, devemos ver nelas a prova de que os sistemas humanos falham quando n?o operam em harmonia com os maravilhosos sistemas naturais da terra. Ao mesmo tempo, porém, podemos ter confian?a de que o Arquiteto destes sistemas naturais em breve se certificará de que operem de acordo com seu propósito, quando “arruinar os que arruínam a terra” e suas águas. — Rev. 11:18.<br>  <br>  Daí, as águas da terra sustentar?o a vida sem jamais provocarem dor, doen?a ou morte.|`|NeOWERf8aa	Até...<br>  <br>  (Jo?o 14:26) -  Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.|`|0QuKSKNUaa	Olà gessica você n?o parece ser uma pessoa muito evoluída com a sua critica!

GB56NFtuaa	666?<br>  <br>  6 :Comércio<br>  6: Política<br>  6: Religiao<br>  <br>  666:numero simbolico representando o governo de satanas!|`|BBeIsS8Kaa	é o número da besta, do anticristo.|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	o certo é isso:<br>  <br>  Número da Besta, Marca de Besta, 666, meia-meia-meia, seiscentos e sessenta e seis ou ainda seis-seis-seis, é de acordo com a tradi??o crist?, um número correspondente ao nome da Besta, e que equivale ao 666 (ou 616 em alguns manuscritos).<br>  <br>  O Anti-Cristo<br>  Segundo as Sagradas Escrituras surgirá um líder que governará o mundo por 7 anos. Revolucionará a economia e a política mundial através do seu governo. Influenciará de tal forma a humanidade que todos que o aceitarem ser?o marcados com um número: o 666 (Apocalipse 13:16–18 ). O livro de Apocalipse o chama de Anti-Cristo. Uma das maiores justificativas para seu número ser o 666 é a seguinte:<br>  <br>  6 é o número do homem porque ele foi criado no sexto dia por Deus; <br>  3 é o número de Deus porque Ele é uma Trindade (Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo). <br>  Logo, como 666 é o número seis repetido três vezes pode-se dizer que o Anti-Cristo será um homem (o seis como número do homem) que desejará e se declarará Deus (representado pelo número de três vezes que o seis é repetido).<br>  <br>  Interpreta??es<br>  De acordo com as ramifica??es do Cristianismo há diversas interpreta??es sobre o significado do número.<br>  <br>  Diversos ramos defendem que 666 se relacione ao nome ou título de uma pessoa específica.<br>  <br>  Alguns textos católicos e historiadores defendem que 666 se relacione com Nero César, imperador romano sob a qual o apóstolo Jo?o teria sido exilado. Esta cren?a é baseada no seguinte argumento:<br>  <br>  Nero César (em hebraico ???? ???, Nrwn Qsr "Neron Qesar") assume o seguinte valor no alfabeto hebraico:<br>  <br>                 r    s    q     n   w    r    n <br>         666 = 200 + 60 + 100 + 50 + 6 + 200 + 50<br>  Outra vers?o para o nome de Nero ??? ???, Nrw Qsr (que é a forma latina):<br>  <br>                 r    s    q    w    r    n <br>         616 = 200 + 60 + 100 + 6 + 200 + 50<br>  Ramifica??es evangélicas vêem o valor de 666 associado ao papado, que ostenta em sua tiara VICARIUS FILLIS DEI que equivaleria a 666.<br>  <br>  De acordo com os ebionitas, em hebraico escrevemos 666 com as consoantes T-R-S-W ou TARSO. A tradi??o ebionita defende que 666 designa Paulo de Tarso, que para eles é o responsável pelo surgimento da idolatria crist?.<br>  <br>  Na atualidade, muitos levantam a tese de que o número da besta poderá estar associado ao código de barras ou à tecnologia de chip que seriam implantados nos seres humanos por medidas de seguran?a e controle governamental.

Aquele que tem entendimento calcule o número da besta, porque é número de homem; e o seu número é seiscentos e sessenta e seis.<br>  <br>  A minha bíblia de estudo diz o seguinte:<br>  Como nem a língua grega nem a hebraica possuiam um sistma numérico separado, as letras de seus alfabetos continham valor numérico. Portanto, o simbólico número da besta é a soma dos valores simbólicos das letras de seu nome. O monstro pode ser o último de muitos falsos messias ( ver mateus 24:24; marcos 13:22) a surgir na história que manifeste o espírito do anticristo. Ver 1 jo?o 2:18-19,22;4:3; 2 Jo?o 7.<br>  O drag?o desenvolveu uma trindade forjada em seu conflito espiritual contra a igreja (ver introdu??o a Apocalipse:Conteúdo).

As coisas que dizem por aí sobre quem é a besta, precisamos pesquisar e ficar atentos, pois creio que segundo relatos bíblicos, que se juntarmos tudo que se ouve falar, a besta ou anticristo atualmente faz parte de um sistema muito bem organizado, ou seja, creio que existam atualmente muitas pessoas trabalhando para o anticristo e enganando a muitos.<br>  <br>  O que precisamos fazer creio, que é ficar alertas a tudo e obedientes e protegidos através da palavra de Deus que é a nossa arma contra o inimigo, só assim teremos a certeza de prevalecermos contra esse monstro terrível, que analisando a bíblia creio ser um sistema muito bem organizado que atualmente tem trabalhado para a chegada do anticristo.<br>  <br>  Desse sistema fazem parte cientistas, médicos, religiosos que se dizem crist?os, satanistas, políticos, pessoas que cuidam da nossa seguran?a, etc...Enfim personalidades importantes que influenciam toda uma sociedade... Creio que eles sabem para quem trabalham e fazem isso de s? consciência.<br>  <br>  O ber?o da besta ( anticristo ) está sendo preparado por essas pessoas e desde já fica um alerta elas est?o em toda parte...

Revolucionará a economia e a política mundial através do seu governo. Influenciará de tal forma a humanidade que todos que o aceitarem ser?o marcados com um número: o 666 (Apocalipse 13:16–18 ). O livro de Apocalipse o chama de Anti-Cristo. Uma das maiores justificativas para seu número ser o 666 é a seguinte:<br>  <br>  6 é o número do homem porque ele foi criado no sexto dia por Deus; <br>  3 é o número de Deus porque Ele é uma Trindade (Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo). <br>  Logo, como 666 é o número seis repetido três vezes pode-se dizer que o Anti-Cristo será um homem (o seis como número do homem) que desejará e se declarará Deus (representado pelo número de três vezes que o seis é repetido).|`|ckUzgg8gaa	ola essa pergunta é muito detalhada, mas pode ficar tranquilo pois conhe?o esse site <a href="http://www.sabetudo.net/web" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabetudo.net/web</a>   muito bom para essa sua pergunta.<br>  <br>  <br>  Beijos espero que goste <br>  <br>  me adciona tá|`|yxkaP6ZOaa	O numero 666 sifinifica o numero da  BESTA , O ANTI-CRISTO- NO DIA DO JUIZO FINAL  HAVERá A LUTA DO BEM CONTRA O MAL .

Os católicos n?o podem se deixar levar pelas supersti??es que se originaram ao redor desta data. Para n?o ser enganado é preciso saber o que os números representavam para os antigos judeus. Por exemplo, os 144 mil eleitos (Apocalipse, cap. 14): é o povo crist?o, que n?o aderiu ao culto imperial, permanecendo fiel a Cristo. 144.000 = 12 x 12 x 1000. O número 12 era símbolo da perfei??o e é citado 187 vezes na Bíblia. O número 1000 representava a glória de Deus. <br>  <br>  <br>  O simbolismo do 666 é claramente interpretado pela Igreja. A mentalidade judia afirmava que o número 7 significava a perfei??o e o contato com Deus, e o que estava abaixo era imperfeito, de modo que o número 6 era sinal de imperfei??o, erro. Temos por exemplo os 7 Sacramentos, os 7 dons do Espírito Santo, as 7 dores de Virgem Maria e de S?o José, etc; é um número símbolo de perfei??o. O número 6 repetido quer dizer "perfei??o da maldade" e o autor do Apocalipse identifica a besta com o 666, fala desta como de vários personagens ou de alguém que perseguia os crist?os dessa época. <br>  <br>  Mais detalhes na pagina <a href="http://www.cancaonova.com/portal/canais/formacao/internas.php?id=&e=4016" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancaonova.com/portal/canais/...</a>

V d.C, como uma correspondência do milagre da Encarna??o. Centro de calorosos debates, ao longo do tempo, o milagre da Encarna??o de Deus em Maria passou a ser entendido como o dogma da virgindade da m?e de Cristo: nessa opera??o teológica, o unicórnio tornou-se um dos atributos recorrentes da Virgem."<br>  <br>  Os fanáticos no dia 25 de dezembro comemoram o nascimento do deus sol dos egípcios, ou o deus mitra dos persas e ainda diversos outros deuses inseridos na mitologia do mundo inteiro, menos o nascimento do Autor da Bíblia. <br>  <br>  Por que?<br>  <br>   Porque Ele criou todas as coisas que existem, inclusive o homem e a mulher. Ambos s?o criaturas criadas por ele. N?o compreender a Visita que ele fez àos habitantes da terra, em especial o povo que ele declarou como sendo seu povo (Jo?o 1,1s) n?o dá sustenta??o a teoria ridícula dos sábios do mundo todo: "desenvolver uma festa pag? que comemore o nascimento e morte do Senhor D-us que existe eternamente!"<br>  <br>  Ele é um D-us Imortal e n?o mortal. Essa característica do Senhor D-us que habita no céu, joga por terra a tradi??o pag? que é comemorada no mundo todo. Provando que o mundo inteiro abandonou o Culto do D-us Verdadeiro pelo culto de um deus mortal exibido crucificado, morto e ensaguentado numa grande cruz diante de um altar funébre há quase dois mil anos. Cumprindo o que predissera Paulo aos judeus a respeito deles mesmos.  Está Escrito: "Trocaram a Verdade de D-us pela mentira e adoraram e serviram a criatura em vez do Criador que é Bendito pelos séculos. Amém. (Rom 1,25)"<br>  <br>  <br>  A igreja católica de roma que você conhece hoje foi idealizada por romanos e judeus. A disputa pelo poder e fama, levou a igreja ortodoxa romper sua alian?a de morte eterna com a católica no evento conhecido por CISMA. <br>  <br>  O ORTODOXISMO E O CATOLICISMO s?o a origem de todo protestantismo que existe sobre o planeta terra, quer as facetas protestantes aceitem ou n?o. Todas est?o ligadas pelo pensamento satanico de constantino, fundador do cristianismo: "quem controla a religi?o, controla o povo e quem controla o povo controla o império."<br>  <br>  O império de constantino é representado pelo poderio da igreja católica e seu protestantismo mundial ligados pela mesma lei constantiniana: está escrito: "ACIMA DE TUDO <acima da Palavra do Altíssimo ensinada por Paulo em I Cor 3.21-23> recomendo que se fa?am preces, ora??es, súplicas, al?oes de gra?as por todos os homens, PELOS REIS DOS PAG?OS e por todos que est?o constituídos de autoridade por eles para que possamos viver uma vida calma e feliz com toda piedade e honestidade." (I Timóteo 2,1s)<br>  <br>  Esta carta apócrifa atribuída a Paulo para dar sustenta??o ao império de satanás por intermédio de constantino em todo planeta n?o encontra sustenta??o na Verdadeira Doutrina de Paulo, está escrito: Que ninguém ponha sua confian?a nos homens. Paulo, Apolo, Kepha <Pedro>, o mundo, a vida, o presente, o futuro. Tudo é vosso! Mas vós sóis do Cordeiro e o Cordeiro é de D-us. (I Cor 3,21-23)<br>  <br>  Reflita estas duas cartas e você entenderá que a 2a n?o apoia a 1a. O Governo Divino do Cordeiro de D-us no planeta terra inteiro n?o apoia o governo dos homens de carne e osso, mostrando que o mundo recebeu a doutrina do anti-messias de israel, doutrina esta que inclui-se a comemora??o de 25 de dezembro, páscoa romana do coelho de chocolate e outras inúmeras imposturas!|`|a7QjL56qaa	por  favor  quando  descobri, passe  para  mim  esta  importante  resposta   obrigado|`|dQfQ02HJaa	Pergunta postada apenas pela 15637490674 vez nos ultimos 2 dias.|`|jbqWytViaa	Isso nao importa, o que importa e que ele morreu na cruz pra te lavar dos seus pecados, aceite ele como senhor da sua vida, e seja salva|`|03e7fca9897118016e6d6a4fc21c5dabaa	Pq isso n?o tem importancia para o propósito da obra q jesus veio fazer.|`|6VhBvANyaa	O Natal n?o é biblico assim como também n?o representa a data de nascimento de Jesus.<br>  <br>  O Natal para come?o de conversa é o resultado do sincretismo de cren?as pag?s ao cristianismo.<br>  <br>  Durante os dois primeiros séculos da era crist?, a igreja n?o fazia ideia de qualquer festejo comemorando o nascimento de Jesus, pois registros históricos se sua passagem só surgiram por Flavius Josefus, que nada citou sobre nascimento do mesmo. Sabe-se que as narrativas de Flavius Josefus sobre Jesus ainda assim foram encomendadas o que torna mais complicada esta história toda.<br>  <br>  Shamash, o deus-sol dos caldeus tinha um templo em Babilónia que se chamava Etemenanki, que quer dizer a "casa das sete direc??es do céu e da terra." Todas as manh?s, ao nascer do sol, recitavam o hino solar em dire??o ao levante, do alto da torre mais alta.<br>  <br>  Os persas também tinham os seus deuses inspirados no sol. Entre eles destaca-se o deus Agni. <br>  No dia que corresponde ao nosso 24 de Dezembro queimavam o seu deus manufaturado de um tronco de árvore; isto depois de já terem feito outro que reponham no lugar do anterior. <br>  <br>  Ent?o com o novo deus em vigor, os dias come?avam a aumentar porque segundo supunham, o seu deus jovem estava cheio de vigor para produzir dias maiores. Adoravam-no ent?o com diversas solenidades aparatosas e sacrifícios humanos. <br>  <br>  No dia que corresponde ao 25 de Dezembro celebravam um estranho ritual que consistia no seguinte: No templo, onde guardavam o deus Agni de trás de uma cortina, havia uma fresta do lado oriental, por onde penetrava o sol ao nascer. <br>  Esses raios iam incidir na parte posterior da cabe?a do sacerdote que era dotado de uma calva espelhada. Ao refletirem-se nela iriam projetar-se num espelho em forma de sol, do qual derivou a custódia usada nos templos católicos romanos; e daí iria incidir no deus feito de madeira, que se encontrava no seu nicho com a cortina aberta. <br>  <br>  Tudo isto era feito entre a noite do dia equivalente ao 24 de Dezembro e o nascer do sol do dia 25. Um sacerdote voltado de costas para o povo. Quando os raios solares penetravam através da fresta do templo, e após todos estes ricochetes, o sacerdote voltava-se ent?o para o povo e ministrava as ben??os. <br>  <br>  Ra, o deus-sol egípcio foi quem primeiro reinou no país, segundo se crê. Era por esse motivo que o descendente direto do deus, o faraó, recebia culto tal como o seu antepassado. <br>  Os seus templos eram orientados de modo a que o nascer do sol ocorresse entre os dois pilares da entrada que eram encimados pelo sinal "neter", uma forma simbólica de falc?o real, representante do deus-sol. <br>  <br>  Nos hieroglifos, a cabe?a da vaca sagrada, vestal de Ra, tem entre os chifres o dístico solar. Os grandes mágicos da corte dos faraós auto-denominavam- se os "donos dos raios". <br>  <br>  Entre as tribos maias, da América do Sul, esses mesmos raios solares eram representados pela flecha, vetor ou mensageiro das aspira??es humanas. <br>  <br>  O Egito primitivo empregava menires indicadores e depois utilizou o obelisco para consagrar os seus cultos ao sol.<br>  (Menir é um monumento de pedra, cravado verticalmente no solo, às vezes de tamanho bem elevado)<br>  O mesmo acontece com menires bret?es cujo estudo da sua orienta??o tem demostrado o seu significado cronográfico. <br>  As unidades de Stonehenge, na Inglaterra e a de Kergonan na Bretanha, constituem verdadeiros templos solares.<br>  <br>  As civiliza??es gregas e romanas introduziram nos seus costumes as celebra??es saturnais, que consistiam em festejos dedicados ao deus-sol, denominados NATAALIS SOLIS INVICTI, ou seja: "o nascimento do sol invencível". <br>  <br>  Celebrado de forma semelhante à dos persas, no solestício do inverno, este ritual tinha a ver com o fato de o período do dia diminuir em rela??o ao da noite até 24 de Dezembro (do calendário atual) e daí em diante come?a a aumentar até ao mês de Julho.<br>  <br>  O Natal na verdade n?o tem nada a ver nem com Jesus nem com a Bíblia e nada absolutamente nada com o D′us Judaico.<br>  <br>  Abra?os

(obs: sou batizada). na biblia n?o tem nenhuma passagem escrita que fala que crian?as n?o podem tomar a santa ceia. Isso depende de cada pessoa, Vc tem que sew avaliar e ver se tem seguido o caminho de Deus. Se vc se sente pronto para ceiar, n?o precisa ter batismo para fazer isso. Isaso tambem precisa ser dito aos pais, pois como voce está sob  autoridade de seus pais e ainda n?o é batizado, se eles te autorizarem e vc se sentir pronto, n?o tem nenhum impedimento.<br>  <br>  Por exemplo: meu irm?o de 8 anos n?o é batizado,mas ele ceia,pq meu pai deixa e ele diz que se sente pronto para isso. Mas tem uma outra menina na minha igreja q tem 9 anos,e quer ceiar, diz que se sente preparada, mas a m?e dela n?o deixa,porque a filha ainda n?o é batizada.<br>  <br>  Isso depende de voce e da autoridade de seus pais. E o mesmo seria comigo se eu n?o fosse batizada. é claro que isso n?o depende do batismo, pq tem gente que é batizada e n?o ceia pq sente que n?o tem feito tudo conforme a vontade de Deus.<br>  <br>  Entendeu??? <br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado!|`|VJJhFOLeaa	Vamos ao Batismo: O modelo de batismo no Novo Testamento mostra que somente os que fazem uma profissao de fe digna de credito devem ser batizadas.<br>  Essa posi?ao e muitas vezes chamada  " batismo dos convertidos", ja que defende que somente os que creram em Jesus Cristo, ou especificamente , os que deram provas razoaveis de terem crido em Jesus, devem ser batizados.<br>  A razao disso e que o batismo, que e um simbolo do inicio da vida crista, deve ser ministrado apenas aos que de fato iniciaram a vida crista.<br>  Quando o canditado ao batismo desce as aguas vemos uma figura do descer a sepultura a do sepultamento .<br>  Quando o candidato sai das aguas vemos uma figura da ressurrei?ao de Jesus para que se ande em novidade de vida. Assim o batismo representa muito claramente a morte do velho modo de vida e o ressiscitar para um novo tipo de vida em Jesus.<br>  Vamos a Santa Ceia:  O significado da Seia do Senhor e complexo, rico e pleno. Ha varios aspectos simbolizando e afirmados na ceia do Senhor.<br>  A morte de Jesus, Nossa participa?ao nos beneficios da morte de Jesus, alimento espiritual, a unidade dos cristaos e a nossa fe em Jesus.<br>  Apesar das diferen?as sobre alguns aspectos da ceia do Senhor, a maioria dos protetantes iram concordar, em primeiro jugar, que somente os que ceem em Jesus devem participar da ceia, porque trata-se de um sinal de conversao e de permanencia da fe crista.<br>  Paulo adverte que os que comem e bebem indignamente enfrentarao serias consequencias : Pois quem come e bebe sem discernir o corpo, come e bebe juizo para si.<br>  Eis a razao por que ha entre vos meuitos fracos e doentes e nao poucos que dormem ( 1 Co 11.29-30 ).<br>  Em segundo lugar, muitos protestantes argumentariam com base no significado do batismo e da ceia do Senhorque, normalmente , somente os que ja foram batizados devem participar da ceia do Senhor. Razao disso e que o batismo e nitidamente um simbolo do inicio da vida crista, enquanto a ceia do Senhor e claramente um simbolo da permanencia na vida crista.<br>  Portanto , se alguem toma ceia do Senhor e da publico testemunho de que esta permanecendo na vida crista, tal pessoa deve ser inquirida.<br>  Por isso aquele que comer o pao e beber o calice do Senhor, indignamente, sera reu do corpo e sangue de Senhor.<br>  Examine-se o homem a si mesmo, e assimcoma e beba do calice; pois quem come e bebe aem discernir o corpo, come e bebe  para juizo para si ( 1 Co 11.27-29 )<br>  No seu caso, a sua idade nao o impede  voce se batizar e nem participar da ceia do Senhor.<br>  Visto que o batismo e o arrependimento dos seus pecados e voce ja esta crescido o suficiente para tomar posse das suas responsabilidas espirituais.<br>  Em caso de disciplina eclesiastica ou quando a conduta de um irmao da sinais evidentes que ele esta desviando de Cristo, os lideres da igreja podem decedir adverti-lo de modo claro e firme para que nao participe da ceia, de forma que o irmao ou irma em pecado nao coma nem beba juizo sobre si mesmo.<br>  Mas tais casos sao raros, e devemos tambem evitar o erro de muitas igrejs, que tao rigorosas na ministra?ao da ceiado Senhor e deixam de fora da ceia muitos cristao verdadeiros, e assim a unidade do verdadeiro corpo de Cristo nao e representada, nem os crentes tem acesso as ben?oes espirituais que por direito lhes pertencem em Cristo na participa?ao dessa ordenan?a.<br>  Se voce congrega em alguma igreja procure o seu pastor, pois nao fique na rebeldia, ele e o seu pastor, e vai le orientar, pois cada igreja tem a sua visao doutrinaria a respeito do batismo e caeia de Senhor.<br>  Paz do Senhor.|`|6u7DD9Fhaa	A melhor coisa a fazer é perguntar ao seu pastor (a), se pode ou n?o...se vc tem caminhado no evangelho deve saber que deve-se batizar.<br>  Vc já aceito a Jesus como Senhor e Salvador de sua vida?<br>  Se a resposta for sim...vc deve procurar  o batismo e em seguida participar da santa-ceia.<br>  N?o que isto seja uma regra mais o fato de vc ter aceitado Jesus o capacita a participar da santa-ceia, mas só quem pode te autorizar ou n?o é o seu pastor, se ele te pedir para que vc se batize nas águas o que te impedes?<br>  Andar com Cristo exige compromisso e fidelidade Ele nos deixou exemplos que devemos segui-los.<br>  Só para lembrar um dos presos que estava ao lado de Jesus na crucifica??o n?o foi batizado, mas entrou no céu.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lucas 23:39-43<br>  39 Ent?o um dos malfeitores que estavam pendurados, blasfemava dele, dizendo: N?o és tu o Cristo? salva-te a ti mesmo e a nós.<br>  40 Respondendo, porém, o outro, repreendia-o, dizendo: Nem ao menos temes a Deus, estando na mesma condena??o?<br>  41 E nós, na verdade, com justi?a; porque recebemos o que os nossos feitos merecem; mas este nenhum mal fez.<br>  42 Ent?o disse: Jesus, lembra-te de mim, quando entrares no teu reino.<br>  43 Respondeu-lhe Jesus: Em verdade te digo que hoje estarás comigo no paraíso.|`|Dpj185cgaa	Olha tomar Santa Ceia vc n?o pode antes do batismo, o batismo significa morrer para o mundo, n?o praticar as coisas que o mundo pratica(pecado), e a Santa Ceia só se pode tomar aquele que está em comunh?o com a igreja e com os irm?os.<br>  <br>  "porque todas as vezes que comerdes desse p?o, e beberdes desse cálice, anunciais a morte do Senhor, até que venha.<br>  prtanto, qualquer que comer este p?o ou beber o cálice do Senhor, indignamente, será culpado do corpo e do sangue do Semhor" 1 Corintios 11:26-27<br>  <br>  amigo te aconselho a n?o tomar por que vc ainda n?o é batizado e n?o está preparado...<br>  Muitas pessoas tem participado da Ceia do Senhor indignamente e tem sofrido por causa disso olhe o versiculo abaixo.<br>  <br>  "por causa disso, há entre vós muitos fracos e doentes e muitos que dormem" 1 Corintios 11: 30.<br>  <br>  te aconselho a batizar primeiro..<br>  fik na paz do Senhor Jesus<br>  <br>  e que o Espirito Santo fale mais ao seu cora??o..|`|J8XT3IsFaa	Amado a ceia é somente para os membros em comunh?o com cristo.. você só pode tomar ceia após batizar.... se vc quizer  batizar vc já pode... eu me batizei com 13 anos de idade!! !!bjs!!!|`|M5oEqTPBaa	Se você é evangélico, pergunte ao seu pastor, ou àquele que te ensina ou discipula.<br>  <br>  A Bíblia n?o coloca restri??es quanto a tomar a ceia do Senhor antes de se batizar, ou por ter 12 anos.

A morte primeiramente n?o foi criada por Deus, e sim foi a consequência da desobediência de Ad?o.  Pois se comesse ou melhor desobedecesse a Deus o pecado estaria gerando a morte.<br>  Uma vez que isso acaba com toda a humanidade que é a aparência e semelhan?a de Deus, o diabo astutamente preparou essa armadilha ao homem, e Deus trouxe Jesus para alterar isso, morrendo Ele a nossa morte, portando n?o precisamos mais morrer, e sim crer nesse sacrifício único, pleno e prefeito.<br>  E veja qual é na realidade o mandamento de Deus -   <br>  "(Jo?o 12:50) - E sei que o seu mandamento é a Vida Eterna.

hEeSG0TEaa	Caro Jo?o para tudo existe uma explica??o lógica, o fato de algumas n?o serem de conhecimento humano n?o significa que elas n?o existem.<br>  <br>  Primeiro quero que vc esque?a a mensagem crist? e se atente a mensagem judaica revelada nas Escrituras dos judeus ! o Texto afirma; No principio (de tudo) criou ELOHIM (as For?as) os ceus e a terra...<br>  <br>  Por mais que a teologia crist? traduza a palavra hebraica Elohim para Deus, ela n?o reflete em nada a ideia judaica, pois Elohim significa literalmente For?as/Poderes, manifesta??es ocorridas dentro da ordem estabelecida no Universo. Outro detalhe a palavra deus é apenas uma corruptela da palavra Zeus....isso é t?o verdade, que no imaginario das pessoas Deus é lembrado como um pai, que fica sentado num trono, num lugar celeste, um homem de branco com barba...indicando uma possivel idade avan?ada e uma possivel sabedoria !! Essa imagem é grega....o judaismo jamais ousou dar uma imagem a For?a (EL), pois todo jude entendeu a revela??o. Veja outro exemplo....os crist?os dizem que a palavra Elohim significa Deus....pois Elohim é plural, e a palavra latina também é plural !!! Mas o singular de Elohim é EL ! e o singular da palagra Deus...como fica ?!<br>  Ent?o vamos lá Elohim em hebraico significa For?as/Poderes....El que é o singular singinifica For?a/Poder....como ent?o se explica a palavra latinizada Deus ???<br>  <br>  Se vc compreender tudo isso, fica claro que a mensagem da Biblia crist? está errada, que ela n?o reflete o pensamento judaico. E ai fica mais facil ainda vc entender as manifesta??es provocadas por Ele (Poder) na natureza...fica facil vc entender porque os textos hebraicos batem na mesma tecla " n?o criar nenhum tipo de imagem de Elohim" pois como vc vai criar uma imagem ou dar um nome a algo que vc n?o tem uma aparencia fisica !! Por isso nós judeus damos varios apelidos a Elohim....exemplos: Adonai (Senhor)....Adonai Tsevaot (Senhor dos exercitos)...Ribono Olam (Dono do mundo)...Melech Melachim (Rei dos Reis)....e mais um monte de apelidos....inclussive o Tetagrama que é nada mais nada menos do que uma frase que indica bem a idéia judaica. O Tetagrama é um acrsotico da frase...Eu fui, Eu sou e Eu serei....como vc pode perceber esssa frase remete a uma idéia atemporal....passado, presente e futuro ! a melhor palavra da lingua portuguesa que se aproxima dessa idéia é a palavra Eterno ! <br>  <br>  Com isso vc percebe o quanto existe de erro no mundo, onde pessoas querem dar nomes a Elohim...nomes que fogem a todo o pensamento das escrituras hebraicas.<br>  <br>  Caso seja do seu interesse em aprender mais, pe?o que entre no site www.bneinoahdobrasil.com.br   o site é judaico voltado para n?o judeus que tem interesse de aprender as escrituras hebraicas de fonte correta e honesta de um livro judaico que sofreu modifica??es e deturpa??es por cren?as sem compromiso com a verdade dos fatos.<br>  <br>  Cordialmente|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	Ele é o Alfa eo ?mega, Ele é DEUS, n?o tem princípio nem fim .<br>  Quem disse que Deus foi criado?

O que se tornaria uma bola de neves, que rolaria sem fim, n?o nos levando a lugar algum, e deixando-nos mais ainda na ignorancia (ignorancia aqui n?o é burrice, por favor n?o entenda assim, mas falta de conhecimento adequado) Deus n?o pode ser entendido, compreendido simplesmente com a nossa mente humana, pois esta é muito limitada. é por isso que existem tantos ateus no mundo, porque eles tentam entender Deus com a mente humana limitada, coisa impossível, porque a mente é muito lógica, e partindo da seguinte premissa de que Deus é ilógico, ou seja, n?o pode ser compreendido a partir da lógica e raciocínios humanos, ent?o, n?o posso crer, porque só creio naquilo que vejo e posso tocar, como Deus n?o pode ser visto nem tocado fisicamente, existem ateus. A única maneira de entendermos Deus é por meio da fé, sem ela n?o há a menor possibilidade. Entende o porque desta pergunta n?o ter lógica? Deus é incriado, n?o tem inicio de dias nem fim de dias ou de tempos. Aliás, diga-se de passagem, o tempo foi criado por Deus para que dentro dele, Ele pudesse concretizar a Sua obra. Deus é eterno. N?o existe algo como: "Quem criou Deus".

qvycijbOaa	Remain calm, talk slow, the calmer you seem the more in control you are. If the other persons reaction is hostile it means that they are struggling to get their point across. Also, when you talk slower and just generally slow down more points on the topic of the debate will come into your mind. =)|`|NsFaPI9waa	Reference Facts Accurately During the Debate    Facts support your points. They should be well-researched and correctly stated and they should come from irrefutable sources.     Make Your Points in the Debate Clearly    Dont use terms that are ambiguous, open to interpretation or that require specialized knowledge to understand. When speaking to like-minded people you can assume with relative comfort that they will understand your meaning. In an open forum, however, this is not always the case.    Do Your Homework Before the Debate    Before entering into any debate there are two things you should understand: your position and that of your opponent. If you dont have a thorough understanding of your position youll never be able to explain it to anyone else. The same goes with the holes you are attempting to poke in your opponents logic. If you dont thoroughly understand all aspects (and subtle nuances) of his argument, you stand a good chance of proving his point instead of your own.    In addition avoid these common traps:       1. Attacking the arguer, not the argument.     2. Assuming an answer with the phraseology of the question.     3. Misunderstanding and/or misrepresenting statistics.     4. Confusing cause and effect.     5. Creating a caricature rather than presenting reality.    Following these simple, logical guidelines may not make for tantalizing discourse but it will empower you to hold your own in an intellectual debate with just about anyone.|`|PvPPivLJaa	1. Don't resort to insults. It immediately defeats any argument you were trying to make.    2. Don't appeal to emotion. Stick to the facts and logic    3. Listen thoroughly and politely and wait your turn, then figure out where their logic is flawed and point it out to them    4. Accept their view of reality as their own and don't take it personally.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Know your subject extremely well, inside and out. If someone is making more point than you, you listen and then come back with your  own debate to make your own point.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Don't get angry, keep smiling. Easy debates, you always want to go for truthful substantial attacks.  Don't make up things that aren't relevant to the person you are debating with.  You must always have knowledge on the subject, when that person starts to stray away from the topic, you kick them where it hurts on their lack of intelligences on a topic you brought up, better yet, they brought up.  The person loses when they can't think of anything substantial to say, they always use irrelevant insults.  I'm a great debater.|`|wTqid2ONaa	How about just admitting that the other person has a good point ?    If all else fails you can just throw a tantrum i guess.|`|NgnbtaORaa	Research both sides of the argument including criticisms so you already know the underpinning flaws in your opponents argument as well as your own.

Hitler conveyed anger is much of his speeches and political debates and the masses followed him like sheep: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KgJQUXr2...    If anything, including anger (and when I refer to "anger", I'm not talking about mere ranting) illustrates that you are more passionate about the subject, and in turn makes the listeners more passionate about it too.      Although I could write a long list of tips, I'd say the two rudimentary tips are orientated in the individual's lexicon:   1) "Power words"  2) Using words that are understood both by you and the person spoken to, as well as the audience watching you.    When I say "Power words", it is a tactic used by politicians to get the audience on their side. For example, "Freedom", "Equality", "Human Rights", among a long list of others that is fundamentally flawed to argue against. Hitler used it; Stalin used; Obama has used it. The large majority of people on this planet, whether we want to accept this or not, are simply lost leaves in the wind who only react to words that have been decided by society as ethically, morally, and fundamentally correct. Does that mean your argument is the right one? Not at all - it simply helps an individual win a debate.     The other tip I would say, of which is heavily related to the above paragraph, is to use terminology and words that people understand. "You're only as smart as the person you're talking to" - speaking of quantum mechanics to your average plumber isn't going to do you any good. If anything, it can critically injure your point as it depicts that you're trying to "sound smart" and subjugate the plumber as intellectually inferior. Using language that is understood easily by that of the consensus also evokes a subconcious message that "you are a part of them" and also evokes that you are understanding of their point, but realize that it is logically flawed.

E questo poiché per secoli l'idea iniziatica e neo-pagana dell'ordinamento sacerdotale ha portato la massa omune ha ritenere che taluni potessero essere immortali scrigni di santità e beatitdine, quando invece erano i primi e principali nemici della moralità che professavano. L'uomo deve continuare l'eroica riscoperta di una morale semplice e alla portata di tutti, continuando l'eroico processo di evangelizzazione moderna iniziata da Lutero. Solo così la morale sarà universalmente rispettata.|`|jKbPyeTXaa	Scusami Ma ORGOGLIO pedofilo??|`|rUINby6taa	LA TUA PREFAZIONE E’ INTERESSANTE MA HAI <br>  <br>  DIMENTICATO DI SCRIVERE LA FONTE DALLA QUALE <br>  <br>  L’HAI PRESA PER NON CORRERE IL RISCHIO CHE <br>  <br>  QUALCUNO PENSI CHE L’ABBIA SCRITTA TU.<br>  <br>  <br>  O NON SEI IN GRADO DI SCRIVERE QUALCOSA DI <br>  <br>  SENSATO CHE SIA TUO?|`|rfQFBxjoaa	Chi l'ha organizzata,la chiesa cattolica?<br>  <br>  ?L’esperienza degli ultimi 24 anni mostra chiaramente che questo non è un problema marginale che coinvolge un piccolo gruppo di chierici che hanno abusato di un piccolo numero di bambini. Il problema è complesso, diffuso e terribile. Le vittime includono bambini di entrambi i sessi, così come adulti, che sono stati violentati ed abusati. Gli abusatori non sono un piccolo numero di preti disagiati, ma un discreto numero di preti, religiosi e vescovi. Ci sono anche religiose che hanno abusato di bambini affidati alle loro cure o che hanno compiuto abusi su giovani membri delle proprie comunità… [cut]… I vescovi cattolici raramente hanno affrontato questo scandalo con “dignità e coraggio”, come lei ha dichiarato in un’intervista. I vescovi sono stati incalzati dai media, dai tribunali o dall’opinione pubblica ad affrontare ciò che hanno coperto per decenni. I vescovi e i loro rappresentanti hanno ripetutamente mentito e distorto il proprio ruolo cercando di far ricadere la colpa sulla stampa secolare, sugli psichiatri o psicologi, o su invisibile “forze anti-cattoliche” liberali post Vaticano II o sulla cosiddetta “rivoluzione sessuale”. Sarebbe stato meglio se avessero apertamente e onestamente ammesso il proprio diretto coinvolgimento e i propri sforzi volti a continuare a distorcere e coprire il fenomeno. Perfino oggi, sebbene una minoranza di vescovi cerchino onestamente di comprendere la profondità del problema, la maggior parte della stessa Conferenza Episcopale continua a promuovere la falsa tesi di aver agito prontamente e pienamente e che il problema sia esaurito. Questo è un nonsenso di fronte alla dura evidenza che le vittime di abusi sessuali del clero continuano a venire alla luce regolarmente. E’ al corrente del fatto che molti vescovi, incluso il Cardinale Mahony, hanno mentito sotto giuramento, mentre testimoniavano al processo??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&rlz=1B3GGGL_itIT244IT244&q=Report+on+the+Crisis+in+the+Catholic+Church+in+the+United+States%2C+National+Review+Board+for+the+Protection+of+Children+and+Young+People&btnG=Cerca&meta=lr%3Dlang_it" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&rlz=1B...</a><br>  <br>  Qualche giorno fa ,la chiesa ha indetto una giornata di preghiera per i sacerdoti,che si sono macchiati di un crimine cosi' orrendo,vale a dire recitare una preghiera ,saltare una cena,e poi tutto ritorna a posto,questo è il messaggio.Ora spiegatemi perche' a un prete pedofilo basta una preghiera e tutto torna a posto,mentre a un pedofilo che non è prete dovrebbe farsi anni di galera.Non è tutto troppo sconvolgente?Che messaggio si da al mondo intero?Che basta recitare una preghiera e tutto ritorno nella grazia di Dio,...non parliamo poi della giustizia che in questi casi non viene neanche menzionata.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cantalamessa aveva osservato che la Chiesa ha "pianto e sospirato" recentemente "per gli abomini commessi nel suo seno da alcuni dei suoi stessi ministri e pastori".

Castigo a culpa dos pais nos filhos até a terceira e quarta gera??o dos que me odeiam, mas uso de misericórdia por mil gera??es para com os que me amam e guardam meus mandamentos. (Texto usado da Bíblia Católica - editora vozes e editora Santuário - 41° edi??o).<br>  <br>  Veja, o texto usado é o da bíblia "Católica" o qual vamos analisar com Sabedoria e entendimento:<br>  <br>  - N?o terás outros deuses além de mim.<br>  <br>  - N?o farás para ti ídolos, nem figura alguma!<br>  <br>  - N?o te prostrarás diante deles, nem lhe prestaras culto!<br>  <br>  Agora pense, quando alguém está diante de uma imagem:<br>  <br>  - Ela n?o adora?<br>  <br>  - Ela n?o se encurva diante do ídolo?<br>  <br>  - Ela n?o presta culto para os ídolos?<br>  <br>  <br>  O que significa a palavra ídolo?<br>  <br>  Vamos junto ao Aurélio, veja o que significa ídolo:<br>  <br>  - Estátua ou simples objeto cultuado como "deus ou deusa".<br>  <br>  - Objeto em que se julga "habitar um espírito, e por isso venerado".<br>  <br>  - Pessoa a quem se tributa respeito ou afeto excessivo.<br>  <br>  Quem pratica adora??o a ídolos, pratica a idolatria, que é um culto prestado a ídolos, os devotos das imagens possuem um amor ou uma paix?o exagerada, e isso o nosso Deus n?o admite no próprio capitulo em que lemos. "Deus é um Deus zeloso).<br>  <br>  A palavra idolatria vem do grego "EIDILON, íDOLO E LATREUNIEM, ADORAR, este termo é usado á adora??o ou venera??o a ídolos ou imagens, quando usada em seu sentido primário". No seu sentido mais amplo, este vai para adora??o de qualquer objeto, pessoa, institui??o, ambi??o que tome o lugar de Deus, ou que lhe diminua a honra que lhe devamos.<br>  <br>  Assim vem a Adora??o dos falsos deuses, levar ao conhecimento do homem algum objeto, imagem ou qualquer objeto que venha tirar a honra e glória de Deus.<br>  <br>  DEUS PROIBE FAZER DEUSES FALSOS E N?O IMAGENS - ALEGA??O CATóLICA<br>  <br>  Esta é uma alega??o do livro Resposta aos crentes :<br>  <br>  Pe. Vicente Sverdi, diz que Deus n?o proibiu fazer imagens, mas o que Deus proibiu é fazer deuses falsos e adora-los.<br>  <br>  Vamos analisar: A ordem de n?o fazer imagens é justamente para n?o virar o que virou!<br>  <br>  Existe mais adora??o a ídolos do que para Deus, existe mais devo??o ou venera??o aos santos do que para Deus, você n?o acha?<br>  <br>  - Se você é católico e passa uma dificuldade para quem você recorre primeiro?<br>  <br>  - Para Deus ou para o seu santo?<br>  <br>  Se faz promessa para quem?<br>  <br>  Se paga promessa para quem?<br>  <br>  Em dias comemorativos dos santos vemos pessoas que "oram, pedindo para os santos", muitos já nem usam o crucifixo e sim a Santinha (o) pendurado no pesco?o.<br>  <br>  Ent?o o que virou as imagens?<br>  <br>  N?o virou um deus ou deusa para muitos?<br>  <br>  Sim, viraram deuses, e s?o mais lembrados pelos seus devotos do que Deus, a igreja católica já possui mais santos do que os dias do ano, por isso que existe o dia de todos os santos, para que pelo menos se esqueceram de algum santo durante o ano, ele será lembrado neste dia.<br>  <br>  PARE E PENSE - é JUSTO LEMBRAR MAIS DA CRIATURA DO QUE DO CRIADOR?<br>  <br>  Devemos dividir a glória do Criador, Senhor dos senhores, com alguma imagem, mesmo que ela foi uma pessoa importante para o evangelho ou para o mundo?<br>  <br>  Veja o que Deus diz sobre repartir a glória:<br>  <br>  - Isaias cap.42v. 8<br>  <br>  "Eu sou o Senhor, este é o meu nome"; A MINHA GLóRIA POIS, A OUTREM N?O DAREI, NEM O MEU LOUVOR, àS IMAGENS DE ESCULTURA ".<br>  -Isaias 48 v. 11<br>  <br>  "Por amor de mim, por amor de mim, o farei porque como seria profanado o meu nome? E a minha glória" N?o darei a outrem".<br>  <br>  A ordem de n?o fazer ídolos está relacionado à adora??o, a contamina??o de idéias, de que a imagem pode fazer alguma coisa, ou seja; que o homem iria submeter-se a imagem como se ela fosse Deus. Dentro na nossa história temos várias imagens e estatuas, mas elas n?o s?o adoradas, como o busto de muitos, D.Pedro I, Tiradentes etc... Nem por isso veio a ser adorados, mas dentro da igreja católica os ídolos ou imagens vieram a ser igual ou porque n?o dizer que algumas est?o acima de Deus!<br>  <br>  O mandamento de Deus para com o povo de Israel era para n?o fazer as imagens porque pela sua Onisciência, um atributo que somente Deus pai, Filho e Espírito Santo possui e que já é dado pelos homens a muitas Imagens, Deus sabia que a contamina??o, a pervers?o vinha à tona, n?o foi assim com a saída deles do Egito, quando se viram sem Moises? o que fizeram?<br>  <br>  Um bezerro de Ouro e prestaram um culto a ele, n?o foi assim?<br>  <br>  Pense no que eu vou lhe dizer agora:<br>  <br>  - SE DEUS QUISESSE QUE NóS TIVESSEMOS UMA IMAGEM PARA SER ADORADA OU VENERADA QUE LEMBRASSE AO SENHOR, ELE TINHA TODO O PODER PARA APARECER DIANTE DO POVO QUE RETIROU DO EGITO EM FORMA ESCULTURAL , UMA FORMA DE ALGO QUE PUDESSE VIRAR UMA IMAGEM E SER ADORADA PELO SEU POV.<br>  <br>  MAS COMO ELE APARECEU PARA O SEU POVO?<br>  <br>  - QUAL FOI A FORMA ESCULTURAL QUE DEUS USOU PARA SE MOSTRAR AO SEU POVO?<br>  <br>  - UMA NUVEM E UMA COLUNA DE FOGO.<br>  <br>  SABE PORQUE DEUS SE MOSTROU DESTA FORMA? FOGO E NUVEM?<br>  <br>  PORQUE N?O EXISTE A POSSIBILIDADE DE FAZER UMA ESCULTURA DO FOGO E NUVEM COM AS SUAS CARACTERISTICAS SEMPRE IGUAIS, POIS A MUDAN?A VISUAL S?O CONSTANTES. E O PRóPRIO DEUS RESPONDE A ESTA PERGUNTA:<br>  <br>  Deuteron?mio 4v. 14 - 19<br>  <br>  "Também o Senhor me ordenou ao mesmo tempo, que vos ensinasse estatutos e juízos, para que os fizésseis na terra a qual passais a possuir. Guardai, pois com diligencia a vossa alma, POIS SEMELHAN?A NENHUMA VISTES NO DIA EM QUE O SENHOR VOSSO DEUS, EM HOREBE FALOU CONVOSCO, DO MEIO DO FOGO; PARA QUE N?O VOS CORROMPEIS E VOS FA?AIS ALGUMA ESCULTURA, SEMELHAN?A DE IMAGEM, FIGURA DE MACHO OU DE FEMEA; FIGURA DE ALGUM ANIMAL QUE HAJA NA TERRA, FIGURA DE ALGUMA AVE ALíGERA QUE VOA PELOS CéUS; FIGURA DE ANIMAL QUE ANDA DE RASTRO SOBRE A TERRA, FIGURA ALGUMA PEIXE QUE ESTEJA NAS áGUAS DEBAIXO DA TERRA, E N?O LEVANTES OS TEUS OLHOS AOS CéUS E VEJAS O SOL, E A LUA, E AS ESTRELAS, TODO O EXERCITO DOS CéUS, E SEJAS IMPELIDO A QUE TE INCLINES PERANTE ELES, E SIRVAS AQUELES QUE O SENHOR TEU DEUS, REPARTIU A TODOS OS POVOS DEBAIXO DE TODO OS CéUS".<br>  <br>  A resposta contra as imagens é esta, esta na Bíblia, Deus n?o se fez ver por uma imagem que se dá para esculpir, o fogo n?o fica parado e nem tem fisionomia se podemos falar assim, uma fisionomia igual a todos, todo o fogo é diferente, da mesma forma a nuvem, por isso Deus é um Deus zeloso que n?o divide a sua glória com ninguém, nem com qualquer imagem de Escultura.<br>  <br>  Deus condenou os ídolos:<br>  <br>  - Salmos 115 v. 4-8<br>  <br>  "Os ídolos deles s?o de pratas e ouro, obras das m?os dos homens. Tem boca mais n?o falam, tem olhos mais n?o vêem, tem ouvidos mas n?o ouvem, nariz mais n?o cheiram. Tem m?os mas n?o apalpam, tem pés mas n?o andam; nem som algum sai da garganta".<br>  <br>  "Tornam-se semelhantes a eles os que os fazem e todos os que neles confiam.".<br>  <br>  Sabemos que várias imagens eram feitas naquele tempo como hoje, feitas de matérias caras ou os mais pobres, argila, madeira, mármore etc..e trouxeram o desvio da glória de Deus, por isso Deus trabalhou muito com o seu povo quando tirou-os do Egito para que n?o fizesse imagens para eles.<br>  <br>  - êxodo 34v. 17 "N?o farás para ti deuses de fundi??o".<br>  <br>  Com o passar dos tempos Deus n?o deixou esta quest?o de lado, os profetas vieram a falar contra as imagens de escultura:<br>  <br>  - Isaias 30 v. 22 - texto da bíblia Católica - editora vozes.<br>  <br>  "Considerai impuros os teus ídolos cobertos de prata e as tuas imagens revestidas de ouro. Como lixo os jogaras fora e lhes dirás:"Fora Daqui!".<br>  <br>  Gostaria de que você prestasse muita aten??o sobre este texto de Isaías cap.44 ver. 9- 19<br>  <br>  "Todos os artífices de imagem de escultura s?o vaidade, e as suas coisas mais desejáveis s?o de nenhum" préstimos"e suas mesmas testemunhas nada vêem, nem entendem, para que eles sejam confundidos".<br>  <br>  Quem forma um deus e funde uma imagem de escultura "que é de nenhum préstimo?".<br>  <br>  Eis que todos os seus"seguidores" ficar?o confundidos, pois os mesmos artífices s?o dentre os homens; ajuntem-se todos e levantem-se; assombrar-se-?o e ser?o juntamente confundidos.<br>  <br>  O ferreiro faz o machado, e trabalha nas brasas e o forma com martelos, e o lavra com a for?a do seu bra?o, ele tem fome, e a sua for?a falta, e n?o bebe água e desfalece. O carpinteiro estende a régua, emprega a almagra e aplaina com o cepilho, e marca como compasso, e faz o seu"deus a semelhan?a de um homem, segundo a forma de um homem para ficar em casa.<br>  <br>  Tomou para si cedros ou toma um cipreste, ou um carvalho e esfor?a-se contra as arvores do bosque; planta um olmeiro e a chuva o faz crescer.<br>  <br>  Ent?o, servir?o ao homem para queimar. Com isso, se esquenta e coze o p?o; também faz um deus e se prostra diante dele; fabrica uma imagem de escultura e ajoelha diante dela. Metade queima, com a outra metade, come carne; assa-a e farta-se também se auqenta e diz: Ora, já me aquentei, já vi o fogo.<br>  <br>  Ent?o, do resto faz um deus, uma imagem de escultura e ajoelha-se diante dela, e se"INCLINA, e lhe dirige a sua" ORA??O", e diz:" LIVRA-ME PORQUANTO OU éS O MEU DEUS"".<br>  <br>  Nada sabem, nem entendem, porque se lhe untaram os olhos, para que n?o vejam, e o cora??o, PARA QUE N?O ENTENDAM.<br>  <br>  E nenhum deles toma isso a peito, e já n?o tem conhecimento nem entendimento para dizer: Metade queimei, metade cozi p?o sobre as suas brasas e assei sobre elas a carne, e a comi, e faria eu do resto uma abomina??o?<br>  <br>  Ajoelhar-me-ia eu ao que saiu de uma árvore?<br>  <br>  Apascenta-se de cinza; O SEU CORA??O ENGANADO O DESVIOU DE MANEIRA QUE N?O PODE LIVRAR A SUA ALMA, NEM DIZER: N?O Há UMA MENTIRA NA MINHA M?O DIREITA?<br>  <br>  <br>  A SERPENTE DE METAL - Num. 21 4-9<br>  <br>  Em nenhum momento, vemos na Palavra de Deus que a serpente de metal deveria ser cultuada. Diante deste fato, a pessoa que fosse picada por uma serpente venenosa, deveria olhar para a serpente de metal para ser curada. Deus nunca pediu que aquela serpente virasse uma imagem na qual o seu povo ajoelha-se ou prestasse qualquer tipo de culto ou devo??o. No entanto, quando a serpente de metal veio a ser colocada como ídolo, ela come?ou a receber adora??o e ser venerada e o rei Ezequias fez a vontade do Senhor .<br>  <br>  II REIS 18V. 3- 5<br>  <br>  "E fez o que era reto aos olhos do Senhor, conforme tudo o que fizera Davi, seu Pai. Ele tirou os altos, quebrou as estátuas, deitou os bosques, e fez em peda?os a serpente de metal que Moisés fizera; porquanto até aquele dia os filhos de Israel lhe queimavam incenso, e lhe chamaram NEUST?. No Senhor Deus de Israel confiou, de maneira que depois dele n?o houve quem lhe fosse semelhante entre todos os reis de Judá, nem entre todos os que foram antes."<br>  <br>  Agora, existe a diferen?a de ídolos e imagens! A arte religiosa possui várias imagens, mas elas n?o s?o ídolos. Podemos dizer que na arca temos a imagem do querubim, mas a pergunta é :<br>  <br>  - Quando é que estas imagens se tornaram ídolos?<br>  <br>  - Aonde ela ficava no templo?<br>  <br>  - Se o sacerdote entrasse para fazer qualquer tipo de sacrifício e adorasse aqueles querubins da arca, o que aconteceria com ele? Morreria.<br>  <br>  Pois se os lideres Católicos est?o dispostos a mostrar que as imagens do Catolicismo n?o s?o ídolos e n?o s?o adoradas, deixo aqui um desafio :<br>  <br>  - Porque os padres n?o fazem uma análise Bíblica e olhem para os seus símbolos católicos, e vejam qual é que virou ídolo ou n?o, e tomem a seguinte posi??o:<br>  - Os que viraram ídolos, os sacerdotes Católicos poderiam fazer como o rei Ezequias: FA?A-AS EM PEDA?OS !<br>  <br>  Veja, se alguém acende um incenso para elas, velas, se fazem pedidos a elas, que tomem o exemplo do Rei Ezequias, porque até a Bíblia diz que ele fez o que era Reto Aos olhos de Deus, e a sua atitude demonstrou zelo pela adora??o no único Deus.<br>  <br>  Será que a Nata, Os arcebispos, bispos e o Papa está disposta a fazer o que o Rei Ezequias fez?<br>  <br>  O que virou adora??o - Vamos estar repudiando.<br>  <br>  O que virou um símbolo simplesmente - Vamos deixá-la.<br>  <br>  Pois a própria Igreja ensina que ela serve de ensino para os analfabetos!<br>  <br>  Serve mesmo ou seria uma desculpa pelos interesses financeiros ?<br>  <br>  Pois ídolos fazem pessoas e entidades religiosas enriquecerem !<br>  <br>  E aqui vai um conselho também para os evangélicos:<br>  <br>  Você que precisa de um Sal para se livrar do encosto, a rosa ungida, o len?o ungido, passar pelo corredor dos duzentos pastores ou qualquer tipo de atitude que possa materializar a sua fé, você também está praticando a idolatria.<br>  <br>  Isto n?o é nenhum desaforo para os Católicos, pois veja:<br>  <br>  A própria Igreja Católica defini que a idolatria é;<br>  <br>  "Prestar a alguma criatura, por exemplo, a uma estátua, a uma imagem, a um homem, o culto supremo de adora??o, devido só a Deus (Terceiro Catecismo de Doutrina Crist?, Editora Vera Cruz, LTDA, 1o Edi??o, agosto de 1976, resposta à pergunta 358)".<br>  <br>  N?o é uma incoerência? Se fosse desaforo, o Catecismo da Igreja Católica estaria sendo mais desaforado que eu ! Mas, infelizmente, existe sempre desculpas para tudo:<br>  <br>  A igreja Católica responde da seguinte forma:<br>  <br>  "Entre o culto que prestamos a Deus e o culto que prestamos aos santos, há uma diferen?a: que a Deus adoramo-lo pela sua infinita excelência, ao passo que aos santos n?o os adoramos, mas só os honramos e veneramos como amigos de Deus e nossos intercessores junto a dEle. O culto que prestamos a Deus chama-se LATRIA, isto é, de Adora??o, e o culto que prestamos aos santos chama-se Fulia, isto é, de Venera??o aos servos de Deus, enfim o culto especial que prestamos a Maria Santíssima chama-se HIPERDULIA, isto é, especialíssima venera??o, como M?e de Deus (Terceiro Catecismo de Doutrina Crist?, Editora Vera Cruz Ltda, 1o edi??o, agosto de 1976, resposta à pergunta 371, p.76 )."<br>  <br>  Ent?o a Adora??o que se presta aos santos, Maria e a Deus pode-se chamar de ADORA??O PIRAMIDAL.<br>  <br>  LATRIA - ADORA??O A DEUS<br>  <br>  HIPERDULIA - DEVO??O A MARIA<br>  <br>  DULIA- DEVO??O AOS SANTOS E AOS ANJOS.<br>  <br>  Será que existe diferen?a?<br>  <br>  Será que alguém sabe ponderar a sua adora??o aos santos para n?o ultrapassar para adora??o que deveria ser de Deus?<br>  <br>  Ent?o qual é a diferen?a? Será que todos católicos conhecem o que é esta Estrutura Piramidal de Adora??o?|`|916cb9c45ac7cf4cd8da13e8a474728aaa	Fotografia, pintura, bordados, silk, tudo é imagem.<br>  <br>  Cara, estou doando todas as minhas imagens de escultura porque é "pecado":<br>  <br>  Um boi de metal<br>  Um cavalo de metal pequeno<br>  Um cavalo de magma vulcanico<br>  uma tartaruga de metal<br>  um cavalo de metal um pouco maior<br>  um cavalo de mármore<br>  dois anjos de metal<br>  uma cole??o de 16 porcos de diferentes materiais (pano, plástico, ceramica, gesso)<br>  um homem em granito<br>  uma vara de pescar miniatura em ferro<br>  <br>  se souber de alguém interessado, me avisa.

Confira os dez mandamentos em êxodo 20 e Deuteron?mio 5, nos Salmos 97, 115 e em tantas outras passagens bíblicas. O problema n?o é o simples fato de ser uma imagem, mas, sim, a atribui??o divina feita a ela. Se você orar para uma fotografia, pdeir algum milagre, coisas do tipo, estará pecando nesse sentido. Se o problema fosse o simples fato de ser uma imagem, etn?o, teríamos que nascer cegos porque tudo o que vemos é imagem. O problema é a conota??o divina da imagem substituindo Deus por outros seres milagrosos como outros deuses, santinhos e tudo que é idolatrado como se fosse divino, além da proibi??o de falar com mortos, como quando oram para Maria ou outra pessoa que n?o é Deus, sendo que Jesus é o único mediador entre Deus e o homem de acordo com Romanos, além de Jesus ser o nosso Advogado e Juíz justo diante de Deus. O Pai a ninguém julga, mas deu ao Filho todo o juízo.

Deus n?o se explica se vive. V?o aparecer várias teeorias de várias pessoas cada uma pessoa tem sua maneira de entender e compreender a Deus pois cada um de nós tivemos experiências de vivência com ele diferente. ^Você só pode entendê-lo se buscá-lo.<br>  <br>  Uma vez me disseram pra ler a bíblia primeiro antes de entrar na igreja para que eu n?o fosse manipulada e tivesse a minha concep??o. Foi o que fiz e me converti a ser evangélica pois me apaixonei pelo que Deus fazia por aquelas pessoas que eu lia. De um ser que me deu a vida, n?o aceitava a idéia de ter origem do macaco um ser t?o inferior a mim.<br>  <br>  Descobri que Deus existe, fez milagres em minha vida quando eu o procurei em amor e verdade, me deu for?a nos momentos difíceis quando eu achei que tudo poderia acabar. um sentido que n?o havia antes d'Ele.  <br>  <br>  Assim aconteceu com vários artístas que hoje s?o evangélicos. a exemplo de Rodriguinho, Mara ex-maravilha rsrsrrs, rodolfo ex vocalista do raimundos. E porque isso tem acontecido? porque o vazio saiu para dar lugar a vida em abundancia a estas pessoas.<br>  <br>  Porque elas largaram fama, dinheiro tudo por isso? è porque tem sentido, vida, e amor na vida delas.|`|DVjTjUruaa	sim deus existe , eu sou  uma testemunha , deus me libertou.  eu creio na palavra  de deus|`|LUmxH3Z0aa	você acredita que existiu Napole?o Bonaparte, D.

N?o há como provar que alguma coisa n?o existe”. Este é um argumento bobo pela seguinte raz?o.<br>  <br>  Imagine que nós estamos conversando um dia e eu te digo “Eu acredito em churínfulas. Você n?o pode provar que as churínfulas n?o existem, ent?o elas existem”. Você pode ver que isso é ridículo. Só porque eu inventei algo do nada n?o significa que sua inexistência é repentinamente improvável. é necessário haver uma evidência de que as churínfulas existam para poder se cogitar sua existência. Já que n?o há nenhuma, é mais fácil dizer que churínfulas n?o existem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Agora vamos imaginar que estamos conversando um dia e eu te digo “Eu acredito em duendes. Você n?o pode provar que duendes n?o existem, ent?o eles existem”. Você já deve ter ouvido falar em duendes. Há vários livros, filmes e contos de fadas onde aparecem duendes. Pessoas falam sobre duendes volta e meia. Mas isto n?o significa que duendes existam. N?o há evidências físicas para a existência de duendes. Nem umazinha. Portanto, é óbvio para qualquer pessoa normal que duendes n?o existem.<br>  <br>  Se pensar sobre isso, perceberá que n?o há diferen?as entre Deus e os duendes. Muitas pessoas falam sobre Deus como ele existisse, mas n?o há evidências reais da existência de Deus. Por exemplo:<br>  <br>  Deus nunca deixou qualquer evidência física de sua existência na Terra. <br>  Todos os deuses históricos foram inventados e você sabe disso. <br>  Nenhum dos milagres de Jesus deixou qualquer evidência física também. <br>  Deus nunca conversou com uma pessoa dos tempos modernos, por exemplo aparecendo em todas as esta??es de TV e enviando uma mensagem racional para todo mundo. <br>  O Jesus ressucitado nunca apareceu para ninguém. <br>  A Bíblia é provavelmente incorreta e é obviamente o trabalho de homens primitivos, n?o de Deus. <br>  Quando analisamos estatisticamente as ora??es, vemos que n?o há evidências de que Deus as esteja atendendo. <br>  Atrocidades impressionantes como o Holocausto e a AIDS ocorrem sem qualquer resposta de Deus. <br>  E assim por diante… <br>  N?o há absolutamente nenhuma evidência indicando que Deus exista. Há inúmeras provas empíricas de que Deus n?o existe. Ent?o podemos concluir que Deus n?o existe. Esta é a única coisa racional que uma pessoa pode dizer.<br>  <br>  A desculpa religiosa clássica é a de que “Deus precisa se manter escondido. Se ele provar sua existência, ent?o ele tiraria a sua fé”. Isso é esperto — aqui nós temos um objeto chamado Deus que prova sua existência escondendo-a completamente. Claro, no mundo real, qualquer objeto que n?o nos dá evidência alguma de sua existência é classificado como inven??o.<br>  <br>  Ainda mais interessante é que este objeto chamado Deus, que está supostamente escondendo sua existência completamente, está enquanto isso supostamente escrevendo livros, atendendo preces e encarnando-se entre os humanos. Como pode isso? Esta contradi??o óbvia nos mostra bem como Deus é uma inven??o.<br>  <br>  O motivo pelo qual n?o podemos encontrar evidências empíricas para a existência de Deus n?o é porque “Deus é um ser mágico completamente capaz de se esconder da gente”. é porque Deus n?o existe.|`|fLYOjTPuaa	Sequer somos capazes de provar que nós mesmos existimos; imagine, ent?o, Deus.|`|iZHm1ZBnaa	ATRAVES DA MINHA Fé EM DEUS...PELAS OBRAS E MARAVILHAS......EU TENHO A RESPOSTA DE EXISTENCIA DE DEUS NA MINHA VIDA....PENA QUE OUTRAS PESSOAS N?O TENHA O  MESMO EXITO....BEIJOS....XAU|`|wa22t10saa	Olhe no espelho e pergunte pra você quem me formou no útero de minha m?e?

2124ef00fcbd1c493aa4df1666d98d51aa	Dilema semelhante enfrentam os físicos que procuram a "Teoria Unificadora". Seria uma teoria que apresentaria um modelo para o Universo, unificando a gravita??o com o eletromagnetismo com a mecanica quantica. Mas também seria uma "Equa??o do Universo, Presente, Passado e Futuro". Em outras palavras, se o teu modelo explica como tudo se relaciona no Universo, ent?o se você informar como entrada deste modelo o estado atual, você receberá na saída o próximo estado do Universo. Claro que um computador que consiga armazenar o estado do Universo inteiro teria que ser maior que este Universo, mas mesmo assim, o modelo poderia existir. Em outras palavras, um modelo assim serviria de prova que n?o existe livre-arbítrio, por exemplo (e eu já vi um texto em <a href="http://ateus.net/" rel="nofollow">http://ateus.net/</a> afirmando que realmente n?o existe, o que existe é imprevisibilidade, n?o sabemos o que vai acontecer a seguir, mas as nossas rea??es e pensamentos ser?o ditados pelo estado atual do nosso cérebro, mais as informa??es recebidas pelos nossos sentidos, mais o nosso comportamento inerente, mas isto é outra conversa).<br>  <br>  Gergory Chaitin é um matemático que gosta deste tipo de problema, e ele já fez algumas perguntas interessantes, como "uma ra?a alienígena, completamente diferente de nós, iria desenvolver uma matemática semelhante à nossa? Poderíamos reconhecer a matemática de um alienígena e vice-versa? Quais os limites da Matemática?" O trabalho que ele fez sobre o Universo e a informa??o que existe nele levou ao desenvolvimento da metamatemática.<br>  <br>  Existem vários artigos dele, procure por Chaitin em <a href="http://arxiv.org/" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/</a>|`|03f7bc8b11f5088a59fee6f49fa86f9daa	A Onisciência é a capacidade de conhecer todas as possibilidades, compará-las e escolher entre as melhores possibilidades; Sei, por exemplo que posso escolher entre tomar café ou chá pela manh?, talvez o chá seja mais saudável, mas gosto mais de café; ambas as op??es, portanto s?o igualmente vantajosas em alguns pontos, dependendo apenas de pequenos detalhes que podem n?o ser t?o relevantes. Deus sabe o que o homem é capaz de decidir, sabe as consequencias de cada decis?o, a??es e rea??es; cada caminho implica em uma série de outros caminhos (assista a trilogia De volta para o futuro; Uma discuss?o interessante sobre o assunto); Tendencias de comportamento, consequencia das decis?es, rea??o em cadeia, tudo isto pode ser parcialmente observado pelo próprio homem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Outro detalhe interessante é que Deus habita fora do "Tempo espa?o" que foram criados juntamente com o universo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ha alguns dias respondi a uma pergunta aqui no YR, sabia que o autor da pergunta iria negativar a resposta, ent?o agradeci antecipadamente, resultado, ele n?o negativou; Ao dizer que ele iria fazê-lo, inibi sua a??o, pois ele logicamente n?o queria que eu estivesse certo em qualquer ponto de minha resposta; o fato de sabermos o futuro pode nos dar a condi??o de poder mudar as a??es alterando o resultado; assim, sendo alguém pré-ciente, pode mudar suas tendência natural.<br>  <br>  Agimos de acordo com nossa natureza; sendo atributo de Deus o ser bom, Ele sempre optará pelo bem, pelo melhor (pela melhor das op??es); Sendo ele justo, sempre optará pela justi?a; sendo Ele amor, sempre amará; pois como ele mesmo diz "N?o pode negar-se a si mesmo"; agimos sempre dentro de um campo delimitado, nossa liberdade termina quando come?a a de outro, também jamais poderemos fazer mais do que somos. Deus n?o pode mentir, poderíamos dizer ent?o que ele é escrevo da verdade, n?o, absolutamente, Ele é a essência da verdade; Deus sempre cumprirá suas promessas, seria Ele escravo de suas promessas? N?o suas promessas s?o deliberados por seus propósitos, sua fidelidade, sua onisciência e onipotência.<br>  <br>  Sou eu escravo de minhas de minhas decis?es?
