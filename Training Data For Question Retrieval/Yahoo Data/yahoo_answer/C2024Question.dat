20070522213722AAgIPL7	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Buying a car deck w/ an ipod adapter & a line in port. Any difference in sound quality b/t the 2 inputs?	allow me to expand:      I am thinking about buying a new car deck that has two main and completely separate input options: an adapter specifically made for ipod and a simple "line in" input. From what I understand, the ipod adapter requires that you to browse through your music using the deck's interface, as you are unable to do so with the ipod itself (I think it is called a "smart" ipod adapter or something).  I have a lot of stuff on my ipod, its 80 gb, so if it proves to be too troublesome to scroll from, say, Bonnie Raitt to ZZTop, and I decide to use the "line in" in such instances, is there a loss of sound quality between the ipod adapter and the "line in"?  Thanks -- Trey

I got myself a nokia N70 just about 10months ago , all was working fine , except for a few times , the screen used to get mixed up ( the upper right would come at the bottom left for instance...) Then i thought , that the problem was in those newly installed themes and i would change it back to default( once the phone acted even weirder , it would keep on closing my default music player and i had to install OggPLAY to listen to the music , now when i checked the music player was working fine , but since two days the screen still gets mixed up and just dsnt make any sense unless i switch it off and on , till it becomes normal again , and also this mostly happens aftr i unlock my fone using the lock code... Can anyone  guess what it could be? and if there is a possible solution ..., also i would like to know if my fone supports a 1Gb card , it currently has a no-free-space 512Mb card docked into it...And yes , I almost 4got , i hid sum pics usin' da FExplorer , is this hppnin bcoz of it?

20090225151145AAa2nFf	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Is there such an MP3 player with ALL of these features?	I'm looking for a MP3 player that has 4 features I consider "key".      1. Uses standerd batteries -- or AT LEAST user-replacable batteries   2. Has a display to see what you're listening to   3. Has upgradable memory - preferably via MicroSD cards   4. Cheap - definately under $100, preferably under $50...cheaper=better            I've found 2 that seem promising but they don't meet my criteria:   1. the Sansa Fuse has the screen and MicroSD slot but it's battery is perminantly internal.   2. the SlotMusic player uses a AAA battery and MicroSD cards but doesn't have a display      I absolutely NEED a user-replacable battery - my devices tend to sit for a long time, sometimes months and then I'll need them to work for days at a time without having access to a computer/charger.  I'm still kicking myself for getting a Palm that has a internal battery - it's always dead when I want it and then it takes about 4 hours to charge.            My old MP3 player was a SanDisk 256MB with a nice compact LCD that ran off a AAA battery.  On trips, I could keep a pack of AAA's handy and run it for DAYS without stopping to find a charger.  I'm still using it but I have to compress everything to minimum quality MP3 so it fits, and I'm beginning to notice quality loss from such high compression and low bitrate.

20090225152135AAY0fMY	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox Live connection Trouble?	I got a 360 about a year after it came out, that one got the red ring of death, and got a new one about ten months ago.  This one has been fine.  I got a wireless adapter soon after I got my original 360, so its been a while since I got it.  Well, my family just got Verizon Fios, and about a week afterwards, my connection in Call of Duty: WaW (the only game I play online) started lagging a lot, and its gotten pretty annoying.  I was just wondering why this is happening.  I mean, I guess Fios has three levels of internet speed, and I have the middle one, but STILL I mean Fios is supposed to be the best internet available.  I used to have Cox and that was fine, I had no lag issues ever.  My theory is the wireless adapter is getting old but does anyone have any suggestions?

I've been trying to download Bleach: heat the soul 5, I only have the demo which was a .Zip.      Would it be possible if someone could make a .Zip file for me or give me a site which already has games in .Zip? ( although i highly doubt there is a site which would have that)      By the way, I'm using an iMac. I don't know if that'll help anything though.

A venda da TIM Brasil para a Claro foi fechada e deve ser anunciada nos próximos dias, segundo fontes ligadas às companhias e ao mercado. O negócio teria sido concluído na sexta-feira, 15 dias depois de a Claro, controlada pela mexicana América Móvil, fazer uma nova proposta. Uma fonte estimou a opera??o em 8 bilh?es de euros. Um empresário do setor de telecomunica??es disse que é certa a compra da TIM pela Claro e que o mercado espera o anúncio para a semana que vem.   Os rumores surgiram na sexta-feira, com a notícia de que o presidente da Claro, Jo?o Cox, convocou uma reuni?o com os funcionários, em que informaria oficialmente a compra da TIM. Mas Cox, ao saber do vazamento, teria cancelado o encontro, alegando compromissos.A venda da TIM já é esperada desde que Telecom Italia, controladora da empresa, anunciou uma reorganiza??o do grupo, em 11 de setembro.

20070518090655AACQAhX	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	I need good cell phone advice?	My current carrier is Cingular/ATT. I have a MotorolaRAZR V3. My contract is almost over with (2 months left) and I didn't opt for the extra insurance on my phone.    Recently my phone is having major issues with the keypad. I can't access the menu, half the numbers don't work, etc... So I need a new phone.    The problem is, I don't really like any of the phones that Cingular is selling. I don't want the same thing to happen to me that did with my RAZR so I think I want to stay away from phone with the keypad like that one.    The CSR at the store told me if I got a phone that uses the 850 and 900 bands and is unlocked, I could use it with them. Does that mean ANY phone with those requirements?    Also, what are some good phones that I could use with my service?
