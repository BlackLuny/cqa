20090203145649AA2GrXY	Society & Culture;Royalty	Of all the abolished Monarchies in Europe (including Russia) are any of them likely to be restored one day?	I know that there are small but vocal movements in many European countries to restore their old monarchies that have long since been removed and forgotten.      Some Russians want to being back the Tsars.  And there are other movements in Europe.  Supporters cite reasons such as economic benefits, national pride etc for wanting to restore their thrones.      Will any such thrones be restored?      Do you see this really happening anywhere at any point in the future?

20090203151128AALqmf6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Anyone who has an opinion on Prop. 8 . . . how accurate do you find this quote?	"And that's the only conceivable point of Eightmaps: to intimidate ordinary people into political docility."  (Dallas Morning News)    http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/...    For those that don't do links, the article refers to how some (anonymous) types have taken the public information of those who contributed in support of Prop. 8 and combined it with Google maps.  The end result is "Eightmaps" -- a way to find the residences and businesses of those who supported Prop. 8.    Understand that I am fully in favor of transparency in government donations -- it's nice to know who's getting money from whom.  That is another issue, however.    Also, I am no opponent of boycotting, as long as it is civil and legal.  Heck, Christians have been boycotting for years; if any group of any kind wants to see if that works, more power to 'em!    What would be an alternative to Eightmaps?  How could it be carried out?  I know, there are radicals and extremists everywhere, and one cannot judge a group simply based on the loonies in it . . .    Thanks all for thoughtful answers.

20090203151728AApHyPr	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan Section: Why is this?	There is a Revert/convert in this section that goes under the name 'Joe'.      He has been constantly berated and some users have just been plain rude, I mean this guy is our brother in Islam and sometimes I just feel dissappointed to see the treatment towards him.      Maybe I will lose friendships for this but as a Muslim, I will not sit and watch an injustice go by without saying something about it. At least now, he won't get attacked on his own.      I just wonder, why the hostility? What has he done to deserve all of this?      It truly makes me sad because not only on Yahoo is there this behaviour, in real life too. He has a test far greater than most of us have to endure.      Maybe this will be ignored, maybe you will begin to dislike me but I only seek to be raised in in estimation to Allah my Lord.       So please answer me this: Why has he recieved so much hate?
20090203151153AAlUNZG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists does some of the latest science border on irrationality?	Quantum physics/string theory/and some of the recent scientific frontiers have been used by some people to justify reincarnation and some of the more irrational beliefs in religions/faiths. Now this runs counter to the atheist/agnostic (non-religious secular western scientific) belief in a strict material universe in which all feelings of human mind/soul are simply a result of our brains and/or nervous systems.      But some of the recent pseudoscience threatens to steer people away from scientific truths of the Big Bang theory of time/space and evolutionary biology as explanation for the development of people and our minds/feeling of soul as a result of our highly developed nervous systems which includes the brain and our bodies developed to help us best use the tools which our large brains thought up!

Well, i have a crush on this guy in my school...   READ THIS: (it's from my last question)      How Do i get a guy to notice Me?   Well, there's this guy at my school and he's super cute, and he seems pretty nice, so i kinda want to get to know him better, but the problem is that we don't have ANY classes together. Each grade in our school is split up into two parts: part 1 and part 2. I'm in part two and he's in part one. He also seems kinda shy, so he's not the kind that goes flirting around, getting to know girls. I just want to get to know him better, start a friendship kind of bond, and then see where it goes. any ideas of how to do that? :-)         anyways, until yesterday i didn't even know the guys' name, and when i told my friends about him, they told me he's gay!! Ugh!! he's GAY!! Now I'm like "duh, he's gay" (because no wonder he doesn't have a girlfriend right now! He's super cute) BUT, they didn't actually SAY he's gay and he did go out with this other  girl some years back.       DO YOU THINK HE'S GAY? take a guess       :-)

20090203152707AAQuG1A	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How many Christians are familiar with the story of Baal?	It comes from the 1Kings 18      It tells of how the people worshiped a presumably false god called Baal.      His followers denied Elijah and his god.       So Elijah devises a test. Situations are set up so that only the "true" god will be shown.       Baal's followers pray for an entire day for Baal to show himself.      But at the end Elijah steps forward and asks God to prove himself, and he does. Proves himself to the point where all of the former followers of Baal kill all of Baals prophets.      With a story like this in the Bible, you would think that God could not be proven false in this way, But instead we find that God does not come and prove himself when called.      If this test proves nothing then why have it in God's Holy Word to begin with?

20090203152110AA4HzfK	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I met this ex-bully...how would you react to them?	Ok, so I'm now 32 and I now live near where I grew up.  Last week I encountered this woman who I went to school with (when we were in our teens).  She was extremely obnoxious and rude when we were at school together.  I would even say she was a bully towards me.  She now manages her family's business (sporting goods store) and I went in to buy something.  Anyway, I didn't recognize her at first, but she recognized me when I handed over my credit card and she could read my name.  She looked at me and said: "oh, you're so and so...we went to school together" and sort of gave me an odd, somewhat condescending look.  I smiled and said "yes, and you're so and so, right?"  I recognized her at that moment.  She smirked and asked me what I did and I said I was working as a marketing assistant in company xyz.  Of course, it's nothing great and I am currently underemployed.  I felt really dumb about it.  She sort of just snorted and I paid up and took my stuff.  I didn't really interact with her much more than that and I felt like my body language was sort of lacking confidence.  I am a bit over-weight and she was skinny and blonde like she always was.  I felt like such a jerk and even regretted the purchase.  I don't think I would have gone to the store if I had known it was run by her family and she was now part owner.  Obviously, she's doing better than I am judging from her little BMW and nice, expensive-looking clothes.  She was never a brain at school I thought and yet after whatever schooling she did get, she was now working at this place and managing it.  And they also -- the family -- own a golf course and hotel I later learned after mentioning it to someone I know in the town.  She was always a vain sort of person I thought and was always so keen to put me down and make me look like a fool.  I have a lot of education, but haven't lucked out professionally.  I am planning on going back to school though, but I doubt I will ever be as rich as she is.  My siblings did well -- lawyer, doctor, banker.  I never mentioned them, although she knew them when they were kids, when I met her, but I imagine if I'd said I was a doctor or lawyer she'd been impressed more.  And then again...why do I really care???  What do you suggest I say to such ex-bullies now that I have moved back to where I grew up??

So, they also predicted the end of our civilization. if you didnt know this, look it up. its actually quite interesting.so, what do you all think? im actually not sure. because the mayans WERE a dying civilization, so, they could've not finished the calender... and they technically never said the world would end; they said the beginning of a new cycle, and there would be a big change. so, really, im not sure of my belief of that. i believe the world will end when God thinks it should... but thats just me. what do you all think of this whole 2012 controversy?

20090203152138AAuKlXf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ethical or revengeful attitude?	I have a dilemma which is eating me up and need some objectivity please.   I worked for a man (lets call him Jack)12 years ago which in turn led to me working along side his wife (Jill) in a separate business.  We became friends and  about 7 years ago when my marriage at that time broke up they invited me into their home for 6 weeks until I got myself sorted out.  I have been very grateful for this.      However, in the intervening years, I have discovered to my horror that 'Jill' was stealing from our employer. I kept tabs on it for a while and said nothing but when the amounts and frequency increased I did present evidence to the employer, who confronted her (without involving me).  She is still employed and I work with her and at the employer's request, I have never said anything and just carried on as per usual.  It appears that she is still doing a bit of stealing, but I haven't said anything.      Last year Jack asked me to work part time for him in a new business venture which I agreed to , but as the months went on, I found that his method of conducting business was completely unethical and then my pay cheques started to bounce, and I eventually made up an excuse and resigned.     I am still cordial to them but am not interested in any out of work friendship. The latest thing to have happened is now Jill has fabricated a reference for her daughter to a recruitment agency, which is supposed to be by my boss, and I just can't stand it anymore. I pondered long and hard and then emailed the recruitment agency in confidence to tell them that it is fabricated. I have not heard anything about that. No point telling my boss, as he believes that he can't run the business without her.   My question is, am I right to alert people to these unethical behaviours or should I jus be keeping my head down particularly after what these people did for me by taking me in 7 yrs ago. is it completely unChristian to be a 'whistle blower'     Even though I am aware of their unethical behaviour do I just keep quiet?  What is the most Christian thing to do because I really am confused.

I've heard this both ways, and I'm confused.   I am pro-choice, but I am anti-abortion. I think that unless a woman was raped or her life could be endangered or ruined because of the child, those are moral excuses. However, I think that if someone is too lazy to use proper birth control and just don't want to have a child or are too shamed to walk around as a pregnant teen, they should have the baby still and adopt it out. Still, the choice should be available regardless.   Perhaps we could make a joint agreement by limiting the time frame for an abortion in cases besides rape?   What are your thoughts?   Feel free to check back...I'll respond to people if they want to debate.

20090203154728AAzwZ1S	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My supervisor touches me a lot and it makes me uncomfortable. Is this inappropriate? ?	My supervisor is female and so am I. She has a lot of strange behaviors and really poor social skills, one of them is being overly affectionate. I have a few people whom I supervise and they have mentioned to me that it makes them uncomfortable when she hugs them, stands too close, hovers over and breathes loudly or touches them. I brought this up with her last week and at the time she seemed to recognize that it was a problem. Unfortunately, although it seems that she has stopped touching my employees, now she touches me all the time. It's not like she grabs my butt or anything, she just hugs me or picks lint off of my shirt and today she adjusted the buttons on my sweater--the buttons which rest right in the middle of my chest. I don't have an issue with being touched and in fact it never bothers me when any of my other co-workers or even my male supervisor touch me. There is just something lecherous about the energy she gives off. Is she doing something wrong or are we all over reacting?

I don't have a huge problem with it because i'm gonna be supportive no matter what. Anyways, should I tell him that I know or that he should check his phone videos or something?

20090203161316AAZVVBL	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm feeling trapped in this relationship, what should I do?	We've been together for a little over 3 years but it feels like we are Married. Over the past few years that we have known each other, our entire lives have been cemented around each other. We arent living together, but we are always running errands together, staying in together, going to plays together, etc. Neither me or my girlfriend have our girls  night out since it is just me and her all the time. Our relationship is almost codependent For example, I slowly lost contact with all my friends prior to dating, and now I don't have any friends to talk to except for my girlfriend's brother's fiance, or her sisters and friends which I am very close with. She is great to me and gives me the world, but when I search my feelings I know that I am not in love with her--I want to let her go so he can find someone that will love her as deeply as she has loved me. But I know if we do breakup, my life will be miserable since I won't have any close friends to turn to. I dont even have any siblings to turn to. What should I do since breaking up will result in loneliness for me, or should I just stay in the relationship? I know it sounds like I am being selfish, but I really need advice since I have no one to turn to. But what do I do when I have nobody to turn to except people that are related to my girlfriend?

20090203161642AAMcVWt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Help me with an argument against God/The Bible (Facts and such...)?	Two of my atheist friends and I got into an argument against one of my christian friends and this other guy about the existence of god, and more importantly, the truth of the bible.      I am in 9th grade and this all came about because this week is a gay and lesbian appreciation week at my school or something like that. Anyway, I sat down at lunch today to find a fervid argument going about the truth of the bible and the existence of a God. Apparently this one guy who sits with my friends and me (No one really likes him but we put up with him as he has no real friends and we don't want to be mean) is a hardcore christian and was shocked that we're suppose to be tolerating gays now. My friends and I tried to explain as best we could why we don't think the bible is true but lunch ended before we could finish our conversation.      I'm looking for any facts/statistics/websites that can help me in proving that the bible is not fact and god is not necessarily real. You may say that there is no use trying to convince someone this devoted that the bible is a lie but I am more arguing against my other, very intellectual friend who while believes in gay rights is also agreeing with the guy about the bible's truth. It is mostly him I am trying to convince because I think that someone as smart as him can be persuaded to see the logic.      Thanks,   Ben

There's no such thing as a perfect religion, so we gravitate towards what best suites us.

20090203163110AAOlQ6o	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Can someone who enables an addiction really care for that person?	My friend has sadly developed a drug problem, he used to be a great guy and his life isn't ruined yet but I am so sad that he is associated with drugs and I therefore have limited my contact to him via phone and texts until he gets help. He recently told me that it is his girlfriend of 2 years (who I have met, she seems like a nice girl) who provides him with the drugs! I was confused because I can't imagine ever providing something destructive for someone I care about. She does not use herself. Could she simply be naive and unaware of the damage it is causing, because outwardly he still looks the same, still has his job and all. Am I being overly concerned? The drug he is using is not as harsh as heroine or as soft as marijana but I consider all drugs bad. I don't want to push him away due to how negative I was about his gf at a time when he calls me for consultation and support, for ex. I told him maybe she is drugging him up to get continued financial support from him (which he provides her with) and that didn't go over too well with him but if a friend can't tell him how it is, then who can? But I need your feedback because I don't know if I am right/wrong or what?

Do most people who believe in God or go to a church or something like that really believe that homosexuals are that way through choice alone?  I know the chuch I was a part of preached that, which I couldn't accept, so I was wondering if this was a pretty universal concept in the religion world.  Are studies and research shown that homosexuality has a biological component to it completely disregarded so that they can continue to show it is only choice?  How can people believe that?  How many people really think it is a choice alone, and that that is all there is to it?

Since Jesus never condemned slavery, which was a major factor in the justification of slavery in America before the Civil War, don't you think that being a Christian is in some way dishonoring those men and women who were forced into slavery and made to abandon their old religions for the benefit of rich white Americans?      What is so wrong with the many religious beliefs of the native African tribes that you choose not to embrace one from your heritage, but would rather follow a white mans god?

20090203155449AALFvPL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In these Perilous times, are you *Prepared* *Paranoid* or un-concerned?	A thin line there is, between being prepared and being paranoid.    No one can be sure, at this point, where that line is. It never hurts to be prepared.     We do feel there is something in the near future that goes beyond a hurricane. Is it the economy? The president of the U.S. calls it a "continuing disaster." Others are using words like "depression." Is it in nature? There are rumblings -- from the earth beneath the Midwest and California to a volcano near Anchorage. Is it upheaval?     The possibility of widespread civil unrest has not been this high in a long while. There are many prospects, all of which -- if handled properly, if responded to with faith -- work together to bring back goodness, spirituality, and simplicity. No fear is necessary.    But prayer is (necessary); in prayer, the Holy Spirit will guide us as to individual needs. Should we prepare? There are indications that we should. There is the feeling in the spirit -- reported across denominations. There is also simple logic: the government prepares for eventualities; why should not we?
20090203162228AAS3iBs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you see a One World Government happening as the Bible Speaks about? ?	FROM THE ECONOMIC 2009 SUMMIT   A United Nations watchdog is concerned about the agenda of the recent World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland.       Cliff Kincaid, president of America's Survival, recently confirmed U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is being urged to lay the foundation for "global governance" by considering "international taxation" measures to loot more money from U.S. taxpayers.       Kincaid says the idea of a global IRS was included in the report The Global Agenda 2009, which was discussed at the recently concluded World Economic Forum in Davos.       "Most Americans have lost thousands and thousands of dollars, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars, because of the destruction of their retirement accounts and personal savings," notes Kincaid.       "And yet on top of that we've got these global players in Davos talking about global taxes? A global IRS?" he wonders. "Maybe Geithner is going to run that, too. These things are being discussed out in the open at these global meetings."       Kincaid points out that The Global Agenda 2009 report argues "sovereign states do not adequately address problems reaching across borders" and that "international taxation" may be needed to generate "the additional resources" for global governance.

20090203160638AA6I3te	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why am I feeling afraid?	i used to have a crush on this girl but now i think im fallen for her. i told her i had a crush on her and she didn't say anything about it. but she now talks to me more and say stuff like hey sexy or hey baby. and she always smiles at me. but the problem is me. every time she looks at me i always look away. then i see her and i want to go up to her but i get afraid or something. i don't know why. before when i didn't like her like i like her now i could talk to her al the time. but now since i like her i just can't. but one thing that makes me mad is she always flirts with other people. so i don't know. im not the type of person that falls in love or the type of person that wants love. but i don't know what to do anymore. i don't want to be afraid but i don't want to fall for her. im trying my hardest not to fall for her.

I'm just slightly confused about this because according to the rules as I see them it is NOT ok to eat that 99cent cheeseburger today or for the next several fridays but it's perfectly fine to go out and spend $30 on a lobster which when compared with a little ground beef is a much better meal so your not really sacrificing anything anyway! Maybe I'm wrong and seafood is a no no also but I use to work at Red Lobster and lent is one of the busiest times of year for them. Can someone clarify?       Thanks!!

Out of my three sisters and thier husbands and siblings.. the ratios are... 8 out of the 19 people being mentioned are alcoholic and or drug abusers. That is 42% just under half of all my family are addicts.   It's pretty bad odds.  I myself am not, and live a clean life.        One of my siblings has had a life long use of drugs and booze  Her liver is shot and literally she was told not to drink or it will kill her.  This sibling just found out one of her children is gay... and therefor using it as an excuse to hit the bottle after 5 years of no drinking.. being a dry drunk with NO AA.        I won't intervene.  My family has asked me to drop everything and fly out of state to sit at my sister side and make "her stop" drinking.  Sorry but after 30+ years of chemiical abuse... I doubt I could stop her.        It's hard to describe, but I don't want to be burdened.  I have a life, a husband who has health issues and I work 2 jobs...  My own life is full... not alot of room for this garbage.

Also, every Friday we have to abstain from eating meat.    I am not religious, I don't go to church - I didn't get my ashes. I just don't see the real point in depriving myself of meat. Fish doesn't fill me up and if I eat meat, how will it effect me in real life? Is God going to punish me if I forget, one Friday, not to eat meat.   My friends are living up to the rules and telling me to do the same - but it's really hard for me to keep track of every meal that I eat on those days!!!

And say somehow, they discover a way to tell while in the womb, whether or not a child is heterosexual or homosexual.       Say the child is homosexual, would you want that child still? What if they give you option to make the child heterosexual, would you allow them to do it?       Think of it as in the near future being able to pick and choose genes, what would you do.      Allow the child to be a homosexual, or take the treatment to make it heterosexual. (Imagine a pill can change it)

20090203160526AArDuP4	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What to say when someone says 'Hi How are you?'?	I know a lot of people who say 'Hi how are you?' (really enthusiastically) when we walk by eachother but when I answer 'I'm good, and you?', they don't answer back (they might just smile an continue along).      I take it now that this is the same as saying 'How do you do' when you meet someone (back in the 'old days' when people said this), it's just a greeting, not to actually ask them how they are!      But next time someone does say to me 'Hi How are you!' Do I just say 'Fine, thanks!' and continue along without asking them back? Doesn't  sound self-absorbed?      Or wouldn't it be weird if they say 'Hi how are you' to me, and without answering them I simply say 'How are you' back and then continue along???      Lol I am so confused by this. This happens to me in more formal situations like when I pass by an administrative person at my work!      Please tell me how I should answer to be polite! And so that I am not 'left hanging' when I ask someone how they are!

He also holds himself very feminine as in sitting with legs crossed and arms folded.      He's also bringing the word gay and lesbian into a couple of conversations as if he's experimenting with my reaction.      I mean he's 12 and watches SYTYCD with me and loves it.

You see, I'm asking this cuz my friend and I were talking about why there are so many damn bibles everywhere.  He said that the christians and catholics spread the bible everywhere so that more people will fall into the trap of believing in this Jesus character. He said they connected the government and the church together and renamed all the roman gods and called them saints...so they blended christianity with paganism to control more people than ever before. Then I said the only reason why there are so many bibles is because they keep making crap loads of them cuz christians are supposed to spread the word...Personally I wish people would just start believing in the flying spaghetti monster....

I'm not so much worried about the exact wording, but would like that same message to be conveyed. Also, anything else that would be really sweet to say would be greatly appreciated.

20090225064732AA96nFs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do I deserve to be treated like this?	Hi! I live in UK with my partner and our 2 kids +his kids. I came to England when I was 18 on my own to escape mental abuse I had to put up with for 18 years. I met my partner in UK when I was 19 - young and naive. He was a lot lot older thn me but he did not look that. When I first started seeing him he was everything - kind, funny, attractive, understanding etc. I trusted him and told about all my past problems. He helped me a lot, but I wasn't with him for his care or money - he wasn't rich, but a very nice man. When I became pregnant with his child and moved in with him, he became very critical to everything I did. I agree, I wasn't very good with things, but not that bad either. Since then he has told me - if you don't like something - you know where the door is. He has helped me to improve in all different ways and is a good dad, but he has to be in control in everything. I have to ask for permission to do everything and excuse is my personality disorder that I mention I might have, so he always says my opinion doesn't matter because I am sick. The thing is I am not insane. I    looke after kids all the time , don't go out with friends etc. Just how long my past mistakes are gonna be my present? He has pushed me, sweared at me, etc. The thing is the arguments always come to the same things - I have gone somewhere e.g. shop without telling him, I want to go to places(my adventures as he says) etc. I am too greedy, selfish etc. The thing is he always shuts me up and is right about everything. And if I try to prove my point he gets angry etc. I know he has the power because he earns the money, but it is always that I am put in kids category and he is in another - he can have the freedom to go out with friends, buy things he thinks we need etc, but when it is me I am greedy. I only had kids with him because he was different. Now I depend on him in every aspect and he is so powerful . If he through ne out tomorrow, he would tell everyone I am mad, bad mother etc. What choice have I got? I love him, but  I don't know how much longer I can live like this. Whatever I got is his and I havn't been able to earn while looking after kids. I would not like to live in a hose where all the drug addicts live, I want a life for my kids, but what opportunities single mother would have in this financially difficult time on top of this credit crunch?

20090304175616AAfN4Ur	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians out of all the sins the bible tells us to refrain from, what sin are you without?	I was talking to a friend of mine a few months ago who works at a homeless shelter. He is a believer and one day he was telling me about a friend of his wife who is gay. I didn't like what he was saying about the friend, but I just listened to him anyway. When he was done, I told him, "Do you know that you have the same sin that your wife friend has inside of you?    I think if I wasn't his friend, he would have tried to rip my head off. He just went straight off. I am not gay and there is nothing gay about me.   No that is not what I said. I said you have the same sin in you that he has in him. The only thing different between your wife friend and you. You don't desire the sin that he has. Just like he doesn't have to worry about lusting after a woman. It's not his desire.   Well I don't have that sin in me. Ok, I said. Tell me this. What sin do you have in you? What sin don't you have in you?    Let's see before you were married, you had the sin of fornication.   Now that you are married, you now have the sin of adultery since your wife is still married according to scripture. Have you ever lied before? Yes but. But nothing, you still have the sin of lying in you. I want you to tell me what sins you don't have in you. He said all of this was getting to him and he didn't want to talk about it anymore. I left it alone.    So my question of course is a simple one. What sin do you have in you? What sin don't you have in you?

20090225070151AAicI0t	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is it that Mary is seen as God in the Catschism?

That last sentence basically gives Mary the powers that only Jesus the Christ has since Paul said that there is only One Mediator and One Holy Spirit that gives us intercession.       So why is Mary seen as God when Mary was just a woman??

Sickle cell anemia means that carriers don't get malaria.  Such a mutation could therefore be propagated in a population if the benefits of the mutation outweigh the disadvantages.  It makes good evolutionary sense (a similar thing holds for cystic fibrosis and typhoid).      If a god designed this mutation, why did he only put it in some popultions where malaria is prevelant (Africans) but not others (native South Americans) where the mutation is no way near as widespread (yet would be just as useful).  What's God saying, Africans are more worthy than native South Americans?

20090304181155AAZHxO6	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What is the lesson of this story?	It seemed an odd spot for a spider web.  The rising sun's horizontal rays transformed dew droplets on its delicate lacework into miniature sparkling jewels.  The spider, about the size of a dollar coin, was busy dining or spinning; from my vantage point in a rocking chair on the veranda I couldn't discern which.  Above the second story veranda a utility wire runs from the house diagonally to a pole about fifty feet away.  The wire crosses a tall hibiscus hedgerow which borders the property.  In the past I'd observed small clouds of miniscule whitish flies, no bigger than a grain of rice, swarming above the blooming hibiscus.      Evidently this particular spider had also noticed them, and tohim they were inviting, because he had suspended his web beneath the overhead wire directly over the hedge where they congregated.  There were about two hundred of them ensnared in the web, alsong witha housefly and one small fluttering moth.      It struck me that this was not your run of the mill spider.  He, or she, had hungrily watched thismother lode of seemingly unreachable insects.  He then saw the wire, drew a conclusion, had the vision to form a plan, considered the logistics involved and brought this project to fruition.  This was a spatial speculator, a spinosa of spiderdom, an arachnid Aristotle, an innovator out on the cutting edge of hunting and gathering.  he had opted to climb either the utility pole or to the roof of the house, from thence outward on the wire to the optimum location where he'd commenced construction in the very heart of his prey's bailiwick.  I was transfixed watching this bug whose perceptions were beyond the ken of mere mortal bugs.      He'd captured more than he alone could consume... He could feed a mate, a family, the tribe, and the extended tribe.  His web site established, he could open a string of eateries, diners, bistros, fast food joints, bed and breadfast boutiques...NO LIMITS.      Three or four minutes had elapsed since I'd spied this engineering marvel.  A raucous beady-eyed blackbird lit on the wire, emitting a strident croak.  He leaned forward and focused his unblinking, yellow rimmed and ebony eye hungrily on our enterprising friend who was clambering frantically about his web.  The bird fluttered downward, hovered in mid-air, snatched the spider in his beak (I heard a crunch) then flew forward, and wrapping himself in the web, he flapped to the street below hopping about picking at the sticky threads enveloping his body and wings.  No, a car didn't run him over, nor did a cat or raptor materialize.  The bird shed his bonds and flew off.

A girl I once knew briefly mentioned a place in the States, possibly in the desert, where a person may cleanse their soul. It was a retreat or a festival, I can't quite remember. It may have been just a marketing ploy, a spa resort advertised as a place for spiritual renewal, in which case I would have no interest in visiting. But it may be a genuine place of spiritual significance, in which case I feel it imperative that I go and seek this place. Can anybody help me out?

20090304183626AA5wJ4F	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who is God and why are we so afraid?	Who is God?      Christians and others, believe that there is a higher much powerful thing that protects over and rules them, why? They also believe that in order to be saved they must convert and whatever goes goes this Gods way. The funny psychological belief is, there are various people that like to have their lives directed, told what to do, when to eat when to sleep and poop.  This doesn’t apply to everyone, they claim evolution never happened because it isn’t happening now. Well what do you call atheism?  The none belief of an imaginary ruler. If that is not enough evidence for you, what about our intelligence, God didn’t get us to the moon it was the many intelligent men who had a lack of God that belief that their action where their responsibility not a deity. The question is, if you are so convince that there is one God ruling over the earth and all of space with its little androgynies of angels and kingdom of dead soul’s who dwell for all eternity because of his ruling presence, well doesn’t that sound nuts? What little capability do you have when you cannot even make a logical decision and need your friend Fred the imaginary dog to make a decision for you. Why is it so scary to not have a God? And if you are so convince then who made God, you cannot know and say there is a all knowing power when you cannot even question his existence. “Well God is God. He is all knowing. What do you know?!”  Yes, but wouldn’t that make him wonder, that must feel lonely, lonely in a sense that he is what everyone is watching. He has no father, and no mother and he came to be just because. I can understand the fear people have, but you must then have balls in order to say “There is no God” because there is no God then we are to blame for our decisions, if there is no God than death is painful, really scary ****! If there is no God there is no after life, nothing! So why is this so scary? It wasn’t scary before you were born, no arguments or anything. Do you remember before you were born?

I’ve been to a different country for Saint Patrick’s Day and people just seem to go all out compared to Ireland, I was in New York one year for paddies day and its nothing like Ireland at all at all.       New York the parade goes on for like 6 or more hours in any weather when I was there it was snowing, In Ireland they would call it off if the weather was too bad, and the typical Irish parade goes on for like an hour two    tops!   After the parade people retire to the pub for the day to have a laugh   But in America and what iv heard of other countries they have parties, dinner parties, go the pub and drink and act like there Irish!!      My question is how come other countries seem to celebrate our holiday with a bit more oomph?

I understand this, however I am talking about the great change from one age to another that is mentioned in the bible as a golden age?  I presume it would be that based on its definition.       However, if you are educated enough to support the fact the world is going to end, I would love to hear your evidence on this issue and if you are educated enough to say that 2012 is going to be like any other year I would also love to hear why!

20090304183617AAB7nQC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How is logic or science relevant in a discussion of spiritual matters?	There is no proof of a God. There is no proof of a lack of a God, either. There are suggestions that point both ways, but those can be manipulated in any way you want. The only strong statement we can make is that a discussion of God is a discussion of a spiritual being, which cannot be measured or analyzed or tested by science.      So if neither side of the argument can supply proof for their beliefs, then why are they still demanding proof from the other side? Since when has proof, facts, science, or numbers had anything to do with matter of the spirit? Since when has intelligence determined wisdom, or logic determined love? What are we really talking about here?

20090304184042AAC86XU	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I have a guy who's 34, i'm 18, he invited me to his place and I don't know if I should say yes...?	I go skating almost every day and I'm friends with the guy who works there. Every time I see him, he gives me a hug and a kiss on my head (as a friend) and calls me sweet names, I think he's the sweetest guy in the world, he teaches me skating moves, we often have conversions about what he does in his free time and what's new and stuff and he often teases in a friend like matter. I'm also in love with this guy. Thing is, the skating season is ending soon and he said we would exchange phone numbers so one day I could go over to his place to listen to his music because he makes his own music and I told him I wanted to hear it one day. In a way I'm thrilled but in a way I'm creeped out. At first I figured when he gave his number I would talk to him and make sure it's just between friends. Now I'm thinking of telling him next time I see him that I was a bit creeped and tell him like before going to his place we should go for coffee or something. The point is I'm a bit lost right now and I don't what to do, I've asked several of my friends and I've received a lot of different advice.

I am 20 and newly out of the closet and I want a masculine gay guy. I love rock/metal types with long hair. I don't like sissyboys. I want a real man. I am a real man myself and I would like a man who looks and talks like a man, with a male sounding voice. Is there any chance I can find a man like that? Are all gays sissyboys? I love men. I want a man, not a man looking like a woman. I am a masculine man myself and I don't see the point in being gay if I should get a man looking like a woman. I have been with women before and I never had the same feeling for them. I want a brave, masculine, honest, good looking, intelligent man to share my life with. I am into video games, hunting, working out and gigs. Are there gay men like me out there without stupid hand movements and effeminate voices?

20090304184853AAAcJPB	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Has Anyone Had A Close Encounter of the Third Kind?	I experienced a close encounter of the third kind myself many years ago in the early eighties. We had just been to see a movie and stopped to eat a burger and fries. I noticed a small twinkling light out of the front window of the car as we sat at Overtoun Park in Rutherglen, Scotland. It was moving oddly so we observed it for about 3 minutes when a flash of light hit the bonnet of the car from the light and we got such a fright. We then moved off and it seemed to follow us or I don't know but maybe we were following it? We came to a small shopping arcade at Fernhill about 4 miles on and outside was a man hovering above the ground, much like we all imagine Jesus to look like with a robe on and no shoes. There was a mist surrounding him. I thought he might be a sleepwalker as it was after 1.30pm. I asked my husband to stop but he was so scared he put the foot down and escaped from the apparition. We ran into our house, shut all the curtains, blinds and made sure the door was locked tight before we relaxed. We looked at the clock and it said quarter to 3 and realised that we had lost over an hour of time and to this day it has never been spoken about but I still often wonder if other people have came across this experience or seen a similiar apparition in relation to a UFO sighting?

20090304203641AA6zRNp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to reconcile faith through Judaism and horrible events in the past?	Now I'm agnostic and atheist but have some light (and I mean not much at all, I grew up non-religious) experience with Judaism. I got some Palm OS-compatible Chassid commentaries on the Tanakh and Torah which I can read on the campus shuttle bus on the 5-10 minute ride each way every hour or two.      A common theme of what I read today, once again I might not be clarifying or understanding it well enough, was that HaShem / G-d has control over all events and that all that happens ultimately is for good purpose. In that case why is it that bad things like World War II and future conflicts keep happening?      I still feel unswayed from the non-religious stance and at most I might see the value of Deism in that G-d is there but possibly in a different universe/realm and has no influence on worldly matters. Please help, and good info would be appreciated!

I was at the campus library studying and decided to take a break.  I went to the women's studies section and picked up a book on ancient history of women.      The author, claimed that the reason why homosexuality was so prevalent in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt is that it was better for a man to be in favor with a powerful man, than to be with a female who had little if any influence.  In other words it was better for a young male to be with a man for political and social benefits, than to be with a female who can't offer those same benefits.      ______   If you like I will email you the source tomorrow.

20090304194403AAaJzhO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What if life was really a test against faith?	I'm asking a purely hypothetical question for the fun of it and to see what religious people say in response.       What if there really was a God and the reason for life on earth was a test? The test of life was if you became a religious follower or you became an atheist. God wanted everyone to go through the test and become an atheist precisely because he didn't want any people that weren't rational in his sacred heaven. God had created religion as a distraction from what he truly wanted you to believe, atheism. God only wanted atheists in heaven because he really only like people with a rational thought because the true evidence he planted on Earth was suppose to be conclusive that there was no god after all.       What would you think of that religious people, and atheists?      I quite like my idea, even though I know it's not true. Completely hypothetical of course.

20090304195142AAWEOuJ	Society & Culture;Languages	What does it mean “one necessarily precludes the other”?	If a person comes up with two answers to the question: what’s more important to know a person? And his friends asked: well, I'm not sure one necessarily precludes the other.      “Preclude” as a verb in the dictionary has two meanings:   1. to prevent the presence, existence, or occurrence of; make impossible   2. to exclude or debar from something      But in this case, it’s kind of hard for me, an ESL, to grasp its meaning.    Could you explain a little if you have time?       Thanks

20090304200331AAoIBwe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: What do you think of this scripture?	1 Corinthians 2:10-14   but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit.  The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.  The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
20090304194856AAwfLFh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come what’s truth to a religious person is nonsense to an atheist and vice versa?	We’re all human beings; why haven’t we been able to work out a standard for differentiating between real and imaginary?

I use to go to an all girls school freshman year, but this year i transferred to a co-ed one. The first time i met her, I swear I fell hard. She isn't like most girls really, she's down to earth and is really smart. She's so beautiful I swear! && get this she never had a boyfriend which is hard to believe because she looks like she can have any guy !   Well she's straight but I don't know since she hasn't had a boyfriend.   She's one of my close friends, and she knows I'm gay and cares for me. I told her I like someone and don't know what to do because they are straight and she wants to know who it is..How can I tell her, that it's her. I want to do it in a personal way like very touching (with a lot of meaning towards it). For me I could just tell her that it's her like nothing.

I don't know if it's just me but I always seem more depressed  than my straight friends. I mean my friends always seem happy while I kind of just stand their trying to fake a smile just to get through everything. I feel so disconnected from people and sometimes I'm afraid to express my true self because I'm scared of getting discriminated. I feel it's so hard for me to connect to people. I feel like because when I was little I was emotionally abused by my parents (they are indian) and by kids at school (they called me "fag" and crap like that) that my self-esteem has been destroyed over the years. I'm in college and I'm an electrical engineering major and I hate what I'm doing and I only did it because my parents wanted me to do it. I feel like things are always against me. I don't have a good connection with my parents, especially with my mom because she emotionally abused me a lot and even physically abused somewhat as a kid. I don't I feel like everything is against me. What do I do?

20090304190511AAfc6Dw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What are ppl thinking?	I just read this question about wether or not people are born gay or choose to be gay and some of the answers amazed me.  A few people made the argument that they choose to be gay and then followed that up with are pedophiles born that way or are drug addicts born that way.  Well yeah they are!  A NORMAL human being is not going to one day just decide to molest a child or to become addicted to heroin and lose everything.  It is your genetic make-up when you are born.  Those types of people are missing certain connections in the brain which makes those desires come out.  People who are drug addicts have an addictive personality.  It's all biology.  I mean I don't know all the specifics but it just amazes me to hear some peoples point of view.  I don't even know if I have a question that just got me fired up.  I guess what are everyone elses thoughts on this?

20090304185729AAaIfgN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can we circumvent Ritual?	Hello all,   As much as I have become acclimated to ritual, being a cradle Catholic myself, I am curious if there is a less procedural and meticulous way by which to have recourse to supernatural power. Being an orthodox Catholic is not exactly conducive to delving into what it would marginalize as "occult practices," such as shamanism, energy medicine, reiki, and voodoo. This restriction of curiosity notwithstanding, I have invested great time and interest in just such material, and I couldn't help but notice that all of it is replete with ritual, procedure, strict scrupulous attention to ingredient, and nearly "scientific method" in its expectation of a predetermined result. As romanticizing as this ritual is for some, I can't help but be a little overwhelmed by the nuance from one culture to another, so here's the real question: what unifying reality are all these discrepant rituals trying to invoke, and how can we simply dispense with the blood sacrifice, talisman-donnings, ornate vestments, and endless mantras to cut to the heart of the matter? Perhaps I am searching for a "purified" approach, one not shackled to any particular agenda. I condone ritual only insofar as it focuses the mind and inspires the heart, but beyond that, it seems to be laced with outdated, mythologized ravings that it attempts to solidify into doctrinal truth, oppressively enforced. In other words, ritual taken too far can become dangerous. I believe that it ultimately comes down to semantics, but I want to know that convergence where beliefs get it right. The closest article of belief I have encountered regarding a universally applicable paradigm of reality is the Universal Energy Field, of which visible matter is composed in crystallized form. Some adepts like shamans have purportedly learned to manipulate this energy field to effect change in this world, at both an energetic and manifest level. But I am wondering if any have unlocked this power by NOT subscribing to one particular doctrinal religion or strict procedure requiring ingredients and potions. So, I ask, is there indeed a legitimacy behind the belief that perhaps we should scrap the overzealous adherence to prescribed ritual so that we can become truly empowered humans and not pocketed groups of codependent, fear-based brutes? Anyone know or heard of any truth behind the claims of shamanic or voodoo power, or any other non-mainstream systems on the periphery of our warring, domineering religions? Thank you!

Since the trinity doctrine cannot be explained and according to many we cannot really know or understand God how could Jesus tell the Samaritan woman at the well: “We worship what we know,” (John 4:22)   and also Matthew 11:27 says: no one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.

One time when i was 10 years old, I pooped in my pants while waiting for my freaking dad to come out the washroom and had to put it underneath my bed because I was to embarrassed to get caught and laughed at.      One time when i was traveling with a bus to some place, i pissed in myself and it wet the bus seat too so i had to seat on my own piss the entire trip. (I was 15 years old )           One time when i was in kindergarten me and my fellow friends decided to flunk out of kindergarten to just collect some lemons off a tree near my house. So off we go collecting lemons not knowing that our teachers noticed us flunking out, we started running after seeing them chasing us but they caught us and took us back and here is the most embarrassing part. They didn't let us go off easily, the dam teachers diapered us in front of the kindergarten kids.

20090304190822AAq42i9	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Did you realize you were gay by your attraction to different people of your same sex or did it take just one?	This is all still very new to me. I realize now that I've had crushes on girls a few times before in my life, but I didn't call them crushes then. I basically just pushed all those romantic and idyllic thoughts and feelings aside, not knowing what to do with them.   Until I met this one absolutely fantastic woman who took my breath away. My feelings are so strong that when I consider pushing them down again I start to feel really, really depressed. I don't really know what to do with these feelings. I don't think I can have her. So here I am with this "mess" new of emotions. I only want her.       If I only want one girl and no other will do, am I still gay?      Maybe this is too deep for yahoo answers. Who can I talk to about this sort of thing? Any suggestions?

20090304194550AAzS9Lm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did the Roman Catholic Church find fault with Martin Luther?	Basically, I have been researching on the internet for any Catholic interpretation of Martin Luther. I can't find any explanation for why his views are in error. I read the papal bull given to Martin Luther, but again, there are no explanations for Martin's 95 thesis and why they are wrong. It simply says that Martin is wrong. If someone could point me to a website or perhaps answer on here, that would really help.       And just to be clear, I'm NOT stating that Martin Luther is either right or wrong. I'm simply seeking both sides of the coin, so to speak. Please do not answer my question by shouting out silly, ridiculous, religiously fanatic, stupid, or gospel-preaching answers, for I am not asking for those. I'm asking for answers regarding Martin Luther. If I see those answers, they will be reported. Thanks!

20090304194930AAq4Uvr	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do i RE-establish myself as a more professional person?	When I first started at the company division i currently work at, it struck me how sociable everyone was. I responded by being friendly, sociable and engaging. This is my first job and a good one too, so i was eager to fit in.       Fast forward a year into it, i've come to realize that what I mistook for laid back and fun, sociable behavior is really based on a lot of gossipping, unprofessionalism and disrespect.       This is my first job out of college, so i am not as wise as some in terms of corporation do's and dont's. Now I feel like things are out of control: I know too much about my coworkers (ex. who is cheating on their spouse etc.), and at the same time, from the very beginning, I established myself as someone who is open to this kind of behavior.       For example, some of my supervisor feels like its ok to speak poorly and gossip about my other supervisors to me...my coworkers feel like it is ok to ask me personal questions (once when i was sick with an ear infection someone actually asked me if i was pregnant!).       In my personal life, i am a positive person and dislike drama and gossip. But lately, this type of environment has really sucked my soul, leaving me sad and feeling unprofessional, out of control. I feel that in order to be accepted at this job ( being my first job out of school) I opened myself to these interactions. If i had to start all over again, i would establish myself as quiet, reserved and professional.      But I don't want to start over again, this job is good for my career. Also, i don't want to run away from this situation, i want to learn how to handle it, so i don't make the same mistake in the future.       My question is, how do I RE-establish myself as someone who has boundaries, and who is not interested in these types of work relationships? Is it even possible to do this without seeming like i'm crazy, moody and rude?

20090304200618AAerXFv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How to "clear it up" with the mother, my mother?	Okay, so I came out to my sisters about 3 years ago and I just never bothered telling my mother. Although I'm pretty sure that she has a damn clue, or maybe she knows for sure, that I'm gay. Anyway, I'm having a serious relationship now and want to be open about it. I don't like the idea of keeping this in secrecy because in order for me to have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend, I would need to be open about it. Plus, it wouldn't be fair to him because his family knows about me. I'm not even doing this for him, I'm doing this for myself because I cannot deny who I am.    I guess the question is, how do I clear it up to my mother and how do I squeeze the fact that I'm in a relationship?    Also, he wants me to sleep over on Saturday night. I've never slept over at someone's house before and I don't even know how to ask for permission from my mother. I hate lying.    Anyway, I'm 20 years old and my boyfriend is 23. I'm in college and graduating on Fall 09 (just to give you a background).      Thank you so much for any help you may give me. I truly appreciate it.
20090304200815AAigPY0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about atheists and God?	My friend is a religious person (Catholic to be more specific, as am I).  He was out surfing with one of his other buddies, who is an atheist.  This other person is always talking about how ridiculous it is to believe etc and how devoutly he does not believe.  He is a 100% atheist...or so I thought.  They were in the water on a 25ft day and they saw a big set of waves coming toward them (30 ft?) and naturally they were scared out of their minds.  They started paddling as fast as they could to safety and the atheist started praying "Please God, help me God, help me.  Oh God, Oh God" etc.  After they left, my friend (the Catholic confronted him about what he said, and the atheist seemen embarrassed and brushed him off a bit.    I totally 100% trust that my friend told me the truth.   My question is: Why do ppl who dont believe in Him pray to Him? Does everyone know He exists subconciously and they are just denying it?

NOT the doctrine that men created, a good group of people that preach to be strong, faithful, peaceful, and wise in everything. not to be ignorant and close minded like many of the churches i have been to? fellowship of wisdom between people, not a man who preaches damnation to people, but a man or people that preaches salvation to those who deserve it, and to be a great, giving, faithful, strong person?

I am gay, and I think my teacher is discriminating me because of it.      There are a few things she's said, last year i was leaving class and i had this hook thing that pull down the projector screen from the roof and i said to my friend it reminds me of Little Bo Peep and she comes up behind me and says out loud "are you actually a gay or do you just act like one?". Then a few days later i was talking to the same friend about random stuff and the topic of sexual harassment came up and she comes up behind me says "you can be accused of sexual harassment even if you are a 'gay boy'" - her exact words.       She came halfway through the year in 2008 and before that I had a different teacher and I had an A average with her in the same subject and was 4th in year 12 for that subject, then after she arrives and her off-colour comments my grade slips to a C but i still stay in 4th place cause im doing good work.       Then this year I get her again fo the same subject in year 13 and she seats the class in alphabetical order but she moves me down to the other end of the class away from everyone else, not in alphabetical order according to her own system and on our new progress reports she gave me an E and 2 D's even though ive been doing good work and all my other subjects are A's. . .      She definitely has some little vendetta against me and I want to know what I can do about it. . .

Though I'm pretty sure I lost my virginity to her, I'm wondering, maybe, that you don't just lose your virginity like that. Since we're 2 girls, there is no intercourse. I've had sex with her 2 times, each time, over 10 hours (in the night). We did mainly everything two girls can do, except oral.      Now, in the December just passed, I've had a new girlfriend of 11 months to this day. We had sex for the first time after about 8 or 9 months. It was just one day, but we did it about 3 times in that one day. She gave me oral, but I didn't, and we did other things.       Does this mean I already lost my virginity? With the first girl, it was mainly kissing and using our hands. But have I lost it to the first girl?   I know virginity is something that you choose to aknowledge if you lost or not, but still. (The thing is, I'm 15, and although a middle-teen, still young).       Thanks.
20090304212405AAbhNtb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people put so much force of the Bible, when God nor Jesus never wrote anything, and no women barely?	Okay, first of all, the scripture...God never said that. The reason God is call "The Father" is because some guy said that. No one has proof of Jesus himself saying anything. Yes, Jesus was real and still is, but I'm not sure whether he's the Messiah or not, Judaism seems equally logical. But what's up with this women hatred. God could be a girl, I believe in God, but what if the Father was The Mother, hey women can give birth, making us 10 times better than the male. Jesus is great too, but seriously, how come one of the 10 disciples couldn't be a lady? Remember Bible-pushers, God sound nothing, He just gives people and tells you want to do with your life. I like God, just not people interpretations of him.

20090304222041AArV1hb	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What are your opinions on this?	This entire universe is completely infinite; it doesn’t have a beginning or an end, so if you compare outer space to our world, there’s so much more of a difference in size that we can’t even see them without something to magnify them and vise versa. If the universe is infinite, just think of how much more stuff there is out there that we have absolutely no idea about. If you compare the infinite amount of space this entire universe holds to our brains, the size difference is obviously infinite as well and with that being said, how the hell do people think that it’s possible to completely know the right answer to anything? I mean, yeah I think about all of the possibilities there are all of the time because it opens up my brain that much more, but I’ll always know that things are so much more complicated, or maybe even more simple than what I perceive them as.       I think that the purpose of individual perception should be used for our personal happiness, evolution, amazement, and appreciation of this beautiful place that we just so happen to ironically be in instead of completely giving up our entire lives for it. Like school for instance, they force us to learn all of these things that other people came up with from their perceptions which makes us not interested enough to even remember the things they teach us in the long run, anyway. So certain people are basically not even giving their individual perceptions a chance because they don’t even have the time for it. And what people don’t realize is that we go to school and get a career merely for the purpose of gaining material success, and don’t lie to yourself. We work our asses off for the majority of our lives for a thing that certain people mistake as something valuable, even though it’s only a piece of paper that we let control our lives.  Have you ever thought to yourself like, who came up with this routine filled lifestyle and what makes it the right lifestyle to live? And when certain people, like myself don’t want to live like that, others just completely alienate us and treat us like we’re a disgrace to humanity or some bullshit like that when all we really passionately want is peace and happiness and being able to have the ability to be so carefree wherever we go.
20090304221835AAv5ozP	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What do you think of these verses from the Glorious Quran about non-Muslims?	46:11   And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, "If it had [truly] been good, they would not have preceded us to it." And when they are not guided by it, they will say, "This is an ancient falsehood."      2:13   And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.      6:111   And even if We had sent down to them the angels [with the message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gathered together every [created] thing in front of them, they would not believe unless Allah should will.      I was astonished at how many questions these verses answered about Atheists, non-believers, etc.      What do you think about these verses?

20090304221012AAWT6bG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can any one answer this, because I cant figure it out?	None of this is meant to be bashing, but a sincere question and a bit informative.   Why is it that so many Christians(especially YEC's) think they have such a knowledge on evolution?   The people who are famous in this community seem to share what they know about evolution all the time and people seeing them as reputable sources believe them and perpetuate the cycle.   examples of this is "if man evolved from ape than why are there still chimpanzees here".   If you are some one who says this, trying to be smart, and thinking this will scare some one who understands evolution, I can promise you they will laugh, answer you and tell you to get educated.   Humans did not evolve from the apes of today,  rather the apes of today and humans evolved simultaneously.   Ape ancestry is very limited in comparison to Human evolution but there are fossils like the Orrorin  Tugenensis, and Sahelanthropus Tchadensis, which may be a form of common ancestry to humans and chimpanzees but until more fossils can be recovered in the chimpanzee line it cant be determined definitively.         I mean Im studying Primatology so this stuff is my whole education and I dont even claim to know everything about it.   Why cant people do a week of research on human evolution and the relationship to apes (without sourcing any creation organization) and actually learn this.   There is nothing wrong with that.  Even the bible says its ok to ask questions. But make sure you are getting the answers from someone who actually knows what they are talking about.  I have a friend who sent me an article the other day from the creation research institute    http://www.icr.org/article/what-distingu...    (thats it).  It was written by John Morris(who is a geological engineer by the way) and I, a lowly undergrad, picked this thing apart with several areas of over exaggeration, misinterpretations,  and a completely withdrawal of information just so that this article would fit his idea of how man did not evolve.    I will say he successfully claimed Lucy(who he spoke of several times) to be ape, though this is irrelevant in the larger scope.  Why, well Homo Habilis(the first species in the Homo Genus and the least human) is, as of now, thought to be the descendant of the Australopithecines, which include Lucy.          Please can anyone tell me why so many christians choose to ask the best questions to people like this and then accept it without any more inquiry.   Why do they think these men are better suited to answer their questions than,  I dont know the library.

I'm writing a paper for my English class and I would like input from the LBGT community.  I'm not attacking anyone in support of gay marriage or otherwise, only trying to get both sides' perspective.  If possible, try to explain this: If a civil union has all the rights as a heterosexual married couple, why seek out legalization of gay marriage?
