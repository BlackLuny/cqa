Quando voc paga:  D= Fornecedor  C= Caixa    Entrou mercadorias e saiu dinheiro a conta caixa ficou com um valor menor, em contra partida a conta fornecedor ficou positiva pra quem recebeu.

Por isso voc tem que esquecer os costumes populares e entender melhor. Por isso que se diz que dbito  tudo que entra na empresa para aumentar seu patrim?nio. E crdito  tudo que sai da empresa que faz com que ela diminua seu patrim?nio.

6d7082163111cc668df3d9b134970c26aa	CUB - Custo Unitrio Bsico.     o que chamamos de valor do metro quadrado da constru??o civil.|`|xiLiB40oaa	Oi!   "Custo Unitrio Bsico".  Sorte!|`|fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	O CUB  a sigla de custo unitrio bsico da constru??o, que reflete a varia??o mensal dos custos de materiais e m?o-de-obra, atravs de metodologia prpria estabelecida em norma brasileira editada pela ABNT Associa??o Brasileira de Normas Tcnicas.    A lei 4.591/64, que disp?e sobre as incorpora??es imobilirias, autorizou o ent?o BNH  Banco Nacional da Habita??o a firmar um convnio com a ABNT, no sentido de ser elaborada uma norma que estabelecesse critrios para definir, quantificar e precificar as unidades habitacionais.    No ano seguinte, 1965, surgiu a NB-140, norma que estabelecia os critrios para avalia??o de custos unitrios e preparo de or?amento de constru??o para incorpora??o de edifcio em condomnio, que ditou os critrios de clculo do CUB.     partir de ent?o, cada Sindicato da Indstria da Constru??o Civil (SINDUSCON), em sua regi?o de abrangncia, passou a calcular e divulgar este ndice, at o dia 5 de cada ms, como determina a legisla??o em vigor.    Este custo originalmente contemplava apenas as unidades habitacionais, de 2 e 3 dormitrios, divididos em projetos-padr?o de um, quatro, oito e doze pavimentos, denominados, respectivamente, H1, H4, H8 e H12.    Quanto ao padr?o de acabamento, este encontra-se dividido em baixo, normal e alto, assim, o ndice referente ao projeto-padr?o H82N, que  considerado por alguns como o CUB padr?o, indica que trata-se de uma unidade habitacional com oito pavimentos, dois dormitrios e padr?o normal.    No ano de 2000 foi publicada pela ABNT a Emenda no 1 da NBR  12.721, que substituiu a primitiva NB-140 em 1993, ampliando a abrangncia dos projetos-padr?o, que, alm das unidades habitacionais j citadas, passou tambm a adotar o comercial salas (CS), comercial andares livres (CL), galp?o industrial (CG) e casa popular (CP1Q).    A metodologia de clculo do CUB parte dos projetos completos para cada tipo de edifica??o, onde mensalmente os SINDUSCONs elaboram criteriosa pesquisa, cujos dados recebem tratamento estatstico atravs de programa especfico, desenvolvido com base na NBR  12.721 da ABNT, sendo ent?o publicado no ms corrente o CUB do ms anterior.    Cabe apenas uma ressalva quanto aos valores apurados, que representam um custo parcial da obra, haja vista n?o estarem includos encargos adicionais de uma obra, tais como elevadores, funda??es especiais, instala??es prediais, honorrios, dentre outros.    De todo o exposto, fica claro a importancia deste ndice como o parametro mais confivel para determina??o dos custos da constru??o, apresentando um largo campo de aplica??es, seja na elabora??o de or?amento, engenharia de avalia??es, planejamento imobilirio e em qualquer outra atividade relacionada ao mercado imobilirio e constru??o civil.
C9mmeZdaaa	You have to have a credit score of 520 or greater.  If you do, you should join a group, once you have been excepted into a group you post your request to the public on prosper.com then individual lenders begin to bid on giving you a loan, one person may give you a $50 loan another $200, until you have the requested amount.|`|wR6eE6eGaa	It is a peer to peer lending site.|`|MsbqwGTqaa	It's a person to person lending site, sort of an eBay for loans. Check out the Prosper forums before you do anything. You'll learn a lot, especially if you're thinking about lending.    If you're a borrower, read the thread I linked to in sources. It contains some good info on getting funded. You don't have to join a group to get funded, especially if you have a good credit record. Before you join any group, research them on the forums and contact the group leader to find out what they do to help you. There are some good GLs, but there have also been some who don't have their borrowers' best interest in mind.

Once they do, then it takes 30 to 60 days for the update to take affect. Then it can take 6 months to a year before you score will fully recover from the debt. But one thing you must keep in mind, it is very difficult to get it back to where you were once you have let the score fall.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	As long as you are paying your bills on time, normally credit card debt only hurts your score if your balance exceeds 50% of your total credit line. So if you have a 10k line and you have 8k in debt you should pay that down so your total debt is under 5k.|`|AA12337032	Yes|`|kJYYnsNkaa	The answer to that question is not a resounding yes.  There are multiple parts of accounts that will affect your FICO score.  For instance How much you have out, how long you have had it, mixture of accounts (installment loans .vs. revolving accounts) and credit history (how you have maintained your accounts).  I had read something that the first and the third thing I said are weighted to be 70% of your score.  If you keep that in mind, you may need the balance to balance you out, but at the same time it is never a bad proposition to lower your leverage.

O crescimento deveu-se sobretudo s exporta??es, principalmente de produtos eletr?nicos. Como conseqncia, o pas foi atingido pela recess?o global de 2001 a 2002. O PIB cresceu apenas 0,5% em 2001, devido a uma retra??o das exporta??es estimada em 11%, porm um substancial estmulo fiscal de US$ 1,9 bilh?o minimizou os efeitos recessivos, e a economia teve uma retomada em 2002, crescendo 4,1%.

mN0j9Pd5aa	Todo investidor que se preze tem medo do risco que uma opera??o possa trazer. N?o importa o tipo ou o volume. O fato  que, mesmo sendo mnimo, h sempre um risco para quem investe. Por isso,  importante que o investidor saiba que h formas de se proteger e diminuir a possibilidade de ser pego de surpresa por algum revs da economia. Uma das opera??es mais usadas e mais eficientes para prote??o de investimento  o hedge.    Numa tradu??o literal do ingls, hedge quer dizer cerca. Na prtica,  uma forma de proteger uma aplica??o contra as oscila??es do mercado. O hedge significa menos risco para a posi??o do investidor, seja ela qual for, explica Ant?nio Gon?alves, economista e professor do Instituto Bennet, do Rio de Janeiro. Ant?nio ressalta que, apesar de ser muito usado em opera??es cambiais, o hedge  tambm muito comum na prote??o de pre?o de commodities. Principalmente as agrcolas, que tm fortes oscila??es de pre?os, diz.     Ant?nio afirma que o investidor que faz um hedge admite que est assumindo uma posi??o de risco e que pode n?o ganhar tudo aquilo que espera. Mas, pelo menos, ele se protege e n?o perde tudo. H opera??es t?o arriscadas que o investidor pode at ser obrigado a colocar mais do que investiu, alerta.     Os operadores e analistas do mercado, em geral as pessoas mais acostumadas com esse tipo de opera??o, costumam usar a express?o hedgiar ou fazer um hedge. Isso significa que est?o montando estratgias de prote??o para diminuir o risco. As opera??es de hedge devem constar no regulamento dos fundos de investimentos. Portanto, se o investidor observar qualquer men??o a esse tipo de opera??o, deve saber que o gestor do fundo est fazendo opera??es muito arriscadas e que est tomando providncias para reduzir os riscos dessas opera??es.    Em geral, as opera??es de hedge s?o realizadas na BM&F (Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros). Digamos que uma empresa tenha dvidas em dlar, e queira se prevenir de eventual alta da moeda norte-americana. Ela vai a BM&F e compra um contrato de dlar futuro, garantindo que, em determinada data, poder comprar determinada quantia de dlares a determinada cota??o. Se o dlar ultrapassar a cota??o fixada, a empresa estar protegida, pois ter direito a comprar a moeda a um pre?o mais baixo. Opera??es como essa na BM&F, no entanto, tm um custo. Por isso, s s?o feitas por empresas ou bancos.     Veja o exemplo de como fazer uma simples opera??o de hedge:     Mas h alguns tipos de hedge que o pequeno investidor pode fazer, sem precisar recorrer a BM&F. Suponhamos que uma famlia v fazer uma viagem ao exterior e debite a maioria de suas despesas em cart?o de crdito. Como qualquer gasto no exterior  calculado em dlar pela administradora, o valor das contas vir?o indexadas  varia??o da cota??o dessa moeda. Para se proteger de qualquer crise cambial, o investidor calcula em mdia quanto gastar em sua viagem e compra o mesmo valor em dlar ou simplesmente aplica o dinheiro num fundo cambial (atrelado ao dlar). Ao retornar da viagem, pode vender os dlares comprados e, com o equivalente em reais, pagar sua fatura. Assim, ele livra-se do risco de uma crise cambial, com desvaloriza??o da moeda nacional, no nosso caso o Real.     Veja agora como o produtor agrcola faz para hedgiar sua safra:     Vamos dizer que um produtor de milho esteja planejando sua colheita para daqui a quatro meses. No entanto, ele n?o sabe a que pre?o vai estar o produto naquela poca. Para evitar que perca muito, caso haja uma queda brusca de pre?o, ele compra uma op??o de venda. Com isso, garante que vai vender o produto a determinado pre?o, em determinada data. Essa op??o de venda protege o produtor contra as fortes oscila??o do pre?o do produto no mercado. Mas, caso o pre?o do milho ultrapasse o pre?o fixado na op??o de venda, o produtor n?o  obrigado a exercer a opera??o. Isso  uma forma de hedge.|`|ZmOjgJzlaa	Fundo hedge  um fundo que n?o se limita a investir em a??es, debntures e ttulos do governo.

Os profissionais do mercado financeiro usam muito a express?o "fazer um hedge" ou "hedgiar" significando que est?o tomando medidas preventivas para diminuir um determinado risco presente ou futuro.  No caso do investidor individual, "fazer um hedge" na sua carteira de investimentos, pode significar que ele est investindo num fundo de alto risco e, como contrapartida, vai fazer uma outra aplica??o num fundo muito conservador para "hedgiar" sua posi??o global.   "Hedgiar"uma posi??o significa que n?o se pode ganhar o mximo durante todo o tempo em todos os investimentos, por isso, quando se "faz um hedge" est se abrindo m?o de uma probabilidade de ganho total (e seu consequente risco) em prol de um menor risco, com ganho menor.     ;)    Beijinho.|`|QZiuY5oUaa	, uma estratgia de "hedging" consiste em realizar um determinado investimento com o objetivo especfico de reduzir ou eliminar o risco de outro investimento ou transa??o.

pINonh84aa	buy the stocks low then you sell the stocks when they are higher giving you a profit|`|ymqWa8GNaa	This is a better question than most realize.<br>  <br>  Clearly, buying low and selling higher provides a profit.  So you want to be buying stock when it is in least demand (for the lowest possible price) and selling it when you have the greatest possible demand (for the highest possible return).  <br>  <br>  However, buying when a stock is at its lowest, doesn't guarantee it won't continue to go lower, so it's important to make your stock purchases after the stock has confirmed it has both stopped it's fall, and is now beginning to trend up.  This is typically after a stock has made a minor move up, then pulled back a little below it's peak.  When it starts back up again after this dip, you have a higher potential of catching a move up. The same is true of a stock market.  I've been hearing people say "This is the time to buy..." for a year - only to see the market move lower.  The time to begin buying will be when the market moves out of its trading range and starts to break out <br>  <br>  The best information in print on this topic is by William O'Neill, and is titled something on the order of "How to Make Money in Stocks".  He also publishes Investor's Business Daily (known as IBD).  Grab a copy on Saturday mornings at your local book store and learn a lot from a great stock purchasing authority.|`|AA11607373	In the stock exchange, people are always buying and selling stocks. The price of a stock fluctuates do to expected demand, current demand, supply, and expected supply. You can buy stocks and sell them pretty much any time. Buying low means that you purchase a stock at a low price, and sell high means that you sell it when it is higher, making a profit. The difference from the higher sold product and the lower cost is what you pocket, minus any broker fees and expenses.|`|lAMXh0bgaa	Buy when the stock price is low<br>  Sell when its high

Y7l9w11Maa	The way I see it, you have two options. <br>  <br>  #1 Go ahead and buy the house and make SURE SURE SURE you buy title insurance.  If there are any problems or expenses related to getting the title fixed, the title company will pay for it.<br>  <br>  #2 The bank may have this title issue, but it appears they feel it shouldn't hinder your purchase of the property.  If this is an issue that leads to the house not being able to be LEGALLY SOLD then the bank is at fault and they have no legal right to keep your earnest money.  If that is the case, walk away.  They should give the money back after prodding, but if they don't you could sue.  (I've seen this happen where I live.)<br>  <br>  Your realtor would be a wise person to ask about what to do here, hopefully you have an experienced one.  If your realtor doesn't seem to know the answers you need... see if they work under a broker at their agency (they might be able to help you as well).<br>  <br>  This is just a guess... but it appears that the bank's stance is that the sale of the house is still valid.  This will not be the first time a house is sold with a title issue (by sold I mean put under contract), so even if that is the case... if it prevents you from  the closing then it would be you backing out of the deal, and they keep the money.  My advice to you would be to go ahead through to the closing...if this title issue prevents the closing from being successful, that shows its of no fault of yours.  Then they wouldn't legally be allowed to keep your earnest money.  Your realtor should know this!! Either way, good luck!!|`|EXJfoGtAaa	When a mortgagee (lender) prevails in a foreclosure action they receive a certificate of title from the court.  However, that's not clear title nor is it insurable.  They must then file a court action called quiet title.  This can take a few months.  That said, what does your title insurance commitment require?  Most contracts for sale and purchase give the seller time to "cure" title defects and if they can't the buyer can cancel or take title as is.  If this is the case, your lender will not fund the purchase if the seller cannot convey insurable title.  You have no grounds for action against anyone.  Again, read the contract.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|23SkYEw5aa	NO!<br>  <br>  This is one of MANY pitfalls when you try to steal a house.  It really isn't that great of deal . . . was it?|`|OeIhVV00aa	You better look over what you signed, if there is a clause in there that says anything like   "If" for example..... Sale is final "if" title is clear or Sale is final "if" finalized by Feb 27th. And you gave up $$ in light of, it probably also says all earnest money is forfeited, you should consult an attorney for more advice, because if it is "fraud", you should at least be able to get your money back from the bank. To the Answer you received by Real, you're a REAL JERK!|`|r67YzIv5aa	Almost ALL real estate contracts state that transfer of title must include a CLEAR & MARKETABLE title.  If the bank does not currently have clear title your lender will not let it close, make sure you get a title policy as well!!!  Sometimes if the house is on the market only a few days before it goes under contract the bank will not have received the new title/deed with them listed as the owner of record, give it a few days, they may be able to produce it.<br>  <br>    Also, the foreclosures I've written contracts on state that if the BUYER defaults or cannot close on the agreed upon date then they either forfeit the earnest money or must pay $xxx per diem until the property closes, check your contract and ask your agent.  <br>  <br>    Since you're only a few days from the actual closing date, have your agent write up an extension and get it to the bank immediately spelling out the reasons for the extension.  Make sure it is known that you are ready to close and the reason for the delay is due to the owning bank not having clear and marketable title, get a statement from your lender stating you are ready to close and send that over too.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	It is called corruption. There wasn't enough time to look at the bailout before the money was sent to these banks. The government should never have gotten involved in doing a bailout. The banks and investment companies should have been allowed to fail. These companies would have been broken up and the pieces sold off without government intervention or taxpayer dollars. I wonder how much money these politicians got from the bailout? It was irresponsible for elected representatives to give money away to bail out ANY company. It is against the U.S. Constitution for the government to bail out any company or organization. To show how corrupt this has been just look at all the bonuses paid to employees and executives for their mismanagement of their companies funds. If they were truly in trouble they would not have been spending money in this manner. We seem to reward corruption and inefficiency. Congress has too much of a free hand to blow our money. It would be great to find congressmen who would simply do the RIGHT thing. Instead we find them giving our future away along with our descendant's. Instead of rewarding these representatives we need to start putting them in prison for mismanaging public funds.
DisdrG4Taa	The truth of the matter is that it is probably as important to be selective for PA and NP programs as it is for medical programs. In most cases, while there is a requirement for a physician collaborator, many PAs work in separate facilities where their contact with the physician is by phone.  They make independent decisions based on the same history, physical exams and diagnostic testing as physicians, yet spend less time in the educational preparation. In many states PAs have full prescriptive privileges including controlled substances.    Finally, there is the issue of instructors and educational sites for the students.  These being limited results in a limited number of students being able to be educated at any one facility.  Baylor is one of the better known and most desired programs in the South Central US, so it is reasonable that they would have a high number of applicants for every available slot in the program.    In many of the RN programs they have a 1 out of 10 selection rate.  The average RN applicant for an undergraduate degree in this area has a 3.65 or higher GPA some schools as high as 3.8.    Given the responsibility and risk for the position, it still has a reasonable income potential.  Most PAs and NPs in the area near Baylor COM make over $100,000 a year.    Despite the shortened time in school PAs and NPs have similar, and often better outcomes than their physician counterparts. A PA can perform in many cases 80% of the functions (in some specialties slightly higher) as a physician in the same specialty area.    It is common for fully qualified applicants to the "mid-level" health care provider programs to be rejected based on space allocation, and only those that have shown superior ability are selected.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Actually it is med school lite.    Try Chatham University at www.chatham.edu. They have a great program and are not as selective. And while they are in Pittsburgh, they are in the best part of the city. I thought my daughter was nuts to want to go there for her undergrad degrees but it was a really nice school in what is now a nice city.    Besides her degrees in Economics and Political Science she also took an EMT certification with classes at Carnegie Mellon University a few blocks away.    And many of the students living on campus live in mansions in the middle of a national arboretum. Check them out.|`|buygiKbxaa	Well, it is like nursing.   No,  not med school. But there are not enough teachers!!!! We would not even have a PA/Nursing shortage if they paid teachers a decent wage, but they do not.   But there are lots and lots of other schools besides Baylor. I encourage you to search elsewhere. I am sure you will find what you are looking for.
ww12lItvaa	Use a personal finance software like Quicken or MS Money (is that one still around?).    You can make all kinds of charts from the data using that software; Bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs, returns, charts of profits and losses. It is real easy to do.     The only problem is the data has to be downloaded to it. For a daily chart you will have to update daily.     But a number of sites were set up to update prices in to quicken. I think there was even a Quicken site that would do it.  But to get the data you have to sign on and get it. You may be able to set it up as a scheduled task if you leave your computer on all the time or at the time set up for the download, I am not sure about that.

23vKOyBraa	My simplistic understanding is a solicitor draws up paperwork, contracts, when you buy a house etc. A lawyer will more likely help you sue people, go to court etc (although that is more a barrister in court - but the lawyer advises these things as a first step).    The lines are blurred, and many professional offices have all these, and work in together. You may need a licence to practice some of this in some countries.    A solicitor will rarely, if ever, go to court. A lawyer will sometimes. A barrister is always in court. Again, my simplistic understanding.|`|WYjbuu6saa	Solicitors are generally in Europe.

If you are 'domestic partners' (you've signed an official document representing yourselves as 'official partners') you can be eligible for health insurance together.  You can get your own insurance.  Contact an insurance agent or go online and look.  Maybe check with esurance or progressive online.

They can show wonderful photos, but remember they are only putting up the photos they want you to see, plus it could be in a bad neighborhood and you are about to have your baby soon so I wouldn't risk that.    I hope I could help! Good luck with your move and congrats on your new bundle of joy! =)|`|LrXxwtj3aa	My husband and I were looking for a property to rent about a year ago in Monterey, CA, one of the most expensive places to rent in the US.  We found our wonderful little place on Craig's List.  It was not a scam, it turned out to be great.  It was listed by an individual, not a company.      These places that you have listed have pictures shown to get you in the door, they are most likely what you cannot afford.  Call the numbers listed and ask.  They may ask for money to run your credit report which is normal.  That can cost up to $60.  But before you put any money out, ask for a tour of what you would be renting.  The dwelling may look drastically different than the picture.    If you are worried about being scammed, do not put any money out.  Call, ask for a tour of the house that you would like to rent, get the lease before you give any money and read it, than make your decisions from there.|`|df0582c8a586ce6857505af34dc84193aa	I would get a real estate agent to explain that to you.  :)
a9f02b6c0c8acb63f3163e078e0b6f88aa	Simply put:    A median is the the middle result among a set of results.     As an example, we will find the median among the set of numbers: 1, 5, 2, 8, 7.    Start by sorting the numbers from smallest to biggest: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.    In this case, 5 is the median, because when the numbers are sorted, it is the middle number.    so, if you're going to get the median household income, it could be from:    Everyone's income in America,  Everyone's income in the state,  Everyone's income in your city.|`|dOzisgEMaa	Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount.

W0buucLsaa	Yes, but you'll have to pay taxes on it if you don't organize as a nonprofit. And if you don't have nonprofit status, people may suspect that you're running a scam operation. Of course, (1) some nonprofits ARE scam operations and (2) most nonprofits do start off without nonprofit status. It may not even be possible to register as a nonprofit before you've been "in business" for a while, so to speak.     You register as a nonprofit with the IRS, I believe.

In order to get it removed, you would have had to get them agree to that in writing before you paid "the full amount" due (unlikely for reduced settlement).

Credit scores are made up of many factors, including the number of cards you have, their balances and limits, the length of time you have had them, and how many late payments you have had.   Of course, paying down a balance is helpful, but without details on the rest of your credit and credit history, there's no way to know how much your score will improve.

You can limit your search results to certain geographical areas (such as Baltimore, or the surrounding suburbs)---and even limit it to certain salary ranges.    There's one other website to check regularly---www.cpol.army.mil. For whatever reason, once in a while I find jobs on the Army's civilian job website that do not appear on usajobs.     As for the actual resume process---it can be a bumpy and uncomfortable road...but it is DO-ABLE.     Be prepared: Loading your resume into one of these websites can take 2 - 3 hours. The good news is that you can reuse your resume for subsequent announcements.

Typically people do not do this in case they are incapacitated or even die they  do not want to burden someone else with their medical bills. Sometimes these debts are turned over to collection companies that will not always give you all the pertinent facts. It may be from the collection company that you demand proof. If they do not furnish this evidence go to the hospital and demeand they show you the paper work that makes you responsible for this debt.

If fact, you can go into any sale environment and apply these rules.  Prepare your sales attitude daily!    1. Enthusiasm  2. Have a transferable belief system: If you BELIEVE in what you are selling then your customers will BELIEVE in what you are selling and they will buy.  3. Look Good Feel Good  4. Know what you want to achieve for the day and have everything you need to accomplish it.   5. Leave your drunk monkey at home! The little guy on your shoulder that tells you "hey this guy or gal won't buy" "They look too broke" "you'll make no money today" Just give it to a deserving friend and let them live in hell!  6. Have a clear understanding why you do what it is you do.  7. Last but not least, Good or bad, FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOU AND FOR THE VALUE YOU BROUGHT TO YOUR DAY AND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.

We have widespread corruption within our political system. Much of the problem comes from the government and their over zelous insistance that lenders must make loans to those who could not afford them. Banks put many of these people in variable rate loans and raised interest rates to a point where many of their customers could not afford to make the payments. By foreclosing on properties they felt that they could make a killing on reselling those properties. Instead, real estate values plummeted which put them in a position of having much of their portfolios upside down. Rather than working with people to get a lower fixed interest rate that they could afford, they foreclosed. The result is thousands of bank owned properties that were worth less than the money owed. It has been a policy for a number of years to sell mortgages. You may get a mortgage from one lender but that same mortgage could be sold several times before it is finally paid off. That is another part of the problem. These investment companies and mortgage companies were all in bed together. It was a house of cards that was doomed to fail. Their success relied on real estate values continuing to rise. When the bottom fell out of values these investers and bankers were left holding a bag of their own making.    Another reason we got into this situation is lack of government over sight. At one time our economy was strong and we mostly had local or community banks and savings and loan companies. Banks were not allowed to have branches across state lines. When that changed banks began merging and went on a buying spree. The only way to maintain that growth was through acquisitions. Banks themselves became too highly leveraged. Banks were allowed to become involved in the brokerage business and brokerage companies were allowed to become involved in banking. That was previously not allowed.     Congress was asleep at the wheel. Those who were elected to keep an eye on these companies were out to lunch and not doing their job. People like Barney Frank were supposed to over see institutions such as Fanny Mae were bought off by the organizations they were supposed to be monitoring. Much of congress is corrupt, yet voters keep sending these people back to pick our pockets.    The government is involved in more than it was designed to do. If we had a constitutional government we would have a balanced budget and a government that is a fraction of what we see today.     People have been spending well beyond their means for years. We have a government that has also been spending beyond it's means. You cannot continue spending more than you earn. That has been a problem with the American people as well as the government. The people no longer hold our government accountable for the way they handle our business. People need to demand government go back to a constitutional way of doing business and have a balanced budget.      I think we should not allow lawyers to hold elected office where they can pass or influence legislation. It is a conflict of interest. These people pass legislation or laws which directly benefit their industry.     If you want to see things change then you need to get involved in the government. Write letters, send emails to representatives and the media. Demand accountability. Find a candidate that you can believe in and work to get them elected. Don't just vote for someone because they have a slick ad or happen to be good looking. Check them out. Spend time getting to know them before casting your vote.

As long as it is continuously hold the Service Tax Registration, it should collect and remit duly following the Service Tax Rules and Regulations.    By chance, if the Person or Firms found that the turnover will not cross Rs 10.00 Lakhs Exemption Limit after obtaining the Service Tax Registration, it is required to apply for cancellation of the Service Tax Registration.

You're not allowed to touch that, now!    After that, create a list of everything you spend in a month.  List your bills first, then write down every time you get gas, and every time you buy something, whether that be groceries, non-food items, fast food, or whatever.  Every time you spend money, write it down.  Do that for a month.  At the end of the month highlight everything you didn't need.  For instance, if ate out AT ALL during the month, highlight it.  Cut unnecessary expenses by identifying the small ways that you sabotage your finances.    After that, identify the things that are too high.  If your electric bill seems a bit hefty, resolve to start turning everything off and unplugging some things before you leave.  You'd be surprised at how big the difference is if you turn off all your lights before you leave in the morning.  If you're spending a lot of money on gas, try to see how you can minimize your driving and use your gas more efficiently.  The ideal speed zone for gas mileage, I think, is around 55MPH, so try not to speed too much too!    Lastly, shop for deals when grocery shopping.  Downgrade to store brand, and shop at places like Aldi that have really cheap food.  Sometimes this can be bad for you, but I guess it comes down to your priorities, and if you're willing to sacrifice some of your health to gain some financial stability.  Don't buy a lot of cheap snacks like cakes and candy, and get meat when there's a good sale and freeze it so you can make that sale last a few weeks.  Cutting out soda, ice cream, microwave foods and convenience foods, and downgrading to store brand can save you a TON of money.    I also want to add that if you are paying off debts- a very common circumstance in the United States- try to pay off accounts that accrue interest in a few large payments rather than paying monthly.  You want to get them closed ASAP to save money, and if your debts have been turned over to 3rd party collections (like a company calls you and they say they're Company X collecting on a Company A debt...) they will settle for less than the full balance, especially at the end of the month.  Call them and tell them what you have, and argue them down 'till they take your offer.    Good luck!|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I've been doing this for years.    First of all, use public aid. Get food stamps, wic (if u have kids), utility assistance, living assistance, cash, medicare, whatever you can.     Second, make a list of all of your bills. If you have anything on that list you don't need (like a magazine subscription, internet--go to a friend's house or the library, if u have a cell phone and house phone pick one, etc).   Now find out how much you have left to spend.    Third, make a list of your weekly/monthly expenses. Cross out or modify what you don't need. Do you dye your hair? Go to walgreens not the salon or go natural. You don't need shoes and clothes every month.  You do need gas (if you have a car) or transportation money, food, and soap/shampoo/detergent. If you get food stamps, you can figure that into how much you have for food.    Fourth, make a list of items you need to buy every week/month. Make sure to add quantity not just the item.  If you live alone, you can eat very cheaply. Cereal, sandwiches, soup, etc costs very little per meal. If you like to cook or have a family, cook a full meal (a box of spaghetti and a can of sauce ($2 if u shop for sales) and freeze what you don't eat). Buy bulk, it will cost less for each meal and last you longer. Coupon clip and search for sales. I will sometimes visit 2-3 stores but will save $10-20. Dollar stores are the poor man's best friend. Not only do they have food cheap, but also shampoo, soap, razors, toothbrushes, etc. And some of them take food stamps too.    Don't neglect yourself by sacrificing things you need. But do get rid of the things you just like or want.    Now whatever you have left over, no matter how big or small, put it away and don't touch it! Some weeks/months you'll put more in, other times you may not be able to save anything. Do what you can. And the best way to stop living paycheck to paycheck....start putting time and effort into finding a higher paying job. They're out there, check out employment agencies and the government employment office near you.|`|eRbMz2SOaa	stop blowing your money on weed and hookers and you will be able to save, F*uck your mom instead you can do that for free
AEnXejqzaa	No, I am too in the same boat as you. My status was originally jan 30 and then was changed to feb 3rd and now to feb 10th and on the irs.gov site WMR says feb10th and then SBBTRAL.COM says the funding was never recieved and then 1-800-829-1954 says Feb 10th. It is all screwed up and I am really too hoping that this is a glitch. If you search through the questions there are sooooo many people going through this same set of troubles. I filed on the 19th and was accepted the 20th so according to the refund cycle chart I was due for my DD on the 30th. Looks like the tough times are gonna be tough a little longer, but I will update you with any of my findings and I encourage others to do the same. There are a lot of us in this boat and between ALL of us we should be able to ring those irs phones off the hook tomorrow at 1-800-829-1040 and DEMAND some answers.

97d87f33ece2d1c2b9f13ad8a6b488e7aa	Alessandro,    a resposta n?o tem nada a ver com matemtica, lucro, ou algo parecido. A explica??o para essa atitude do comrcio  puramente psicolgica. Ao colocar o valor a R$299,90 nosso inconsciente memoriza inicialmente o dois, e faz uma liga??o como sendo dois centos (ou duas notas de cem reais, se preferir). Se o empresrio coloca o pre?o a R$300,00 a liga??o inconsciente seria de trs centos. Ao colocar o pre?o a R$299,90 o empresrio far transparecer ao nosso clebro uma ideia de que o produto  muito mais barato que notoriamente o . Como se estivessemos tendo uma vantagem de R$100,00 quanto na realidade a vantagem  de apenas R$0,10.    No caixa do empresrio esta pequena queda  irrisria. Mesmo se o produto valesse na prtica uns R$310,00 ainda assim poderia ser vantajoso colocar o pre?o a R$299,90. Pois isso poderia atrair mais clientes e poderia aumentar o numero de produtos vendidos a esse pre?o. Mas isso  outra histria, afinal o comerciante poderia tambm compensar essa pequena perda, no pre?o de outro produto.    Isso nada mais  que estratgia de venda, baseada na psiqu do consumidor.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of ***** slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.    But one hundred years later, the ***** still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the ***** is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the ***** lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the ***** is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.    In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the ***** people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."    But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.    We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.    It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the *****'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the ***** needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the ***** is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.    But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.    The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the ***** community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.    We cannot walk alone.    And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.    We cannot turn back.    There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the ***** is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. *We cannot be satisfied as long as the *****'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by a sign stating: "For Whites Only."* We cannot be satisfied as long as a ***** in Mississippi cannot vote and a ***** in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.

This will only work if your daughter can qualify on her own for an FHA loan.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	nope...if you don't have credit or a job. you will have to put the house in your daughters name.  You can put your name on the title of the house, but if she doesn't keep the house payments up, then you will end up having to pay.  NO ONE in the world these days will actually TALK to you about a house unless you have STELLAR credit and a healthy bank acct. (down payment or not...) and really GOOD paying job for a NUMBER of years.|`|wrw92W0Taa	you could, but it's not a very smart desicion|`|eu6UQElYaa	The only way you could do that is by putting your daughter on the mortgage with you.  The mortgage company wouldn't give you a loan if you have bad credit and no job.   It wouldn't do it even if you had excellent credit and no job.     So she'd need to be on the mortgage with you in order for you to be able to get the loan.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	You could but right now the way the market is well you might be able to land a good deal, I would check every angle and make sure your protected 100%.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Probably not and, as another answer says, it probably wouldn't be a good idea.    First, you shouldn't tie up all your money in something illiquid, such as real estate.    Second, in many areas, real estate values are still declining. So what equity you'd start off with probably would shrink.    Let's assume, though, that you did use the $70,000 as a downpayment on a $200,000 house. After closing costs and other expenses, you'd probably have a mortgage around $150,000. The mortgage on that might be about $1,000. Add in taxes, utilities, insurance, etc., and your monthly expenses might be $1,500. Your daughter would need unencumbered income of $45,000 (roughly) just to qualify for the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities.    Those numbers are all pretty rough, but you get the idea.    Check with a good mortgage broker, but I doubt there's a way to make scenario work.    Hope that helps.|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	Get a good realtor or an attorney that deals in the buying and selling of real estate, but get one from the ***. of Realtors list.   Your daughter can be named as co-owner on the bill of sale and a good down payment in this economy is half the deal.  Good luck.  I did it so don't listen to those nay Sayers.  Also there are government programs that most folks don't even know about.  You can look them up on the net.  Look into the government tax sales and forecloses and don't think it can not be done, cause I'm living proof!  I bought this house 9 years ago and i am now 63.  I didn't have the best credit in the world and didn't have a job, but I found out about a program called the Chicago Bond, took a week class and the next thing you know, I was sitting in my own home.  There are plenty of government programs out there look them up!|`|hvLktS7vaa	No. You need to prove a source of income to get a loan. In this case, you can take a loan in your daughters name, get the property registered in her name. I am not sure if you can get a power of attorney in your name for the property. You can consult any free solicitors forums on the web for this. do a google search for "free solicitors forum" of "free legal advice"    All the best!|`|XzsvBhJWaa	1. Move out of California. For what you can buy at 200k there, you can probably purchase the same thing out of state for 70k.    2. More seriously - You probably need to have your daughter put the house in her name, since she's going to be paying for it, and since you have bad credit and no job. You're not going to get financing with bad credit and no job.    You probably don't want to include yourself at all when trying to get a loan, because your bad credit and lack of job will reflect badly on your daughter's attempt to get approved.     With today's economy, it's harder to get loans. Banks want to make sure that they are not entering into risky business.

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	You can NOT seize your landlords property.  I don't know why you would think such a thing is even possible.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	If the house is so terrible, why would you want to seize the property and make it your home?    I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice. However...    There are plenty of ways to attempt to do it. Basically, you'd sue the owner over a legitimate matter. For example, a lease violation regarding fuel. (Though you say say "reimbursement was promised in part." Promises aren't enforceable. Written agreements are.)    If you sue and win, you try to collect. If he pays, you're out of luck. However, if he fails to pay, you then to go court and get a lien put on the property for the amount owed. Then, as a lien holder, you foreclose. You'd have to pay off any senior liens, but then you'd own the property.    Or: Report all the code violations to the authorities. Have the house declared uninhabitable. You'll be forced to vacate it, but he won't be able to rent it. You then make him an offer for the property. You buy the property, repair the code violations, and it's yours.    Or: Simply make him an offer on the property.    As for things like the broken back door, sure, it may be his responsibility to fix it. But if it's that much of a problem, don't stand on principle. Get it fixed yourself. Especially if you're paying some/all of the utilities, it might actually save you money to fix it.    Still, I keep wondering why you'd want to buy a house that you say has so many problems.|`|Q6ig8k7Xaa	I don't live in Maine, but in the state of Washington you can never seize your landlord's property, under any conditions.    You can make repairs and deduct it from the rent if he refuses to do them.    I would be very surprised if this is even possible.
ZeDjn4cVaa	First the head of household filing status is available to a person who paid more than half of the household costs.  With your grlfriend's income so much lower than yours, it is very unlikely that she paid more than half the household costs.      I assume they are you are both parents of the children, that you paid more than half the household costs, that you all lived together for the entire year, and that you paid more than half of the support for your girlfriend and the two children.    Probably the lowest tax would be for you to file head of household with 3 dependents (your two children and your girlfriend).  Your girlfriend files as single and does not claim her own exemption because she is your dependent.

I know in our tax office (GA), that you can not claim girlfriends/boyfriends/anything of the sort as a dependent. One, they are not a qualifying relative and two, they are not a qualifying dependent. Georgia also doesn't recognize common law marriages so you can't do joint filing status.    Having just gone through training back this fall, I know there was a scenario like this we were presented. In this case, the girlfriend would claim the children (filing single)... and the boyfriend I honestly can't remember but I BELIEVE it was single as well (since you can only do HOH if you have dependents).    All in all... it really matters what state you are in because you may possibly fall under common law rules. Also.. it depends on who does your taxes and how by the book they are.      EDIT: You know.. I didn't even think to ask if you were the father. HA! Yeaaaaaaa if you are the father... I would do HOH and I would have to go check, but I want to say whomever has the highest AGI claims the children (if there is a dispute over it). Weee totally forgot about that. Also you should fall under the EIC bracket which will help too.

AA11284831	Since you are the custodial parent, why didn't you claim them?  If you gave her a Form 8332 that cuts you out of the loop for the exemptions but you still retain the right to file as Head of Household, claim the EIC and claim the Child Care Credit if otherwise eligible.  If someone else claimed them there's nothing that you can do about it.  The IRS won't discuss the issue with you since it's not your tax return in question.    If you didn't give her a Form 8332 then why didn't you just claim them?  Since you are the custodial parent you have the superior claim so nobody else can claim them.  If you e-filed and your return was rejected because someone had already claimed them you should have just filed a paper return by mail and let the IRS sort out who was legally entitled to the exemptions.  If you just rolled over and filed without claiming them you can still file amended returns claiming them for the past 4 years.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	you can tell the government and hopefully get some cash|`|baQpo0kdaa	report her to the irs tax fraud office|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	If your kids are living with you, then only you can claim the kids.

9wtpCNb6aa	Ok well i dont have a clue how much your council tax would be as i dont know the area, but it would range from around 100 upwards a month.  If youa re staying on your own, you can apply for a 25% discount on your council tax, its a single person exemption so make sure you get that as you often have to inform them of it.  Im guessing if you are in a 1 bedroom 10 mins away from a town centre then you will probably be a council tax Band A or B which would be around 200 tops, but again, totally depends on where your living.    Gas and electric vary depending on how much you use obviously.  If you dont have a meter in your flat, then ask whoever the provider is to fit one, that way, its 2 bills less each month and you are paying as you go.  Otherwise, you should expect around 250 each 3 months for electric and 150 for gas.  But again it depends on what gas usage you have and electric usage.  For example, if everything is electric, exept a small gas fire, then your gas will obviously be less and your electric slightly higher.    Remember your food shopping, could be about 120 a month, you will need the 11 odd for your tv license, and a deposit for the flat too.      Then remember all the extra cash you will need for taxis, travelling back and forth to work, takeaways, nights out, etc...!|`|REC4YgOuaa	It depends, my rent is $500.00 a month and I end up paying about $100.00 dollars a month extra for bills.

I would have thought it is unusual to be approached in this way by someone you have not contacted - that's not generally how they work.  I would therefore be suspicious.  Certainly, if they ask you for a "registration fee" or any kind of up-front payment to find you work, then just walk away.  This is a fairly common kind of scam.    The address they're using is the address of Demon, the internet service provider - but I suppose it's possible that they have an office in the same building.

O valor,confirmado pelo Sistema de Gerenciamento da Execu??o Or?amentria do estado (Sigeo), seria mais do que suficiente para comprar um Airbus igual ao que ficou conhecido como 'Aerolula'. Ou seja: em apenas quatro anos, Alckmin gastou com deslocamentos mais do que o valor de uma aeronave cujo tempo de vida  estimado em 30 anos.   Mesmo assim, o ex-governador classificou a compra do avi?o como 'dinheiro jogado fora', em declara??o feita durante debate com o presidente Luiz Incio Lula da Silva no ltimo domingo, na TV Bandeirantes.    O eleitor de S?o Paulo precisa saber quem  que est manipulando informa??es e 'jogando dinheiro fora'. Segundo o Sigeo, as despesas com loca??o de veculos e aeronaves cresceram 623,17% entre 2001 e 2005 em S?o Paulo, passando de R$ 5,39 milh?es para R$ 39,04 ilh?es. Com passagens, houve aumento de 118,5% nos gastos, passando de R$ 4,9 milh?es para R$ 10,71 milh?es no mesmo perodo.       Embora Alckmin tenha dito que seu governo vendeu as aeronaves  do Estado, as vendas n?o constam da rela??o de bens alienados na  Assemblia Legislativa. Alm disso, a proposta de Lei Or?amentria de  2007 prev um valor de R$ 3,08 milh?es para a manuten??o de trs  aeronaves e uma quarta aparece na rela??o."|`|fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	Publicidade.................!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|a19a79247cdf8987693a4460336a9041aa	faz publicidade em pro de alguma coisa, para convercer alguem a algo.|`|3e949baad3e04a154faceefe9c3e7443aa	Te convence a comprar uma coisa que vc nao precisa!

ShRQiMDkaa	I think there are two things that help:    1) Interest-only loans  2) Low interest rates    IMO, these two factors have a snowball effect... they make it possible for families to be able to "afford" more house, but they've also caused the housing market to shoot through the ceiling (no pun intended.)   In the end, however, many find themselves in severe debt and have little recource except for bankruptcy.    Another impact is that for those long-time home-owners, they got into the market before it took off and can then take the equity of their old house and put it into newer/bigger houses.    It would be interesting to know the average time of home ownership of Californians... not the average time in their *current* home, but the average time they have consecutively owned a home in CA.  If the average home owner has owned their home for say 10, 15, 20 years, then chances are, the market is unreasonably bloated and closed to all except for native californians.    As a native Californian who had grown discontent with the state of things in CA, I moved away three years ago into a much more reasonable housing market.|`|uRyCIYzzaa	A lot of Californians can't afford a home.

How do they afford it?  Working very very hard to keep your head above water.  Realize last i heard that only 5% of people in So CA are qualified to buy a median price home.    Also remember, in San Diego anyways, that your avg gas and light bill will be around $200, water another $50 a mo, price of gas for your car is hovering around $3.75 per gal.    And people ask me why I left San Diego............... doesn't take a rocket scientist!|`|37c5438da52b0ad097883ca911ce8571aa	I don't know where you are looking but you can find 2 bedroom homes way below $350k it must be the area where you are looking that is expensive.    But to answer your question here is how they can afford it easily.    The interest rates years ago used to be 11% and even up to 15% and more.  I am an agent and I've sold homes at those rates but now they are around 6% and sometimes a bit less.    So if you double 6% that makes it 12% so a person that buys a $600,000 house today is paying a monthly payment of a $300,000 house years ago see?    The payments are lower now than I've seen in years.    MY PREDICTION  Mark my word the Fed is going to raise the rates any day now and you'll see buyers that were waiting, coming out of the woodwork to buy.  Today the stock market dipped a bit on concerns that Interest rates will go up.  They know something and so as rates rise people will want to capture the rates before they go up.    A good source of info is below.  When there click on buyers and then click on FREE REPORTS.|`|5053f91f5a9b687607c0bae8d3ff12d5aa	As a CA native I cant afford a home here.Low income people that do buy homes here buy mobile homes,and they are exspensive too.My husband and I just bought a home in Northern Nevada,and will be leaving this under paid,and over priced state.Apt. can run anywhere from 800 a month and up.It depends on the size,location etc.You may be able to get a studio apt. for 800 a month.|`|X35AIW3zaa	Families regularly have both mom and dad working to be able to afford the mortgage. Minimum wage is $7.25 and the average person makes about $12.00 an hour. 12x40= 480 a week times 4=$1,920.00. Times that by two for the income brought in by the spouse = $3,840 a month. Typically the house payment for a house thats worth 350k is like $2,000 a month at the most with good credit! The remaining money is for bills food and clothing. They wait until they get a raise at work or they can refi to lower the house payments. A person that makes more than 12 bucks an hour would typically not buy a house thats 350k. They'll buy one thats 500k. And so its the same circle! Let the rat race being hehe. Apts are like 1,200 to 1,500 a month. Hope this helps a bit.|`|bffMxnQ0aa	Well, it depends on where they live.

Take ads in local newspapers, send flyers for local school music teachers to share with students interested in private lessons, and get some contacts with music stores.  I know in the states most music stores have bulletin boards that you can post information on.  Make business cards with your contact info on it and pass them out to everyone.

So far, I haven't gotten any negative ratings and my detailed seller ratings are high.  I realize, though, that if I were to get negative feedback, customers would likely interpret it as an exception, perhaps from an unreasonable person.    Are you sure that eBay would stop you from selling?  How could you raise your average except by selling?  Furthermore, isn't the damage done by low ratings enough disincentive to perform poorly?

We used them for the down payment on our first new car a 69 Opel Cadet, Great little car.|`|1P3usILUaa	Yes ~ fist bought them in the 60's and was a big help on the first house purchase.  Big memory in 1982 when bonds were offering high interest rates (20% in some cases) ~ those were crazy wonderful.    Not so grand right now however :)|`|4UaUJA3naa	Yes, my in laws buy them for our son at Christmas and for his birthday. They are still around.|`|91449a6a2eeeca321c76073f8f106a77aa	Yes... I was once paid for some work with savings bonds (when I was a teenager).    My parents still buy savings bonds for all their grandchildren on their birthdays. I have an envelope of them for each of my kids. I will give the envelope to them once they graduate from high school.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I do my grandparents had some.|`|b1vxzMZPaa	Great question, Social Butterfly girl,    I remember savings bonds well. I used to get them when I first joined the military because I had signed up to have some of my pay docked every month and have it put into savings bonds. They didn't earn interest very fast, but you were always guaranteed to get at least your investment back.     In today's day of ponzi schemes and general distrust in the stock market, I would think saving's bonds would be a great way to go. I pulled every penny I had out of the stock market and have either put it in savings with a reputable bank or into CD's. I'm sorry, I know we are supposed to leave our money for the long haul, but I see too many people getting screwed. I think savings bonds are a good way to go right now, they are as secure as anything we can hope for in our modern crisis.|`|LErmNC74aa	Sure do.  You can still buy them from your local banking institution.  I believe they mature in 7.5 years and are available in several denominations.  My ex and I used to buy them for our grandkids.  Be glad to buy some for you if you just forward me the cash--just kidding.|`|619339758ecfb9e1841f71251dea319daa	YES!! :)  When I was a little girl, my dad cashed them in to buy a house. I purchase 2 E bonds a month, 1 for my son and 1 for my daughter.. the amount is deducted from my salary. When my children are old enough for college they can use the bonds for tuition, books, etc. and there will be no taxes paid on it since it is being used for education, unlike buying a house or car where you have to pay tax on the interest. It is a very good investment.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Yes and i still have a few that were a gift to my sons from their grandparents.

You can do so for your own good but it can not be taken off your taxes.  2. Business expenses can be taken for the year you paid or the year you used the supplies.  See the section on expenses.|`|AA11555162	Savings in case you lose money isnt a business expense.
DbRhfYVSaa	This is a scam. The rule of thumb is that if he could make more money than he does from your attendance fees, he would do it himself.  Don't fall victim especially that you have very little money to spare.
Tu9S1WaNaa	Yes, the money will be automatcally taken from your checking account.  When you pay for the item, it will take you to paypal automatically.  Paypal will ask you how to fund it.  Just pick your checking account.  It is easy.  As long as the seller sees that you put it through, it should be fine:)|`|MxHIdyVAaa	you have to have a visa or some sort to use pay pal.  i haven't used pay pal in a very long time, but i do know that amazon does have an option where you can set up a bank account.  money is drawn kind of like writing a check.  also, you do have a set time to pay.  when you set an account with pay pal they will deposit two very small amounts of money in your account.  mine was two transactions of 10cents a piece.  you must then wire the money back to pay pal to confirm you are the holder of the account, then it will be set.  i'm afraid you might see some kind of penalty if you have already won a bid on ebay and this process hasn't been completed with pay pal.  good luck|`|2hE5Dvnyaa	No problem! As long as you have enough in your account.
9DKAFLe5aa	You can claim both on your taxes, but in different ways. Your daughter should qualify you for the EIC and will be a dependent.And in addition you can claim your girlfriend as a dependent. Assuming you did provide all of her support for more than half of 2008. You can use the EIC assistant on the irs website to find out how much EIC you do qualify for. Just answer a few questions and enter some basic income information.

Your girlfriend doesn't qualify as a child for the EIC.    You can claim you girlfriend as a dependent if she lived with you the entire year, her gross income was less than $3500, and you provided more than half of her support.  This means no one else can claim her as a dependent, and if she files her own tax form, she cannot take the personal exemption for herself.

9d19dpaAaa	I dunno.  A friend just filed her return and here is her direct quote...  "I would've been getting about$1100 back this year (which is concordant with my income and previous refunds) BUT NO!!!!! The tax prep program actually showed me where it deducted the $600 stimulus check."|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Recovery Rebate Credit  If you did not qualify or did not receive the maximum amount for the 2008 economic stimulus payment you may be entitled to a recovery rebate credit when you file your 2008 tax return. Review the tax return filing instructions including the recovery rebate credit worksheet. You need to know the amount of the payment you received in 2008, which can be found on your Economic Stimulus Payment Notice (Notice 1378).   Two online tools on IRS.gov are available  the Recovery Rebate Credit Calculator will help taxpayers figure the amount they should claim on their 2008 tax return, and How Much Was My 2008 Stimulus Payment? ( check at https://sa2.www4.irs.gov/irfof/IRServlet...  helps you determine what your stimulus payment was.   Read http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/04/list...|`|DGFu03Q3aa	No!

If you received the stimulus in the summer, you are entitled to it now so if you say you didn't get it, the calculator shows you getting extra refund.  When you admit that you got it, it calculates your refund correctly.|`|x6wsmJQGaa	They begin by adding in the stimulus to your refund and then at the end what you received from last year is deducted. So it's not deducted from your tax refund, but from your second chance stimulus payment.|`|CWH7lTKOaa	Not enough information to answer your question.   1-filing status weather single, married, etc  2-any dependent under 17 as last and this year.  3-income level and pay enough tax.|`|HDYYYMxTaa	I had the same question. After some research, the online tools and tax software add the stimulous amount into your refund in the beginning then subtracts it once you enter it. It is confusing a lot of people because it looks like it's taking away from your refund. It is basically adding an extra $600 to your refund then taking it away once you verify you received the stimulus check. It sucks because it looks like you are getting more back when you really are not.  Bottom line: The stimulus check does NOT reduce your tax refund.|`|8X8JbiZiaa	My son did his taxes....and it most certainly was deducted from his refund. He was suppose to get 637 back....they gave him 37.  He figured by paper just to see....on paper he shows 637 for a refund, on tax software(turbo tax)  it deducts his stimulus.

Fast food isn't going to impress anyone and neither is your job hopping.|`|ncCWCIEFaa	I am certainly no Professional when it comes to resume however there are several sites that can guide you just do a yahoo or goggle search.  My suggestion would be the format instead of listing each job separately I would list 02/05 - 08/07 as you fast food experience listing the experience not the companies in the interview is where you discuss the details I am sure there is a legit way to format it so you are highlighting you experience to get the interview then at the interview explain the circumstance but listing like you have here will be a red flag to a employer.

Clt9uTmNaa	I am in a similar boat as you.  I graduated from college in Dec. of 2007 with a graphic design degree.  I got a great paying job only to be laid off in September.   I sent out my resume to every employer I could, I was even trying to land a contract job in Singapore.  In the end, I got no offers for what little jobs were available, and even the contracts were being canceled because of the economy.  Even today, I get email updates everyday with new job listings, and I would say maybe one will pop up once every 2 weeks if that.    I ended up having to get an hourly job working at my local Pet Smart just to try to pay the bills.  I know personally that graphic designers are normally the first to be laid off anytime a company gets in trouble, and aren't treated that well in most places.  After all that, I realized that I wanted to go back to school for a more stable job that paid better.  But I only came to that conclusion because I got into graphic design for the art, but when I have clients that want certain things to me that wasn't my art anymore.  I don't really know what the job market is like for interior designers in general so I can't comment much on that.  All I've heard is that it's highly competitive.      I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you love what you do, and you feel like you'll be able to make a living in normal economic conditions then stick with it.  You may have to take some temporary hourly retail job to pay the bills in the meantime, but it's worth waiting out for.  But if you now feel like maybe interior design isn't what you want to do for the rest of your life, or that maybe it's just not a stable enough of a career for you, then there's no better time to jump back into school.  Your young now, so make sure you're doing what you want to do, because you'll be doing it for a long time.    Don't let getting laid off discourage you from doing something you love.  With every door that closes, another one opens.  Find the opportunity that is best for you now.  This is just another learning experience.|`|PwnQuNnKaa	i consider i should tell you my experiences of looking job.  First, i am chinese,there are some difference from us and our country's conditions.

Very happy to make friends with you.   tony.yao@ymail.com Yahoo messenger|`|uNQa4tXDaa	stick with it.
AleT38EYaa	I would check if you  have any type of contractual agreement with the agency.      Read over all contracts w/ a fine-toothed-come, or get one of your friends to (hey, you're a lawyer after all . . . you guys write these things up!)    If you don't, and it looks like you can take the job no-strings-attached, DO IT.  I am one of the unemployed people these days and would do anything for a job in my field.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	YOU SHOULD ASK THE FIRM, THAT YOU ARE WORKING FOR NOW, OUT OF LOYALTY........|`|T7vuRDCVaa	Dont tell me.

This site is run over by 7 year olds and people who have two pieces of advice: dump him, or go see the doctor.|`|95bHeeAgaa	It is highly unlikely you will need to pay the agency any fee.  That type of agreement would be extremely unusual and, as an attorney, I am sure you would have remembered agreeing to it.    It is possible the firm will owe the agency a fee - but that is simply abiding by whatever agreement the firm put in place with the agency prior to you beginning as a contractor.      Often after 6 months a contractor is able to be hired without a fee.  Six months is fairly standard.  If the firm does still owe a fee, it would be up to the firm to try to renegotiate.     Congrats on your offer and good luck!

5KxklhJCaa	NO    many employers will check references prior to the first interview then if that goes well a background check may be ordered. if the employer orders a background check then they are seriously considering you for employment.    if the employer is checking your references that is not a bad sign and may be an indication of their interest in hiring but it is not a "sure" sign.

eACZ1Rhjaa	They can lay you off without pay. First thing you do is apply for unemployment, it will be your waiting week so you won't get anything but apply. If you just got hired you might reopen a claim and get a check. Then start looking for a new job, even if you don't find one it is good practice.   When you get back to work only work 8 hours a day and take a lunch break. You shouldn't have to make up the lost time at no pay because they decided to lay people off.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	If it is more than two weeks you should be able to get unemployment benefits.|`|IBFlHjsdaa	And Pfizer just announced 8000 permanent layoffs. Wanna trade????|`|xFRqtKr0aa	It all depends on the terms of your emplyoment contract. If you are salaried technically the company is supposed to pay you however much money in whatever time frame that is agreed upon in the contract. If you can't find anything that says they don't have to pay you for this week, wait until you get that paycheck. If you weren't paid take it up with the labor board.|`|95bHeeAgaa	It is perfectly legal and you do not have to be paid.  The company is trying to stay afloat at this point, and many companies across the US are using this exact same tactic.  It was especially popular over the Christmas holiday.    It's unfortunate, but a sign of the times.  Good luck.|`|mHXLJKzRaa	sorry to hear this thanks alot cheney and bush    well just look at the contract, and see if it mentions anything about them being obligated or not to pay you during layoffs. and if you still dont understand, its best to talk to a lawyer or go to a labor union or some place like that or maybe even human resources. better yet, ask other employees what they think if you can, just spark up a conversation
xFRqtKr0aa	You obviously aren't up to speed with today's scams. Nigerian and UK are the most popular. You get sent a check for whatever reason, you deposit or cash it using your bank account. You send them merchandise or a money order/wire. They say they never got whatever it is they're supposed to get even though they did. Their check is canceled on those grounds and you are stuck owing your bank money. In the end you get screwed plain and simple.|`|AA10986854	i did this 4 weeks ago and they emailed me and told me the tracking number of the check i would be getting from ups when it didnt arrive when it was suppose to i called ups and they told me that the authorities had intercepted the check because it was a scam so dont do it
eACZ1Rhjaa	Finding people who both want cheap houses and have cash available in three days will be hard. I know if I wanted enough cash to buy a house I would have to sell mutual funds and wouldn't get the money for 3-4 days so it wouldn't give me time to even give full consideration to the deal. High pressure sales tactics like saying you need to decide the same minute you hear an idea are enough to make me say no.  So you need to find people who keep that much money in savings accounts and stupid enough to fall for the high pressure pitch. Maybe try a group of doctors they have more money than most people and don't always spend time considering purchases that size.|`|6469fd47e4c8756d176d1c44463e5f37aa	Run ads on Criagslist or Loopnet.com.    But the problem I see is; the all cash guys that can close in 3 days need a better price. Your own words are 70%-50% of past apprised values, that is about the value of the homes on the open market right now.    The close in 3 days kind of guy is going to want to flip those homes so he needs an even better price to make money. Other wise, why should an all cash, 3 day close kind of guy/buyer be interested?    Remember, someone with that kind of cash and attitude already has a nice home, he doesn't want some beat up foreclosure home for his family.
