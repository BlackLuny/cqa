AA11264416	no its not weird and i personally like seeing girls driving truck, especially full size trucks, its not weird or anything, i'd say to get a full size but if a mid size truck is what you want then get what you want, but no its not weird and i think its cool to see girls driving trucks or muscle/sports cars|`|hZHj0i52aa	I own a Dakota, wonderful truck. I personally think its kind of sexy but more importantly, do you have hobbies or a lifestyle that would require a truck?

If a truck is really what you want I say get one :)|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i don't see many girls with large vehicles. <br>  <br>  i don't really care honestly, personally... i'd never get a truck, but if you want one, go ahead.<br>  <br>  i'm more into sport cars<br>  <br>  i don't think its sexy, but i don't think its weird. but obviously opinion varies...<br>  <br>  <br>  actually...i agree with wow c, give him/her best answer please|`|AA12095978	There's nothing wrong with a girl driving a pickup truck, it is kinda sexy especially if they go muddin' in it!

Why? Because my Dad bought one a few years ago, i borrowed it and i loved driving it! There are virtually no blind spots, and they are easier t take care of. My car now is a foreign one = super expensive for parts. Not so much for trucks, they are everywhere! And Dad will love me when i buy one, because i love to move every few years, and he will no longer be called upon to haul my stuff :-)<br>  I know a few girls that drive trucks, i do not see an issue with it, but then, i am a girl :-)|`|Czqmo9kdaa	I think it's stupid.

w3SLNKyKaa	Could be a clogged fuel intake. Try replacing the spark plugs and making sure the fuel lines are clear|`|72ddVB2iaa	Lots of new machines need adjustment when they are brand new. It's under warranty. I wouldn't sweat it. Just bring it in. You didn't say when it was stalling. That doesn't change my advice about bringing it right to the dealer, but it would help people tell you what it might be.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	I would assume that it is that driver as it seems odd for a new bike to be idling low, although it could be. With time it may get better.|`|JCNEP903aa	I agree with jackie117 especially when it comes to the warranty. make sure you get a print out of all work they do so as to cover thine own *** that way they can't screw you. Plus the fact it could save it from an accident.|`|30jQQ9Rgaa	If this is a new bike you may need to take it back to the dealer, it may be a problem that needs their attention and you do not want to void any warranty.|`|rc8Hg8e0aa	Learn how to use the clutch?<br>  Or the Idle is low.<br>  Don't know why a brand new 09 bike would have any problems.
TbiSBXclaa	The TSX is much smaller and has less luxury features. It's aimed at the same buyers who would want an Accord, Camry or a Altima.  The TL is luxury all the way and is aimed at older buyers looking for an alternative to the 5 series BMW or Audi A6.<br>  <br>  The TSX is not a Civic. It is actually the Euro spec Accord. A fine car it is.<br>  <br>  For a young female I think the TSX is a much better choice.   The TL is more your dad's car.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	"I don't really like the new Hondas...Sorry!"<br>  <br>  And yet you love Acura which is Honda? Mr. Flanders would be quite correct, you don't really buy a Honda/Acura based on how it drives you buy it based on how much kit you can get for the least buck. The Accord EX-L Navi would be better than either of those.<br>  <br>  As for other suggestions I base my opinions on how a car drives as opposed to kit, but for the kit/drive ratio (made that up on the spot lol) you can't go past a Subaru Legacy. AWD, brilliant handling for a luxury car, and most if not all the features you'd find on those two Acuras depending on how much you're willing to spend. A top-of-the-range one would probably be more expensive than the Acuras but they have more kit.|`|AA11514788	The TSX is a nice car (essentially a re-badged Honda Civic) with an upscale interior. The TL is also a great car, though the new body style seems to be love-it-or-hate-it (I like it).<br>  <br>  The TL is larger, significantly more powerful and is available with Acura's Super Handling All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) which is an exceptional package if you face winter snow and ice. Both should provide excellent service, be maintenance free and maintain their value.<br>  <br>  Drive them both and make your pick!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6e043c568931ce877b352cc49d6bc5f0aa	Both the RSX and TL were restyled for 09, performance wise RSX is fitted with 4 cylinders engine while the TL has a V6; style wise, it is subjective but the TL looks like the batmobile; for a 20 years old, I would suggest a RSX...good luck.|`|mzyG3nODaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Depends on what you are looking for. They are two different cars, one fairly expensive (TL), the other not so expensive (TSX). The TL has more luxury features, a bigger engine, and is a bigger car. The TSX is smaller, sportier, with better gas mileage.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Get the 2009 Honda Accord EX-L with Navigation. <br>  It is almost the exact same car as the Acura TL, and is $5K less expensive when comparably equipped. <br>  It's even cheaper than the TSX and so much more car.
RbsRpcIyaa	Yep, Craigslist, under the "Barter" section.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you have a clean title to the vehicle (no liens, nothing owed or paid-off before you trade).<br>  <br>  You'd be surprised at what you see on there.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Doubt it.  What are the odds that your car is worth exactly the same as the car you want to trade for.|`|sWe0lThUaa	you can organize something on craigslist|`|wvPwc4PGaa	not sure but that's an interesting idea<br>  <br>  gonna follow this question|`|F1Qi7QzAaa	www.craigslist.org|`|hZHj0i52aa	Like the previous answers, I would say Craigslist.

hPa0x06Xaa	I don't know what the first guy is talkin bout Kickers aren't the best and Orion Hcca's are incredible. Since money isn't a issue look into Fi BTL subs. They are incredible.

1oeYPzgLaa	250 is a good beginner bike because it is forgiving unlike its older brothers.  You could start out on a 600 but its not recommended.  I started out on a 600 and had to learn the hard way while flipping my 2003 zx6r down a street(i didn't realize that they had that much power when i first started riding).  If you don't know what they can do that's when they hurt you.   Try looking at maybe sv650, fz6, ninja 500, zzr600, these are all sport touring more less, but water downed engines to make it easier to learn and ride.  They still of some pep though.  anyway good luck.|`|72ddVB2iaa	Probably the best entry level sport bike for a guy your size is the SV650. (I like the looks of the SV650SF best.)<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are brand new and probably don't have a license yet. Get the training and when you have your full license, you can take a bunch of bikes out and see what you like. <br>  <br>  Starting on a something a little more forgiving and easy to manage than a repli-racer will make you a better rider in the long run. Give that 650 or a similar motorcycle a year or so, and you will be on your way to being something other than a SQUID.|`|30jQQ9Rgaa	well if you mean a sport bike, i would say with your size i would probably go with the suzuki gsx-r750. It is the best all around sportbike.  If you are looking for a cruiser then i would go with a kawasaki vulcan 900 custom.  It accommodates the folks with long legs.|`|aZx2P50raa	Take a look at a DRZ400sm.  Nice and tall and its essentially a dirtbike so its really easy to learn on.  Iv'e been racing motocross and riding for over 10 years and I stepped down from much faster bikes to this after a run-in with the boys in blue at 130 mph.  Ive had it for a month and can say that I absolutely love it and its nice to have the ground clearance for all those pesky curbs and planters you encounter in an urban environment.|`|689Ci1weaa	+1 on the ZZR600.  Same exact bike as the ZX6r from 2002 (superbike then), but it is now classified as a sport touring bike for some reason.  Still looks good, fast and cheap insurance.  After a season or two riding it, you can trade up.  Don't go too big too soon!

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	your theory is correct and they already make them to fit your filter, they just slide up over the filter and there is like 10 small magnets on it, I've used them before and they do work.|`|AA12095978	nothing's wrong with it.  there are several oil filter magnets that strap around the oil filter, given they probably can't hold everything, but I'm sure they do something.<br>  I'd use one except I have a heatsink on my oil filter and dont' want to sacrifice dissapating heat vs holding onto metal filings that the filter should be holding onto.|`|TEJoVBnOaa	It would have to be a fairly strong magnet depending the the thickness and material of the filter itself.  The other key point is not all metal in an engine will be attracted to the magnet.  For instance if the block is aluminum a magnet will not trap any filings from the block.|`|ExQGD2uwaa	Oil-filter casings may not be a magnetic material.  They make magnetic oil drain plugs, you know.|`|AA11264416	well im not sure if this is on every car/truck but my truck has a little magnet on the end of the drain plug in the oil pan and that would end up stopping any metal fillings from even getting to the filter let alone the rest of the engine, the magnet is pretty strong to, came like that stock i would imagine, but like i said im not sure how many other vehicles has that on the drain plug
7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Yes, it is just a bolt that holds the pulley in place.  I assume you know how to take the belt off to get to the pulley easier, then remove the bolt to that pulley, and reverse order to put it all back together.|`|AA10050255	The idler pulley is spring loaded to keep the belt tensioned. first thing is to see if you need to put a 3/8 or 1/2 square drive in the arm to go against the spring to take the belt off. Once the belt is off, just find the bolt(s) holding the pulley on the block. Installation is the reverse. One final thing, perhaps if you have the $, put a new belt on too. Maybe you  can check Expert Village for a video on this job.
z41rqinfaa	The first poster is correct. A 6.0L uses the "Torqshift" (5R110W) 5-Speed Automatic transmission, while the 7.3L uses the 4R100 4-Speed Automatic transmission. <br>  <br>  But, since you've clarified that you are inquiring about a MANUAL transmission, the answer is NO. The reason being that the bellhousing bolt patterns are completely different. Yes, they both the 6-Speed ZF transmissons, but the case is different between the two due to aforementioned bellhousing bolt pattern differences.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  The one behind the 6.0L is a TorqueFlight 5-speed auto.

PvlpJ1IFaa	its a lot better with a wagon type or suv type. More air gets to it cuz its a open cap.

Wait until the last minute to plead Not Guilty and send the ticket in (return it just before the due date),  which gives you more time to get the money up. You will be given a court date. When you go to court, then you can plead Guilty and given a date by which the ticket has to be paid, which will probably be 14-30 days. I cannot tell you how to get the money, all I can tell you is how to procrastinate and give yourself time to get the money up.

ppM3JxgWaa	Oil in the cylinder could have come from a lot of different things.  It could be a sign of a serious problem or just something simple.  Does your car smoke when you run it?  White or Blue smoke is usually a sign that you have a blown head gasket or other major problem.  If your piston rings are worn and/or you have overfilled your crankcase you could have oil seep into the combustion chamber.  Oil could also be leaking down into the sparkplug housing from somewhere else on the engine. How important is using the car for the next 3 weeks versus the possibility of rebuilding or replacing the engine?  If you are going to drive it, make sure that you are checking your fluid levels and filling them to the proper level before you drive it.  If you notice a major decrease in oil level over a small period of time or a pool of oil under your car when you move it, don't drive it.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	It would be a good ideal to say what kind vehicle it is. It the plugs go through the valve cover then it is not a head gasket. It is a valve cover seal. It the plugs go in the side of the head. It is most likely a valve cover gasket. The head gasket is below the head and between the engine block.<br>  Valve cover gaskets and seal do leak a little with age. They're cheap to replace than a head gasket. The cost comes in getting down to them with out the item that hap the be moved out of the way. <br>  As long as the leak is not six drops per minute. You don't have a leak. the vehicle sound fine to drive like it is. With no damage to the engine.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Might just be oil that leaked out of the valve cover gasket or spilled over from when it was filled at last oil change.|`|F6YPGh9Raa	from my understanding, that is not your head gasket, your head gasket has to do with your water pressure, and cooling system......if you have oil in your plugs could be a leak in your piston rings..i don't know how much oil you are losing, over what period of time...i suggest you check your oil level every day, if you continue to drive the vehicle, i don't believe it will do harm for a couple of weeks, however i'd ask a mechanic............if you are losing oil you will throw a rod.........engine gone!<br>  good luck!?|`|aQKTSU8iaa	That sometimes happens when too much oil is added.

B9DUiDyDaa	I've seen this before when aftermarket pads are used. This condition could also occur if the rotors where not resurfaced, if they over tightened emergency brake, and the rotors and pads could be contaminated from the technician's hands or leaky calipers. Your brakes should not be noisy and should most definitely stop. I would get my money back and go to a dealer. They have professionals and oem brake pads.|`|b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	it's not normal have them check it again|`|9SgD78JIaa	Did they change the brake pads too?? You should always get new brake pads when getting your rotors replaced or resurfaced, since your old pads, which have been grooved to  your rotors old surface, wont match up and will definitely make noise. <br>  <br>  I doubt your rotors can be resurfaced again, I'd go back to good year and ask them why they didn't suggest new pads, too. Maybe you can get em to replace them for free.

uDuwc7Yoaa	Your deck has a simple mosfet (a fancy transistor) for an amplifier. Cd players will only max out at about ~25 watts rms because there's no room inside the casing to put a transformer to step up the voltage to get higher wattage, plus that transformer & more transistors etc would generate too much heat, & destroy things.<br>  Ok, the mosfet amplifies the deck's preamp signal to make it louder OR an external amp would amplify that same preamp signal to make it louder.<br>  Basically, if you turn up the volume to max on any deck, it's going to distort. But, anywhere up to about 3/4 volume will be pretty clean. So if you add an amp, it will amplify that clean-ness and hopefully get loud enough to suit your taste before the sound gets cranked to max and distorts. Plus, the more sophisticated the external amp is, the more of your music can be reproduced.<br>  Now then, if you're someone who doesn't like your music super loud, you probably won't benefit much from an amp.|`|02pXczeGaa	making your house like a night club .|`|oJr0Suzwaa	An amp (short for amplifier) is used to increase the power being sent to the speaker - which makes the sound output louder.<br>  <br>  The stock speakers that are in your vehicle are designed to be a match with the stock stereo.

gEw83TRTaa	Oh how I love this.  The "crooked salesman pulled a fast one."  Why? because the economy took a downturn, and lenders tightened their loan requirements?  Have you not paid attention to the news?  You sure didnt care if there was a "fast one" involved when you got that car you wanted so badly.<br>  <br>  There is a huge credit crunch right now.  Lenders have really tightened up on what they will lend, and to whom.  Where a 700 score was a slam dunk a year ago, its not so much right now.  I am seeing people who would have just signed and driven away last year get turned down today.<br>  <br>  Add to that, cars depreciate.  I am sure you owe more on the car than it is worth - most of us who financed do.  <br>  <br>  If the bank you are currently financed through will not rewrite the loan, then its doubtful anyone else will either.  They know your car payment history best, and they aren't willing to redo this.  So its unlikely another lender will either.<br>  <br>  And stop blaming that sneaky old car salesman for a contract you willingly signed.  It takes two parties to make a deal.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Haven't you heard, there's a terrible credit crunch now? It is much harder now to qualify for a loan now than it was last year. Lenders have tightened down on requirements so that many of the people who were able to squeak by before can't do it now. Furthermore, if you are upside down on your loan (owe more than the car is worth), forget it. Lenders are not lending more than a car is worth now, where last year it was common.

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It sounds like the piston rings are binding in the cylinder. <br>  Perhaps you failed to check the end gap on the rings or the cylinders have a ridge binding against the new top ring(s), Are the rings all you did - are there some new bearings involved here?<br>  Regardless, unless to want to totally mess this block up by forcing it to rotate, the engine has to come back out and the reason as to why it's bound up has to be repaired.<br>  You were in a hurry....here's an excellent bit of advice from an old timer.......you never seem to have time to do a job right, but you will aways find the time to do it over.|`|XKYJk6Tcaa	your probably up the well know creek without a paddle. unless you want to work with the engine in the car.

So I would take the engine back out and tear it down it is allot easier than working on it in the car.|`|67hPxc5Gaa	I don't see how that can happen.  When you put the pistons in their bores, you should have been able to push them down by hand.  If they were binding, you would have had a hard time pushing them though their bores.  If the rings were oversized, you would've had to force them to even start them into the cylinder. You have to turn the crank at some point when installing the pistons to clear the big end of the rod from hitting the bottom of the cylinder.  Did you notice if it was hard to turn then?<br>  <br>  Did you put the bearing caps in the correct place and orientation?  If even one is turned around or installed in the wrong place it'll bind just like you're saying.     <br>  <br>  I would make sure that it's the engine first, did you force the transmission on?  Is it still in gear?  If you can get lower the oil pan enough, you can loosen the rod bolts and/or mains and try to turn the engine.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Guess your gonna have to pull it, and find out what is binding up the motor.

If you purchase the supplemental insurance on the vehicle and you get into an accident you do not have report this to your insurance company.  You do need to report it to the rental company and file a police report.  They will take care of the damage as long as you pay your entire rental bill.  If you are at fault in the accident your insurance company may find out if they run your driving record so its kind of hit and miss on that.

If you notice any gaps or crookedness in those areas stay away from it- its most likely been in a major accident at some point.<br>  * Stick your head under it- look for any pools of oil or other fluid anywhere- that can idicate problems.<br>  * Find out how many owners the car has had and ask about the history.<br>  <br>  Finally if you can get it checked by a mechanic if you can- although thats not full proof<br>  <br>  - I just thought- check the service log to check that it has been regularly serviced and maintained.|`|YSmrUZ7Oaa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com
mohbyLWOaa	needs a little tune up.  that means plugs, plug wires, distributor cap, air filter, fuel filter, maybe a little fuel injector cleaner, possibly an O2 sensor.  These things will usually get it going a little smoother and more efficient and they're all things you can usually do without any fancy tools.  Just go to a napa or an auto zone and they may even help you install this stuff too or at least tell you how or if you can yourself.  As for the brake pads, you probably need new rotors.  this is the disc that the pads are making contact with to stop the car.  If theyre not too chewed up they can be resurfaced for about half the price of new rotors.  But if you need four new rotors plan on spending around $400.  Good luck!|`|fPpmgxjuaa	wowsers!!!<br>  u should try driving slower and not jamming on the breaks...if u drive fast..also try changing the rotors if u havent done that o and the calipers cuz they might b sticking...and the idle thing could b a couple thing...sometimes you can adjust it on some cars...but i dont know on that one...but most def have someone that know what they doin look at it..|`|0fdtmVmvaa	This is why people should not touch their cars if they don't know what they're doing.  When you replaced your brake pads, where the calipers moving freely? Did you preform a slider service? Probably not.  Take it to a shop to see what is going on.|`|BCOczNV6aa	your rotors could cause your pads to go bad and your rpm is high because your fuel and air mixture is to high or you may need a mass air flow sensor|`|0TiCSGKtaa	have a profesional mechanic look at it that is definately not normal|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	That's what is wrong. It is idling so fast that you are wearing the brakes out holding it back and stopping it. Idle it down to about 850 rpm's and replace the pads again.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	your calipers could need replacement or rebuild, as they might very well be seized... you are likely cooking your rotors also if this is the case... either that or you are a brake pedal rider...do you "THINK" that you just hover over the brake pedal with your left foot? If so, here's a tip...<br>  DONT DO THAT... just touching the pedal can engage the calipers...|`|F6YPGh9Raa	i don't know about your brakes, if you change them yourself....i'd go for "lifetime" guaranteed pads.......this way it won't cost your more in the long run cept your time, as for your idle perhaps you 02 sensor needs to be replaced, and or your fuels filter(s).....also your timing may be way off!?<br>  good luck!?|`|KSznsAGIaa	the fast idle speed IS the reason for the pre-mature brake wear. also, are you cleaning and lubricating all the brake hardware, caliper slides, etc, or just slapping pads on it?|`|bvCkplELaa	tim and taf are correct, it could be hundreds of things, I would get it to a shop that does free brake inspections and get it checked|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Idle is definitely off.

I assume you are taking the basic rider course then.  They basically introduce you into the world of riding and see if you like it.  If so they continue on with safety and such. They will show you slow turns and emergency braking.  A lot more is shown in the intermediate riding class and expert class but you can take those later.  The bikes they use are very easy to control. Usually they consist of 200's, 250,s  sometimes 400's and up With any common sense and practice you will do fine.|`|JCNEP903aa	talk to an old biker about keepin' your head on your shoulders by maintaining the "right" attitude and respect of the bike. walkin', talkin' knowledge...it's free & they don't mind teachin' you younger guys the ropes. with no jerkin' you around. can I get an amen?|`|aZx2P50raa	I would check out Harley's Riders Edge program, they supply the bike and the course is designed for people who have never ridden before.

You are looking at it wrong.<br>  <br>  Check your ego and attitude at the door. This could save your life. Relax and enjoy the class.<br>  <br>  I have ridden off and on for years but 2 years ago i took a course from thr Motorcycle safety Foundation. Learned a lot and was sick of riding bikes at the end of the 3 day. Was a great learning experience and for a long time when i was on the road, I could hear the instructors yelling at me for doing bad things I did out of habit. Pretty funny actually.<br>  <br>  A woman i took the class with had never ridden. At the end of the class she aced the riding test and the written test. You take the cards they give you to the DMVand you automatically have a motorcycle endoursement on your license!<br>  <br>  Enjoy it.
XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  You will be notified if the police officials have any questions for you.  If you are a witness and you have any important information to give to help the process along then yes you will be notified.  Typically they only notify you if there is a major development in the case and you are essential to the issue that was caused.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Yes, the insurance companies will be asking you questions. If the police have anymore questions (assuming you already gave them a statement at the accident scene), they'll contact you if they need more information. <br>  <br>  Since you were a passenger, you won't be considered an independent witness. So, if your version of the accident is similar then the driver you were with, then that won't have any weight as determining fault.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	The other persons insurance company will be in contact usually by first light the next day to try to get to you before you have time to consult with an attorney or to think about what happened too long.. They will want to get a recorded statement from you… Decline this, tell them that there is not going to be any recorded statement at this time… This way you have refused the statement but allowed them to think you may do it at a later time… They will likely not take no for an answer and try to convince you that it’s just a simple procedure they have to do and won’t take too much of your time at all… <br>  Tell them again there will be no statement.. They will likely ask you if you’ve retained an attorney then, tell them No you have not , that you feel that this matter could be resolved without involving attorneys.<br>  This should please them and will save you money in fees later on at settlement…<br>  <br>  Now comes treatment for your injuries… Even though you may not feel much more than a headache or what appears to be other relatively minor ache and pain I urge you to seek out a chiropractor who will assess your condition and advise you as to what course of treatment he prescribes for your condition..<br>  It is possible that you have need for treatment prior to the accident but the accident brought your problem to the forefront with the impact, meaning your headache and or other pains…<br>  Start treatment with your Chiropractor and depending on your condition might need to be treated 3 days a week for a several weeks then 2 times a week for a several weeks then once a week until he releases you from immediate treatment… <br>  This is where the negotiation for settlement comes into play… Once you have a total medical bill to work with you now have a basis for negotiation…<br>  Even though your PIP insurance pays for your medical, you still use the total medical bill for negotiations…<br>  You should typically end up settling for 2 to 2.5 times your total medical bills for your pain and suffering.<br>  Don’t accept the measly amount they will try to offer you at first, tell them you were hoping to resolve this without attorneys, and that you will need a more reasonable offer, they will likely increase the offer immediately but only by 500 or 1000 bucks….decline again and they will likely tell you they have to talk it over with someone… <br>  Tell them (example I have 3000 in medical bills) so your offer is going to have to be reasonable compensation for that amount…they know what’s protocol, they are just doing their job by trying to give as little as possible..<br>  When you finally arrive at a mutual settlement amount, have them mail you all the paperwork…and when you receive this, take it to your bank to have your signiture notarized and send the paperwork back to them and a check for the agreed upon amount will follow in about 10 days… They usually expedite the check to you as they don’t want you to change your mind…<br>  <br>  This of course will save you 33-40% in attorney fees, and unless you have a complicated major injury case, you’ll do just as well as an attorney… we’re led to believe we’re not capable of settling these issues ourselves…that is just nonsense…<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I have applied these techniques about 6 times and I’ve always gotten nice settlements of  between 5-10 grand…<br>  Good Luck…

XLXncQu9aa	The correct way to stop at a stop sign is to slowly approach the sign.  You want to stop directly at the stop sign.  Don't stop before it or you will have points taken off with the possibility of failing the test, because it is considered running the stop sign.  Stop right at the sign.  Slow up and ease your way up to the stop sign.  Then make a complete stop.  Stop for 3 seconds, and turn your head both ways.  Do not pull off before you look both ways.  Give your instructor time to see that you have looked both ways.  Then proceed slowly.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I say B to be safe.|`|mycM2GgUaa	If there is a WIDE white line at the sign, stop before it.

AA10731159	There are literally thousands of vehicle built without AC, so that's not the answer.How have you checked the head gasket? If using indicator fluid(the only way to check it correctly), you may need to check it the entire time it is warming up-a bad head gasket/cracked head sometimes only shows up at a specific temperature. The cooling fans should kick on at about 230, and off at about 200.. How did you check the water pump? Visual inspection of the impeller should also include making sure it doesn't spin on the water pump shaft. I cannot begin to count the times that a thermostat was defective "out of the box, eliminate this by removing the thermostat altogether. <br>    As for the relationship between the fans and the compressor, the fans are required for the AC  condenser to do its job. Without proper airflow across the condenser, the head pressures get too high. Basically, the fans should be on anytime the compressor is ENGAGED, not necessarily when AC is only selected.|`|k55p1pKraa	Your car has two sensors that work your fan or fans, One of the sensors kicks the fan on when the temperature reaches a set temperature, that depends on the temperature degree of the thermostat . The other sensor comes on as soon as you turn the a/c compressor on.You also have two relays that work the same way as the sensors do.The a/c would not cause it to run hot just because it doesn't work unless the engine fan sensor is bad , one of the fan sensors most work to keep the car from running hot.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	well sounds like the fan relay is bad or the temp. sensor is bad <br>  i would check those out|`|3vt7GhVYaa	Also this could depend on when it is overheating.  If it does not overheat when at idle even in heavy traffic but does overheat when cruising at higher rpm it can be your lower radiator hose.  They normally have a spring in them to prevent them from sucking flat at higher rpm. <br>  <br>  A radiator cap with an improper pressure rating or just a bad one can also cause overheating.

u7nJQTOYaa	An induction kit (air coming in) won't make any difference in tailpipe sound, but some will make things louder in the cabin.  For exhaust sound (what folks on the street will hear), you'll need to think about your exhaust mods.  <br>  <br>  If money is no object, Dinan is the way to go.  BMW even covers their parts under the factory warranty.   A Dinan exhaust will run you around $1,000 and their cold air intake will run you about $500.  <br>  <br>  If you're on a budget and looking strictly for sound, any competent muffler shop could fab you a Flowmaster - even a glass pack - set up.  <br>  <br>  BMW does a pretty fair job with their stock systems - an intake and exhaust set up will really only net you 10 horsepower at max.  Further, your 1.8 liter simply doesn't have the displacement to benefit greatly from modifications.  <br>  <br>  As with all things BMW, quality will cost considerably more.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to get an intake kit (e.g.: K&N, etc.) and look into the online parts stores for an exhaust system (check out Bavairian Autosport, etc.)|`|EW5uBBc4aa	pipercross viper<br>  k&n 57i|`|UcXaXtrpaa	Models:<br>  <br>      * Europe<br>            o 1991-1994 316i - 1.6 L M40B18 I4, 102 hp (76 kW)<br>            o 1995-1999 316i - 1.6 L M43B16 I4, 102 hp (76 kW)<br>            o 1991-1999 318i - 1.8 L M40B18 I4, 115 hp (86 kW)<br>            o 1995-2000 318iS/ti - 1.9 L M44B19 I4, 138 hp (103 kW)<br>            o 1991-1995 320 - 2.0 L M50B20 I6, 150 hp (112 kW)<br>            o 1992-1997 M3 - 3.0 L S50B30 I6 286 hp<br>            o 1993-1997 323 - 2.4 L M50B24 I6 170 hp<br>            o 1994-1999 320 - 2.0 L M52B20 I6<br>            o 1994-1999 324 - 2.4 L M52B24 I6<br>            o 1991-1995 325 - 2.5 L M52B25 I6 192 hp<br>            o 1995-2000 328 - 2.8 L M52B28 I6 193 hp<br>            o 1995-2000 M3 - 3.2 L S50B32 I6 321 hp<br>      Wasnt taking the mick but this is the run down of bmw models i always thought the 316=1.6l just wanted you to right about your engine if your buying parts.<br>  Anyway if you have an na engine is best to go with a panel filter kn or apexi type placed in the stock airbox witha 3" air feed pipe.Better for your type of car than an induction kit .<br>  Also if you go for a decat on your exhaust and straight through pipe try to keep its size down no more than 3" has you need back pressue you can still get a good sound with this size exhaust and nice bhp.|`|tqexv9Sgaa	Go for the K&N type or ractive. Bear in mind the induction kit doesn't create the exhaust sound, the sound you get from the induction kit is the air being sucked into the engine. People often say that fitting an induction kit can damage your engine unless you fit an uprated ecu. This is because the engine is getting more air than usual which upsets the fuel/air mix, so if i were you i'd get a performance ecu or get the engine remapped after fitting the induction kit.

There is NO universal dexron fluid. If you have this service performed at the GM dealer and something goes wrong, THEY are resposible.  GET IT IN WRITING!!!!|`|a58uXYrYaa	That particular model car has what's called "voice recognition" software built into the vehicular computer.  To activate it (and by voice, check the transmission fluid), you need to stand at the front of your car and say loudly, "Car- activate voice recognition".  If the computer isn't malfunctioning, you will get a response back from your car.  It should be something to the effect of "Driver- authorization accepted".  Once that's done, you have fully engaged the voice recognition software.  Just talk normally to your car from here on out.  But, you need to make sure you speak "Car-" before any commands.  For example, "Car- check transmission fluid".  You'll get a response that says something like "Good to go", or "Needs changed".  Good luck- any questions, let me know.  marks.mike@yahoo.com
lObEjUh1aa	The most important thing is that you only accept a guaranteed form of payment (either a cashier's check or a money order).  Do not accept a personal check.  It is no problem for a person who can afford to buy your car to pay you in this way; if a buyer insists on a personal check, cut off negotiations with that person and find someone else (there is no reason a legitimate buyer would insist on a personal check for such a large purchase).<br>  <br>  As far as I know, you are not responsible for confirming that the buyer has insurance or even a driver's license.  If he/she is driving uninsured or unlicensed, the legal consequences are theirs alone; I do not believe you can be held liable.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you confirm the buyer's age -- anyone under the age of 18 cannot be legally held accountable for a contract (such as buying a car).  The best way to confirm a person's age -- you guessed it -- ask to see their driver's license.<br>  <br>  It's probably a good idea to get a pre-sale check done on the car -- just have a mechanic you trust give it a thorough inspection to determine if there are any obvious maintenance items.  Have him/her make a list of anything that needs fixing.  The best policy is to make any buyer aware of potential problems, as selling a car without divulging that kind of information may create some future liability.  If the car needs no repairs and everything is in good shape, you can tell buyers your mechanic has given it a clean bill of health, and maybe negotiate a little higher price for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hope this helps!

It shouldn't cause any further damage to run the truck before you fix the A/C, just dont turn it on. Chevys seem to have a common problem with the pressure sensor, tell your brother to check that first. Finally I would NOT pay more than about $2500 USD for the truck unless it has a new or rbuilt transmission.|`|a58uXYrYaa	What you need to do is take the air-conditioning compressor out of the vehicle.  Connect the thin metal pipe that comes up from the left side to the output of a can of R-134a refrigerant.  Pump the compressor with the refrigerant.  Make sure you plug the other thin metal pipe on the other side of the compressor.  Once you do that, set it aside and leave it for about 6 hours.  This allows the R-134a atoms to settle down and compose into their appropriate molecular structures to allow maximum efficiency.  Make sure you Gorilla glue any cracks you see in the compressor (if there are any).  Gorilla glue works great on a/c units.  Once 6 hours passed, hook the compressor back up, make sure you get the valves connected correctly.  You will then have to take the air-conditioning coil out and clean it.  Air-compressors work great for that.  Once you do that, unscrew the rightmost plug-cap on the radiator.  Make sure that there is no gunk in it, you may have to shine a laser or a mini-mag light down into it.  The radiator is indirectly hooked up to the air-conditioning unit by way of RF (radio frequency) on those particular model vehicles.  Once you do that, hook everything back up and you should be good to go.  Any questions, let me know.  marks.mike@yahoo.com

There are more than you think on some vehicles.|`|SrZf8Hgjaa	greese the door hinges|`|a58uXYrYaa	What you need to do is take your car door off.  Make sure that there aren't any animals or foreign predators lodged in between the door wall and the frame.  Those can cause squeaking.  Once that's taken care of, WD-40 the entire door.  Not just the hinges, but THE ENTIRE DOOR.  If a foreign predator found its way into the cubby of your door, the problem will come back.  The WD-40 deters any foreign predator or rodents.  Do that, and that should solve your problem.  Any questions, let me know.  marks.mike@yahoo.com|`|mSpogzXCaa	The most common noise is from the hinges.

We had lots of car factories in Coventry then but our all time favourite cars were manufactured in Browns Lane. I was close to tears when the remnants were recently sold to an  Indian company. Although  I never worked for a car company, when I  see some of the older Jaguar models around I am very proud that I was part of a great car era.|`|a58uXYrYaa	The fault code FF44 means that the windshield is about to crack.  The code comes from the vehicular computer where it has all kinds of sensors hooked up to it, and 3 of them go directly to the edges of the windshield.  The sensors detect glass stability by injecting atomic sized particles through the edges of the silicon dioxide (glass), which IS porous.  When the return value comes back to the sensor, they need to have the values of a solid piece of glass, therefore, if there is any instability in the glass, the timing will be off, tripping the sensor, causing the FF44 fault code.  I would have it checked out by a mechanic and tell them what I said, first.

e2McCGK3aa	yes and both the same thing,it will cause the car to leak or mix oil and water amongst other problems.<br>  early symptoms are loss of coolant, overheating (sometimes intermittent - ie. the temperature will rocket, but if you switch off and let it cool it will behave itself for a while before the problem reccurs).<br>  Final, and terminal, symptoms when the gasket really blows are that the temperature will go off the scale, you will trail a huge cloud of steam from the exhaust - the result of coolant actually entering the cylinders - and the oil will be converted to something resembling cold, milky coffee (actually an emulsion of oil and coolant).<br>  <br>  A head gasket is a gasket that sits between the engine block and cylinder head in an internal combustion engine. Its purpose is to seal the cylinders to ensure maximum compression and avoid leakage of coolant or engine oil into the cylinders; as such, it is the most critical sealing application in any engine, and as part of the combustion chamber, it shares the same strength requirements as other combustion chamber components|`|044IeGstaa	A failed head gasket, and a blown head gasket are the same. The area of gasket around the cylinder wall has deteriorated, and is no longer sealing the cylinder head to the block, in this area.<br>  <br>  1.Remove the oil dipstick, and see if it has a yellowish, or light brownish look to the oil on it. This means your coolant from the radiator, is getting into the engine. It has collected in the oil pan.<br>  See if the oil level is way overfull. (Width of your finger, or so, above the full line) <br>  2.With car cold, have someone remove the radiator cap. Not the plastic overflow bag cap, the radiator cap. You have to push down hard, and turn to the left. Not trying to be gender biased, but it takes some strength sometimes, to do this. Start the car up. Let the car warm up,(If it will, since it shuts off a lot) Takes about 3 minutes or so. <br>  Look at the coolant down in the radiator. Use a flashlight if you have to, and don't get your face too close. Are there bubbles? Not just a few little bubbles do to water/coolant flowing, but bubbles that are repetitive. If so, this is a sure sign of a blown head gasket.<br>  <br>  3.Was this car taken to a dealer to check out, or use the warranty? <br>  Whatever. I suggest you do us both a favor. See if this is a gender biased issue. You can take the car anywhere you want, no matter what the dealer, or car shop says. Have a male take it down, to a different place. See what diagnoses he gets. I have seen time, after time, after time, that mechanics try to wrangle more money out of the female gender, than male. It has been documented on 60 Minutes also. Messed up world, but learn to rise above it. If the male gets a completely different diagnoses, and it's cheaper, it's time to turn the place you went to, in.<br>  Contact the State Attorney Generals Office-Consumer Division, in your state. These people DON'T PLAY!<br>  <br>  NOT ALL mechanics are this way! I'm not, and scores of us are not!<br>  Perhaps these mechanics aren't either. A second opinion never hurts!<br>  (Especially when you see the cost of replacing a head gasket or two! Plus the other stuff that seems to go bad along with it!)|`|5IB8Fwdeaa	failed, blown, same thing. and yes it could cause hard starting. check the oil, it may have bunch of water in it, or the other way, oil in the radiator. might be blowing white smoke too|`|HWGSvN68aa	There really isn't a difference between failed and blown. Second, if you have a head gasket problem you should not be driving it at all. Your either going to be leaking coolant on the outside of the motor, or into the cylinders. If its leaking on the outside you could overheat your engine and cause a lot more problems than just a gasket. If it is leaking into the cylinders your going to have the overheating risk and the coolant will be getting into your oil. This will prevent proper lubrication and make your bearings in the motor fail and then you will end up with an engine rebuild or a whole new engine. $$$$$.  As far as your starting problem, yeah it could cause some issues cause your probably getting coolant in the cylinders and its coating the sparkplugs. My suggestion would be get it fixed asap cause it can only get worse from here.|`|XCueSDaNaa	Yes all that would for sure happen.  If your head gasket has failed or blown you will get little to no compression in your cylinders.  Meaning one of theses times your car is going to stop working.   If you dont fix it fast i promise the car will stop working.  A mechanic is going to charge an arm and a leg to change the gasket so beware....|`|Z2o8Xs4Iaa	there is no difference.either way , if that's what it is, you're pretty much saving for a new car.However, your car would not start if the head gasket was blown, cause that's an engine problem. It's probably a timing belt or the alternator.At least from my experience, but i'm not a mechanic, mind you.
b8cupXj7aa	Yes, some countries have different rules, but most are members of the  ICAO(International Civil Aviation Organization ) . allowing pilots of foreign based aircraft   to operate in foreign countries based on their credentials from their home/host country. |`|d3R6OZ3qaa	It depends on the country of your flag carrier. If you are flying for a US flag carrier than you are good to go. If you are flying for a foreign flag carrier than you must meet their requirements. Sometimes its as simple as walking into their aviation office and asking to get a certificate issued on the basis of your US certificate. I did some flying in Mexico and for any rating above commercial you have to retake the checkride. I have a friend who did it in Canada and it was the same thing. You can get a temporary to fly under a Canadian flag for 6 months, then you need to retake the checkride.|`|s3xFaZN5aa	Yes, as soon as you get your Private license you can fly international.

AA11823124	While Zeppelin's were the technological hit in the thirties, airplanes were faster and much more efficient at hauling passengers. The fatal accidents like the Hindenburg made them unpopular. <br>  Several start ups have designed new technology Zeppelins that use non explosive gasses and modern engine and computer designs to enhance their performance, but nothing has interested the venture capitalist yet.<br>  So far the biggest advance seems to be in the freight hauling business. They can carry large payloads like shipping containers to points inland from the ports without tying up the roads.<br>  There are some pretty interesting prototype designs out there on the web.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	I don't know where you got carry hundreds of people from.  The largest Zeppelin ever built, the Graf Zeppelin,  carried only 20 passengers, the Hindenberg carried only 13.  They were an extremely inefficient mode of transportation, extremely dangerous, and extremely unreliable.  Dangerous because their huge size made them structurally weak.  Unreliable because they could not be launched or recovered if any wind was present.  Hydrogen is blamed for their demise but both the US Navy's Akron and Macon used non-flammable helium but crashed because of structural damage in wind.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	They are way too slow for passenger transport service. They are way too small for cruising service like you see in the Caribbean. There are some small semi rigid airships in germany right now being used for sight seeing. they are not used for over nights just like a helicopter ride only quieter. The other problem is the huge cost of R&D and construction to start that kind of service again.|`|ZTMjXz1saa	They're just too slow.  People fly to get from point A to point B in the quickest and cheapest manner.  They don't care about one form of transportation being more luxurious than the other.  For passengers, flying is a waste of time.  They just want to get there.  I can see them coming back for the purpose of moving freight, but not passengers.|`|5f461c5a57b87f9398a78da9b50d79bbaa	Same reasons always given for this question . . . .<br>  <br>  In addition, they are NOT energy efficient for the distance traveled, they are NOT low polluters for the distance and time traveled, They would have to be HUGE to carry "hundreds of people".  They are NOT faster than the average passenger train, they are unbelievably SLOW, are not very maneuverable, You need even more helium to lift the same amount of load that a huge amount of flammable hydrogen could lift, you need a HUGE hangar to put them in AND not very people can fly one (or are interested in an airship rating).<br>  <br>  They are probably a bit faster than a cruise ship, but the ship can offer a lot more amenities at less cost per mile.   |`|98hu2yCUaa	The biggest flaw with the Zeppelin was the huge bubble of explosive gas sitting on top of the passenger area. This is the main reason they don't use them. it is true that their are more plane crashes than zeppelins but look at the ratio. if their were as many zeppelins as their were planes, I am sure their would have been an enormous amount of zeppelin crashes. you fly one of those things through a lightening storm or you create a shock somewhere and the whole thing is destroyed.|`|42qWUbVZaa	Because they are slooooooooowwwwwwww.  Perhaps not compared to ocean liners, but they aren't used for anything but cruises any more, and they have ballrooms, casinos, pianos, swimming pools, etc.<br>  Also, it takes massive buildings (hangars) to house airships.|`|s3xFaZN5aa	Ever hear of the Heindenburg<br>  <br>  [url=http://www.rewards1.com/index.php... [img]http://www.rewards1.com/common/imag...|`|dBGbQXjxaa	They are extremeley dangerous. Thats why almost noone uses them anymore. If you want luxury, just fly first class|`|8XCNDBxgaa	They are costly to maintain and not economical enough to operate.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Two words:  The Hindenburg. <br>  That crash essentially ended the era of the airship.  That,  and the R101 disaster, plus the US Navy's (bad) experiences with airships in the '30s.<br>  Yes, more folks have died in air crashes, but that's messing with one's statistics:  more folks have died, because airships haven't been used for air travel for over 70 years now.<br>  The biggest issues with them for passenger travel are speed and capacity.  Not sure where you got "hundreds" of passengers:  The Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg (the largest commercial airships ever built) only carried about 70-80 pax.  Compare this to a 747 which carries over 200 passengers at almost 10x the groundspeed.  Or a train like ICE/TUV which carry about 100 passengers at twice the groundspeed, and you'll see why they just aren't competitive.<br>  Where airships might have a future, for the reasons you suggest, is in the realm of freight:  airships can move freight directly from source to destination-without the need for transloading onto rail/truck.  |`|zlPAVkUBaa	The Hindenberg carried only 13 pax?<br>  <br>  Around 7:00 p.m. local time on 6 May, at an altitude of 650 feet (200 m), the Hindenburg with Captain Max Pruss at the helm approached the Lakehurst Naval Air Station and prepared to land. Twenty-five minutes later, the airship caught fire and quickly became completely engulfed in flames in only 37 seconds (since hydrogen gas is extremely flammable). The location of the initial fire, the source of ignition, and the initial source of fuel remain subjects of debate. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew on board, 13 passengers and 22 crew died. One member of the ground crew was also killed, making a total of 36 lives lost in the disaster.<br>  <br>  We wouldn't sell them helium at that particular time, that's why they were using hydrogen. The tickets were very expensive, and the trip took almost 3 days. Das ist nicht so gut!!!!

AA10164889	Any property owner may build an airstrip on his/her own property, subject to local ordinances.  Make sure your applicable local jurisdiction does not have an ordinance prohibiting it.  Few places do.  The problem you will have is with neighbors who are afraid "one o' them little airplanes will fall on my house."  These folks will try to get the county/city/township government to make you close it down.<br>  <br>  So be ready to do some community relations work and get to know the members of the local council.  A friend of mine who built one had this problem, and solved it by meeting with neighbors and council members, offering them airplane rides, and generally showing them he was not posing any menace to them.  A reasoned approach with background research is the best approach.<br>  <br>  In the US, the best way is just to go ahead and build it and start using it.  Make sure first that you are not violating local ordinances; then go ahead.  Depending on the lay of the land and how much traffic you have, you may not even alert your neighbors.  It's a good idea to make power-off approaches and turn away from neighbors' houses on takeoff, to minimize the attention you draw to yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  NOTE:  The answerer who calls himself "pilot and mathematician Spaniard" is completely wrong.  The overwhelming majority of airspace is not controlled, and radio communication is not required.  Most airfields are not controlled.  You are not responsible for unauthorized use of airspace or an airfield by others.|`|AA10065759	I think you would have to talk to the Canadian Government<br>  version of the Federal Aviation Authority(FAA) in <br>  the country of Canada. What are the regulations, rules<br>  and standards.<br>  <br>  Also, where the airstrip is is subject to the local area <br>  oridinaces of the town, county, district where it is <br>  located.<br>  <br>  Again, check with your Federal government and <br>  local government authorities on this matter.<br>  <br>  - - - -|`|d3R6OZ3qaa	YES! The only restriction that you need to verify is local zoning rules to ensure you can build the strip. However, if you are zoned for farming you most likely will be ok. There are no requirements for private airports to be certified by the gov't in anyway. In fact if I had a farm I'd just pave my long driveway and use that.|`|HE9wItSgaa	In the U.S., there are no federal regs that come into play (that I know of).  There could be some local ones, depending on what's around you - fir instance, if there are businesses that could have a concern about low flying airplanes in the landing pattern.<br>  <br>  If you want to give yourself the best chance, though, I'd see about getting it on the maps.  In the U.S., it's the FAA that approves that.  If you are on the sectional, it's a LOT harder for the public to close it down...<br>  <br>  There are lots of private airparks around...  One other thought, is to contact a few folks that have private strips, and see what there advice might be...<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|02sr7hNOaa	Generally speaking yes. However, if it is unlicensed you may have difficulties with insurance.|`|PK7dNtyZaa	yeah most likely if you have a farm you live in what the faa defines as a sparsly populated area. which means that class G (uncontrolled) airspace up to 1200ft agl! they cant tell you no! if you want it depicted on the sectional chart though you have to apply to noaa! you would be classified as a private airstrip of general aviation!|`|YNRUxH3naa	Yes, in the U.S. |`|AA10720479	My uncle made one with out any issues in the US. If it is your land I don't see why moving some dirt and maybe a few trees would be a problem, but I don't know Canada's laws. Just make sure it's long enough:) GOOD LUCK, and happy flying
EHF8yYwCaa	That depends on you & your home life.  How you deal with stress, loneliness, and whether or not you can find something you enjoy to pass the free time.  <br>  <br>  28 days isn't bad and is a pretty normal time period for OTR- I used to stay out for 3-4 months at once.  But I was single (and now I am team & my husband rides with me).  I have no kids.  Had all my stuff in storage.  Basically- nothing holding me back at the house, my truck WAS my home.  All the money I made went in the bank.  I have hobbies I can do on the road.  So I rarely got homesick.  <br>  <br>  If you have family at home, get a cell phone with a GOOD minutes plan, or a family plan where you can talk unlimited to your spouse or other loved ones for free.  Make sure you connect with them at LEAST once per day....communicate, see how their day was & share your day with them.  Keep in touch with friends.  Send postcards.  The more family obligations you have at home, the harder it usually is to be gone for long.  But keep in mind, if you're just getting into the industry, 1-2 safe years of driving makes you eligible for some good-paying local jobs.  Consider this "paying your dues" as it won't be permanent unless you want it to be.  <br>  <br>  If you are married, make sure your spouse understands that you are entering a stressful industry and need a positive, supporting person at home, "holding down the fort".  Many times, spouses who have no idea what trucking is like, make a habit of complaining endlessly to YOU the driver- about the kids, about the horrible day at the office, about the washing machine that's on the fritz.  This makes YOU stressed out and upset because you're away & can't do anything to help.  Before you go, make sure your spouse has a network of friends and family to rely on- someone who can help with the kids, a handyman to make repairs if needed, friends to can lean on when they have a bad day.  <br>  <br>  Find a simple hobby- there will be times you've got to sit.  You'll sometimes sit waiting on loads, waiting to pick up or deliver, or sit for your 34-hour reset.  Some drivers read books.  If you have a laptop you can watch movies or surf the Internet with a wi-fi or cell phone aircard.  Some drivers get into photography.  Some become "rockhounds"- you can find some pretty interesting rocks in different areas of the country with just a little looking.   Some get into arts & crafts- you'd be suprised at how many MALE drivers knit or crochet :).  Some get a dog (if the company allows) and spend down time going for walks with the dog.  Most truck stops have arcades, or you can put a TV in your truck with a video game system & play games.  There is a LOT of stuff to do if you think about it.  <br>  <br>  Life out here is often what you make of it....how you handle stress, how you let things affect you.  It gets to some people, others handle it very well.  All you can do is give it a try and see if it works for you.  Good luck!|`|AA10720479	My brother worked for USA trucking, and we only saw him every 6 weeks for 2 days at a time, but there are companies out there who have dedicated short runs. He now works for a company that has him home almost every night, and he is home every weekend(he does get paid by the mile). Do your research, you don't have to settle for the schedule you asking about. If your really rambunctious you can buy your own truck, and have your own hours, but it is very hard.|`|qICCYs66aa	Depends on the company u work for. If they keep u busy u wont have time to get homesick. If u are turning wheels u are making money which translates into happiness. I usually stay out 30/45 days unless im sitting alot then i go home for a few days.
AA10720479	Yes, completely normal. Be very careful, any kind of accident is always blamed on commercial trucks. At least 3 times over the last 6 years we've been blamed for accidents that were not our fault, and even went to court. Just 3 weeks ago, someone on a motorcycle rear ended my cousin(in law) while driving a garbage truck(family owned), Truck is still in impound and he was charged with something totally off the wall, and the accident was clearly not his fault.|`|LbEGDUX0aa	Completely normal. The first time you let your guard down is when something happens. Heading off into the unknown is enough to make anyone at least a little nervous. After a few months, you'll learn the ropes, know what to expect, and it won't be such a big deal. Rule #1 - don't hit anything and all the rest is a piece of cake. Pretty easy, but many drivers can't do that.|`|AA12162752	Of course you should be, you are driving, thats alot of weight. Caution is the way to go, be carefull and remember whatever training you had, those people were telling you the truth.

It takes more skill.|`|FUtkZ0dqaa	I have flown both there is no problem with either until you get to dual rotors|`|AA10720479	Helicopter, way harder to control.|`|QC94IKIxaa	Helicopters used to be more difficult to fly as they required constant alterations to the controls to keep them in the air; most fixed wing aircraft will "fly themselves" once you have the controls properly trimmed.<br>  The problem is that with a helicopter it is the rotors, the whirly thing on the top, that flys and the fuselage simply follows along. This creates all sorts of problems with vibration, inertia etc.<br>  With modern fly by wire technology, helos are now much easier to fly but still require more human monitoring of the system.
PfMSoBNEaa	From 70's to early 90's<br>  <br>  747-400 (Capt.) 200K to 300K<br>  <br>  Now, 80K to 150K<br>  <br>  First you apply, get a license, go to school, complete training, then you finally you get to fly. And at least every 2 months or so, get a medical and pass the "checks"<br>  <br>  It used to take 15+ years to become a captain but now, since most airlines/aircraft can be operated by 2 pilots it won't take that long but considering the fact that you'd be paid 1/4 of what captains used to earn up until the late 80's or early 90's; (inflation) it's up to you to decide whether or not it would be worth years of training and pretty much a life time of commitment. <br>  <br>  Note: security clearance required since pilots deal with classified information from the government. e.g. regards to possible terrorist activities and threats.|`|AA10720479	Assuming you mean airline pilot, they usually start out at 20k a year. It's not how many years your in the buisness, it's how much pilot in command time you have. The more hours and experiance the more money you make. Pay scales go up quickly. They usually start out at 20k 1st year, 2nd year30-40k, and the 3rd year on up any where from 60k-130k.This is if you stay with the same company. There are other commercial pilot jobs like flight instructors, corporate pilots ect. Pays for these job vary greatly.|`|w69EFhyoaa	The bigger the plane the more money you make.  Some Co-captains make the same or more than some Captains for example a 747 co-captain would make more than a DC-9 Captain.<br>  <br>  I knew some pilots with Northwest Airlines (Opps Delta ..now) who were Captains of DC-9s but had to take a promotion to be a Co-captain of a DC-10, when NWA flew DC-10s.<br>  <br>  I don't know for sure how much commercial pilots make but it's good money for the time spent, especially when you get to fly overseas routes.  I would guess a 747 Captain would be making around $175 - 200K a year.|`|rIHfjKBsaa	I got my bachelors in aviation, four year degree. With flight training it cost around $100,000, without federal, state, aid, etc. Then I was a flight instructor for 2 years making 25,000 a year, then I went to a regional airline and cleared a whole 18,000 dollars. Then I was furloughed from the airline and now fly as a charter pilot in corporate jets. I am a captain now and make around 40,000. Regional airline top out around 100,000 a year and it takes you many years to get there. Once you move on to a Major airline you start back down at 40,000 and work your way back up. Of course if your company goes out of business or you get furloughed you usually can't make a lateral move in pay scales. I.E. Regional captain making 80,000 a year gets furloughed, usually can't get the same pay. Probably would be going back down to 40,000.|`|oBbm2cHFaa	it takes 4 years because my nanas friend works at the air port and  after ur 4 years u get to drive the planes and get to go all over the world it is so worth IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Your age is not an obstacle at all.  In fact, the average age of private pilots is in the mid-forties—mainly because it takes years for people to make enough money to be able to fly.<br>  <br>  There's no upper age limit on private pilots.  If you get a license now, you can continue to fly for the rest of your life.  Airline pilots have a mandatory retirement age, and 44 is a bit late to start an airline career, but there are still private pilots who fly into their 90s.|`|ZTMjXz1saa	Of course it's not stupid.  If you want to learn to fly, then go do it.  Age has nothing to do with it.  As long as you think you are physically and mentally healthy enough, then you're good to go.  When I was a flight instructor, I had plenty of students who were much older than you.  I'd say the average age for my students, that were only learning for fun, was right around your age.  Good luck and have fun.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	It really is true that u are never too old to learn. As long as you have no bad medical history, you are able to gain a PPL (I guess this is wat u mean). an ATPL to become a commercial pilot will require alot more study but if you're willing, then go ahead!<br>  good luck!|`|MhelxLdFaa	Go for it and have fun flying! maybe one day you'll get there, just like i hope to!|`|AA11293043	As long as you don't have any medical conditions that may create problems (such as insulin-dependent diabetes), and have the money, there is nothing stopping you from getting your pilot licence.

Anyone passing the exams, medicals and course can get one. The private license is intended for recreational and hobby purposes.

ZasNwdXaaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  What is the cost of having it done at the dealership? My Chevy I get done for $14.95. Jiffy Lube can't beat that price. And in under an hour, takes a bit longer being a dealer, I get my oil changed.<br>  <br>  Now if I did it myself. 6 quarts, plus filter, plus time, getting dirty, having to get rid of the used oil. What did I really save? Nothing. But if you are paying over $30 for the oil change, then yes its cheaper to do yourself.<br>  <br>  Plus if you do it yourself, you really have no receipt record of having it done. Where a dealership you do have a receipt to prove later down the road that oil changes were being done. This can be handy for when its time to sell the car or for warranty issues.|`|mMPZuR7taa	If your warranty requires that you keep receipts for service from authorized outlets, you might want to use a cheap oil-change place like jiffy-lube. Dealership is not necessary for these, but if your dealership does not charge much, can't hurt to let them do it.<br>  <br>  If your warranty makes no mention of keeping required scheduled maintenance (I think they all do), then doing it your self is easy, fast and inexpensive.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	That's up to you. If you do it yourself just be sure to check the fluid levels on every thing and grease it if it has grease fittings.|`|FIgfJABxaa	In my opinion it's better to do it yourself, you'll save yourself a lot of money by doing so.|`|mA9hvZonaa	depends on which is cheaper|`|eOnHTloKaa	OK here is what i suggest. If the dealership itself is expensive you can go somewhere like jiffy lube or wall mart and the only reason i would suggest that because you will spend almost the same money but you will not get the same service. They are professionals and they know the exact measurements and everything and mainly because you get an overall inspection of wipers,lights, and  other liquid components, of the whole vehicle for the same price of changing the oil. So its worth it and plus taking of your car the right is worth it so it lasts you a long time. The oil in a car is like blood in humans. Very important. |`|vLddMaWPaa	If you know how, do it yourself.<br>  You are still 100% protected on your warranty.<br>  Dealers make a gillion per cent profit off of the naive car owners who go to the dealer and get sold a tranny flush, an intake valve spray cleaning, a finish sealant etc when they go get a simple oil change.|`|dvihikEFaa	If you know how to do it, do it.

The first reason why the car may be smoking is that the oil needs to be added.  You said you changed the oil, but I'm wondering how long ago you did.  I say that because if you changed your oil a long time ago, and you haven't checked to see if you are low on oil, then that could be a reason.  If you are low or have no oil in  your car, the light will alert you, and also your engine will begin to smoke.  That is because the oil lubricates the engine and various compartments.  Without it, the engine will burn up causing the smoke that you see.  Make sure you are not out of oil.  The second reason for this may be because you recently spilled oil on your engine or some kind of chemical.  That too can cause your car to smoke.  Check the oil again to see if you are running low.  If the problem does not cease take it to the shop and have experts diagnose the problem, but try these two methods first. |`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	where does it smoke from might give you a clue.

4zWmHGbFaa	Why is he trying to convince you of the safety?  Does he want you to get one, or ride as a passenger?  As with any bike, there is some element of risk due to the rider's skill level, the weather and road conditions, and the other vehicles on the road.  The most important thing for a rider is to recognize that risk, and make the right decisions to avoid incidents.|`|AA10720479	sport bikes are no less or more safer than cruisers, it's the person riding that makes a difference.

There are limits and he should stay within them. Those limits become more strict with a passenger.  Ie slower speeds and less lean. Not only because of the additional weight(no offense), and increased stoping distance. But a passenger adds a degree of distraction to the overall ride.<br>  <br>  As for as you driving play with a dirt bike first it is more forgiving.<br>  As for safety in bikes overall if you take a fall your kicking the bike and if you hit something your going over the forks.<br>  The rocket does have better maneuverability then say a cruiser(back to the driver thing) to say avoid a deer  etc.<br>  <br>  goodluck|`|LyauFqaaaa	worry about the other drivers on the road and try not to get the adrenaline rush to go over 140 mph on a straight away and you will be ok. btw obstacles laying in the street. in your car you can run over certain things make minor mistakes,hit potholes etc but do you think you can do that on a bike without any problems? also trust me road rash is not nice. not trying to scare you.motorcyle deaths have increased every year from 2,000 in 1997 to 5,000 in 2007.good luck just be aware of other drivers and don't try to show off and you will be fine.those numbers i put up are mostly from the reckless driving|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I would like to add to the first answer and say a bike is only as safe as the person operating it AND as safe as every other person on the road.

BvKfMIAVaa	Goodness no! You are never too old to become a pilot, or start training. As long as you can pass the medical exam (which is likened to the basic physical exam you took for sports), you can fly.<br>  <br>  Now as far as the actual learning goes, sometimes lessons are given in a "school" format with groups and such, but I would recommend a private instructor so you can learn at your own pace as well as gain better knowledge during ground instruction (which is where you learn the principles of flight).<br>  <br>  A good place to look for an instructor or flight school is in a phone book under the appropriate section (aviation or similar terms), or better yet go to a local airport. There is usually a main pilot shop or information center with someone behind the counter who can recommend an instructor/school.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA10720479	NO, it's not too late. You can go to almost any small airport, and they will have flight training. There are many flight schools out there as well. North American Institute of Aviation in Conway SC is the school my husband went to. He got everything there except the ATP rating(he can get that anytime). This school is the cheepest we found, and includes a dorm. Good luck and happy flying|`|ZTMjXz1saa	Of course not.  In fact, I'd say close to half of the airline pilots flying today are career changers and didn't start flying until their late 20's or early 30's (or 40's or 50s even).  It's never too late to start flying.|`|EDnT0y8caa	Everyone above is right. I didn't start flying until I was 25. I paid my own way as I worked several relatively low-paying jobs (and put absolutely every spare cent into flying) and earned my commercial and CFI licenses by the time I was 27, when I started instructing. I was hired by a regional airline at 29 and was upgraded to Captain by 31. At 35 I wasn't getting any interviews from the major airlines (only had a 2 year degree at the time) and was sick of the commuter airline "rat race", so I quit and went on to  do all sorts of much more fun, interesting flying (and generally better paid), ranging from fire fighting to bush flying in Alaska to Corporate flying. In a nutshell, it's not too late. You may never make it to the "majors" and make the "big bucks", but so what? Money isn't everything if you're not enjoying yourself. By the way, unless you go through the Army Warrant Officer program, you're on the cusp of being too old to get into military aviation, especially if you don't already have at least a Bachelors degree.

You're learning that your actions have consequences and you need to learn how to work through these challenges.  You need to deal with these situations, not run from them. <br>  <br>  I think you are over-reacting. Do you know how much your insurance is going up or are you just assuming the worst?  Have you discussed your insurance options with your agent or your parents?  Maybe you can reduce your coverage or raise your deductible to make up for the increased premium. <br>  <br>  Forget what the cops said. He isn't an expert in auto repairs. But I can see how a minor accident would cost $1000 easily.  The good news is you won't be paying for the repairs on the other drivers car. That is what insurance is for. But you will pay in the long run with higher rates.  <br>  <br>  If you feel in the long run that you really can't deal with the payments and the insurance you have only one option.

First of all, when a bumper does it's job, it absorbs the impact.  Beneath the surface, that can mean that it's broken.  I don't recall the name of the exact piece that breaks.  But if it is not fixed and someone else hits her, the bumper will NOT do it's job because now it's broken and nothing more than a decorative piece.  Depending on the speed involved, that could mean that her next accident could squish her car like an accordian.  <br>  <br>  Several years ago I had that happen to me. The mechanic actually took off the bumper and SHOWED me what broke and explained the difference between replacing the bumper and just touching up the paint.

And here I thought all I needed was touch up paint.<br>  <br>  It's unfortunate, but she was right to cover her own ***, especially if you were at fault.

But it sounds like you are probably young.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to try to sell it in a private sale... or see what a dealer might do for you with a trade.<br>  <br>  The cost of the damages can only be assessed by a mechanic, not a police officer.  When it happened to me, the damages were closer to $500.<br>  <br>  You need to call the insurance company and they will send you to an approved mechanic to assess the damages.<br>  <br>  (Or perhaps your mom will have to do it if it's in her name)

I know maney people who have dropped their bike(mostley from screwin around, wheeleys,ect), and it happend to them, some had engine damage, and some didn't.

Nasty stuff, methanol is (I work with it sometimes). <br>  Best thing I can tell you comes from personal experience: it WILL burn your valves. <br>  I think that the cost of cheap gas plus methanol would be more than the cost of premium.<br>  <br>  It's no big deal to run 92 octane. Premium only costs 20 cents a gallon more than low-grade. That's not even a buck a fill-up. There's a reason I run premium in all my bikes. They run well, costs less that way.|`|AA10720479	If you're looking for better performance try some av gas(aviation fuel). My husband worked at a small  airport and used av gas several times in his bike, it really made a difference. The only reason it's illegal to use in cars is because it has lead in it(and maybe for tax reasons). The only thing the lead hurts/clogs  is the catalytic converter, bikes don't have one. I know several race car drivers that use it. Most small airports have self serve pumps, but you should ask before you just take a jug in there and fill it up.|`|nDcSY8UQaa	don't waste your money, there's no benefits until you increase your compression and open up your carb jets to the size of pencil leads and run it straight, then you'll use 3 times as much fuel, and methanol aint cheap! |`|WRj1WJ7Yaa	Why? Methanol will NOT increase performance. It will increase your octane rating. But if your engine is designed for regular gas, increasing octane will do nothing for performance. Increasing octane makes it harder for you engine to combust the air/fuel mixture. This is beneficial in high compression motors or turbo/supercharged motors that have been tuned because you can run more timing or higher boost without the engine detonating (pinging). Engine detonation occurs when the air/fuel mixture ignites before the sparkplug fires. So if your stock sporster is not detonating, there would be no performance gain running methanol. But to answer, no it shouldn't hurt anything.|`|AA11275863	Methanol could well ruin gaskets, hoses, seals or any number of other things.
xfRyLbyKaa	If the factory key does not work than a dealership cannot make a key for you because they have no way of knowing what lock is now in the doors.  If you just do not have the door key then the dealership can make you a new key.  You will need to bring them the registration with VIN and an ID so they know you're not stealing it.  If the locks have really been changed then you will need to call a locksmith.  See if you bring the car to them if it will save you money.  They will make a key for you, but it costs quite a bit.  Don't know how much in your area, but about $100 here.  You could also just put new locks in yourself.

This is not always the shortest or most economical way to get from here to there. If I want to go see my mom in a town east of me, my GPS will direct me west in an opposite direction for about a mile to the freeway that will take me where I want to go. The freeway I want is about three miles south from my home and almost in a straight line.<br>  <br>  So what I do is check the destination address and route I want o take on the computer using either Google Earth or MSN Virtual Earth. This way, I can check for alternate routes, verify the names of streets close to my turn points and even identify reference points or landmarks along the way. If I am still not sure, even after all of this, I will call my destination and get specific guidance. BTW - Google is the most accurate in comparing longitude and latitude to GPS.<br>  <br>  Remember - the first rule of driving is to know the destination. The second is to know the route to get there.

FHUGeZ6daa	the R600 is basically a race bike for the street. It has a lot of state-of-the-art technology. It's in the Supersport class. The big 4 japanese manufacturers (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki Suzuki) are constantly battling to have the fastest and lightest bike in the 600cc and 1000cc categories. They totally redo these bikes every 2 years and are constantly adding new technologies to them to gain that edge. This is Suzuki's 600cc supersport bike. These bikes are designed for the racetrack as much as for the street (even though most of them aren't used that way)<br>  <br>  the 650F has a similar basic setup, but it's meant to be more versatile and practical as an everyday bike. It doesn't bother with state-of-the-art components, though it's still plenty fast. It's torquier down low than the race bikes, which makes is more practical on the street. The idea behind it is that it's a little ridiculous to be spending all this money for high tech racing technology of the supersport bikes when it is mostly useless on the street, so they made a bike with the same basic design (4 cylinder sportbike) minus the pricey cutting edge technology and parts, and gave it a slightly more comfortable riding position and tuned it for more low end power.|`|AA10720479	GSX600F is a bit heavier than the gsxr. I have heard that the katana(gsx600f) is much more comfortable than the gsxr. I have a katana and I think it's perfect for me. Yes it is the 600, but it has a jet kit to help with matching the power up with the gxsr. Does have the same power os a gsxr but that's only because of the jet kit, and other high performance upgrades. It is very fun, I would just stick with a katana, but everyone has their own opinion.

mX6aJSSYaa	You need the following. I know Because I've done it before. But remember you might need several of the following to do several cars at one time to generate more money.<br>  <br>  1. A hose with a spray nozzle.<br>  2. Car washing soap. <br>  3. Wax (If requested)<br>  4. Plenty Of towels to dry the car<br>  5. A Wet/Dry vacuum to clean the inside of the car<br>  6. Buckets<br>  7. Air fresheners (You can go to the dollar store and buy them in a pack for a dollar, then sell them for a $1, or $1.50, or $2 it's up to you).<br>  8.Large card board sign's<br>  9. People <----most important thing.<br>  <br>  Also to help the customer and keep everyone on the same page have a sign with the available with the type of offers you have available.<br>  <br>  EX------Car wash, $5<br>       ------Car wash, and wax, $10<br>       ------Car wash, wax, and vacuum, $15 <br>               Car fresheners, $1 each<br>  And what really attracts them to the $15 wash is when there is something free, Like a small bag of candy, or a soada for the wait.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this really helps.....|`|AA10789216	Just make sure you use car wash soap.  Dish soap will take the wax off.  A water blade (like a really soft squeegee) is helpful along with a chamois for drying.  |`|AA10720479	Sorry to hear about the loss. You will need to get several sponges, towels,a few gal of soap, maybe some Extension brushes. Everything you would need can be bought at walmart, just go to the car isle. Good luck, a very nice thing that your doing. I hope this helps:)|`|TA3twlYmaa	Don't forget a good location with lots of traffic, signs and people holding the signs attracting attention.

56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	I would not be surprised if you find that the problem is the fuel pump itself being bad. A clogged fuel filter does not suddenly happen in most cases.<br>   The fuel filter is either under the car in front of the fuel tank on the passenger side or else in the motor compartment under the w/washer bottle if it has one on the drivers side firewall. |`|AA10720479	I have a 98 eclipse turbo, book saye fuel filter is in between the fuel rail and pump iIN ENGINE COMPARTMENT. It says to remove battery, and air cleaner intake hose, so it must be under there. Make sure you unhook the battery.Book is for 1995-2000 eclipse, talon. I need to do the same thing. Good luck. I have a haynes manual and it tells you how to do every thing. Make sure the blow off valve is working ok. We put a new adjustable one on ,and it was doing what yours is. I adjusted it and it runs perfect now. iF YOUR PROBLEM IS THE FUEL PUMP IT IS LOCATED UNDER REAR SEAT-ON TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. yOU HAVE TO REMOVE REAR SEAT, AND PEEL BACK PROTECTIVE PLASTIC.|`|bdpcfkMWaa	Get the car back to the dealer and let them know what happened and if they can warranty the work.

4zWmHGbFaa	Go to www.msf-usa.org for information on classes in your area.  I would suggest the HD Rider's Edge course.  It's a little more intense than the state sponsored classes.  www.ridersedge.com.  Good Luck!|`|AA10720479	Yes you can learn to ride. Just go to your local bmv and get a motorcycle temps packet, study the books then go take a written test.If you pass you will be given a temporary permit, so you can ride. There are motorcycle education courses you can take but you must have a temp. permit. They usually furnish the bike for these classes. The class usually lasts around 3 days(8hrs a day). In Ohio the fee is $25.00 and that fee includes the road test. I'm 30 and love to ride, good luck:)|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Go to your local DMV.  Get the motorcycle handbook.  Read it all the way through.  Take the written test, so you can get your motorcycle learners' permit.<br>  <br>  Then, you will need a pair of boots that protect the ankle and won't snag on the shift lever which you work with your left foot.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to visit this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.msf-usa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msf-usa.org/</a><br>  Use the info there to sign up for a Motorcycle Safety Foundation riding course for beginners.  If you're phoning, ask them if they have something in your size, LOL.  They probably will -- most of the courses have several small motorcycles to choose from, and you're the right size for a Honda Rebel 250.<br>  <br>  After you've passed the course and gotten your motorcycle license, you'll probably want to get a cruiser-style motorcycle that's low to the ground.  The Honda Rebel 250 is a good choice, but you should try sitting on offerings from Yamaha and Suzuki and Kawasaki as well.  You might find you're able to handle a Kawasaki Vulcan 500.<br>  |`|4d9873cef453778f69dfc3f99dc77bb3aa	As others have stated, the MSF safety coruse is THE way to go. Depending on where you live, the class will cost from FREE-$200 Consists of 2 days of classroom training, and two days(6hrs each) of on-course riding training. It cost me $140, and it was money WELL SPENT.You will also get much lower insurance rates if you graduate the course.<br>  The teachers (or Rider Coaches) are cyclists that usually have been cycling for longer than you have been alive! Learn from them.<br>   If you find riding a motorcycle isnt for you, they will refund you. Helmets and cycles are provided for you for the course. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have no fear of your height and weight, There are many cycles that would fit you nicely, some cycles though, you would have to lower them to get a stable footing on the ground. |`|72ddVB2iaa	I was just talking to a girl behind the counter of our local dealer while I was buying some parts for my gixxer K3. She is in charge of the novice class of the dealer sponsored track days. She totally fits your description. She told me she rides a GSXR600. <br>  <br>  If she can ride and be an instructor, there is no reason at all that you couldn't learn. |`|AA10268382	In the usa, we have the MSF.org where you can take classes, if your not in usa, contact your local dealer and they will tell you where the nearest training is. they want you to do this so they can sell you a bike later,|`|fkHRwlAGaa	take the motorcycle safety foundation course and if you buy a bike just ride it around your neighborhood and learn how to ride the bike. get a ninja 250 and you will be happy. that's the way i did it but i started out on a ninja 500 and now i am riding a yamaha yzf r1.|`|FgfXV6oQaa	contact a local riding club and start chatting to them they are always very helpfull to a new female rider try www.r6central.com it is nation wide and has many good people who would teach you to ride safely<br>  
x7yKGaEDaa	This cord goes to the engine block heater.This block heater was a option on most newer cars and trucks.In the winter this block heater helps the engine start faster on cold winter first starts.You can leave it pluged in all night if you want.It has a built in thermostat that only gets so warm.Best of luck.|`|kpUXknSVaa	it is a plug so that you can keep your motor warm in the cold eather so your engine  will start better |`|AA10720479	That is an engine block heater, but they are usually just on diesels. That's kind of weird, maybe the truck came from Alaska where it's really cold all the time. The heater heats the oil, and some times the water too, for easier starts in cold weather.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Engine block heater.

b8cupXj7aa	<a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_831.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/fir...</a>|`|AA10720479	I got mine in less than a week, and didn't pay the extra money for expediting. I couldn't believe it.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	Try posting it in travel, you'd probably get more answers there. |`|AA11293043	Agreed re: travel, but I also have a couple of possibilities for you. Generally with issuing documents like this, it doesn't actually take that long to process the paperwork, but there's a long queue, hence the wait. The $120 fee buys you the privilege of jumping to the front of the line.<br>  <br>  Most likely, you'll just have to bite the bullet and pay the cash. That's the most sure-fire way. However, if you get in touch with the relevant authority and get on good terms with the staff, explain to them why you need the passport faster and so on, they may wish to help you simply out of kindness and a bit of flexibility in the rules. The 6-8 week mark is most likely the 'maximum' time and the delay may only be 2-3 weeks, however to be fair they do a standard turnaround for everybody. <br>  <br>  If you can tread the fine line of asking gently for help and reminding the relevant person rarely enough to actually become annoying, you may just get away with it. On the other hand, you may find yourself up against regulations which nobody is willing to stretch.<br>  <br>  Good luck, anyway!|`|FEJAfDctaa	According to the State Department, the average processing time for a routine (non-expedited) passport application is 3 weeks (from receipt of application). The average time for an expedited application is 2 weeks (door to door).<br>  <br>  An expedited application is an extra $60 added to the regular application fees, plus delivery charges (they recommend overnight). You can make an appointment at a regional passport agency if you need a passport urgently.|`|1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	If you want it fast, you're going to have to pay the fee. I think there may be exceptions if you need the passport for business purposes (you're a pilot, flight attendant, etc...) and can prove it. I don't know your situation, so that may not apply.<br>  <br>  |`|OdZysnvcaa	Staple a $20 bill to the application.  Just be sure they don't think it is your photo!!!  ;-)<br>  <br>  Eh, you'll probably need to pay the fee to be SURE you get it in time.  Otherwise you takes your chances!<br>  <br>  Good luck.
ce7e72f899042bd786c06db26cff1ca2aa	It's not normal. You should get it checked. It's a minor issue though.|`|AA10720479	Not normal, maybe week pedal spring,or low fluid.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	sounds like the return spring is weak.
uuelD3YRaa	Try the throw out bearing and the pilot bearing. I would also question the Transmission <br>  bearings on the front shaft and the bearings in the cluster. If you have a warranty on the reman trans. that is where to start.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|JqAWMyv1aa	Ditto on the clutch throw out bearing|`|AA10720479	Clutch Throw out bearing.

IIa4efh5aa	Check out Hemmings cCassic Cars sometime. There are plenty of restoration articles, and the magazine aims to build interest in the classic car hobby by running articles on under-appreciated autos that give enthusiasts on a budget a way to get involved.<br>  <br>  Maybe you like the looks of a Pontiac GTO but can't afford prices that look as though they belong to real estate. Maybe a 2- or 4-door Tempest or T37 would fit the bill -- maybe even a wagon, just to get you started. There is plenty of tired iron out thefre waiting for someone to restore their good looks.
