NQnOw4Qbaa	Texas has a mile marker 520, at least one but I am reasonably sure the one for I-20 is in Harrison County near the Louisiana state line.

They could grab a snack for when they are hungry, or a coffee or a drink.<br>  <br>  Third...It may also boost financially. More money would be coming in from whatever you make off of the cafe. <br>  <br>  Really is there any reason not to other then it's going to cost money to put it in? If you have the funds to do it! Go for it!

cd3ab9b51cb2e7dd4238d8bd3a6ed58caa	You can go with the typical exterminator if you want a name you can trust. Orkin or  Truley nolen, personally I rather go with someone that doesn't spray posion all over my house so my children and animals can get into.
