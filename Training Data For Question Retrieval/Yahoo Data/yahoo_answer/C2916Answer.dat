0UBhxlkNaa	Well I am not going to give you the answer but I will give you the formula.  When your doing these sort of problems you must first identify what each number stands for.  The mL is mass while the joules represents heat.  Therefore you should have been able to identify these sources of information.  What you probably didn't catch though is that the substance is water.  This gives you a huge array of data if you have data tables or a reference table.  Therefore if you use the specific heat constant then you are all set for this problem in the equation Q=mc delta T (heat = mass *specific heat constant for substance * change in temperature).  Note that specific heat changes for all substances.|`|krAlopvsaa	it is an energy balance.

It would not make sense to build a wind generator in a valley, or in places where the wind is broken up by hills and forest.  They generate more energy if they are high up (the wind is stronger high up) and away from any obstacles.  Ridgelines where it is otherwise flat are ideal places.  They are very tall and very heavy, so they need to be situated on firm, stable ground--it would be a bad idea to build one in the swamp.<br>  <br>  Also, wind turbines are fairly noisy, they probably need to be several hundred feet away from any houses.|`|SsPc6q1naa	Wind energy will work in lots of places, and it doesn't even need to be THAT windy.  We can put turbines on hilltops, plains, coastlines and more.  We have the space and man power to do it.  The small problem comes with harnessing the energy and making it efficient to transport it to the end user.  When electrical companies address this in an efficient manner, we will start to see more opportunity for wind.  Wind is a great, renewable, low-cost (in the long term) energy plan, but the overarching sentiment around wind is skeptical.  We need to change the way the general public feels about the possibility of wind, and the companies will follow.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	In Texas nature defeats U. the wind blows very good but when U need it at night it stops.|`|Nn4To7XKaa	Of course not.

You can't hook them up to the power grid because the environmentalists prohibit the construction of power lines.<br>  3. A wind farm requires huge amounts of land.<br>  4. They kill migrating birds and endangered species with the huge blades.<br>  5. The progressive intoxicated liberal, Ted Kennedy was sober enough to *NOT* want one in his backyard, so why should you want one built?<br>  6. No wind = no power.<br>  7. It is an unregulated source of energy.  Windmills could easily be taken off line (feather the prop) to manipulate the price of energy, just like Enron, Mirant, and Peter Cartwright's Calpine (and others) did a few years back.<br>  8.

They are noisy, and you wouldn't want to live within half a mile of one.  Also, they tend to kill birds.  Some people think they're ugly, they are very modern-looking and tend to be put in rural areas that otherwise appear very natural.  They definitely change the character of the landscape.<br>  <br>  To my mind, the controlling factor is the price to build vs. the amount of power that will be generated over the wind turbine's service life.  They cost about a million dollars to build, and they only last about 20 years.  I'm not sure how that compares to other means of power generation, it would be good to know.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	First off it changes weather patterns, it has been proven in England that wind farms actually alter wind current and weather patterns. When the internal turbines are engaged (to create electricity) it is extremely loud, it is only quiet when the internal turbine is disengaged and the props spin freely. Go to a wind farm and you`ll come out with a headache.  It is also a threat to wildlife.  Thousands of bats, not birds, have died from wind farms because they create a low pressure wake, this in turn essentially give the bats the bends or cassions disease, where Nitrogen comes out of solution in their blood and causes clots and seizes them up immediately.  Think of a scuba diver surfacing too quick.  bats can not detect the low pressure so they fly in and out of it, quite quickly, causing them to die.|`|GBAPvCheaa	Wind farms are evil.<br>  <br>  They kill bats in large number which causes mosquitoes to multiply which cause larger numbers of people to to get sick and die.<br>  <br>  And any project that a Texas Billionaire would get behind just has to have a dark side.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	It cost more than it is worth.U think U are saving oil for the future ,but I say go back to a good school and U will know that the recycling of CO2 into O2 and the C to oil.Nature has a complete recycling system working.|`|6BZ0uWLTaa	Many of the answers listed so far are good ones, but there are some common misconceptions included in the answers. So let's review; <br>  <br>  1. Cost - the cost to power generation ratio is higher for wind farms when considering maintenance and initial setup.<br>  <br>  2. Variability - wind studies are performed at proposed wind farms to determine the desirability of the site, but wind is unpredictable and variable at best.<br>  <br>  3. Ecological - While it is true that construction of windmills upsets natural habitats, the impact by wind power is significantly lower than conventional power generation types (including hydro which generally destroys thousands of acres). The insinuation that migrating or other birds are greatly affected by wind farms is an exaggeration. Research shows that more birds are killed by radio towers and skyscrapers than by modern windmills.<br>  <br>  4. Noise - There is a small amount of noise pollution generated by wind farms, which can be disturbing to residents in the vicinity.<br>  <br>  5. Visual - wind farms are often placed on scenic prairie vistas, hilltops and other natural areas. Some people complain about windmills cluttering up the skyline. Personally I'd rather see a windmill than a plume of coal smoke.<br>  <br>  6. Clean - It has been mentioned that production of the components of a windmill is not necessarily a non-polluting process. This is true of ANY construction or manufacturing process and so can be disregarded.<br>  <br>  7. Strobe - A windmill in the rising or setting sun can cast a shadow miles long and creating a strobe effect.<br>  <br>  Many of these issues could be resolved by construction of massive off-shore wind farms. The wind is more intense and frequent, and it is out of the way of human habitation. Disturbance to aquatic life would be equivalent to piers, docks, and other permanent fixtures.|`|TT7O1JXUaa	Currently the engineering is not efficient enough, basically wind turbines break down too often and require expensive engineers and parts to be fixed.

All our previous generations have done is set us up for disaster.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	Sorry but all U can do for mother Earth is nothing.What your hold group does is like trying to move all the sand on the beach into the ocean.U will fail and never know if what U did amounted to anything.|`|KzuF9D4maa	I'm glad to see someone thinking about this and asking this question, excellent!  There's a Native American saying that goes something like, "we do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children."<br>  <br>  Anyway here's a couple things I can think of pertaining to your question:<br>  <br>  Recycle and buy products made from recycled material:  Two reasons this is good.  One: less junk going into landfills, Two: In todays economy, it's cheaper then buying unrecycled!<br>  <br>  Don't drive if you don't have too: Can you get to work without driving yourself?  Then do it, one bus running is less pollutants going into the atmosphere then 30-40 people driving themselves to work.<br>  <br>  Go for energy efficiency: Energy Star appliances are good, the use less electricity then most other appliances, which is good for your electric bill, and (if a lot of people do it) results in less emissions from the utilities that produce the electricity we use.  Energy efficient light bulbs are good too, even though the cost more, they do last longer and will again cut how much energy you use in your home.  <br>  <br>  There's a lot of websites with tips like these, and some that if you give information about your home will tell you how you can save energy and in turn reduce how much pollutants are emitted by utilities.|`|Y9bsVgMIaa	There are many different ways to save mother Earth. You can take individual actions to lessen your family's and your own carbon footprint, you can talk to, inspire and make suggestions to your friends, and you can become 'politically' active by joining environmental and sustainability groups on the web and contributing to their letter writing campaigns to corporations and governments. For individual actions I would say:<br>  <br>  1: become vegan or vegetarian, or just cut down on red and favour white meat - meat production is devastating to the environment in so many ways - water pollution and overuse, greenhouse gases, soil erosion and desertification, deforestation and loss of biodiversity (extinction), unspeakable animal mistreatment.<br>  2: join a carshare program or share rides more often, commute using public transport, and take holidays closer to home. <br>  3: buy energy efficient appliances, and conserve energy at home. Get your home weatherised by a specialist and if you can afford it, get solar panels , or buy green electricity from your electricity provider. There are other small retrofits you can do to make your house more energy-efficient.<br>  4: inspire your child's school and workplace to launch green programs and to develop green policies - easy changes (that can save money), once made a habit.<br>  5: take part in local tree planting programs (or for that matter join any local groups with the same interest as you), or go off and plant your own seedlings and trees, and buy carbon offsets from reputable organisations  - there are many carbon calculators on the web. Try offset your historic records if you want a totally clean slate.<br>  6: buy less 'stuff' (voluntary simplicity), strive to be content with less, and buy local, organic foods from farmers markets and CSA's. Buy second-hand where feasible, freecycle and repair in favour of replacing.<br>  7. Yes, recycling is important but it is not the be all and end all of being green - we can all educate ourselves more about the reality we face.<br>  8. boycott companies with poor environmental track records - www.climatecounts.com (let them know about it too)- and likewise, support companies known to be eco-friendly/sustainable (patagonia, simple shoes, fsc-certified wood and furniture).<br>  9. invest ethically, in a green portfolio, helping green<br>   companies to grow, and making a statement using your money<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many books and websites that can give you advice -some better than others. You may like to prioritise a list according to what is in your budget, as well as your circumstances.<br>  Once you become 'greener', you will know you are doing your part. And believing in the importance and value of leading this lifestyle, and being vocal about it, will definitely have an affect down the line.<br>  Hope this helped.
XPbz5dOBaa	Difficult questions to answer but these 2 sites may help you.
L8zmQS8Jaa	Thanks charles for showing the parameters.  The question you have seems to aim at another question.  Is there enough room for enough wind turbines to accomplish what 24700 wind turbines could do?  To that I might add that one of the most promising places to put wind farms is off shore.  This land is populated by none but the fishes.  Cheers.|`|d871eb8f8d330deca1e5f50915813349aa	dead easy. depends on the height each turbine must have 100% Clarence around its base in Other words if it was to fall over it would be able to bounce its full length without hitting another object so now calculate height by length x2 & draw a circle around it at that distance then you need  24700 circles that big  provided there are no obstacles job done ....... i think!
