I don't even know what a normal pace is.      So, what I'm figuring out is, the vast majority of men are not divers.  At least, not the ones I've dated in recent months.

20090220100400AA893kF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	THe differences between homosexuality and every other sin...?	I was contemplating why homosexuality is such a huge issue compared with other sins, then I figured it out: Homosexuality is the only sin that has absolutely 0 impact on your life.      Fornication: say what you want, but there is something special about saving yourself for marriage. Whether you think this is positive or negative or not, you must admit, it has a huge impact on how you live your life.      Adultery: cheating on someone is bad.      Stealing, murdering, not honoring your parents, greed, etc. All speek for themselves.      Heck, even the OT laws made sense. Tribe size was important, so all the laws were to keep people fertile and healthy.         However, homosexuality is the only "sin" that does not negatively impact someone's life in the least. One can be a Homosexual Christian who goes to mass every week, saves himself for marriage (assuming he can get married), then has a loving, lifelong monogamous relationship. He is free to follow every single one of God's commandments.      So why is homosexuality so different? Well, when you read a little closer, you can see. Jesus fulfilled the OT laws, so you can reject those, but the ones in the New Testamtnt seem to be strange, too. Seems they are probably a mistranslation:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_a...    (Sorry about the Wikipedia reference, but this information is common knowledge for scholars, and it DOES sum it up rather nicely)         So, homosexuality is different from every other sin, and could be in the Bible as a mistranslation...Could it be that maybe it is not a sin after all?
20090220093459AAKUfMk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is It Possible To Be Tricked Into “Getting Saved?”?	There’s this guy who is a “psychological Illusionist” who uses his understanding of the human psyche to perform mind-tricks on people!      All of his videos are on YouTube and are fascinating.      In this particular clip, he puts out an ad in the paper saying that he challenges all non-believers to come to his meeting, where he has the “gift” of making people feel GOD and convert.      In short, they come, and DO convert!      They were all atheists and had no idea that they were being tricked – later, when they were told what had happened (that it was really emotional manipulation producing a psychosomatic response) they all recanted their conversion and left a little wiser than before.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKnO6MQCw...        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzn9rX7ra...             Is it not alarming how easy it is to have our minds taken over by mere manipulation to the point that we change our actual beliefs?      Can you think of any other scenarios in society, where people may be manipulated, psychologically?  Even to the point where it affects their beliefs or may cause them to believe in invisible or pretend things?      If you discovered that your beliefs were based on having been emotionally manipulated (since childhood) to the point of experiencing a psychosomatic “reality” which was, in fact, a grand illusion, would you, too, recant your belief?

Jesus did say a few profound things, but some of those he BORROWED from Plato, Aesop, Hebrew sayings, other religions (eg "The Golden Rule") etc      -------------------------      by the way, my personal favorite Jesus-saying/lesson, is the story of The Good Samaritan.

20090220094316AATF89p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think the USA can be brought down, destroyed just like the Roman Empire was?	After the Pax Romana, the Roman Empire started to decline. The reasons were political and economic, and they had problems with foreigners. After the guard killed Commudus, they sold power to the highest bidder....   A leader had to pay his army well to keep them happy so that they would fend off invasions. This led to high taxes and inflation. Borders were left open as Romans fought among themselves. Germanic tribes invaded, Persians took Roman lands, and Gaul tried to become independent.      Diocletian (elected by the army) and Constantine each set up strong one-man rule during their times as leader. They initiated many reforms:       Farmers had to stay on their farms; ones who left were hunted down.       Town officials had to collect taxes, and pay the difference between what the state wanted and what they collected.       Government workers had to keep their jobs for life, and their children had to do the same job.       The Roman Empire was split by Diocletian, into west and east.       The new capital was Constantinople because the east was richer than the west.   SEXUAL IMMORALITY:   sexual immorality the first sign of a disintegrating civilization?"    Any civilisation if it is going to function is going to need responsible citizens and sexual license in the name of "expression" and "freedom" show an unwillingness to have the needed self-control.       After all the sexual drives are pretty basic to people and quite powerful, and it takes genuine self-control and discipline to control such things.   Caligula practiced incest, homosexuality, multiple sex partners as did many in Roman Culture.   HOW IS THE USA NOT HEADING DOWN THE SAME PATH?

Is this really possible? It seems too good to be true, that right like that someone can see and hear again.

We can be kind to those who are kind to us and to those we like.Should we be kind to the unkind,the ungrateful and to strangers we don't know & to the despicable.Christ did say what is the virtue or merit of being kind just to those who are kind to you.Most people will not be kind to those they don't respect and who they don't feel deserve their kindness.If a person is just kind to his own so to speak what is spiritual about that?Not to mislead anyone i believe kindness is like the sun { not judgmental}that shines on the good & the bad,the wise & the foolish.the believer and the unbeliever.

20090220100713AACh5mH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	About 'The New Heaven'?	If you're going to give some ignorant anti-Christian answer, just click the back button now please...      I was just laying around today thinking about random stuff...I thought of the 2012 theory that the world is going to end. Well...I don't believe it whatsoever, because I believe God won't give warning such as an epidemic theory like that...      Anyway. That got me to thinking about the end of the world, which got me to thinking about hearing about the end earlier in '08 at a church group. I don't exactly remember what it was about, but apparently AFTER the end of the reign of Satan on Earth (Not like today, the tribulation and such), if my memory serves right God will renew the world? I cannot for the life of me remember. But all I know is hearing about 'The New Heaven'.      If someone could give me an explanation on it, that would be fantastic. If you're not too aware of anything like that, or if I'm just a complete idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about and imagines going to church groups...hey, any info would be great really.      I really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

Hate is from the Satan.  A person can not worship both Love and Hate.  No one can serve two masters. Racism, Male Chauvenism, and Homophobia are malicious forms of hate.  These are the works of Satan. So Christians thinking that God is homophobic is wrong! God is merciful, loving, forgiving, and tolerant of mankind. Therefore God can not hate homosexuals. Or is this wrong?

St. Aquinas argues that there are things in the world in motion (this simply means that things are changing) and that whatever is in motion must have been put in motion by another thing in motion ( Newton's first law of motion). Aquinas holds that, "whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another," and that, "this cannot go on to infinity, because then there would be no first mover." Hence St. Thomas argues that in order to eliminate the infinite chain of motions, there must be a first mover and source of all motion, God, Yahweh, Allah etc...

20090220104034AAK1N85	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If a Woman Had Someone Medically Attached To Her, Would God Desire For Her To  Stay Hooked Up?	This Woman, rescued from a car-crash was found to be unconscious.      She was found to have the unique blood type necessary to sustain a dying man who was also at the same hospital she was brought to.  He only had an hour to live without her support.      So, while she slept, “they” hooked the man up to her (tubes, monitors, pumps).      The woman awoke and was informed that her body had to be used in an emergency situation to save this man’s life.  But the good news was that she only had to be hooked up to him for nine months.      - Besides, she was to be married in six months, anyway.      If they disconnected the man from her, he would surely die.      How would God judge her if she then refused to offer her body any longer to be used by this man.  She was sorry he would have to die, but she simply did not want to do it and further, felt no obligation to support him with her body for nine months.      In fact, she felt “raped” by the whole ordeal.      What right does a human have to another human’s body?      Especially if the invasive human is unwelcome?      Similarly, in the case of a woman who gets pregnant due to rape; what right does the rapist’s sperm have to invade the woman’s egg?      Indeed, what right does the resulting child have to have total control over the woman’s body for the next nine months – and consequently for the rest of the woman’s life?      Especially when the child is wholly unwanted by the woman who will gladly endure whatever pains, psychologically and physically she must, in order to put that rape and the resultant child behind her as quickly as possible.      Q: If the hypothetical woman DID find herself unwillingly hooked-up to a man, should the woman (who was not complicit in the action) be forced legally, to give him use of her very body for nine months?

20090220105928AAQgVlM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Since Jesus Himself said you dont' have to follow His apostles, why do Catholics Preach that?	Mark 9:38-41 (King James Version)      38And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.       39   But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.          There it goes, the scripture that authorizes any Protestant denomination that speaks Good of Jesus. So why do Catholics preach that you have to follow them if this person didn't follow the apostles and Jesus was ok with it?

20090220110721AAYTP62	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could any Muslims or Arab scholars/speakers take a look at this please? Thanks?	I found this online and would like to know if it is accurate? It addresses the definition of 'Islam':         "An Arabic word only has one root.  The root word for Islam is “al-Silm,” which means “submission” or “surrender.”  There is no controversy about this among Islamic scholars. al-Silm (submission) does not mean the same thing as al-Salaam (peace), otherwise they would be the same word. "      So 'Islam' does not mean' peace'?      Please could someone clarify? Thank you :)

20090220110846AAHV86W	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Sallam how would u answer this person....?	Sallam    i was reading a blog about signs of judgment day and came to this part       ****Ladies will bear Men like Appearance. (One example - WE SEE TODAY MUSLIM WOMEN WEARING JEANS AND TROUSERS AND TOPS….(and a so called hijab, which makes no sense…the whole point of hijab is to avoid grabbing the attention of the men…..so by wearing tight jeans and tops and wearing the hijab is killing the purpose of the hijab…..its actually making fun of the hijab……so those sisters fear Allah and follow his orders if you want to succeed…The prophet (pbuh) said – the women who wear tight clothes or clothes which reveal her body will never come anywhere near the smell of junnah (paradise) let alone be in it……so my sisters in Islam…..it is vital that you wear hijab and cover up according to Islam…because if you don’t there is a heavily price to pay!).…..EVEN MORE SHOCKING THE JEANS WORN BY MUSLIM WOMEN ARE EVEN TIGHTER THAN MEN’S JEANS……MAY ALLAH GUIDE THEM TO THE RIGHT PATH AMEEN! Do NOT take the orders of ALLAH lightly!******      and i had to comment on the part where it says **** prophet (pbuh) said – the women who wear tight clothes or clothes which reveal her body will never come anywhere near the smell of junnah (paradise) let alone be in it…****      this was my comment *****      Sallam   i was just read this very interesting blog of urs..nice... and just wanted to leave a comment...about the hijab part...u are right about wearing tight jeans and sluty tops but i dont think we have the right to judge them...i allhamdulillah wear a proper hijab and a full dress but when i see my sisters out side not wearing a hijab or wearing it with tight jeans...i dont say "oh look there's no chance shes going to junnah wearing that" even tho it says they wont...i just dont think that just because someone doest dress the proper way they wont go to junnah...only our lord know who will enter junnah and who will go to hell weather she's a whore or weather she wears a full hijab....i think we should all look into the persons heart not the out side, there are so many men with beards who pray 5 times and women who wear full hijab and pray 5 times ..they make then self look so pure and saint from the out side but when u look deeper into their hearts all u see is dirt and no love flowing through it what so ever here's a story i heard "In teaching kindness, the Prophet once mentioned a story about a prostitute. Driven by thirst, she came to a well to drink water. There she saw a dog by the well that was dying of thirst. Since there was no bucket to pull water with, she climbed down into the well and satisfied her thirst. Then, remember the dog, she soaked a cloth with water, climbed back up and squeezed the water into the mouth of the dog. The Prophet (PBUM) said that for this small act of kindness to an animal, God forgave her sins and granted her paradise."   thank you for taking you time to read my comment   take care Khuda Hafiz*******       AND this was their reply *****Wasslam....i know of that story you stated.... A women who wears tight jeans and then hijab...do you think she fears Allah?????..NO!...the one who FEARS ALLAH does not disobey him so openly!. One more thing...ALLAH and his prophet never lie......and yes true its all about your intension.....but 1 thing is a fact....a women who wears tight jeans and tops....and then wears hijab has only 1 intension...FASHION AND TO GRAB THE ATTENTION OF MEN..HARRAM!!..IT CAN NEVER BE TO PROTECT HER MODESTY OR TO PLEASE ALLAH AND HIS PROPHET....you cannot go Against Allah’s order and say your intentions are clean and therefore what your doing is ok…………any sane person would understand that.   and yes true...there are people out there who seem to be good muslims from the out side but really they are full with dirt......LETS NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM BUT WORRY ABOUT OVERSELF....they will not be with us in our graves....we shall be alone....we will be acountable for our own deeds NOT THERE'S. nobody has the right to judge anybody..BUT we have the right to state the fact and aviod the evil and call to good...this is fard upon all muslims!.   Allah's and the holy prophet's orders should not be taken lightly....and Allah forgives who he wants and punishes who he wants.   Jarzakallah for reading my comment also.   Allah-hafiz*******      all i was trying to say it that just cuz ur not covered properly doesnt mean ur going to burn in hell at least thats what i think....and i also wanted to say is that we shouldnt judge our sisters who dont cover and say oh they dont fear their lord...or the only reason they are dressed like that is to grab men's attention...i say this cuz i was ones a teen who wore tight jeans and tops with a hijab....but not cuz i didnt fear Allah or cuz i wanted to get the attention BUT cuz i didnt have much knowledge about islam...i was never taught....i had to teach myself      HOW WOULD UR REPLY BE TO HIS COMMENT   THANK YOU ^_^

20090220110312AAxolDq	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How is it racist to want Sen. Burris to step down?	I'm aware he is the only black senator, but he is also just another Chicago Politician, and just as corrupt and dirty as every other one.  There is no honesty in Illinois Politics, and Burris has shown that he is just as corrupt as the others.   Instead of making this a black man issue, why can't the focus be more on the fact that Chicago politics are a shining example of corruption, greed, dishonesty, and abuse of power?     I feel that if Burris should keep his job just because he is black, the Blago should be re-instated also, else it become a racism issue of removing a white man, and allowing a black man to stay under the same guidelines.

Do what the hell you want.  I have no prob with gay ppl.  This is just a question, i mean do straight women have a problem with gay ppl or something?  they seem to get gross out by it or something?  i dont get grossed out.  i mean its funny how you hear guys talkin bout its not gross about girls makin out and vice versa for women, they dont like guys making out.        Bottom line is why is everyone so damn sterotype?  im thinkin bout working at a gay bar doing barback, which its a bushboy basically.  ppl think im weird applyin for a job there, who cares!  some ppl just need to mind their own buissness.  Im 25, i can do what i want. Im not doin anything evil, bad.  Im just livin life like you should.  Out of my famliy me and my gay brother are ones who dont judge.  Rest of them do.
20090220110529AAykrLo	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What do you make of this situation?	Well its kinda complicated but I'm not sure what to think of this. My best friend has stopped talking to me because of a misunderstanding that happened. He thinks I was trying to make like an advance on him or something (I wasn't). So now he thinks I've been a fake friend and only was his friend because I "like" him. We had a rare friendship that is hard to find in guys. We were always there for each other and did stuff for each other. It was a friendship that you'd typically find with girls i guess. Like for example we could like share the same bed and give massages. It wasn't gay or anything like that we were just best friends and were comfortable enough with each other to do that. So now he thinks I had alterior motives I guess. But I don't understand why. If I wanted to I could turn it around on him if I wanted but I know its not like that. So what do you make of it. Why could he possibly throw away such a close friendship over something retarted?

I'm not so excited. Let's be honest it's sold in the game section for a reason. However, some people believe it's simply your subconscious mind moving the indicator and that it is in fact all psychological, and others think it's very much real and something more.      I've read a lot about Ouija boards, but what do you think game or real?    If it really is controlled by your mind, then you yourself could be the one leading you into the mental state that so many people claim to be the act of an evil spirit. On the other hand, would you even want to take the risk of allowing yourself and friends being put into danger?      My view on this is undecided, and whether it is spiritual or scientific, I still won't want to mess with one. What do you think?

20090220113512AAwtmTA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I think I want to find a guy?	Well, Im Bisexual. Or I guess Bi-Curious since I have never actually been with a guy. I really feel more like what I have heard called Pansexual. I like people, I dont care about gender. Anyway. I have really been interested in trying to find a guy. But I am a little unsure of how to go about it. I live in Boston, so its not like there arent any good looking gay/bi guy around, its just I dont know what to do. The thing is, I dont want to get into a relationship where one of us is dominant and the other the proverbial *****. The idea of overpowering or being overpowered is not a sexual turn on for me. Truth is I am more interested in trying to find a relationship that is similar to hanging out with one of my straight male friends (you know just a general close friendship), but with a physical relationship and a deeper emotional relationship. My main problem is that I dont have any gay/bi friends, so I dont really know the dynamics of Gay/Bi relationships. anyway, thats what im looking for. Anyone have any suggestions on how to find it?

Why are protestants comfortable with the idea that Jesus did a half-arsed job at being the messiah, so he must come back with the kingdom he supposedly never instituted?      Jesus promised the gates of hades would never prevail against his church, and the Catholic church is the only body that fits the criteria of the kingdom that was foretold in the OT, and the only body that was born at the time of Christ.      Why are you comfortable with believing our messiah is an incompetent?  Why do you not praise the Lord for keeping his promise as you behold the 2000+ year old miracle that is among us today?

Some black people may agree or disagree. Some black individuals who comment on something,have an opinion, or whatever say that all black people have ghetto in them.What do you think about that? Well with me I say that is untrue because any race(white,hispanic,etc) can be ghetto,just because an individual is black does not mean they are or should be since there's  blacks who don't fall in that category too.This was also brought up in my school today which became an argument with these 2 girls and 1 girl just because that 1 girl said that they were acting way too ghetto towards the teacher and the other girls got mad and said "Well, you black too,every black person got ghetto in them!"Also, why does being black have to do anything with being "ghetto" including that the other person didn't even bring up the word black.Opinions ladies and gentlemen, and Yahoo users please, do not argue with each other:-) Keep it clean.   NOTE BEFORE TYPING:Please take notice when I say "some" meaning not all before talking mess that is not necessary and what not to make yourself look like a fool.Thank you.

I am in 8th grade and I live in the South in a large black area. About 80% of the people at my school are black. However, in the Gifted Program, most of the people are white. There are even more Asians than black people. Even so, there are far more white people and Asians than black people. All the black people are in the regular and lower class. They are also the ones to always get sent to the office. Whenever I'm in an elective class that has people in my gifted class as well as black people from regular class, the black people are always getting written up, disrespecting the teacher, using foul language, etc. Most of the white people get into no trouble. Of course, some of them do. But rarely.      Again, I'm Asian and some of my greatest friends are black and I do not mean to be racist.      I just want to know why it is like this. Thank you.

20090220125819AA25SAn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	When will the adults who were born in the Arab/Asian World integrate with the values of the Western World?	I feel there is a big gap between me and my parents when it comes to open discussion. I am born in Canada, however, my parents are born in India, and Tanzania. It seems like in the south asian culture and the arab cultures, there seems to be no respect of the ideas Western cultures bring. For example: You should be able to date whomever you want, marry whomever you want, hang out with the friends you like, and to make your own choices. With my parents, on certain topics, they limit me from expressing my true feelings and I believe every person in the world regardless of age, gender, race, religion, colour, disability, sexual orientation, income, etc. YOU should have the right to revail your true feelings. It seems like with my parents, they want me to not date until I am done college, like what the hell? Plus, they want me to date somebody within my religion, what the hell as well? This is what I am talking about? If anyone wants to have open discussion about this matter, please let me know? Have a good day!

20090220123438AAlIhKL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Organ donation in Islam and other religions?	Dear Friends: What is the rule or stance in Islam protaning to the donations of organs or of the body after death?   My friend and I were wondering if their are rules or laws in Islam (or in any other religion) protainning to the matter of donating your body for use, either by a living person in need or for the cause of science, and medical studies (to further help humanity or life, not for the cause of death).  On one hand I think it is allowed because you are providing a charitable act by donating yourself.  It is a charitable act and it could save a life, or even more with the saving it brings.   On the other hand each and every body that contained a soul shall be resurrected on the day of judgement and that might be saying to God that God cannot resurrect me.  But yet God knows your intentions.  Also what shall become of the sins committed by that person who received the organ transplant.  Will they be appointed to the organ that did it, or the soul that impowered it?   Sorry for the length of the question but if you have any ideas, thoughts or answers please try and answer.  With best wishes...   Salaam, Shalom, May Peace Be Upon You And The Mercy And Blessings Of ALLAH (GOD)!      Also, please try and give references, sources, etc

20090220122502AAAdI0g	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should i think about it or do it?	I've been in an 8 year off-and-on relationship with a certain guy. The OFFs were common in the first 2 years bc i was underaged and he was scared he could go to jail. Plus, i told him i was 20 when i met him, but i was really 16. Anyway, after i turned 18 we had two major OFFs but this was because his family never liked me. If it wasnt for them, i would've married him a long time ago. They're small town kind of people and bc of the mother their very judgemental (the dad is the opposite, like my bf). Im a very shy and dont open to individuals quick, so therefore they think i'm hiding something or they just dont like that. I have to admit i havent met them regularly but when i did i tried my hardest to make conversation and be sociable. anyway i'm bisexual and i asked him if it would be ok for me to be "sexually active with other women ONLY". He said it was cool, but then the family found out i had ONLY kissed a girl from their town and they freaked and really hated me after that. I'm more mature now and i would never do that again, nor do i want to. He is enough for me. But i just wish his family would accept me. I tried hanging out with them recently but they didnt really care too much for me. Then he wants me to marry him and he doesnt really stand up for me when his family says something mean about me, so i dont know if i want to spend the rest of my life with a man who wont give me my place. But i do care for him. Based on what i wrote, should i marry him or find someone else?

What should we do about the individuals that find no comfort in rehab, but continue to roam the streets with needles hanging from their arms?       In Oslo, we have a serious heroin problem, where junkies are lining up around the block hoping to start the methadon-treatment. However, the line is much longer than the social services systems can handle. So what do we do? Too many junkies, not enough nurses.      It should be pointed out that the seriousness of this problem shouldnt be trivialised, as certain areas downtown are litterally clogged up with buyers and sellers of heroin and other assorted treats. There are sections of our main street where you cannot get through without litterally rubbing shoulders with people who openly buy and sell hard drugs. The Police claim they are short on resources, the local authorities are clueless.      What to do?

20090220132505AA2wAXk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does society depend on religion to keep people in order?	no doubt MORALITY is what keeps society running as smoothly as it is, no police force in world could prevent a million dissenters from going crazy and destroying a city or town if they so chose to, and most cities have more than a million people these days. the question is, where does morality come from? is it innate? if so, religion is not necessary, at least in a social harmony sense, because the majority of people would do good anyway. but if morality and a sense of ethics is LEARNED, something acquired through teachings like religion and history, then is it not imperitive to the stability of the entire world to keep the structures that dispense such information to a willing public (children) going as long as possible? you might call it brainwashing, but look at the bigger picture. even on yahoo answers atheists, who are generally free thinkers and unlikely to accept the established way just because it is the established way, argue more and create more conflicts than their pious counterparts. read the forums for a few days if you don't believe me! atheists rile people up. and while on a small scale this can prove encouraging and even revolutionary, on a large scale it equates to a large group of people unable to get along. so from a social harmony point of view, does religion keep people in check? and is that really such a bad thing?
20090203030657AAefXIl	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is he so annoyed?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

I'm just wondering if any atheist or non-christian moms celebrate holidays like easter with their kids. My husband is a lax catholic (doesn't go to church or anything, but apparently believes in god... though I think he is actually atheist and just doesn't want to admit it because christianity is a big part of his mexican culture.) and I am atheist. I was raised by my mom who was a catholic nun before I was born and we always celebrated easter, christmas and all that from a religious standpoint and from the normal commerical american one (santa claus, presents, easter bunny, etc.)       Anyway, I don't want my daughter to miss out on the fun commercial aspects. She's only 17 months but for christmas she got presents and all that, we just never did anything religious. I'm wondering though if we make a tradition of giving an easter basket will she start to wonder when she is 2 or 3 what easter is for besides getting stuff? I guess its really the same with christmas.      of course when she is older I will explain the story behind these holidays as I do feel it is important to be educated on the prominant religions of the world and our culture. Just as I feel its important to be educated on greek and roman mythology, etc. I don't believe in it, but there are still lessons to be learned and all religions are very important when studying world history.      Basically, if you don't believe in the christian god, what do you and your kids do on easter and xmas?? (BtW - What brought this question up was I was in big lots and saw all kinds of cool easter stuff besides candy and I really wanted to make her an easter basket!!)

Okay what you do in your own home is your business, but when you expect other people to aid you in it that is where i draw the line.

And should a parent be allowed to abuse their children?  If it is no ones business then why do police and social workers intervene and arrest parents that are suspected of child neglect and abuse?

It's not because they are concerned about me, it's just that they don't want to catch what I have.  You should see the look on their faces when I use their phone or keyboard. I tell them that the do make Lysol wipes if they are that mortified. Besides, aren't they more likely to get sick riding the bus or train than using a pen I just wrote with. It's not like I'm going around sneezing in people's faces. Am I out of line on this one?

20090220131156AAO55gB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about abortion?	Recently there was a guest speaker who came into our school and taught that abortion was morally wrong. She said that the main reason a baby should be saved is because the moment they are concieved they have a soul and are scientifically human. Regardless of age, money, or rape I think that abortion is wrong because it is killing, that unborn child is equal to any other human and taking a life is wrong. What are your views?

Today at school, I was standing up and this guy came up from behind me and spanked me. (I am also a guy.) He id it again 5 minutes later, but this time he grabbed my butt. I looked in the student hand book and that can be considered as sexual harassment. I don't want to let a teacher know because he is a jock and is friends with the majority of the 7th grade. I don't want to get ganged up on. At my school, the preps and jocks get away with almost anything. It pissed me off because people already have marked me off as gay, in the 1st grade to be precise, and someone started a rumor that I asked him to spank me but he refused, but did later on.

On public transport I've noticed that people of different ethnicities smell differently.  Some smell more of body odor & sweating (genes?).  Others smell like certain food (culture?).  Certain ethnicities of men consistently have bad breath (gross!).  Why is this?        I bet I smell too, what do young Caucasian women who eat a lot of raw vegetables smell like?  I'm curious.

The internet says "está chovendo", but a colleague of mine who speaks Portuguese at home, but wasn't educated in the language, always says "está chover". Her parents come from Mozambique (originally from Portugal) and she says that how they speak. Is their speech odd, or is the "er, -ar" optional with this tense?

My employer (which shall remain nameless) recently hired a deaf person to meet some bullshit requirement established by the Americans with Disabilities Act. It's horrible having to work with her. Yes, she is pleasant enough and she's got a pretty nice body, but, my god, when the woman opens that mouth of hers: cover your ears. It constantly sounds like she's gargling a mixture of saliva and tar as she attempts to form words; it literally makes me want to vomit.      I don't want to sacrifice losing my job over this, but I would like to politely let her know that she is not welcome. Other co-workers have gone so far as to call it a "minor distraction" and it "takes some getting used to", so I am not the only one. Our boss is really pleased with her work so far, so I can't call her out for incompetence. Any suggestions on how I can drop a not-so-subtle hint?

The 12 eagles had revealed to Romulus a mystical number representing the lifetime of Rome, and some early Romans hypothesized that each eagle represented 10 years. The Roman calendar is counted from the founding of Rome, 1 AUC (ab urbe condita) being 753 BCE. Thus 120 AUC is 634 BCE.

She looks at me with that evil smile she makes and then takes an apple and scratches the wall with its stem. i was so frieken scared i ran back to my room. i wasnt sure if it was real, or if it was just my eyes. i just locked the doors and went to sleep. the next morning i walked to the wall where the witch had been and there was a brownish black mark about 1 or 2 in on the wall where she had been. that mark was not there before       my question: might i have seen a demon/something or was it just my imagination- because i was about 9 or 10 years old. the imagination thing is probable.

I feel there is a big gap between me and my parents when it comes to open discussion.  I am born in Canada, however, my parents are born in India, and Tanzania.

For example: You should be able to date whomever you want, marry whomever you want, hang out with the friends you like, and to make your own choices. With my parents, on certain topics, they limit me from expressing my true feelings and I believe every person in the world regardless of age, gender, race, religion, colour, disability, sexual orientation, income, etc. YOU should have the right to revail your true feelings.

This is what I am talking about? If anyone wants to have open discussion about this matter, please let me know? Have a good day!

I share the bathroom with 6 other girls. At the apartment, I can get my own room and bathroom for 500 a month. The walls are super thick and the environment is very calm.

February 2008, New York) A 50-year-old man was bird hunting in Upstate New York with his buddies and his faithful canine companion. They stopped for a smoke, and his dog found a deer leg bone!      The man tried to take the bone away, but like any right thinking dog, the animal would not relinquish its treasure. He stayed just out of reach. Frustrated with this blatant show of disobedience, the man grabbed his loaded shotgun by the muzzle and began wielding it like a club. Each time he swung it, the dog dodged.      Suddenly the "club" struck the ground and fired, shooting the man in the abdomen. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he died from his injuries. He did remain conscious long enough to confirm this account to police; otherwise, his poor friends might now be under suspicion!      At least he didn't hit the dog.

I think even most average looking men have a chance to be intimate friends/bf's of the most beautiful women in the world, because that's what happened to me.      I'm an average (not bad) looking guy, but have a pretty interesting personality. I thought this girl would be really conceited, because she was extremely beautiful; but was nevertheless the queen of my heart. We're going out now :)

20090220125224AAAKVu6	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	If you were to design a Barbie, what would she look like? (society)?	I have seen all these topics and stuff about Barbie. If you've never seen Barbie, you really need to get out more often (and look at:  http://www.barbie.com/  )      The opinions are many, her breasts are too big... her neck is too long... if she's so popular, why do you need to buy her friends? Much Barbie-bashing to be had, but here's the real question for all of you.      If you were to design a Barbie doll in the here and now, Mattel came to you to design the next incarnation of the world-famous doll, and you know you would jump at the chance of that! Don't lie and say you would not do it because that's not true. What would she look like? What color hair? What would be her bodily dimensions? Would she be made out of plastic, rubber or some other materials? How long will you make her legs?      Not asking you to design the whole Barbie Universe, just Barbie herself for the new generation.      So... what you got?

I always get rude comments or people will ask me strange quetions that is for the soul purpose of making fun of me. Today though the abuse got physical. I was at my locker and I was getting my thing together to go home and this girl I barley even know. (I don't even talk to her so she should have no reason to do this to me and I think it was really uncalled for.) She kicked me three times.   I was in my locker and she says," Get outta my way." (I wasn't really in her way all that much.) Then she kicked me.   I said, " Don't kick me. You have no reason to do that."   She goes," I ain't kicking you. Don't get smart with me!" And she kicked me again.   "Stop kicking me!"   And she kicked me again. I left before she could kick me a fourth time which she tried to. It was in the lower part of my leg (almost on my foot) and it wasn't hard but it was still a kick. I've never done anything to her and she has no reason to hate me. She's just another person who doesn't like me because of how I dress.    To me it doesn't matter how light she kicked me a kick is still a kick.   How uncalled for do you think this is? She has no reason to do this. I don't talk to her the only real thing I know about her is her name.

It used to be in style in the late 90s to for homosexuals to wear really clunky metal ball necklaces with rainbow rings and other similar sorts of jewelry items, and t shirts with crazy slogans, but absolutely no one does that anymore where I live. Maybe it's not seen as fashionable? Are there new items women are using to communicate to other lesbians or bisexuals that they are available now days?         I'm not a very feminine person with my interests and clothing choices, but I am attractive, and I have very long hair...should I cut it off...are women thinking that I am straight? Are there lesbian haircuts? Do I need something more androgynous? Also, all my friends are unfortunately guys, because I am such a tomboy. Should I go places without them? Are women thinking they can't approach me if I enter somewhere with a guy friend?

I think it's so dumb and stereotypical. And the worst part is when people say s.h.i.t. about them they complain when their the ones giving us the reason to say b.s. .

For the first time in my life I've really fallen hard for someone, he's 25 and I'm 19 and is one the funniest, nicest and best looking people I have ever met. I'm normally very guarded around people but I go all soppy and weak around him. What's worse is that I'm going to be spending the whole weekend with him and a group of mates.      He's straight (as far as I'm aware) that's the problem. I've heard a couple pf people saying that he can even be homophobic but I don't believe them as he's admitted he has a couple of gay friends that he and his straight friends drink wth from time to time.      I have straight mannerisms (don't really know why) and he has no idea that I'm gay. It's just horrible because I have so much trouble opening up to people and the first person I fall for I have to distance myself from because I'm bound to get hurt.      Has anybody else been in this situation and if you have how did you get through it?

Well I'm a 16year old pre-op male-to-female transsexualand since October I've been going to an LGBT youth group which so far until last week I've been the only ever male-to-female transsexual who's ever been, they've only ever dealt with female-to-males so...and even seeing them is rare so...but the group is brill and I've made tonnes of friends, due to the fact that I fancy girls I tend not to hang with the guys that much but still, everyone is great there except for the odd  one or two who in any group you get, lol.    Anyway, we've been doing a play lately to abolish LGBT stereotyping and also to advertise the group a bit more and we only really focused on LGBs for a while which i didn't mind but Val due to me being transsexual said maybe we should mention discrimination that transsexuals often face, fortunately other than family(which we kinda cover in the LGB scenes anyway) has only been my real problem and I'm out to my entire school and they're fine but we came up with a scene where my character is...

If Muhammad was brought up in a western society and was conditioned by western culture would you think Easterners accept him regardless of the culture gap between him and them?      Keep in mind many "Easterner" Muslims have a habit of labeling things which they do not like in western societies as "too western and not unislamic".      Also would you think there would be strong objection to arranged marriages among you (western) Muslims because the culture which Prophet Muhammad was in was the total opposite to it?

I really don't see the problem because I always need rides here and there but she can only drive me to so many places. I'm sick of not being able to join extracurricular activities or get a job because I know I wouldn't be able to get a ride. She keeps saying I can get my license when I'm 18 but seriously I can't wait that long! Yesterday I just got my permit and she's still acting all pissy ever since the wait at the RMV. She keeps telling me she's not paying for my road lessons, pay for my insurance, or even get me a car. Most of the Asians at my school didn't their license until the end of their senior year.

This question is for true Christians only; not those of you who do not practice truthful, upright, pure Bible standards ---- so there won't be any confusion or lies to anyone or this forum, and no false or offensive reporting -- BY LAW.      I mean the Bible, God's word, is very clear on such matters as homosexuality, adultery, and other acts of beastly fornication including thievery and extortion, yet so many wicked souls -- wicked humans --- continue to try and justify their immoral, sickening behavior with one lame excuse after the next. Are these ones blinded by the devil, or they are part of "the vast majority of the world's population" that will lose their lives come Armageddon?      I find that each day is harder and harder to live because of so much filthy immorality and wickedness in the world. Some days it's just so overwhelming that I just have to shut the world out and read my Bible studies, and/or just pray for endurance.      1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11:      What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet that is what some of YOU were.      True Christians only, please weigh in. Thank you so much.

I hate my brothers saying dame that woman is nice looking as I agree with them, I hate that I share this desease he created to build his worship up with my male friends, as they say nice body to the woman and I agree with them. I hate Gods lack of creativity....and it is so unlike God. The way he creates things and the beauty of him. How every hand on a person is different and how everything he creates is different...but yet I share a woman's Beauty and I am sure love on a woman with my fellow brethren. As I have thought lots of times I loved a woman. How do you put away your desire for a woman, it is my natural desire.....and I hate myself.

20090220132455AAO5Wy6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you understand the Bible's prophecy of Christ's invisible presence?	As recorded at Luke 21:24, Jesus said: “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations [“the times of the Gentiles,” King James Version] are fulfilled.” Jerusalem had been the capital city of the Jewish nation—the seat of rulership of the line of kings from the house of King David. (Psalm 48:1,?2) However, these kings were unique among national leaders. They sat on “Jehovah’s throne” as representatives of God himself. (1?Chronicles 29:23) Jerusalem was thus a symbol of Jehovah’s rulership.      How and when, though, did God’s rulership begin to be “trampled on by the nations”? This happened in 607?B.C.E. when Jerusalem was conquered by the Babylonians. “Jehovah’s throne” became vacant, and the line of kings who descended from David was interrupted. (2?Kings 25:1-26) Would this ‘trampling’ go on forever? No, for the prophecy of Ezekiel said regarding Jerusalem’s last king, Zedekiah: “Remove the turban, and lift off the crown. .?.?. It will certainly become no one’s until he comes who has the legal right, and I must give it to him.” (Ezekiel 21:26,?27) The one who has “the legal right” to the Davidic crown is Christ Jesus. (Luke 1:32,?33) So the ‘trampling’ would end when Jesus became King.      When would that grand event occur? Jesus showed that the Gentiles would rule for a fixed period of time. The account in Daniel chapter?4 holds the key to knowing how long that period would last. It relates a prophetic dream experienced by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He saw an immense tree that was chopped down. Its stump could not grow because it was banded with iron and copper. An angel declared: “Let seven times pass over it.”—Daniel 4:10-16.      In the Bible, trees are sometimes used to represent rulership. (Ezekiel 17:22-24; 31:2-5) So the chopping down of the symbolic tree represents how God’s rulership, as expressed through the kings at Jerusalem, would be interrupted. However, the vision served notice that this ‘trampling of Jerusalem’ would be temporary—a period of “seven times.” How long a period is that?      Revelation 12:6, 14 indicates that three and a half times equal “a thousand two hundred and sixty days.” “Seven times” would therefore last twice as long, or 2,520 days. But the Gentile nations did not stop ‘trampling’ on God’s rulership a mere 2,520 days after Jerusalem’s fall. Evidently, then, this prophecy covers a much longer period of time. On the basis of Numbers?14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6, which speak of “a day for a year,” the “seven times” would cover 2,520 years.      The 2,520 years began in October?607?B.C.E., when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians and the Davidic king was taken off his throne. The period ended in October?1914. At that time, “the appointed times of the nations” ended, and Jesus Christ was installed as God’s heavenly King.—Psalm 2:1-6; Daniel 7:13,?14.      Just as Jesus predicted, his “presence” as heavenly King has been marked by dramatic world developments—war, famine, earthquakes, pestilences. (Matthew 24:3-8; Luke 21:11) Such developments bear powerful testimony to the fact that 1914 indeed marked the birth of God’s heavenly Kingdom and the beginning of “the last days” of this present wicked system of things.—2?Timothy 3:1-5.         From October?607?B.C.E. to October?1?B.C.E. is 606 years. Since there is no zero year, from October?1?B.C.E. to October?1914?C.E. is 1,914 years. By adding 606 years and 1,914 years, we get 2,520 years.   ( bt 1914)               Does this make sense?....Any questions, Please feel free to email me.         How does your religion view this prophecy?  Do they acknowledge it or ignore it?
