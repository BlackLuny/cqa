tOCESHLYaa	Norton Internet Security 2009 is very good. I doubt if you could get better protection by adding a bunch of different security programs. Plus you would be using a lot of ram with all those programs. Kaspersky Internet Security is also good. You can get help on their forums. You won't find free support. The reason being that many users get infected all the time it would cost them a ton of money to help user clean out their computers.  These user don't get infected because the security software fails they get infected because they have very unsafe internet habits. View porn, Download illegal music, those kind of things.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Securing Windows operating systems from Internet assault & increasing predation, is not a single application, or even a suite.   It's layers of protection, user habits, system configuration, real time protection; and most important, threat landscape awareness (because the internet is so fluid and dynamic, it changes almost hourly).    Stand alone suites (CareOne, McAfee, or Norton) give users 'feel good' security, and lull them into complacency, which often has very bad results.     Look through some of the suggested freeware here,   http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/securi...  study up, and pick some of the frontline, real-time defenses.  Create a restore point after each install, then run the system to verify that application's 'friendliness' with your system before adding other applications.  Make selections based on your skill level & system's other configurations...an application you can't work with is of little use.  Generally speaking: as a system's convenience, interactiveness, flexibility & complexity increase: security decreases.    Sorry, but using Windows requires you to become a security expert, it's that simple.  Something they omit telling you when you buy this system...|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.|`|PvPZYFr5aa	A tech support friend advised me to stay away from the security suites and use layered protection instead.

FyshZrbmaa	what operating system are you running?  Usually with Windows you can move your cursor over the available wireless networks and you should see the connection type.  "Wireless G" "Wireless N" etc.    Just Fyi you will need both a wireless N router and adapter.  You can only go as fast as the slowest connection.  So for example if your router is N but the adapter is wireless g you can only go up to 54mbps...

Try the HP P1006 printer.  $90-180 depending if its on sale and the toner is relatively good.  Stay away from Brother as you have to buy a new drum every so often which costs at least $100  Try staples, best buy, or newegg.com    Good luck!

In this case, they say, your data is not lost, just temporarily inaccessible; it will be accessible again once the firmware update is installed.     Here is an email I received from them on this subject about a week ago:    A firmware issue has been identified that affects a small  number of  Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 hard drive models  which may result in data  becoming inaccessible after a power-off/on operation.  The affected  products are Barracuda 7200.11, Barracuda ES.2 SATA, and DiamondMax 22.  Based on the low risk as determined by an analysis of actual field return  data, Seagate believes that the affected drives can be used as is.  However, as part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, Seagate is  offering a free firmware upgrade.    Please follow this link  (http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/se...  to enter the Knowledge Base article(s) detailing the steps to update your  drive.

I run a live cd of an operating system. I would choose ubuntu 8.10.    Click here  http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download    click the link that is closest to you.    after you have the live cd you need to burn it to cd/Dvd    click here for a free good program to burn the .iso (Ubuntu 8.10) file.  http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=5    after you install the program click "actions" and go down to "burn Image"    then browse for your new download of the .iso file (Ubuntu 8.10)  Note: in the burning setting do not set to max. The slower the burn the better (with an .iso file)    Now when that is done plug in your hard drive and turn off your computer. Note: make sure your computer will boot from cd/dvd drive.    you will be prompted to "try Ubuntu without any changes to your system". This is totaly safe This will NOT wipe your computer. After boot up ubuntu will try to mount your harddrive. if it tells you unable to mount. then you need to go to open a terminal. do this by going to applications > assesories > terminal      copy paste this  sudo mkdir /mnt/external  then press enter    then copy paste this  sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt/external -o force    there should be an error that comes up. After the error unplug the hard drive and replug the hard drive back in.     Then bam mounted hard drive.    if that worked right click on the hard drive and go to unmount. Then when you boot back into your normal operating system it will mount.    If that did not work please email me c4bjenglacious@yahoo.com    in your email add this information.     In terminal (applications > assesories > terminal) type this  fdisk -l    and paste me the output.     Good luck

Reinstall flashplayer 9 or 10 whichever your OS uses. check your device manager((start=control panel=system device manager/hardware tab and make sure you dont have any ? marks or ! marks. If you do you need to reinstall your drivers.     NOW LONG ANSWER TO clean up the junk in your trunk and other things from a few of my other answers.    Could be a number of things. It could be throttling. A process used by an Internet service(not necessarily just your ISP it could be a browser like yahoo or any site that receives high traffic) that involves pulling back or rationing their bandwidth so that there servers won't crash due to the intense load. It could also be your browser. I have noticed that Mozilla Firefox loads pages a heck of a lot faster than IE7 or opera. It could be your puter's cache is FULL. Use a disk cleaner such as Ccleaner or Sweepi to delete all your old temp files and junk that clutters up your puter. It could be that you have other programs using bandwidth and yahoo isn't being seen as high priority. Unfortunately this Internet thingy isn't a science. If you don't have an Internet security system like avg installed it could be a virus, malware, adware, spyware, or worms. Most DNS clients cache the results of name resolution requests. This speeds up name resolution if multiple lookups are done to the same address, such as is common when browsing the web. Sometimes a bad DNS entry will be cached and you will need to either flush the DNS cache to get rid of it( ipconfig /flushdns in your run command ), or wait up to 24 hours for it to be dropped from the cache automatically. You may need to defragment your drives.    This will take a while. First and foremost lets make sure you don't have any junk in your trunk.Download and install then run Ccleaner(virus, adware, spyware free) as well as Sweepi(leave all boxes checked during the install). After that is out of the way run your Disk Defragmenter. That may have helped a bit. Next up are your start-up programs. When you install a program some of them automatically start when you boot. For some programs like AVG or other security programs then that's fine. For some others like Game-spy or some non-essential program that you can start manually if necessary you don't want those taking up ram unnecessarily. Open sweepi and run the Boot Manager(similar to the run command of msconfig but with a friendlier user interface). Delete the programs you don't want to start-up during boot-up. This will only remove them from the start-up not your computer. Most of the programs will also carry suggestions with them to advise you on the importance of the programs. After you deleted the junk programs then restart your computer. That may have helped a lot. If after all this your computer is still slowwww then you can tweak it a bit more. Click on start-settings-control panel--system--performance than virtual memory. YOu should let windows handle it. If you want to use more of the HDD as ram than click on the specify my own settings. The rule is about 12% of your HDD to be used as a page file or virtual memory. Some go a bit higher but never lower unless you are positive you have enough ram which i assume you don't If you want to max out your ram and not worry about virtual memory then install 3.5GIGs of the fastest ram that Crucial.com suggests. Then again there is always the virus, malware, adware, spyware, trojan or worm possibilitiy. You chould always keep your antivirus software running. Don't go overboard on security. Some products like mcafee(um spelling may not be even close) or norton and avg do not work in concert and can corrupt your system.

GPUe13xXaa	You need a new screen.  For the money you're better off buying a new monitor and getting a wireless mouse and keyboard and use it as a desktop type of computer.  If you use your laptop in more than one place a screen replacement could cost as much as $600.  The extended warranties help when things like happen.      Maybe you have one?  Or maybe its still under the manufacturer's warranty?
8y4Uwo9Haa	I have never heard about them. If you are having problem choosing a web hosting to use, I suggest you do the following:       1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.       2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a X sucks search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.       3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.    You can start with Serverpronto, Webfaction, Justhost and Fatcow.

BhNP2P8Xaa	What version of Red Hat are your trying to install? The installation of Red Hat should detect your hardware and install on a SATA drive without any special work on your part.    I might suggest that you try one of the really free version of Linux instead of Red Hat. Red Hat is a "commercial" version of Linux that includes paid support. Free versions tend to be a little more cutting edge than Red Hat, a distribution for which stability is a big selling point.    Look at Ubuntu (or it's other family, Kubuntu or Xubuntu), Fedora (which is the "free" version of Red Hat) or CentOS (another "free" version of Red Hat), OpenSUSE, or one of a few dozen others.    All of these will install on a SATA system without any interference from the user.

Im a member of the Windows Outreach Team and just wanted to stop by and drop a little knowledge for your question. Im not tech support, but I think I can point you in the right direction.    First, you definitely need some RAM installed in that computer. Make sure you research the motherboard thats included in the system your girlfriends father gave you to make sure you get the correct type of RAM.    Also, depending on how old the system is, you might want to check out the additional specs that are needed to run the Windows 7 Beta. You can find them here: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    Also, remember that Windows 7 is in Beta testing and isnt intended to be used as a primary OS after the Beta testing session ends on Aug. 1, 2009, so youll want to have install discs for another Windows OS on hand so you can continue using the computer.     If you come across anything else, feel free to reach out. Good luck!    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|OueLHhNgaa	Hello Friend, the computer will not work without the Ram go get the PC a Ram and see what will happen.|`|QmlkMK9Naa	You need RAM for a computer to work >_>|`|5zhgaiW9aa	Should have built in ram no matter what of some sort... but if not your kinda screwed,go to best buy whith comp info they have some REALLY cheap ram like 10 dollar for 212mb i believe it will work =) and if your comp cant find monitor test and make sure if there is a graphics card that its in fully and power is hooked to back of it
AA11558033	if it's a laptop.... it's better to take it to a professional cos u have to take it apart. if not then just get an external DVD drive. they run around $50-$100 i think|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Turn off the laptop.  Take out the battery.  Turn it over.  Look at the DVD drive.  there are 2 screws holding it to the laptop - near the back (away from the tray).  Take them out - just them, not any other screw.    Gently pull the DVD drive out of the laptop, about half an inch.  It should come free pretty easily.  Push it back in.  Turn the laptop back over, replace the battery and power it up and try the drive.  (Sometimes the contacts get dirty - unplugging and replugging it cleans them.)    If not, power down again (never work on the laptop with power on) and remove the battery.  Remove the drive all the way this time.  What you want is a "slim line" DVD drive.  http://microcenter.com/single_product_re... or http://www.directron.com/ds8a2sa01.html will fit.  (The only part that's not generic is the part you see when it's closed - the only way to get one that looks exactly like yours is to buy a replacement from Phillips.)    Or you can bring it to a local repair shop (NOT a big box store - most of their "technicians" know less about computers than you do) and get an estimate.    But it really is something you can do yourself.  the  most difficult part is putting the drive (old or new) in - you have to be a little gentle and let the connector "seat" itself.  It takes about 2 seconds to feel that, then you're an expert.    Oh, don't forget to put the screws back in.

AA11703028	hi mate            the nvidia geforce 8600gt has a power draw of 43watts however with a 220watt psu you would be pushing it to run this card          allthough the geforce 8600gt only has a relatively small power requirement other hardware such as your motherboard,hard drives and optical drives also need to be taken into consideration and this will probally take your total power demands over 220watt          however to be sure go to http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul... and use the "eXtreme Power Supply Calculator Lite v2.5",this is a psu calculator and all you need to do is select the hardware in your p.c from the specification lists,then when you are done press the "calculate" button           you will then receive a total power usage which is a approximate amount of power your p.c requires(in watts)           however to allow for future upgrades and inaccuracy add another 50 to 100watts to the total,this is then the amount in watts your psu needs to be           also you need to consider the +12v rail,this is just as important as the wattage when using a graphic card,and most manufactuers of the 8600gt recommend a minimum 400watt psu with 20A on the +12v rail,allthough again the 8600gt itself only uses around 3A but taking into consideration other hardware this is why the requirement are higher            as for compatible power supplys you can get a decent 400watt psu for less than 25,the Xilence 420W Gaming PSU is just 22.94 inc. VAT from http://www.aria.co.uk/SuperSpecials/Othe... has dual 12v rails with a total of 27A,so this is more than enough to run the geforce 8600gt            another psu worth considering is the "Hiper 425W PSU HPU-4S425"( http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... ),which i bought myself,and its remarkably quiet and ran my geforce 7900gs without any problems             it has braided cables and pci-express connectors aswell as 2 x sata power connectors,and for just 27.03 inc. VAT it represents excellent value             note : allthough a 220watt psu would probally run the geforce 8600gt you would be more prone to crashes and lock-ups and with the graphic card permanently starved for power it would probally damage your current psu ,so a new psu is the best option allround             any problems let me know                    good luck mate !|`|XlyLakYAaa	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gefo...|`|kG1HYpRDaa	Wattage isn't the only thing you have to keep in mind. Most cards need a minimum of 550-650W to operate, but if you want the card to perform as best as it can you need a PSU that outputs over 20 amps on the +12v rail. Look around the PSU and you'll find this small chart that gives the output for each rail. You'll probably want a power supply that supports 500W+ if you are planning on using dual video cards or adding another one later.

2YSKXb8Aaa	Find a friend with the same version of XP as you.  If you have windows home edition, find someone with a home disc.  You don't need their key.  Use the key stickered on your case.  Burn everything you want to keep onto a cd/dvd/flash drive/external hard drive.     Are you saying you can't get WoW back?  You can download WoW off the internet, the trial version works fine if you have a legit account.    After you've backed everything up, google how to reformat a computer.  It's quite simple, and takes about 2-3 hours until your computer is clean as a whistle and fast again.|`|RamplKUPaa	just go to control panel and go to add or remove programs and start removing    or format it and put back what u want|`|AA10064810	Unless you want to completely reformat, you don't need an XP disk.  Just go to the control panel and add and delete and delete any programs you remember adding on.  Be sure to have all other programs closed (usually not necessary, but it will keep you from being distracted).  If you don't recognize a program, click on it or type it in and do a search.  You don't want to drop something that the computer requires to run.    I don't see why you need to add back Wow, etc., unless you do a complete wipe.  You may be able to find a computer repair shop to do a wipe and put back whatever operating system you started with.    Or, contact the computer company and find out how to get a duplicate disk.  I'm pretty sure that this is possible because stuff happens and people do have to start over.

An external hard drive is basicly a flash drive, but with a ton more memory, bigger, and usually needs a wall outlet to power it.  The 3rd options is to just burn the pictures onto cds but that takes along time.

U9n960GYaa	Windows Defender, sure..... but it depends on what site the Active X is for.  Many different websites will install Active X plug-ins into your browser, it's not just one separate program but can be many little different programs.  It just depends on what website wants to use an Active X.  BE CAREFUL... it can leave you computer exposed.    I use Firefox as my only browser so I don't have to worry about the security gaps in Active X controls (Firefox doesn't use Active X)... if you're not careful (I should say one of the unlucky ones).... malware and other bugs can very easily slip into an Active X that has been left open and corrupt your entire system..

As Norton has detected it, it is likely you have it. Because the other programs have not detected it, it could mean that malware has disabled the engine. To delete it, you should use an online engine ie. housecall.trendmicro.com. Otherwise, find the program's name on Task Manager in the processes tab and kill the process. Then you should be able to delete it.

Copy it onto a flash drive a place where you know you can later access.   Create a new account that is administrator and do not use this for normal day to day activities. Make sure you password protect the account.   Then create your account as a limit for your normal day to day use. This is to limit the ability of viruses should they enter.   Copy your files onto your account using your mum's account considering she still has administrator's privileges.   Then log onto the the new admin account and make her account a limited user.    OR    Restart your computer. During the restart press F8 and select safe mode. A hidden Administrator's account will appear

7PdpuJa4aa	Does the adapter have any software that needs to be installed first? It's either a bad driver or bad adapter.  After you plugged the card directly into the computer and got the 1 song on, did you mean you took it out and plugged it back into the computer and it didn't show anything, or you had taken it out and put it on your phone?  I would check your phone manual and make sure the songs are on the right format. They should aslo have a FAQs section as well.  I'm not sure if you are using a desktop or a laptop, but a lot of laptops are Bluetooth enabled (your phone most likely is as well), you can transfer your files that way which would probably work a lot easier.  Good luck!
MGyzOIKqaa	go on youtube on a library computer|`|uyj52zs3aa	the problem that you have is that you DO have the recovery disk and your not using it right if you ask me. First make sure you are using the right disk. If you downloaded it that means you probably just burned it into a disk like any other data file, but its not how its done. remember .iso files are image files and need to be burned a special way. Use nero or sonic even. Once you burn cd right the rest is much simpler...look up burning .iso files|`|eqaUMrYZaa	When you turn on your computer press F12 right away , then load your CD and press the option to load it from your CDROM Drive.Then go through the Recovery Disc from there.    Make sure you know how to use the Recovery Disc .    That should work.    Edit: Thats what I did on XP , do not know if Vista is different.    Also on XP what I tried before the recovery disc is when you turn on the computer press F8 right away and choose"START WINDOWS FROM THE LAST KNOWN GOOD CONFIGURATION" also in F8 you can use SAFE MODE and back up your files if you want.|`|8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	If you didn't get that recovery disk from Microsoft (at least via Dell should that be possible), THAT is your problem.
AA11703028	hi kyle                 yes,the mobile version of the geforce 9600gt is one of the best notebook graphic adapters around,and allthough its specifications are slightly different to its desktop version it still packs a considerable punch                your laptops specifications are also very good,the core 2 duo T6400 is a strong laptop processor and rated at 2ghz this is more than powerful enough to handle games like bioshock and far cry2 and as for world of warcraft you should be able to max out the settings and detail for a enjoyable gaming experience            4gb of ddr2 ram is more than enough for todays games and the gigabit(1000mbps) ethernet adapter means you shouldnt have any lag(slow down) when playing online games such as wow               and finally with the amount of updates required for wow the 320gb hard drive has this covered,so in summary you should experience no problems at all             however if there was one negative point its the 15.4" lcd display,allthough this is ok for any laptop you are missing out when running games at this size display since you are limited to a resolution of only 1280x800               on the whole kyle a excellent laptop and some brilliant specifications,also remember the 9600M supports the "physx" feature found in all nvidia 8/9 and gtx series cards,for more information and a list of physx compatible games go to http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvidia_phys...             great laptop mate                   good luck kyle !|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Sounds like you have a good card and a good CPU - I'd be surprised if this didn't run okay.

yvikwdohaa	It's similar to myspace,  but easier to navigate. It's called facebook because it's supposed to be a "book of faces" of all your friends and family. you can add applications to your profile including games, horoscopes, and things like honesty box (which lets you send your friends "honest" messages anonymously) and bathroom wall. you can send messages through inboxing, and facebook chat is like an instant messenger. You can join groups, become fans of bands, and plan/attend events. There is also marketplace, which is similar to ebay. Facebook is basically the best thing on the internet right now.|`|AA10634053	Facebook is a social networking website  to connect with your friends and with your friends friends.Users can select to join one or more participating networks, such as a school, place of employment, geographic region, or social group.u can change ur settings n u have an option whether only ur friends or everyone can see ur profile .|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Facebook is a marketing tool for multinational companys.Heck,dont worry about what your friends will be able find out.Worry about all the unwanted offers you are about to receive from people you didnt know even existed.They will know everything you put into facebook real soon.|`|PauslbY0aa	its similar to myspace, but without all the BS formats and everything. so you can actually read people's pages.. altho there are lots of addons. so there is some clutter on people's pages sometimes. i like it more. its alot cleaner looking. less teenybopper bs.|`|Lth8UVJfaa	Yeah it's like myspace but better in a way i guess because it seems to be like the college crowd that is on there...ppl can only see ur profile if u add them and it's not like myspace where u can add ur background and layout and stuff.|`|7BRJhrABaa	FACEBOOK IS :is a free-access social networking website that is operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc.[1] Users can join networks organized by city, workplace, school, and region to connect and interact with other people. People can also add friends and send them messages, and update their personal profiles to notify friends about themselves. The website's name refers to the paper facebooks depicting members of a campus community that some US colleges and preparatory schools give to incoming students, faculty, and staff as a way to get to know other people on campus.    BASICALLY ITS LIKE MYSPACE ONLY THING IS THAT YOU CANNOT CUSTOMIZE YOUR LAYOUT/PROFILE AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS CAN READ YOUR COMMENTS, SEE YOUR PICTURES THAT YOU UPLOADED, READ ANYTHING THAT YOU PUT OR WROTE TO SOMEONE. ITS NOT PRIVATE ONLY IF YOU SET IT PRIVATE TO VIEW FRIENDS ONLY BUT EVERYONE CAN READ WHAT YOU HAVE POSTED EXCEPT "EMAILS/PRIVATE MSGS"|`|vgLkcBqkaa	It's pretty much the mature-social site.

gsAmfCVMaa	I really don't know the prices, but first you have to know what exactly is your laptop problem.  the most expensive one is that your LCD is broken and then you have to replace the whole LCD.  the other one which the price is in middle range is the LCD fluorescent lamp.  and the cheapest one the the graphic card.|`|FONse7Ijaa	This question is vague.  If you mean that it does not work any longer, and if it is not under warranty, there is no way to fix it.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It wouldn't - screens are replaced, not repaired.

hWlCGcMSaa	yes if you download ubuntu linux, it is quite like windows. It has a utility "add/remove programs" that brings up a list of programs in different categorys that you can download for whatever task. Windows programs will not work in ubuntu the way they are installed. The ubuntu cd also gives you the option to run a trial run direct off the cd without installing anything if you want to try it first.|`|CKE9oLlZaa	You will be better off with mandriva 2009 in my opinion (than Ubuntu) because it is easier to install and use. If you choose the KDE4 desktop environment you will find this closer to being like windows when it comes to controlling the environment and settings that are used to.  You need to download the Linux of your choice to a CD using an iso writer for windows  To get a better idea of what to do and to familiarise yourself with the new operating system - go to You Tube and watch a few videos especially one on dual booting XP   You will then have more specific questions to ask. You can google those or come back here. Email me personally if you decide to dual boot with Ubuntu or Mandriva - others on here are also willing to help.   Google 'wubi' and read about this as it will give you the chance to try Ubuntu before making the 'big step' of partitioning your HDD    Good Luck
4MYWPD9Yaa	If you have to ask, I think you'd be better off not installing to a partition.    Ubuntu has this beautiful thing called Wubi that allows you to set up a dual-boot without repartitioning or replacing the Windows boot loader. It allows you to easily install and uninstall a dual-boot with Linux just as you would any normal Windows program.    More details here:  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/wubi|`|C8Ex3PKeaa	If you are new to Linux, which I'm assuming you are, then the easiest and safest way is to download Ubuntu, which is the most common and easiest Linux distribution.

cp30vrVoaa	I am guessing that you want to replace your 350 GB hard disk with an 750 GB hard disk and you want to run Windows Vista on your computer then.    You would have to buy a 750 GB disk that is compatible with your controller. If your current disk drive is an E-IDE drive, you will have to get a new 750 GB E-IDE drive and remove your old drive, then put the new one in.     Then you need to have an installable version of Windows Vista. You basically install the operating system from CD or DVD. The installation process will guide you through all necessary steps.    I would strongly advise not to do an upgrade from XP to Vista and not to try and copy any programs or executables from your current XP installation to the new Windows Vista.|`|awi9fvXwaa	well once you put in the larger hard drive, just install vista on it if you have a vista cd. you cannot just swap a 350gb hard drive with xp on it with a hard drive with vista already on it. you need to install the 750 gb hard drive into the computer, then install vista.|`|CA5fVwScaa	Yes it is possible.  Firstly you need the items in question.  Then install the new hard drive.  You will need some sort of boot disk/partition tool to create a primary partition on the new hard drive, then format it.  Then set your bios to boot from the dvd/cd drive, insert the vista disk, reset the pc.  The vista installation disk will start to boot.  Follow the on screen prompts, install the drivers and there ya go.  This is a very brief explanation of what the process entails, but there are plenty of tutorials out there on the web to help.

ebuxHnScaa	It sounds like a hardware issue. The most likely is heat. The second most likely is RAM.    Check the RAM first. Burn a memtest86+ CD and boot from it. Let it run for a few hours. One error is too many.    Then check for heat issues. Clean any excess dust. Make sure the power supply, CPU, and video card fans are clean and that they spin freely when power is applied.|`|9gdJNTajaa	Im not an expert like the latter, but i would narrow it down to either RAM or CPU.  I doubt its your graphics card because when graphics cards get hot they just reboot your computer.  If you are running an old copy of windows try re-installing or even better formatting the drive and re-installing it, most of the time a simple re install of the os solves the problems, hope you get it fixed and sorted asap :)

uAOkRBA0aa	Currently, there is not any solution that offers a 100% effectiveness rate   for detecting viruses and malware.

So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

It is a more stable and reliable version of Internet Explorer and inlcudes new features such as tab recovery that may help solve the issues you are experiencing    This is a great site that actually gives you the opportunity to test some of the new security features in IE8: http://www.ie8demos.com/tryit/      The official site also provides a good overview of all the new features, as well as answers for many frequently asked questions that users have. You can download it here as well if you think its something you might want to try out: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/interne...    This is a release candidate, so it is in the final stages of testing, but not the final version of IE8.    I hope this helps,    Feran   Internet Explorer Outreach Team|`|OcovssgKaa	Firefox 2 was the most stable browser. Right now on Windows I recommend Google Chrome http://www.google.com/chrome    LUg.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Firefox is on 3.0.5, by the way.    You're looking at this the wrong way. if there's a common thread to what's crashing the browsers, THAT is the problem. You have to fix THAT problem to cure the issue. You're treating the symptom (browser crashes, install another browser).    This is like hearing a noise from your car's engine, and turning up the radio to hide the noise. You don't hear the noise, but there's still a problem.    You've probably already figured it out. If it crashes when you have Flash content loaded, you need to uninstall that application/plugin and get a new version.    Oh, and I never have browser crashes.|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Never, am using Chrome.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	mine crashes at least twice every night|`|XyWr8lDyaa	I have a mac and am a safari user. I love safari.

You should check the system requirements before you download a browser.
SgQa4zjTaa	If column A is the employee initials and column B is the ratings    =COUNTIF(A:A,"AB")  This gives you the number of entries employee  AB has    =SUMIF(A:A,"AB",B:B)  Gives you the total of all the ratings for employee AB    To get an Average rating for employee AB  =SUMIF(A:A,"AB",B:B)/COUNTIF(A:A,"AB")    You say you want a weighted average but you don't specify what weight you want to give to individual ratings. You would need to specify say the last rating is worth 50% of the overall rating or something like that.    If you want to count how many 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, and 5's employee AB has    1's  =SUMPRODUCT( (A1:A100="AB")*(B1:B100=1))    2's  =SUMPRODUCT( (A1:A100="AB")*(B1:B100=2))    3's  =SUMPRODUCT( (A1:A100="AB")*(B1:B100=3))    4's  =SUMPRODUCT( (A1:A100="AB")*(B1:B100=4))    5's  =SUMPRODUCT( (A1:A100="AB")*(B1:B100=5))

CCf6Y7DIaa	it sounds like your computer is out of date. try updating the video drivers (i recommend CCCP: http://www.cccp-project.net/ ). if that doesn't work, try a different video player like bsplayer or vlc or media player classic. if none of those work, well, try shutting down some background programs; as implausible as it may sound, with higher resolution video files and higher bitrate audio, you may need to update your computer to get smooth video playback (PS: you need a gig plus of ram for xp and at least 2 gigs for vista).    -please update your post with more details about your computer (os, cpu, ram, graphics card, favored media program) to get more specific help.

g62ATenqaa	If it is not only Google but other sites that you do not see images, it could be our settings. Click on Tools, in Internet Explorer, down to Internet Options and click on the advanced tab.  scroll down till you see the multimedia category and then place a tick by the side of view picture (or similar wording).|`|S3pgtJGpaa	You should save your things and restart your browser. If that doesn't work, then go to a different search engine, like   http://www.yahoo.com  http://www.ask.com  http://www.dogpile.com  and so on. They all have image searches. Although I know Google is a good search engine, if the pictures don't show you'll just have to try something else.   I hope this helps.|`|PfeVl8dHaa	Reload the cache
ZhkLlt8Yaa	They are both basically the same but the OC 1 would be a tinsy bit faster.  It is also the cheaper 1 so i would go with that 1.

For the price you are looking to pay, I suggest getting the 9800 GT or the 8800 GT.  This card is for improved gaming and is around the same price.    Here are a couple links.

uYUGdcfzaa	Is the fan still spinning, is it always on or is it intermittent?  No fan spinning at all - panic.  Always on - either an older laptop or if newer a sign that the fan may have worked loose or insufficient thermal compound used in manufacture.  Intermittent - usually a sign that all is well, however the thermostat might be malfunctioning.    Lastly is there sufficient airflow around the laptop? You'd be surprised.................    EDIT. Are you tinkering in the BIOS? If so, change all the memory/voltage settings etc. back to normal. A laptop isn't really suited for over-clocking - the stock fans just can't deliver the through-put of air to keep them cool enough. Going back to my last point above the thermostat is sometimes in the fan mounting, rather than on the mobo. This is a cheap component to buy to narrow down what's actually wrong rather than giving it straight to a Techie.|`|p6xgtONXaa	Hi,    The problem is no doubt an internal problem such as a cooling fan not working or the thermal paste under the cpu has gone dry.    You will need to take it to a repair shop.    Arnak|`|DSOJvIhtaa	An internal fan probably died. You'll have to get it replaced.|`|AA11100368	mine does it too,  do you have a toshiba?    its because it does not get enough air flow to the bottom where the fans are. stupid design.  try proping it up on some books, but only the very back edge, that works on mine

Plus the chances of getting a virus are way lower!|`|DGA5Rtc4aa	If you make music then the Mac range is good.  You could get a Mac mini or one of the entry level desktops.  The Macs come with software specifically for this purpose: garageband.  Your local Mac store (if you have one) also runs free tutorials on all the software - including garageband.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Nope - each partition has its own directory and structure.  You can't merge those.  You could copy all the directories (folders) and files to an external drive, combine the 3 partitions into one and copy the directories and files back.  BTW, you won't lose data just because a partition is getting full.  When there's no room you just won't be able to save anything more to that partition.|`|tkboFQ16aa	YES! OF COURSE IT IS POSSIBLE TO MERGE THE PARTITIONS IF YOU USE THE SOFTWARE"PARTITION MAGIC". IT CONTAINS FOLOWING THINGS:  1.  resize the partition  2. Merge the partition  3. create a partition  4. alott space to partitions   the thing is that you must learn to uae it becoz it has a pblm of FAT AND NTFS. be careful if u r wrong u can lose the data. So, learn abt this software either frm internet or from a Comp. hardware expert who had used the software. rply if you succeed.!!!!

MeeJWmGtaa	Actually, and in contradiction of what anybody else says, YES, you can!    Plug a Linksys WRTG54 router into the DSL or cable modem.  Use a second Linksys WRTG54, or a Linksys WAP54, in your room, or halfway between the modem and your room as a repeater. This one will pick up the wireless signal and re-broadcast it. All it needs to be is plugged into a power outlet, and pick up the wireless signal.    Hope that helps.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	No. Your ISP gives you one modem per account.|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	that won't work if you are not with out getting a second line which mean you will have to pay twice. what you can do is get a wireless repeater also know as an access point. so far I have seen 3 types.     1.the cheapest is the cable to wireless. basically it connects to your wireless modem with a cable and then you run the cable say to a hall or downstairs or where ever your getting a weak signal and then it will give off the wireless signal for that area.    2. this one is cool technolgy wise. it uses your power lines to work like a cable. so what you do is get one device which connects to your wireless modem through a cable that device connects to a power outlet then you can connect the other device to any other power outlet in the house and the wireless signal will come from there. I've seen that one for almost 200 dollars. at least it doesn't come with a monthly fee. amiright.    3. this one is pretty rare and may be the more expensive. it's a stand alone device. all you need to do is give it power and it picks up the wireless signal and then re broadcasts it. so if this device is inbetween your room and the wireless modem it will get the signal which is weak and then rebroad cast it to your area which should give you a much better signal.|`|ZVoYKaYsaa	No. You'll pay for one package.  Unless your agreement states you must used a rented modem, or only one modem, you'll need not to pay double.    As long as you have an ethernet drop in your bedroom, and the drop is hooked up, you should be fine. Be aware, if you want another WIRELESS modem upstairs, you'll need another CORDED modem as well, or a wired/wireless combined modem. However, if you want a plain simple plug it into the computer modem for you room, that's all you'll need.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	I bought an extra one and pay an extra $5 for it without a seperate bill.

SJM0rzHtaa	That cable you linked to is a 5BNC-coaxial VGA cable.  It is intended for connecting to a very high-resolution VGA monitor with 5BNC VGA inputs.  You cannot connect an XBox's A/V output RCA plugs into those 5BNC jacks, which are totally different in signaling characteristics and in physical dimensions.  It won't even fit.
j8hUNXtVaa	Has it worked in the past?    Is there anything like a Samsung/USB device in the Windows Control Panel?  If so, it would be worth removing these and doing an uninstall/install of the printer driver.    This is all presuming you're connected on USB rather than network.  If that's the case, then may be it's worth trying a different connection.

Hwe7pmZRaa	Back up your files before you perform the upgrade! I hope this post is made in time before you went along with the upgrade installation.  When you perform an upgrade installation, your files are written over and you will need to reload the files from your back-up disc along with Vista once the Windows 7 Beta expires on Aug. 1, 2009. Your other option (if you have enough disk space) is to perform a clean installation.  This option will allow you to dual boot Windows 7 alongside Vista.  Once the Beta expires, you will then need to wipe out the Windows 7 partition and go back to using Vista. Here is a tutorial to walk you through this method.        http://lifehacker.com/5126781/how-to-dua...    Cheers,  Jeff  Windows Outreach Team

You could ask the person who uploaded the video to remove that person's comment (they can do it!)

AA11041367	For the HDD, you only need 5 Gig's of free space, minimum.  2 Gigs of Ram is good enough. and a 2.8GHz Processor.|`|M0HTIeutaa	decent for gaming is relative. I suppose its decent now but you are correct, thats not a gaming processor. Try and get a computer with the Intel Core 2 Duos, mine is great and I think they are the current "thing to have"    also a pci express graphics card like the nvidia 8600 or higher would be great for gaming     also maxing out the ram on any computer that you get can only help    hard drive isnt going to really make a difference, but other people may tell you differently. With games you don't want more storage but faster drives like 7200rpm

9ff50eac6fa480a892f8f42861f11968aa	What is your complaint, the quality? Your webcam might not have very good quality at that resolution, and YouTube might degrade it a bit more during upload. Try a different camera or device.
Dfr6uA91aa	Good question. I've been wondering about this myself.    Well I can tell you right off the bat, it won't be found in the catalog. I also highly doubt it's possible to program this sort of thing in TI-Basic either.    What you need is an assembly program to extract the serial ID, encrypt it, then compare it to a set string. While I don't think it's out there yet, check out this page, since it seems like what you're trying to do: http://www.getacoder.com/projects/asm_pr...    If you plan on doing anything that requires the use of higher level functions (such as retrieving an ID), it's better to learn Z80 assembly for that.

5zSSGKBpaa	You cannot INSTALL windows from the flash drive. If you want to boot into windows from your flash drive you have to go into the bios and change the boot order.  To get into bios: when you turn the computer on watch the screen carefully. It should say which key to press to enter bios. If it doesn't say you will have to experiment pressing various keys at startup (Del, space bar, F1-8). After you are in the bios search all the options for "boot order" and move usb up the order ahead of hard drive. Not all computers can boot from the usb.

It would probably be best to delete all the linux partitions and create 1 new partition with them. Then format that new partition as fat32 so windows can use it. Cancel out of the install. If you do not format it to fat32 windows will not be able to use those GBs. Windows cannot handle linux partitions so windows cannot delete/format them.

meysHMilaa	Why do People Create Computer Viruses?    As a computer technician, my clients frequently ask me Why do people create computer viruses?, especially after I have been called out to remove a virus from their computer. This is what I tell them.    There are hundreds of thousands of viruses out there (if not millions) and they often designed for different objectives. Most of them fall under the following categories:        * To take control of a computer and use it for specific tasks      * To generate money      * To steal sensitive information (credit card numbers, passwords, personal details, data etc.)      * To prove a point, to prove it can be done, to prove ones skill or for revenge purposes      * To cripple a computer or network    To Take Control of a Computer and Use It for Specific Tasks    This is the most common type of virus, which is better classified as a trojan. These types of viruses are usually downloaded unknowingly by the computer user thinking that the file is something else, such as a file sent from a instant messenger friend or email attachment.    Once the host computer has been infected (known as a zombie computer), the trojan joins a private chat channel and awaits orders from its Zombie Master. This Zombie Master who is often the virus creator, will gather thousands of infected machines called a botnet and use them to mount attacks on web servers. The Zombie Master can command each of these infected computers will send a tiny bit of information to a web server - because there are potentially thousands of computers doing this at once, it often overloads the server.    The Zombie Master may want to do this to another website because it is a rival website, a figurehead website (such as whitehouse.gov) or it may be part of an extortion plan. Send me $5000 or your Toy selling website will be offline over the Christmas holidays.    The Zombie Master can also use these infected computers to send spam while the zombie master remains anonymous and the blame goes to the infected computers.    To Generate Money  These types of infections often masquerade as free spyware or virus removal tools (known as rogueware). Once ran, these fake applications will scan your computer and say it found has someviruses (even if there arent any) and in order to remove them, you must pay for the full version of the application. A good example of such a infection is called Myzor.fk which we have written about in the past.    Steal sensitive information  These types of viruses can sniff the traffic going in or out of a computer for interesting information such as passwords or credit card numbers and send it back to the virus creator. These types of viruses often use keylogging as a method of stealing information where it maintains a record of everything that is typed into the computer such as emails, passwords, home banking data, instant messenger chats etc..  The above mentioned methods also allows an attacker to gather an incredible amount of data about a person which can be used for identity theft purposes.    To Prove a Point, To Prove it Can Be Done, To Prove Ones Skill or For Revenge Purposes  A perfect example of this type of virus was the famous MS.Blaster virus (aka Lovesan) which infected hundreds of thousands of computers back in August 2003.    This virus would cause the system to restart after 60 seconds and had two hidden messages written in its code:  One was I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!! which is why the virus is sometimes called Lovesan, and the other message was billy gates why do you make this possible ? Stop making money and fix your software!!  It is believed that purpose of this virus was to prove how easily exploitable a Windows system is.    To Cripple a Computer or Network  Few viruses now days are intended to disable a computer because it stops viruses ability to spread to other computers. Computer crippling viruses still exist, but nowhere near as common as the viruses mentioned above. The worst type of computer crippling viruses were back in the days of the 486 computers where the virus would overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the computer which would often prevent the computer from starting up at all.    Unlike computer crippling viruses, network crippling viruses are all too common now days. Most viruses that are designed to launch a Denial of Service attack will cause a significant load on a computer network, often bringing it down completely.

Anyway, I think the best solution for you is to size your player down to maybe just a start/stop button (yes this is possible with the playlist).  There are other re-sizing options as well.    Go here:  http://xiii.us/eGen/mpSkin.php    Choose the size you want, from the choices, and then choose a color or a skin (or not).  You can also choose to position the player in a top corner, or elsewhere.  Lots of options there.

6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa	Gerri, you sound young, and therefore I am going to assume that you may be more gullible than someone with more experience. I am going to give you two facts about Wikipedia, and if they don't help make up your mind, then you may be beyond assistance from adults.    Taner Akcam. Have you ever heard of him? He is an author and professor who teaches about Turkey's role in Armenia. He has political opponents around the world who hold more nationalistic views of Turkey. One day, Akcam was flying from Minnesota to Montreal, to deliver a lecture at a university there. He missed the lecture because he was detained for 4 hours in the airport. Why? Airport security looked him up on Wikipedia and they read that Taner Akcam was involved with terrorist organizations. Even though this was false information maliciously entered into Wikipedia, Akcam's civil rights were violated.    Here's another fact. The Wikipedia article about Jackson, Michigan recently corrected a piece of misinformation about Abraham Lincoln. The article had said that Lincoln attended the first convention of the Republican Party, in Jackson. The thing is, Lincoln only ever visited Michigan once in his life, and it was a trip to Kalamazoo and had nothing to do with the convention in Jackson. Guess how long this error persisted in Wikipedia? A few minutes? A day or two? A week?    No, the error was in place for 600 days, Gerri.    That's why you are a fool if you think Wikipedia should be considered a credible source for research.|`|5436ebd85cea70ce327c74d3cfdc1597aa	no it is not considered a good source for a research paper.  no professor would accept it.  however, it can be a good place to start research which will often lead to good sources.|`|AzeOk29saa	To do simple homework, wikipedia is a great source.

I personally consider Wikipedia to be a pretty good source, except for highly controversial topics.  For articles containing basic facts, it's pretty useful.    It could be cited as one of many sources; you couldn't realistically use it for the majority of your sources, as that would be too one-sided and unreliable.|`|AA10719402	Never ever use Wikipedia for a college paper.  You can use the external links or the sources IN wikipedia to get more reputable sources.

Yes wikipedia is very convenient...but it is definitely not a reputable source!|`|OAo5t5FRaa	sord of, ppl can edit it|`|2OyG5judaa	No, not at all - its a good starting point. However, you need to research the information you find there and find a good source. I would bet you would be marked off for using them as a source. High school teachers don't even accept it.    Would I trust the information? Yes, its often great and helpful, but I would NEVER cite them as a source in a research paper.|`|AA11717111	Yeah, I believe that most college professors would mark you down.    Is it a reliable source? Yes, because it provides references more often than not. Well developed and popular articles like this:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_stat...    are for the most part impartial and accurate (even if the subject itself is controversial).

In this case, you want it to overprint to achieve an effect similar to the way commercial printers use varnish.    "1. Select the object or objects that you want to overprint.   2. In the Attributes panel, select Overprint Fill, Overprint Stroke, or both."    If you've already tried this and it didn't work, try it again.

Go to Control Panel > Add or Remove programs >  AVG > Change/Remove    Install ccleaner from ccleaner.com and do both the Run Cleaner and then Registry > Scan for Issues - this will get rid of stuff left behind in the registry after uninstalling programs.  When prompted, don't Back Up, and Yes, you are sure.  ccleaner is a great free fast clean up tool that everyone should use weekly.    If you were unable to uninstall AVG, use Sytem Restore to bring your computer back to a time before you tried to install AVG.

It's not configured to receive requests from other computers for that web page nor does it know how to respond to those requests to send the web page out to them.     To do that, you need to install and run a piece of software called a "web server". You would also need to have this software and your computer running 24/7 if you want people to get your web page at any time of day/night.    This is more overhead than most people want to deal with, so instead, you can acquire the services of a "web hosting service" that already has web server machines running and can give you some amount of space on their machine. The better web hosting services are expensive, but there are free services with limited features.|`|Vax4IHX2aa	You should first set up a web server. As said above, Apache is a good one, and can be installed from http://apache.org/. When installing, make sure to host the server on port 80, which is the HTTP server. Read the instructions about placing your html in the correct folder to host. Next, you may need to set up port forwarding on your router, if you use one. Refer to your router help information to find out how to do this. Then you should go to a web site such as http://wanip.info/ or http://whatismyip.com/ to get your router's WAN ip address. If everything has been set up correctly, then when you go to the WAN ip address of your router, you should get your html file. There are also quite a few tutorials online; just search on http://google.com/

qbQT7oMtaa	I tried rosetta for Spanish. It does not have any translation, grammar or conjugation instructions so it will be very hard to go beyond the basics with it. It is good for the basics as it is pure memorization. There is no way to be fluent with it. Their program is based on the same thing where you see these 4 pictures over and over again. I was disappointed especially for the price I paid.    My college uses tell me more. My goal was to become fluent so it was perfect for me and I bought their individual version. It has a lot of different activities: picture/word association, videos, dialogues,..., includes also grammar and conjugation. It has also more content than any other language software. Their speech recognition is great so you can have a dialogue with the computer. You can contact them to get a free demo http://www.tellmemore.com and also ask for a Rosetta Stone demo to compare, visit independent reviews websites(About.com, http://www.toptenreviews.com...).     The best way to learn a language would be through immersion, visiting these countries. Learning a language will require some time. In addition to software, you can have books which are useful as well. Audio CDs like Pimsleur for instance might help you out but you cannot get any feedback on your pronunciation so I did not like it so much|`|NACSpiUoaa	Rosetta stone is good  and really basic they use a picture association to drill you down with sentences and words not to mention expensive especially when you have to get all levels. I actually have the level one French from Rosetta stone. You might want to check out a company called TELL ME MORE it's cheaper and they have a lot of good reviews by consumers plus its cheaper. Last time I checked all five levels was only $289.99. sometimes even less with free shipping you can't beat that.    here's the link  www.tellmemorestore.com

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.    Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?    Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  Its only for the Windows operating system.    First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    Second, if youre interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings.     http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...    Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.    Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), heres a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.    Good luck.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Sounds as if you had a trial version of Microsoft Office.    Pay to get a full license.    Or just use OpenOffice instead.

By "magnetic ink" I am assuming you asking about check printing ink so you can print your own checks.    It's called MICR.  MICR stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition.

Otherwise, we'll need the motherboard brand and model and it is sometimes helpful to know what power supply you have. It's also helpful to know what video you have, as that will determine whether it makes sense to upgrade.    DDR2 RAM is actually for most current computers. But your computer requires DDR RAM, which is older than DDR2 RAM. It is available is larger sizes, but your motherboard may or may not support it.    If you have a single 512MB stick of memory, your best option may be to add a second 512MB stick. This will get you 1GB of RAM, be very cheap, and if your motherboard support dual-channel memory, this will actually make the memory faster. Whether or not this will work depends on what motherboard you have.    Most likely, your computer has an AGP slot, since AGP was popular through most of the time when motherboards that take DDR memory was made.    You can find out what's in your computer (though not anything about the power supply) with SiW, which is free. See the first link below.    Update: Sounds like you have a 512MB stick and a 128MB stick. The best upgrade is to get two 1GB sticks. See all links but the first.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	There are a myriad of questions that you would need to answer before upgrading either your memory or video card.    Both memory chips and video cards come in different formats.  The kind you need depends on the motherboard you have installed in your computer.    The best advice I can give you is to find someone that KNOWS computers to take a look at yours and let you know what to look for.  You can't just go out and by any memory or video card you want... it may not work for your computer.|`|Qu4Pufuhaa	you can get a one gig stick for about $30-35 from tigerdirect.com or fro a local best buy store. that is the biggest the come in.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Some monitors have a swivel mount that lets you arrange them vertically, but they are usually at the expensive end of the range.  Obviously yours doesn't have that feature, so you'll have to find some way to prop it up vertically.  Make sure that you provide adequate ventilation, as monitors designed for horizontal use might have vents designed to work only in that position.    If you're going to change orientations a lot, you'd be better off buying a monitor that has the swivel mount.

For you, it'll probably be okay, but the fact it's a Dell Inspiron (the basic model, where they cut as many corners and use as many cheap parts as they can) would cause me to be wary.

I got the inspiron (the lowest level dell makes) and the usb and monitor plugs are broken. It doesn't read anything that is plugged into the usb or  monitor plugs. It is basic and will break too easy. The RAM should be 2 or 3 GB if you are going to game, and a 160GB hard drive will be good for schoolwork and music, no apps games or videos.

TXJXcVu0aa	Follow the advice of the first poster, but sometimes many small files can also cause this problem. If you have no joy with the first posters advice then go into my computer and into your c:\ drive right click on each folder within there and select properties. In the properties tab of each folder you will get a total file size. Using this method find out where most of your disk space has been taken up. I.e. if i right clicked on program files and it said the disk usage was 120gb i would go in there then right click the sub folders to get there individual sizes. Eventually you will find the culprit and be able to rectify your problem.    Have you checked for hidden system files (folder options - show hidden files, and show system protected files) It may be something like a temporary file. If you have msn messenger and still want to find out what this problem is then email me, i am willing to connect to your computer using "remote assistance" im sure i will be able to find the problem within 5-10 minutes. Obviously requires a bit of trust on your part but apart from the above suggestions i cant really advise anything else by without looking at it personally.

It is a slow sort that is resource and time inefficient. I would suggest a QuickSort or Radix Sort. You can find examples here.
pXzvu866aa	You have a decent start there, but the first problem is that the seqOrderedSearch function should not be inside main( ). You didn't include your selectionSort function, but you may have already coded it. I also think the logic of your search function can be simplified. Putting it all together into a working program, here's what I think it should look like:      include     using namespace std;    void selectionSort(int list[], int length);  int seqOrderedSearch(const int list[], int len, int x);  void find(int *, int len, int x);    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {  ? ? int list[] = {81, 13, 27, 7, 56, 38, 2, 99, 69, 24};  ? ? int len = sizeof(list) / sizeof(list[0]);    ? ? selectionSort(list, len);    ? ? cout   ? ? for (int i = 0; i   ? ? ? ? cout   ? ? }  ? ? cout     ? ? find(list,len,38);  ? ? find(list,len,999);  ? ? find(list,len,2);  ? ? find(list,len,99);  ? ? find(list,len,-1);    ? ? return 0;  }    int seqOrderedSearch(const int list[],int length,int searchItem) {  ? ? int loc = 0;  ? ? while ((loc   ? ? if ((loc == length) || (list[loc] != searchItem)) loc = -1;  ? ? return loc;  }    void find(int *list, int len, int x) {  ? ? cout   ? ? int i = seqOrderedSearch(list,len,x);  ? ? if (i == -1) cout   ? ? else cout   }    void selectionSort(int *a, int n) {  ? ? int min, t;    ? ? for (int i = 0; i   ? ? ? ? min = i;  ? ? ? ? for (int j = i+1; j   ? ? ? ? ? ? if (a[j]   ? ? ? ? }  ? ? ? ? t = a[min];  ? ? ? ? a[min] = a[i];  ? ? ? ? a[i] = t;  ? ? }  }     if 0    Program output:    After sorting, the list elements are:  2 7 13 24 27 38 56 69 81 99  38 found at location 5  999 not found  2 found at location 0  99 found at location 9  -1 not found     endif

xfpJGBfwaa	Don't listen to those guys, sister.  You can build a PC.  It's not that hard.  You can reuse many of the parts you already have (hard drive, network card, optical drives).   You'll save money and you'll have the best gaming PC for your needs.      For a computer at this level, it shouldn't cost you more than $1200 to build your own, assuming you're reusing some parts.  And you'll have a better PC than what you can buy for that money.    For what you're looking at playing, I'd recommend that you focus on the statistics you need for World of Warcraft.  It is the most advanced game with the most stringent requirements.  Here they are:  http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.x...    Use a video card actually mentioned by name in the requirements.  And DO NOT use a version of Direct X higher or lower than the one needed by your game.  In this case, DX9.      That means, you need Windows XP, because Windows Vista would force you to use DX 10.  Which might work, but it would probably be buggy for the older games, especially Sims 2.    http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...    I know it's expensive, but i highly recommend you buy the full version, and single-user license of Windows XP. "Single user" will allow you to install that copy of Windows on whatever machine you're using right now because it's licensed to YOU not the machine.  OEM means it's licensed to the machine, not to you, and once you install it, you can't install it someplace else.  You can use the Single-user XP as a basis for an upgrade later on if you want also.      Once you have one part, such as the video card, decided upon, everything else falls into place (because the card will be either PCI-e or AGP or PCI, which will force certain choices in motherboard.  Also your requirements will force a certain choice in processor, which will force you to choose a socket 775 type motherboard.  So that will narrow the choices down too.      Building a PC is just a matter of weeding out the things you don't need, and choosing among the those that are left. Usually only one or two choices are left once you've got your requirements.      As far as hard drives.  You can just use the one you have.  But this is what I recommend:  Get an external USB hard drive.  Put all your data on it from your old PC.  And then find out what your hard drive's speed is.  If it's anything lower than 7200 rpm, then maybe think about getting a new hard drive.  Hard drive speeds make a difference in games.      As for the USB hard drive, use it to make easy backups of your data from now on.  You won't have to worry about a crash anymore because your data will be safe.  Just find out where your game saves are and make sure you include that in your backups.  You don't have to be a genius to see how valuable that is.|`|0r7qmf0gaa	Cyberpower does a decent job at building "budget gaming" computers.  The builds are not the highest quality - you will get things like dual-channel ram installed in the wrong slots or low-quality power supplies and cases.  Overall not a bad way to go.    Ultimately it is better if you price and build your own - If you have the time and are willing to learn you will save yourself some money.|`|qzOHljFnaa	It really depends a lot on what kind of games you play and whether you want to build your own system. I presume you don't have the experience to build your own (which is by far the cheapest means and also allows for upgrades down the road) so you'll have to by from a retailer. From experience the best/cheapest rigs come from Dell. Since your games are not extremely graphics intensive you won't need to spend much. A good dual core, maybe the Core 2 Duo E7300, 3 GB RAM and a low-end videocard like the Geforce 8600GT or ATI 3450 should suffice. You can put these together in a Dell Inspiron build at their website.      I would like to add that the answer beneath mine is nonsense. First, not everyone can just go out and build a computer, oftentimes putting the pieces together is the easiest part. The difficulty is knowing what parts you need (its like a puzzle) not every part works with another and how to troubleshoot when things don't work right at first for they rarely do.    Also, the ranting about which windows you need is ridiculous, all the games you mention, as with any game made after 2003 works perfectly with Vista and directx is not an issue ever, just update when you need to.    DON'T ever use a USB harddrive as your primary drive, they are much more prone to failure and are not designed to be used as extensively as an internal drive.    Actually, please just don't read that answer. I have 15 years of PC building experience and they're obviously incompetent.    If you really want to try building one yourself consult the forums at www.tomshardware.com extensively. There are many people there who will help you every step of the way and they are much more knowledgeable than folks around here.    Also, for those games have these as parts as a minimum.    Dual core processor (AMD 64x2 4000+ or better, or a Intel Core 2 Duo E5400)    PCI express videocard with at least 256MB memory (Nvidia GeForce 8600GT or ATI X1650) DO NOT use AGP cards.    1-2GB RAM for XP or 3GB for Vista

k5KuYkkKaa	I just bought the same system from Dell last month. The only difference is that I didn't order mine with a graphics card. Didn't seem like a good idea at the time, because I needed to change the power supply (only 300 watts) to put a decent graphics card in it. Check for a Dell flyer in the sunday news paper, you should be able to get that system for less money, I did and I paid $616 when I gave them the code in the flyer. That graphics card will work fine in that system seeing how you're not going to be gaming with it.|`|3FXJtjq6aa	64bit doesn't have really anything to do with graphics, so yes it would.. But the computer (from what I'm hearing) doesn't seem to be worth 764$ especially if your not gaming with it, and since 80% of all programs aren't even compatible with 64bit, anything 64bit is pretty lame, I suggest you get an XP compatible computer, or simply switch operating systems, cause Vista sucks, and once Microsoft figured that out they started right on a new operating system called Windows 7 which from what I've checked from its Beta, its pretty neat.. I suggest you definatly not buy that computer you have there.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Well it will let you do about anything, even gaming, just nothing new.    If you truely just want an email and DVD computer, i suggest you go to goodwill and get one for 200-400 bucks.   Or better, on craigslist and get one for 25-100 bucks.  Save you lots of money...      I am sure Dell has lowergrade computers that are cheaper. Just get the CHEAPEST thing they have if must buy from dell and are only gunna use it for internet surfing and movies :)    edit:  for the 64bit issue.  Anything OLD will have problems running on 64bit, mainly drivers for like webcams, old printers, old NIC cards. A few programs such as games have problems w ith 64bit, most work just fine though.  Vista is alright, those specs are plenty of good enough to run vista 64bit without any issues.    People just ditch vista cause they do not want to get the RAM for it :) It is not bad, it just needs more RAM. I run 16gigz of RAM in mine, not one lick of lag for anything even with 3 games open :D|`|IYgiWL3Haa	It is a fairly good system for the price. The CPU and video car are really the only down points.    CPU: ~$90  Vista: ~$130  Memory: ~$80  Hard Drive: ~$60  DVD drives: ~$35  Video Card: ~$60    After the misc items, motherboard, power supply and case you'd come out about the same building one so good deal. The video card is fine so long as you won't be doing a lot of gaming. The best part about this computer is that it is easily upgradeable to a great CPU and a great video card.|`|FY33nijBaa	I think this is good setup/configuration at the moment but the technology changes fast so best way to use you hardware efficiently is to keep using upgrades versions of softwares.

If it has only one thread (very common), it will run on only one processor.

You need to use HTML forms, which will require adding a ... around your table that contains the  tags.  You also need a way to uniquely identify each input tag.  Right now, each input is named "gra" which means there is no way for the updates to pass along each record that is changed.  You would need something like ' name='gra' ...>.  This way, each input tag corresponds to the row that is being displayed.  You will also need a submit button to submit the changes to the processUpdates.php page.

8nLuyDmPaa	1. Yes, you can have motherboard with more than one processor.  Most, but not all are on Servers.   Some high end graphics workstations and some gamers have duel processor computers.    2. Hyper-threading.  Essentially, before there was multiple core processors, intel came out with hyper-threading. These were not multiple core processors.  Some servers and workstations with multiple processors had hyper-threading.  This was good for programs that were written to take advantage of it, such as Microsoft SQL Server.  Below is one simple definition you can find around for hyper-threading:    Hyper-threading is a technology developed by Intel Corporation. It is used in certain Pentium 4 processors and all Intel Xeon processors. Hyper-threading technology, commonly referred to as "HT Technology," enables the processor to execute two threads, or sets of instructions, at the same time    3. Now on to dual, quad, and however many cores they slap in processors in the future.  These are better than the older hyper-threaded processors, as there is more hardware on the chip.  There are real processor cores instead of two threads of instructions.  The newest Intel chips have 4 real cores and is hyper-threaded to boot.|`|044IeGstaa	Yes, it's possible.

It sounds like you're either looking at the old Intel Pentium 4's with HT, or the new Core i7.    Hyperthreading is one Physical processor, and one Virtual processor. There aren't two processors, it's just seen as two.  About Hyperthreading Technology,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threa...  (The new Intel Core i7 is a Quad Core. It has HT. This means there are Eight processor cores! 4 Real ones, and 4 Virtual ones!)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_...|`|5e27a835ce8832ab93d38acd90eeadadaa	Some motherboards have dual cpu sockets not to be confused with single cpu socket dual-core. 2x quad core is an octocore.  hyper-threading is a generic dual core cpu.|`|mKpmgDbFaa	Hyperthreading is for dual-core processors, however there are some server motherboards that have more than one physical processor.|`|4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	Yes, there are motherboards that support multiple processors.

SbAgNCm0aa	Try to reinstall windows, but this time make sure to pick the option of a complete reformat of your hard drive, not the quick format option.    All else fails, call Dell|`|aMdLmbRwaa	Did you format first or just reinstall on top of the old one? Always format before installing xp.|`|vLJTz6zbaa	It would be helpful if you explained what method you used to re-install.    The most effective way is to do a proper format first (http://www.dban.org is great).  Then install from a XP disk.  Then install the drivers.    You likely can't connect to the internet because your network adapter driver has been deleted. The freezing up of the system just following an install would likely not happen if you did it clean by formatting first.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Actually the "doesn't connect to the internet" part is by design.  You don't want your PC to connect right now. It would be wiped out by a virus in about 8 seconds.  Seriously, research it.  It takes less than 10 seconds to get a virus if you're unprotected and connected right now.  There are many steps to take before you connect.  This is why you should have paid somebody to do this for you.      But don't panic.  What's the worst that will happen?  You have to reinstall again?  So what?  Nothing horrible will happen.  It will just take time and effort.      It's freezing when it's starting up because something in the hardware is either not detected correctly by Windows (and therefore incorrectly installed) - this happens all the time.  Or you need to install your drivers from the resource CD.  I know you said nothing happens.  Somehow you have to start that up.  Get to the Cd drive and double click it, or explore it and find an autorun file and double click that.      I've worked with Resource CD's from Dell (actually many of them), they may not be very helpful even if you can get them running.  A better way is to go to the Dell website and download the drivers for your PC.      It's helpful to have a second computer that works to help you get a nonworking computer going again.  Dig out your old computer and as soon as you start it up (before you do anything else), go to Windows update.  This will keep it from getting wiped out by the thousands of worms wandering the internet - for a while.  Try to update the antivirus on it too, but it may not work.  Keep it off, or with the internet wire unplugged when you're not using it to download drivers for your new PC.      Or, get a friend to come over and help you with their computer.  You will also need a flash drive or a couple of CDs to burn.      (You may wish to also download some Windows Updates with a second computer.  For example, if you have Windows XP, then you may want SP2 and SP3 on CD and ready to install before you ever connect your PC to the internet.)    Since you have a dell, find the service tag on it, and use the second computer to download all the drivers for your computer onto a flash drive or CD.  Transfer the drivers and install them.  One at a time, with one or two reboots in between each one.  Make sure you install the chipset driver FIRST.  it may be called the "Intel" driver or the I/O driver.  Whatever.  It's for the Northbridge/Southbridge and there is nothing more important.      The next most important driver is the video driver because it can really cause foulups if it's not installed right.  Have you installed a new video card since you bought the computer?  If so, then don't go to dell's site, go to the manufacturer's site for the video card to get the driver.        DO NOT flash the bios at this time.  You have enough problems right now.  If there is a bios update, you can do that after you have a stable system.      After you have installed all the driver EXCEPT the network driver, install Antivirus.  Don't install the network driver or connect to the internet until you've got Antivirus on there.  Once Antivirus is on there, install the network driver, connect to the internet, and HURRY:    1.  Update the Antivirus  2.  Go to Windows Update.   (Hopefully you've updated windows some already with a CD you made with downloaded updates - or this will literally take you all day.)    The most likely cause of those freezes is a missing chipset driver.  The second most likely cause is a misconfigured video driver.  But it could also be that the bios needs to re-detect the hardware again.      So, just to be certain, turn off the computer, unplug it, open its case, and find the CMOS battery.  Remove it.  count to 60  Replace it.  Close the case, start it up and let it go through its detection and memory test routine.  You may have to hit some buttons to confirm some of the detections,so watch.      That should help you out some.  If it doesn't, you will need to take it to a repair shop.  Try to find a small business that obviously pays its workers well.  This will be evidenced by the fact that they're well dressed, not dressed casually.   Business clothes means that they have business clients who are more demanding than the everyday customer so they have a higher standard for their work.

AA10446546	If you haven't realized it, the appropriate answer to this question is either: "Yes, I do know about Java programming" or "No, I don't know about Java programming".    Anything else is not the answer to your question. Technically, it IS a question, but its phrasing is frankly quite bad (read: it is a stupid question). It is impossible for us to determine what you really want to ask. We can't know from that question whether you want help with your Java assignment, or whether you want links to learn Java language, or perhaps you have heard of this new phrase and want to know what it is.    In any of those cases, a better question would be: "How do I do this Java assignment?", "Can you give me links to learn how to program in Java?" (a request), and "What is Java?".|`|rNA6x4r2aa	Java is a programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.    The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were developed by Sun from 1995. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun made available most of their Java technologies as free software under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java and GNU Classpath.|`|JMY3qn53aa	I have heard of this "java" thing...

Java allows the curly braces of "if" statement to be omitted if the if statement only have a single command.    e.g.    if (foo == "bar")  ____dofoo();    but this code wouldn't work like you expect it to be:    if (foo == "bar")   ____dofooone();  ____dofootwo();    that code is understood by the Java compiler as this:    if (foo == "bar")  ____dofoone();  dofootwo();    to have multiple statements, use the curly braces:    if (foo == "bar") {  ____dofooone();  ____dofootwo();  }

hunbPOWHaa	wikipedia.com|`|esYTfoYraa	Musical Instrument Digital Interface,|`|rNA6x4r2aa	MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface, IPA: /?m?di/) is an industry-standard protocol defined in 1982[1] that enables electronic musical instruments such as keyboard controllers, computers, and other electronic equipment to communicate, control, and synchronize with each other. MIDI allows computers, synthesizers, MIDI controllers, sound cards, samplers and drum machines to control one another, and to exchange system data (acting as a raw data encapsulation method for sysex commands). MIDI does not transmit an audio signal or media  it transmits "event messages" such as the pitch and intensity of musical notes to play, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues, and clock signals to set the tempo. As an electronic protocol, it is notable for its widespread adoption throughout the industry.|`|LClopaGtaa	Read all about it, http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-midi.htm

They may be asking you to fraudulently click links and answers surveys so they get paid per click. They normally set minimum limits to earnings before they pay. And if you do not reach these limits within specific times, you go back to the beginning with no payment. I would not be prepared to even attempt to look any further at the site, once they have your information it is impossible to get it away from them and any associated companies.

c608737f97ddda0ba23407e9d4f26354aa	HTTP cookies', more commonly referred to as Web cookies, tracking cookies or just cookies, are parcels of text sent by a server to a Web client (usually a browser) and then sent back unchanged by the client each time it accesses that server. HTTP cookies are used for authenticating, session tracking (state maintenance), and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences or the contents of their electronic shopping carts. The term "cookie" is derived from "magic cookie," a well-known concept in UNIX computing which inspired both the idea and the name of HTTP cookies.    Because they can be used for tracking browsing behavior, cookies have been of concern for Internet privacy. As a result, they have been subject to legislation in various countries such as the United States, as well as the European Union. Cookies have also been criticized because the identification of users they provide is not always accurate and because they could potentially be a target of network attackers. Some alternatives to cookies exist, but each has its own uses, advantages, and drawbacks.    Cookies are also subject to a number of misconceptions, mostly based on the erroneous notion that they are computer programs. In fact, cookies are simple pieces of data unable to perform any operation by themselves.

It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or India. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.    Dont trust any cheap service, many of them dont allow you to have full control on your domain name. If youre going to buy domain names, http://www.goldpuma.com  is the lowest cost service which is full-featured and really works for you ($9.99 /year). They offer free extras with every domain name:    Quick Blogcast  Hosting with Web site builder  Personalized Email Account  Starter Web Page For Sale/ Parked Page  Domain Forwarding  Domain Masking  100-Pack Email Forwarding  Total DNS Control  Change of Registration  Status Alerts  Domain Locking      As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Computers use these little bits, which are composed of ones and zeros, to do things and talk to other computers.  All your files, for instance, are kept in the computer as binary files and translated into words and pictures by the software (which is also ones and zeros).  This two number system, is called a "binary number system" since it has only two numbers in it.  The decimal number system in contrast has ten unique digits, zero through nine.    But although computer data and file size is normally measured in binary code using the binary number system (counted by factors of two 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc), the prefixes for the multiples are based on the metric system!  The nearest binary number to 1,000 is 2^10 or 1,024; thus 1,024 bytes was named a Kilobyte.  So, although a metric "kilo" equals 1,000 (e.g. one kilogram = 1,000 grams), a binary "Kilo" equals 1,024 (e.g. one Kilobyte = 1,024 bytes).  Not surprisingly, this has led to a great deal of confusion.  Hope this helps.

I don't think so.  It seems that you did not give your processor information. Crysis takes alot of processor power as well. Their "recommended setting" is enough.  Your ram and hard drive is fine.  Now the video card:  This is one problem with their "recommended setting". They say you need 256Mb video card, but you usually need much more than that to play Crysis. Dude, ATI Radeon 2600? To play Crysis on "Ultra High" with all the bells and whistles you need REALLY high end graphic card, something like GeForce 8800GTX Ultra (oh, and Crysis is just geared toward nvidia, so nvidia cards work better than ATI for Crysis). My computer has 8800GS (or 9600GSO) and it's playable with settings between medium and high. Having DirectX 10 support does not mean that it will play Crysis well.  I suggest you to get Crysis Warhead, which has much improved CryEngine 2 that makes the game faster and look better. I can push my computer to high-very high in it.    Summary: You need a better graphic card and pretty good processor. If you can't, stick with medium-high settings.

That's called increasing VCore and yes, it does increase your computer's power consumption.    Unfortunately, however, your computer has a power supply which can only convert so much electricity for your parts. You do not have an unlimited amount of energy at your disposal. I would say your power supply is not powerful enough for your rig. The power off would be a sign that you're tripping your power supply's over-current protection and it's shutting down to reduce the risk of a fire or burning out the transformers within.

2afVnStxaa	There is a 32 and a 64 Bit XP Operating system and there is also a 32 and a 64 Bit Vista Operating system. You can check your computers OS and see if it is 32 or 64 bit. But if you bought an XP system it is most likely a 32 bit, and if you recently bought a newer system with vista on it it should have said Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bit (this is an example) if it is a 64 bit OS. Hope this helps.

wWT5yBgnaa	to me, it sounds like you have a harddrive issue    You're harddrive is physically a metal magnetic disk that spins really fast (usually 7200 RPM). At 5 years of running, i would say its starting to wear down.    From what i can see in your description, You're getting page lag and is having sporratic freezing. This to me, is a sign of physical hard drive damage. Once you start running the system restore, it's basically reading all the backup files on your harddrive and formating your harddrive. This means the harddrive has to work harder, and because it's already worn out, working harder simply screws it up even more.     Also the "louder sounds" would be the harddrive scraping or the ball bearings on the platter wearing out. Another symptom of harddrive failure.    My advice: back up your files while you still can. Then go out and buy yourself a new IDE harddrive (i'm assuming your harddrive is IDE due to the age). Chuck your old harddrive out the window ;). it's pretty much done anyways.|`|b5ySK6SGaa	I don't think your problems are overheating. Possibly just old computer. You could possibly have a virus which is causing your troubles try running a up-to-date virus scan.    You might also have to just re-format the computer. Which will send it back to factory condition, but you'll lose all your files saved. Re-formatting is the best option as it allows you to start over with a clean system. System restore should be only used for short draw backs.|`|AA10451115	May be Its in the wrong hands :D    Sorry :P    The Applications you are running are very heavy for your hardware to handle, I think you need to update your PC, higher processor.|`|fbiGxl2vaa	You have malware which is a type of virus my friend caught that one a couple of weeks ago, however his was much worse...

KHeR3hGIaa	Yes.      Business.com sold for $345 million dollars, but that wasn't just a domain name ...    sex.com (just the domain) recently (3 years ago) sold for somewhere between $11 and $14 million dollars!    Of course, the economy was stronger then and it would be harder to sell it at that price now, but even so, every domain that seems even remotely simple is being squatted on by somebody who wants $20k or so for it.    To make matters worse, if you do a `whois' search on a domain and find it unregistered and don't register it right away, you may find a domain squatter owning it a few hours later.  They watch the whois searches come in and often register them, hoping to sell them to you ...    They even take advantage of loopholes in the system (domain tasting) to not pay to register these domains ...    Ultimately, if you need a domain, put two or three words together until you find something that's not taken, then register it as soon as you find it's free, and you won't pay any of these outrageous costs.  And make sure you never let it expire if you don't want to pay thousands to somebody to get it back!|`|jmq2i59Jaa	nope and don't care I make my own when needed|`|FYhGTJ29aa	I paid under $20 for my site at doteasy.com; It depends on what you want it to be capable of.

JNkfnxbLaa	This is Firefox's expected (and designed) behavior. From the Mozillazine site: "For security purposes, Mozilla applications block links to local files (and directories) from remote files. This includes linking to files on your hard drive, on mapped network drives...".    Therefore, in Firefox, you aren't going to be able to "open" a Word document, the way you can do it in IE.    But there is a workaround, again suggested by the Mozillazine site: "Using an Extension...  IE Tab  The IETab extension allows you to open Firefox tabs with IE content. Since IE is able to browse local file systems, this can be used to open local links...."    As you can see, even Mozilla recommends using the IE tab functionality to open "IE" content, such as Word documents.|`|qvcZW7pxaa	firefox cannot open microsoft word documents within the browser.  so when you click the link, you have to download the .doc file and open it with word.  the html works fine, because firefox can open .html files in the browser.  try copy and pasting the content of the .doc to a .html and it will work, or just make people download the file.|`|btEpZn71aa	This has to do with how browsers handle file downloads.  IE is likely also making a copy of your document, but it will put it in a temporary folder and open it.  It sounds like Firefox is "downloading" the file to your default download location.    Since IE and Word are both made by Microsoft, it makes sense that IE would recognize a Word doc and handle it appropriately.  FireFox just treats it like any other file.|`|PeM99Xipaa	I think that's just the way Firefox works. I know if I try to open something then it has to download it first. I figure if it works the way you want in other browsers it's Firefox's fault.
