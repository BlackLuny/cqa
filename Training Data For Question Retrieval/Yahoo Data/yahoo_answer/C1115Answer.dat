258mrT2Paa	hi this happenend to me , my girlfriend dyed her hair while i was at work, blonde -to black..bit of a shock, she said she needed a change ! who am i to argue, it's still the same woman that i started with, it may not help you but i could not care if she was BALD. it's the person not the clothes/shoes/bla bla|`|EM5rQOGBaa	dependin on wot colour ,,my bf has dark hair the moment so if he bleached his hair then am afaid he would be gettin a #1 all over , ano it his hair but if there goin to look stupid your really savin them the embassment as well as you|`|XCpuUalOaa	It depends on what colour they dyed it, really. If they died their hair ginger then I would be kind of freaked out. No offence to ginger people or anything. I mean, I think girls with ginger hair are really pretty. But if it was a guy...just no.|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	depends what color; if it looks fine, then whatever <br>  but if its purple id kind of freak|`|af113de04b81b474729aa2c6d7e7fcf3aa	It's their hair, not yours. They should be able to do whatever they want to do with it. I have been married for 15 years, and my hair is about the only thing we never argue about. It's mine. Yes, he has to look at it, but I have to live with it. And keep in mind that it's just hair, it will grow back.|`|msh6LyTfaa	I'd just be like wow, what did you you do? I might be a bit unsure if I liked it, but would soon get used to it i expect. I'd still fancy them...just different colour hair isn't a big deal, unless it was really radical and/or looked horrendous, in which case they might have to be told.|`|XiKkHyuvaa	i would be happy for them. it doesnt matter if i like it or not, it matters if they like it. if it makes them happy then you should support them all the way. it might be a little bit of a shock at first, but support her all the way :)|`|5hIVsBx8aa	i would tell them what i really think but do it in a positive way. like go "oh its different" and tell them that you don't think its the best, but make sure not to hurt their feelings. remember hair you can always dye it back.|`|OJl5GO4naa	it depends.<br>  <br>  if it looked good, i would react nicely.. complimenting the color<br>  <br>  if it was funky (like, lime green or something) id be shocked.. but i wouldnt be mad or anything because its just dye and itll grow out|`|EhJlgKLAaa	well he has brown hair so unless he went darker i would be pretty mad. but i obviously wouldnt break up with him.|`|Mf7vu5Chaa	depending on colour, live and let live.|`|lBSFD5xHaa	Depends on the color they dyed it. (:|`|tVmxWsY0aa	it depends what color...<br>  it if was like neon green, blue, or pink or yellow or something i would yell at him<br>  if it was blonde, brown, black i would compliment him|`|2F8MGbbqaa	depends what it looked like tbh lol. but i wouldnt be that fussed unless it looked gross !|`|HfoK9Go7aa	....normal? it's just hair.|`|aadc56549fb798de3c0328b953407872aa	It's hardly a big deal..if it looked bad they could just dye it back.  If it looked good, then woot!|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	I hate dyed hair, it looks so unnatural. So i would not be impressed.
4ONb3yFkaa	Oh my wow,<br>  your awfully cute[:<br>  Let me rephrase that, awfully hot ;D<br>  Well, I would die it black because it will make you have that mysterious and hot look but I guess dark haired guys are my style:D<br>  But really it depends on your style, if you want to look kind of like the guy that goes to the beach, and has that sunny appeal than dye it blonde but if you want to look kinda deeper and mysterious die it black.:] whichever fits your personality.|`|DvzmpOgmaa	Maybe like a really nice chocolate brown, if you die it black and eventually change your mind about it, it would be really hard and expensive to go back lighter or blond. But blond does look gorgeous on you! maybe add lighter highlights and use the glamcolour for blonds and it would help your hair go lighter a few shades for cheep!|`|yeZn6AlPaa	if you keep your hair like that dye it black and go emo...<br>  if you dye it bright blonde, you have to do your hair more beachy like, not smooth and perfect|`|5hIVsBx8aa	go bright blonde you seem like someone who is different and edgy and nothing is more unique than bright blonde. that would look awesome.|`|Kszs6ARDaa	youll look really fake w the black<br>  i wouold personally say brown with blonde highlights would look really hot.<br>  hope i helped(:<br>  good luck!|`|Zw5pc7Kbaa	I think black would look awesome. :D|`|AA11418076	your cute (:<br>  hahaaa<br>  Black !|`|nFK6CzsFaa	yeah like either blonde or brown. not black,|`|607feef7204570ce980c69a20a043e24aa	i say blonde<br>  you're so hot btw =)|`|X1edcbRcaa	P U R P L E !!<br>  :D|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I think you should go for a light or medium brown. Black will look "fake" on you.|`|n8Q18dE6aa	black.  :)<br>  <br>    by the way...<br>   your extremally cute.  :)|`|YgVmm2Wfaa	looks good the colour it is now, lighter blonde and black will look fake as posted above. But the light brown or dark brown, like a chocolate colour will work pretty good. Also maybe auburn?|`|lBSFD5xHaa	omg definitely go for<br>  the black or for a verry verry<br>  dark brown because it would<br>  suit you well bebcause of your<br>  light skin tone.  You would<br>  look hot, it is quite popular right <br>  now :)|`|EhJlgKLAaa	well first of all you are very hott. i would say go with bright blonde|`|S3H8iczFaa	i think white hair would look nice.
OzBHZ64jaa	they have these socks in some stores that fit perfectly in flats. i have a lot of them. (:<br>  and they come in cute designs, too.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	you can buy socks like these at kohls or anyplace that sells socks:<br>  [they work very good for those kind of shoes, because they are the same shape, and don't show at all! plus they are compfortable!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.smarter.com/blogs/No%20Show%20Socks.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.smarter.com/blogs/No%20Sho...</a><br>  <br>  but they are actually sock material.|`|L0FPStGxaa	you need some that are made for shoes like that..they are not ankle socks but they are open on the top of your foot so it shows your foot not the sock... If i find a pic I will message you|`|oA066Stbaa	ankle socks are the best!|`|AA12063594	I just bought some flat sneaks also.  I would try some ankle socks. Not to thick but perfect to help add to the comfort and protect from blisters.|`|4b610e63fbdf602fbbdad68bc5a9471baa	super low rise anklets. if you want to be creative they can have a pattern on them. any color that doesn't clash with the color of your sneakers.|`|46knaNdjaa	Where is your sense of adventure people?! I have a pair like them only brown with orange flowers, and I just wear  bright neon or rainbow colors! :)|`|xxSGhywoaa	I would wear lightweight spandex nylon socks.  They are thinner and you can get them in different designs.|`|sg0m6LBRaa	ankle socks - the ones that dont show.
eL3jebRzaa	Try Ebay, they'll sell smalls...but i don't think VS sells smaller than small... sorry! Good Luck!|`|ZggXjWdxaa	you cant. i dont think they make them any smaller. and no you dont need them, you just want them. and theyre not even very cute they look kinda trashy so i honestly wouldnt worry about it. go find something cute that fits. especially if your 22, you do not need those pants
AaXl3vcCaa	prenatal vitamins for pregnant women make your hair and nails grow faster|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Time|`|kAci6Fpnaa	massage your head all over for about 15 minutes a day and use Aveda rosemary mint shampoo....it works really well for maintaining healthy hair
DlMsJPwUaa	For now get alot of basics that wont go out of style like tanks and jeans and some sweaters. Then in a few months you can go shopping for more in style stuff|`|KJMNhiDxaa	Honestly, you really shouldn't get something now if it's for next year. Things do go out of style quickly, you'll change your taste in clothes, you'll grow (or shrink!) so the clothes won't fit the same they do now.|`|OJn8QwEZaa	Skinny Jeans (Preferably Dark Wash)<br>  Straight Leg Jeans<br>  Plain Colored Ts <br>  Graphic Ts<br>  Screen Ts<br>  Tote Bag (To Carry Books From Class to Class)<br>  Or Backpack<br>  Stud Earrings<br>  Necklaces<br>  Flats<br>  Sneakers<br>  Brand Name Handbag:<br>  (Options Listed Below)<br>  <br>  - Juicy Couture<br>  - Dooney & Bourke<br>  - Coach<br>  - Louis Vuitton<br>  - Prada<br>  - Chanel<br>  <br>  And ETC.|`|c99K62CUaa	Id definely say some cute knit tops and hottt tank tops to go underneath. Also maybe some t-shirts. But that is not all you have to buy you should try to make your own style. You could buy skiiny and flare jeans. As for the summer though short shorts and tons of tank tops and flip flops|`|LGNIQ3zuaa	Dark skinny jeans.<br>  Basic tops and sweaters. Black and white.<br>  Knitwear. Jackets.<br>  Shoes.<br>  Accessories. <br>  <br>  And the rest is up to you. You can look at pictures of your favorite celebrities and get inspired.<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|vCAeQMlUaa	jeans, sweatpants, tanktops (layering), shirts (t-shirts you can do alot), and socks (ankle), oh yeah and get like sweatshirts and sweaters.|`|p4nresGGaa	Jeans are essential - get three blue pairs and a black pair at the least.<br>  <br>  Hoodies are also really useful - the zipup kind are great if you want to wear a cute top underneath, because you can leave the front open and show off your top but not freeze if it's cold. <br>  <br>  Denim goes with everything, it's great - invest in a denim miniskirt. You can wear tights, leggings or high socks with it in winter and then bare legs when it's warm outside. <br>  <br>  A white jacket and a black jacket are useful too. If you don't wanna look boring, get some colourful pins or badges to jazz them up - you can match the colours of the pins/badges to whatever outfit you're wearing that day. <br>  <br>  Get some good shoes that go with a lot of stuff. I have really cool white trainers that I've put really funky black-and-pink laces in, and I can always wear them with jeans. You can also get some black or silver dolly shoes, they'll go with a lot. Pretty strappy sandals are handy for summer (choose a colour that goes with a lot of stuff). <br>  <br>  Then get lots of tops. Long-sleeve tees, short-sleeve tees, tanks and strap-tops are all great - and you can layer them to create really unusual styles. (I love wearing bright coloured tanks or strap-tops over a plain-colour long-sleeve tee.) <br>  <br>  Accessories are really gonna be useful, though - the thing about them is that if you accessorise right every outfit can look brand new. Think noticeable earrings, chunky headbands, loads of bracelets, some simple layerable necklaces, and my all time favourite - pins and badges. <br>  <br>  I know it sounds expensive but you don't have to buy the whole year's stuff in one go. Plus most of this stuff can be worn dozens of times. The jeans, jackets and shoes especially are style staples - you could wear them every day and still look completely different.|`|FCTggSTkaa	The basics:<br>  Definitely good jeans... not necessarily pricy ones but jeans that you feel good in and look good on you! Then basic shirts, whether they're t-shirts of tank tops of v-necks... plain, solid colors. These items you'd be able to use more often and mix them up with whatever other items of clothing or accessories you may get.<br>  <br>  Then i suggest you go somewhere with a variety of clothing styles, maybe forever 21, they have all types of clothes for a pretty good price. Try different "looks" and things on and see what you find yourself interested in.|`|041cc53beefd59e6b01087d11695a417aa	a comfortable pair of jeans<br>  CUTE sneakers.  like the skechers/coach type sneakers.<br>  skinny jeans<br>  if you're allowed, jean shorts.<br>  a few pairs of capri pants, jeans or not.<br>  polo style tops<br>  graphic tees<br>  good hoodies.<br>  two or three cute flip flops<br>  i see this on every non-uniform girl: UGGS, just make wanna go UGGGGHHH. but hey.  or boots of that sort if you're somewhere cold.<br>  basic camisoles/regular camis to be seen<br>  oodles of flats<br>  a very cute fitted jacket. like a bomber jacket?<br>  <br>  basically, LAYERING is essential.<br>  ACCESSORIZE!!|`|MniavEhmaa	Lots of lightweight tees (v-neck, crew neck)<br>  Zip up hoodies<br>  Skinny/Straight leg jeans<br>  Keds or other equally cute everyday sneakers<br>  Knits (v-neck/cowl neck sweaters)<br>  CARDIGANS!!!

5jsMY4RIaa	grab the little tag underneath the sticky part and pull it.|`|xxSGhywoaa	don't put them on so tight next time.  If you put them on so that they stay on your hand but can slip off with a bit of force that's the best.  <br>  <br>  As for one that you have now:  No, you have to cut it unless you want to break your hand, and I do not recommend that.

Yerwit5Aaa	Hey! I like their look too. <br>  <br>  Ok heres how:<br>  <br>  Makeup:<br>  There is a basic dewy, pale complexion. Then there is the smokey eye, AND the red lip. Sometimes the smokey eye extends into the cat eye. <br>  For the smokey eye, <br>  <a href="http://allwomenstalk.com/tips-on-smokey-eye-look/" rel="nofollow">http://allwomenstalk.com/tips-on-smokey-...</a><br>  an easy smokey eye in 7 steps. You'll need red lipstick, bust sometimes, they do a pale glossy lip. In which case, you could dab some foundation over your lips, and then put on some clear lip gloss.<br>  * they dont do flushed cheeks<br>  * youll need some courage to pull off the smokey eye AND the red lip at the same time.<br>  <br>  Hair:<br>  Do the basic, dark layered hair, with long side-swept bangs, with subtle golden/brown highlights. Now, however, they have this thick fringe kinda thing. Im not very fond of that, I like their previous look better.<br>  <br>  Accesories:<br>  Go bling, big red beads, large hoops, neckties, studded belts, bracelets, huge sunglasses, everything over the top. On their website, they mention something about street-fashion. And thir shoes, they have these high peep-toe heels in neon colours, green, and yellow, and red. Paint your nails a bright crimson red, or jet black. Wear arm warmers, especially the striped kind, and fingerless gloves, the biker kinds.<br>  <br>  Clothes:<br>  Layered tank tops, jean jackets, short denim skirts with leggings. The basic color would be black or white, with a sudden splash of neon colour. Anything loud, leopard prints, polka dots, but remember, they dont look hippy, so it will have to be a subtle balance, keep the accesorising high and the basic apparel classy. <br>  <br>  And finally, here are some pictures:<br>  <a href="http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff226/princetongirl116/goodwitch/veronicas.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff226...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/ffximage/2006/03/31/Veronicas_060331011825996_wideweb__300x400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/ffximage/2006/0...</a><br>  <a href="http://khairilhusni.blogmas.com/files/2008/12/the-veronicas.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://khairilhusni.blogmas.com/files/20...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theveronicasfan.net/pics/Lisa-Origliasso-Photo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.theveronicasfan.net/pics/Lisa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theveronicasfan.net/pics/Jessica-Origliasso-pic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.theveronicasfan.net/pics/Jess...</a>|`|LCiY2u30aa	learn how to do "Smokey eyes"<br>  and red lipstick<br>  dye your hair black<br>  <br>  buy cool clothes<br>  (I suggest H&M)|`|vXOreO4Uaa	I like some songs.<br>  Well get some pictures of them and go shopping  for clothes like<br>  theirs and then try to do her make up..|`|Oh75DqReaa	me toooooooooooooooooooo!<br>  :DDD<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but im tired sry<br>  :/<br>  <br>  ill try tommorow<br>  xD|`|HiuZs5G5aa	i also really like one of their songs.|`|qWIha03Iaa	Look up pictures of them and try to mimic it. <br>  Experiment and see how it turns out. :)<br>  You will achieve it eventually I am sure.

OHfZFR31aa	Most agencies won't even consider you if you are under 5'11" unless you have an amazing face and body. But that is extremely rare.

72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	Wow this must be some friend if youre already planning ahead that far.. She is lucky that youre in her life... Especially when your dishin out Tiffany's Jewelry!! Haha!

I love this piece of Jewelry and wouldnt trade it for the world. : ) Excellent Choice... Diamonds arent a girls best friend... A nice piece of Jewelry is : )~ You should visit tiffany&co.com to look at jewelry selections : )<br>  <br>  Other things you could give her... are a vacation for two.. for either her and you, or her and her BF...

clZccgw6aa	Do you have Keratosis Pilaris? It's a skin disorder that looks like permanent goose bumps <a href="http://www.visualdxhealth.com/images/dx/webChild/keratosisPilaris_22404_med.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.visualdxhealth.com/images/dx/...</a> I have that also! They say it eventually clears up for the most part by the time you're 30 and the disorder is harmless, but is embarrassing.  You may also have dryness.  It comes from your skin producing too much keratin.  There isn't any way to get rid of them, but a body wash with Salicylic acid (the same thing used to treat acne) helps a great deal.  Try using it while exfoliating in the shower.  I never found loofas effective, but a scrub brush such as this one <a href="http://www.jwodcatalog.com/imgLg/7920002407174.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jwodcatalog.com/imgLg/7920002...</a> has helped me tremendously! Also, Aveeno makes for an awesome moisturizer!  If you can stand the burning sensation, Zostrix works even better, but you have to avoid getting  water on the area(s)for atleast a day after applying a small amount or the 'hot' feeling will increase.  Good luck|`|hV6h60Liaa	Exfoliate.|`|oKMOQIsoaa	you should use olay ribbons body wash.<br>  <br>  it makes my skin soooo soft...|`|NGCIZDqRaa	Hi juliana. Have you heard of the whole-nut husks.

1HJwuQhAaa	i love everyday minerals, i just got more today actually! (cant stop, addicting..) it really depends on what look you like, if you like the shiny or "dewy" look..then go for intensive, if you like a little glow or shine, go for original glow, and if you like matte, then go for matte, you can also start off with semi-matte. its not too matte or too shiny, and if it is too shiny for you, you can put on some of their finishing dust to take away any of the shine! =] <3|`|PwdBJbWjaa	i  am doctor i had exp. when i saw a patient i shocked...|`|EXdiDbTTaa	Nah man, you have to get bareminerals, it's bomb. <br>  And also it doesn't make your skin get acne, it just makes it better, and it does cover up quite well & also the concealer works good,<br>  (; <br>  So IIIII recommend bareminerals, <br>  & trust me on this (;<br>  Oh & youtube how to apply it if you are thinking about purchasing it, <3
2fd051919c045f9e45fe4e9d812c27a1aa	I'd go for the taper.  That's how I did mine, I'm at a 2 Gage (going for the 0 soon).<br>  <br>  What also helps, is a hot shower (to soften skin) and neosporin or similar as lube.<br>  <br>  Don't go too fast, as in stretching too many sizes too quickly, or skipping a size.  You could have a blow out (nasty results) and very painful. Glad you know about that!<br>  <br>  Take your time.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and when I want to wear big girly earrings, I just put in a set of hollow tube like plugs, and put the earrings through them (keeps the hole from looking saggy, like it got ripped out).  I have a set of hollow stars, that I put a pair of star shaped hoops in... I love it!  Best of both worlds!|`|d90f73d3f1b82ebf513f42c2f93d0794aa	i would use a taper. i streched mine from a 22g to a 2g in like 2 months using a taper.it was also 1/2 cartlidge. i dont think that forcing or slicing in the best way for the skin to heal or even be normal after the desired gage is reached.<br>  <br>  <br>  and its NOT perminant. mine was a 2 g and now its back to normal earring size. yeah, its been like 4 years since i had it streached but still.|`|e691c6847c94cc00bedcb6c994318aa5aa	in all honesty you can easily streach your ears without using a taper or having someone in a shop do it.  I had my ears gaged at pretty large size and have streached them myself since.<br>  <br>  *****keep in mind that the only reason i am suggesting this is due to the fact that you are streaching in VERY small increments.  If you were going straight from a 14 to an 8, I would suggest going to a professional.*****<br>  <br>  So, what you need to do is take a shower.  Make sure that the water is pretty hot.  After doing so, massage your earlobe and slide the jewelery in.  If that does not work, I would go to your closest shop.  Since you are not putting any jewelery in that is flared at the ends you should have no problem.|`|e7da15b6778e6c4822bb7397f4cf7552aa	the best thing to do is go into a piercing/tattoo shop and have your gauge altered by a professional.  next best thing would be to purchase a taper.  i have gauged myself by forcing large peices through, it can be done, but you run the risk of screwing it up bad.<br>  good luck|`|c386bb19327222c26be3710e7ce23aeeaa	A friend of mine is increasing the hole with a taper. As long as you are patient and do it gradually, and keep everything spotless and clean, you shouldn't encounter any problems.<br>  <br>  And - unfortunately - I have to say that I WISH you wouldn't do it... just like a tattoo - this is something permanent. Worse - it is in your face. I know it doesn't seem relevant now - but think of future prospects... will you be able to hide it, if you need to?<br>  <br>  Don't go too far. Its addictive.

ZGE6gh6baa	Depends on how much time you actually want to spend doing your hair. I suggest you look at drill teams/dance teams competition pictures. They do a lot of creative things with their hair when it's up. <br>  One thing I can think of is french braiding each section of your hair (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) so they can come together to form a ponytail. If done right it can last two days. There are also plenty of cute easy ways to put your hair up into a bun to make them look different from day to day, just depends on what kind of style you want.

Its up to you sorry. I cant be of help.|`|uclZT4Enaa	I think that it depends on your face shape. Do you have more of a round face?? Or a longer thin face?? I don't want to say something that might offend you but if you're like me and you have a kind of "chubby face" you might look better with some longer layers around your face.  So that it frames it. If you have more of a thinner face frame then I think that you would look excellent with longer hair. Or maybe try both. That's what I'm going to do, I'm going for short layers around my face and then long layers and longer hair in the back. But I have to wait for my hair to grow out (can't afford extensions) XD

But, don't go overly dramatic with the makeup or else it will be too much for you.  For ideas of what to do for makeup, and what makeup to use, I would say for school, go for neutral eyeshadow looks, and some mascara and eyeliner (but don't go overboard with the eyeliner so it looks like you have racoon eyes).  For special events, you should/can go a bit heavier on the makeup, maybe a light smokey eye look.  As for foundation, before you buy one, go to YouTube and search up reviews on that product, and see if it broke people out, that happens to have the same skin type as you, and if it did, I wouldn't recommend getting it.  Foundation can sometimes cause acne, and clog pores.<br>  <br>  Good luck & Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|F8moK8ytaa	13 is a fine age to start the basis of makeup wearing, perhaps start learning to apply foundation correctly and very lightly without winding up looking like a clown.

I would say that having a bit of make up on here and there is good, but don't let it mask your youth. If you have acne prone skin however, I would advise you in becoming an expert in covering that up with concealer. But at 13, I wouldn't suggest a full face of makeup.

By starting at the bottom it prevents you from damaging your hair when you start from the top and just rip all the tangles out on the way to the ends of your hair.<br>  <br>  A good technique is; if you have longer hair, gather some up like you were going to put it into a ponytail and hold the ends in the palm of your hand and brush from the bottom and work your way up.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful!! =]|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	Ha, at first I was confused, but now I understand the question. What it means, is: it's more damaging to take your brush from the top of your tangled hair and pull all the way down to the ends. Instead. You should start brushing the lower ends of your hair (from top to bottom) but in smaller motions. The idea is to get your tangles out with the least amount of damage. So, if you started from your scalp, you'd probably just work more tangles into your hair. But if you slowly get the lower tangles out and work your way  up till you can easily brush all the way down, it's healthier. Please let me know if you understand. It's really hard to explain.|`|3obZ7TTgaa	it's work for the people who have curly hair or hard and dry hair or coloring hair i will tell u why <br>  <br>  because it's hard to brush if u brush it from the top to the bottom  it will cut the hair and the brush will be stuck at the middle of the hair .<br>  <br>  but when u start from the bottom  and then u brush it from the top it will be brushed smoothly
dxMQAdndaa	Try Aveeno Active Naturals:  Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer with SPF 15. It is oil-free and noncomodegenic, which means that it won't cause acne. It should help your dry skin.|`|SAtTPpABaa	***|`|hVVoyDEvaa	Proper moisturizing of all skin types is very important, especially for combination skin. People with combination skin suffer from not only oily skin in some places, but also very dry skin in others. A common misconception is that moisturizing combination skin will make oil production worse and cause more breakouts, but that is not true. Moisturizing will help balance the skin and improve its condition.<br>  <br>  Cleanse and tone your face before applying moisture. This will help control the oil and minimize the number of breakouts that you get. If you wash your face too often, you risk making the dry areas worse. Cleanse twice a day.<br>  <br>  Make sure your hands are clean as well. Otherwise, you risk spreading bacteria all over your face that will make the oily skin more prone to breakouts.<br>  <br>  Apply a light oil-free moisturizer over your entire face, not only the dry areas. It is best to apply the moisturizer immediately after cleansing and toning to prevent water loss.<br>  <br>  Reassess your skin's needs from time to time. Changing weather, hormones and stress levels can change your skin type. <br>  <br>  When you wash your face, use warm water only. Hot water is not good for the skin on a regular basis because it will cause the oil production to increase in the oily spots and leach the moisture from the dry areas.<br>  <br>  For best results for combination skin, facial care products that you use should say hypoallergenic, oil free and fragrance free.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	There are many products on the market, all of which are very expensive.

1VdQbx3xaa	probably!!!!!!!!!|`|hVVoyDEvaa	Treat the current problems. A facial combined with microdermabrasion cleans out the pores and gets rid of most of the blackheads. It's much easier to start a blackhead treatment with a face that is mostly clear.<br>  <br>  Keep the face clean. Wash the face one to two times a day to remove oil and dirt from the face. Exfoliating scrubs also remove dead skin cells that can build up and cause blackheads. Clean the face after working out, since sweat can clog pores and lead to acne problems.<br>  <br>  Follow cleaning with a facial treatment. After drying the face, apply an astringent to tighten the pores. This helps keep dirt and oil from accumulating in the pores. Finish off with a topical lotion to moisturize and prevent the skin from drying out excessively.<br>  <br>  Be consistent. Perform the skin care routine every day or the acne will come back. Make the facial routine a priority, and stick with it every day.<br>  <br>  Refresh the face occasionally. A facial and microdermabrasion every few months gets rid of what regular cleansing misses. It also brightens the complexion and tightens the pores, leading to less future breakouts of any kind.<br>  <br>  Find a dermatologist. If the face doesn't clear up with over-the-counter remedies, speak to a dermatologist about prescription options. Sometimes stronger medicines take care of a problem that traditional remedies won't fix. There are topical and oral medications that treat acne that doesn't respond to traditional remedies.|`|AMVg2PZeaa	It is important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with a perfume-free cleanser. Do bear in mind that the skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition. Therefore, avoid washing your face many times, that too, with a strong soap. I would recommend Cetaphil and Neutrogena face washes as they are mild and good for cleaning acne-affected skin.<br>  Tea tree oil is considered to be a good anti-acne agent. Sandalwood paste and Fuller’s earth (multani mitti) are also used by some to dry out the excessive oil.

I remember in junior high school when the 6th, 7th, and some 8th graders always caked on makeup and thought it looked cool (it was terrible).<br>  Just get your parents to get you light makeup...like clear lipglos, tinted moisturizer, and maybe some mascara.

s6RYkrHlaa	Id say cut the amount of salt your using in the solution, and only apply it with a Q tip, that way your not getting it anywhere it doesnt really need to be.  Or try the LITHA method (Leave it the hell alone) and only wash it with warm water when you take a shower, thats how I heal my new piercings.|`|5GtlIYPRaa	This is a typical thing for a lot of people when they get their bellybutton peirced. It happened to me too. It's just your body healing. When you put the anti bacterial liquid soap on it, does it feel like it dries it out? I would use that oatmeal soap they sell at drugstores, it's a bar, not a liquid and it doesnt dry the skin out as badly. Use a mild lotion and that will help too. You just got it pierced less than two weeks ago and it's not fully healed, thats just your body's process of healing and getting used to it. Just keep taking care of it and it won't be a big problem. Good luck!|`|sqx2Axauaa	see a docter about

O6DbXWGqaa	Unfortunatley, I can't see the pics, but I know what nodule acne is. There are a number of things that you need to do, because nodule acne is also a form of blockage, which isn't allowing the pimple to come through. <br>  Step 1. is to use an acne-fighting facial cleanser and a soft towel to PAT dry which you need to do EVERY morning and EVERY night.<br>  Three of the most popular acne-fighting compounds are salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and triclosan. These can be found a almost any store,  I suggest using a combination of the three ingredients, like a face wash with triclosan (Noxema Triple Clean is good), and then a topical cream (at night) with benzoyl peroxide (like Clean&Clear Persa-Gel).<br>  Step 2. <br>  Because most of the time acne is genetic and is hard to keep under control when it's at your level - you need to see a doctor and get a prescription acne medication, like an antibiotic or topical cream that you apply to your skin.  <br>  There a lot of pills out there which means a little of trial and error until your skin will respond to the right one. Generally the doctor can you give you samples of 1-2 weeks worth of pills and that way you don't have to spend money on something that won't work. <br>  Step 3.<br>  It is important to make sure you shower every day, especially in the evening because bacteria, oils, and sweat from your skin get onto your sheets and then on to your skin which assist in breakouts. I suggest changing your bed sheets pretty frequently as 3 times a month and maybe every week for your pillow case. It's very important that you also start a good dose for about 3 months of Evening Primrose Oil 2x day and Zinc 1 x 50mg day to help reduce inflamation, (they are supplements specific to skin conditions and do wonders)  Drink lots of water (NO carbonated drinks of any sort), and start exercising minimum 3 x week (even if it's a good power walk for 1 hr). This will help your body flush its system naturally and prevent further breakouts because by moving, your blood will start circulating at a higher pace and that's what you want. <br>  Try and stay away from covering your face with make up, but if you need to help with your confidence, there are good mineral based make up brands out there, just make sure you do WASH your face before you go to bed at night. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps. <br>  <br>  A fantastic brand that is a paramedical brand that is specifically targeted to nodule acne is <br>  Danne Montague-King<br>  www.dannemking.com <br>  I'd recommend getting a facial there every 6-8 weeks, they do wonders and their topical cream for acne is amazing! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GAd2YDWWaa	trust me on this, try the emergency acne lotion by clinique.  i had the same problem as you.  i've been getting  a lot of those lately where it's really painful so i put the stuff on at night and in the morning.  usually after i wake up in the morning the pain is almost or completely gone and it's risen to a head.  then i apply some more morning and night and usually after 3 or 4 days its completely gone.  you should really try it.  oh and it's like $13 for a decent sized tube|`|GIlxrv7Gaa	I have been througheverything you have as well.... if your doctor didn't prescribe Differin cream, ask for it. The antibiotics didnt help me. Wash your face with Nutragena oil free wash twice a day (get the sensitive skin soap free if your skin dries out easily) and apply the cream after that. You can spot treat through the day or under your makeup. To get rid of the redness, after all the cream absorbs and its dry, apply a little visene and the redness will fade. (the redness naturally, the product doesn't cause redness). Also, controlling your oil production is key. Besides washing morning and night, apply a matte lotion all over (Biore' oil control is awesome). <br>  Do NOT use a scrub everydy, it damages your skin. Once a week for exfoliation will help clear your skin,but moisturize will the oil control or anything oil free afterwards to repair you skin. Good luck|`|bvnfrRLZaa	Try Retin-A. i used it and i worked for me. It brings up all the impurities under the skin so your skin can heal. And then your skin condition will improve.|`|e4e2626688588ecfdf6b78af1763778aaa	i used retin a and a combonation of accutane and birthcontrol and everything cleared up. accutane is a hassle(esp if your female) but it is deff worth it. find a good derm and ask them about it if they don't bring it up.|`|ecc61db4617978b57680cc139d261d1baa	Try this <a href="http://www.exposedskincare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exposedskincare.com/</a> I haven't tried it yet, but seems great.

White diamonds are transparent, so the light goes through them which makes them sparkly!|`|EevGvkUlaa	Black diamonds are certainly less ostentatious than their colorless counterparts, but the subtle sparkle they can give is appealing to people who are looking for a ring with a more modern twist to it.|`|HwlBgOEraa	I didnt know that there were black diamonds but now I know and it sounds great! From the pictures on google they look amazing, go for it.|`|iYxw4A7yaa	Black diamonds due to the Solid Color and inclusions in them, they do not have the typical fire ie. the burst of spectral colors in them. They do have a lot of white light, called brilliance in them. One thing that one has to keep in mind is that a lot of the black diamonds in the market are irradiated or treated. These are cheaper than the natural black diamonds.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Ravi K.<br>  <a href="http://www.gemsutra.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gemsutra.com</a>

W0Tdz0x2aa	Yo estoy a favor de la cirugía estética. No creo que sea necesaria, o vital, ni que debamos cambiar todo nuestro cuerpo con cirugía, pero creo que es perfecta para eliminar complejos y hacer sentir mejor a muchas persona, mujeres y también hombres.<br>  Yo creo que la cirugía estética es un adelanto más de nuestro tiempo, y como tal deberíamos utilizar este recurso cuando nos sea posible sin avergonzarnos de ello.<br>  Yo personalmente me he operado el pecho, he aumentado una una talla y media. Mido casi un metro setenta, y mi talla de pecho era apenas una 85. Se me veía un pecho peque?o, ridículo. Hacía topless porque no me sentaban ni bien los biquinis. Actualmente tengo una 90 larga, estoy perfectamente proporcionada y muy contenta, es un pecho muy natural, nadie diría que es operado, y lo volvería a hacerlo una y mil veces. Por ahora no me haría más retoques, pero dicen que esto engancha, así que más adelante.... si el bolsillo me lo permite, quién sabe!|`|6bllBDqvaa	hola opino q es una muy buena opcion para los q quieren cambiar algo d si mismo q no les gust ni los hace sentir comodos mientras tengas el dinero y el apoyo d alguien si operat q t vas a sentir mejor..esto d la cirugia no es ningun pecado ni nada al contrario es un lujo q pocas personas se pueden dar pero no por eso no t operarias o no?opino q una buena opcion.<br>  saludos de mitchel!.|`|7f91a8fb72870386c0fecd936a61c9afaa	son buenas sino c abusa d ellas.. yo me pondria una buenas LOLAS!|`|8P4jhJTbaa	bueno.. creo que las crujías estéticas son un gran avance para el ser humano y me encanta que exista ya que gracias a ella las personas que tienen algún defecto se lo pueden disimular o quitar por completo...... pero por otro lado no me gusta mucho porque hay personas que por estas arregla que arregla su cuerpo estéticamente se lo empeora pero no voy a decir que nunca me voy a hacer una operación porque es mentira y si me la llego a hacer me cambiaría las orejas.....|`|PTtGORDnaa	yo digo que NO y no estoy mintiendo..<br>  yo no me veo una chicas fea,es decir soy normal..<br>  y bueno la unica forma que pueda llegar a someterme a cirugias plasticas es si tuviera un accidente y quedara deformada..o si tuviera algo totalemte horrible,pero que sea muy feo desagradable.<br>  Creo que las persnas que se someten a cirtugias, son esas que solamente le imporat lo fisico...no esta mal, cada uno thace lo que quiere..pero desde mi punto de vistano es lindo..porque por ejemplo..yotengo una amiga que es muy linda,pero no tiene senos,absolutamente nada,y se los qeuire operar,pero para mi on es asi,..a vos si alguien te quiere te va a quere asi como sos,con tus defectos fisicos,yo creo que ese no es un motivo para operacion,peor a la vez la esposa de mi primo tiene una obsesion con sus senos, y bueno se quiere poner implantes...nose desde mi punto de vissta cada una tiene que ser tal como es..tenes panza,adelgaza,no tenes tentas.bancateaa, tenes nariz fea..seguramenteno sos la unicaaa<br>  <br>  bueno esa fue mi respuesta..un poco largaa..<br>  <br>  besos y suertee|`|eY1hYLb2aa	hola!! pues mira yo si estoy de acuerdo con las cirugias esteticas porque soy muy vanidoso y me parece muy importante que uno se vea y se sienta bien siempre y cuando estas no representen algun riesgo para tu vida. creo que lo unico que me operaria serian las bolsitas de los ojos. si estas pensando en operarte ojala que todo te salga muy bien!!!!!chao y buena suerte!|`|iwHNg1eraa	yo creo que todo vale con moderación.

xEJiDH5Taa	OK here are some step by step instructions from a pro! I hope they help!<br>  First: find out at the store what skin color you are<br>           -Look for the brand L’Oreal they have a color card that you can match you skin type to and it will give you a color for example mine is nude beige (I’m very white)     <br>           -then after finding you skin color find the foundation that is that color (foundation is the skinned color stuff that is liquid)<br>  Next: get some BROWN mascara<br>           -use the brand Great Lash it is pink and green<br>  Then: get eyeliner<br>            -you can use any company (I use Almay)<br>            -get brown<br>  Next: eye shadow<br>            -go to Almay again<br>            -they have eye shadows so match you eye color just look for you eye color and you got it sister<br>  Next:  find a blush that is subtle not to bright <br>  Next: you want some form of lip gloss<br>  Nest: makeup sponges (triangle sponges)<br>  <br>  Ok now you every thing for a natural makeup looks<br>  <br>  -just apply (with sponge) the foundation everywhere on face and down you neck a SLIGHT bit but make sure you blend it in (you don’t want a make up line<br>  -then put mascara on bottom lashes then top lashes <br>  -now on your bottom eye lid right under you lashes from one side of you eye to the other put the eye liner on its really easy<br>  -next comes you eye shadow if you look on the Almay package it says what to do<br>  -then smile and on the upper part of you cheeks (the apples are the round part of you cheeks when you smile) apply a light coating of blush<br>  -put on your lip gloss<br>  <br>  And now you got an awsome makeup stile that is natural!|`|3f3a98c8c814d05bf0b8f6412587d01caa	eyeliner.com|`|AA11330435	ok first of all you have to be exactly detail in your face like big eyes small eyes big lips little lips are you white or alitltle tan and well you first put a base like liquid or in powder then you apply your blush if you have small eyes you can add some liquid eyeliner and if oyu have small you can wear only eye shadow if u are going out to movies you can wear like a pink or beige color if you are going out to eat you can wear  a brownish color eyeshadow then your eye lash curler then you apply mascara then your eye liner i fyou have a  small eyes you can lift your eyes by adding a little bit of eyeliner on the side of your eye then you apply a lipgloss like a pink or peach color just so you wont look to old ok? good luck and try it!!!|`|qyRY6i1Zaa	well use ne type of color that would goes best for u..then if its really dark black put it on ur bottom of ur eye but NOT on ur skin but use very lightly..=]|`|SW7vaST5aa	<a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/makeup/makeup5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/make...</a><br>  <br>  try this site it should help you with everything you wanna know.<br>  i like to use cover girl clean make up (fragrence free) <br>  good luck!|`|i1Lz07Glaa	You can also go check out Dior.com, there you got some pretty nice videos showing you how to put on certain make-ups.|`|m90f7rTAaa	I prefer lining my eyes with a dark brown eyeshadow instead of an eyeliner- I think it looks a lot more natural that way.  I also think it is easier to put on.  All you need is a flat, angled brush to line your eyes with, and you don't have to be as precise as you do with an eyeliner- you can smudge the eyeshadow on a night out too.<br>  As for mascara- all you need to do is put the wand underneath your eyelashes and sweep from the base to the outer tips a couple of times, depending on how straight/thick your eyelashes may be.|`|r3v0XKUaaa	You really do want to go for the natural look,like "wow she's pretty" Not "hey look miss spender"<br>  <br>  I would recommend put some soft oil free foundation,little blush and some liquid eyeliner for a basic but pretty look.|`|5e9d50c0767d16ed3c0443f5598f7618aa	you should ask your mom to show you or someone who wear makeup, they'll give/show you a better idea on how to do it..|`|5a72ca5991727f4ec4dc1b28490007ecaa	bare essentials...its natural and perople will see SOME make-up but thats ok

C'est la carrure (largeur des épaule, ventre, ...) qui font la différence c'est plut?t pour les "petits".<br>  Les L, XL et XLL sont plus long et sont donc pour les "grands" et le nombre de X détermine la carrure. <br>  Vu que toi tu est grand et mince je pense qu'un L te conviendrait.

AA10741355	have u tried eyelash curlers? cuz i have a friend who has the same problem as u and she used curlers and it worked|`|ITiD3Yiiaa	Sometimes, too long but fine lashes look very stiff when mascara is applied on. It looks like stiff straw around the eyes. You can trim your eyelashes to a reasonable length and when you apply on mascara, it would look more normal and thicker. <br>  If you have long but thick lashes, that's great...but long and thin, I suggest you cut and thicken with mascara.|`|maugB9S3aa	OMG ok 1st thing DONT cut them long eyelashes is A BLESSING FROM GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! I would kill 4 long eyelashes! 4 the thinness just get fake eyelashes (they r pretty annoying tho i HAVE 2 wear them 4 dancing concerts) they will ake them thicker but i think u shouldnt worry about the thinness of them! Be whon u truley r, plastic surgery and fake stuff MAKES ppl fake! They look UGLAY wit all that cosmetic surgery, and eyelashes may not b as servere and permanent but still seriously ur eyelashes r 2 kill 4 girl!|`|0XsgwyBBaa	U can always apply artificial eyelashes..!!

I like them being long on top, but the lower lashes.. not so much. What I do to solve that problem is just gently pull the mascara off the very ends of my lower lashes. Like, while it's still damp right after I put it on. If you try it, just do it VERY gently. I use the my fingers and just wipe the excess on a tissue. If I take a bit too much off.. it's easy enough to put a bit more back on.  If I don't pull it off underneath... I look like I have spider eyes.. and I hate that. lol|`|HtGcDoAEaa	Try and find a mascara that thickens eyelashes, Maybelline has a few out there, and I know a lot of other companies have them too. They really work, especially Maybelline|`|IJKolaFUaa	apply castor oil daily on your lashes before going to sleep.Take care not to let it in your eyes.This will promote lash growth.Long lashes are a mark of beauty but if you dont like them then you van always have them trimmed.|`|OKvdCFkjaa	i think long eyelashes look beautiful..not scary... a lot of girls with short eyelashes dab on the mascara to make it look long..so be thankful for being blessed with long eyelashes..

3038d1a0be3dc25a0f6e888c457492ddaa	not really most shampoos might wash off some of your hair dye but not entirely.  it just slowly fades away as time goes by.  or you can buy those color hair shampoo that helps keep the color last longer|`|af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	Yes, most hair dye products wash out slowly, but not completely really fast, it's usually in your hair for a long period of time, but it washes out slowly, starting with the roots of your hair. It doesn't look very nice. It can stay shiny but makes your hair messy-looking unless you put other products in your hair. This is because putting hair dye in your hair or using a straightening or curling iron damages your hair. If you want to dye your hair and keep it a certain colour, you can use permanent dye, but it doesn't come out. So if you want it for a small amount of time, just use temporary dye.|`|2c9a3e4840d54cd520bedc15b0278732aa	My friend uses Color Pulse mousse (Loreal I think...). It claims to wash out in 10-12 shampoos but it takes her about three weeks for it to all go away. It does go back to her natural color and she keeps using it so she must like it! It has pictures on the side that show you what color your hair will be when used. Some of them are more dramatic than others. <br>  <br>  The one thing that I did notice is that it took her a few times before she mastered the coloring process. Have someone help you out if you want it to come out looking its best.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|67de5f42c6efc7599689e5a85a25e971aa	okay. umm which ones are you talikng about?<br>  theres www.colorpulseusa.com and i've tried it many times b4 and it washes out.<br>  then theres clairol/herbal essence COLORFLIRT go to <a href="http://www.clairol.com/colorflirt/usa/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.clairol.com/colorflirt/usa/in...</a><br>  ya they do wash out but if you go in chlorine alot it will wash out faster unless you use a leave-in conditioner. ya it works WELL.|`|bb723aa8a49788c90692c99cb8f17afbaa	The temporary dye worked like it's supposed to for me...<br>  Washed out quickly, no residue, hair still the same, it just added alittle tint.

I have the same hair length as you and I have side bangs and they do get in the way sometimes. I think you should get bangs more than half past the middle of your forehead and have them cut at your eyebrows and swept to the side. They may not look so good with Asian hair, but you could always do normal bangs going across your whole forehead. Get some layers because Asian hair always looks good layered. I think that the length of your hair is fine and you should keep it, unless you want to grow it longer and then it would look really cute curled or waved.|`|4064f5dc33e8a11fd3f54d7c357696a8aa	i thought this:<br>  <a href="http://www.pictures-of-hairstyles.com/photoAlbum/Asian-Hairstyles/t__Asian-Hairstyle-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pictures-of-hairstyles.com/ph...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  or this:<br>  <a href="http://hairstyles.free-beauty-tips.com/images/a3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hairstyles.free-beauty-tips.com/i...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  was cute.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could also get a bob-cut (ask beautician) with purple or blue highlights would be cool.

Go to another salon and ask for a consultation.  <br>  So you are Asian, is that suppose to give a clue as to what shape of face and other features you have?  No.  You need someone to look at you, ask about your lifestyle, etc. and recommend a cut that is flattering and one that you will be able to maintain yourself between salon visits.

My mom doesn't really want me to shave either, but she says i should start since i'm growing up. another alternative: pluck your hairs out using tweezers. i know it sounds like it hurts, but not if you do it good. it wont hurt that much.

(even if you wear it curly) because is will make your curls not frizzy. but as for the split end I would just get a trim then start using some products to keep them away.

Ok this is what I do. There are 2 different ways I do may hair:<br>  Method 1: First of all I use Fructis hair products for curly hair. I use the Shampoo and Conditioner in the shower. When I get out I apply some Leave-In Conditioner. Then, I use the mousse and tip my head upside down and start scrunching. Then apply some hairspray and blowdry with a diffuser. <br>  <br>  Method 2: Same as above except after I apply the Leave-In Conditioner, I spray the Spray Gel throughout my hair and twist my hair in small sections, almost like dreadlocks. Then spray some hairspray and diffuse. This will define your curls. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|059a7d2ed24902e72b8a632bc86fd2f6aa	K, well I have super surly hair too.<br>  Sometimes striaghtening it is nice, bit it takes like an hour, so i know how you feel.<br>  <br>  *Put in some mousse and leave in conditioner, then leave it up in a bun all day. Then, take it out at night, and give yourself a side part. You get some sexy waves, and some body.<br>  <br>  *Put in your hair product.

French braid it (or just regular braid) to the other side of your head, across the front. Tie it off, then pin it. You can do two braids if you want. Now, you can leave your hair down, or put it into a low, loose pony tail, like at the nape of your neck.<br>  <br>  * Take a section of hair from ariund your ear. Twist or braid it, going to the back of your head. Do it on the opposite side. Now pin both sections together, or tie it with a hair tie. leave your hair down, or put it in a low bun or pony tail.<br>  <br>  *When your hair is wet, brush it stright.

Seriously. Then use disinfectant spray all around your belly button.<br>  <br>  As far as the pain, you should probably take a pain reliever 10-15 minutes before you start to pierce it. On top of that, ice your entire belly button until it gets numb.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have something like a piece of cork to place under the flap of your belly button to stop the needle when you push it through so you don't get to other part of your belly button.<br>  <br>  Then just plan out where you are going to pierce it, and push it through. You HAVE to apply a lot of pressure, even though it's probably going to hurt.<br>  <br>  Make sure you clean around your entire bellybutton and the ring and twist it around a little bit for at least 2-3 months.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't switch rings until 3-4 months, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Especially when you do it at home.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, you CAN get an infection which can lead to serious complications.

W8plOsAgaa	Hi Cole.<br>  <br>  Yep you've got the right idea, yes the iconic ones are the best for reducing frizz. In my personall opinion the Phillips Treseme one is best. Im in England so we have that here, im not sure where you are but yes. You dont need to spend too much on them try to find one with at least 3 speed setting, 3 heat setting, cool blast and iconic setting. Dont dry your hair on the hottest setting this is most damaging. Use the iconic setting when your hair is over 60% dry then turn on the iconic setting. One dryed use the cool blast setting to freeze your style into place. It fine to use a hri straitener but do not overuse it, my reccomendation is only once a week if you have thin hair, thicker hair you can get away with 3 times a week for healthy hair. <br>  <br>  **Buy some heat defense product to put on your hair (Treseme makes one, so does Sunsilk) this will protect your hair while you straiten). <br>  <br>  If you dont use a styling product then put on some hair serum to protect your hair throughout the day.

IE0syRPLaa	the best thing to do, which i do all the time, is to buy large, or jumbo hair rollers, but not that big. you can either wash your hair, and then roll your hair in hair rollers, and let it dry, or you can blow dry your hair to make the top part of your hair straight, then wet the bottom part and curl that, and let it dry. <br>  <br>  if you notice that the curls are not shiny or smooth and they are very frizzy, for at least a couple of months, don't put any hair treatment or damage it, like using hot curl and straight irons. just use shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis.<br>  (I'm not saying that you do that, just a tip)<br>  <br>  but remember, curling your hair makes it seem shorter, so if u want hair long as miley cyrus's, you should grow it. it takes hair to grow half an inch a month/ 6 inches a year. if you want to try to make ur hair grow faster, brush your hair 876586785 times a day. its like a massage for you scalp and makes hair grow strong and faster.<br>  <br>  my hair is also really curly, and i used to damaga is ALOT. but i let it relax, and i brushed it like 76574685 times a day, and i didnt use any mousse, gel, flat/ curl irons, or blow dryers for 2 months, and it became more volumized, and silky, and it grew! :D so this should probably work for u 2!|`|704bc5164b23d2cf33c6313a3c15df12aa	Buy a blonde wig.|`|AA10082260	Do you mean the wig or her regular hair???|`|QJaqt3hjaa	her hair is really pretty<br>  but idk how to help youuu

B7zh8N9Jaa	You could have a lip problem known as angular cheilitis.<br>  <br>  Angular cheilitis can be treated or prevented in a number of ways depending on the cause of the problem. For example, avoiding irritating the lips by constant lip licking or lip biting are very effective prevention techniques. Using a moisturizing lip balm with UV protection when out in the sun or cold is also very important. Other activities such as thumb sucking in young children or use of a pacifier should be eliminated. If a cosmetic or certain toothpaste is triggering irritation or an allergic response then their use should be discontinued. More treatment options are outlined in the resource below.|`|1bd3a30fe0dded20441628c6b70e4daaaa	Try Vitamin E, break open a Vitamin E Capsule and rub it one the open sore.

But what  you can try is blow dry your hair our straight then you can you use a flat rod or even a curllign iron and run the rod from root to tip. after words try using a product such as sex was its made by ISO. ISO stand for inovative styling option. You dont have to use there produce you can any ones. In the old days women with curly hair use to take irons and iron their hair . The kind of iron you use on your close but I dont recamend using one of those. If worse comes to worse you can go to a salon and get you hair chemical straightend or just relaxed if you have extreem curls. but you should knowalmost no matter who ya are on a hot hummid day your hair will frizz. How ever if you have striaght hair leave your hair damp dont let it get dry if it does sprits it with water then put some mouse in it then spray on haair spray use the kind that says flexable hold. I hope that helps ya|`|ikpBwiTvaa	Maybe you should consider different hair products. I also straighten my hair before school. Also try to avoid windy areas. I know that really messes up my hair.

68P6NwNkaa	I always thought of it as the princess style.  That is what I have always called it, and I think the reason that it is in so big right now is because schoolis fixing to come back in, and people will be needing cloths that stay within the schools dressing requirements and that has been a big issue over the last few years.  This style just went out about 8 years ago but I think that some of it coming back in was the low-rise jeans peoples sides and bellies were hanging over the edge of their pants and they had to design a shirt that would kinda hide that.     And with so many stars being prego right now maternity is the style.|`|HwlBgOEraa	well, the whole mod era was all over the London Spring 2007 (maybe 2006? i mix the years up a lot) and that brought back the mindress, then it just evolved from there.

I just had a baby and it has been a blessing to find cute things to wear which hide the aftermath of being pregnant.  <br>  <br>  An easy solution to these curve inhibiting trends is to cinch it with a cute belt.  You can also try and shop at outlet stores or discount stores like Marshall's, Ross, or TJ Maxx.

O6DbXWGqaa	Step 1. is to use an acne-fighting facial cleanser and a soft towel to PAT dry which you need to do EVERY morning and EVERY night.<br>  Three of the most popular acne-fighting compounds are salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and triclosan. These can be found at almost any store, I suggest using a combination of the three ingredients, like a face wash with triclosan (Noxema Triple Clean is good), and then a topical cream (at night) with benzoyl peroxide (like Clean&Clear Persa-Gel).<br>  Step 2. <br>  Because most of the time acne is genetic and is hard to keep under control - you need to see a doctor and get a prescription acne medication, like an antibiotic or topical cream that you apply to your skin. <br>  There a lot of pills out there which means a little of trial and error until your skin will respond to the right one. Generally the doctor can you give you samples of 1-2 weeks worth of pills and that way you don't have to spend money on something that won't work. <br>  Step 3.<br>  It is important to make sure you shower every day, especially in the evening because bacteria, oils, and sweat from your skin get onto your sheets and then on to your skin which assist in breakouts. I suggest changing your bed sheets pretty frequently as 3 times a month and maybe every week for your pillow case. It's very important that you also start a good dose for about 3 months of Evening Primrose Oil 2x day and Zinc 1 x 50mg day to help reduce inflamation, (they are supplements specific to skin conditions and do wonders) Drink lots of water (NO carbonated drinks of any sort), and start exercising minimum 3 x week (even if it's a good power walk for 1 hr). This will help your body flush its system naturally and prevent further breakouts because by moving, your blood will start circulating at a higher pace and that's what you want. <br>  Try and stay away from covering your face with make up, but if you need to help with your confidence, there are good mineral based make up brands out there, just make sure you do WASH your face before you go to bed at night. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps. <br>  <br>  A fantastic brand that is a paramedical brand that is specifically targeted to all types of acne is <br>  Danne Montague-King<br>  www.dannemking.com <br>  I'd recommend getting a facial there every 6-8 weeks, they do wonders and their topical cream for acne is amazing! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10276863	you must try the nutregena blackhead pads.Fantastic!i have only used them for a week,and it has made so much difference for me.they are pre-moistion pads with a cleanser on them.it says to use once a day,but i am using them twice for a couple weeks. it says the pads clean deep and eliminate most blackheads,and keeps others from coming.one side of the pad is smooth and the other is a little bumpy.28 pads to a pkg,so they are reasonably priced. my skin is real sensitive too,but these pads don't bother me.especially as hard as i scrub!|`|EVAFzR12aa	The best thing you should do is leave them alone. <br>  You can try eating healthy meals 3 times a day & exercise atleast twice a week. Avoid eating oily foods or any type of fatty meat. <br>  <br>  Dont prick them, dont pay attention to them, Believe me. I've tried tons of products & all they do is make it worse, especially if you use it too much. Take atleast 8 to 10 hours of sleep a day & eat lots of carrots & tomatoes, because they are good for the skin. <br>  <br>  Also, you should stick to one product, for example: use a facial wash you choose & use it 3 times a day for 4 weeks. It worked for me & it can deffinitely work for you. <br>  <br>  *have a nice day*|`|o7Gwe7hcaa	arbonne international<br>  hope you try it:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arbonne.com/products/not-so-basic/skin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arbonne.com/products/not-so-b...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arbonne.com/products/beyond_basics/wash.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.arbonne.com/products/beyond_b...</a>|`|okw4GmFOaa	Get this medication!!

1dec07efdeb7db57f7f679cacf79cb9baa	Im not a guy BUT most men that i see walking around are with amazing body but TERRIBLE face(aka a buttaface)!|`|W3HQwrgBaa	I'll take the sexy body myself.|`|52CJEYwBaa	i met two girls in my mom's office two years ago. One (gorgeous and a hot girl), and the other one who's fine looking girl but small and not as sexy as the first one. But when i got along with them, i noticed that i am attracted to the not-so-gorgeous and petite one. This maybe the chemistry with the two people and not the appearance of the opposite sexes.|`|5604b401c494adebf826ee41df6bb8ffaa	It depends what kind of guy your looking for. Im a realist and appearence doesnt matter, as long as you got a good personality. I always say this, what am I gonna do with a drop dead gorgeous girl who cant do nothing in life when I can live happy with someone who's not so hot but is my backbone and is the perfect woman.|`|etWYqhRXaa	There Are More BODY Types Then  THAT!!! Im THick and Curvy... With A PRETTY FACE... I HAve A SLim Waste But a Big Behind!!! And ARound Here THats what most guys [[ Of all RaCES]] are going for...|`|rTmrcqjCaa	I personally feel that regardless of the answers you might get, from personal of experience of seeing guys' reactions to girls, (my boyfriend included), initally they always look at the body. They can't help it, b/c they are all horny bastards. If they see a hot bod, their inital reaction is "DAMN!"...most guys come around though, like if her face is really ugly, my b/f will first say: "Nah, she actually isn't that hot". Then that will lead to, "yea she really isnt that pretty but her body is BAD" (bad in a good way that is!)...but some guys will still say, that even if her face isnt cute, if it's :cute enough" then her hot bod will outweigh her ugly face.<br>  <br>  I'm kinda chubby and (not to sound conceited) but I get a lot of looks from guys all the time. It's more your confidence that a guy will notice... not to sound cliche but it's true. Sometimes i'll see guys with their girls who are smaller than me, and yet i'll still catch them giving a look here and there, b/c even when I have my "I feel horribly fat" days, I still act like i'm the sexiest one in the room and guys notice.  Plus it helps that I do have cheekbones and lips to die for! LOL, so no worries, i'm sure you wouldn't have any trouble getting a guy! Plus ,guys are scientifically inclined to be attracted to curves a bit more, b/c it's a sign of fertility! ; )|`|gL5W56i1aa	i think a woman with a pretty face is better, but i'm a girl. i think that jordin sparks is goregeous AND she is curvy, fergie is fit but i think her face is ugly.|`|hM9r39Hyaa	a girl with sexy body and hot face :)
JfVJ9tqsaa	If I had a wife, yes I sure would be.  Women are to have their hair long.  I really don't like how in Western Culture, Older women have their hair short for the most part.

It's about 3 inches long at the longest.|`|zLWIrqekaa	Depends... I like short hair when it looks good on a girl.

7GLRYV8iaa	I like the first jacket.It's cute for winter time.A nice pair a denim jeans to show off the booty & black snow boots would be so cute with it.I hate the neck of the second jacket.It would be cute without neck part of it.Plus you'd just about freeze to death in it.It looks like a jacket for a 30-40 year old.If your older go for the second one.If your younger go for the first.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	I agree with aus_riux.<br>  But I, personally, love the topshop one.<br>  It's adorable, but next one is a little to serious and grown-up for me :P|`|LWvh2g2maa	I happen to like the first one way better.

7tpAq9eWaa	OH MY GOD I love your hair wavy/natural. It looks SO good. I would suggest getting a little bit of a layer cut to enhance the curls, but except for that, just leave it wavy. It looks AMAZING. I wish I had your hair!!!!!!

Yes, that's drastic but it would look fabulous! Get it cut an inch below my chin, mid-neck. And that'd look great on you! Maybe, some light brown highlights, but the other way would be fine if you'd like to spend less! :)<br>  <br>  Oh and btw, I don't think the A-line would fit you, I'm sorry. I think its more for a heart shaped face.<br>  <br>  GL! <br>  xox|`|e2FLHEBmaa	if i were you id get layers, and dye it a different color.

A pale colour like greens and pinks put on concealer use a concealer stick because they are very strong. This gives your eyes a very matifyed look to your lids and makes the eye make up more pretty! If your having a dark or bold look go for a shade stick you can get this from mac cosmetics. This helps the eyeshadow stick to the eye lid! It also intensifies the colour.

Any lost limbs? I don't see any crooked eyes or anything. When you're looking in the mirror, I want you to think of how bad you COULD have it. You see all these survivors on TV of fires and car crashes, it seriously makes me very grateful for the body I have. <br>  I want you to look at that BEAUTIFUL smile. And those GORGEOUS almond eyes. You obviously have a cute sense of style (love the shirt), and you definitely have a bigger chest than my A-cups LOL. <br>  If you're that unsure of yourself, try some different makeup. Try doing your eyecolor differently, or just different shades. A daring new lip color is always fun.<br>  Getting new clothes always gives me a confidence boost, try going shopping with your girls and have them give advice on what you get. <br>  I really hope I helped you, good luck. :D|`|a5jNjpP9aa	yerrrr goeurgesss and everyone has those times where they feel ugly no one is perfect:)|`|zvHbWtBJaa	your very pretty and have a killer smile! : ) be happppy some girls would love to look like you|`|5ecd52a3e38827f0b59290da8be919dcaa	i think ur pretty....i have some really pretty friends and sometimes i just feel like im not needed...i just brush it off my shoulders and try not to deal with it|`|ToQ8wTxpaa	You are pretty, but you look kind of tired.

They have amazing hair straighteners. There is NO POINT in getting a million cheap ones that don't work. Just save up a little longer and get a really good one you'll be happy with for a long time. It sucks regretting a purchase!! So, just go to your hairdresser, and ask them which kind they use, then if they don't sell it, either go to a professional hair products store which they do have, or go online and look it up on ebay or wherever. And I know the feeling, my hair doesn't straighten completely either!! it really sucks.<br>  And then put a little bit of hairspray in to keep it straight. Not like a ton, because it makes your hair sticky and it's just nasty, but a thin layer to let it keep the shape.<br>  :)|`|NGFgKGeLaa	i love your new hair!!!!<br>  <br>  i would recomend a hair straightener with steam. it helps my psycho curls! |`|TKCrc6nEaa	chis usually dont work that great.  if u relly want it to be straight go for the sedu<br>  my conair works pretty good so maybe its the one u have or the way your using it<br>  anything by bedhead works relly good and chi products work great even tho theyr straightners dont work that good<br>  <br>  hope i helped :) ur hair looks relly pretty|`|ZquexESiaa	I have that style to aint it awesome CHI straighteners gosh they are expensive you should buy Remington Wet2Straight straightners they r on sale at Amazon they are BRILLIANT my hair has had the same style with them for months!!!!!! they work with wet or dry hair

OfVTAEdvaa	Apply a concealer that is one shade lighter than your foundation. Dot it on over any blemishes or under-eye circles and blend with your fingertips or a makeup sponge. If your concealer tends to cake, apply eye cream first. <br>  <br>  Step2Choose foundation that matches your skin tone exactly. Apply it in dots over the central part of your face, then blend it out with a makeup sponge or your fingertips until it covers your entire face<br>  <br>  Step3Use a loose or pressed powder to keep foundation and concealer on longer. Use pressed powder to touch up when you're away from home. <br>  <br>  Step4Do your eyebrows next. Use powdered eyebrow shadow on brows instead of pencil, which can often look unnatural. Apply it with a hard, slanted brush. <br>  <br>  Step5Choose three colors of eye shadow: light, medium and dark. Use the dark only to line your upper eyelid, in a fairly thin line along the upper lashes. Use the medium shade for the crease and the lightest shade for the area under the eyebrow. There are many variations on eye shadow application techniques <br>  <br>  Step6Apply eyeliner. Use a cake eyeliner with a damp, thin liner brush, or an eyeliner pencil, and line the lower lid below the lashes. Line only the outer two-thirds of the lower lid, or all the way across if you're trying to achieve a darker look. Line all the way across the upper lid (just above the lash line and as close to the lashes as possible), or start the line where your lashes begin. <br>  <br>  Step7Apply mascara to upper and lower lashes, in two thin coats to avoid clumpiness. Choose brown mascara if your coloring is fair; black or brown-black works well for darker coloring. Or try a colored mascara such as navy or plum for fun, but don't go too bright if you want to be taken seriously. <br>  <br>  Step8Smile to find the apples of your cheeks, and apply blush to the apples or below, whichever you prefer. If you have to blend in blush, it's too bright. <br>  <br>  Step9Choose a lipstick color that's suited to your skin tone and that's perfect for your day look. You can mix colors and textures to suit your moods and your outfits <br>  . <br>  Step10Line lips after applying lipstick, not before. That way you won't end up with a dark circle of lip liner after your lipstick has worn off. Avoid combining very dark lip liner and pale lipstick.|`|YK4H18yWaa	Concealer <br>  Foundation<br>  Eyeliner<br>  Eyeshadow<br>  Mascara<br>  Lip gloss<br>  <br>  [you want to make sure mascara is the last eye makeup you put on because you don't want to have the huge eyelashes everywhere while trying to put on eyeliner and eyeshadow!]<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped|`|TRGAOMsoaa	Eyes: Eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara.<br>  Lips: Lip liner, lipstick or lip gloss.<br>  Face: Foundation then concealer then blush/bronzer.<br>  The concealer goes after because otherwise it messes up the foundation coverage.|`|7uBGYSOMaa	Go on youtube and look up ford models.

grAAh6RJaa	American eagle just came out with a great line of silky feeling, great tasting double ended glosses.  I also like those made flavored for preteens.  they have Twinkies flavors and caramel, bubble gum and more.  Preteen glosses tend to be less sticky too.|`|ysZ0CRFnaa	Covergirl wetslicks is my favorite.|`|04d175f4fe3bf0494d5a4da33dae7b5baa	my all time favorite lip stuff is pretty unusual. i LOVE carmex! lol.AND chapstick, in cherry. =)|`|2lx31cmyaa	I work at Victoria's Secret and I've been converted from conventional non-flavored lip gloss to the Beauty Rush line... I have every flavor and I can't stop wearing them. They smell fantastic, they taste good (for lip gloss) and they're gorgeous. Also, right now they're having a 2 for $10 or 5 for $20 sale (in the stores). As far as colors go, there are glitter glosses, non-glitter glosses, and swirl glosses. My personal favorite is 'nilla fudge (smells and tastes like vanilla-fudge...seriously). If you're looking for something pretty that isn't flavored, go for the Dior Kiss glosses at Sephora. They have a high-shine formula and they look great on. Happy hunting :)|`|8LlKvSTGaa	just use vaseline before going to sleep so urlips are not chapped...lol guys actually, mi bf doesn't like me putting anything on...lol ask ur bf|`|Jjfj73tFaa	I read in CosmoGirl! that guys love flavored chapstick to kiss with because it isnt messy and it tastes good, but i love aerie kiss by american eagle, they taste super good and are only $2.50!|`|LIt0XD6Daa	I like Lip Smackers in Dr. Pepper, it's kind of like a mixture of lip balm and lip gloss. It moisturizes your lips, but still has that shine of lip gloss. I highly recommend it!|`|YbkgVpXtaa	the best tasting lip gloss definitely goes to beauty rush lipgloss it  tastes fantastic. i think it is made of pure sugar, but it's still reallyyyy good, especially pinked lemonade.
XVlOHTmUaa	hay muchos metodos para eso normalmente lo que yo hago es lavarme la cara muy seguido pero solo con agua y en la noche con un jabon neutro o un jabon zote haces espuma y lo aplicas por unos minutos solo en donde estan los barros porque te puede resecar la piel, despues vuelve a lavar y aplica una ligera capa de vitacilina es muy buena aaa y otra cosa te la lavas con agua tibia y te quitas la vitacilina al otro dia nunca te pongas vitacilina de dia porque se te quema la piel y arde... suerte!!|`|b7bfe78846f0edc2590687bbbd0daffdaa	hola<br>  mi recomendación es que tomes mucha agua, hagas ejercicio y lleves un tratamiento facial completo: lavarte la cara, exfoliarla y después hidratarla.<br>  Es muy importante que no te laves la cara con jabones agresivos (para ropa), ya que te vas a lastimar mas: la piel (que genera grasa a diario) va a generar mas, ya que le quitas toda con ese jabon.<br>  No descartes visitar a un dermatólogo.<br>  No te desesperes. <br>  Suerte|`|fVlaIDawaa	no se<br>  ve con un dermatologo<br>  ami hermano le dan lociones astringentes y se le controlo son de yves rocher

Luego te aplicas la sombra de ojos negra solamente en el pàrpado  movil.<br>  Luego te pasas el làpiz negro en la union del pàrpado y las pesta?as. Lo pasas tb por la parte de abajo del ojo, tanto por dentro como por fuera. Despues, con el pincel de esponja, difuminas la parte de abajo que has pintado con el lapiz negro para que quede un efecto como "ahumado".<br>  Lo ultimo es que te pongas mucho rimmel (mascara de pesta?as), sobre todo en el parpado de arriba. Si lo vas a aplicar tb en el de abajo, que sea una màscara "waterproof", es decir, resistete al agua, porque si no, al reirte mucho, al sudar, etc.. te quedaran chorretones.<br>  <br>  Espero no haberte liado mucho... jeje<br>  <br>  Un besin!|`|KY24EISmaa	no aporto nada nuevo, pero bueno.<br>  <br>  imprescindible:<br>  <br>  -lapiz de ojos negro<br>  -sombra de ojos negro y si tienes un tono plateado le darás brillo también<br>  -rimmel negro<br>  <br>  1-limpias e hidratas la piel -sobretodo limpia!<br>  2-con el lapiz de ojos empiezas delineando por el párpado de arriba y luego el de abajo<br>  3-con la sombra de ojos empiezas con un tono más oscuro más cerca de las pesta?as y vas difuminando, escalando el color a más claro hacia las cejas.<br>  4-en el párpado de abajo pon sombra no tan oscura, mucho más difuminada<br>  4b-ahora si quieres puedes ponerle el tono plateado para darle brillo -si la sombra que has usado era negra-mate te lo recomiendo.<br>  5- aplica el rimmel<br>  <br>  espero que te sirva|`|QinhhFmCaa	Pues a toda mujer le queda bien pero no mucho solo un poco pero bastante oscuro para que haga resaltar mas los ojos...espero que te ayude...
5fe9a2888a662ca3404f3e64b4cd0dc9aa	Diego, lo que te digo es algo más que un truco, es algo probado, comé mucha zanahoria y vegetales. La zanahoria posee betacaroteno (pro vitamina A) entonces eso hará que tu piel se broncee mucho más fácil y tendrás una excelente hidratación.<br>  Obviamente usá bronceador, hay uno de Hawaian Tropic que creo se llama para bronceado caribe, el líquido y viene en spray, superfácil de aplicar y te deja super morenito.<br>  Sl2|`|3d325475e542ac5712143c84d6b6a42faa	Un buen protector solar te ayuda.|`|X6TqntYMaa	hola!!! pues yo te voy a decir dos cosas..yo todos los a?os lo uso...te pones tomar el sol sobre las 12 hasta las 3 o asin k es cuando mas se pega el sol y t echas aceite de oliva..te vas a poner negroo..pero tienes k estas unas pokas de oras al sol aunke descanses en algunos ratos pero tienes k estar tiempo y ir echandote aceita a cada rato...y otra cosa k tambien se pega el sol es con la cocacola..pero lo delaceite es lo que yo siemrpe me echo..pruebalo ya veras los resultados el primer dia!!!surtee|`|b7bfe78846f0edc2590687bbbd0daffdaa	coincido que la zanahoria....<br>  <br>  Además te recomiendo que tomes mucha agua antes, durante y después de cuando te broncees.

5fe9a2888a662ca3404f3e64b4cd0dc9aa	Mirá Karen, de forma casera podés cuidarte mucho sin necesidad de recurrir a comprar productos.<br>  Para tener las manos suaves, nada mejor que hacerte a diario un masaje con crema mezclada con azúcar y limón, te frotás bien ambas manos y frotate cada u?a. Luego te enjuagás y te ponés crema. Respecto a las u?as, usá colores suaves los rojos intensos suelen mancharte las u?as.<br>  Usá antes de pintarlas base de porcelana para emparejar el nivel de las u?as, y luego ponete un esmalte suave.<br>  Respecto a tu rostro, hacete exfoliaciones semanales con crema azúcar, te lo aplicás sobre la cara humedecida y luego te frotás suavemente con una esponjita vegetal. Lo retirás con agua y luego te ponés una mascarilla de miel pura, te la aplicás con un pincelito (no en el contorno de ojos)y te tomás un descanso de 20 o 30 minutos. Luego la retirás con agua.<br>  Eso sí, luego aplicate crema humectante en todo el rostro y usá cremas específicas para contorno de ojos.

The cheaper ones tend to look sort of funky because they're synthetic (those are the ones you see in Claire's and stuff), but you can get real human hair ones from your local salon, and those look just fine. You can even get them in fun colors! :)|`|1KfbgBupaa	Hair length is determined by genetics; there will be a point past which your hair just won't go.  Hair grows at about 1/2 inch per month so the best thing is just be patient.  Keep your hair healthy and undamaged; this might mean for your particular hair it won't get as long as you'd like but you'll never know until you try.|`|k22sOk2Raa	No idea how this happened, but for health reasons I started taking salt baths, plunging my whole body in the water only leaving my face out.

You could get those Halloween hair spray cans to spray on some colors, but those only last a day or so. Colors that come in the boxes won't help you much, as you're already too dark for them to show up. You'll need to bleach your hair. Try doing it in stages, that might help the amount of damage you to do your hair.|`|IxtljX8Uaa	either sun bleach it or use a lot of lightning gel

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Your face shape might not be ideal for "emo" bangs, but you can sure give it a shot. Even if it's not "ideal," if you like it - go with it! As for your hair, thin or thick can be both fine. Just make sure it's straight. If you have a bit of wave, flatten it down using a flat iron. You can get cheap ones at Target or Walgreen's or wherever.<br>  <br>  As for those kinds of bangs, you won't want to just make a regular side part. Pick a point on the side of your head, pretty far back. Comb diagonally across your head, and voila - instabangs!<br>  <br>  Brunette/black hair should look just fine. If you want to spice it up a bit, bleach the top layers of your hair, or add a shock of some neon color through your bangs.

bWTNXVS0aa	I would use them at different times of the day.  The natural glow seems to kind of go away on me after awhile. I think of it as more of a very light self tanner than a moisturizer.

They are two diffrent products that does two diffrent things but if you see anything strange happening to your skin then you should stop using them together.
nCRccmOjaa	Take a strip of your hair and put it in the curling iron, under the little clippy thingy, and roll it up towards you head. Wait for a couple seconds, unroll it loosely. You would use it the same as any other curling iron|`|TxyRAjXBaa	its just a normal curling iron.. use it like you would any other curling iron.
b0gTS24Uaa	ive dyed my hair so many times and always do it myself. Just make sure you cover all the hair and look on the box to see the color it should turn your hair depending on the color you have it now...it is possible that it may look blotchy but mine was always good....goodluck|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Since it's darker, I'm sure that would work just fine. If you want to be sure you don't have tainted results, bleach your hair to get all the previous color from it, then dye your hair brown.|`|1d2e4507a3a250b21fea8e3930dba871aa	Darker hair color always covers light colors. If you use a brown similar to what your natural color is, you may have a slight variation when your hair grows out, but not enough to really notice. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ps. for best results in blonde color, don't use box dye. If you have a Sally's or something similar near you, get their advice as what color to use. It'll turn out closer to what you want.|`|pZlOMa3maa	Yes, it is much easier to color over blonde hair when you are going darker. <br>  The only thing to be careful of, depending on how light your hair is right now, is what the color will turn out like. <br>  Get a color with a little bit of warmth in it, so that the brown doesn't come out muddy looking. <br>  But other than that, you are perfectly fine to color over it.<br>  p.s. It probably didn't go back to your original color after the 6 weeks because it was lightened to blonde. Lightening it removes pigment(color) from your hair, so the only way to get color back in your hair is to add color.|`|JIYzLIwWaa	Its okay, I think every brunette at one time has tried to box color her hair blonde! lol! Best advice...1.) Don't box color. 2.) Go to a professional stat!  Box colors contain metallic salts that cause split ends and breakage every time they get heated up (curling irons, blow dryers, ECT.) This will never wash out. It has to be cut out. Even if the box says 30 washes...the salts won’t. The color will fade but the chemicals are still there. And since im assuming you use to have brown hair the blonde coloring is made with bleach or a high developer. So it will never fade back to brown. Yes it’s okay to color over it, but keep in mind if you use box color you’re adding more salts which is causing more damage. To keep you hair in good & healthy condition you really need to go to a professional stylist. They can formulate a color mixture to balance out the warm (probably orange) tones that the box color brought out in your hair. With doing it yourself you run the risk of becoming a "hot head". This means that you won't go back to your normal/ natural brown color; it will have an orange/red tent to the brown. Also by going to a stylist they can give you a proten treat meant to help fill the cuticle that’s been stretched and damaged by the salts and box color. This will help in repairing your hair and help hold the brown color so that it doesn't fade and you end up with your bleached hair color again. Box color is mixed for "everyone"...only it’s not going to be as great as the box shows on everyone. That’s why it’s worth your money to have someone mix your color just for you! Good luck!
Pxn0bIlAaa	Don't worry too much, your shampoo and conditioner and other treatments you've used on your hair aren't what cause your hair to stop growing.  What you should first look for is the way the hair grows amongst your family and whose hair type you best associate with. That way you can begin to find your best cause of action.<br>  <br>  You also may want to look into your diet, you may be lacking sufficient vitamins and minerals that will help promote healthy hair and and nail growth.  There are vitamins you can take like fish oil and omega 3 and 6's that encourage stronger, shinier hair and nails.<br>  <br>  The degree of hotness you shower in also doesn't affect your hair growth, it affects the folacle and shaft of the hair and not necessarily in a bad way. <br>  <br>  But if you are really, really concerned, consult your doctor or dermatologist, even a hair dresser for tips or supplements you can take to stimulate hair growth.  |`|EPeG2yXqaa	your hair is not growing because it has breakage at the bottom, your hair is still growing just breaking at the bottom, it is crucial to get a trim every month, whether you think your hair will be shorter or not, you'll see results more quickly then letting it just sit there and break off (:<br>  <br>  <br>  split ends suck|`|m47P5Jguaa	Your hair follicles go dormant in a set pattern. They grow for a while and then they stop and recouperate. When a follicle stops like that the strand of hair it was growing falls out. So it may be that you just have follicles that go into recoup often and your hair will never be that long because the strands shed before they get that length. There isn't anything you can do to make it grow faster, and you sound like you are treating it well so don't fret about that. Short hair can be very chic imo. Hope I helped, and sorry I had to bear the depressing news.<br>  Edit: It isn't breakage, strands don't all break like that. Give hair credit, it is quite strong. And trims do NOT make your hair grow faster. Hair is dead. It doesn't feel that it is shorter and rush to grow longer lol.<br>  <br>  Children almost always have lush hair. Their hair follicles are fresh and work perfectly. Children also grow at a rapid rate and that includes the hair. Also, body proportions are much different on a child than an adult. Your hair could have been the length it is now, but have gone all the way down your back because you were so small.|`|7tpAq9eWaa	It sounds like your hair has split ends, meaning even though it grows, it just breaks off at the bottom again. I suggest getting a trim - I know it's really annoying to cut your hair when you actually want it long, but this way, it won't break at the bottom. There are shampoos (from Pro-V as well) which can reduce split ends, so I would suggest getting a trim and then using this shampoo. Also, don't take very hot showers, as it gets rid of a natural grease layer on your hair which protects it. Also, your hair gets greasier easier when its not greasy (sounds weird I know) because dirt & fat stay on the hair. Also it's less shiny. Basically, I would suggest taking showers at a lower temperature - not freezing, but maybe about body temperature - meaning its slightly warmer than your skin and feels comfortable. Hope this helped! :] Also when you get it cut, get it cut one length around the bottom and don't go for the choppy layer look, because this makes your hair thinner. If you want it longer, just cut it all straight - might look boring in the mean time, but itll look great when its long! :]

kDoomsJoaa	Hiya<br>  Its all down to how moisturised your skin is. Usually the reason your skin is soaking in your foundation is because it is wanting the moisture from your foundation. Make sure you use a light moisuriser before you apply your foundation as this will keep your skin nice and moisturised and it wont try and drink your foundation. Same goes if you only use a tinted moisturiser, you still need mouisturiser underneath even though it is a tinted mouisturiser (some people think you dont). <br>  <br>  Also make sure you are using the right foundation as if you are using the wrong foundation you can dry out your skin or make it really oily. <br>  There are some really good brands out there: <br>  If you are okay with spending a little more on your foundation then id recommend MAC. If you go to the consession which you can find in <br>  (UK):<br>  M.A.C, selfridges, harvey nichols, Fenwick, House of fraser, Harrods<br>  (U.S)<br>  Macys, Dillards, Saks, M.A.C, Nordstorm, Bloomingdales<br>  <br>  The sales assistant will help you choose a foundation that will be right for your skin type and skin shade.<br>  The foundations range from around $25 to $30 and ￡20-￡30 (the prices are not the same in both currencies for some reason)<br>  Thats if you want to spend a little more on your makeup but i dont think it matters too much as i have a mix of expensive and cheap makeup that i use all the time. <br>  Rimmel lasting finish is really good for a cheap foundation and it has a really nice finish. You can buy it from boots, superdrug & www.rimmellondon.com<br>  <br>  To make your foundation last as long as possible get a powder to put ontop of your foundation. Wether its a bronzer of a powder that is the same colour as your foundation it will just seal in your foundation and make it stay on for longer.<br>  <br>  **Make sure you always take your makeup off before you go to bed and try and cleanse tone and mouisturise twice a day. It will dramatically reduce the signs of aging when you are older and it prevents spots and blemishes. (leaving makeup on over night ages you by 5 days!!)**<br>  <br>  Hope this is some help sweetheart<br>  if you need to know anything else just email me <br>  x<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|GQjnabYvaa	use mac or dior <br>  or<br>  use a prima<br>  |`|AA11103493	Don't wear any, your skin will be in better condition as you age if you don't|`|fynzkVK4aa	It sounds as though your skin (like mine) may be a bit dry, which is why it is soaking up the foundation so quickly.  Moisturising regularly will help this a bit, but another product I found great is the vitamin C serum from the body shop, you put one pump from this on underneath your foundation, and it seems to make it stay on the surface of your skin for a lot longer.  <br>  <br>  I also use the body shop vitamin E spray after I have applied all my make up, just a short mist on my face and that seems to help anything powdery like eyeshadow or face powder stay on longer too.  I have found that these products are also really good for improving your skin generally too. <br>  <br>  Whilst they are a little bit pricey to buy to begin with, because you only use a little bit each time you use them, they last for ages.  I would really recommend you give them a try!<br>  <br>  |`|CljWnA5Taa	Before apply foundation apply a product called Matte make up base by No7 this will give a base to your foundation.<br>  You can also wear this product if you have oily skin, as well as without foundation,as it  has sunscreen already in it!|`|Gh8918f1aa	I use a primer before I apply foundation.<br>  Napoleon Primer.<br>  Make up are applied easier and last longer|`|ByWRzuuraa	I dont have a clue honey, lol.<br>  I have the same problem i guess?<br>  x|`|f7o8T5lraa	Moisturize, then wait about 5-10 minutes before applying foundation.<br>  <br>  You may also want to find a skin primer, which also helps set the skin and get it ready for the foundation.<br>  <br>  If these aren't working, you may want to find a good sheer powder that will "set" your foundation for the day.  But beware - some powders will make your face look cakey. The key is that a little will go a long way. After getting powder onto your brush, tap the brush on the side of your powder jar, letting the excess fall back in.<br>  <br>   A good powder to try: Maybelline Dream Matte Face Powder or CoverGirl Trublend Pressed Powder.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MekZHpByaa	What fondation do you use? there are certain foundations that you can get that are long lasting and they will say this Dream Matte Mousse has been said to be one of the best fondations of the year however I don't think it causes miricles aha.

(:|`|4jkDRJOpaa	you are so lucky to have natural colour in your lips, as i have the opposite problem, i have very pale lips and wish i had more colour! i would suggest using a lip colour that stays on. I use maybelline 8 hour stay on lip colour, and it really works. they have many colours , and i am sure that you will find one that you like. I wear a deep pink colour then a lighter one over the top so i get a colour somewhere in-between. a dark colour on its own looks too harsh on me as i have a pale complexion and blonde hair. don't put foundation on your lips first though as this will make your lips too greasy and that is probably why your lipstick is coming off too quickly. get the 8 hour lipstick in the shade you want, and then match up a lip liner to the lipstick. this 8 hour lipstick really does the job, and you can eat, drink, even kiss someone and it does not come off! so when you use this you wont be left with any white lines on the inside of your lips because it literally stays put all day or night! hope this helps and good luck.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Try something like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT4727&PRODUCT_ID=PROD92320" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/...</a><br>  <br>  Or maybe go for something lighter that would look like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.style.com/slideshows/fashionshows/S2008RTW/PSOM/DETAILS/00030m.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.style.com/slideshows/fashions...</a><br>  <br>  x

7tpAq9eWaa	Yes, some people change eye color from say green to blue (but only slight change in color), for example, when their eyes water. One of my friends has this, and she's 15, and I know it's not adult but at the same time I doubt it'll stop when she becomes an adult. It's just a genetic thing. And different color clothes, or haircolors, or the lighting can make your eyes look different colors, too. And obviously there's colored contact lenses!|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	Nope, I wish.

7tpAq9eWaa	I suggest make up, with red hair, I would go for green eyeshadow and also brown. What's your eye color?  Just get the attention away from your hair and onto your face. Yes, try straightening your hair, and if it works, then maybe get a layered cut. Can you be bothered to straighten your hair every morning? Otherwise, yu can save up for a bit and get a permanent straighten.<br>  Also, mix up your clothes a little bit. If you can't buy new stuff, just take belts and acessories to really make your outfits special, instead of just jeans&tshirt kind of a thing. Make cute combinations with your clothes, always works a charm.<br>  If you can go shopping, maybe ask your mom, then I suggest forever 21 or similar, because they have quite cheap clothes, and I LOVE their stuff.<br>  Another thing you can do which is completely free is to gain confidence, because it really shows. What really helps is to set goals and achieve them, because each little success makes you feel better about yourself. This way, yoi might not physically change, but everyone can still see the difference. What I would also do is to do this change over the weekend or over a time off, so that when you come back, its like POW who'se that new girl? When you do a little change one at a time nobody will notice all that much, so try on make up when nobody else will see until you perfected it, and try straightening and experiment with outfits before you will actually wear it to school, that way, you can have it all at once and everyone will be astonished and blown away.<br>  Have fun with this! :)|`|bZJmgLYZaa	if you have really curly hair and its long pull it back and put a cute accessory  in it. If not and its medium or short get one of those straighteners for 20 bucks. Make sure your hair line isnt in the middle put it on the side or something. and maybe some black eye liner just a little bit because natural beauty counts! =] good luck|`|sEGarthAaa	I got my new look, I can help you with yours. Email me at swimmergal0013@yahoo.com and explain your style and we'll go from there, but this is only if you're committed making a change, and willing to go into detail and all that.|`|qdIERV7faa	yessss...wear makeup...go shopping, do differnet styles with ur hair|`|PC6NaaD1aa	Okay start with your face experimenting different make up techniques<br>  And straightening your hair is a good idea, maybe even a new hair cut<br>  or style?<br>  Just experiment loads<br>  Have fun (:|`|KkSW6EViaa	considering you're only 13 i wouldn't suggest makeup.. try putting that off until you're older, cause once you start wearing it you won't stop. lol<br>  <br>  work on the hair, if it's frizzy i wouldn't suggest straightners. they'll just make it big & poofy.<br>  try some hot oil hair treatments, the vo5 one is really good & surprisingly cheap, like ￡3 i think.<br>  conditioner, curl boosting spray, experiment with different products to find your favorite.<br>  <br>  big curly hair looks so cool. don't dye it. work with what you have for now.<br>  <br>  Have fun :]|`|rPB6VqfOaa	well first start your own style. be unique. dont wear make up because your thirteen. but just be yourself. be funny. laugh. maybe girly? indie? start buying like hair clips or something to keep your hair back. dont straighten your hair everyday when you get that because then it will split, but use it occasionally. <br>  <br>  :)
qbJ5P99Raa	my personal favourite is loose!!!<br>  loose shadow: <br>  pros - the colour is so much intenser, easier to use wet than with pressed (when used wet, helps colour to apply more intense if its not as bright as you want ^_^), i find that it the product lasts so much longer than pressed, colour = what you get is what you see, it lasts longer on the lids in my opinion, majority of bright coloured makeup (which i love) comes in this form<br>  cons - it can be messy when your in a hurry. but thats all the bad i can think of <br>  pressed shadow: <br>  pros - great for when you're in a hurry, great to learn with if you're new to makeup, can build up the colour intensity as much as you like, majority of colours are suitable for the colour-shy person, easy to carry around, normally comes in a palette (great for when you are saving money)<br>  cons - the colour in the palette is not what you get sometimes, i hate the fact that if i swirl the brush too much there is some product wasted, most of them you have to use a white eyeliner to make the colour be the same as in the palette (which i dont like doing).<br>  personally, i press some of my loose pigments so that if i'm in a rush, i can still have the shimmer and brightness but with time to spare. |`|KgQ6DHWiaa	I prefer pressed, I always get loose pigment in the wrong places and find it harder to apply. Loose pigment, does have a better effect though, if done properly |`|4ceE9TFcaa	I prefer my eye shadow pressed, also my blush - but mineral powder I prefer loose.|`|6XIXmnIWaa	loose pigment seems to get a bit messy if u have to much on the brush and u do end up using alot more.tap the brush on the corner of the pot so that any loose pigment will fall back into that make sure you use a good base for a pigment or it will crease and look horrible.i like pressed as its not so messy and the colour goes on alot easier aswell test them out for urself though people like diffrent things|`|KKFg7pH1aa	Pressed<br>  |`|5ccpnUv6aa	pressed!!!! <- its controllable and buildable, more versatile and resilient.|`|zLwCv0uiaa	pressed for me! seems to last longer, better too!|`|wD8fWDxgaa	okay i LOVE loose pigment cuz the color goes on so much more intense.<br>  <br>  pros of loose powder: intense color goes on rly well<br>  cons: can be kinda messy and it can end up under your eyes when applying<br>  <br>  pros of pressed: cleaner application, less messy<br>  cons: color isn't as dark/bright as it appears in the palette|`|YDnBHOseaa	It depends on the look you want. I would say loose powder for evening as the colour is more dramatic and pressed for a daytime look as it is a lot more subtle and easier to use.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Pressed is so much better.<br>  Loose pigment goes everywhere!<br>  xxx|`|AA12395270	pressed!!!
2TBV1YQiaa	OOKAY SO HERES HOW I SEE IT ..... IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTA ON GWEN BUT YHU CAN WEAR IT ALL DIFFERENT WAYSZ I CHOSE TO WEAR IT  WITH A LONG TOP AND ALSO WITH A LOT OF DESIGNS OR WATEVA....... THE CHOICE OF TIGHTS YHU WEAR DIFFERS ON THE KIND YHU LIKE..... I WOULD CHOSE A COLOR TIGHT THAT MATCHES YHUR SHIRT.. AND DONT FORGET TO WEAR A CUTE SHOE ALONG WIT IT LIKE BOOTS OR EVEN SANDALS (IN THE SPRING)!!!!   ..... YOU CAN ALSO TRY A LONG SHIRT WITH LEGGINGS LIKE THIS: <a href="http://i332.photobucket.com/albums/m338/divaschoice/LongStripeShirtWNecklance2copy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i332.photobucket.com/albums/m338/...</a>           ......... I HOPE I HELPED!!|`|7tpAq9eWaa	It CAN look good.<br>  But most of the time the people fail it and it's just wrong.<br>  The shorts have to be really quite short, but not like underwear kind of a length. If that makes any sense.<br>  Also, the colors have to go well together, and be sleek and simple. If you do this with bright colors you will look like a clown.<br>  And the shoes are really important in this look. A pair of simple yet awesome high heels really works, while ugg boots or a pair of flats ruins it.<br>  It just has to work together, which is hard to define, because sometimes it works and other times it doesnt.<br>  :)|`|euysLI3Haa	hmm...i think this is a case where you really imperatively have to have the legs for it. you have to team it with exactly the right top too, something more modest, as Gwen did. it's the whole rule of revealing on one half, covering on the other.|`|PTshTOSUaa	has to be the right length, should be opaque tights and should be good, not casual though, deffinitly a dressier look|`|aQauZf5Jaa	yes some people can pull it off it really does depend on the clothes and the persons body type.personally i dont like it ....my sister wears it and she looks cute but me no i would not ever dress like that.|`|pUBH8GVjaa	all depends on the accessories and the fabric of the shorts and the length width height of the shorts.|`|OWbTI9IRaa	yea if you have shaply legs and a great bottom then yea its cool to wear if you are skinny skinny id avoid it |`|M5RCYb2jaa	only if your skinny if your fat then no.|`|BWxSSADaaa	I think there are two key aspects to pulling this off:<br>  1) Long, slim legs (and the rest of the body in good shape)<br>  2) The rest of your clothing should be elegant and grown-up.  In Gwen's case, she's not revealing too much of her upper body, and her top and footwear suggest business attire.  Her hair is also neat and styled in an elegant way, and her make up isn't too much.  That takes the shorts to another level.|`|j8YJPiC7aa	:P yucky

You bangs and the layers in front really frame your face and set off your facial bones nicely.<br>  <br>  If length is a problem, just cut your hair to be a few inches below your shoulder.<br>  <br>  Also, see if you can donate your locks to charity for those people who are unfortunate and cannot grow their own hair. |`|RlWvQWvVaa	it looks really good on you but i agree and think its time for a cut.<br>  i would do either shoulder or boob length.<br>  it wont be too short and medium lenght while still managable.<br>  |`|6b34f84498d22ed4034bea62d89afbe8aa	It looks REALLY good.<br>  I think you should cut it to where the picture ends ( don't know if that makes sense or not ).<br>  It looks really good at that length.<br>  <3|`|SfzdutHoaa	i think it would look really good at just the length it is in the picture. like to the armpits kinda. |`|Zjp91KTqaa	Yes but not 2 much just a little like a little below the shoulders.

Plus, it really compliments your face. If you cut it it will take years to grow back, you may regret it. Draw up a list of pros and cons, then decide properly. I personally wouldn't cut it, all hair is difficult to manage in some shape or form and most people's hair just won't get to that length. Keep your long hair, it looks nice.<br>  But if you really do want to cut it, consider going for something around shoulder length, possibly a little longer. Have it feathered or something to make it more interesting. If you still think its long cut it shorter and so on until your happy. Keep trimming it aswell!<br>  Styles that would suit your face -- <br>  Definitely not a bob! Perhaps straight hair and flicked at the ends. Your features are very in proportion but very small so stay away from something like a full fringe., it won't look that good. Keep your hair fairly long and perhaps choose a style that makes your hair fuller, because it will compliment your face.<br>  Good Luck! And remember to always cut longer than you actually want it so you don't end up with really short hair!|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ i would'nt cut if i were you...<^><..

O ideal é prestar aten??o em cada uma delas e escolher a que mais se adapta ao seu corpo. Veja as principais técnicas e tire suas dúvidas.<br>  <br>  Lamina: a lamina corta o pêlo na base da haste em contato com a pele. é a técnica mais indicada para os pêlos que encravam, pois faz um “peeling” mecanico suave ao removê-los. <br>  Vantagens: custam pouco, s?o práticas e n?o engrossam o pêlo.<br>  Desvantagens: os pêlos crescem muito rapidamente. Pessoas com alergia a níquel n?o podem utilizá-la.<br>  <br>  Creme depilatório: atua quimicamente sobre o pêlo, que amolece e é eliminado. Semelhante à lamina, que corta logo após a saída do pêlo da superfície. é indicado também para pessoas alérgicas ao níquel.<br>  Vantagens: pode ser feito em casa, já que n?o requer muita habilidade. é só passar o creme, deixar alguns minutos e remover com água.<br>  Desvantagens: podem causar alergia. <br>  <br>  Cera quente: aplicada sobre a superfície da pele é arrancada (com papel ou tecido), removendo o pêlo desde o bulbo. <br>  Vantagens: o pêlo demora mais para nascer, uma vez que foi arrancado completamente. Até que um novo chegue à superfície da pele passar?o de 10 a 15 dias. Por aumentar a temperatura da pele, a cera quente dilata o poro e o processo de retirada do pêlo torna-se menos doloroso.<br>  Desvantagens: a principal é a dor. Arrancar os pêlos pode ser traumático para a glandula sudorípara, gerando um processo inflamatório que pode se transformar em infec??o. Para quem tem predisposi??o a pêlo encravado, o método é contra-indicado. Outro alerta: a cera quente reutilizada em institutos especializados pode ser fonte de infec??o de pele. O ideal é usar cera que seja descartada após o uso. <br>  <br>  Cera fria: atua da mesma forma que a cera quente.<br>  Vantagens: n?o há risco de queimar a pele e já existem produtos para uso doméstico com aplica??o em papel.<br>  Desvantagens: arrancar várias vezes no mesmo local pode causar hematomas na pele. é preciso sempre fazer a aplica??o puxando contra o sentido do pêlo (mesma regra para a cera quente).<br>  <br>  Roll on: aplica fina camada de cera sobre a pele e, em seguida, um tecido sobre ela, arrancando a cera juntamente com o pêlo.<br>  Vantagens: por remover o pêlo desde a raiz, ele demora a aparecer na superfície.<br>  Desvantagens: n?o é uma boa op??o para quem tem pêlo encravado porque a forma de arrancar o pêlo obstrui o poro, traumatizando a glandula que poder inflamar e infeccionar (idem ceras).<br>  <br>  Aparelhos elétricos: como a cera, também arrancam o pêlo desde o bulbo.<br>  Vantagens: os pêlos demoram para crescer, pode ser feito em casa e n?o provoca infec??es na pele. <br>  Desvantagens: é doloroso e algumas pessoas n?o se adaptam à técnica.<br>  <br>  Laser: age por meio da emiss?o de uma luz que tem o mesmo comprimento da onda do pêlo. Assim, o laser aquece a raiz do pêlo, destruindo a matriz. Pode ser usado em qualquer tipo de pele, dependendo do tipo de laser. O laser de diodo (Light sheer) pode ser aplicado em negras e mulheres com a pele bronzeada, por exemplo. O de alexandrita, rubi e luz pulsada em peles que n?o estejam bronzeadas. Os dois primeiros, aliás, apenas em peles claras pelo risco de manchar. A indica??o é para quem tem pêlos que encravam sempre ou simplesmente já se cansou de depilar-se com freqüência.<br>  Vantagens: em médio prazo (de 6 meses a 1 ano), causa uma depila??o definitiva, restando apenas alguns fios muito finos. <br>  Desvantagens: custo, quando comparado às outras técnicas. No entanto, como permite uma depila??o definitiva, a pessoa n?o precisará depilar-<br>  <br>  espero ter ajudado!!!!!!!

lU8e0VQFaa	It's a cross between a surface piercing and an implant. There is a 'leg' (mine is actually round) that is inserted into the skin to anchor it down. And a top piece that screws into it and is the actual jewelry that is seen. It's not surgically placed, my piercer used a needle to make the pocket and then popped it in, some places will use a dermal punch (ouchie!). Some say their rejection rate is as low as 2%.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Sorry, I forget that not everyone knows this stuff :)    Microdermals are a small post with a foot on the end....I want to say they look like an upside down capital L    Here's BMEs article on them  http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Microd...    The base is inserted under the skin with a piercing needle, the post sticks up. You can change the ends on the post once they've settled down a bit. They are now being used a lot in place of surface piercings, they have a much better success rate. They can be removed with a piercing needle as well.|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	It's a piercing that is surgically inserted into your skin/bone. Kinda like a curved bar and then you can inter change the balls at the end.
lU8e0VQFaa	Healing time depends on how you have it pierced, microdermal (recommended) take about 4 months, surface bars take much much longer. Infection, while always a risk can be minimized by going to a clean shop and taking careful care of it. Pain is relative, it may hurt you more than it hurt me. With parental consent, probably 16+ without is ALWAYS be 18+.  Hip piercings do have a very high rate of rejection, it's a very high motion, high impact area that is almost constantly rubbed on by clothing. Wearing loose shirts and low cut pants will help, as will getting pieced with microdermals as they have a lower rate than surface bars. If you play a lot of sports or are extremely active I wouldn't recommend this piercing. Even once it's fully healed you must be very careful of it at all times and even a slight bump can be enough to start the rejection process.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Healing time: A year or more  Infection: Same as any piercing, take care of it and you should be fine  Pain: Yes, it will hurt more, it's a longer piercing.  You need to be 18.    Hip piercings are usually not viable long term. Very few of them actually heal and most will end up rejecting (growing out).     A better option would be to consider microdermals, they have a much better success rate. You need to be 18 for those as well.

It makes my face look really smooth.  It's true that a lot of MAC products are comedogenic (like stage makeup basically) and can clog your pores and make you break out. Luckily for me though, I have great skin and almost never break out so I can get away with all my MAC stuff.     The other key is washing your face EVERY night!
LWvh2g2maa	It's expensive stuff.  They use it to cover up tattoos too.  Foundation isn't heavy enough to cover scars or tattoos.  Here's some links.    http://www.tattoocamo.com/?gclid=CO2Ivdq...    http://www.smartcover.com/sc_concealer2....    I have never used either one.

PpfXb1Rsaa	I don't think so,<br>  If you are going to an sportive event, such as jogging or to thee gym,<br>  or even just hang out with your friends at the park,<br>  <br>  wearing bright knee high socks, would be very cute, with a skirt or shorts, like these tennis players :)<br>  <br>  other then that wearing bright knee socks with long pants, or capris,<br>  is a no, no.

SA6dCr0Laa	if your going to buy some shadows i recommend buying a good brush. a good starter brush is the 217 it picks up the color and its also good for blending.<br>  as far as shadows, i recommend:<br>  <br>  highlighter: shroom, phloof<br>  lid: any color that u like <br>  crease: depending on how much depth u want i recommend sketch, nocturnelle<br>  <br>  some of my favs are:<br>  humid<br>  vellum<br>  club<br>  aquadisiac<br>  <br>  to complete your look u dont really need a mac mascara (kinda pricey and they go bad quickly) i  recommend loreal <br>  <br>  oh dont forget the eyeliner, mac has good ones<br>  <br>  as far as cheeks and lips u can pretty much pick that out urself<br>  <br>  i dont recommend mac foundation, its too thick for my liking.|`|Y7zAtO57aa	ok this doesn't define a mac product kind but<br>  i saw this really really pretty mac in the trailer of CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC - it's a hot pink mac labtop! it was soooo pretty so i could resist not sharing it with someone who is interested in mac:)<br>   this is the trailer, look carefully, she uses a hot pink mac <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYYCSEV-i1Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYYCSEV-i...</a> <br>   oh and here is a pic:     <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9ZGWa-z-HUw/SThtNAYoPOI/AAAAAAAAAnY/2UgkUgxYqwI/s400/coasmoviestill2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9ZGWa-z-HUw/ST...</a>|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Eyeshadows: <br>  "Expensive Pink"<br>  "Carbon"<br>  "Sketch" (Looks great with Expensive Pink)<br>  "Satin Taupe"<br>  "Vanilla"<br>  "Humid"<br>  <br>  Pigments:<br>  "Pinked Mauve"<br>  "Golden Olive"<br>  "Dark Soul"<br>  <br>  Concealer:<br>  Studio Fix<br>  <br>  Eyeliner:<br>  Technakohl in "Graphblack"|`|Y5dJaZ2saa	visit the following url|`|4xkyCdAaaa	I'm guessing unlike some other answerers that as this is posted in the make-up section you are talking about MAC cosmetics! I shop there all the time and used to use the products when I was a make up artist full time. Colours of course depend on your skin and eye colours etc but I reckon a good capsule collection would be:<br>  <br>  Foundation- ask the artists in the shop they'll know exactly what is best for you!<br>  <br>  Mineralize skin finish powder is amazing especially if you don't want to use foundation everyday, just a sweep of this will even out your complexion and you won't even know its there.<br>  <br>  Mascara- Plush Lash or fibre optic are both amazing mascaras<br>  <br>  eyeshadows- depends on your colouring but 'naked lunch' is a nice shimmery base that would suit most people, if you're really pale then maybe 'dazzlelight' instead.<br>  <br>  Eye pencils- the best range of colours and textures out there, I love the shimmery ones the most. My faves are 'tarnish'- dark green 'prunella'- purple 'prussian' shimmery navy, and of course 'ebony' black.<br>  <br>  Shade sticks in shark skin and beiging are really good bases for sparkly eyeshadow<br>  <br>  Have fun! xx|`|xsHT1Vz2aa	the eyeshawdows are "very good"|`|wH9EdF7naa	it reaaaally depends on what ur looking to buy! mac has brushes, eyeshadows, lipsticks, lipglosses, bases, pencils, eyelashes, sooo much good stuff.<br>  <br>  i personally am an eyeshadow whore, so i prob would be all over the eyeshadows! especially amber lights and goldmine are staples!<br>  <br>  besides that they just released a hello kitty collection, lots of cute lil compacts and things :)|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	Mac book pro!

Lqdi9Xswaa	my artist has a $60 minimum, so even if you are just getting the outline of one small star that is the least that she will charge you.|`|ptx1SrcTaa	It depends on how much detail that you have, how long you would be "under the needle" and if you would like color or not.  It also depends on if you are going with an expert (someone who has been around for year doing this) or if it is someone who is just getting into it.  A tattoo about 4 cm should cost somewhere in the ballpark of $80US for black, $140US for color, based on an average guy with not too much detail.  Worse case scenario is $250US black and $300US color this is for tons of detail, shading and a serious/famous professional|`|lvlCJDO3aa	SOME PLACES WONT DO A TATTO THAT SMALL N EVEN IF THEY DO THEY CHARGE MINIMUM 70 DOLLARS BECAUSE OF ALL THE TOOLS THEY USE|`|VsLSJ65Paa	$50 - $65|`|z3N5mlqdaa	$35-$60|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Most places I've gone to is a minimum of $40-50 dollars.

M.A.C Liquid Eye liner- $16.50    If you want a good, but affordable liquid eyeliner, my suggestions would be:     Maybellines Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner    L'oreal Telescopic precision Liquid Eyeliner    If you want a really good Eyeliner that won't smudge at all, I would recommend buying one of the expensive one's because they tend to last longer and not smudge, but the drugstore eyeliners would be just fine.|`|A7ovwP94aa	Elf Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner is supposed to brill and does not budge.

CZw2Gpbraa	hair down to your @ss is not at all pretty, you get split ends up to your ears. If you want long hair then maybe 2-3 inches past your boobs is good like this -<br>  <a href="http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazine.com/images/long-hair-style-teen-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...</a><br>  <br>  Thats my hair length and its really nice, but if you do want hair that long your hair grows faster in warmer conditions so go out in the sun but it makes it grow slower if you're constantly blow drying, straightening or curling your hair. and your hair grows faster when your body has a lot of calcium, so things like milk, eggs and soy are really good. also protein is important|`|jez0O0bXaa	Everyone's hair grows differently, I know of people who can't grow past their shoulders. As long as your hair is healthy looking, using the right products for your hair type and keep it trimmed to avoid split ends. Try taking Biotin & Vitamin E.|`|0CuK7qL0aa	eat more of proteins..fish is best<br>  oiling of hair for at least an hour before shampoo is necessary...u can use olive oil...<br>  it takes time for hairs to grow...so be patient<br>  get ur hair trimmed from the bottom every two months this will prevent split ends and hair fall|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	Hair to your waist is very old fashioned and makes people think you come from a hick town. I would go to the shoulders or about six inches past, otherwise you look like someone without fashion sense truly.
RvXEXb5Yaa	no|`|LE7aZ2yvaa	no|`|AA12004844	yes, and most reputable places will not do it.|`|JQIztxIlaa	Don't get it pierced.|`|JdpVNgyxaa	It's not really a punishable act - it's your body and you can do what you like.  However most places require a parent to come along with you if you're under 16, and will require proof of age if you say you are over 16.    The only punishment you will get if you do it is from your parents!|`|EeC30mqJaa	is it against the law?  no, because you can do it yourself at home with a paper punch (jk - please dont use a paper punch).    however, most piercing places will require someone that is over 18 to sign waivers stating that it is okay for you to get a piercing.  They wont do it without the signatures because they dont want to get sued for alot of money when the piercing is usually less than 50$.|`|C4bB27wwaa	Yes it is you need your parent concent   and if any place you are able to get it at with out a parent most likely isnt a good place to get it periced at you should just tell your parents how bad you want it|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	It depends on what state ya live in. I know in maine its illegal until you're 18. But even so it's not like they can arrest you for piercing your body without permission.   Just make sure you get some one good to get it done and take good care of it!  I got my lip pierced when I was 14. I just had to deal with my mum... not the law, but just as bad haha!|`|PCZLwL4Qaa	nope!|`|5wzrvHymaa	It's not against the law, but in order to get your belly button pierced you have to be over 18 or with someone who is over that age.|`|aPiEDdQwaa	Yes, and any place that has enough experience to sterilize their needles won't do it until you're 15. If I were you I wouldn't, and would just wait until you were 15. You need parental consent and proof of age.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	In most places it's against the law to pierce someone at 14 without parents permission, which is why reputable piercers won't do it. Losing your license over $60 just isn't worth it.|`|fLDEHFKJaa	I think you need parental permission for piercings unless you're 18, even body piercings. You could fudge up and use a friends' parent to sign it, but I would only use that as a last resort because they'll probably ask for identification. Maybe you could wait a few years to do it. :(    B|`|ojEkgJoqaa	most states if not all it is. a reputable place would not do that.    although alot of places will which i think they shouldn't    but you need someone 18 or older to be with you    most likely your parents would be best bet.    if your mother doesn't want you to then i personally wouldn't do it  but it is up to you. against better judgement|`|ViNFT9RQaa	not against the law but a lot of places require parental permission|`|hEAuWYYjaa	well you need a parent or gaurdian to go with you but it is not against the law|`|MHvPewSmaa	YES it is.  you must be a legal adult (18 yrs old) or have your parent/guardians permission.  you cannot just have any adult as they have no rights to consent for you.  by lying about your age you could get the piercer and the business in trouble.  or if you're going through a less reputable place youre opening yourself up for infections and poorly done piercings.    wait or talk to your parents

They r known to be sad, depresed and unhappy all the time. They r kind of loony. Mostly, emo style is popular for thier typical hairstyle which has tight bangs etc.<br>  <br>  People say they cut and stuff, just cause i like to wear black people have started labelling me "EMO"...plain stupid.<br>  <br>  Silly people these EMOS are...i have heard they discuss about black parade which they believe they will attend when they die. It even caused a death of some girl named Hannah who hanged herself as a sacrifice.<br>  <br>  And there is also a trend newly started called "Scene". People say it is a happier version of EMO....they mostly wear bright clothes, big bangles, tight jeans, and have bangs (like EMOs). Ppl say they r always happy n cheerful and not always sad and depressed like emos.<br>  <br>  People's imagination runs so wild these days....|`|AA12367392	Depends on what state in australia you live in, but all of the above are still alive and kicking here, yes, we take a while to pick up on the trends, mostly just loads of tattoos and piercings on both men and women and some even still have the mullet hair cut lol! :)|`|mVUpt8waaa	I think you mean EMOs<br>  <br>  Well theres also Scenesters, Hipsters, Nu-Ravers and good old fashioned metal heads.|`|d6Dul5cSaa	Yes, EMUs are very in fashion at the moment.

hJagdJIQaa	Tips:    Foundation:   -Make sure to put everywhere on your face; not just the blemishes because it will look uneven.     Concealer: Use just a little blob on each blemish. Blend in by using your ring finger.     Eyeshadow; Make sure the color you choose matches what you wear. I mean; you wouldn't want purple eyeshadow with a yellow dress would you? Light shimmery browns will go with anything. And when you apply it never just spread it on your eyelid. Pat it; it stays on longer and gives more color. You can put some on your lower lashline to add extra color.    Eyeliner: Make sure you make a long smooth line across your eyelid. Never go just half way; it makes your eye look smaller. If you having a lazy day where you look really tired; put white eyeliner on your lower lashline. It makes you look peppy :)    Mascara: Make sure you use it root to tip. Never use too much or you'll look like a drag queen. What i do is dip the brush in mascara and then blot it with a tissue so that i don't put on too much. You can use a eye lash curler before if you want extra length. **And the secret to long lashes is warm mascara. You can heat up your mascara and it  makes most eyelashes longer and more defined. :D    Blush/Bronzer: Never just slab it on your face. Make sure you cover your brush with blush or bronzer and dab it on your wrist to warm it up. Then apply to your cheeks and put a little on your temples.    Lipstick/Lipgloss/Lipliner: Make sure your lipliner matches the color of your lipstick or gloss. And make sure not to wear lipstick if your lips are dry. If they are dry...just put some vasoline on them overnight.         I hope this helps; these are just the basics :)|`|yo0qnedIaa	Itd help if I had a photo or something to work off of.

MHvPewSmaa	first and foremost it depends on your pain tolerance.  It also depends on how and the skill of your piercer.  Some people get it pierced with a gun (which is really bad as it shreds the cartilage and the skin).    my piercing didn't hurt at all.  yes it does make your eyes water, but it doesnt hurt.  pinch your nostril and it feels less than that (in my experience). the only reason i knew the needle went through was watching the facial expressions of the people watching.    a good piercer does it so fast there is a sting and thats it.    as for it hurting afterwards as long as you take good care of it and are careful not to snag it it doesn't hurt at all.|`|Pcx3wdoWaa	i've had my ears, lip, tongue, AND nose done.  and i honestly think nose hurt the most.  but it's still worth it. just makes your eye water.|`|bttrB0Rfaa	it's gonna hurt more than having your ears done, but it's not considered one of the most painful piercings, tongue & belly button are.|`|sciO32Bsaa	Pain can't be measured by someone else we all have different tolerances.  Don't get it done by a gun, it will never heal and leave you at greater risk for infection.|`|toBMbViOaa	honestly...it hurts really bad..for like a second! only when the needle and ring is inserted does it actually hurt. then after that is all over with you are good to go..without pain or a scar!  Good Luck!|`|3amBoKJZaa	dont know never tried it|`|hneetSf2aa	it hurt like hell when i got mine done|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	Just think about how dirty it is to pierce you nose.

I did it by myself, and it didn't hurt. Just ice your nose, and if it does hurt, then it wont last for that long. Just like an ear peircing, it hurts at first, but then it's worth it in the end.|`|AA12004844	yes, it hurts and it will continue to hurt because while you sleep, wash your face, get dressed, blow your nose - anything that touches it will make you jump.    it takes a long time to heal too|`|kAci6Fpnaa	it does not really "hurt" it just feels more or less uncomfortable. ALSO it makes a popping noise that can freak you out...but it does hurt for about 3 seconds then it is over with|`|OfGSF2vmaa	Of course it will hurt.    They are taking a little needle and puncturing a hole in your skin.     Will the pain be terrible? Well, if you had ever gotten a piercing you should know.     Since it is only your nose, it isn't going to hurt THAT much but you will feel pain and possible a little pain afterward.|`|8a4c030a7a44cd4edebe25c4141c6ddaaa	Ive had my ears, tongue, belly button, labret, and nose done.  The nose is by far the most painful.  But it doesnt last a very long time.  Whats hard though is that through the healing process if you ever get hit in the nose accidently, it hurts like crazy.  So I wont lie and tell you that it isnt painful at all, but I will tell you that its completely worth it.  So I say you go for it!!
6HS1ot35aa	I have long hair as well and one of my favorite styles, is wavy hair. When you wash your hair in the shower, make sure to use conditioner. When out of the shower, DO NOT brush your hair, instead, scrunch it and let it dry for a bit. Then apply Bed Head Manipulator to your hair. First apply to your hands then scrunch it into your hair..start from the bottom and move your way up. You then take a comb and tease your hair at the roots and apply some of the product there. Once your hair is completely dry, it should have a nice, beachy wave to it :)|`|RJ6UI9bwaa	There are a few answers...<br>  <br>  1. either before u go to bed put ur hair in plaits and undo them in the morning or plait wet hair and natrually let it dry or with a hairdryer<br>  <br>  2. With a curling iron or straightner, use leave in conditioner and lightly curl your hair but not for too long other wise it will be very curly.<br>  <br>  3. curlers|`|w7m52T9Waa	hello. !! grab a curler and wrap about an inch of your hair around the barrell. let go after a few seconds, and separate with your fingers.|`|oHSsJ4Koaa	well young lady it is hard to get natural hair curly because they have been so youster having ur hair like that it stays that way.... have you tried usinh hair straightners and curling it .... or wash ur hair after you done that when you get out put some spray on ( not hairspray something like after bath spray) dry it and then use straightners to curl it and when you curl put hairspray and in the morning they look natural ... i once did it.... or if not go see a stylist

RwXTJiTMaa	I have never used it, but protein-infused products are usually pretty decent.<br>  <br>   I never spend money on anything for myself except my hair -- I have two great products that are a bit pricey, but I find that they make my curly hair comb-able and manageable more than your typical walmart buy.<br>  <br>  the first is SHRD protein cream -- this is SUPER expensive, but totally worth it.<br>  the second is joico k-pak reconstruct. also pricey, but less than the SHRD.<br>  the third, and more affordable (but hard to find) is neutrogena's triple moisture mousse.

xGmhDTWwaa	I wouldn't think so, although it could dye your skin, it should gradually come off as skin cells die and fall off. Perhaps you've tanned?? It could be possible that it's just deeply penetrated your skin I suppose. I honestly don't know. Just exfoliate regularly. xx|`|rL866v8Baa	You can't really dye your skin as cells just dye and fall off.

Just pin in some hair extensions, like you said you were going to. Your hair pretty much looks like the girl in the picture, she just has thicker bangs. I wouldn't bleach it white blonde. That's horrible. Keep it dark, I can't even picture natural blonde hair on you. Dark brown was a good choice. You're not going for the scene look, but you actually kind of are, as the girls hair in the photo is definitely considered scene. Just don't get "coon" extensions. Not attractive.|`|PvwZdLuLaa	Well you're a cute girl, but I'm really sorry I am going to have to give you some of that eew that's ugly bs. lol.

But if you don't mind that and really want to have that hair, well it's your hair. Do whatever you want, if you really, I mean REALLY want it. I wouldn't dive right into it without thinking hard about it because layers like that are a b!tch to grow out. I had hair almost ish like that a couple years ago and I'm still growing out the damn layers. I thought for sure I loved the hair, but I got sick of it and decided to have a more manageable style, but the freaking layers just get in the way. I can NOT emphasize this enough. LAYERS SUCK ***. So please reconsider it. Also, I think the hair color you have now would suit you better than white blonde. Sounds like you really want a change..maybe get it cut a tad shorter, or dye it a more subtle color than white blonde? idk. good luck though.|`|vTx6BVQDaa	you are beautiful!  So, I'm a hair stylist and I think you could totally rock the haircut you want (although you're cut now is very cute) the only thing that sucks about the cut you want is that if you decide you want less layering (because it's a LOOOT in that pic) it'll take a good while to grow them out.  Good Luck! oh! and don't go blonde....i reeeeally don't think it would look that good on you.  Highlights? go for it! : ) but not all blonde. besides it's SOOO damaging to your hair|`|shcsbtbYaa	Omg!

(:<br>  <br>  That hair would look absolutely beautiful on you, and I personally think that any hairstyle would look good on you, because you're very pretty!<br>  <br>  Your hair would look cute and unique, not have just the "something plain like everyone else" type of look. :P (Your hair isn't plain right now, it's pretty.)<br>  <br>  If you want to do that hairstyle, go for it, because I know you could pull that off easily and look stunning.(:<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|MXL0YxV2aa	You have a beautiful face, and a haircut like that would only serve to make you look cheap.<br>  Those haircuts may seem like all the rage now, but they honestly make people look very conformist.<br>  <br>  If you want a difference in your hair, I would much rather suggest dying like a reddish-brown or burgundy color, or getting a perm.<br>  <br>  Anything other than that haircut you posted.  Your face is much better than that trash.|`|5Ive0UABaa	its cute but if you get that haircut you would be ruining your hair by the straightner and teasing and products.and it looks way to messy. you look great the way you are but you will regret it if you get that hairstyle. it looks fake. just grow you hair out naturally and dont get extensions. they are bad for your hair too.|`|whFZ639Daa	ok me girl please shut thte hell up your a kid your like 11 right cause no one would make the rudest comments like you do.<br>  <br>  I think you would look so great in it and i do feel your a person that looks like a scene alot and i think scene has the best taste in ahir.<br>  I think that hair style would be great for you :D|`|OaZk8It8aa	omgshh, your adorable xD<br>  you got the perfect face for scene hair, all cute like, people with hard bitchy looking faces just look weird with it lol. extensions. i agree idk if u can get it white blonde nicely but hey just do it cuz ur one of those people who wod look amazing with it!!!|`|JJcrSGMgaa	yah i love that hair style its so retro and cute <br>  i would love for my hair to be that style my hair is long like that but its thick and i have curly hair so it would never work but u would look really cute with that stlye...<br>  <br>  <br>  its not b.s.      you are a gorgeos and pretty girl <br>  im not gonna lie to u bout it|`|PYdWer6taa	You look fine.<br>  <br>  The haircut you posted, however, is hideous.

And by the way, I think that you're very pretty! I think that it would look really great on you! You should definitely go for it! You would look really cute! Hope that helps! ;)|`|5hyrhyVhaa	I think that hair cut would look nice on you but it would take a long time to grow out. DO NOT DYE your hair blonde.

But the haircut will make you look a bit older.|`|9SSRIUPKaa	your hair is pretty!! i think you should leave your hair the way it is. my hair was like yours but then i got if cut for a hairstyle i thought i would like but soon decided that i hated my hair|`|AQHFUPSPaa	Everyone is unique.

vD7AAkUFaa	Ok you sound like a SEXBEAST already soo you probs dont have to do much. But since i deffies dont know you....napuching babeee. Ok i think a good shop to sportgirls this weekend will give you ideas what to wear. im thinking you should wear the tightnbright theme cause that sounds sooo much more sexy and more boys at your feet. Sportgirl is expensive though, but they are having a sale, Omg though there are thesse soooo hot, stocking at sportgirl right now and it would bring out the sexy beast within you. They are like black with meshy flowers on them.<br>  P.s Get some really good mascara to bring out your gorgeous eyes.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	The best option is always the LBD "little black dress"..go for what suits your shape and size and accentuates that parts you like...but only go for one like legs or cleavage. If it is themed then accessorize with themed items like a hat or feather boa for carnival and tight and bright perhaps neon bangles,glow sticks and make-up. Make your friends follow suit too..if you all look similar you wont stand out too much and it will be your little uniform for the night.|`|xtT8EPm0aa	I feel the best thing to do is find a simple fun dress and accessorize, accessorize, accessorize!  Have lots of fun, inexpensive, sparkly jewelry.  You may already own a cute little dress or borrow from a friend then add your accessories to make it all your own look.  Good luck girl!
VefSnu0Gaa	i would go with dark grey eyeliner, and grey shadow in the exterior of the eye and going to pail pink in on the other side.-<br>  lots of mascara to get great lashes.-<br>  if your shoes are black you can go with black eyeliner.-<br>  :)<br>  <br>  something like this, but if you want with a little more pink<br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/thing?id=5354193" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/thing?id=535...</a><br>  <br>  do you have a party? :)<br>  <br>  edit: fun!!|`|DB0LYUGTaa	Apply an iridescent pink eyeshadow over the eyelid.Line your upper and lower rim with a black pencil and go over the line with a black liquid liner. Remember to line all the way into the inner corners. Sweep several coats of black mascara on both the top and lower lashes. For a more dramatic effect, use false lashes on top. Finally, highlight the inner corners with a shimmery white eyeshadow to really open up the eyes.<br>  Apply a shimmery pink blush along your cheekbones.<br>  Start by lining your lips with a liner that matches your natural lip color. Top with a nude lipgloss , apply a nude lipstick,and top with a clear gloss . And Good Luck!! Hope you liked it!!|`|1xsUVtzBaa	line top of eye and extend out past lashes with silver crayon..then press into that metallic silver shadow ...extend the silver shadow to the crease of your eye..add a light shimmery pink highlighter to under your brow bone..and above the cupids bow of your lip. Black mascara on top lashes. Line inner rims with white liner. and add some silver/white shimmer powder over the lower eye lid and in the inner corners of your eyes.use a neutral dusty pink lip gloss. do a Rosy pink cheek with pink highlight powder on upper cheek bones to add Radiance.|`|xtT8EPm0aa	Go with browns.  Ever notice in your shadow compact how brown shadows typically have pinks also.... they pair them for a reason.  They look great together!!!|`|tM7Dv5m0aa	Subtle smokey eye in brown maybe.<br>  <br>  V. chic!|`|lXjv0coraa	cat eye, minimal blush, sheer pink gloss:)|`|tKTE2xxpaa	dark blue|`|spXPpyP0aa	light brown and pink on top|`|qIEhu6uxaa	I love smoky eyes so I like to go with a dark base no matter what I'm wearing.  When I wear pink I do a plum base, then pink above it and then iridescent purple on the top.  Make sure to blend it tho!  It sounds like clown make up but my mary kay consultant tought me how to apply it and it always looks bomb!|`|9QF6GGyiaa	I recommend silver eyeshadow.

VefSnu0Gaa	well, there's a lot of ways, here's some:<br>  - bright color clutch and shoes.-<br>  - a big necklace or long earrings.-<br>  - a waist-belt.-<br>  - pearls.-<br>  if i could see the dress it'd be better, can you post a link to it??<br>  :)<br>  <br>  edit : omg !! i totally take the job, haha, i loooove fashion!<br>  <br>  well, with that cleevage, i wouldn't wear a necklace, more like big earrings like hoops o big chandelier earrings.-<br>  and i'd match the earrings with the shoes and clutch.-<br>  <br>  other option could be putting a lace with a bow right under the boobs, see that the dress has a cut, and you tie the bow in the front, not in the middle, slightly to one side (any side, but i like more to the right side, hehe), the lace would have to be color, like green or purple, i love those colors with black!<br>  <br>  and if you really really want to wear a necklace it would have to be a drop necklace, that falls right in the middle of the cleavage, so it doesn't draw attention out of the cleaveage (which is what we need to make emphasis in, haha)<br>  <br>  you could also wear a headband, i'm not sure if you like them, a lot of people don't but i'm a headband freak, i'm like a blair waldorf, haha, with a bow or a flower on the side or even a simple one can work with the color lace, if you wear a headband wear simple earrings or no earrigs at all, otherwise you'll have like too much going on the head area<br>  i think with a tan, the black it's gonna look amazing on you, and also the pink one :)<br>  then show me a picture of what you wear!!!<br>  :D|`|28522d76fdc2bf2d2e1ebcafa38469dcaa	I've always thought of the "little black dress" as the matte and frame for a painting.  Your makeup, hair and accessories are the "paint."  The trick is to pick a focal point and don't overdo the whole picture.  For instance, your hair can be done up in a beautiful up-do with some small gems winking out of your hair.  Use a strong lipstick with neutral eye make-up for this.  Or you can let your make-up be the focus.  Dramatic eyes with an understated hairdo and elegant, but minimal, jewelry (like earrings and maybe a bracelet or ring).  If jewelry is your focus, go with dangling earrings, a necklace, chunky bracelet and a ring...but use muted, neutral make-up.  The idea is to highlight one aspect of your overall look and let your dress just be the backdrop.  You really can't go wrong with the LBD.|`|vPI1hVGUaa	Accessories such as belts, shawls, jewelry, purses are the best way to spice up any outfit. Also maybe try wearing metallic or brightly colored shoes instead of plain black|`|ZP4OdQGDaa	put bright belts, jewellery and shoes.<br>  So you could have a purple belt and matching shoes<br>  kinda like what the saturdays did in their video for up<br>  that kinda thing
m3ThrbDMaa	Of course...<br>  <br>  I have before...<br>  <br>  Everybody has some kind of imperfection about them, and acne never bothered me anymore than scars or stretchmarks do...<br>  <br>  (It's the smoldering look in her eyes and a sense of humor that I'm attracted to...who cares about minor imperfections of the skin...if you looked at any person's skin under a microscope, you would see what looks like a series of Grand Canyons...)|`|cmw591woaa	if i was a guy with bad acne.|`|ceps7Udvaa	what does that matter.<br>  <br>  It's whats under the acne you find attractive and her personality.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Yeah I have the same question!<br>  I get breakouts once a month (yeah :( )<br>  I just don't know how people can stand me.

7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	Whether it's for face or eyes, a little bit goes a long way. Just enough for a light layer.|`|spXPpyP0aa	um?|`|XYT7jvBdaa	For the eyes:<br>  Depending on the product, it may vary on how you get it out of the container. But I use Lancome's eyeshadow primer, and what I do is gently pat my finger over the top layer of product, and then distribute the product I have on my finger to my eyelids. Just have enough to barely cover the tip of your finger. Using too much primer will cause it to crease, which isn't what you want.<br>  <br>  For foundation:<br>  If you are doing a full face of foundation, apply a dime-sized amount of primer to your hand and then rub it in circular motions around your face and neck until everything is covered. MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN FIRST. Let it dry, then apply foundation.|`|6aEhPcDAaa	For eyeshadow?  Not a lot, just a little dab with one swipe of the wand.  <br>  <br>  For your foundation, or face primer, just enough to cover wherever you are putting the makeup on.  But you don't have to go overdo.  Maybe just the size of a nickel or quarter.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|hqG2qDh0aa	liverpool is going to win this year baby. or chelsea.
xGmhDTWwaa	I use No. 7 which I love and has really cleared up my skin.<br>  <br>  I use the micro-dermabrasion (twice a week) or the cleanser in the morning then follow up with the day cream. Then I use their mouse foundation cos it matches my skin perfectly and is really light and it feels like I'm not wearing anything. I use maybelline mouse blush.<br>  <br>  In the evening I removed my make-up with the cleanser and follow with night cream (which is amazing). Before bed I apply Johnsons Moon Care Lip Balm which works wonders on dry lips (most chapstick dry my lips, making them worse)<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  For oily skin, maybe try Simple or Neutrogena. Micro-dermabrasion can dry the skin a little and removes dead skin so it's great :o)|`|NF252V79aa	In the morning i dont have a great deal of time so i just cleanse using anti bacterial cleanser to try keep spots at bay and moisturise, but in the evening i exfoliate too and often will use a face mask.|`|BAPj9JW3aa	i always wash my face really good before i go to sleep.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Remove makeup using "Yes to Carrot's" eye/face makeup remover.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Cleanse face using alba facial cleanser.<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 3: Moisturize face with cetaphil spf 15 daily moisturizer.<br>  <br>  <br>  anddd thats it....in the morning i remove oil from my t-zone using e.l.f. blot paper and then apply my makeup.|`|xqYrGjGVaa	Did you know that about 80,000 facial skin cells die every day? This is why your skin can take on a dull, lustreless appearance, accentuating lines and wrinkles on your face if you do not include exfoliation in your daily skin care regime.<br>  <br>  Many women still use commercial soaps that are harsh on your skin and contain chemicals you’d rather not know. The combination of these chemicals and the harshness of these soaps can leave your face dry, robbed of moisture and having removed the protective Acid Mantel, vulnerable to microbes and other potentially harmful environmental factors.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is the first step in any good daily skin care regime. Exfoliation can take a number of forms, you can use a facial clay gel-wash, which removes dirt, stale natural oils as well as gently remove the dead skin cells from your face, leaving your face clean, free of stale oils and dirt, and unblock the pores of your skin.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can use products such as the Skin Renewal Gel from Wildcrafted Herbal Products or a multitude of other natural products that will help to remove the layer of dead skin cells.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is intended to do nothing more than remove dead skin cells, however, you need to be aware of how ‘ruff’ they are. For example, there are chemical exfoliants which will not just attack the dead skin cells, but also harm living cells. This is not the aim of a quality exfoliant, on the contrary, exfoliation is supposed to help promote new growth of skin cells, not attack new cells.<br>  <br>  Similarly, there are natural as well as non-natural exfoliants that have ingredients, which can cause minute cuts and be quite abrasive to your facial skin. Again this is not the type of product you would want to use.<br>  <br>  Exfoliants should contain substances such as high quality clays, herbal extracts and essential oils that are gentle to your skin, but do remove the dead skin layer at the same time. Clay, for example, is made up of rounded particles and because of their shape, they will not irritate or cut your skin nor will they be abrasive to the skin. Essential oils, such as Chamomile are soothing, anti-septic and cleansing. Finally, a good exfoliant should be natural, gentle and contain ingredients that are cleansing and soothing to your skin.<br>  <br>  Danny Siegenthaler is a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine and together with his wife Susan, a medical herbalist and Aromatherapist, they have created Natural Skin Care Products by Wildcrafted Herbal Products to share their 40 years of combined expertise with you.<br>  <br>  Join our Natural Skin Care Newsletter – it’s fun, free and Informative and you receive a free eBook on natural skin care.<br>  <br>  ?

First I wash my face with Neutrogena's Deep Clean Facial cleanser (it's a gel cleanser) and then I use Clinique's dramatically different moisturizer. Sometimes I use Neutrogena's Visibly Clear gentle exfoliating scrub as well. <br>  <br>  I love Neutrogena and would definitely recommend buying their products! So you could try use their Deep Clean cleanser, or their Oil-Free Acne wash. They're both great :D<br>  <br>  All the best! :)|`|UTxt6tOGaa	Im very pimple prone!! I just use a good exfoliator (you can tell a good one by the bitty texture!) like clean & clear daily facial scrub.<br>  <br>  The trick is dont use to many products... they actually make your skin worse as they contain oils which prevent your natural oils from doing what they are supposed to!<br>  <br>  Try just using an exfoliating scrub for a week and see if you can feel a difference. I could!|`|Kn5yxxUpaa	Mix six-teaspoon petroleum jelly, two-teaspoon glycerin and two-teaspoon lemon juice. Apply this moisturizing lotion at least twice a week if you have dry and flaky, arms and legs<br>  Peel and grate a cucumber. Squeeze the juice to this, mix half-a-teaspoon glycerin and half-a-teaspoon rose water. Apply this on sunburns, leave it for some time.<br>  If you have cracked heels, melt paraffin wax; mix it with little mustard oil and apply on the affected area. Leave it overnight. After 10 or 15 days, your heels will become smooth.<br>  Massage your body with a mixture of coconut oil and any of your favourite scented oils like lavender or rosemary.<br>  For rough palms, use a mixture of glycerin and limejuice in equal proportion.<br>  For cracked heals, massage the foot with coconut oil and keep the foot in warm water for some time. Wipe the water off the feet and apply a mixture of hibiscus flower(10), Henna (1 handful) and juice of half a lemon. when dry wash it off.<br>  Remove scars on your hands and feet by rubbing them with lemon peel. to get more detail pls visit my web site
KLxoWHRZaa	maybe red lipstick and smokey eyes are good.|`|kMsShtwpaa	here try these tutorials :]|`|eJd5CPXFaa	i wouldn't match your dress and eyeshadow. thats just silly :)<br>  <br>  i think a sheer gold would look really pretty though.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	A dark brown, black or gray smoky eye would be beautiful with a red dress. I would really recommend brown to complement your eyes and complexion without looking too stark. For a brown smoky eye:<br>  -Use a brown base, like a brown gel eyeliner, to the lid and blending upward just a bit past the crease.<br>  <br>  -Put a matte, dark brown to your eyelid, staying below the crease. <br>  <br>  -Apply a lighter shade of bronze or brown to the crease and blending upward into a neutral highlight.<br>  <br>  -Smudge some black eyeshadow into the top lashline.<br>  <br>  -Apply black pencil eyeliner to the lower waterline, and black eyeshadow to the lower lashline. <br>  <br>  Neutral lips would look great, as they would keep the attention focused on your eyes and not combat the colorful dress you'll be wearing.|`|9BEg5s2Oaa	bronze or gold eyeshadows, black or brown eyeliner, black or brown mascara, a little bit of brownish blush, a thin layer of foundation matching your skin colour, lipgloss with a slight red tint and a clear lipgloss over it!

JdpVNgyxaa	Go up to the counter like a day or two later - don't leave it too late, so they hopefully might vaugely remember your face.<br>  <br>  Bring a friend or your husband for support, and act like you're already going shopping, this is just another stop. It makes it less uptight and more of just a quick stop.<br>  <br>  Approach the counter and be like 'Hey. Well I bought these jeans the other day...Wednesday I think it was...and they were supposedly in the sale as they had the clearance tag on?' <br>  *Show them the tag. Dont remove any labels*<br>  *Show them the recipt*<br>  'But here it says I got charged full price for the jeans that were on clearance? <br>  <br>  And then they'll probably say something. Just keep it short and sweet and don't get too worked up or emotional about it - they should refund you some of the money or likewise straight away using this method.<br>  If they don't, THEN you may show you are upset and stand your ground a bit.<br>  But don't raise your voice / cause a scene or interupt them.<br>  Keep it civil and polite but let them know you are NOT happy.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you'll be refunded back some of the money!<br>  I hope it goes well ;)|`|EAuMJrs4aa	go into the store with the receipt and the item tag still attached of course and explain what happened in the face of overwhelming evidence they have to give the money back<br>  <br>  also your husband should have said "well as its part of your quality assurance policy i want a like for like replacement give me a pair of jeans to the same value you used to sell these at"|`|cbf383accd5c9c730d94b724e132b113aa	Do you remember the cashiers name?

hLdIO43Xaa	Try a sea salt spray---you can even make it yourself!  Before you go to bed, plait your hair into braids and use the spray. When you wake up, take the hair elastics out and BAM! Beautiful beach waves, super soft hair.  It's a "salon secret." :]    Here's a website for more info. The picture's wrong though, the curls are too tight, sea salt spray is for soft waves! There's a recipe too!  http://www.beauty-and-the-bath.com/Sea-S...    Also, Herbal Essences "Hello Hydration" Shampoo and Conditioners are great for dry hair! And they smell absolutely yummy.  http://www.herbalessences.com/us/collect...  Also inexpensive and at the drugstore :]  Also, I bet Aussie is cool, they have pretty good products.    I hope I helped!|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I have to agree with the Herbal Essences O-M-GEEEEEE!|`|4TSmyWmcaa	This question has been asked so many times on here, I have you an answer.  Like the answers as to what everybody else has said. Wash your hair before bed, or a little before that. Depending on when your ideal time would be. When out of the shower, towel dry your hair slightly.. Comb through with comb and then place in plaits all over your head.. Or french plaits, these work alot more. If you're unsure of how to do french plaits you could google them, theres lots of info on there.. Yes so you leave the plaits in over night and then remove them in the morning. They will leave you with flowy wavy hair, alot like beach hair..   And the other answer to your question. Yes I do reccomend any products by 'Aussie' they give great effects, and are long lasting. Also they smell divine. :]

I wouldn't jump right into Platinum just because it's a big change and if you don't like it you'll have to go through a lot to get it back to a color you do like.      I think if you gradually went to Platinum it would look good.  Your eyebrows are a little darker, but I don't think the color would wash you out or make you look funny or anything.  I do think that you would have a lot of up-keep with your roots since you do have such a dark natural color.  But again highlights help a lot with that too.      I have a really bland natural light brown dark blonde hair color, and I always do highlights.  I rarely do all over color, and it keeps longer and looks great!    If you have a regular stylist as him/her what they think as well.  They'll give you great advice too.    Good Luck!|`|LtlXSL51aa	I would suggest you do a heavy highlight  it will be easier to maintain and would look much nicer.  Go to a salon for a consult. They are often free of charge.

0parZMOGaa	First, use a volumising shampoo and conditioner to remove build up in your hair that can weigh it down. slightly towel dry hair to remove excess moisture, then apply a volumising moose or spray. when blow drying hair, blow dry upside down until 80% dry and then use a thick barrelled round brush to dry the rest to smooth it out a bit. you could also tease the hair when it is dry, to add more volume. here is a tutorial on youtube:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzClJs4qNEs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzClJs4qN...</a><br>  hope it helped x|`|rV8mHGO3aa	Use a volumising spray, not a mouse. put it on your ends and blow dry upside down. Start hot and finish with cool air so it sets.<br>  If you are going to do this every day, or often, use a hydrating treatment on your ends as too much blow drying will def. damage hair.|`|u9HDDjDAaa	I have the same problem, this is what works best for me:<br>  <br>  Use a volumising shampoo, it wont do much but it will help.<br>  Wash and blow dry upside down in the mornings.

Also volumizing styling products, Big Sexy hair is great.  Nioxxin is a excellent line also but more expensive. Biotin & Vitamin E help also.

Untrimmed hair may be uneven as it grows.Trim you hair once in every 2 months.<br>  <br>  Use the right hair products-If you have done hair coloring of hair straightening,take care to choose the right hair care products for you hair.Avoid alcohol based hair care products.<br>  <br>  Blow hair and comb upside down.Then give the hair a shake by turning you head to and fro.<br>  <br>  hope i helped! XX|`|w7m52T9Waa	O M G . me too. you put moose in it after a shower, and then blow dry it so that you are like holding you hair from your face. and just keep pulling hair away from your face whilst blowdrying it.<br>  <br>  and give it some volume by using thickening spray..

They both sound great! So yea, the first one :)|`|XYT7jvBdaa	My favorite toner is by Olay. It is simply called "Olay Refreshing Toner", and it's amazing. No toner is going to get rid of acne, create a healthy complexion and calm the skin all by itself. You're going to need a good skincare routine-face wash, toner, exfoliant, moisturizer. The Olay toner is very good, draws out excess oils and leftover dirt from washing one's face, but that alone doesn't give me good skin. Since you seem to want overall skin care ideas, I'll give you my routine to give you an idea:<br>  -Wash face TWICE. Once to get rid of any excess oils, dirt and makeup, and a second time to wash the actual clean skin. <br>  <br>  -Exfoliate once to twice a week. This will get rid of dull, unhealthy skin cells and reveal a brighter complexion.<br>  <br>  -Toner after every time you wash your face.<br>  <br>  -Moisturizer after every time you tone your face. <br>  <br>  It may seem like a lot of work, but it really is worth it for the results you get.
K0BlHseOaa	Depends which type of bronzer you use.

EmOnt7FIaa	Well, I heard this question many times and I do think it is an interesting subject.    I don't think it is fair to base attractiveness on skin tone. There are beautiful people of all colors and less attractive people of all colors. Personally, I am most attracted to brown skin girls, but I have been attracted to light skinned and dark skinned black girls in the past.    It is true that lighter skinned girls, ARE MORE LIKELY, to have colored eyes/hair, because they are more likely to have white ancestry, thus having more white features (colored eyes/hair), but I've seen many darker skinned people with colored hair and eyes, so what those kids were talking about is not valid.    My mom is about my skin tone (I'm brown skinned, maybe slightly lighter than that? I don't know, you be the judge), and she has natural blue/greyish eyes (damn, I wish I got that gene!!!), so you don't have to be light skinned to get those genes. Also, a lot of people that you may think have colored eyes really have contacts on, so you can never tell.    I hate to say this but it is true that most that many black guys probably prefer lighter skinned girls because what is in the media and constantly being bombarded by light skinned black women video girls on music videos and not enough brown and dark skinned black girls (go turn on BET and see for yourself), but I like women of all colors. You should ask this question in the "Polls and Surveys" section, so you can get a wider variety of answers and you can find out what most guys are attracted.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	i mean, there are beautiful people everywhere, be it black white...whatever    each person has their own perception of beauty, so it's really impossible to have a "correct" definition of beautiful|`|JdpVNgyxaa	I don't think that's true at all!  Thats a horrible thing to say, are you sure your school are allowed to say that?  In England someone would probably get fired for that >_>    Skin colour does NOT effect beauty at all!  Like you said, some people are beautiful, some people ain't so.  It's just genetics and a bit of luck - nothing to do with skin colour at all.|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	I agree with you.  There are beautiful people in every race... I think thats a strange question to ask, but I can see how this would be a good debate topic...   I believe it's a personal question rather than a racist question. Personally I like asian women. See? It's just whatever one is attracted too.  Don't forget that beauty isn't only skin deep either.

If you change it too early you can re-damage it and delay healing and cartilage is already a very slow healing piercing (8-12+ months).|`|vGCetYmAaa	i think that i would wait 1-2 more weeks just to be safe.|`|dcLQAdhLaa	they say to wait about 6 to 8 weeks for cartilage i did mine too early and ended up getting a blood blister on my ear.. but thats up to you and how you feel|`|7ES4xMloaa	keep that one in for another month or it will heal wrong|`|BYHRjUa6aa	I have mine pierced too and have changed my earring after 1 month.

[sorry for the bad news] Cartilage piercings can take anywhere from 6 months to a year to heal. And although it may not hurt anymore, the tissue around the piercing is very delicate since it's still healing. You could risk accidentally re pierce your skin. As a result, your piercing could be miss-aligned and as a result, your body may reject the piercing. Just wait a little longer. I know the wait is gonna suck, but your body will thank you for it =]|`|16iTs0Dvaa	You can change it after 12 weeks. Although it will have healed on the outside, it will still be healing on the inside and it's dangerous to remove it before it's properly healed because it's easily infected and the hole will close up really fast.|`|p6AZS94Daa	They say u should wait at lease 6weeks.    So u got another 2 weeks to go...Buddy|`|95Hw7cHKaa	Don't change it!  Even if it doesn't hurt it could still get infected very very easily.  Just keeping cleaning it.

eQQWdk0uaa	You should never do something permanent to make someone else happy.  It's not betraying anyone when you are being true to yourself.  Either way, cancel tomorrow's appointment!  If you really want it gone, you need to talk to your parents.  As you said, they may FLIP but they will probably flip more if they see it one day or hear about it.|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	I was going to answer this question until I read Nicci's answer.  I think she put it better than I could have and was much nicer about it than I would have been.  This is an example of why I think everyone should have to pass a questionaire test before getting a tattoo.|`|OBnNGcfHaa	Honestly you should have thought about that before you got the tattoo. Tattoo's are FOREVER no cream is going to make this go away. Even if you have it removed there will still be some scarring. Sounds like you are more upset about coming clean to your parents. Just be honest with your parents I think you will feel alot better in the morning. Let this be a lesson learned that when it comes to your body, you are the one who is in control. Not your boyfriend or anyone else. If it feels wrong chances are it is wrong.|`|p7CCJx1raa	just tell your boyfriend and sure enough if he loves you to he wont mind. its up to you do want your comfortable with.|`|KgOvoFThaa	talk to him|`|UcezPQcjaa	Hey, thats so funny your writing this today.<br>  I was 16 when i got my first tattoo,*(im 18 now) i had been with my bf for only 3 months and i was convinced i was gonna marry him,<br>  Okay he got my initials on his hand, <br>  and i got his FULL NAME <br>  (Ricky) on my hip, just like you.<br>  <br>  It hurt like hell and it didnt come out that great. I felt the same exact way!!! i didnt even want to look at myself in the mirror.<br>  But i got used to it, once it healed i just ignored it.. i love him n thats all that mattered.<br>  <br>  Now if your REALLY upset about it there is a fading cream you can you but you have to wait until the tattoo is healed to use it,<br>  Its called wrecking balm.<br>  Look it up.<br>  Its not supposed to make the tattoo vanish in one application, its supposed to fade it little by little until you cant see it.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is getting my  name  ( Paige) on his chest in a week, im excited.<br>  <br>  I hope he got a tattoo for you|`|clInlnIqaa	Well let's not beat the girl up over this. This sounds more of a serious situation than her just getting and regretting a tattoo. You really need to sit down and explain to your boyfriend that this is not what you want. That you are just not ready for a tattoo. If he does not understand that, then he is not the one for you. <br>  <br>  I suppose you could try wrecking balm. But since I have no expierence with tattoo removal, then I don't know how it would work. Your best bet is to get it removed by lasers. And you need to tell your parents. Coming clean to them and talking to them in an adult way will gain a lot of respect out of your parents.|`|Cavz3kAPaa	This ladies & gentlemen, is number one reason you should NEVER get an underage tattoo, nor should you ever get one if you aren't 100% sure. And shame on the tattoo studio for giving you a tattoo when you are both underage, and not sure about getting one in the first place.<br>  <br>  First of all, cancel the appointment for tomorrow. Do not get it done.<br>   <br>  Tell you're boyfriend that the tattoo isn't what you want, and you don't need something permanent on your body. You are NOT betraying him. If he gets angry at you, then is he really worth it. <br>  <br>  Laser surgery is going to burn off layers of skin. It's not going to be pleasant. It probably will take a few treatments. I have heard of a cream from another user on here, but it's only available in Europe, and I can't remember what it's called. Apparently it strips the skin, which I assume would be incredibly painful as well.<br>  <br>  As hard as it is, I probably would tell your parents. Just do it properly, something like this<br>  <br>  "Mum & Dad, is now a good time to have a chat? Yesterday I did something really stupid and I regret it now, and I'm coming to you for help because I know I made a mistake. I went and got a tattoo, but it was really stupid because I'm underage, I didn't think about it properly, nor did I really want it in the first place. I know I have to be responsible for my own mistakes, but I was wondering if you were able to help me find ways to remove this tattoo, and help me out financially with it as well. Of course I will put as much money to it up front as I can, and I'm more than willing to pay you back for it. I'd really appreciate the help, and I won't do anything like this again without thinking it through properly and talking to you first."<br>  <br>  Please Please Please learn from your mistake. And everyone else who reads this. DO NOT GET A TATTOO UNLESS YOU ARE 100% SURE!!<br>  <br>  (And yes I am yelling, because I can't stress this enough!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lvlCJDO3aa	1 you should have figure that out b4 you got it done..<br>  2 i sure hope he got a tatt for you..<br>  3 what does a dove mean?<br>  4 how did u get it done you have to be at least 18 or have a parent there<br>  5 ur *** is grounded wen ur parents find out i should know it happened to me ... girl only difference i got one on my lower back and its of my bF name NATHAN  well sad to say he's now my ex well at least i can say its there for my son yes i had his baby .....

dKPFjQymaa	I have been to Bosley, been to hair club for men, etc.  <br>  <br>  Trust me when I say this.  In the long run, hair transplants will save you the most money but it depends on who you go to.<br>  <br>  Bosley and Hairclub for men are just money makers.  They get you to try their products and fall for their service.  It is not top notch service as they portray and it is really expensive.  <br>  <br>  I have personally seen a family member of mine undergo two surgeries for hair transplantation with Bosley.  Not only were they terrible, they left him with a scar, and they overcharged him way too much money.  Their surgeons are more like rookies I think and they are used to creating very mature looking hairlines.  Another family member went to hair club for men and they got him to buy a hairpiece for a grand or two.  The hairpiece was hideous and they did not refund his money.  Not only that they get you to join their vitamin/supplement program with their "special" shampoos to maintain or regrow your hair.  That program costs thousands of dollars over the years.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'll tell you what works for sure.  If you have not tried Rogaine or Propecia, then you should.  They definitely are the only known remedies that work to preserve or grow hair.  Talk to your doctor about them.<br>  <br>  If you want an outstanding hair transplant that is affordable and high quality, well then I can recommend a doctor by the name of Dr. Rahal.  I have seen his work and I am interested myself in getting a transplant done by him.  He is a lot cheaper then other surgeons and his work is absolutely amazing.  I have been researching on the best hair cures and transplants and that is the conclusion I have come to after one year.  I was really scared of the whole process, but in the end, the transplant will save you the most bucks and headache.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, you wont have to rely on special shampoos or vitamins or hair concealers and etc.  Once you have your hair transplanted, that is it, then you just live your life.<br>  <br>  I personally have not contacted the doctor I chose for surgery yet but plan on doing so in the future as I want to have my procedure in the summer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  And remember, if you are going to do something for your looks and well being, then you might as well do it right.|`|jvLCHuqTaa	To know if you are an eligible candidate for hair restoration you would need to see a hair restoration specialist. From the website I found there is no minimum age for treatment, however it does say that most are over 21. Hair Restoration generally costs between $4000 and $5000 but can get as expensive as $12000 depending on the doctor, and how much you are getting to restored. The website I found mentioned that grafts cost between $3-$10 per graft but the number of hairs a doctor puts in per graft can very so it suggested seeing a doctor and asking him/her about it. If I was doing hair restoration I would see a few different doctors and weigh the pros/cons of each one to make your best decision. Who knows you may be able to mention the different prices to each doctor to see if you can get your favorite to lower his/her price! Do remember that cheapest does not always mean the best quality.

2Dy6jZBtaa	legs should be fairly the same length for everyone 5'4"...ur back has so many vertebrate and they only vary in size by so much for each certain height that it really wouldn't matter and ur legs would be the same height as the next person 5'4" if u have proper posture...usually it appears u have longer legs because ur legs are in fact thinner. less weight on the legs makes them look longer, if u look at a model, the thin as can be model seems to appear to have very lengthy legs compared to the plus size model the same height. <br>  there are long's in pants size though, a 33-34 inch inseam for those taller at about 5'8.5" and up.<br>  so to answer ur question, its about width rather than length as leg length doesn't vary too much to notice at all on a person, any person the same height...the only way ur legs would be longer is if ur taller as ur proportions are a bit bigger and longer overall in bone structure.|`|kUhcypC9aa	I am 5'6" and have pretty long legs.

xGmhDTWwaa	Get a razored cut, it's like layers but less prominent and thins the hair whereas layers tend to make it appear even thicker. Try products for anti frizz, you can get hairprays, shampoos and just sprays for when you blow dry :o) Also straighten it every once in a while, you could get some steam hairstraightners which dry it out less. A good conditioner will probs ease the frizz too :o)<br>  <br>  Hope that helped x|`|MtsfAnXVaa	you gotta trim those pubes daily man..they get out of control|`|9QF6GGyiaa	I recommend frizz ease. You apply frizz ease to wet hair.
vTfEYeKQaa	It all depends on who does it, where ya get it done, and exactly how big and how long it takes. Take the pic to your tattoo artist and ask how much they would charge. There's really no way to tell unless you ask.|`|Hhifw93laa	thats a pritty tat but it all depends on where you go my guess is ant where between 150 american $ to 250 american $|`|HvbIE03saa	If it's exactly like the picture, then I'd say between $150-300. I know that's a big stretch, but it depends on who does it. You'd definitely be saving some money if it's in black and not in color though.<br>  <br>  And just so you know, be prepared for a lot of pain if you're getting it along your side like that. I know a lot of people who've gotten tats down the side like that, and they HURT, especially across the ribs.<br>  <br>  One girl was getting one in color and the tattoo artist did the black outline first and she said if she'd known how much it hurt, she wouldn't have gotten it done, but since he'd already done the outline, she had to go through and tough it out for the color.|`|UGyFH75Paa	i'd guess around 350 based on what i've seen my friends get. couple of my bros have tats and one is real good artists himself. i always ask how much they pay for it|`|qPfhXZw0aa	I would say about $175. But your best bet would be to take the picture to a tataoo shop and ask them....|`|1B7hQ0Gmaa	it would cost around $100-250<br>  tattoos are pretty expensive&herts not to scare you :D<br>  but yeah<br>  <br>  hope aye i helped xD

ZyK5fW2yaa	nope. not recommended.... it will be uber painful trying to tpu it back in which will cause redness, tenderness, pain, very high chance of infection which raises the possibility of keloid scarring... research about keloids. No one wants a keloid, especially on their face.  I would say it would be much more worth it to you to wait until rugby season is over.  <br>  <br>  Here are a few good reasons to wait: <br>  <br>  50-75 bucks for piercing alone<br>  $$ for aftercare items, although it shouldn't cost you more than ten <br>  pain of getting it done<br>  you want to enjoy it for more than two weeks|`|rL866v8Baa	No it's to soon, so you'll either have to quit or just reconsider getting it done.<br>  <br>  If you still want to play sport and have a piercing you could always cover it with a band aid etc. That's what I did with my eyebrow so it may work for you. Only problem is it's looks a bit stupid and you have to clean it asap after any exercise because of sweat and dirt.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	No, No, No!<br>  By 2-4 weeks, the piercing is not going to be completely healed. So by taking it out you are going to be exposing the piercing wound itself to so much more bacteria, and that could lead to a terrible infection. And when the piercing is not fully healed, it is best to avoid even TOUCHING it (aside from cleaning it) for that same reason. Avoid getting the piercing until rugby season is over so that you'd be able to care for it properly without a removal.|`|u9HDDjDAaa	No, you never really take them out their different to ear piercings. Think it over if you can't have them for footy.|`|AkFIVDjQaa	i've had mine for 2 weeks exactly & i can take it out for about 2 hours & its fine<br>  just make sure you put it straight back in & clean it<br>  & don't touch it with unwashed hands<br>  <br>  x

XYT7jvBdaa	You probably cannot get rid of them, but there are tricks to make them look less chubby and more defined. It's called contouring.<br>  To contour you will need a shade of dark neutral or even dark brown blush, a pink or peach blush, and a highlight color (I just use a shimmery white eyeshadow). <br>  -Suck in your cheeks. With an angled blush brush, apply the darkest neutral or brown blush to the hollows of your cheeks (they are revealed when you suck your cheeks in). Blend the line upwards to avoid it looking like war paint. <br>  <br>  -With a fluffy, soft blush brush, apply the pink or peach blush to the apples of your cheeks. Since you've got a chubby face, apply it at more of a diagonal line, starting from halfway through the apple and up toward your temple (to see where the apples of your cheeks are, just smile!)<br>  <br>  -Apply your highlight color. This should be a few shades lighter than your skin tone, and is meant to reflect light to bring out certain features of the face. Highlight color usually goes on the tops of the cheeks, down the bridge of the nose, on the chin, the middle of your forehead and above your lip.|`|9BEg5s2Oaa	you cant get rid of them, but here are some make up tips to make them look less chubby:<br>  take a big brush and brush some natural looking, sheer colored blush below the cheek bone. and you can also try making a fish face thing and while applying it so that it will make that contoured line. then apply a sheer shimmering white color about the cheeks bones and up toward you hair line, this will make the light reflect more on your cheek bones. and remember not to apply too much you want the results to look natural. and make sure to blend well. good luck i hope this helps :)|`|ANRTDInTaa	you need to suck them in. its more of a cheeck exercise (it should look as though you're imitating the mouth of a fish)...u shd do it whener you have time...i mean its something you can do at school, work, while jogging, etc.so go ahead and suck them in...
fcf482bdec50dfb1709123d1836c18a6aa	I see your point you want a piercing, but as someone else has said monroes now look chavvy. You don't want anything to hugely detract from your natural beauty, I think a nose piercing would be ideal. They're discrete enough and you can get lovely coloured lil gems that would just set it off (cuute!)|`|9MdBQC8baa	Seriously Please don't <br>  Your a pretty girl do you really want that ugly thing drawing attention away from your nice features!<br>  Monroes are just so gross they remind me of moles!<br>  Just stic with the way you are now! & stay pretty! =)|`|bUqh8fo4aa	I think you shouldn't you're pretty and will ruin your looks|`|bznQW3QYaa	NO<br>  you would look better without it|`|QznZTz4aaa	Your Yummy!|`|brvOa9QYaa	I don't really like snake bites very much although they're cool, but I like labret piercings. the monroe is on top and I dont really like that but the labret is under the lip and would suit u, why did he dump you, your like really pretty!|`|nRzNSAu2aa	personally i think the monroe looks like you are walking around with food stuck to your face, but its your face so do what you want with it!|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Please don't do it you're gorgeous and it would make you look like a chav!|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	No your hot dont get a peircing that looks like a huge mole.|`|nYB5aJYzaa	I have snakebites and they are awesome, I think you would definitely suit a Monroe piercing very well.

c3b11df445c85a57854c19a1ff159cddaa	Make your make up natural, apply natural looking foundation, if your skin is good enough to not wear any just moisturise it, sweep a peachy blusher on your cheeks and keep makeup to a minimum just curl your lashes and a touch of eyeliner<br>  If your hair is wet when you want to style put it in a bun or two depending on the thickness of your hair and sleep with it like that or blow dry it or if it's dry put it in 6 or 8 plaits, again depending on the thickness of your hair, then hairspray and straighten it, this will make it wavy, CAUTION!! if you do too many plaits you will end up with a frizzy afro not a good luck, trust me i have made this mistake!!!<br>  For clothes just check out her style on magazines, keep it fun and flowy and you can't go wrong<br>  Good luck :)|`|SKe9LcOfaa	"vintage" clothes you can find real good quality ones at the markets that are not ratty/smelly and having natural looking hair aka not perfectly coiffed 24/7|`|mfZvg4rGaa	Just look at some pictures and try to match the clothes.<br>  Headbands are very boho and in at the moment.|`|jxudIY5Taa	Gain 400 pounds, cut your hair up to your ears, dye it ugly brown, wear stretch pants and a fake-fur bra, make sure there is ALWAYS a cigarette hanging out of your mouth, grow female facial hair, stop bathing, and move into a trailer.

It can damage your hair severly and your hair will snap off either way. I suggest you go to the hairdressers and slowly get blonde or caramelised foils through your hair.

It will take a long time although it often keeps your hair roots attached to your hair. <br>  Hope i helped =]|`|DocWavqiaa	get a hair stripper it wont turn orange the same as bleach then out a tint of blond on it or just leave the stripped colour if you like it
qQqC2cHIaa	Maybe you should use a scare tactic on your mom. Tell her that sudden extreme hair loss can be an early warning sign of several serious medical conditions including thyroid disease, diabetes, and some types of malignant cancers. It can also be the sign of a hormone imbalance, especially if you are  going through adolescence. It can be a sign that you are suffering from a vitamin deficiency, which could be diet related or a sign of something else. It can also be the result of fungal or bacterial overgrowth.  All of these problems can be treated by a doctor. It could be trauma to the hair, a chemical burn, a new drug your are taking, reaction to a shampoo, you could simply be wearing your ponytails and braids far too tight.   It's safer to go to the doctor and find out it's nothing more than stress or fungus or ponytails rather than wait and find out too late that it's something serious.   Look up sudden hair loss on some medical sites, they will repeat the same thing I said here. <br>  <br>  According to Web MD, an american site, you have three of six warning signs of when to call a doctor for hair loss.  The two of you need to see a doctor and find out what's wrong.|`|s9aTmNHQaa	Hi Ausie, I'm Kiwi :), I've had the same problem and no-one took it seriously except me, in the end everytime I washed my hair I collected all the hair sitting in the drain (smelly), after 3 weeks I showed my friend (I was too embarrassed to show anyone else).  After she got over her horror that I had actually collected it, she helped me make a doctors appointment.  Where I found out I was losing my hair because of stress.  <br>  No-one knows how much hair you are losing except you, so collect it (if you can) and present it to your mum.  Good luck!|`|lg8gqyWVaa	it's probably the permanent if you don't FEEL sick you know.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	you should see a professional doctor to get a firmly well diagnosis.<br>  <br>  but after seeing various docs, and they still give you the same diagnosis, you should not doubt that the diagnosis is wrong.<br>  <br>  by the way i think your aussie, since you used the term "heaps" alot.

ZgBmHZgmaa	"Curing a nail" is where you get rid of fungal infections;<br>  <br>  Keep the nail dry. The toughest thing about getting rid of the fungal infection is keeping the nail away from water. It will only add to the nail's moisture and keep the nail bed wet, where fungi just love to grow. This means when you take a shower, the hand or finger must remain outside of the stall. (Maybe even in a loose plastic bag or rubber glove.) But make sure air can still circulate so that the hand doesn't sweat, thus defeating the whole purpose of leaving the hand outside the shower in the first place. Also, when washing dishes, doing the laundry or any other activity containing water, the hand must be protected in the same way, but wear a rubber glove or loose fitting plastic bag. <br>  <br>  Step2Remove nail polish. To cure nail fungus, you must keep the nail exposed to light. Fungi love to grow in dark areas. So once you discover nail fungus, remove all nail polish immediately until you cure the nail. <br>  <br>  Step3Try the home remedies. Some people suggest mixing apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide in a fifty-fifty solution, soaking the hands for 45 minutes for several days to see if this helps cure the finger nail fungus. Others suggest using a cap full of Clorox bleach in a tall glass of water. Soak your finger in the solution for about a minute and again repeat over several days to see if the fungus is alleviated. <br>  <br>  Step4Use topical creams. There are several topical creams which can be found at your local pharmacy. Some may be prescription, so you may have to see a doctor, however the FDA has been becoming more lenient with the topical creams it is approving for over-the-counter use. "Naftin" and "The Toenail and Nail Fungus Treatment" are both reputable brands. <br>  <br>  Step5Use Oral Medication. Leucatin and Lamisil are two products which can be taken orally to help cure your finger nail fungus. For Lamisil you will have to make an appointment with your doctor as it is a prescription product. <br>  <br>  Step6Remove the nail. This is the last resort, and also not necessarily a cure depending on the kind of fungus you have. Obviously for this step, you will need to be under the advisement of a

Y7zAtO57aa	ok ok calm down<br>  i think the best thing to do is #1. don't keep touching it, your hands are full of germs<br>  #2. i'm sure your fringes kind of caused the pimples, so don't keep messing with your hair because that will make yout hair oily which will keep touching your skin, causing pimples<br>  #3. buy skin toner and lotion for before sleeping and foam for washing face<br>  #4. if your parents have lots of pimples, then i guess your pimples are kind of natural and part of your gene so it may not be your fault however it's imnportant to keep your skin and whatever that touched your skin clean (if you can't handle not touching your fringes, at least at home, wear a hairband or something to prevent the oily contact)<br>  #5. o and if you are desperate, i think it's more important that you go to a good skin doctor and ask for suggestions, they are the best at answering these kind of questions, not yahoo answerers:) haha<br>  anyways good luck!|`|RYLkjYkIaa	Go and see a doctor, dont listen to what people advice u, they should see the place and the ponge of yr skin, its something sensitive here and u dont want to mess it there<br>  <br>  <br>  Pls Pls Pls Pls Listen to me here

XYT7jvBdaa	I was a DD by the time I was thirteen years old, so really there is no "right" or "normal" size. It depends on a lot of factors. As long as you feel comfortable with their size, they're just fine.|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	Nope its normal.

kXAH1eW1aa	Hello Sunflower,<br>  How are you? My name is Cassandra Lane, I am a Certified Beauty Advisor with Avon.  For under eye dark circles, I recommend Avon's ANEW ALTERNATIVE Intensive Eye Cream AM/PM.  Here is the description: <br>  <br>  Reclaim brighter, younger-looking skin around eyes.<br>  The brightest innovation in herbaceutical skincare. Anti-aging science and Eastern healing herbs unite to attack the major signs of dark circles and treat the age-related conditions that can make them look worse.<br>  <br>  For best results, use after moisturizing with either ALTERNATIVE Intensive Age Treatment Day SPF 25 or ALTERNATIVE Intensive Age Treatment PM at night. .5 fl. oz.|`|kVX1aVCCaa	how old are you? you can get them lasered off (: if you're younger, just try to get as much sleep as you can, and watch less tv and eletronic stuff. eat heathy, too. anyway : laser works! go get it done at a hospital, not a clinic.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Consume atleast three litres of water on a daily basis. Water is a very essential remedy in this case and it flushes out the toxins present in the body. Check out <a href="http://useinfo-darkcircles.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://useinfo-darkcircles.blogspot.com/</a> for more info.|`|sHA1iugxaa	Try to get some more sleep and be less anxious ( that is if you are ).<br>  Anger and stress tend to cause that as well.<br>  You also might want to try a cream of some kind. I tried Loreal but without much success.<br>  I came across a short article about IQDerma and decided to get a free sample.<br>  The article was at HeelsnCoffee.com|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Sometimes, sorry to say, they cannot be gotten rid of. They tend to be genetic.|`|KhC2zSvnaa	I use all about eyes from clinique. It helps with the circles and the puffiness|`|ZtY9xWzyaa	If you use a good eye cream, you can get rid of those dark circles. You want a cream with lots of vitamins and collagen boosting ingredients. Try a Kinerase cream. Kinerase has been proven to be an effective moisturizer as well as great for regenerating aging skin cells. Keep up the diet and other good habits and try a Kinerase cream. You'll notice a difference.

Cub8LmfXaa	hi,if you suffer with excess hair,have you thought about going to a salon and having a warm wax treatment? it can be done on the face. bleaching is another option also. but i recommend only get it done in a salon,not at home. you could have epilation done,but it involves needles and a lot of money.plus its painful.the results are permanent.<br>  as for cosmetics what about bare minerals,its a powder so unlike the cream foundation wont show up or clogg up around the hair.its natural also and you can build up the coverage as much as you like as its so light in texture.there is a corrective make up you can buy may be from qvc. but goggle it,im sure there are plenty to choose from.<br>  sorry if i went on a bit about the hair but i thought if you solve that problem maybe your skin would be better.<br>  <br>  just noticed what you,added. a salon will only do treatment if you are over 16. but bleaching is an option which salons will do for young adults<br>  <br>  BARE MINERALS- qvc website or hqhair.com. jane irdale also does mineral makeup too. google for mineral makeup. there is another brand called dolollyo or something like that. that should come up during your search,they do small samples too. the nice thing about mineral powders is that there is no right or wrong way to use them. i have two different shades. one light one medium. you can also mix them together.|`|JaOddaodaa	Its best if u undergo a cosmetic surgery...........<br>  but it then........<br>  actually u said u r plucking ur hair, is it so thick that u cant control it by "threading"?<br>  <br>  okay, since u said that ur face's skin colour looks uneven, u want a make up....<br>  concealer will not do, u can use a liquid base one shade darker to ur face's colour.....in this way, ur face will look a bit darker but u will be able to conceal ur uneven skin colour.<br>  try it, let me know if it worked.|`|MmR9LeLhaa	just shave it,or wax x3<br>  anyways concealer wont cover hair,but it will probably cover uneven skin tone,also wear some foundation and powder :) x|`|1A9TdN4yaa	use beaten up egg whatever day on the face it is a natural bleach. This treatment needs patience but it helps. Wax and concealers are not good for long run, Wax will mature your skin very early as you will be playing with the elasticity of the skin and concealers will thicken your skin and make it hard and undesirable.
