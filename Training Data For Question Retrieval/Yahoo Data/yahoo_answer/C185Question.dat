He has a week doing it already.  could it be teething or exploring or something.  He already eats solid foods and has a good amount of teeth.  Or maybe he gets food stuck behind his gums and tries to get it out with his hand.  Can anybody give me a reason......is it normal or is my baby just krazy...??

20090304091408AAr51Ss	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What has got you through the sad days of TTC?	I have been feeling really down this month with TTC (had a real false positive - not an evap line!) so I wondered what things are helping you through the more difficult days.      Yesterday, through a really long and complex series of events, God led me to this rhyme which brought tears (of happiness for once) to my eyes because I realised He was trying to tell me something. Thought some others on here might find this encouraging too:      Persevering      Ambitions are fine,      It’s good to aim high,      If things are worth having      We all have to try.      So you must keep on going,      Try not to give in      If your goal is the prize      It’s important to win.      It’s too easy to feel      That life is unjust,      If you need reassurance      Ask someone you trust.      Give it your best shot,      And if it fails, then      Pick yourself up      And try it again.      Here’s something I’ve found      And I’m sure you’ll agree,      The harder you practise      The better you’ll be!         Please share things that have helped you to brighten up my world a little bit :-)

20090304091615AAf6XSN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My baby hasn't pooped since Sunday night?!?!?	I started feeding my baby solids two weeks ago. My son ate about one tablespoon of rice cereal mixed with about an ounce of breast milk for the first week with no problems. I started him on oatmeal and breast milk Monday and he seemed to really gobble it up. Well, he hasn't pooped since Sunday night. Should I be concerned? This is really not like him. When he was just breastfeeding he would have poop in his diaper when he woke up in the morning and then he would poop right after his first feeding of the day. It was like clock work. He has not been acting constipated, by grunting or acting in pain.       I should also add that I have been really sick with what I thought was food poisoning. I have been sick with a fever, throwing up, and diarrhea since Saturday night and am only now starting to feel better. Could this be the cause?

20090304091609AACJ0us	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	19 Month Old Son Refuses to Talk?	My 19 going on 20 Month old son refuses to talk.  He says Dada, Baba, and Mama on occasion.  Usually he just Babels his life away all day long, pulling you by the hand when he wants something.  He answers commands like get a book, or put something in the garbage he'll even turn on the TV when asked, or turn off the light, he also understands Open and Close.  But he refuses to talk.  When asked to repeat a word, he simple smiles like "I'm not going to do it".  I am very frustrated.  I work in the day time, while he's home with his father, who claims to try to help him learn words.  Any words of advice or activities I can use to get him to talk, or is he just lazy.
20090304092047AAThsKT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Can a person love an adopted child just as much as a biological child or is blood thicker than water?	I personally lean toward the blood is thicker than water idea.   Because not everybody can.      I believe some people can do this but some try and can't.       Not everyone can open up there heart enough to even try to love a child that isn't theirs      I'd like to think I could love a child truely love a child that isn't biologically mine but I'm not sure I can.   I'm sure it has a lot to do with my situation.      Not having a child of my own is a big fear of mine. I believe the first nine months during pregnancy is a very important time for bonding and I can't imagine not being able to do that.         I will say I was raised by my mother and adopted by my stepfather. They have a child together and that child has everything she could ever want. they love that child unconditionally and she can do no wrong. Me on the other hand they couldn't wait for me to leave. I wasn't part of their perfect unit. Once they had my sister there was no love for me anymore. I will say I am closer to my stepfather than my actual mother but still its very obvious which child they love more and they make it clear that they love their child together way more.      I don't like that feeling.       I know what its like to be less loved. I can see the cycle possibly repeating and I don't like that. So hopefully I will have my own kids because I don't want an adoptive child to feel like they were my last choice      (I may adopt oneday in the future after having my kids)      I know we are all human but I just wanted to get some perspective from those who have adopted and were adopted
20090304091725AAPhSPq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, I need some help regarding college or another child?	My husband and I have one child, he's 15 months old.   We do want to have another (hopefully a little girl), but I just can't see a good time start trying in the future.      Let me explain.   I just started going back to school online part time, and it will take four years for me to get my degree in education. By the end of the four years, my son will be starting school and I can finally go get a job.       But I figure if we have a baby in the next few years, then I will have to wait until "she" (hopefully) is in school before I can begin a job. I really, really want to work. Just because it's something to do and I could get out of the house and we could used the extra income, but I feel like I am ready for another child right now. I am completely at a stand still on what to do.      What would you do? Or how do you suggest I plan out these next 4 years?

He's sleeping more than usual and not taking his bottles as well as normal! He's rubbing his bottom gum with his tongue a lot so I figured he was teething, I put teething gel on his gums but only that stopped him crying for a second. He just wants to be held all the time but only by me! We had him at the doctor last week b/c I thought something was really wrong as he was crying so much but doctor said he was fine! He was colicky but has really come out of it. Has anybody elses baby been like this ? Do you think it's just teething?

We would use her real name but we were looking for something with a little bit of a twist, that's not as common.      I came across the name Maraya (ma-ray-uh).      It's not made up, it's a variant of the spanish name Mireya, I just think the spelling is nicer.  She could also go by the nn Raya, which I think is adorable :)      What do you think?

20090304092252AAuI3zR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would you get an abortion if their was a high chance of birth defects?	I am so stressed out. My question is this- If you wanted a baby and really didn't believe in abortions anyways,would you make an exception if the doctor told you their was a good chance the baby could come out with major birth defects? Including one limb shorter than the other or no fingers,mush brain, partial paralized, etc... He also said that he has seen babies come out healthy. I was taking tegretol. I see alot of people have healthy babies that have taken the med but there is still that great chance. He can't do testing until 15 weeks. At that point I could find out but I don't know if I could personally get an abortion that far along. So anything helps. Im so torn.

20090304095835AAqpVSL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy and pill dilema, any  help please!?	Ok.   My girlfriend is on the pill.      She took the pills week 1, 2 and all but the last of week 3.      We had sex they day she should have taken her last pill, but took it around 30 minutes later as we remembered.      Our problem is she never came on here period, we were worried as it had been 4 days and thought something could be up, but sunday night she said its fine because she is feeling period pains and alas, monday morning on the way to work she text me to say she came on.      I was relieved, however the next day she told me how since then it stopped, and only showed signs of a couple of hours on her period.    Its now 2 days later and she is yet to continue with the period.      I am 19 and she is 17, we are quite young and naive and have no idea what to do.       She is scared to go to the doctors in fear of her parents being contacted and being a boy, i dont no much else we can do.      I have herd of sex clinics but have no idea how to find them or what to search for.      Any help would/advice would be greatly apreciated.       Thankyou

She had sex with her boyfriend, unprotected, and he ejaculated in her, she took the after morning pills a couple hours after, didnt wait the 12 hours to take the second. She took a pregnancy test before she took the pills because she was afraid that she was pregnant since she was one week late. She still hasnt seen her period and is planning on taking another pregnancy test, tell me, how accurate is the pregnancy test and pills?

20090304101403AAiPqoT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Weening suggestions...?	I am going to start weening my daughter (she has been breastfed since birth and does not/will not take a bottle).  She is now 14 months old and eats regular food like she should, but continues to nurse about 3- 5 times through the course of the day and night.  She is very reliant on this to help her go to sleep (I know not good!!) but CAN sleep without it if she has to, with great struggle lol!   How would I go about starting this process?  It doesn't matter how long it takes us, as I am at home with her all the time.  (My husband and I said we would ween her before trying for another baby and we are ready)  I am ready to do this and know that she doesn't require it any longer.     We have had days when she has only nursed once because of the day's activities and it hasn't bothered her at all, just me: ouch lol!  Then some days she signs that she wants to nurse and has a breakdown if I don't let her right away?!  She absolutely refuses to drink cows milk in her cup. (Our doctor said it's normal because she has a milk source)   Any suggestions on how we should begin this process? Thank you :)

Yesterday I woke up and my eye was a little crusty and then I realized it was a little red, I decided maybe it just got irritated since I don't know how I could have gotten pink eye but anyways today I woke up and it wasn't crusty but it was redder or pinker whichever. I'm going to try to get to the doctors today, my question is can the pink eye hurt the baby? Or will the medicine they give me? Of course I will let them know I am pregnant, has this ever happened to anyone else? I wash my hands constantly I don't know how I got pink eye it's very strange.

I do feel spanking is okay when needed.   Growing up I was spanked twice both times I deserved it and I never repeated those actions again.      There are times we are in the store and we see kids throwing fits and being bad......and mom or dad is saying "I'll give you to 3......1 2 3"   The kid could care less.....or they threaten and the kid doesn't care because its an empty threat most likely.           And I just think to myself "Please dicipline your child, don't make the rest of us suffer."         Sometimes I think a quick swat to the behind would do a whole lot of good.      I am truely afraid of who is going to be running our country and world in the near future.      Its seems there is too much being the kids friend and not enough parenting?         Sorry I didn't mean to get on a soapbox.

20090303110627AA8ra2A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think respect is earned or deserved?	I am baffled that some people think respect can only be earned.  I do think that there are certain levels of respect that need to be earned.  I appreciate when someone tries to gain my trust and earn my respect.  However I think everyone, even complete strangers deserve a certain level of common courtesy and respect.  Human nature is to be selfish.  To think of yourself first.  It's always important in my opinion to put forth an effort to act differently and treat others with respect.  (For example holding doors, saying please and thank you, helping someone in need load their groceries-  the list could go on and on)      What are your thoughts?
20090304071723AA1CeHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why does my child do this?	Every single morning after my year and a half year old wakes up, she'll play in her crib with her cuddle toys for a few minutes before she throws them over the side.  Then she will start talking to them "doggy fell over" etc, until she starts screaming and crying because she can't reach them.        Lately, she's been waking up in the middle of the night, throwing them over the side and then screaming and crying, no talking first (I think it's because she's still half asleep when she does it and then immediately regrets it).  I go in, give her the toys, lay her back down and she falls back asleep.      Why does she do this?  Is it just to get me to go in there?  Sometimes she'll continue playing in her crib once I give her the toys,yet other times she'll want out of her crib asap.  All advice and information is welcome.  Thank you :-)

20090303102357AATbIRs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Unsafe choice to allow a 10 year old to babysit a 4 year old for a couple hours?	We live in a city population about 100,000 & I recently found out my ex allowed his 10 year old son to babysit our 4 year old son, while dad was away for a couple hours. I checked local neglect investigation guidelines, and apparently children age 11-14 can be allowed to babysit for 1-2 hours (as long as there's good mental health, ect...) And they live in an apartment building, so other adults are nearby. I just keep wondering if the 10 year old would know what to do if the 4 year old got burned or started choking ect...   My feelings in the matter a somewhat teetering. I've had the discussion with all my kids about strangers, don't answer the door, ect... and even taken tips off of episodes of Dateline NBC about the tricks predators can use to lure children.   I don't even leave my 10 year old daughter at home alone,  just this past summer I've finally allowed her to cook her own eggs & go on bike rides with her friends with out an adult present.   Am I being way overprotective? I read that 'smothering' a child can later result is rebellious behavior..which I really don't want to happen. But I want to be sure my kids are safe.    Anyone with kids of the same age have opinions on this situation?

20090304075840AA66zBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do i do about this?	i know it sounds very trivial but it really does get to me.      im 16years old and in year 11 studying for my gcses. my biology teacher has a go at me alot for being disruptive (i get bored v.easy and lose focus ALOT) he has decided that i have to sit at the back away from everyone and he thinks im only refusing because i just dont want to. i lost my temper at him yesterday and he gave me a detention about it. today i felt a bit emotional about it haha not crying or angry but i feel strongly about it. erm so i calmly talked to him and said that i dont work well on my own because im not an independent worker, and i dont cope well by myself etc. (cant rememebr everything i said) and he was like well you will have to sit there. so i said to him if you talk to mrs bean about it she will tell you what happened when she tried this with me, because in all honesty it does not work, in the end i just got moved back because it resulted in so many arguements.      the fact is me isoloated = boredem + sadness = more disruption to entertain myself.        and he said he would talk to her about it, and if i sit there and work i can move back.      the thing is im kind of a sensitive and immature person, dependent on others eventhough i get good grades i dont have the self belief. i have bad concentration skills and dont cope well with dissapointment or bordem. so i dont know what more i can do.       like i said i know it is trivial and most people would not care but for some reason it really affects me.

20090304074348AA3mSNd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why do you think formula feeding became the norm?	I am not bashing formula feeding mommies, it's a personal choice and as long as your baby is healthy and happy that's all that really matters. But i was just wondering, i think it's because of the formula companies pushing it on people and because so many mothers work outside of the home now and it's just become so acceptable now, that it's expected. I don't hide the fact that i breastfeed, i am very open about it, when it's brought up at work. I had one lady look at me, why don't you go on WIC so you don't have to waste your time pumping? It's just funny, the way society view the two, why do you think that formula seems to be more accepted?

So I was pretty shocked to hear on the radio the other day that the age of people getting pregnant is going down to 26... I would have thought it to be a lot lower then that! I'm 21, and I have a son, which yes is kind of young, but all of my friends also have kids and have been married for a while, around here I would consider 26 so be a little on the later side to have a baby, what do you think about it?

I was just reading a Q from a young girl who is pregnant but not married she plans to bring her child up with the support of her partner but is being slated for being unmarried.  On the other hand you only have to watch the news or pick up a newspaper only to find some "expert" is saying we are having children too late in life.  Then you have the whole mothers in work mothers who stay at home argument, when again some so called expert tries to tell us what we should do for the best.  You can't eat this, don't drink that, don't give your kids this that and the other etc        Why can't we just be left to do what is best for us and our families?

20090304075145AASj6Xo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What would you honestly say or do?	My mother-in-law came over a few minutes ago.  She smokes and today she was reeeeeking of it.  My 2 and 1/2 week old was awake and she picked him up before I noticed how bad she smelled.        Long story short, my little tiny baby stinks of cigarettes to the point that I had to change his clothes and give him a sponge bath!      Would you say something?  I mean, I know it's just an odor and she always smells like something.  Usually she has on a ton of smelly lotion or perfume or something and that ends up getting on my kids but this cigarette smell had me pretty bothered.  Nobody wants their baby smelling like that!      What could I say to her?  I mean, she smokes.  I can't see telling her that she can't see the baby anymore until she quits smoking so I'm leaning toward just not saying anything at all because what can she do, but still.  That's nasty!  What would you do?

20090304081534AAjdqkk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2 year old throwing tantrums (not the normal "TERRIBLE 2's")?	I have two daughters, an 8 month old and a 2 year old. I started school October 2008 and decided to enroll my kids in daycare November of 2008.    When I became pregnant for my second princess, I lost my job. My oldest was 9 months old, from then on it was just me and her. No sitter, no daycare, no nothing. Im a single mother and didnt finish college so i decided to go back after having my second daughter. I enrolled them in to daycare my 8month old is obviously oblivious to the fact she's in daycare and is taking it fine. My two year old is regressing instead of PROgressing. From November till January my kids were both extremely sick and would only go from time to time. Now they're better and I've made it consistant. They HAVE to go to "school." Well, because I HAVE to go to school!   For two weeks my 2 year old was a dream, she'd say "i love you mommy. See you later" and we would all go about our days. After those two weeks, came the crying, then the screaming at the top of her lungs, then throwing herself on the floor... THEN throwing things (chairs, books, ect.) and NOW she's hitting, kicking, pulling hair, and biting. All this once i take off her jacket so i can leave. Its like everyday she has something new for us. I dont believe its the daycare, she comes home telling me how she likes her friends and loves her teachers. I'm 22 and I feel like i've tried everything. It's depressing me being alone and trying to do the right things. Is it normal? How can i help her? what should i do?

I sit her on it at least every half hour and also take her into the bathroom when I go to help her get the right idea. She has gone twice in the potty. But both times were #2 and she only went because we caught her in the act and swooped her to the bathroom. lol How can I make her go #1 or encourage her to go? Any suggestions?

What do other working moms do?  And could you show me your feeding schedule and how much they eat at once?  I have the "Super Baby Food" book, but some of the ingredients I've never even HEARD of, and the book pretty much tells you to go buy at least $200 or $300 worth of food to get started.  I can't afford that!  Does anyone have quick, easy, healthy meal ideas?  Is there a way to make a bunch of food in advance?  Since I don't get off until 6, it's going to be hard to find the time to cook.  My son goes to bed around 7:30, and we usually don't even get home from the baby sitters until almost 7!  I'm so worried, because it seems impossible to afford all the fancy food that book suggests, and impossible to find time to cook.  I do get 2 days off a week, so I can make food in advance, if that's possible.  Please, please, help me!
20090304072334AAl0POz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Problem at kid's doctors office! Help please!?	Before any of you leave hateful comments, I just want you to know that this is a religious belief and please do not leave hateful comments on here. I am needing constructive advice.      I have a 4 yr old son who I have been taking to the same pediatrician since he was born. No problems have ever arose but here the last month when I took him to the doctor they wanted to see his immunization record. Me and my husband are NOT immunizing our son due to religious beliefs(not because we are scared of autism or any of that) The pediatrician informed us RUDELY that if we wanted our son to continue to be seen in that practice that we had to give our son the shots. I am in complete shock at this time and I will not give in. I picked my things up and we left.       I think I need to call an attorney. This is religious discrimination. I don't think the doctor should be allowed to play God and tell me what I have to do with my son. I have a religious exemption on file so my son can get into school the next year but now his doctor refuses to see him. Is what they are doing legal? Can they deny my son the right to medical care because of my religious beliefs? PLEASE AGAIN, I don't need any one being mean because of my beliefs, that makes you just as stupid as his damn doctor.  Should I call my states discrimination hotline and an attorney? I live in Missouri by the way!!! Thanks again and God Bless.

20090304071828AAzwcZU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Northstar's question regarding a schedule?	So it is either she is Super Nanny in disguise, doesn't spend enough time with her kids, or she is just looking to pick a fight because not everyone does things as she thinks they should be done. Additionally, if we don't have a schedule is she saying that we are unhappy in our jobs as SAHM/SAHD? This question is completely worth spending 5 yahoo points on as I think she is a bit out of line to judge all of us by her standards. Who's standards is she judged by?
20090304080658AA5ZiPq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When will the line go!?	I gave birth 4 weeks ago, and I know it takes time for things to get back to somewhat normal. I'm wondering how long it took for your line on your belly  ("linea nigra" I believe it is called) It is still very dark, and my belly button is also gone really dark. I'm hoping my strech marks will fade abit too, do they? I was lucky not to get too many strech marks, mainly on my thighs and hips, will they lighten and maybe go white in time? My poor belly looks like a deflated balloon!!

20090304080953AAlCdMS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has anyone else had a problem like this with their baby?	My son is 9 months old, and at around 4 months old we realized he had two cysts at the roof of his mouth (in addition to his dermoid cyst) Well about a month ago we took him in to the doctor's because one of the cysts had turned from pink to a white and brown color and was hanging. They told us that it was from trauma and we were referred to a pediatric dentist. (trauma meaning constantly chewing on things caused this to happen) Well yesterday we went to the pediatric dentist.  She told us that this trauma is going to keep reoccuring if they are not removed. So she then referred us to an oral surgeon. Here in lies the problem. Every place we called said they will not take on a child this young. Earlier this morning I was freaking out because his cyst started to bleed, and luckily I got it to stop. What do we do? How do we get someone to operate?
20090304075552AAB73kx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can anyone think abortion is not a bad thing to do?	I am not christian so don't tag that to me. Abortion is a responsibility problem in the United States, with so many different types of contraceptive there is no reason anyone should get pregnant unless they really want to. Yes, I know there are accidents and there is rape and things like incess. That is where we need to regulate it and even if you or your girlfriend do get pregnant there is always adoption. You were a fetus once too so why not give someone else a chance at life. I was an accident and im also what my father is most proud of, people need to quit being lazy and sack up.

20090304080943AA7lEvd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Teen pregnancy, help?	My girlfriend and I were messing around and now we're not sure if she's pregnant or not.  If the worst were to happen and she is then she does plan to keep it, last night we discussed it and she said definitely not to a morning after pill and I agree.  Both of us are 18 and she is in college while I am still in high school.  So what do you think?   Well what happened was that we did not actually have sex.  I put myself in and she was willing, she is a virgin and I am not, but I got it half way in and stopped.  This happened for about three days in a row and we did proceed to mess around in the meantime.  The way that we think that she might’ve gotten pregnant was when we were messing around and I came on her, she was on top and I thought it all got on my chest but she told me that it all got on her but not directly in, maybe if anything just on.  Could she have that way?  I know that the probability is slight but both of us are really freaking out.  She’s sick and not feeling well at all, and now my mom knows and it’s only been five days so of course we can’t test yet.   Please I need some help with this, anything will be appreciated.

20090304072141AAXlwd4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm feeling completely miserable about my pregnancy.?	Usually when I'm feeling miserable about my pregnancy I like to get online and see how other women are handling pregnancy and stress at the same time.  I'm 21 years old, my husband and I had a beautiful wedding in August.  We ended up getting pregnant in October.  We were both extremely excited about having both our first child together. However, this pregnancy is such a nightmare to me.  I'm currently 17 weeks and 2 days pregnant.  I started to get sick around my 6th or so week and have felt this way ever since.  I get out of bed every morning knowing that 5 minutes later I will be leaning over the toilet. My headache starts up immediately.  I can quickly get a shower and get ready for work, but needless to say I'm not yet done being sick.  Sometimes I only make it to my kitchen and have to use the sink and get sick or sometimes I don't even quite get into the doors at my work and I get sick.  I feel nauseous all day long and I can barely eat because when I do I feel terrible in my stomach.  I try to eat because I know I have too.  I constantly have terrible stomach aches and I feel as though I could vomit all day.  After getting home from work I have a wonderful husband that tries to do everything possible to make me comfortable.  It's never enough though. When I start getting nauseated at home and even vomit I yell and scream the entire time saying " I can't do this anything, I just can't do this".  I smash my fist down and I've just about had it.  I've been to the Doctors now 3 times since finding out I was pregnant and once to the hospital.  At the hospital they have given me IV drip due to dehydration and I've my entire life had a potassium deficieny which isn't helping the baby.  They have given me a prescription for potassium, however I can't take the medication because I vomit very shortly after taking it. I've tried eating bananas and other such foods for potassium, but I get sick off of eating them too. I don't feel that I'm underweight due to this.  Since starting my second trimester I have not gained any weight, I have actually lost a few pounds.  When I got pregnant I started at 5'5" 135lbs.  I'm currently running around 127-130lbs. My OB/GYN continues to say everything is going okay, it's just unforuntanly you were one of the ones that continued to be sick.  My husband tells everyone he talks with and works with that he feels horrible that I have to feel this way.  I continue to say that I will never have another baby, knowing that the next time could be completely different, I don't think I could go through this again.  I'm just completely miserable about this pregnancy. I was hoping to enjoy everything about this, but I have not had one day yet that I've enjoyed.

20090304075822AA52xBJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What advice can I give my 10-year-old niece who is being picked on by a mean girl in school?	My niece just arrived at this school at the beginning of the school year.  She normally does not have trouble making friends or finding kids to play with.  A couple of weeks ago, she got into a little disagreement with one of her classmates over whatever 10-year-olds fight about and ultimately the little girl made my niece cry.  Now this particular little girl has decided to continue picking on my niece, by saying mean things about her and to her and spreading gossip around about her.  My one piece of advice to her was not to let that girl see her cry because that just fuels the flames.  Other than that, I have nothing more to offer.  Unfortunately, I was the one who got picked on in school and had no idea how to handle it then.  I just know it was horrible for me.  Does anyone have any advice I can give my niece to help her handle or even stop the situation before it gets too bad?

20090304080536AAnmiMn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How can I politely ask in-laws to cover their coughs around my kids?	My in-laws were visiting over the weekend. My father in law sounded congested when they arrived, and he coughed all weekend without covering his mouth. It really bothered me, since I have three very small children, but I didn't know what to say. My husband is usually good about bringing things to their attention, but I think he gets tired of constantly reminding them of their rude actions. (When they visit, they are often loud and leave stuff all over the place when they leave. My hubby has commented on it several times, with no improvement.) Now my middle child and I are both dealing with colds. I'm trying my best to keep the other two well, but I can't stop thinking about how this could have been prevented if my father in law had been considerate while he was here. What are some polite ways I can remind a grown man to cover his cough next time? (Hopefully there won't be a next time!)

20090304081607AA6z0g7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	6 yr old daughter/1st grade, sensitive but outspoken and anxiety?	My six year old has always had anxiety issues to some degree but I did not realize they were as bad as they were until I had a conference today with her teacher today.  She is very outspoken, you would never know that she had any issues, but if the teacher even points out (not in front of the other kids) that she did anything wrong on her paper, she cries hysterically, I guess this has been often at school, too.  I have gotten her past the crying all the time phase with me so I did not know she was doing it there, because she is always happy and says she had a good day.  Loves her teacher, has friends, etc.  She is having a harder time learning than my older daughter did.  I'd say she's middle of the class.  Oldest was always top of the class, but that's okay, trying to help her but she is stubborn, too.  She has needed glasses, so you would think that would have helped.  Seems like she hears things a little differently, too.  Like follow she hears fallow.  Anybody have anything like this?  It's not separation anxiety.  An example, my niece had a party at Build-A-Bear, they put her on the counter of the store and everybody sang to her and clapped.  My daughter would never get up on a counter and have everyone look at her singularly but she went to a camp this summer that put on a performance and she went on stage with other kids.  Also, would not do gymnastics at 5 when it was her turn, but did gymnastics this year and did great.  Help, I am at a loss of what to do for this kid.  It is affecting her learning.  Whenever she is out sick, she doesn't want to go back.  She is a routine kind of kid, does not like much change.

20090227062925AAig0lg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I have a dilemma, am I being too harsh?	My family is struggling financially, my mother is struggling financially. So we decided to merge finances and move in together and make the best of it until things get better. We’ve been with her for a week now and I’m trying VERY hard to be patient with my husband about all this.       We had a talk before we moved in and he said he wanted to be included in everything. At our own home, he would really only help with shower time. Everything else was all me. I ask for help but don’t get it so I stop asking because he sees it as nagging. I see it as being a parent/spouse and pitching in.       So I agreed I’d make sure to ask him to help me as opposed to asking my mother. Now he’s been laid off for 4 months and has had odd jobs but not steady work. Nor has he really looked. (My opinion, he feels differently) So the past few mornings since we’ve been at Mom’s house, he won’t get up when I ask him to. I already wake up at 5:30 am, make our son’s lunch, make coffee, set clothes out and by that time it’s 6:15 am. So I shower and just before I jump in, I ask him to get our son ready for daycare. When I get out of the shower, he’s still in bed. So I ask again as I get myself ready. He’s still in bed so then I just do it myself.      My Mom is up early so my son will go out and hang out with her. She’ll cook him breakfast and they have their little time together. She’ll help pack his bag, she’ll play with him, etc.       Then my husband strolls out of bed. Mom leaves for work, I head out to daycare. But my husband and I will fight all morning. And it’s driving me nuts!      I flat out told him that I don’t want to hear from his mouth that my mother is pitching in because the reason she is doing so, is because his lazy self is in bed. He COULD get up and help. Then it wouldn’t be an issue.       Am I being harsh here? And please don’t mention that he’s in a funk because he’s not. I’ve been quiet for 4 months now and it’s about time he finds a REAL job. He wants to move out of my Mom’s house and not live with her, well get a job so we can pay rent. I’m doing the best I can and I really can’t do much more. Except get myself a second job.

Im super hygeine conscious and wash my hands about 50 times a day and i have a antibacterial hand wash that you can use without water that i use at night when feeding her. I keep getting upset as her half sister comes round at weekends and has so much green snot up her nose it makes me want to puke and i panic that she is touching her. I think im a bit weird, but she had 2 colds about 4 weeks apart and it was awful to watch her at 3 weeks with a snotty nose a cough and sneezing. Anyone else as neurotic as me?

20090304092335AASP6kl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What to do about in-laws and birthday parties (warning, kind of long)?	My brother-in-law and his girlfriend have 5 kids, 4 daughters and a son. The youngest, who are twins, are 5.5, about 1.5 years older than my oldest child. I don't have any issues with the girls really, but the boy is very bad about trying to hurt my 3 and 4 year olds. He will chase them and push them down, he'll try to kick them, he tries to hit them with toys, and basically, I think he's a brat. His mom and dad don't even acknowledge it, even when I say something about it. I have said stuff to him directly, I have said stuff to his parents, and I have said stuff to my husbands aunt, who watches them all the time. He just spits at me, the parents ignore it, and the aunt says it's just "him being a boy".      No, my kids are boys, and they know not to behave like that. Normally, I'd just not go over there, but they have many parties that we are expected to show up to "because we're family". My husband and the other adults have a good time, and I'm stuck making sure this mini-devil isn't trying to hurt our kids. Now, my boys have a b-day coming up, and I feel bad about not wanting to invite them when they invite us. Plus, it's not the girls who do anything. So, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Invite just the girls? Or not even let them know about the party?      I just don't want to spend the day being baby-sitter when it's supposed to be MY kids' special day.      The boy is one of the twins, I should probably add that.

We have been blessed with the financial means to buy our own stuff, but they insisted in the matter as it's their first grandchild and I can understand that they are excited.      They wanted for me to set up a registry and although I'm not keen of registries at all and they know that (from my wedding), I did so to please them.  So i set two registries in Target and amazon.com      Now I get an email from my MIL saying that she wanted me to register in Babies r us as well. I think that 2 registries are more than enough and that babies r us is quite overpriced. She insists that people "want to" shop there.      What should I do? Keep the peace, give in and set up yet another registry or stick to my guns. I really do not want to offend anyone as they have been very supportive and generous and they are wonderful people.

And if she has gas she gets up about every hour (her doctor and I are working on that).    Well my questions are:   Do you think a baby sleeping threw the night is something that will happen on its own? When baby is ready?       Or do you think you have to train them to sleep? And if so what methods worked for you? (I will not let my baby CIO)       There are all sorts of sleep training books and stuff out there. I was just wondering if any of them actually worked for you or if they are a hoax's like so many other things.

20090304083435AAwb4WS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How quick can nipple confusion happen?	I gave my daughter a bottle of formula before my milk came in because I was exhausted and needed her to sleep a couple hours. The only time since my 4 month old has been given a bottle has been over the last three days. She has had an upper respiratory tract infection (AKA the common cold) that began with a fever. I gave her sterilized water in a bottle to prevent dehydration from the fever. She no longer has the fever BTW. She didn't really get anything out of the bottle, just wet her mouth and lips with it ~ sometimes getting a mouthful here or there. So she is now suffering from the congestion in her chest and nose associated with a "cold". It's hard to comfort her at night, she keeps spitting the boob out when normally it calms her instantly, and she makes this new weird sucking noise when latched on. I'm thinking she just feels crappy and is out of sorts but has anyone else had nipple confusion show it's nasty self after such small exposure to a bottle?

We took him to the ER (new mommy here) because the other day he had a 103 degree temp. The ER doctor didnt seem to know what the heck was wrong because he isnt congested, no cough, no runny nose. He thought it might be an ear infection and starting digging things out of his ear. My poor lil man was screaming, I just wanted to punch that DR, you can tell he didnt have kids, he referred to our son as "one of those".      I am not convinced its an ear infection, I am a first time mommy but he hasnt been tugging at his ears or anything. His temp is still around 101 right now but my Pediatrician said to keep him on Baby Motrin and if it doesnt subside by tomorrow to bring him in.      He goes from fine, a 98 degree temp to waking up at 1am screaming and burning up.

I don't feel like getting a paternity test because for one, I don't really care, and two, I don't even know how to find these guys anyway.      So, I'm thinking about just telling him that his father died before he was born. I have some pictures of an old boyfriend, and I was just thinking of saying that's his dad. I think it would be easier than telling him the truth. Does this sound like a good idea? Any opinions welcome.

We do want to have another (hopefully a little girl), but I just can't see a good time start trying in the future.      Let me explain.

20090304083312AAmYC8Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Prenatal Testing, Yes or No?	Okay so i'd like some opinions. Currently I'm almost 7 weeks. So maybe this is a little early, but I'm having a really hard time, on deciding whether or not to get prenatal testing done. The father wants me to , but I'm having second thoughts. Here's why, What if they are wrong, and I ruin the next couple months wondering, grieving, and not happy about being pregnant. Shouldn't it be a wonderful time. When my mom was pregnant with one of my little sisters, they said that she was going to have spinal bifida(sp?) and a chromosomal disease where all the organs are on opposite sides and she wouldn't live past 3 months. My mom thought that she was going to loose her child, after giving birth. She had a really hard time during pregnancy because of this, depression, pre term labor, and so on. So why should I put myself through that. What are the pro's of finding out now, what can I do differently if I find out something is wrong now. I'm still going to have the baby. So should I worry now, or be happy and see what happens when the time comes. Are there any tests in which they may find something that they can help prevent? Just some opinions of people who have and haven't got testing done. Thanks!

20090304083634AAPa2VA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Will too much sodium hurt my baby?	Last night my husband and I were making hamburgers for dinner. I mixed a pound and a half of ground beef with a tablespoon of A1, 1/2 tablespoon of Worcheshire and a tablespoon of seasoning mix. That alone was enough sodium for my liking. However my husband does the actual cooking so before he cooked the burgers he told me he put extra seasoning salt, salt and peper on top and a shot of A1 as well. The burgers were so salty they kind of gave my tounge that "burnt" feeling like when you try to eat something too hot. I was wondering if this is bad for my baby. I have read everything from it wont hurt the baby to it will dehydrate me and my baby to it can cause organ damage. Do any of you know any more information that could put my mind at rest? Thanks so much.

Children who have controllling/ overprotective parents do not know how to survive in the real world.   'Affected' children have a sense of nothingness in life particularly in early teenage years. They have had no say in what they want to do and just lose their inner voice completely.    Children lack confidence in their own personal abilities. (Not learnt via controlling parents)   They suck really, and need to be put in their place.       Mothers DONT always know what is best for their child, mine didnt and I grew up fine. I LOVE my independence, and hate it when almost full grown adults come up to me and say 'oh, but I cant my mum has just told me to.....' so crap really   ah moan over!

Any suggestions on what to do to get her to go without a fight?

Well out of all of em the 2 boys that i know of are not circumcised so this is new territory for me. Never thought i'd have a son so i never thought about this issue.

20090304082645AA96gBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does your reflux baby sleep on tummy?	Since Sunday night my 4 month old has not been sleeping well-she normally sleeps 9-10 hours.  When I put her in her crib now she starts grunting and kicking her legs like she is frustrated.  I propped her up on her side and she finally went to sleep.  Later I checked on her and she was on her tummy.  On Monday we went to the MD for her checkup and he said she would be rolling over soon and I couldn't stop her from sleeping on her belly then.  She's been doing it every night since, all night crying and kicking her legs.  Last night, or this morning at 4 I finally rolled her on her stomach and she was out like a light.  She lifts her head fine and is already in the jumperoo and exersaucer.  It seems that is the only thing she wants, to be on her tummy.  I have heard acid reflux babies are this way.  Does your reflux baby sleep this way?  She is already medicated for reflux, is not teething, didn't have gas, and wasn't cold.

20090227063503AAOGiqc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have a sixteen year old stepson. What should I do when he behaves naughty? Should I spank him?	I definitely believe that you should spank your children. I don't care if they are teenagers or grown up men with children; you need to put your hand to their bottom! I spank my sixteen year old son and his friends (their parents are FULLY aware of this), but would it be awkward if I tried to spank my step son? I've seen him naked, so there's no worry about that one. We are a close family. It's just that...I don't want to cross the line. His step mom is dead and his father (my husband) will only let me spank the children, but he watched. Advice, please?

20090304090212AAkiYJk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would you deal with defiance?	I am looking after my neice (for reasons that I don't want to go into. Also please don't slag off my sister it's not her fault.) Anyway I'm not a mother myself and I've found it very challenging looking after my 5 year old neice.       She is very hyperactive and doctors have said they want to test her for ADHD next year (No clue why they are waiting a year) and she is very defiant and stubborn.      Like for example she was running around in a vest and shorts yesterday (which she had put on herself after school) and I asked her nicely if she would put on something more appropriate for the weather prehaps a long sleeved top and some trousers. She shouted at me No! I asked her again nicely. After about 10 minutes she was still in the vest I started to bribe her into putting on warmer clothes (she was cold to touch and it was very cold outside) I said I'd turn the TV off until tomorrow if she didn't. She continued to refuse shouting no at me whenever i even tried to start a sentence. I got mad and she got mad and she was shouting at me. I said if she didn't put on warmer clothes I would make sure she didn't get to hold the hamster and she said "Right that's it. I'm calling the police on you" and she picked up the phone I grabbed the phone of her before she dialled 999.       There have been similar behaviours with her helping herself to food. Refusing to go to school. Refusing to dress sensibly. Refusing to eat her dinner (unless she chose it. the kind of meals she wants are ice cream and jelly. consequently she doesn't get a say in evening meals.) Running about indoors, shouting, opening the front door and letting the dog out.      I'm at my wits end. Like i said, I'm not a mother and I don't have any instict. I don't know what to do with her. She calls herself "The Boss" and she really is. I know it sounds terrible but I find myself just letting her get on with it. If I try and tell her off she slaps, bites or kick me and she shouts at me a lot. I'm a single 21-year-old with no previous experience with children. Kayleigh has made my mind up I am never having kids!! Seriously though, I  don't want to hand her to the social but I can't go on living like this. Any tips from Mums would be so gratefully appreciated I cannot tell you. Thank you for reading this. Sorry its so long.

20090227063846AAIUBtU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Can I be a good mom AND work full-time?	Hello everyone! My husband and I are expecting our first baby (a girl) on or around May 1. I will be on paid maternity leave for 6-8 weeks and then using 6 weeks of my vacation time on top of that for a total of about 3 months home with our new baby girl. I'm struggling with wanting to be a SAHM and also wanting to work. I'm the primary breadwinner in our home and I love my job. My husband has a great job too. We have considered relocating from Virginia to FL or NC (where cost of living is lower) to be able to afford for me to stay at home. With the state of the economy, there's no way I'd feel comfortable giving up my job and I am not even sure I am the type of woman who wants to stay home! My question is, can I be a good mother and still work full time? (My mom didn't start working until my youngest brother started school). I'm afraid of my baby girl growing more attached to her nanny than to me. My job is completely flexible as well. I can choose to work from home whenever I want and my employer stands behind a good work-life balance. Has anyone else struggled with this? What did you decide to do?      Thanks! =)

As an act of discipline, I am having my son repay us for some damage he caused while he was having a temper tantrum.  I do not want him to give us his money to pay us back because money doesn't mean anything to him and my children always get a ton of cash at Christmas, birthdays, etc.  I told him he needs to pay me back in labor, but I wanted it to be like piece labor where he will be granted $1 for doing a certain amount of something (like collecting one bucket of pinecones from our front yard to the garbage).  The problem is: I can't think of what this something would be!  It is winter right now so it needs to be something in the house?

20090227063654AAyPbHG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it normal for a baby to be sick so often?	My 8 month old has just picked up yet another sickness bug. This is the fourth time in 3 months and each time throws everything he eats back up for a day and then has diarrhoea for about a week. During this time he will not touch solids but has plenty of formula and water.  We do go to play groups about twice a week to meet my mummy friends so I think he's picking germs up there.      I spoke to my health visitor who said that viral infections are common during the winter months and as long as he's well hydrated, there's no need for concern.      I'm really worried that he's not getting enough nutrition as his feeds are passing through so quickly and he's been poorly so often. Will this affect him in the longer term? My mother in law says I should keep him away from play centers altogether until he is older but he loves mixing with other babies and we both enjoy getting out for a change of scenery. Does this sound a bit obsessive? I've started carrying anti-bacterial wipes with me when I go out to clean high chairs and seats etc.

We have been living together for a year, all is really good, we have discussed and planned to get engaged in the next two months (some level of romantic surprise) and married next spring.  I just took a new job with a start up and my coverage lapsed while I researched individual coverage.  Yes, I realize that was a mistake.  And, now, this.       So, if I am pregnant, could we do the legal marriage thing to get me covered?  With most large corporate health plans, if I were added as a spouse would the pregnancy be a preexisting condition?
20090304085123AAsU95X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Need some advice from moms?	I have two kids, one is two years, and the other is about 5 months. I've been a stay at home mom for almost a year now, since I found out I was pregnant last year.      I'm not wanting to go back out and start my career as a musician. I've even got a audition for a band that does travel the southern east coast (From Virginia to around Georgia). They're about to hit the recording studio in a couple weeks, which at that time I would be able to join them.      I'm really excited because this is a big opportunity for me, but also feeling a bit guilty because it would mean time away from my family. I know this is a big shot, because not only a big opportunity, but also a chance at helping give my family a better financial future. But it does mean I'll miss a lot of things for my family.      It's a constant battle I've fought for a while, considering my husband kinda steered me to be a stay at home mom.       I would love to include my children in practices, considering my daughter LOVES music, and I would love my childern to involve music in their lives.       What advice can you moms give me? Has anyone else been in this situation before due to school, job or something else?
20090227064112AA4czwt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What would you do if you started everyday by talking yourself out of having an abortion?	Every single day I have to wake up and talk myself out of getting an abortion. I know that it's wrong, but I just don't even want to go through with this pregnancy. My baby is mixed. My extended family is very racist. I know that telling them would ruin my relationship with them. That is consistently running through my head. Along with, my mom has absolutely no patience for children. She is also an alcoholic and the only one that can help me. I have no money as of right now and I'd have to work  my *** off in order to even be able to have enough stuff to bring my baby home from the hospital. I am currently living at home where my aunt and uncle have co-signed on my mothers house. They believe that they have a say over who lives here. I know that they would not be supportive of me living here with my child. I barely have enough money to buy the things a baby needs. I highly doubt I would have enough money to get into an apartment. Besides, my mom would try to kick me out every other day, which would highly irritate me. I don't know what to do, so everyday I wake up and desperately try to talk myself out of having an abortion. What should I do?

It goes in phases, sometimes I'm okay and other times I'm not.  I think part of it is because with this pill I dont really get my period, its a common side effect, but I haven't had a single other problem with it so I don't want to switch because I've had bad experiences with others (weight gain, skin probs, etc).

I haven't done anything since December yet it's February and I still haven't started my period. I'm scared and wondering could I be pregnant.
20090227063435AAKe6VC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 3 months pregnant and I have 8 month old twins and my husband is being very cold with me lately. Help?	My husband and I have been married a little over a year and have 8 month old twins and I'm now 3 months pregnant with our 3rd child. We had a tough time in the beginning of our relationship including him canceling our first wedding and other issues with his parents being against our relationship. We ended up getting married when I was late into our first pregnancy and our marriage was fine til I told him I was pregnant again. He has been coming home late from work and getting easily upset when our twins get fussy. He also hasn't wanted to be intimate with me for the last 3 weeks and I think it's because I've put on extra weight. I try talking to him but he just brushes me off. I'm wondering if this is just because all of the stress of things happening to soon, or could he really be angry because I'm gonna have this baby?
20090227063733AAifO3k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Implantation Cramps and other slight symptoms?	I've been having some slight cramping for the past few days.  My last cycle started January 29th.  So, I know I could test now, but my cycle has been inconsistant since my D&C last Fall.  I'm trying to wait another week because I'm tired of thinking I could be because I miss my period, but every other month it turns out that I'm just late.  I'm trying to hold off until next weekend to test.        Anyways, I do have slight cramps, which normally just before my period starts I have cramps maybe the day before but notice them right before I start and that's it.  These have lasted a couple days now.  I have CM each day which I usually only have that near ovulation and each morning I wake up feeling slightly bloated even though I haven't eaten much for dinner (or drank much) the night before.        I know this is a stupid thing to post because only a test is going to tell me for sure.  I was trying to tell myself I didn't want to get pregnant this month, I would rather get pregnant now in April and avoid holidays, but now that I am just a bit late, again, lately, not surprising, I'm starting to get my hopes up again and really don't want to because I'm afraid I will be disappointed yet again.  And of course I'm tired of wasting the tests for it to tell me I'm not.  :)  However, I'm definitely no where near the most patient person in the world.      Did anyone else have slight cramping that lasted a few days and feeling a bit bloated?  Thanks.

20090227063904AAU7OrT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Would their be any physical damage if a 10 year old were to give birth?	I'm am doing an informative paper about why abortion should never be abolished based off of the fact that girls under the age of 16 get raped and those young girls should have the option to get an abortion. Please do not post just because you don't agree with my views. Point blank, if a 10 year old were to get pregnant would their or could their be physical damage to that child? And yes a 10 year old can get pregnant you have a chance of pregnancy the first time you have your menstral (the youngest mother ever was 5).

20090304083431AAgP4PA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS TOY? TEN POINTS!?	When I was a little girl I can recall a toy that I played with a lot. I do not know the maker of the toy, so I will try to describe it to the best of my abillity. It was a small plastic church, inside of the church was tiny light that actually lit up. There was a groom with blonde hair wearing a light blue/gray jacket and pants. The bride had a short veil and white gown.  She also had blonde hair. There was a purple key that come with the church and you could unlock the church from the back to open the church. The key also had a magnet on the end of it and if put under the church, the key could move the bride and groom around.     This toy would have been made in the late 80's early 90's. The reason I am asking in the toddler section is because I plan to purchase this again somehow so that my daughter can enjoy it the way that I did.     growing up, I had an abusive step father who through the majority of my toys away, he through them in the sewer. He through the ones away that he knew I loved so much.     Thank you for your time and any information or links are greatly appreciated!

20090304085512AAXP45S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Octamom! Why is it wrong for her? What about the mothers that did this in the 50's...a child every 9 months.?	In the 50's and 60's, it was common for families to get pregnant and have a baby every 9 1/2 months.  It's almost the same thing.  Why is it so wrong for this woman.  People need to get a life.  She needs a little help at home and there wouldn't be much of a difference than the way it was a long time ago.  She's now doubting her confidence because of all of this negativity -- which are opinions of a bunch of people that have their own issues that we can judge.  Only God can judge us so give it a break.  Look at pictures of big families from 30 and 40 years ago.  Why do we not compare this to that...it was all the rage.  So shut up Cher, Dr. Phil and whoever else has a comment and doesn't look back at the catholics (I'm catholic) having one child after the next.  Why is this different?!  Oh, I know... because the media has no other news to share and so they've focused on her and now everyone is better than this woman.  Really?  I don't think so.

Afterwards the doctor used the sonogram to check on the baby.  We did not hear the heart beat.  At first she said that there might be something wrong with the pregnancy.  But then she said to just wait 1 or 2 weeks to see what happens.  So now I'm just soo confused.  Is it normal to not hear the heartbeat at 6 to 7 weeks pregnant?  Is it normal for a doctor to tell you there might be something wrong and then say "well lets just wait another week or so"?  Have any of you ever experience something like this?

My sister and I were talking the other day about how hard her life is with her kids. She has a 7 year old and a set of twins (2 1/2 year olds) She says her life is really hard because of her bf. They've been together a really long time but he treats all of them like crap. When he gets mad at her he takes it out on the kids calling them names and saying they aren't his kids. She also says they're a handful. She also told me the saddest thing, she said that if she had the chance to take the twins back she would! and she'd just stay with the oldest girl. I said to her that was awful. She said "I'd do it only if I can go back in time and I wouldn't know about it" I still think it was a really bad thing to say OR think about. What are your thoughts about this? I know life is hard and sometimes I feel the same with my daughter but only because I regret bringing her into this *****d up world. Other than that I can't see my life with out her anymore. It feels like she's been always there I couldn't imagine "taking her back" I wouldn't! Would you?

20090304103844AALc0P5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How Can I Add Non-Dairy Healthy Fat and Calories Into My 12 Month Old's Diet?	My son is 12 months old and we learned at his 1-year check-up that he has fallen off the growth charts.  He is 17lbs, 15oz and 28".  At 6 months he was in the 10th percentile for weight.  At 9 months he was in the 3rd percentile for weight.  Now, at 12 months he's not even on the charts!  We will go back for a 15 month check-up to monitor his progress and the doctor stressed that I need to try to get him to gain weight.      He is allergic to dairy (he has got hives in the past from yogurt).  My doctor suggested I just try him on the homogenized milk to see if he's grown out of the allergy, but he hasn't.  I tried giving it to him on 3 different days and he's thrown it up every time within 5 minutes of drinking it.  We go back to the doctor on Tuesday to get a referral to the pediatric allergy specialist.      In the meantime, what are some ways that I can add healthy fat and calories into his diet to help him gain weight?  He can't have any milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, etc.  Nothing dairy.  He is also allergic to soy.  Also, his Dad has a severe nut allergy so I need to stay away from all nut products.      Right now he is on a special infant formula and likes to eat things like beans, hummus, fruit, vegetables, bread, etc.      Any ideas would be very much appreciated!  Thank you!
20090304100658AAOrBwt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you sometimes need "reminding" that it is okay...?	To buy yourself some clothes, etc sometimes as well?       If you are guilty of this like I am, does your SO remind you of this, and maybe even set up a day where he/she can watch the kids so you can go do this on your own? So that maybe the temptation will not be so strong to go for clothes, etc for them instead of yourself!

20090304111634AA82hR4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Help Please. A P7 girl has been GROPING P2 boys.....?	Hello. I really need advice. My son is 6 years old and in primary 2 in the UK. Today he told me that a primary 7 girl came into the wee ones playground (the older kids have a separate playground) and asked him if she could touch his friends privates. Because my son is only 6 he didn't understand how serious this was, he laughed it of and shrugged "yeah, I spose so!". So this girl touched another wee boy. I asked him if she touched him and he said no but says she kissed another 6 year old on the lips.      He thinks the whole thing is rather funny and innocent and I can't explain to him why it isn't. My Q is, don't you think a 11/12 year old give should know better? I mean, she does know this is wrong surely? I already phoned the wee boys mum to have a chat about it but she didn't answer. Should I tell the head mistress? Am I over reacting? I think im shocked because the girl is so old. If it had been a 6yr old girl I would know that she didn't understand what she was doing but I think this P7 is a pervert and I don't want her groping my child. What do you think?      Much appreciated, thanks for reading.

I'm not going to breastfeeding, i'm going to be expressing my milk into bottles then bottle feeding.      I've been told that it would be hard for a day or 2 because you're producing colostrum, not milk so it'll be thick and hard to pump.      I was thinking about just formula feeding for the day or 2 until my milk is ready to come out normally, then i can express my milk.       Would this be ok to do? I mean, would my milk dry up if i don't pump it or breastfeed the day and day after giving birth? Would my baby take the bottle if the milk tastes differently?      All advice would be great, please don't say " breastfeed for the first few days because the colostrum is so good for them " i've not completely made up my mind yet, i'm just thinking about options of what i can do.
20090304104912AAvcjAt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	ARGHH another breastfeeding question, sorry guys!?	I was originally planning pumping my milk into bottles then feeding that way, so my son was getting the best start but without the need of sucking my nipples.      I hate my nipples being touched or stimulated, i hate touching them myself so i can't imagine a baby being latched onto them every couple of hours. That might sound ridiculous but that's how i feel.       So if i do try breastfeeding and it works for me e.g. i don't feel sick when he's sucking my nipples then i will do it.      I do however have a few more Q's.      If i am to breastfeed, what happens when i go out into public, i was told that i can't use breast and bottle e.g. express milk and breastfeed because the baby won't take to the breast after it's sucked a teat.       HELP!?       Sorry for being annoying with these questions, i'm just a little confused and want to get it sorted out in my head so i know what i'm doing.

While I was talking to him my daughter thought it was funny to pull up at the nearby table and throwing things off it.  I popped her hand and told her no.  I think the noise scares her because she started to cry.      This man however, felt the need to ask "You hit your child?"  I told him I discipline my children.  I don't see anything wrong with it.

She is now 6 months old and my concern is when we do switch to whole milk in 4-6 months, will she have a problem? My husband nor I have any issues with dairy. My doc suggested the soy when she was 3 weeks old b/c she had a hard time digesting the regular, sensitive, or gentle. Did anyone switch back to regular formula or gentle to make the transition later to whole milk easier or does this make it easier? I also had a question about adding other dairy products. My daughter is just starting some stage 2 foods and she is doing great, I would like to eventually introduce yogurt since I eat a lot myself. When should I do that? I have read the whole milk unflavored yogurt is ok around 6-7 months but I am afraid she will have problems. I am just looking for people experiences etc. THANKS!

20090304100311AApJ2TC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Almost there....Breastfeeding and pumping question?	Good Afternoon Mommies,   As you know I ask alot of questions on here because I love the feedback that I get from you intelligent moms. So..Lets update you on me.This is my first pregnancy. I am 29 weeks and 5 days pregnant with a little girl. We are going to name her Yosselyn. I am planning on breastfeeding(breast only at home) but I am planning on pumping my milk for public places. Now the question......What bottles/nipples should I buy. I don't want her to get confuse and want the bottle more!  I don't want her to want breast more because of public places! How do I know which ones? I am on a limited budget so I don't want to go out and buy one of each! How did you cope with breastfeeding/pumping/bottlefeeding your newborn?

20090304103530AAyOOYC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My son had tubes in his ears...How long will this last?	My 2-year old son had tubes put in his ears last August.  Before the tubes, he was sick with ear infections CONSTANTLY.  I was taking off work to care for him at least once a month, usually more than that.  After the tubes, he's only been sick for respiratory problems due to his reactive airways disease, but he is not sick as often as he was with the ear infections.      Well, the job I had that was so good about allowing me to be off with my son is closing it's doors.  I was laid off Monday.  My biggest fear is that the tubes will fall out and he'll start up with the ear infections again.  When I find another job, I'm sure I won't be lucky enough to have an employer that will be so accommodating as to let me be off with my son as often as my last employer.        Can anybody tell me if they've had tube put in their child's ears and how things went afterwards?  Did you have problems with the tubes fell out?  Thanks for anything you can share!

20090304104050AAeCi9q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	CD 31, 11-13 DPO.... What do you think?	Hey ladies... Well, I have gone back and forth between the idea of thinking I'm pregnant or not...Right now, I'm leaning towards not. Here is what I tracked this cycle:      LMP: Feb 2nd   Possible Ovulation: Feb 19-21st (not sure which exact day)   3-5 dpo: Had period like cramps that lasted a day and a half, then slowly went away   7-9 dpo: Starting feeling really sick and nauseated all the time. Had sore boobs, a "pinching" feeling in my lower abs, headaches, and sneezing (yes, I heard that can be a symptom)      I have also had awful heartburn the last few days, which I have never in my life had before. I'm just afraid that all of this is in my head...      The thing that has me leaning towards NOT pregnant right now is from checking my cervix. It has been high, then low, then high, then low since ovulation. But has been closed the whole time. Yesterday when I checked it was low and open. It felt firm right in the middle but soft and sort of "mushy" around the edges. Sorry for TMI. I just would really like some input or just to hear your experiences. Thanks ladies!!! Best of luck!!!!         TTC #1 for 5 months.

20090304111441AAbaVwO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Help!  My friend got arrested!?	She is 16 years old and she got arrested on Thursday for starting a car fire on that same day.  She started the fire at her own house.  Me and my friends think she did this to get back at her dad b/c she does not get along with him and b4 this, she starting staying after school longer and i think it was to get away from him.  I saw her house while driving to school(about 2 hours later) and her dad's trailer(which he uses for work) was burned on one side and i think that one side of the tires were melted and the front of the garage was burned and the siding was melted.  I read in the paper that she caused about $75,000 of damage.  What you have to understand is that this is not normal of her.  for her to do something like this, she would have had to have just snapped.  I am not sure where she is, but i think she is probaly in juvi or in the metal health hospital.  I am not sure if she is coming back bc the vp took the books out of her locker but all of her things are still there.  I am really worried about her and i just hope her dad will not press charges against her.  Will she have to do jail time if her dad does not press charges and if so how much?  If he does not press charges will she still have to and for how long?   thank you for your help, i am just so worried about her

20090304112259AAanjjo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Will 5 month old learn to be interested in solids?	My son is a little over 5 months old.  We have started him on some limited solids (rice cereal, fruits, etc) per his doctor's recommendation -- he is already over 20 lbs and seems very interested in our food -- but he doesn't seem to like eating solids much.  He acts interested in food -- he watches every bite we take and makes chewing motions with his mouth when he sees his spoon coming -- but most of what goes in his mouth comes back out, and he turns his head away and/or starts fussing after only a few bites.  Should I stop for a few weeks and then try again later, or keep forcing the issue?  I'm afraid if we force it when he's not interested, he'll learn to hate food, but if we let it go and keep waiting, he'll never learn to eat!  What should I do?  Thanks!

20090304095423AAFvNZS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 8 month old baby whinges all the time and cries in her sleep all night?	For the last 5-6 weeks now she always seems to whine and moan all day. The only time she doesn't is if she's feeding or you are playing with her. I can't seem to get anything done and my washing pile is like Mt. Everest! We can't feel any teeth coming but she does chew on her hands and toys a lot and we have given her teething gels and toys, I give her liquid ibuprofen all the time but this doesn't seem to work. This last week she has especially been upset and really cries 'real tears' (and her cry is different to her usual whinge) when you leave the room. I do feel really sorry for her, but i'm not sure of the problem and i'm at breaking point. She also used to be a really good sleeper, but up until 5-6 weeks ago she also really cries and moans in her sleep. She will probably sleep for 2 hours first and then be constantly waking up crying all night.    She had her immunisations very late as the nhs had messed up sending out her appointments and I had to mither the doctors myself, so she has had her 12 week and 16 week injections within 8 weeks. Her last injection was 3 weeks ago

I am happy that I get to spend quality time with my son, but I am unsure of how much quality time I should spend playing, reading, and doing craft and such. He wants me to play with him all day, (He is 3 years old). But of course I need to do chores (cooking, cleaning, showering, etc.). I feel guilty when I tell him I am busy. So I am just wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how much time to set aside each day for playing with him and what to say when I am busy. Right now I am stopping about every half an hour to play a game or do an activity for about 30 mins, and also I have set a side a couple of hours a day to go to the park or swimming. Is this enough? Thank you for the help!

20090304100705AA9b6nh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Opinion if safe to work two jobs while pregnant?!?	I'm 20 weeks pregnant. I work two jobs---and I'm 23 years old. MON-FRI I work 9am-5pm (1st job) and 6pm-11pm (2nd job). I dont get much sleep except on the weekends. Is this safe or harmful? So far, I am not having any complications. I'm trying to pay off my credit cards before I have my baby which I've paid off 5 credit cards already and have 3 to go. I'm not gonna free-load from the government and will not get any help from them. I'm going through my insurance and I'm paying my deductible of $1500. As far as the dad, he will help whenever he can but MY bills are really not his problem. They are mine which I'd like to take care of first. Should I do that or save up for the baby? I'd like to know peoples opinions on working two jobs while pregnant or if I'm a strong individual trying to handle things that I could get help from. I dont know. My first job I'm sitting down, the second I'm a cashier and on my feet. Any advice would be helpful. OH and I'm drinking more than a liter of water a day, I dont drink cokes, but I am eating junk food (because a salad wont get me through the whole day). I dont get sickness and I'm not in bad moods. Any advice will be helpful. Thanks for reading.

I started what I though was a normal period on Feb 21st through the 26th, and then a few days later started bleeding heavily.  I went in to see the doc and she said it was possibly just a messed up cycle. I only had one shot and a month before I got it I had a 16 week miscarriage.  So my dr put me on yaz, the birth control pill for a month to help regulate my cycles.  I've heard that this sometimes works.        Does anyone know anything about this?  Has it worked for anyone??  I really would like to have a baby...
20090304101216AAuMXGg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did my Amniotic Sac really rupture?	I am about to be a first time mother... I woke up at 330 to use the restroom and as I went felt a huge rush of fluids that I could not control. Needless to say that woke me up real fast. I called my husband who rushed home to take me to the hospital. As I got things ready to go I began to feel what I thought to be contractions getting a bit stronger. Once I got to the hospital and all hooked up to the monitors the resident did a fern test to detect fluid and it showed up to be nothing... He said it hadn't ruptured. I was heart broken as I though my little girl was on her way... The Nurse said it may still be possible and her head might be cutting off the canal to release any more fluids. I still think I feel little "trickles" when I use the restroom but am not leaking at all. My contractions aren't strong at all but are there. They feel like muscle spasms and she starts squirmming. Am I crazy or did it really rupture? I will be 39 weeks on Saturday and a week ago I was 1CM 100%....

20090304104105AAfAEzQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question about e.p.t. pregnancy test - It showed negative before I used it?	I had the test for two weeks still in the box, I got it out today to use it and when I opened it, it already had a light blue negative in the +/- round circle window and the square that indicates its working correctly was blank.      I used the test and the square showed a bright blue line showing it was "supposed" to be working correctly, but the round circle with the light blue negative never changed.      Was it faulty or is it supposed to be like that before it is used? I did notice a small hole in the foil wrapper and my bathroom gets very humid when we shower, don't know if that would affect it or not.

20090304111522AAvfLzh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Tell me more about low birth weight infants b/c of exposure to narcotic pain meds?	I would love to get anyone's knowledge / experience with low birth weight infants born in 5% weights because of exposure to narcotic pain meds. I have a chronic pain condition & was pre-prego took muscle relaxers (flexeril), neurontin (nerve controling pill) & morphine around 30mg a day. Upon learning of my pregnancy (2 wks prego) I stopped the use of all these medications & the specialists switched me to methadone (15 mg daily on a good day) to (25mg daily on a bad day). I am in my 20week and all imaging shows baby is growing at a healthy normal pace & is free of anyother known / detectable syndrome (clef or down syndrome). I was told that at my 32nd week mark they would do a growth ultrasound to determine if the baby was growing at a normal pace. The doctor & specialist said that usually in the 3rd trimester if something is wrong w/ the baby's growth it would only be detectable then, b/c there would be a clear dropoff only during the end. If they baby is in the 5% & growth is shown to have slowed they would need to do an early delivery b/c the baby in this situation would grow more normally outside the womb. I am now really worried & hoping & praying I can stick to my low dosage (good days) of 15mg of methadone for the remainder. I am wondering if that will help? I am also wondering how low of a chance this is? Comments or experience with early delivery b/c f slow growth?

I never get hormonal when my period comes around or breast tenderness or anything. So why does it keep coming early? Am I pregnant? By the way it's not implantation bleeding, it's definitely a period. It lasts 5 days.
20090304121921AAxP5VO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Is Comrade a cool name for a boy?	I used to know a guy named Comrade.    (pronounced Kom-rad. The "e" is silent)    Then he moved.       I'm getting married soon, and we've been talking about boy names. We've been going over names of guys and girls we have known for references. I was wondering if Comrade is a wierd name for a baby boy in your opinion. What do you think?
20090304115236AAkSAXG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How accurate is ultra scan in predicting the baby's gender?	Last week when i had my big u/s at 20w5d, the tech said i was having a girl after alot of difficulty in measuring the baby's body.(though we all expected it to be a boy, but glad for either of them). and said the baby was in breech position and could not able to measure the spine...Told me to walk for 10 minutes..And when i came after doing some little walk, the tech said still the baby was not in a right position to let the spine measured..I thought how she was able to tell the gender when she said the baby was not positioned right to see everything..and also when i saw the u/s screen, it was soo blurred, i couldnt even find out what she was showing me.. though i was again asked to come for another u/s on March 11th..Just wondering if she was accurate in telling that it was a girl...   Throw some of ur experiences ladies,,   Thanks

20090304115804AA5CdHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why does my 2 and 1/2 years old daughter keep saying her bottom hurts?	For the past couple of weeks my daughter who is 2 and 1/2 years old off and on has been saying her bottom hurts, I tell her to point where and she points by her butt hole.  I rub vaseline, butt paste, eucerin aquaphor, and i guess it soothes whatever is bothering her.  But she still says it hurts.  I checked there is no scratches, no chafe, no red, no soreness.  I always powder her bottom cause she is still a bit toddler chubby.  I asked her why it hurts and she says "gum is stuck in it."  I think she tells me this because she swallowed a piece of gum my husband gave her and we told her don't do that or it will get stuck in your butt" jokingly of course but she took it literally.  I thought it was constipation, which it might be, because she often poops every 2 days and sometimes the poops  are big and hard and that's when she says it hurts but sometimes even after the poops on random days she says it hurts.  Do you think I should tell the doctor she told her preschool teacher and the teacher said she started to tear up, which means its bothering her?? Any one have any ideas??

20090304122604AA5Cc5Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Concerned about My 4 Month Old's Development?	My Daughter is 4 months old. She was born 3 weeks early, and the best thing I could have ever asked for. My Question is...   She sems to have hit most of her early milestones on time. She sits up with little support. Is eating cereal no problem...laughs...smiles...all that cute baby stuff :) But when it comes to using her hands or rolling over she seems more interested in stuffing her hands in her mouth every chance she gets. Yet she will not use them to grab or swat at toys. She's also not rolling over yet. She can go from back to either side, but then gets frustrated and quits. So does this seem normal? I know she understands how to get her hands to her mouth, and gets the basic concept of them, but is it normal for her to still not be interested in using them otherwise? Do I have reason to be concerned? Any advice would be appreciated!   Thanks!

If I pay more than 75-90% of my cost of living ect.?	in arkansas you have to be 17 to get emancipated...      1. Am 17   2. Am a high school senior   3. Work 2 jobs (one is an internship for IT)    4. I pay for everything doc bills, gas, cell, insurance ect. everything but rent-all i do is sleep and shower at my parents house.    5. Truck is in my name and paid off in full (becasue I was 16 at the time my father cosigned for insurance purposes..)   6. my parents already agree i pay for myself      If i started paying rent can I get emancipated status? since I pay for what 90% right now anyway..how much should I be charged? .this could really help on the FASFA amount since when I move out straight after graduation i can fix up my grandparents basement help them since they cant find a decent nurse or aid, get job and to to tech school two days a week... college is on me so no help just grants ect hopefully can by pass the loans tho but will do if have to   6 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.

I don't know how many HPTs i must have done but they all came out negative. then on the 16th of Feb i had lower abdominal discomfort and on the 18th of Feb i had dark brown stringy discharge and i thought 'how could my Periods be here, its only been 27 days!' and then this discharge continued for like another day and was light pink and then went clear. I took another HPT and negative...did i test too soon. All this while my CM was sorta wet and slippery and then went on to become milky. We had unprotected sex again on the 28th of Feb......i took an HPT like 2 days later...negative...am i testing too soon?...and I'm so hoping I'm pregnant...i feel sorta tired most of the time...but thats about it...when should i test again???...what is happening with my body and i sooooooo want another baby ( I already have a 2.5 year old baby boy) Help me please!!!

20090304120240AA4FGcK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	1 month old baby acting strange?	Well last night allison started not acting like herself. She constanly kept crying I trying changing holding positions, lay her down and she still would keep crying. I tryed giving her pacifier to her and she didnt want it, I tryed giving her bottle to her and she didnt want that either. She just kept crying I didnt no what to do cause everything I tryed doing wouldnt help. I checked her diaper and everything. When she would cry she would kick her legs around really hard, also when I would touch her hand she would grib really hard to my finger while crying and kicking her legs. We dont have a thermometer so we couldnt check her temp my hubs said she felt fine. She has been farting alot I was thinking maybe shes gassy? Her poop has been changing off and on one day its clumpy (constipation) and the next it will be soft. I dont no why shes on the same food and same ammount everyday. Also when shes starts drifting off to sleep her eyes roll up... Is that normal? I noticed when she was sleeping she would open her eyes and they would roll back its like shes dreaming but im not to sure if she is or not. Today shes been crying..Yes i know babies cry..BUT she stops crying when I pick her up..But since last night if i pick her up she keeps crying she doesnt stop  Should I call her doctor? I have no idea what I can do for her. Anyone eles have this happen to there baby? I was up ALL night cause she was making noises in her sleep and i was worried about her to so I didnt sleep last night im exhausted.

20090304120327AAdY1Qa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Best friend problem, help?	Okay well I used to be friends with this really nice and caring girl and well we came to high school and she's dramatically changed. I'm pretty popular and whatever so it's not like i'm desperate to be here friend it's just that I trusted her a lot and i thought the feeling was mutal. Anyways all of a sudden she's acting as though she's better than me....whenever she's around other kids(ones i don't really hang with) she acts totally different...more like fake actually. she laughs all fake around them and throws around hugs and kisses between them...it's kinda pathetic really because when she's around people she'd known for a long time, she doesn't act all fake. Today i saw her in one of my classes and she walks by and very scornfully says, Hi alicia...and im like uhh why did you have to say it like that?! and she was like all i did was say hi and rolled her eyes and walked away. I was actually deciding to start distancing myself away from here which i think i will because she has never given me an attitude before....should i try and still be her friend or just totally forget about her and let her carry on, on being really fake now?
