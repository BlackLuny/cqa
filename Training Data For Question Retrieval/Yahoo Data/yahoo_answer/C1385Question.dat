20090304091259AA75QwP	Social Science;Psychology	Life is too short...?	Tonight I realized that life is too short to be mad or sad or angry, to regret. I know it is a cliché, but the thing with clichés is that it's a common idea or feeling that everyone feels in their life. I was crying because my best friend is moving away and I have just recently lost a few friends because I decided that they weren't being "good enough friends". But then I realized that I should just let it all go and try to give them another chance, and if not, just take them as they are because you can never have too many friends. And that I should just try to accept everything, because things are inevitable, and be optimistic and keep moving on with my life. Have you ever had a moment where all of these clichés kind of add up and you have a whole new perspective on life? Please share:

20090304092043AAcZKRP	Social Science;Economics	Economics problem???????????	Just need a little help.      Consider an economy with only consumption and investment. Consumption is equal to $500 billion when national income is zero and increases by 75 cents when disposable income increases by $1. Investment is constant at $200 billion for all levels of national income.             In this economy, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is:            A.    0.75           B.    2,800           C.    1.00           D.    0.25           E.    0           F.    700           G.    500      In this economy, the aggregate expenditures multiplier is:                                A.    0.75           B.    10.00           C.    1.00           D.    0           E.    4.00           F.    0.25           G.    1.33           H.    0.50           I.    2.50        If the marginal propensity to save rises:                            A.    The value of the aggregate expenditures multiplier falls.        B.    The value of the aggregate expenditures multiplier rises.        C.    The value of the aggregate expenditures multiplier is unaffected.

20090304094709AAbEzpa	Social Science;Psychology	How can I begin loving myself.  (healthwise (physically) and emotionally)?	Growing up, I had always had a low self esteem.  At home, my sisters made fun of me, at school the kids made fun of me so I usually leaned towards my parents and older adults for friendships and understanding. Anytime I would try to do something that would make me feel good about myself, my sisters just took my self esteem and put it to the floor.  So would the kids at school. Now an adult, after healing from eating disorders in college (anorexia and bulima) I have another problem and thats overeating or emotional eating.  Ive gained weight since the birth of my son, I was healthy before and throughout he pregnancy but now cant get rid of the 50 pounds Ive gained. Im not anorexic or bulimic anymore, I stopped that long before my mid 20s but I still have low self esteem because of my past, how can I begin to love myself so that I can take control of my health both emotionally and physically. Any suggestions, experience or books would be helpful. THANKS! :)

I've had a history of being worried about a future break up, even when things are going well.  I have thoughts about how things will end and try to prepare myself.  This leads to bad things: not focusing on how great things are going, being insecure and feeling anxious, etc.      Is there a way I can just breathe and appreciate what I have?  If a relationship is going to end, it will end.  My stress is not going to change that...
20090304100020AAXRDOH	Social Science;Psychology	Is my girlfriend's anger a  phase?	My girlfriend and I have been together almost nine months. We were also friends before we got together. In the beginning she was so nice and sensitive. And she was in a previous relationship for three years and she was just so sweet to the girl even though the girl treated her like crap and cheated on her multiple times.      I, on the other hand have never cheated, have treated her perfect, and been there for her in yet she's always rude to me. Before we got together, her and the other girl had probably been broke up 7 months.       But she used to be so nice and sweet to me. Now she's just bitter and rude.      I told her that it's starting to drive me away and she said there's nothing she could do about it. That she can't help it. And I thought to myself, if the one that I'm in love with told me that I'm driving them away... then I would do everything in my power to try to change the situation.       And I told her I would leave her if this kept up and she hasn't even tried to change.      Will she always be this way... or is it just stress because she has been very stressed out lately. But I'm just so sick of her being rude to me... I don't think it's fair.
20090304100225AA5K1iJ	Social Science;Economics	Who would like to boycott banking and investments and live on a social program created by a society?	I don't have a question. I have the answer. Its called Give 10 Get 10. Its based on stories of isolated communities who consistently contributed money to one pot, and then when one family or individual was in need the money was given to them to help settle their debt,  and it would be an occurring cycle so that the money would always be there whenever someone needed it! Think about it: If 10 people gave just 10 dollars out of their pocket that's $100! Boom, just like that. Now think of it on a grander scale. 10,000 people giving just $10.. that's $100,000! Most people don't make that in 10 years!!! $100,000 could be split into 10 to help 10 families in need. THAT'S $10,000! I know I could use that kind of money to pay off my debt! And others could need it to keep their homes, put food on the table, clothes on their backs, ULTIMATELY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE! This is my idea. How would I go about setting this up and getting a wide span of people involved so that it could sustain itself?

I have my own ideas but I can't briefly post them here since I don't want to bore you plus I am not very pithy...at all!   Please! If you can help me with these questions I would GREATLY appreciate it. I do understand economics, But I have no one to discuss these issues with because very few of my friends or Girl has a clue in regard to the economy and how it works. I may have to post them one at a time, but if you can answer all I'd be eternally greatfull. You can kind of even mesh them all together or one at a time.            #1  What exactly, in your opinion caused the Great Depression?   #2  Do you think the 2 causes are similar in any way? (between reasons for economic problems then and now)   #3 Is it realistic to think we (America) can get back to the economic prosperity of say, 2 years ago in the next 10 years? Or was that bubble just unrealistic and unsustainable?   #4  IYO, will the stimulus bill help create *sustainable* economic GROWTH for this country, Or just create a bunch of short term government jobs to keep ppl. employed and create more spending programs? Basically Do think it will help? How and why?      Thank you SO much if you take the time to answer this. Truly. :)

20090304071350AAM1gcy	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think I need a psychologist?	I think I think too much. It makes me really quiet and I always have my head in the clouds, and I tend to think about one situation WAY too long. I've always been like this though. In home videos of me I'm the quietest kid out of all my 5 brothers and sisters. Over the noise of them you can hear nintendo music in the backround and you see me sitting silently with my legs indian crossed glued to the screen.      The first thing people say about me is that i'm tall (6'4), the second thing they notice about me is how quiet I am. It bugs them alot, especially the girls at my school. I can't help it though, I've always been like this. If you were to see what I was thinking at any given moment its probably me thinking that I think too much, devising a way to say something to someone else, or probably a random song. Do I need professional help or something? lol. Well I don't know if I do or not but it's making life kinda boring for me. It doesn't help when you have a voice so low and quiet a mouse could be heard over you. Or that my energy level is so low it feels like I stayed up all night.. every day. I've tryed coffee to help me get some energy and sometimes it works for maybe an hour but all my energy just makes me twitch, it never makes me more social. or vocal. Whats really strange is that if you saw me you would never think I would be the type of person to be like this.. But you can see that my eyes always have a look of boredome, or if I opened my mouth you could tell im the quiet type, or because I have a big head because I think so much. lol.       Well what really made me write all of this is because a girl at my work (I love being around her) tries to get me to open up and she's really the only person that makes me think I have a chance. Last week I worked with her though and she told me right to my face that I'm too quiet. I didnt really know what to say.. and she's always complaining in one way or another and I know that she wishes I talk to her more. Its not the first time someone's told me that i'm too quiet but I really care about her and it made me feel like crap. Well later the manager cut our hours so we got off work at the same time and she didn't have a ride. We both went into the lobby and talked a little bit and she said "your lucky at least you have a ride" with a smile. I told her I could give her a ride but she kind of ignored me and brought up something else. After hanging out a few minutes I was about to leave so I said "so are you just gonna chill here or do you want me to give you a ride"? she kinda frowned and after a pause and just said that she would stay at the restaurant. It made me feel like sh*t because I know she needed a ride but because i'm so quiet all the time she doesn't trust me.       Its not so much this single situation that makes me disappointed about how I am, its pretty much been like this my whole life. I've never done drugs, never partied, never been drunk, I've been told I'm a nice person and I don't go to church much but I am a christian. I'm contemplating alcohol to see if it can make me open up more. (I'm still 18) but a few beers before work might be able to let help me relax. Drugs already screwed up my brothers life, and led my best friend since i've known since I was 5 years old to attempt suicide by overdose. Another one of my best friends since 4rth grade started having sex with girls he barely knows. Its just disappointed me I guess, and I'm waiting for that special girl when I'm married to lose my virginity too. But if it'll help me be happier or open up more... i'm starting to lose sight of what I thought I wanted.. Kudos for anyone who read all of this and I would appreciate what to hear what you think about it.

20090304071210AAve0yu	Social Science;Economics	Is time to take a 'Good close look at Capitalism' as it is practiced in most parts of the world?	The definition of Capitalism:   'An economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market.'   A critical part of the definition of capitalism is the idea of laissez-faire, a French term which roughly translates into "allow to do" or "leave alone."   This is what many so called 'Conservatives' around the world believe especially here in America. The less regulated.. businesses are, the more than can operate and stimulate business. At least this is the argument. But does it really make sense? If all us really take a step back into history and understand that through Capitalism, the common man invested in companies so that said companies could produce goods and or services that said investor needed in his or her community or state. As time progressed investments were soon made in many companies with the sole purpose of making money on the return from their investment. Now with 'speculators' and millions literally 'playing' the stock market, the whole concept of what Capitalism was meant to do has changed dramatically.   Economist Thomas Sowell described it this way:   "When an investment is made, whether to build a railroad or to open a new restaurant, the first money is spent hiring the people to do the work. Without that, nothing happens. Even when one person decides to operate a store or hamburger stand without employees, that person must first pay somebody to deliver the goods that are going to be sold. Money goes out first to pay expenses and then comes back as profits later—if at all. The high rate of failure of new businesses makes painfully clear that there is nothing inevitable about the money coming back."   But who is investing in the small businesses of today?...no one! People don't invest in small businesses today for the sole purpose of said business to succeed. For the most part, people invest today to get rich.   Moreover, individuals and corporations have violated the principles of fair trade, by concealing and falsifying information, and while their own personal freedom and wealth may be enhanced, both society and the free market they have conned are suffering.   So I ask in all seriousness, do we all need to take a good close look at how we operate as Society, and if more and stiffer government regulations are not the answers....then what are?   I would really like to some unbiased thought on this issue.

But reality is - we men don't. I don't know any guy who laughs when he hears a woman has been assaulted - let alone sexually assaulted.      Yet women are always promoting sexual battery of men as an acceptable method for controlling men.         I'm not saying every woman - but certainly most women.       So does this make men 'better' than women, if we can see the harm in hurting women - but women can't see the harm in hurting men?      Should men go about promoting 'rape' or sexual assault of women as a method of controlling women?      Of course not.      So why do women find it acceptable?

20090227061532AAb0EOr	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think this is irrational?	I don't talk to my mother or brother. My mother, I don't live with. My brother, I do. So what happened with my mother is.. well.. it was a lot of things. One thing in particular is that she would ask me to kill myself with her when I was a kid till I was 13, her depression started when I was 6. And I dunno. In my eye's she's a bad person. I mean she tried to get my dad put in jail (it's complicated but dad didn't do anything wrong but she was making it out to the police that he was a real threat when he has NEVER EVER been abusive) and then threatened me about it. That was about 5yrs ago and it's been about 5years since I've talked to her. um and I mean I know it hasn't gotten any better because she told my sister to tell me that if I didn't talk to her she'd kill herself. And according to my sister she is an alcoholic. She's just not a good person to be around.   My brother.. well he sort of teased me about being raped. He said I could "f--- all the 'abbos' [I] want" repeatedly and I haven't talked to him since. That was in Nov last year.    I know it's not very assertive not talking to people but I just don't want to. I have nothing more to say to them. Both of them have done or said things that were so over the line I just.. yeah. And I'm 18 so I should be able to decide who I want to talk to right?   But I'm guessing it's a yes, my sister seems to think so. But I want to know you're opinion. I mean I THINK I have good enough reason to not want to talk to them.

He says one thing but means something totally different. When I try to discuss feelings he tells me that he doesn't have feelings for me and he gets all jittery but his actions show otherwise and he has told others that he does like me. When he does open up (very little) I have learned that his childhood was hard and his mom passed away when he was fifteen. Articles state that this can attribute to the aggressive behavior. I need him to open up and let me know how he really feels or I am walking away. Any suggestions on dealing with a passive agressive person? Has anyone ever dealt with one before? Thanks!

Making mistakes is part of the definition of being human.  It's just important to avoid making the same mistakes twice.  What are your thoughts?  Do you have any regrets?
20090227061507AAAeHyu	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why cant men carry purses?	Didnt men used to carry money purses in ancient times?  When did it become a "woman" thing to carry a purse.        To get in the building I work in, you have to go through a security checkpoint, you have to put your stuff on a conveyor belt, go through a metal detector and get your stuff on the other end.  With me, its no problem.  I pop my purse onto the conveyor belt and go.        But sometimes there is a man in front of me.  He has got stuff in every pocket on his body...some change in this pocket, his cell phone in that pocket, he wallet in this other pocket, his glasses in his jacket pocket...and I have to stand there the whole time while he is emptying his many pockets.  Then the metal detector still goes off cause he forgot he had his PDA in his other jacket pocket.  Wouldnt it just be so much easier to carry a purse???

Reason for asking I went to a close mate who’s life ended just before Christmas via sucide, via hanging.      I only knew the kid in question for about 3 years during my college days back in the early 00’s.      Its Aaron birthday well it would have been next week but me and a few pals were interested in doing something in honour of him.         We all played in the same football team together and we want to do something in memory!         According to his family reason he took his own life no one really knows for sure of course but the main route of the problem was his girl left him and also someone stole his bike, pressure got to him and also family rows.            Sad.
20090304082053AAED9c0	Social Science;Psychology	What's the matter with this guy? Why does he feel a need to make up stories about me?	I had told this guy in the lab off before Christmas. I didn't like the way he insulted "smart" girls. He said that "smart girls pretend to like a guy when they don't," "they mislead guys all the time", "they pretend to be naive when they're not," "they manipulate the situation for their own benefits until they get what they want", that "no guys like smart girls that's why they have to pretend to be stupid".       I finally had enough of his insults about girls (he was ALWAYS criticizing girls -- calling them fat or ugly, stupid, etc. So on behalf of myself and all the other girls in the world, I stood up to him and told him in no uncertain terms that he's a judgmental and superficial jerk who talks nonsense, and I no longer wished to speak with him anymore.      Then we had winter break and we didn't see each other for more than a month and a half. He was still working in the school lab this whole time because he's a grad student. (I didn't have classes so I went out with friends/family during vacation).       I return for spring semester to school. I saw him in the hallways and he looked like he was in love with me, but I ignored him.       Then I find out from another lab people that he's been gossiping about me! He said that I was "in love" with him and that I was "stalking" him. That completely floored me.       Why would someone make up something like that about me when I have absolutely no interest or attraction towards this guy?

20090304075952AA2jQsJ	Social Science;Psychology	My unhealthy fixation with big breasts?	I wanted to express my strong affinity for big titties.       So there's this girl at my school. Her breasts are HUGE and BOUNCY! I prefer older women but she's in the 1th grade. I'm in 12th. I do get along with her very well but she's not my gf or anything but we do say hi when we see each other. During those times, my eyesight go right to her gigantic breasts. It's not just her. I love hugh breasts although some people are going to tell me right off the bat that this is normal. But I want to tame my passion before it turns into an unhealthy fixation.       I don't know why but my body actually responds when I'm physically looking at somebody's breasts or down her shirt, but doesn't respond at all when it's all on the internet or on my phone. I did take a picture of her chest to btw. I did look down her shirt but I didn't see anything. My heart was POUNDING when i was. I didn't get caught taking pictures of her breasts, I didn't get caught looking down her shirt.       I wish I had breasts! I'm a transgender female, and I wish I had titties, big titties let alone my ideal female form. Not just for sexual gratification but because I am a female, or rather identify as one. Not planning on going through surgery btw.

I had a dream last nite that I was cleaning my room/apt (not really mine tho, it was my boyfriend's but in the dream it was mine) when all of the sudden we started seeing cockroaches; I almost puked b/c I was so disgusted.  At first it was a couple when out of nowhere a whole lot started coming in thru the door, like hundreds (there were worms too) we tried to stomp them but of course we only got a few.  I was trying to understand where they were coming from, when we realised there was a flood, the bugs were trying to escape it.  The water was pretty clear but very strong, we were on the 2nd floor and it covered the stairs pretty quickly.  In the dream I think I may have been swept away when i tried to go down the stairs to get out.  I was not scared at all, the only emotion I felt during the dream was being disgusted by the bugs.  Sorry I know it's kind of lengthy, but does anybody know what the dream could mean?

Except he didn't die, dying is natural, he was murdered, stolen from us,  nearly 5 years ago by two strangers  who stamped and beat him to death with out any motive, just because he was there.    He was such a lovely man. Because it was his car it feels as though i am destroying another bit of him. Getting rid of more signs that he was ever here. I feel so so sad about it. I thought i had coped so well, but this is just making me feel so sad, and opening old wounds. I don't really want to keep the car, but i don't want to destroy it. It's silly, it's just metal and i have never particualarly loved the car either, but now it is time to get rid of it i'm finding it so hard. How can i feel better about this?

20090304093256AAKFuOK	Social Science;Economics	Can somebody please explain how taxing the rich is a good idea?	Obama is trying to raise the taxes on the rich.      Now, mind you (these are facts that were derived from IRS reports      the top 1% of tax paying Americans earned 1.79 Trillion Dollars (22.06% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 1%) 408.4 Billion Dollars      The Bottom 95% of tax paying Americans earned 5.14 Trillion Dollars (63.34% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 95%) 408.1 Billion Dollars      That means. 95% of Americans (the poor that Obama is not going to tax) supplied less than the 1% of Americans Obama is going to try and tax.       I have some questions      How can a group that earns 2.87 times less money than the other group, yet still pay more in taxes?      Seems to me, like the 95% need to have their taxes increased by 287% so that it is even across the board, right?      Also, mind you. That 95%, if their taxes increase and worst comes to it, they leave the country. Lets do some math      95% of the US Population = 288633408 people   1% of the US Population =      3038246.4 people      Now, if obama taxes the 1% and they leave, and avoid paying taxes the government loses ~408 billion dollars      Based on the # of americans in the 95% range, and the amount paid by that entire group you get $1413.9 per person      If obama increased the taxes on them instead, and the same # of americans left the country (1% of total = 3038246.4 people) the government loses 4.3 billion dollars      4.3 billion dollars >> 408.4 billion dollars      and mind you the 1% already pays 2.87 times more in taxes than the 95% as a whole.       I know the what 95% of the population voting for a man is going to overwhelm the 1% voting for the other, so obviously the 95% wont care, because they aren't getting the short end of the stick      but what if them voting for obama, causes the percentage of Americans that actually mean something to the country leaves, or lays of workers to cover the taxes..         Somebody make this make sense to me please.   Is it really just the poor overwhelming the rich in votes, so now the rich have to pay even more? Since when did it become ok to pick on the minority? Give the minority scholarships yet take away from another minority so long as its accepted by the majority?   What if the minority says screw it, and leaves for a prospering country? We all know they have hte money and power to do it?      Will America remain free, if it watched the only group of Americans that could actually affect the country leave? Or will the military force them to stay, just like Germany did to Fritz Haber. Who mind you, became a war criminal because he was forced by Germany to make poisonous gas.       How can increasing the taxes on the group that already pays more in taxes fair?       I say increase the taxes on the other 95% by 287% and then go from there. Enough with the "I am poor its not fair i didn't go to Harvard and I'm not smart"

20090304104359AAihN3B	Social Science;Psychology	I am beyond miserable. I need to just get away?	I don't even know what to do with myself anymore.      I have never been this depressed in my entire life. I don't even have an appetite anymore. This can go on for weeks. Which isn't the best of situations, because I'm pregnant.      I'm TIRED of being bombarded with everyone. My friends and family can tell me their problems, but when I try to tell them mine, they don't care. They don't listen. They're just hearing, but not actually listening. The replies are, "oh, that sucks." or "yeah, I've been there before, but life gets better."      That doesn't even sound remotely sincere.       I need antidepressants and I have Social Anxiety Disorder, but I never get medication for anything, because no one in my house listens to me! No one ever takes me seriously.       Then when I say I want to just die, they actually have the indecency to ask "why?" They don't even know me. God. They would only care, because they felt obligated to, not because they really cared.       I want to disconnect my phone so my ex can't get ahold of me anymore. I don't even want to interact with friends. They've become other people to me. They're so wrapped up in their own problems, that they're not interested in socializing anymore, and I need someone. But of course, I have no one. I always end up without anyone. And when I finally feel that I have found someone that will just listen to me, I end up losing them anyway.      I just want to disappear for awhile, but that's not even possible. I can't move out and expect to financially support myself. I'm doomed to being in my house, alone and miserable until I die.      What is a person supposed to do in this state?

I called 911 but they didn't believe me. So I took them home with me. The mother elephant told me that her back hurt and then the baby elephant came out. I left them to rest.   When I came back, the mother elephant was gone and there was P. Diddy watching over the sleeping baby elephant. I asked where her mother was and he said she was dead. I ran to get help and when I came back P. Diddy was gone. I named the baby Muffin and I was trying to find a safe place to hide her. She could talk and I knew someone was trying to steal her. Then I woke up.

20090304101242AAQO1nQ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had an interesting dream. Can anyone interpret it? Thanks!?	My dream began with this guy I started talking to. We have been talking for about 4 months now, no kissing or sex whatsover until Im ready.  Anyhow, it was in my new apartment and we were hanging out when in the dream, we went to the kitchen and started to makeout (I know, I sorry Im trying not to make it sound like a porn or something) and ended up sleeping together. From the dream, it was pretty passionate and nice.  So then next thing you know, we are running away from people, they are after us, we are on the street hiding and when he grabs my hand, I look at him and realize its my ex, my first real love, the guy Ive always loved and still love deep down.  I felt so happy and safe and secure.  He made sure I was ok and he protected me and cared for me from these people chasing us. I had a sense of security and love being with him.  We ran off away from these people, until we were safe, but it was him I was truly happy with in the dream.  We also had our moment of lovemaking in the dream as well.  What does this mean? And dont be stupid answering the question. This is serious! :P
20090304110715AADTPrU	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why am I having this dream about my ex..?	My ex and I have been broken up for over 6 years. We dated off and on for 5. We were engaged. He was a very disturbed guy. He brain washed me. But I do think that I was really in love with him.....I keep having dreams about him ever since we've been broken up. About once a week or maybe sometimes only every 2 weeks I have dreams about us. I dream (every single time just different senarios) that him and i are going to get back together. That he is still married to his wife but he is leaving her for me. We start talking and even kiss but thats all.....thats my dream every single time.  I don't have a clue why I have dreams about him. I am engaged and in love with my fiancee. When my ex and i did break up we continued to talk and see eachother for almost 2 years after our break up. Even though we he was with his now wife him and i still talked. We finally stopped talking about a year ago. But I know he's not the one for me. He is sick in the head. (He wants and lives for 3somes thats why I am NOT with him) my whole family says he had me brainwashed cause I dressed how he liked, only talked to friends he wanted me to talk to, things like that. So PLEASE someone tell me your honest opinion WHY I have dreams about him and i getting back together after this many years and why I dream it all the time after this many years..thank you!

20090304095944AArGyeM	Social Science;Psychology	I had a dream once about a tower, a clown, and a robber, what do they mean?	Okay I posted this in the dream section a few days ago but only got one answer and I want more than one answer, so I decided to post it here.       I can only remember these dreams for some reason. Actually one of them I had last night. Okay one the dreams i had was a few years ago. In the dream it looked like I was in a tower and i was being chased by some man. The tower was on a large piece of land and it looked like one you would see with a medieval castle, except the tower was by its self. Also in the dream the tower on the inside there were stairs and they were the spiral kind. What do you think that dream meant/means?       Another one I had which was years ago was I was in a big city ( maybe boston) and I was on the subway(train) and I was wearing a white nightgown and being chased by a clown with a knife. It was nighttime in the dream and also I don't have a fear of clowns I like them, well sorta their funny once and a while. so what could that dream meant/mean.      Now this is the one I had last night. In the dream I was in my house, alone. And some one broke in (I cant remember if it was a man or woman) anyways in the dream I ended up stabbing the person with a knife numerous times. Okay this is the weird part after the person was lying on the floor dead there wasnt any blood and it was like the person was like sponge cake. After that in the dream I called 911 and said I stabbed someone, only the emergency workers( police, emts) didnt show up and in the dream I was saying to myself something like "whats taking them so long?" Than I woke up. Now what could that one have meant/mean?      Thanks.  :)

Ok for the past few weeks I've been having dreams where I am being chased by a dog...one time it was a bear...I wake up before I am attacked...in the last dog dream the dog actually bit me and I woke up...then two nights ago I had a dream I was in an elevator and I kept pushing the number 3...but the elevator would go up to floor 9...then back down to 1...and not stop nor would the doors open...and this went on for quite sometime and I woke up hysterical.    What could these mean?  Am I looking into them too much or are dreams just random?

20090304102527AANGCsY	Social Science;Psychology	Really mean remarks from a female colleague or am I imagining it?  Why is she doing it?	We were having a discussion about parks and bringing children into them..and this female colleague told me that she saw some weird stuff going on recently so she doesn't bring her children there anymore. I asked 'what kind of weird stuff' and she replied very dismissively 'oh, you wouldn't understand, you don't have children'. I replied, 'oh I would, I have nieces and nephews and I was a child myself once'. Another time, she said to me 'oh, many of my friends got pregnant on purpose when they reached 40 & hadn't met a guy'. I answered 'that never happened to me'. The fact is I've never married or had children, am a few years older than her and live a lovely life, contracting & travelling in between. I feel she is giving me mean digs. Why is she doing this to me? It seems so rude.

20090304122346AAWQnVC	Social Science;Psychology	On the MBTI test results, what does it mean if you are in the center of thinking/feeling?	I just took the MBTI for a class. It labeled me an ENFJ, which I agree with to a certain extent. In the area of thinking/feeling, I was literally 1 point further to the "feeling" side. Upon reading about ENFJ's and ENTJ's, I find myself having characteristics of both. Just wondering if this means I'd be well suited for jobs under the ENFJ category or the ENTJ category. I am in school for accounting, which is where my biggest interest lies, but want to make sure I'm doing the right thing!
