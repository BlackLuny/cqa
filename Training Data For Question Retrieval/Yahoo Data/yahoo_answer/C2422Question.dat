I used to love reading to the point where I could read all day and would stay up way past my bedtime reading.  Now I cant seem to even finish books or even focus as well because it does not seem as fun as it used to.  Is this because the novelty of the action of reading has expired.  Has this happened to anyone else before...where you start off reading books cover to cover then you get sick of reading?

Here's the paragraph:      She had turned to him, smiling, and her face seemed luminous in the light that filtered through the dusty uncurtained window. They gazed at each other, absorbing each minute flicker in the other’s love-lit eyes, until at last he drew her to him and she clung to him, and felt the shudder as a sob broke from deep within him as she started to cry.

20090219150418AAu9qJx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read and comment on my story plz and give me ideas for a name and continueing it?	here it is it doesn't have a name yet :      I was in the tomb. Don't ask me why or how, I just was. I grabbed a torch off the wall to light my path, and began to walk forward to get an idea where i was. the tombs walls were stone, cold and bare. then i looked down. in front of me was a large rectangular case that i figured must hold the coffin. the only weird thing was it had no cracks around the edges so i must have been built around the coffin. suddenly the door closed behind me except, when i turn around there ,was no door only grey stone. i looked down again. on the coffin there was now a white lily.as i watched it curiously, it slowly transformed so it was no longer a lily, but a young woman. she was beautiful. dressed in a sleeveless delicate flowing white dress.her mahogany hair spread out across the cold stone table. her pale skin was flawless. i wondered why she had chosen such a cold cruel bed to sleep upon. as soon as i thought it, her hand slid off her chest palm up.then i knew why. across her palm a the skin was torn and a red stripe interupted the pale peach. the wound was very fresh, still bleeding even.suddenly blood began to ooze from her stomach staining her dress where ever it touched then the blood became flame which slowly filled the room till you could see nothing else. then the girl began to rise from her crude bed until she was in a standing position.her eyes were still closed. she began to reach out towards me with her arm. once fully extended, her eyes snapped open. they were an icy blue.at the same time ice shot out from her hand and engulfed me. when i regained consciousness, i was back in the tomb. there were no signs of a fire. the girl was gone as well. then i looked down and there placed across the lily was a rose.a single thorn on the stem held a drop of blood. then i looked at the rose. it was stained, blood red.

20090219140137AA3GyeJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What books can i read that are similar to snitch by Allison van Diepen?	It's about a girl name Julia and her friends try to stay clear of the gangs that run rampant in her Brooklyn high school. Up until the day that Eric Valiente shows up, she has succeeded. A chance encounter in the dean's office on Eric's first day brings the two of them together.       Julia is instantly attracted to the hot new student, but she's never been the type of girl to score a guy like him. At a school dance, however, Eric makes the first move on Julia, and they quickly become an item.       But Eric has secrets of his own that he's not willing to share. Before long, he has become a member of the Crips gang. This goes against everything Julia believes, and soon, she breaks up with him. But one night at a club, she hears that a rival gang is going to jump Eric. With a subtle warning to Eric, life changes for Julia.       Overnight, she is considered a snitch and loses all of her friends. For her own protection, and against Eric's pleadings, she asks to join the Crips, as well.       Once a Crip always a Crip. At least until the night that the leader of the gang and some of his lieutenants are busted in a raid. All eyes turn to Julia and Eric as the snitches. Can it be happening to her again?       Ms. Van Diepen writes a powerful novel of the struggles to avoid the attraction of inner city gangs. Julia is a strong, independent character who tries valiantly to avoid the politics that goes on in her community. Only when it comes to her own protection does she have to reevaluate where she stands. The story moves quickly and is quite gripping and gritty in its details

20090219143805AAeykgL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone remember this book?	I took it out of a library around 1999.  It's a young adult novel and the protagonist is a teenage female who is writing a book.  Every time she pulls her book out, she writes one line.  She's the oldest of at least four children, some of them very young.  Also, she would jog alone near a beach (to a lake, I think) in the morning.        The action with the biggest affect on the plot line was that two or three males showed up that were actually characters from the books she'd pulled out on her bookshelf.  Two of the boys were exact mirror images of each other, so one's heart was more toward the left of his chest and the other was on the right.  I think one of the boys was called "Odin."  The boy who was a mirror image, with the heart toward the right, was rather hostile and unsympathetic.        The cover had three male bodies outlined and a female's head and shoulders in front of them.        I can't remember the title, author, or anything useful.  Hopefully someone else has read this book and can clue me in.

20090220081907AA1T9rk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Tiny Prologue Syndrome?  Or: Has Meyer shortened our collective intros?	I've noticed more and more recently, that writing samples on this and other sites feel the need to include a prologue--and a tiny one, about 4 paragraphs long at that. Why is that?      Many, if not most, books in the past didn't have a prologue at all, and when they did, many of them would make it more akin to a full or half-chapter in length. Or at least several pages. But now it seems more and more writers are feeling the need to have one and to make them short and poppy.      I credit/blame Stephenie Meyer and Twilight, which uses such stylistic and short prologues.       For me, personally, I don't mind it really, except that I think too many people are starting to sound the same, just copying one style they've read recently. It's not original any more, so it doesn't grab me like it should. And I think many feel forced and don't serve the story. But it seems people think they need to have one so they do, if the story needs it or not.      I know many young people are inspired and I like that, I do. I encourage it. And I think this is great practice for a while new generation of writers. Mimicry is but a first step to originality. But at the same time, the widespread parroting of style worries me a bit. Is this how the creative process always went and we are just now being able to see into people's lives more and sooner thanks to the web, or are kids today better trained/able to just copy what they see rather than to originate new styles and ideas on their own? I'm not sure, myself.      What do you think?

20090220083308AAvtqjF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poem or Quote????????	"Why did she do it?    Nobody dared to ask.    Because - what courage!    Who had the courage to burn herself?    Twenty aspirin,    a little slit alongside the veins of the arm,    maybe even a bad half hour standing on a roof:    We've all had those.    And somewhat more dangerous things,    like putting a gun in your mouth.    But you put it there,    you taste it,    it's cold and greasy,    your finger is on the trigger,    and you find that a whole world lies between this moment    and the moment you've been planning,    when you'll pull the trigger.    That world defeats you.    You put the gun back in the drawer.    You'll have to find another way.    What was that moment like for her?    The moment she lit the match.    Had she already tried roofs and guns and aspirins?    Or was it just an inspiration?    I had an inspiration once.    I woke up one morning    and I knew that today I had to swallow fifty aspirin   It was my task:    my job for the day.    I lined them up on my desk and took them one by one, counting.    But it's not the same as what she did.    I could have stopped,    at ten,    or at thirty.    And I could have done what I did do,    which was go onto the street and faint.    Fifty aspirin is a lot of aspirin,    but going onto the street and fainting    is like putting the gun back in the drawer.    She lit the match."                                    — Susanna Kaysen     i read this as a poem but im pretty sure its a quote.

20090219165916AASLoyz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What are some good romance, action, or drama focused books for middle schoolers and where can I get them?	I love romances that are sweet and tender, but don't go "all the way", if you catch my drift. I'm a middle schooler, so books appropriate from 6-maybe 9th grade. I am a Twilight fan, and I read books by Meg Cabot and Lauren Myracle, such as Avalon High, The American Teen, Ttyl..etc. Plz help me get some good ideas! I also like drama and action books. I read quite a mixed set. I love reading, so long series are good for me. Big books are no problem. I'm only in 5th grade(dont say im too young, there are 9 year olds here o.O), but I can finish Eclipse or Twilight in a day. For drama, i like the gossip girl series, and for action, i like the maximum ride series. I like reading teen books better then "on grade lvl" books that are super cheezy or something. Thnx for the help!

She lives in the era where people raise wild wolves as pets and have different jobs in their "tribes". She wants to go and venture out like many of the brave people in the past and live in the wild forest, raising a whole clan of wild wolves.

Just as she thought her life would get better, everything goes downhill and her plans go horribly wrong.      Should I write a book on this? I need opinions! Thanks!

Living life is functioning in it, not pondering it. I feel like I'm living the hero/ego complex of a deep thinker, or maybe I'm getting clumsy in life?

20090220102011AAGErnl	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Looking for opinions on my sort of poem?	I would really consider this more slam poetry, if you all know what that means. It's definitely meant more to be spoken then just read. But I figured I would see what you all thought anyway.         Blurry, undefined faces and I can't seem to focus. Passing through the streets at night not really knowing where they lead. And I'm calling out for help with a voice that just won't work. Garggled words and raspy screams catch in my throat so that I can do nothing but choke them back. Certain that I must be floating cause I can't feel the ground beneath my feet. Trying to find a way to heal the scars that are far too deep to see. Always coming up empty cause some wounds just can't be fixed alone. Roaming around, grasping on to anyone I can reach. Seeking desperately for the meaning of true love. Finding only hopeless embraces and misplaced devotion. Void of any real emotion. Hands outstretched, groping blindly in the haze, praying for just one fingertip to graze softly against you. Cause I know now that someone like you is what I need. Spent my entire life searching for someone who could push the black away. Who could ease the aching in my chest and make these eyes, that once seemed eternally blind, finally see. Who could lift this weight, that gets heavier everyday, so my tired back could once again stand straight. You could bring the elusive sleep that never comes and finally ease this restless mind. You could return the smile to these lips, and if they don't remember how, then someone like you could teach them what real joy means. No longer will I simply go through the motions. Cause it's someone like you who could guide my way to purpose, to meaning. And I'll do anything to make you notice. Cause someone like you was created for someone like me.

20090220090643AAjeZjd	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can anybody tell me what this book is?	I read it when I was about eleven. It was a book of scary stories meant for tweens, I think. No, it wasn't Scary Stories to Read in the Dark. I can't remember how many stories it had, but I do remember what some were about. One was about a little boy who saw a movie about killer ants against his mother's will, and then started feeling the sensation of ants crawling all over him. Another was about a little girl whose house burnt down, and she goes to live with her grandparents after her parents are killed in the fire. Then there was one about a girl whose dead aunt comes back from the grave to get revenge (that one was my favorite). Can anybody remember the title of the book, or even the author? I'm dying to read it again- I loved it so much when I was younger.

Poem:      The Road Not Taken      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;      Then took the other, as just as fair,    And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same.      And both that morning equally lay   In leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back..      I shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I—   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.            --Robert Frost, 1916

A MESSAGE    Elizabeth Stuart Ward (1844-1911)       Was there ever message sweeter         Than that one from Malvern Hill,   From a grim old fellow,-you remember?        Dying in the dark at Malvern Hill.    With his rough face turned a little,            On, a heap of scarlet sand,   They found him, just within the thicket,        With a picture in his hand,    With a stained and crumpled picture         Of a woman's aged face;   Yet there seemed to leap a wild entreaty,        Young and living-tender-from the face   When they flashed the lantern on it,        Gilding all the purple shade,   And stooped to raise him softly,       That's my mother, sir," he said.    "Tell her"-but he wandered, slipping        Into tangled words and cries,   Something about Mac and Hooker,        Something dropping through the cries   About the kitten by the fire,        And mother's cranberry-pies; and there    The words fell, and an utter        Silence brooded in the air.    just as he was drifting from them,        Out into the dark, alone   (Poor old mother, waiting for your message,        Waiting with the kitten, all alone!),   Through the hush his voice broke, Tell her        Thank you, Doctor-when you can,   Tell her that I kissed her picture,        And wished I'd been a better man."

I was attempting to switch from 9s to 11s on my Fender Strat, but the local music store owner told me that if I don't lock down the tremolo system it could cause a problem. He said go no higher then 10s.       My question is...      is it an easy DIY task to lock the tremolo system? Is it true that 11 gauge would be too heavy, even if I tune down a half step?      Should I just follow his advice and go with the 10s?      Thanks for answering!

20090203072101AACLnQt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please summarize in one or two sentences about each paragraph. ?	There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till...Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being....    Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested, — "But these impulses may be from below, not from above." I replied, "They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil." No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it...    What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude...    For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlour. If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs...    The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them...    A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.

In the beginning of every Twilight book, Stephenie Meyer includes a passage in which Bella describes a dream. The dream always foreshadows a later turning point and is almost completely accurate.     Does the fact that her dreams/nightmares come true signify the ability to predict the future, like Alice?     I'm surprised Stephenie Meyer never addresses this.

20090203085812AAI09vr	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does God or your spirit or whatever you call it answer your questions?	When you can not find an answer do you trust that you do have the answer within. We all love to get answers from others or books or movies, etc. but if you were doing something & you had no manual, if you didn't want to bug people, could you trust yourself to find the answer.      I am thinking about going back to work & I know I am going to have to learn this computer program & then all the legal parts of the job. There is no manual & I will have to depend on others. I used to work with these people & I really don't want to bother them cause they are already overwhelmed. I know that I can trust myself to come up with answers. I have never depended on my higher self this way before.      What is your experience with this? Are there any ideas or quotes or affirmations or anything you use that would help me to be more confindent. If you can tell me how this works it might inspire me to know that it will work for me. thanks.

20090203082356AARdZSv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	First chapter of my story. What do you think?	I glared at the mechanics back, cursing him silently. My truck wasn’t ready, but of course it wasn’t his fault. I eyed his beer belly and JETS tattoo suspiciously, reevaluating his excuses:       “ You told me it would be ready Monday. Its Friday.”  I had said, not trying to make my voice pleasant. This had happened before. He could tell I remembered.        “I’m so sorry” he said reluctantly turning away from the from the highlight reel on ESPN. “Truly, but I--I got swamped with calls for appointments and--and” he cast his small watery eyes about, looking for inspiration “and they sent me the wrong part! and I wasn’t prepared because Sunday’s not my usual business day. And the part just arrived today! I was doing you favor you know. “ he said with barely contained relief at finding a plausible excuse, “It will be ready on Tuesday” he said nodding in agreement with himself. He turned his back to me, escaping my mutinous scowl, using the excuse of writing a new receipt and putting the proper deductions in place. A man in a business suit came by then to drop some papers off , laying them neatly on the counter, promising to be right back. The mechanic smiled widely, silently thanking him for the extra time with t . v while he pretended to put the papers in order.  The man gave him a strange look, and a slightly protective glance at the papers, before disappearing out the door.        That was why I came here, he was such a poor liar that I’d know if he was doing something fishy. He wasn’t a bad mechanic, and watching football wasn’t a capital crime by any means, but he had told me Monday, and it was Friday.        He turned back to me, a guilty expression on his broad features, and laid my receipt on the counter. I grumbled something at his abstracted apology, and turned back towards the exit, holding the door open for the man returning for his papers and walked to the edge of the sidewalk, hailing a cab as I did so.          I was about climb in when the man in the business suit came bursting out of the shop, pointing at me and screaming at the top of his lungs for the cab to stop. I turned to shout back that the cab was taken, frightened by his furious and slightly demonic howling, only to find him pelting towards me, tie flying, briefcase lying forgotten behind him.           I jumped in the cab, slamming the door behind me, telling the cabby to go.  The tires squealed as the cab took off.           I shrieked as my door flew open and the demented man threw himself into the car, landing on top me as I tried to scoot to the other side.            He ignored my relentless hitting and kicking, hands scrabbling at my pockets. He found the receipt that the mechanic had just given me and was attempting to remove it from my grasp when my foot finally found a purchase just below his kidney. The man rolled down the street, shouting profanities the whole while, before crawling to his knees and staggering towards his abandoned briefcase, occasionally glancing back at the fast disappearing cab.          “ You alright, lady? Do you need a hospital?” the cabby asked me, concern on his face as he sped down a narrow lane towards my home. I shook my head,  still stunned by the extraordinary actions of the man in the business suit, and stuffed my papers into my inner jacket pocket.          The cabby pulled up to my front door and bade me a good afternoon as I paid him for the escape vehicle, again asking if I needed assistance in anything. I thanked him again, declining his offer, then sought refuge on the living room couch, ignoring the look that my brother, Jack ,whom I shared a house with, gave me. I was in no mood to explain to him, but luckily, he was to busy fiddling with the new sign for his business to give me much thought.                      The rest of the week passed without incident, much to my hearts relief.                   I took a deep breath as I planned my schedule for Tuesday.        It was Sunday, and I hadn’t gone near the mechanics since last Thursday, when the possessed man attacked me.         I shook my head. I was just being silly. They’d probably found him by now and put him in a straight jacket and were doing mental stability tests. They would find something abnormal- I smiled at the understatement-and would have to send him to a facility far away. Besides, Jack, being the protective older brother, would find him and kick his behind if I ever chose to tell him about Mr. psycho.        I looked at my calendar, decided, and wrote under Tuesday:                                                   Get truck from Mechanic. Don’t be a chicken!          I sighed and replaced the calendar on the shelf, and suddenly wanting to take a hike. I grabbed my sneakers and a water bottle, scribbled a note to my brother should he get back before I did, and strolled out in the spring sunlight.          I returned, exhausted, to eat a sandwich, and sit down to a movie.       I eventually fell asleep watching the fourth installm
20090203090607AAR7riT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is it all a misunderstanding?	When you hear of people getting shot or the brutality of life, you think why?  People who have fear and anger going around terrorizing because they're confused, they see it as power.  Maybe people act out these psychotic dramas because they want to be loved.  In a way, can this behavior be seen as logical?  And then we say this is wrong but you could tell some people react to this power hunger as positive.  It gets me down but it shouldn't- it's all a misunderstanding?  What do you think?

20090220112024AAR4BB7	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Photographing babies?	My best friends Auntie recently asked me to take photographs of her 2 month old baby. She said she'd pay me, but does not have enough money to get them professionally done. I own a Nikon D40 and a good tripod, however I'm not very confident in my portraiture photography as I am still life, landscape etc.       I was just wondering if anyone could offer me any pointers on the following;       - Lighting.   - Background.   - Positioning.   - Angles.       And anything else you'd deem important. I'd really like to take up the opportunity, however I'm worried I wont produce photo's of the calibre she is expecting, especially if she has offered to pay me.       Thanks! x

Thanks!?	a yellow orchid is beautiful,   yet unique with spontaneous flare   freshly picked from my garden of love   with pedals as white as snow,    as light as a dove,    in awe one must surely stare   grown with water drained    from the fountains of adoration,   my distilled feelings of modesty    could not resist love's temptation,   as Sunlight tumbles down from Heaven's valleys and hills   blossoming with the quiet reserve of fruit renewed   raindrops the size of bullets collapse in puddles quietly stills   my hands plowed soil from Heaven's earthy veil   its passion for love as well known as Jonah and the Ark   or Ishmael and the Big White Whale   Sitting near a little rosary garden    as candlelight licks our faces   making love under the stars as fireworks erupt   and tis off to the races   angels carry diamond platters with champagn on ice   garbed in robes of silver, smelling like apple spice   conceived from the icy mountain tops of wintery romance   to rekindle the fire of our love lest it be my very last chance   notice how the pedals glisten in the moonlight,   ocean waves were engraved into their skins    its beauty intoxicating such a wonderful sight   let not the beauty of tis flower come as a surprise   for tis I see in your heart, tis in your eyes it lies   the stem was magically enchanted by God's angels   so that when thy pedals unfold secrets spill pools of songs   a mockingbird shall recite its melody held within love's tongs   I give this to you expecting nothing in return   tis your love for me and life itself I oh so yearn!      What do you think? I am seventeen years old and am trying to break out of my comfort zone with poetry. Normally my poetry is very prose, free verse and does not really have any meter, but I made an honest effort int his one so I hope you guys like it...especially the ladies..lol anyway enjoy!!!

20090220113501AAEaKzw	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What's a good analysis of this poem by robert browning?	Robert Browning   Home Thoughts, from Abroad   O, TO be in England   Now that April 's there,   And whoever wakes in England   Sees, some morning, unaware,   That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf   Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,   While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough   In England—now!   And after April, when May follows,   And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!   Hark, where my blossom'd pear-tree in the hedge   Leans to the field and scatters on the clover   Blossoms and dewdrops—at the bent spray's edge—   That 's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,   Lest you should think he never could recapture   The first fine careless rapture!   And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,   All will be gay when noontide wakes anew   The buttercups, the little children's dower   —Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!      i just don't know what he is saying...

I ended up attending Hogwarts, but I wanted to attend Durmstrang, since they openly teach the Dark Arts. Alas, my mother put her foot down. "There will be no Dark Wizards or Witches in MY house!"       I'm betting the Dark Lord got a lot of his Death Eaters from there. I would have definitely been a Death Eater, had the Dark Lord not fallen.      *pulls out wand and points it to the night sky anyways*      "Um, what's the incantation Draco taught me? Oh yeah...MORDISMORE!"      My wand is yew, 13 inches, dragon heartstring, by the way. Just in case you were wondering. I almost got ebony, 9 1/2 inches, dragon heartstring, but at the last moment this one picked me instead.       I am a Slytherin alumni. I attended Hogwarts from 1999-2006, and I played Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team. I own a Nimbus 2001, and I was hard-pressed to get that until I explained that Quidditch players need decent brooms. I wanted a Firebolt, but was told, "We can't afford it!"      I have 2 sisters and 1 brother.       Kally: 3rd year Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw Beater.   Alex: 2nd year Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw Seeker   Amy: 1st year Slytherin, wants to be Slytherin Seeker next year.   Mom: Slytherin alumni, was a Slytherin Chaser.   Dad: Hufflepuff alumni, was a Hufflepuff Beater.      Am I obsessed with Harry Potter? Why yes. Yes, I most certainly am. And yes, I'm a nut...but just go with it. It's easier that way. For everyone. :D

20090220060020AArJDy6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you have any tips for writing an novel?	Hi, I love to write all types of books. But the problem is is that I can't get any ideas. I heard from other arther's that the ideas just pop-ed  in their heads one day. So i took a break of trying to find "the perfect plot" and I just relaxed. But I 've been waiting for a couple of months and i am dying to use my pen. Can anyone tell me how to get an idea faster? And give me your idea of a good book.      Thanks and please reply!
