They can transfer to other states, but they will need to learn how to adapt other peoples' culture.

My elderly in-laws have received a letter from an out of town bailiff to say that they are collecting their rates arrears for the property.  They have not and never have been in debt in the whole of their lives.  The letter was addressed to their house but with some unknown name on it.  My mother-in-law rang the bailiff and told them this and they just laughted and thought it was funny.  She contacted the local council and they were sympathetic and said not to worry.  My in-laws are really worried about this (as elderly people do worry about things like this) and now won't leave the house in case the bailiff turns up and empties their house.  What's the law?  Anyone know?  Thanks!

20090223025003AAheXEv	Politics & Government;Politics	Are employees actually slaves of the Government?	When you work for a company that company has to pay a tax to the Government based on what that company pays you in addition to the taxes that you pay out of your pay.  So in essence the Government is charging that company a fee to have you work there so doesn't that make you the Government's slave if they can set a price for your service?  It would be like your employer charging another company to have you do work for them, but then not paying you for that time.

If we only use 10% of our brains then 90% of the brain mass of the earth is overusing its energy. This is a total waste of resources. i think we could each agree to pay like $100 each to have a surgery removal of it all. This would help stimulate the economy by creating jobs for surgeons and support personnel and we wouldn't have to eat as much food. Plus the massive amounts of excess brain material could be cured and pressed into mattress pads. This would make even more money for the environment.

20090223033708AAJzkpj	Politics & Government;Elections	Do you believe Dems. target the poor because they are the most uneducated and most uninformed voters in the US?	The view seldom changes from the bottom and that is why Dems. love to target and fool these people. I grew up very poor and I always voted Democrat. We had too much to deal with just surviving than to spend a ton of time on politics. So, the Dems told us that if we voted for them they would take care of us... and they did we remained in poverty throughout most of my childhood. When Bush took office things started changing my mom got a promotion at her job because she was the most qualified. We all have good jobs now and are doing well, not rich but we are not in poverty and we do not need assistance any more. But, I will tell you why I never voted Republican before it is because:   I NEVER LISTENED TO THEM   I NEVER LISTENED TO THEM   How can you expect to be informed if you only listen to one side of the argument? Poverty and miss information is what the Dems pray on and that has to stop.

Please read all of the details before answering the question.      They problem is, we have spent too much money, borrowed too much money for a couple decades or so, we have done nothing but go further into debt and, on top of that, we have gotten rid of our manufacturing base meaning we have no real way to pay anyone back through products, only through an massively inflated currency.      And, then top economists as well as the government say, the economy has grown.      No, our debt has grown, our economy has shrunk drastically to the point where manufacturing has become an insignificant part of GDP, only a few percent if that.

20090223044431AA6KWR8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are Obama & Pelosi forcing governors to raise taxes to pay for mandates in the stimulus?	Obama and Pelosi force changes on any state that accepts stimulus money.  BUT, Obama only gives the states money to pay for 2 1/2 years of the mandate.  The states' citizens must pay for the changes until eternity.
20090223035813AAiUqaE	Politics & Government;Elections	Do people believe spending money on ACORN and harvest mouse will create real jobs? Wasting money creates waste?	Wasting money only creates waste. The Obama spending plan is paying off his friends and it is unfair. Do you really believe that that former CEO who is now stocking groceries at Kroger is going to stay for long? Do you really believe that MIT student is going to make a career at your Bakery? No. these people are working to survive until they can get better jobs, not to make a career with these companies. But, what happens when Obama spending plan does not stimulate the economy and the well paying jobs do not come back. Unemployment remains high and the value of the dollar low. So, he raises taxes on who? Over 10% of Americans will be out of work. If some cut 10% of a 40 hour work week it would hurt their pay. But, that is exactly what Obama is doing, he is destroying the tax base, so you can not count on revenues from taxing people. He is also destroying our stock market, international market and bond market with his spending plan. So now he is hitting you in your pockets and in your accounts. GET REAL FOLKS!! If you really cared about your country and Pres. you would tell this idiot he is naked.

The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.

Where is her dignity and pride?Does she not think about her kids, who would be able to see her on that video when they grow up? I wouldn't do it to my child.This is insane. And whoever tell me that she does it for awareness will have to think twice about it. I wouldn't even know her name if media wouldn't be sticking her all over the papers. She won BB, i don't even like this programme, but it doesn't matter. Did she put any money towards charities, i doubt that. I think she has done enough to raise awareness about cancer, but filming her dying is discrace. Can government put some restrictions on it?

20090223035054AAmlyMr	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	So much for arctic ice disappearing, can GW folks shut up now?	The myth is dead folks, let it lie. A glitch in satellite sensors caused scientists to underestimate the extent of Arctic sea ice by 500,000 square kilometers (193,000 square miles), a California- size area, the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center said.      The error, due to a problem called “sensor drift,” began in early January and caused a slowly growing underestimation of sea ice extent until mid-February. That’s when “puzzled readers” alerted the NSIDC about data showing ice-covered areas as stretches of open ocean, the Boulder, Colorado-based group said on its Web site.      “Sensor drift, although infrequent, does occasionally occur and it is one of the things that we account for during quality- control measures prior to archiving the data,” the center said. “Although we believe that data prior to early January are reliable, we will conduct a full quality check.’’      The extent of Arctic sea ice is seen as a key measure of how rising temperatures are affecting the Earth. The cap retreated in 2007 to its lowest extent ever and last year posted its second- lowest annual minimum at the end of the yearly melt season.

If the banks were bailed out to recover the lost assets from non payment of mortgages lent to people who could not afford to pay back.   So in theory the banks will recover the assets from the people who get reposssesed, leaving that person out of pocket by perhaps thousands, and the lenders still getting there assets back through the property reposession. SO WHY BAIL THEM OUT is it just so the bankers can get their bonuses? Why not wait until they get there assets back. After all it was the banks that agree on the property value before they give the mortgage. the only looser in this game is mr joe blogs with a mortgage to pay

I've just changed schools and I've been hanging out with this group of strange people who are socially inept, but it's better than hanging out with idiots so i digress. Anyway, out of this group there's a girl who seems very distant from most people and barely talks.      I took pity upon this girl and decided to invite her to the beach with a few friends on the weekend. So, she showed up and everyone except for one of my friends couldn't come. So for the rest of the day I was left with her and my friend, and to cut the story short it was a rather fun day and in the end we all went back to her house to have a swim etc.      The next day I was happily content with listening to music in my house and catching up on a hell of a lot of homework. And then I hear a knock at the door and find that this girl is standing there...I started to find it a bit weird; seeing as I hadn't invited her at all. So, I wasn't prepared at all for her so I just went back to what I was doing earlier and let her stay with me in my room.      She stayed sitting on my bed for about an hour without saying much at all, it was about the most awkward thing of my life. After that I walked her back to her house and stayed there for a while feeling compelled to do so...      Anyway, now all she keeps doing (seeing as she has somehow gotten all of my contact details, and I hope not this yahoo answers account) is sending me txt, asking me why 'I'm not talking to her' on msn and reposting bulletins about me on myspace.      I swear to god, I'm as scared as I ever will be now. What the hell can I do or does anything need to be done at all, am I overreacting?

20090222235715AAvZWSf	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Firefighters, Police Officers, Correctional Officers, Probation Officers, etc: this question is for you?	First off, if you're reading this, thank you.       I'm going to explain this as clearly as I can. Like MOST people, I have experimented with some drugs, Marijuana(I hated it), and MDMA/Ecstasy which I'll admit to liking, but I never used them regularly just a handful of times for both. I'm 29 years-old. I wanted to go in to civil service from the time that I was in the first grade. Aside from the typical preadolescent dreams of being a professional athlete, I maintained that desire all the way until my senior year in high school when I slipped up, and dropped out.      Sometime after high school I discovered an artistic talent, and thoroughly educated myself in it, and decided to put my past failures behind me and move forward. Unfortunately, I made many other mistakes down this road, I butchered my credit because I was irreresponsible, I had a car repo'd due to an accident that I had, in which I had no insurance and thus the car was taken back, and I spent that night in the holding cell for "attemping to flee the scene". That resulted in a "no contest" plea on a MIDEMEANOR "hit and run"(property damage) charge. I got probation (2004). The other guy in the case whom actually hit me, then started to complain of pain a few months later, and I knew it was bogus, but he kept postponing anyhow, and one day I decided not to show up. I spent time in the L.A. County Jail in 2006 for that F.T.A.. I began to see things for what they 'were and weren't' IMMEDIATELY during my 4 days in jail. A year later, my daughter was born in 2007. I earned my GED last month, with all my scores ranging in the top 1%-14% with NO preparation. I applied to L.A. City Fire, just out of curiousity, and to my suprise 6-8 weeks later, I recieved a letter with a test date. Needless to say I wasn't prepared, so I postponed so that I could atleast get my GED. And, I have.      .IF I get my record exphunged and clean up my credit, do I have a realistic chance at a job in civil service?       The positives:      I have an accumulated 4 years of security experience. I know that isn't anything compared to REAL law enforcement, but you do learn about local laws, how to carry yourself, solving altercations, and proper procedure.      .No other legal issues.      .incorporated my own business in 2007 with the County.      .Very good physical shape.      .In-depth understanding of psychology/I'm a body language and speech reader.      .I'm mentally tough and cool under pressure.      .I've learned from MY mistakes. I wasn't taught accountability. I had to live and learn, and I did.      I'm willing to do anything. Exphunging my record is next, and I'm looking into getting a Certificate, getting a decent job, and then getting my B.S./B.A. from an accelerated course at a private University.       Will that save me, or is it too late?

20090223053213AAnltJU	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do Republicans pretend that the policy of running huge budget deficits, 'Starve the Beast', didn't exist?	This has been standard Republican policy since Reagan.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_...       The goal was to run MASSIVE budget deficits, and create a huge debt for our country. In this way, the money could not be 'wasted' on programs such as health care or education. This was achieved through major spending increases to defense (or anything but on the people) and major cuts in revenue (taxes).      What's ironic about this is that most people who claim to be Republicans act like their party is for LOW SPENDING and BALANCED BUDGETS.

20090223050655AA18t1m	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How many of you think Facebook, Myspace, or other social networking sites should be a basis for discipline?	I'm sure you're all aware of the fact that everyone from employers to school administrators to medical school admissions committees are using Facebook and others as a reason to fire/discipline/deny people's applications.  This seems a bit absurd to me, because the breadth of information available about any given person's personal life has increased exponentially with the use of camera phones and the previously mentioned sites.  I'm being serious when I ask, "What business is it of your employers if you get drunk on the weekend?" There used to be this unsaid rule that people could do whatever they wanted so long as it wasn't interfering with how they behaved or performed in the work place. Obama admits to smoking pot, but how much more damming would it be if we had pictures of him smoking a blunt back during his freshman year of college?  People would have had trouble voting for him or taking him seriously. That's the type of exposure that my generation is looking at.       Ok, let me know what you all think...

Currently the liberals have about 92% of the media market and a survey during the presidental election showed that over 90% of the journalists, who are supposed to be neutral, were openly supporting Nobama.

Hate to say it, but it is throwing money at a problem that they cannot fix.  Where in the US Constitution does it say that you should not be a renter?        Many people in the foreclosure mess are there because they put no money down on the house and financed 100% of their loan.  They were stretched thing to begin with and a mortgage straddled them with an $1200+ a month mortgage payment, of which $800+ a month goes to just interest.        What is wrong with renting?  Why do you want to be a homeowner if you can't afford repairs, interest, taxes, etc.  A leading financial analyst this morning was talking on the radio and said  that this is a much better situation for people and he cannot understand why they want to own a home.  If you want to own a home, go with something you can afford.  Not purchasing a $400,000+ home.

I know lots and lots of republicans who feel this way too. I also know democrats who don't believe in abortions either. For me, it isn't a political issue at all, but just a law issue.

20090223061701AAbXDZ3	Politics & Government;Politics	Do Republicans, rich and poor, have the wrong attitude towards economics?	For years, we've been taught that scoring the highest number of points is everything, from basketball, baseball, video games, freebies, shoes, so on and so forth.      We've never been taught how to approach an economy. I hear a lot of Republicans, and kids, for that matter, saying, "Why should I have to pay for some other guy's financial mistakes? I'm entitled to my money, and what I'm worth?"      Over the years, that's come to mean getting paid the maximum amount that you possibly can. Look at the Forbe's richest list and how that has perverted many CEO's. You don't think John Thain was looking to get on that list? He was saving up!      Like it or not, the economy has to be socialist in some way for it to work. Now, we don't have to put up the hammer and sickle and call everyone comrade, but something has to give for rich people. You don't just give people money; you can say, I'm giving you money, now make this for me so I can sell it, or do my landscaping, and you pay a fair price. That's how an economy functions. What's happening now is there are too many rich people hoarding their money, and wanting to provide only low-paying jobs, or none at all.      You are NOT entitled to your money, and you are responsible for the financial mistakes of others. One way or the other, no matter how rich you are, you are responsible. Your property values decline, the stock market declines, we are all a cog in the natural process called TRADE. When a few people don't do the right thing, the system breaks down!      The economy is a team game, much like basketball. Ball hogs like Allen Iverson and Steve Francis will make you a bad team.

Will our permanant residence still be the home my wife and I own, even if we were to rent it out while I was enlisted?  Reason I ask is that we were eligible for the first time homebuyer's tax credit, which has to be paid back over 15 years ($500 a year).  However if your home becomes a rental property, or a second home then balance is due that year.  I guess what Im trying to find out is if my house would be considered a rental property if it is still considered my primary residence while I am enlisted.  Quite confusing but thanks for any help.

Do they realize how moronic that is, those 2 things fit like a square peg in a round  hole.

Comparing this to a single families income and spending power is at best disingenuous and at worst retarded.

I wish nothing but death to these pieces of scum. Why? Because in spite of the illegality of weed, the hedonistic culture behind it, the fact that it causes cancer and mental illness, and the sickening truth about the vast amount of celebrities (and a certain Olympic swimmer who is #1 on my list of people who need to be shot) who use it, they continue to smoke it without guilt or respect for the law or anyone who doesn't smoke pot. They're a bunch of cowards who only find fun in smoking something that's putting them into an early grave. If I had my way, I'd have all pot smokers immediately destroyed. I know all non-stoners wouldn't mind.

20090223045919AAcGqrX	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Summer visitation with noncustodial parent.?	I am in the middle of going through a visitation battle with my son's father.  I have filed for full custody and joint legal custody (our son lives with me).  His father does not want full custody and we have agreed to a visitation schedule except for a one week visitation during June, July or August. I am trying to keep this out of court, but he is not willing to mediate.  He works nightshift Mon thru Fri and doesn't want any weeks visitation during the summer because he would have to find daycare.  Is this even worth paying money to fight in court?  I work dayshift and he provides care to him when he is not in school to avoid both of us paying daycare, so I kind of feel the judge will lean in his direction because he watches him while I work.  I might add at this time, he pays no child support and I provide all 100% financial needs.  Any thoughts?

20090223051209AAPQ6Vw	Politics & Government;Military	Can you get a Govt Civilian job if you have a general under honorable discharge for medical with other info?	The question is whether I can get a Govt Civilian job if I have a general discharge under honorable conditions.  I received a medical discharge due to a pre-existing condition from the marine Corp.  While I was waiting to be discharged my father had a severe heart attack and I told them I was leaving to go home.  They told me I would have to wait to get everything ok'd and that could take days.  I needed to get home and so I left.  I had already done all the paperwork and was waiting for the final out processing which, back then in the corp, could take months.  I got home and my father recovered and was doing better.  I was contacted by one of the officers that was doing my discharge and they told me to stay there and that they have finalized my papers and were sending them to me.  I was willing to go back and face punishment and await the rest of my time for my paperwork to be processed but again I was told just to stay home.  they mailed me my paperwork and I packed it away.  this was back in 1986.   Recently I applied for a Govt Position in the IT field.  They are requesting a copy of my DD214 page 4.  I brought the papers out of storage and looked at them.  The discharge is General under honorable conditions.  SEP code is JFM1(medical, pre-existing), and the RE code is 4(Can't enlist).  I did not sign the documents so in the signature block they put "see remarks" and in the remarks location is says "discharged while in absentia (unauthorized leave status)" with 22 days listed as being gone which of course would have been only about 10 days if they had not told me to stay home since I was being discharged.   My question is whether this will prevent me from getting a Govt Job or even a contractor job(clearance) on one of the bases in my home town.      Any information would be appreciated.

I'm going to apply for welfare because I need some money to tie me over until I get my next job. However job-hunting takes up most of my time and I don't have time to work for welfare benefits full-time while I'm still job hunting. Do I have to work in order to receive welfare benefits? What kinds of work do they make people do? Is it part-time or full-time?

They took Bush's 10 pg bailout and made it a monster in cost.      A 10-page piece of bailout legislation was hastily drafted and introduced. By the time the Senate finished with it, the bill had metastasized to more than 400 pages larded with custom-cut morsels of pork totally unrelated to the banking crisis but deemed necessary to buy the votes of House members whose support was needed for final passage. Both of Maine's senators voted for the steaming pile of pork pie, as did Sen. John McCain and then-Sen. Barack Obama.

Aren't there enough unskilled British citizens to take the unskilled jobs? My last job in a care home , I worked as kitchen assistant, alongside 2 filipino kitchen assistants.

There is a town next to my town that is FULL of factories, yet there are literally NO jobs going there. Why would the government allow all these UNSKILLED filipinos to take our unskilled jobs, when there are ALOT of people like myself who are born in britain and NEED a job A.S.A.P?

Another sob story about a black college sophomore that is struggling without enough government aid...      There are more, but I am sooo disgusted!

I am addressing this question to only those who are aware of the New World Order and who have educated themselves on the "dark side" of politics. I am a political activist and I am well aware about the threat of the New World Order. I am originally from America but my fiance is English. Since I found the truth about 9/11 and Bush's involvement I couldn't stay in America, especially when the majority of its citizens don't listen to the alternative story. I am well aware of the coming police state and I wanted out while I still had the chance. I live in England now but its no better here.. CCTV everywhere, barely any human rights. Neither of us want to stay here either. So what other countries are free of the U.N's control? I don't want to be ruled by Bilderburg and I don't want to live in the European Union or the North American Union... Where can we go? What country do I not have to worry about ending up in some FEMA camp for being a "domestic terrorist" since I know the truth.       And no nasty answers people. I only want people who have educated themselves and who do not just take their facts from the mainstream media.

Over the past 12 months, the government has pumped more than $2 trillion into initiatives to ease the nation's financial and economic crisis, driving the federal deficit to historic proportions.      But now, all of sudden, President Obama is singing a different tune. In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Obama told the nation: "We can't generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control."

Mercantilism is an economic system where power is based on wealth.   I have noticed that a lot of big organizations and powerful people all have a lot of money.  I also notice that a lot of bribes are springing up in the government.  Most companies go into business for a profit, not necessarily to to spread a good product (with the exception of non-profit organizations).  Do you think we are moving back to the age of exploration, when power was based on how much money you had?

Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), already in political trouble for 2010, didn’t help matters any over the weekend.      At a Lincoln Day Dinner speech over the weekend, Bunning predicted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would likely be dead from pancreatic cancer in nine months, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.      The paper reports that Bunning reiterated his support of conservative judges, saying “that’s going to be in place very shortly because Ruth Bader Ginsburg…has cancer.”      “Bad cancer. The kind you don’t get better from,” Bunning went on. “Even though she was operated on, usually nine months is the longest that anybody would live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.”

Chile has the highest Human Development Index in the last 2008 ONU report with an HDI of 0,874.       After there's Argentina with 0,860, Mexico with 0,847 and Brazil with 0,807. The HDI combines three basic dimensions:      * Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity   * Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).   * Standard of living, as measured by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) in United States dollars.

Why not take all of these 30 year mortgages, and change them over into 50 year mortgages with a comparative mortgage rate and a mortgage insurance attachment.  The monthly payment would drop to an affordable range and the banks are still guaranteed to get the agreed upon price for the home.  If a person still cannot afford a 50 year monthly rate than they should not be there anyway and they can be foreclosed on.  In twenty years the price will be back up where it was and the owners can sell and break even.  Much better than foreclosing or government bailouts right?

My friend is deciding to go Army National Guard and I am deciding to go Air Force Active.      I just want to know the positive aspects and negative aspects of each when compared to one another. I saw Air Force active as a better opportunity for life in the future than something temporary like Army National Guard, known as the "Weekend Warriors".      Do you think that if you had a choice to stay as a civilian than go to army reserves you would stay?      I heard not to go unless you had a choice. Military is something to fall back on when everything else seems to not be an option or not able to work out. I'm going to use the Air Force for the education but my friend is going in for the bonus and everyone else he recruits. will he be able to support himself later even after joining? He is set on life but he seems to be impatient on waiting for life to settle down like all the debt he owes. He has an option of waiting it out and busting his butt to pay it off but hes taking the easy way out.      I just need personal opinions, advice to help my bro out. I think hes just making the wrong decision. Maybe hes doing it for the money? he said its because he wants to do it, the bonus, people he recruits means more money, sets his life up for the future, likes the physical activity. There are a lot of options open for him but hes taking the easy way out in my opinion.

Anyone out there familiar with this subject please give me some advice :)       i have no criminal records, my marriage is not fake, and i'm not a terrorist.. or anything that they should be worried about.. this whole Visa screening process(which is known to be long) is undestandable and yet annoying at the same time.. as an educated, well raised non-criminal person who didn't just get married for the green card.. i feel like it's just unfair that i cant be reunited with my husband asap. sorry about venting :) thanks in advance for any kind advice!

That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”                   This quote is from Hermann Goering.  Second in comand to Adolf hitler.

Most people agree that the reason its legal is that it cant be taxed.   Well i know its something bigger.   In norther parts of Ca, they have coffee shops(much like those in Amsterdam) were you can purchase bud in a somewhat safe enviroment. Now when i say somewhat safe, i mean you dont have to find some neighbor hood drug dealer that you dont even know.   See i look at it as the goverment is always going to try to stop the drug running, but that isnt going to stop people(example:me) from getting the green goodness. So i think that there is a way to properly purchase and sell pot. What do you guys think??

Several years ago, people would use BLEACH to whiten their teeth... and their teeth DID whiten QUICKLY in the SHORT TERM.      Of course the LONG TERM effect was that the bleach destroyed the enamel layer over the teeth, and the teeth actually ROTTED away.  In time, people realized that the best solution was DAILY  effort to brush and keep up their teeth with small efforts done repeatedly over time.      BEHOLD the Obama Stimulus Plan.....     a crap-load of spending that MIGHT help in the short term.... but in the LONG TERM, we can not escape the ROT of our entire financial and economic system.

20090223070439AAmfMYE	Politics & Government;Elections	HOW will MOST Americans FEEL when MANY months go by and they STILL HAVEN'T SEEN ANY RESULT OF HIS SPEND SPREE?	Most of his spend spree won't even be felt for years later- Likely after the crisis is over. I think Obama is confused over the word "stimulus." You don't stimulate something years later after it's recovered or already dead.      Here are some examples of how the money won't be felt for a very long time to come:      . Look at the numbers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that about $200 billion will be spent in 2011 or later -- after it would do the most good. For starters, there's $8 billion for high-speed rail. "Everyone is saying this is (for) high-speed rail between Los Angeles and Las Vegas -- I don't know," says Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association. Whatever's done, the design and construction will occupy many years. It's not a quick stimulus.      Then there's $20.8 billion for improved health information technology -- more electronic records and the like. Probably most people regard this as desirable, but here, too, changes occur slowly. The CBO expects only 3 percent of the money ($595 million) to be spent in fiscal 2009 and 2010. The peak year of projected spending is 2014 at $14.2 billion.

CHICAGO - Illinois Congressman Phil Hare says the people of Illinois have had enough and it's time for U.S. Sen. Roland Burris to step down.      During an appearance on CNN on Friday, Hare said Burris made a mistake in accepting an appointment to the Senate from now ousted Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.      And Hare says questions about whether Burris' testimony during Blagojevich's impeachment hearing was complete make the situation worse.      Hare says the focus should be on helping Illinoisans deal with important issues, such as the economy and home foreclosures, instead of the controversy surrounding Burris.

If these public servants can't put the dire needs of country and state above party, then perhaps Arizona should go to the back of the line when what McCain and Kyl call pork is handed out for infrastructure, energy efficiency, schools, tax cuts and social-safety-net measures.

20090223071344AALp1ij	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Gas station not wanting to pay for their mistake, what can I do?	I have a diesel truck and back in November I went to a full service gas station.  The boy came out and pumped my gas for me.  About 5 minutes after he was pumping he stopped the pump and told me that he had put gas in my diesel truck.  He went to his boss and his boss gave him some stuff to pour in the tank and told him to tell me everything would be fine, there would be no damages, but if there was in the next few days he would pay for it.  Well I was advised to take my truck in anyway because it could have done something and it was better to have it checked out now then to wait and cause more damage.  So I called the owner of the gas station and told him I was taking it in and he said he would not pay for it there was no need.  I got to the dealerships shop and told them what had happened and they said it may have done damage or it may not have but the only way to find out is to flush it out and check everything.  That it would be cheaper now than later if it causes more probelms.  So I called the gas station back and even had the service man talk to him and he still refused.  So anyway I had to file this on insurance and my insurance said they would go after him to get their money back and my deductible back.  Now my insurance has turned it over to their lawyers to try and get the money back, the owner of the gas station is saying that the incident never happened at his gas station he didnt know what they were talking about.  Over the weekend I noticed that same boy was working so I stopped in to try and get a statement from him and he told me he had to ask his boss first and that his boss told him he is not to even talk to me.  So now I am wondering what can I do?  He should not get away with this but I have no clue what I can do.

20090223072148AALWePZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I have a friend who was stopped in Connecticut for "traveling in the fast lane". Can he successfully fight it?	Details of the case: My friend, much like myself, is from Massachusetts where traveling in the fast is not a moving violation that is strictly enforced. In fact, I have never heard of anyone in my state getting stopped for such a moving violation, and the whole thing just sounds a bit bogus. Secondly, the officer decided to pat down my friend without probable cause, then proceeded to pop my friend's trunk without even asking his permission to open it while my friend sat on the curb in front of the guard rail. The officer was extremely rude and unprofessional to my friend.  However, my friend was stupid enough to bring a small bag of cannabis with him (he's not a drug dealer/trafficker, just a mild, occasional pothead and has NO criminal records at all), which the officer found in the center console of his car. The officer decided to let him off easy and only charged him with "traveling in the fast lane". Which begs the following question: can and should my friend fight this ticket? Yes, he screwed up and brought a small baggie of weed with him, and yes, he was guilty of "traveling in the fast lane", but he doesn't want his insurance premium to go up. Can he fight this ticket successfully? And should he worry about the cop trying to bring up new charges against him in the trail hearing for the ticket (only charged for traveling in the fast lane as mentioned previously)? As far I know, police officers cannot invoke or bring new charges to any case/hearing if the person was not charged for it in the first place. Lastly, is there a viable way to fight this ticket, and if so, what can my friend say in his defense?

20090223073941AAySPMU	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Court continuance - prosecutor gave me a new date?	I went to court this morning for driving with a suspended license (long story short, outstanding fine I didn't take care of right away, so they suspended it).      I told the prosecutor I send the check to the DMV to reinstate it. He told me it'd take a bit for the DMV to reinstate the license. "Case continues on 3/19."      After that, I left, but now I'm wondering. I haven't ever been to court. Do I need to be present for the date on my case to be moved? Do I need to enter a plea yet? He didn't ask me what my plea was, after all.
