KWhKwgsSaa	This is a good make ahead dish -- a friend from church gave me the recipe after our Mother/Daughter banquet ... which she catered.  Everyone raved over this dish.  I guess one reason it was so good was because she made it the day before, then reheated it, and the chicken marinated all night in the cranberry mixture.  It was moist and VERY tasty.    Cranberry Chicken  12 - 15 chicken breasts, boneless skinless  1 bottle Catalina salad dressing, small bottle  1 can whole berry cranberry sauce  1 package dry onion soup mix    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Spray 9x 13" baking dish with non stick spray. Place chicken in baking dish. Pour salad dressing over chicken, sprinkle with dry onion soup mix, top with cranberry sauce. Cover with foil.    Bake for one hour. Remove foil, baste chicken, return to oven and continue to bake for 30 minutes.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Lemon garlic chicken:    Use bone in and skin on chicken quarters.

I also find that if I want thin crust that working with individual pies is easier than trying to work with a larger piece of dough.|`|AA11547306	Roll the dough between two sheets of wax paper.  When you have it at the thinnest you desire, pull off the top sheet and dust lightly with flour and roll gentle again just to impress the flour into the dough.  You will loose about 75% of the shrinkage you talk about.  This is how I make my Pizza dough at home.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Let it rest a while so it can relax a bit.  Also if you just took it out of the refrigerator, you'll get better results if used as room temp.      You'll need to stretch it out a bit too, don't totally rely on the roller.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	use a rolling pin....    otherwise. let it rise and make sure it's at room temp. it shouldn't be doing that, did you follow the recipe correctly?
IDBasYahaa	all honey will give you approximatly the same sweetness, some just have stronger charictoristis. e.g. red gum (australian eucalypt) has a very strong & unique flavour.|`|SpcYCBndaa	ALFALFA   Alfalfa honey, produced extensively throughout Canada and the United States from the purple blossoms, is light in color with a pleasingly mild flavor and aroma.       AVOCADO   Avocado honey is gathered from California avocado blossoms. Avocado honey is dark in color, with a rich, buttery taste.       BLUEBERRY   Taken from the tiny white flowers of the blueberry bush, the nectar makes a honey which is typically light amber in color and with a full, well-rounded flavor. Blueberry honey is produced in New England and in Michigan.     BUCKWHEAT   Buckwheat honey is dark and full-bodied. It is produced in Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as well as in eastern Canada. Buckwheat honey has been found to contain more antioxidant compounds than some lighter honeys.       CLOVER   Clover honey has a pleasing, mild taste. Clovers contribute more to honey production in the United States than any other group of plants. Red clover, Alsike clover and the white and yellow sweet clovers are most important for honey production. Depending on the location and type of source clover, clover honey varies in color from water white to light amber to amber.       EUCALYPTUS   Eucalyptus honey comes from one of the larger plant genera, containing over 500 distinct species and many hybrids. As may be expected with a diverse group of plants, eucalyptus honey varies greatly in color and flavor but tends to be a stronger flavored honey with a slight medicinal scent. It is produced in California.       FIREWEED   Fireweed honey is light in color and comes from a perennial herb that creates wonderful bee pasture in the Northern and Pacific states and Canada. Fireweed grows in the open woods, reaching a height of three to five feet and spikes attractive pinkish flowers.       MANUKA   Manuka honey, primarily produced in New Zealand, is used as a natural product both internally and topically on the skin. The bees gather nectar from the flowers of the Manuka bush, which is indigenous only to New Zealand. The honey making process is enriched by the pollution free environment of New Zealand.       ORANGE BLOSSOM   Orange blossom honey, often a combination of citrus sources, is usually light in color and mild in flavor with a fresh scent and light citrus taste. Orange blossom honey is produced in Florida, Southern California and parts of Texas.       SAGE   Sage honey, primarily produced in California, is light in color, heavy bodied and has a mild but delightful flavor. It is extremely slow to granulate, making it a favorite among honey packers for blending with other honeys to slow down granulation.       TUPELO   Tupelo honey is a premium honey produced in northwest Florida. It is heavy bodied and is usually light golden amber with a greenish cast and has a mild, distinctive taste. Because of the high fructose content in Tupelo honey, it granulates very slowly.       WILDFLOWER   Wildflower honey is often used to describe honey from miscellaneous and undefined flower sources.       HONEY BLENDS   While different types of honey are available, most honey, especially honey supplied in bulk, is blended to create a unique and consistent taste and color.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	I would reccommend Manuka Honey.
hHCdXq0Naa	A tea light isn't hot enough to melt it down; just keep it warm.  I'd melt 1 or 2 8-oz. pkgs of cream cheese with the shredded or cubed cheese, until it's smooth and blended.  You could always add some chopped jalapenos and Tabasco sauce to it too|`|AA12395636	Fondue is more than just melted cheese. Find a basic recipe on line.  You cook in on the stove and just keep it warm in the fondue pot. You may need more than a tea light too. Sterno is what we use.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	you need something hotter than a little tea light.    i'd add different kinds of cheeses and seasonings to make it into the taste you want, you can add whatever you want.    if you're using the buffalo chicken wing cheese you can add jalapeno cheese and tabasco sauce.    sounds good!
BMBFXXPmaa	Whole grains like brown rice and pasta is good for you.  Its the processed flour, pasta that is bad.    I've been on a healthy eating lifestyle since Jan '08 and lost 45 lbs.  I don't count calories, it's more about portion control.  Started cause my cholesterol and blood sugar was high; its been normal for a few months now.    Everyone has their own likes and dislikes in food.    I listed Ways to a healthy lifestyle way of eating that helped:    Nutritious foods that are high in nutrients and low in fat and sugar (no sugar, if possible).     Substituting sugar and oil (partially, depends on the recipe) by using applesauce and pureed fruits in baked goods.    Eating veggies as the main dish and lean meats (including beans), fish and chicken (very little red meat) as a side dish.    Eating whole wheat rice, pasta and breads is good as a side dish or as part of the main dish, as long as it is not high in fat, but is high in fiber. Lots of times, breads and pasta will say its wheat when it isn't whole wheat; something to watch out for.    Eating 3 meals plus 2 snacks a day is good.    Staying away from fast foods and tv dinners laden with fat and sugar.    Key is finding what kinds of foods you like; going to the American Heart Association website as a guideline.    Then looking at recipes that appeal to you.    I made a binder, with plastic sheet pocket protector page with index pages (salads, meats, side dishes, desserts, etc.).

88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	The advantage of the porcelain-coated ones over seasoned cast iron has to do with cooking acidic foods.  In even a well-seasoned cast iron pot, acidic foods will pick up a metallic taste if in the pot for as little as 20 minutes (think tomato-based products like chili, spaghetti sauce, and citrus-based sauces for chicken or pork).  You won't have that issue with a porcelain-coated pot.|`|7cUDstdjaa	If you are happy with you bare cast iron pots, stick with them. The only advantage I can see in porcelain coated ware is that it does not need seasoning. I think it could also get chipped if it gets dropped, then it becomes a health hazard.  Also, a well seasoned pot retains flavour.|`|36a3ynpJaa	The main down side is the price.   They are great to cook with though because the weight heats the food evenly and they are much easier to clean than plain cast iron. Also no rust.   If I was to get it, I would look on Ebay, since buying new is crazy for price and they last for 50 years.    Best for casseroles and foods that simmer.  It's not what I'd want to make scrambled eggs in though.  They are a bit heavy for things that are quick to make.    $250 for a four piece set!  http://nextpowerusa.stores.yahoo.net/lec...

DH6b6coXaa	HA this is funny to me because NO ONE who lives south of Indiana and Ohio really knows what you are talking about. I used to be in MI and we did all the open house things. I moved south and no one has any clue what i am talking about but wonders why they don't do it!     Fact is, it's going to cost money no matter where you have it with all the stuff you have to get. Most all of my family did it at their own home (inside or out-you can rent a tent at a hardware store) or in a hall. You could go to the nearest park too. Most parks have pavilions.    If you have a lot of friends/family/church family...you could always have them bring one of your favorite dishes that they make (kinda potluck-ish) that is a real money saver.  My family/friends did themes. Hawaiian, fiesta, carnival/etc...with the food that goes along with the theme or you can just traditional open house with sandwiches n such. you can have punch or pop (yes pop to all y'all southerners ;p  )     it is smart to make a box for your cards (if you are expecting a lot of people) SAFER! you'd be surprised how bad people can be about that kinda stuff.     hope this helps. if you have more questions email me because i don't know who all will understand open house stuff!! haa haa

HoHHpwDlaa	Hey :]    So most likely, your local shop is going to have some awesome coals or some super crappy coals.  Naturals are always best. Quicklights are good if you're in a rush, but they're filled with chemicals and smell kinda yucky.     Try and see if they have any Exoticas or some ChronicHookah Coals. Some people like coconaras. ive never tried them myself. If your local place has any of these brands, then that's famazing.     But if they dont, try these online vendors. I've used two of them. :  --www.nazarhookah.com (i've used this vendor, they sell the Exotica coals, very professional)  --www.hookahjohn.com (never used, but really nice guy. He sells the ChronicHookah coals.)  --www.thehookah.com (i've used this vendor before, they sells the CocoNara coals)    Anyhow, here's a place that has TONS of reviews on coals.:  http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/forumdisp...  They break it down into Type, Brand, Smell, Taste, Longevity and all that good stuff.  Thats how i found out about the Exoticas.     Hope i helped at least a little :]|`|2c8MZxS4aa	A reputible online dealer should be sending you some. Like Hookah Shisha Central, they send EVERYTHING you need to get started.  http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/ma...    Most Local Smoke Shops should have some. But when you go there are two basic categories of coals    Quicklights - You can light them with a lighter.  http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/vi...  Golden's are the best out there. Downside of quicklights is they have a heavy coal taste.    Natural - You light them on a stove or with a butane torch  http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/vi...  Coconara's are the best, they are all I use, downside they take about 5 minutes to light, but it's worth it!|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Of course you can go to any smoke shop and you can find coals or tobacco or anything for a hookah.

Though you should go easy on the sugar as you don't want to develop diabetes.|`|prMwhfsxaa	Green tea is healthy.  Adding sugar is probably not helping though.
A5mCd8qBaa	What you have there is a rich white wine cream sauce.  The Olive Garden doesn't even bottle it for it's own use... the sauce is made fresh at each location daily (part of the reason it is so tasty).    That's the bad news... you can't buy it bottled.  The good news is that it is not difficult to make yourself.  I came up with a version of a white wine cream sauce that it very good and the recipe is as follows:    Ingredients:  1 cup heavy whipping cream   3/4 cup white wine   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   1 teaspoon dried parsley     Directions:  1. In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine the cream, wine, flour, salt and parsley. Stir all together bring to a boil.   2. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened.     That last step is crucial.  If you don't get that heat down it could scorch the sauce and you'll have to start over.    The sauce may not taste exactly like what they are using at Olive Garden but with some experimentation you should be able to get pretty close (and experimenting is one of the more enjoyable things to do in the kitchen... you may even come up with a variation of your own that you like better than theirs).    Good luck and bon appetit.
ylJoUuMDaa	My word, that is one helluva big ham.  I hope lots of people are coming for dinner-lol.  Just roast it at 325 for 15 min. a pound.  Hams are already cooked (read the label) so it's really just a matter of heating it up.  Decorate with pineapple rings, cherries and a mustard/brown sugar glaze.|`|IlScDuAiaa	if your ham is an uncooked ham I would advise you to cook it for about 4 hrs at 350degrees. Lots of hams though are already cooked and all you have to do is heat it for about 1hr. When you cook it put pinneapple juice on he bottom of the roaster or some other type of juice rather than plain old water. Also it wouldn't hurt to buy yourself a thermometer. Mine always comes in handy when in doubt. Enjoy!!!!!|`|7916c4d17333b435a55f05340490ade1aa	30 MINUTES PER POUND AT 400 DEGREES F

thoMmZAvaa	You wouldn't be able to buy that in a grocery store, making it would require some skill (layering the cakes, making fillings and cutting layers in individual cakes, rolling fondant and hand decoration). If you know someone who is adept with baking, they could certainly experiment with a small cake to learn to do the fondant (which isn't very hard), but definitely need some experience to put the whole thing together. It looks like a three layer fondant covered cake, which means it probably has a filling of fruit and/or buttercream. The decorative isn't very complicated, just a ribbon, handpainted chess board, some chess pieces and a flower. You might be able to get it for about 80- 100 (undecorated), 150 as it is, it's very hard to tell how big it really is from the pic), I'm assuming it'll serve about 30-40 people. Decorating yourself wouldn't be hard, you'd need edible food paint, some nice ribbon, food grade flowers (no pesiticides used) and the extra decorations (chess pieces and a fake apple).|`|grPckwSsaa	what could you possible need a twilight back for?    and that would definitely need to be recreated by a specialty cake store, a grocery would not make this|`|l1BNyWjcaa	it is very pretty i would say 50-150 dollars|`|MS6IzOPLaa	It would be easy to make if you had cake decorating experience.

In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Push craft sticks into the center of each ball. Place balls, with sticks parallel to the cookie sheet, 3 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten them slightly using the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. This is the time to decorate with sprinkles or colored sugar if you desire.   Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. When cookies are completely cool, wrap in plastic wrap and tie with a pretty ribbon.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	i would think you put the sticks in the cookie before you bake. i think the ones that have a point at the end- that you use for candy apples. they sell at grocery store. but you can use popsicle sticks if you want to eat the pops first!

17k4RVdJaa	Depends on where you get your MSG. If you get it from chicken/beef stock, it is not vegetarian.  But pure MSG is basically just salt with glutamate (amino acid). They were obtained from seaweed. Although now they obtain MSG from carbohydrate fermentation:    "MSG is normally obtained by the fermentation of carbohydrates, using bacteria species from genera such as Brevibacterium, Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, and Corynebacterium. Yields of 100 g/litre can be prepared in this way. From 1909 to the mid 1960s, MSG was prepared by the hydrolysis of wheat gluten, which is roughly 25% glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is one of the least soluble amino acids, which facilitates its purification."|`|tYkMQngPaa	MSG is a salt and salt is a mineral, however, MSG is also present in Tomatoes in a natural form but, that doesn't mean it is vegetable as many vegetables contain minerals.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	yes it is vegetarian.   Monosodium glutamate, also known as sodium glutamate and MSG, is a sodium salt of the non-essential amino glutamic acid.     if you are reading ingredients why not go vegan?      glycerine and stear (as in stearate) are 2 of the most common animal by-products|`|p5hvth7zaa	Yeaa..but its bad for you  =]

How about powdered egg whites?  Or for one egg 1/4 cup banana or applesauce.  Last resort is 1/4 cup mayonnaise.  EDIT: 1 egg = 1/4 cup. So you will want to use the same amount of liquid (you can do 2T mayo and 2T milk, water, or oil though).  Mayo tastes fine in brownies!|`|5vv9oD9zaa	Ooooh oooh I know this one! I hate it when you google egg substitute and it just gives you a bunch of egg substitute products.    Really a tablespoon or so of mayo or applesauce is fine. I have used the mayo before, just don't tell people that's what you did or they'll think it's weird too. It really keeps it moist though! After all, mayo is made from eggs.

m0a7Ox1maa	There are no mystic herbal ingrediants in Green Tea.  Green Tea is regular (Black) tea leaves that are not roasted till they turn black.  White Tea is the first step - no roast, green tea is second and black tea is the final process result.    The roasting reduces the antioxidents, so green tea is better for you then black because of the antioxident levels - this what has given you the idea that there are other ingrediants in Green Tea.  White tea is better then green tea for the same reason|`|Gl0fPErtaa	tea|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Tea leaves.

And i guess then the yellow would be the sky but dont pay any attention to that. Then the bottom you can make a line wavy line w.e with bron frosting like 2 inches above the bottom of the cake and then under the line frost it with brown. That could be the sand. then you can make a palm tree beside it. And beach balls. Then get blue frosting and above the brown do i wavy line 2 inches above the brown and then frost inside the blue. That could be the ocean. And you can do different blues and greens inside the ocean like wavy lines. You can make fish and shells 2. Then with orange or w.e color you want you can make a sun thats half way into the ocean for a sunset. Then in the yellow sky make birds and clouds or something. Hope i helped!

DgTyjM0maa	wine will last forever if you dont un cork it but once you uncork it you should drink it with in a week or so cause it will go bad.....|`|AA10025824	If it's sealed it will last a while, but re-cork it and lay in on its side, the moisture will keep the cork expanded and it will stay sealed.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Red wine should be served at about 45 degrees. You're also supposed to aerate it by pouring it through an aerator and into a carafe. But, it's fine right out of the bottle.    Once it starts to warm up and after it gets exposed to the air, red wine starts to undergo chemical changes that affect it's flavor. The warmth and the air cause the wine to start to turn to vinegar. The exposure to the air also makes the wine start to taste stale. If you just left an opened bottle of red wine sitting out for a day or two, you would definitely notice the change in the flavor. And, after the second day, I doubt it would even be drinkable.|`|aa7932143314ae59c91eb730b8572e37aa	It really depends. By opening the wine, you have introduced air, so even if you 'recork' it, there is air In there and it will oxidise the wine.     Wine will last for years IF STORED PROPERLY, but once you've opened it, that's it.     If you can't drink it quickly enough, just use it for cooking.     I'm amazed you could open a bottle of wine and consider keeping it for longer than the next day...|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Forever if you leave the cork on!|`|AA11865682	3 days absolute maximum whether you put the cork back in the bottle or not.    This depends largely on the quality of the wine so here's my personal rule:    IF it lasts the night - re-seal the bottle and put it in a dark cool place (a cupboard will do. Not above the kettle)    Next day - will almost definitely be ok to drink. Attempt to finish the bottle.    Day two - taste first to determine drink-ability. If it has oxidised, cook with it.    day three - tip it out.|`|yyXs05kwaa	wine can last years if you keep the cork on, it depends what type of wine it is, if you leave the cork off it'll go bad in a few days most likely.    hope i helped|`|AA10922449	Less than one week.

NwYwLdsNaa	Flounder Fish Facts   Flounder are an excellent fish to bring home for dinner as they provide a great taste and are very healthy.  Catching flounder and fluke are not as easy as it is said, but with a little experience you can put these dinner delights in your cooler.    Flounder are known as the flatfish of the ocean and can be found all over the United States but primarily on the East Coast.  Flounder are also fished for in Europe, Canada, and throughout the Pacific Ocean.    Fishing and cooking  Flounder fishing is best in spring and autumn. Flounder may be caught in summer, but the meat will be soft and unpleasant for eating. Flounder will bite at almost anything used for fish bait, including any kind of tackle. Use a small hook; No. 8 being the recommended size. Flounder are an excellent pan fish, but they should be cooked as soon as possible after being caught|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Flounder is a fish, and healthy.

Llm59P4Faa	As for soda in general it's because of the high contents of sugar. Sugar can help when you're sick since it's real helpful in states of shock and similar. Also, if you have problems with nausea it can help you burp which might make you feel a tad better. Those parts would be true, I suppose, but the statement that soda's good for you when you're sick isn't true because there are too many varieties of sicknesses. In some cases it might be good and in many cases it won't be good at all or maybe even directly bad.    If we aren't talking about soda in general but certain types they have their uses. Coke without bubbles can help with nausea, I guess it's because of the acids. Sprite can be good for a sore throat or similar because it'll help you get you nice and slimey.

The idea comes from the fact that ginger helps calm the stomach.  Which it does.  But mass-produced ginger ale contains NO (read: NONE AT ALL) ginger, just sugar, carbonation, and artificial flavours.  If anything, it's making it worse because of all the sugar, it isn't good for your body.  Water is best.    Try some ginger tea instead.    As for other sodas, I've never heard that.

GNtsdk4saa	Go to www.allrecipes.com and use their ingredient search for "venison."  It's my favorite recipe website.  Here's just one example for you:    INGREDIENTS   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon salt   1/2 teaspoon pepper   3 pounds boneless shoulder venison roast   2 tablespoons vegetable oil   1 cup apple juice or cider   1 cup beef broth   1 medium onion, sliced   1 teaspoon dried thyme   1 bay leaf   8 small potatoes, peeled   6 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces   4 celery ribs, cut into 2-inch pieces     Combine the first three ingredients; rub over roast. In a Dutch oven, brown roast on all sides in oil. Add apple juice, broth, onion, thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Add potatoes, carrots and celery; cover and simmer for 1 hour or until meat and vegetables are tender. Discard bay leaf. Thicken pan juices if desired.|`|TZCVc9vyaa	This is how I do it in my slow cooker.  In the morning I put the roast in the slow cooker and put a package of onion soup mix on top of the roast.  Then I put a can of mushroom soup right on top of the meat...not mixed in the slow cooker because I scrape it off once the roast is done.  The mushroom soup helps take the game taste out of the meat.  Turn your slow cooker on low and let it coook all day.  Once its done like I said I scrape all the mushroom soup off.

Besides, tofu is versatile and delicious when prepared well, and the fat from Bambi will shorten your life as it clogs your arteries.    Do yourself a huge favor, and let Bambi enjoy a playful life on the grass.|`|AA12095483	Venison is a very dry meat, so it helps if you 'lard' if before roasting. If you have a larding needle, cut thin strips of fat from bacon and thread them under the surface of the roast. If you don't have a larding needle, place several pieces of fat bacon over the roast and secure them in place with toothpicks.   Because venison is wild meat, it should be well cooked - rare meat can have parasites etc. in it, so thorough cooking is a must.   When you roast it, put it in a roasting pan that has a cover on it and keep it covered for all but the last half hour. At that point, you can take the cover off so the top of the roast will brown.   Enjoy!

Plants have feelings, plants communicate, plants feel, plants know when something bad is happening to them.     Dead chickens don't scream before they go into the fryer, but vegetables go into the boiling soup pot WHILE STILL ALIVE! We know plants are terrified at times like that. Just because they can't scream does not mean they don't feel pain and trauma.    It's time for us to speak for those plants who can't scream for themselves We are going to put Pam Anderson's butt on our calander and  auction off Paris Hilton's panties to raise money.

A lot of vegetarians are trying to reduce the suffering they cause. A plant doesn't suffer. It is incapable of suffering or feeling sadness, because it cannot think or feel. If you hurt an animal, it feels grief and pain, just like we do when we are hurt. Many of us believe that eating a plant-based diet is better for your health. I can testify that I feel great and I almost never get sick, and I believe it is due to my being vegetarian. There are other reasons too: some religions promote vegetarianism, some don't like the taste of meat, and some stop eating meat because of its effect on the environment. I hope I helped you to understand.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	Wow people never get sick of asking this question do they.

Animals have the same emotions as humans - they feel fear, rejection, guilt, jealousy, happiness, joy, love, anger, depression.  We have no idea whether plants do.  Animals think, we have no idea if plants do.    Animals have exactly the same nervous system, heart, lungs, blood, muscles, bones as we do.  We know what physical suffering they endure when they're treated badly and then killed.  We have no idea what plants experience when they are killed.  A lot of carnivores don't care if animals are killed but are upset when humans are killed.  A lot of vegetarians don't care if plants are killed but are upset when animals are killed.  By your reasoning its ok to kill humans and eat them because something has to die for you to live. ?????  Most people think killing humans is worse than killing animals, and most people think killing animals is worse than killing plants.  So the aim of vegetarianism is to do the least harm.  It takes a lot more plants to feed cows to feed humans, than it does for humans to eat plants directly.  So vegetarians kill far less plants than meat-eaters.    Some vegetarians would rather not eat plants, but have to eat something to live.  Its a question of minimising the suffering you inflict.  It's not possible to eliminate it entirely.
NNiN0tK0aa	It dries food by blowing air on it, it's like cooking but at a very low temperature (the air doesn't feel warm although the food does warm slightly if left in a long time) so it takes a very long time - 12 - 24 hours is average.  It means enzymes are not destroyed, so dehydrated food can sometimes seem cooked but have the enzymes of raw food.  You can make absolutely delicious food with one, that is similar to cooked food.  Google for shops that sell them.  If you want to dry vegetables or herbs you can sometimes use the old fashioned method of hanging from the ceiling but for proper gourmet dishes there really isn't anything else you can use in my experience.

I enjoy Pepsi products more than coke ones. Coke burns my throat, makes my eyes water and fizzies my nose. I don't willingly have those things done to me on purpose.

Opinions may differ on that one (although the correct answer is "Coke"). But there's no room for argument as to which company turned in the better results this week. This round goes to Coca-Cola, hands down .Volumeme sales of the sugary syrup that goes into making Coke's heavenly beverage increased 3% in the third quarter of 2008, and revenues grew 9%.  Meanwhile, earnings per share rocketed 14% year over year, to $0.81.      Contrast that with PepsiCo's results: Volume shipped increased only 2% year over year in Q3, while revenues increased 11%.  Meanwhile, earnings per share declined 6% to $0.99    The contrast is stark, and Mr. Market quickly made known his opinion of the relative results. Since reporting earnings Tuesday morning, Pepsi's already down more than 10%. Coke, on the other hand, jumped on the news and has since receded in the midst of the volatile markets    Belated apologies ...   ... for the crack about Coke tasting better than Pepsi. I know -- opinions differ, and that's why both Coke and Pepsi sell so well around the world. But if both products remain popular, how is it that Coke fares so much better than its archrival? Let's start with the similarities.    In their reports, both companies say they are taking "productivity initiatives" to save roughly $400 million or more each in annual pre-tax costs. Both explain the move as being in response to "challenging" conditions in the U.S. market, while emphasizing emerging markets as key to growth -- in part because a weak U.S. dollar continues to boost foreign revenues and profits.    However, Pepsi sees currency exchange rate fluctuations from those emerging markets hurting its profits in Q4, while Coke "continues to expect at least a mid-single-digit favorable currency impact on full year 2008 operating income." Furthering the contrast, Pepsi goes to great pains in its report to explain how much better its results would look but for "Mark-to-Market Net Losses on Commodity Hedges." Here, I fear Pepsi has been caught by surprise by the marked downturn in commodities prices -- a development that has helped destroy market capitalization at agro-dependent enterprises from Monsanto to Intrepid Potash, Mosaic, and PotashCorp.    In contrast, the only time Coke mentions hedging is in that line about how hedging its currency position will preserve its profits (at least through year's end.) And therein, I suspect, lies the answer to our question. While the specifics remain unclear, Coke appears to be hedging currency, and perhaps commodity, risks better than Pepsi has done.|`|1gr3PR7Iaa	they both have there goods and bads|`|nN4ldjcBaa	coke n sprite|`|eAnBIwfJaa	Coke...|`|7r53ftKWaa	coke

xrRZeROmaa	Chow Mein is aptly described above.  In the Us, according to Wikipedia, the below note is added.    Chow mein is mentioned as early as 1920, in the novel Main Street by Sinclair Lewis.[2]    If you are talking about fortune cookies, then Wikipedia has a couple of ideas.    As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the American Fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion.[1]      A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil with a "fortune" wrapped inside. A "fortune" is a piece of paper with words of faux wisdom or a vague prophecy. In the United states of America and Canada (although also available in other parts of the Western world), it is usually served with Chinese food in Chinese restaurants as a dessert. The message inside may also include a list of lucky numbers (used by some as lottery numbers) and a Chinese phrase with translation. Fortune cookies in their current form were first served in California by immigrants who based the cookie on a traditional Japanese cracker.[citation needed] The cookies are little-known in mainland China or Taiwan.|`|sG5FKmAYaa	"Chow mein is related to and takes its name from "chao mian," a Chinese dish consisting of previously boiled noodles stirfried with meat and vegetables. There is, however, an important difference. In chow mein the noodles are deep fried in bundles, which are crisp and brittle when they emerge; whereas in the Chinese dish the noodles are soft."  ---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 183)  Edit  I can't find anything about cookies as the earliest would go back to early man
ULrOheW9aa	He probably isn't going to remember much from the time he was born, but he will remember Jr high and high school. When I drove limos I had xm satellite in my car. If I was driving a couple for their anniversary, I'd do the math and figure about when they met or at least were partying. I'd have the radio tuned in to the station of that era, it never left that station the whole night. So I would suggest a party themed in the 90's since he's only 4 yrs younger than I am.

So as long as it was super hot in your house you should be fine.|`|aa7932143314ae59c91eb730b8572e37aa	Typical know-nothing live-by-best-by-dates thinking.     It depends. It depends upon how fresh they are when you buy them and how hot the conditions in your kitchen.    They will actually last for WEEKS, yes, weeks if the environment is right, so anyone who says a day is a fool. Any bacteria in the eggs, eg salmonella,  will grow at a quicker rate than if refrigerated, but unless you are going to have them raw, they are likely to be killed by cooking.    Two of us tend to get through half a dozen eggs in a week, but will happily leave a dozen out over a couple of weeks or longer.     I haven't experienced a bad egg for some years, and that was so clearly off when I opened it, I just binned it.     Eggs do change with time and so the consistency of the white will change with time and old/young eggs can have specific applications.     But if you want to boil, fry or poach your eggs, you can leave them out on the side for as long as you like. Assuming you eat more than one a year.    I am amazed by some of the things people ask on this site sometimes.    Can I ask you one thing. Do you know where eggs come from?|`|7NJ8lKNEaa	one day only.

Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the tops of all of the vegetables you wish to blanch. Add a sprinkle of salt and bring the water to a boil over high heat.   Step 2.  While the water is coming to a boil, add a few handfuls of ice to a large bowl and fill it with cold water, creating an icy bath. Don't fill the bowl too much; you'll need to add your vegetables to the water shortly, and you don't want it to overflow.   Step 3.  Wash all of your vegetables thoroughly, and be sure to remove any produce stickers that may be on them.   Step 4.  With the pot at a rolling boil, carefully add the vegetables to the water one at a time. They only need to boil for about one minute, so watch them carefully. Remove the vegetables with a large slotted spoon after roughly a minute or so.  Step 5.  As you remove the vegetables, place them immediately into the bath of ice water. Once they all have been moved to the cold water, adjust and turn each one so that the entire surface area of the vegetables gets submerged for at least a few seconds.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	have ready one pot of boiling water and one bowl or pot of ice water.  drop the vegetables, in the hot water.  Once it starts to boil again, time for 2 minutes,  Take out of hot water and drop into ice water to "shock" it so the cooking process stops.  Do this in small batches so as not to cool the boiling water too much.  Return the water to a boil between batches of veg.  You can reuse the boiling water over and over but replenish the ice water to keep it very cold.  Add more ice or what ever.    Drain well and freeze.

vMXk9ohSaa	Enlist help.  Mom and dad or a couple of your BFF.      Have all the food and selection of drinks sitting out where everyone can help themselves.  If you plan to have more supply in the kitchen and warm up halfway into the party and bring out to the party room, you might think about hiring someone do do only that all night.  Even your little brother if you can trust him (he'd probably do whatever you want for $40 - $50).  Don't ask your friends to do chores - the party is to entertain you and them.  If your Mom and Dad are willing to take the backseat and work instead of sit around and chaperone, they could handle that part.      Have the music all set up on a CD player with at least 5-disk changer and put it on random so you won't have to mess with the music all night.  Focus your attention once the guests show up on them.  See each person as they come in and point them to the food and drinks.  Tell them where they can put their coat if they wore one. You might want to rent a coat rack with hangers for that. If they don't know anybody else, introduce them to someone asap so they don't feel lost.  Enlist your close friends to make sure everyone will keep busy and have fun.  That's not really work, and they probably would do it anyway.       If nobody is dancing, you need to start it up.  This is also a good idea to arrange who will ask you to dance when you give him "the look".|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Plan it so that you don't have to spend all your time filling glasses and putting things together in the kitchen.  Other than that, put it together, your food, drink and entertainment, based on what you know about the attendees.

NwYwLdsNaa	SHORT CRUST PASTRY:    1 1/4 c. flour  1/4 tsp. salt  3 tbsp. butter in sm. pieces  3 tbsp. butter  3 tbsp. cold water    Combine flour, salt and butter. Blend butter with pastry blender or fingertips until butter is the size of very small peas. Blend in butter. Stir in water with fork adding 2 tablespoons first. Add only enough water to form dough into a ball. Wrap in wax paper and chill for 20 minutes before using. Roll on lightly floured board.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Things Youll Need:  all-purpose flour   salt   water   shortening   large bowl   rolling pin and board     Step 1.  Ingredients should all be at room temperature.   Combine 2 cups of flour with 1 tsp salt.   Form a hollow in the middle and add 1 cup of Crisco (other shortenings just do not work as well).   Step 2.  Using clean hands work the shortening and flour together and slowly add 1/2 cup of water. Once the shortening and water are mixed into the flour, it should be able to form into a ball. Divide the ball in half.  Roll out on floured board or counter top. Don't overwork the crust or it will be hard and dry. It should fit a 9 inch pie tin. Crimp the edges   Step 3.  The other ball can be used as a top crust. If not, it can be a second pie for a cream filling. If you are using lemon or cream filling, bake the crust for 10 minutes at 425 degrees and then lower the temperature to 375 degrees for another 15 minutes. Since every oven is different, you will want to keep an eye on it the first time you bake it. You want this crust to be a golden brown.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	this is the best recipe i have ever used for pie pastry and it rocks!  from americas test kitchen    All-Butter Pie Pastry:  2 ? cups unbleached all-purpose flour (12 1/2 ounces), plus additional flour for work surface  1 tsp. salt  1 Tbs. sugar  1 cup unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes and frozen for 10 minutes  3 Tbs. sour cream  1/3 cup ice water, more if needed    For Pastry:     Process flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, about ten 1-second pulses.     Using fork, mix sour cream and 1/3 cup ice water in small bowl until combined. Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse for three 1-second pulses. Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture. Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry, and does not hold together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water and process until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, three to five 1-second pulses.    Turn dough out onto work surface. Divide dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk; wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not hard, 1 to 2 hours, before rolling. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let thoroughly chilled dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.)
AA10625089	It's the artificial sweetener.  I eventually got used to it and now diet soda just tastes more crisp and refreshing to me.|`|hKVh1EIcaa	the aspartame that is found in diet drinks can leave a bitter after taste.|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	The terrible after taste is from the aspartame (sugar substitute) it's a very icky, sweet after taste.       If you buy sugar free yogurt with aspartame in it, it tastes the exact same as diet soda. Haha....but don't do that because Aspartame is EXTREMELY bad for you.|`|A7foKkGKaa	because of the sugar subbstitute|`|31gN5L58aa	it doesn't!|`|7h0qfos1aa	Because they use aspertame instead of sugar - it's the aspertame you're tasting.|`|XzLUA7ataa	If you can't pronounce it, why put it into your body?  Have you read the chemical list of ingredients in diet soda?  The human digestive system was never meant to function on those ingredients.  You are actually better off with sugar than the artificial sweeteners.    If you must use an alternative sweetener, try Steevia, it is from a plant.|`|rfvRcOl9aa	fake sugar in it|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	It does?  That's all I drink, and I don't taste anything.  But some people are extra sensitive to some of the sugar subs, so that could be it.

AA10745041	Hush puppies simply "pop" when thrown into hot oil; there's no way around it to my knowledge. If you use tongs to drop them in gently and close to the oil's surface (thus lessening the "ker-plop"), that helps things somewhat.|`|AA12336927	how full are you filling the fry daddy? The hushpuppies have liquid ingredients, only add a few at a time|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I agree with the questions about how much oil you are using in your fry Daddy or any other pot.    I know that hush puppies are a dough type thing but make sure you are not getting any water or anything like it in the oil. It is really not good for the oil, can cause flare ups, and makes your oil break down faster.|`|vefI1iDiaa	Hot oil always splatters when you add food to it.  Lay some paper towels or newspaper down on the countertop to help with the mess.  Don't drop the food into the hot oil, lower it into the oil with a metal strainer.      Also, I'd invest in a candy thermomemter to make sure that your oil isn't too hot.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	are you using too much oil? when you fry anything, particulary anything cold the oil expands as soon as the food hits it.

NwYwLdsNaa	It's true if you want it to be!  :)    [edit] Research  Although it has received little scholarly attention, the five-second rule has been studied as both a public health recommendation and as a sociological effect.    In 2003, intern Jillian Clarke of the University of Illinois found in a survey that 56% of the men and 70% of the women surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule, and determined that a variety of foods were significantly contaminated by even brief exposure to a tile inoculated with E.coli;[1] on the other hand, Clarke also found no significant evidence of contamination on public flooring.[2] Clarke received the 2004 Ig Nobel Prize in public health (a parody award) for this work.[3]    A more thorough study in 2006 using salmonella on wood, tiles, and nylon carpet found that the bacteria were still thriving after twenty-eight days of exposure under dry conditions.[4] Tested after eight hours' exposure, the bacteria could still contaminate bread and bologna in under five seconds, but a minute-long contact increased contamination about tenfold (with tile and carpet surfaces only).[5]    The five-second rule was also featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel series MythBusters. There was no significant difference in the number of bacteria collected from 2 seconds exposure as there was from 6 seconds exposure. The moisture, surface geometry and the location the food item was dropped on did however affect the number of bacteria.|`|kppEhBBgaa	Nope, that is not true.  Bacteria exists everywhere, and if it touches something dirty it will contract it quickly.  I mean, if it fell in the toilet you wouldn't pick it up and eat it.  Basically same thing with the floor.|`|QcNkZxPaaa	No, any sort of contact will contract bacteria. The good thing is, that if you have a good immune system, that bacteria won't do anything.     So if it is a dry food, and it hits a dry surface, brush it up and eat it!     lol.    But if you're eating ice cream and it falls then no. If your eating crackers and it falls in a watery ground no!     dry to dry is my philosophy|`|b7Ib3ZWQaa	no, because if you drop food in poo for 2 seconds there will be poo on the food. And poo has bacteria in it.(idk why you would drop food in poo, but yeah)|`|dstvm3zRaa	no they proved it wrong on mythbusters|`|TPpTAKAdaa	No, it is just a myth.  I saw something on Myth Busters about it.  So, though some bacteria that food picks up on the ground might be harmless no matter how long its been there, it's better to be safe than sorry.  I don't eat anything that dropped even if its been on the ground for a second.|`|AA11394457	Nah, it's just an excuse that chefs invented so food wouldn't be wasted.    Here's some more info:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-second...|`|9EOmfd8maa	I don't believe that it is really true since bacteria is everywhere good and bad however I think that if something hits the ground for only 5 seconds it's probably not enough bad bacteria to hurt ya!!! After all I'm still here.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	probably not but I personally don't worry about it. If it hit the dry floor and there isn't any visible dirt, I brush it off and eat it.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	All food will pickup bacteria from the floor.    Moist food will pickup bacteria much faster and easier than dry food.  It also depends on how dirty the floor is that you dropped the food onto.  I might eat a glob of peanut butter that fell onto my kitchen counter, but I wouldn't eat anything that had been dropped on the floor of a bathroom...    Both Food Detectives and Mythbusters have episodes where they research this.  Their findings are, it's possible for any food to pick up bacteria from being dropped on the floor.  It's also possible for that bacteria to be something noxious, like salmonella or e-coli.  Whether or not it's a dangerous amount depends on how dirty the floor is, and how strong your immune system is.
AA12336927	mix up a slurry of corn starch and water or broth. I usually ( no I'm not a chef) use a tablespoon of corn starch and about a quarter cup of liquid, whisk with a fork and add the the soup, stirring till thick. Just add a little at a time, while stirring till its the consistency you want|`|hKlsJgVSaa	You should have coated the meat with flour, then browned it and then added to everything else.    Other will suggest make a flour or cornstarch slurry, or adding potatoe flakes etc... If you just add a flour slurry it will taste floury, make a roux of equal parts butter and flour and then add that to the stew, stir and simmer some more.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Add a couple of cups of finely grated carrot.  This adds a natural sweetener and is a slight thickener too.  You can also take out about 1/2 c. of the hot liquid; and whisk about 1 TB flour or cornstarch in there until it's smooth;  then whisk that back into the big pot of soup.  This will keep it smooth and you won't have lumps.  You may need to adjust the herbs for the flour you added though.  You could also add more veggies to it; and the pieces for stew are normally larger than those for soup|`|a01e4b2cbf639961f2d6add54036adefaa	Some uncooked barley or rice. Either the instant rice or regular.  Cook it until what ever you add is done through,  this will thicken the soup and add some fiber and great taste to it.
j4uTq48Eaa	Yes, but the fish will become slacked out. Meaning it will not be the same and it won't taste the same.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It's not recommended.  Fish is delicate, and you'll lose alot of the flavor that way.  In fact, fish should be eaten fresh whenever possible|`|vefI1iDiaa	Nope.  But if you aren't planning on eating it soon, you can cook it, cool it, and refreeze it.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	It is recommended not to refreeze meat of any kind actually.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	no|`|ssDUxbWfaa	NASTY!

All tested on animals before they were tried on humans.. so far the great RoboEeyore can only point to one...     No matter how many doctors sign a position paper against animal testing, I guarantee you 100% of them wil prescribe or perform a procedure that was tested on animals if that will cure or save their patent's life.

We don't have the technology to test drugs without using animals yet. Hopefully soon we will. I'm a vegetarian in medical school, I've dissected many animals and animal parts. It's sad, but without doing this I wouldn't be prepared to operate on people.|`|Am7J9MVBaa	I hate animal testing. Humans rely on animals to test there drugs, there is nothing noble about what the animals are put through, it's terrible, horrible torture. Animals are often left crippled and dying, and have to be killed.    Some people rely on certain drugs to live. Everyone makes there own individual choice about what they will use and won't use based on there own opinions.|`|UM8EFzIMaa	I have no problem with animal testing for medicines and medical procedures. Everything else I'm against.    From what I understand, they do have non-animal based insulin now.|`|3R2eHvpUaa	i totally agree against the animal testing, but what other alternatives are there? scientists should maybe look into alternatives to the rats, etc....if there are any|`|AA12336056	I'm fine with animal testing when it comes to medicine. I believe that it is a necessary evil that can save millions of human and animal lives in the future. My issue is with cosmetics testing. There is absolutely no reason to subject living creatures to that kind of testing just so we can have a new shade of lipstick. There are plenty of alternatives for cosmetics testings because that kind of research does not require autopsies, etc of the animals post-treatment like medical research does.|`|9wGz6ySNaa	they should test drugs on convicted felins, not animals|`|AA11173395	I am against animal testing, and PETA does not live here.  Thank you for calling.  Have a nice day.|`|6bc1f629a527af3db8edd2c03bf1bc9caa	There are actually laws that require animals to be tested on... Sad, I know. Anyways, PETA has a strong stance on testing for the case of cosmetics and such because there are no laws, there are alternatives, and it's cruel. However, they do encourage companies that make medicines to retire animal testing and use alternatives... Until laws are changed, it's still going to happen and people, even people that try to be vegan will use the medicines. In todays world it's really hard to be totally vegan because everything from cars to medicines somehow affects animals :( We just have to do the best we can.|`|5X8SvT38aa	Honey, stay away from that PETA. They are a bunch of fanatics. Animal testing has saved countless lives.|`|FicyC2TXaa	Ingrid Newkirk relies on a potentially life-saving drug; plant-based it may be, but it has still been tested on animals as required by law.     Yet Newkirk and PETA as a whole seek to deny the rest of us access to such life-saving drugs. One rule for them...    You have a more realistic view on this issue than those who simply oppose all animal testing because of your need to rely on drugs. People who shout the loudest about their opposition to animal-tested medication are, without exception, fortunate enough (so far) not to be in that position.    Like you I rely on potentially life-saving drugs which have, by law, been tested on animals. In my case the drugs are to - it is hoped - prevent a recurrence of cancer.    I am very much against animal testing for products such as cosmetic and cleaning materials, and I am against animal experimentation for its own sake.    But I owe my life to animal-tested drugs, and I am not convinced that there are more reliable ways to test drugs. I wish there were, but I'm not convinced, and it is too simplistic to argue that animals are not physically the same as us or that some drugs that have been found safe in animals have proved unsafe for humans. Most medical advances would not have taken place without animal testing.    Sometimes we have to consider the lesser of two evils.    I'm vegan in order to minimise my personal contribution to animal suffering and exploitation as much as I can, but I value human life way, way over animal life. Including my own - I recently read of a drug that may reduce or prevent metastasis of the cancer I had, and am now in remission from. It was described as at 'the mouse stage'. If it ever proves effective and I'm still around, I certainly won't be boycotting it - anyone else who wants first place in the line will have to fight me for it.    Anyone who is arrogant, stupid or inexperienced enough to criticise your decision to take essential medication is not worth listening to. And that incluse PETA and the the sickening hypocrisy of Newkirk.|`|GY4yYB6jaa	The issue with the animla testing is not at PeTA or anyone else wants no medicines or drugs to exist- but that there are far better, more effective methods of scientific research that does not involve animal experimentation.    Animal rights groups fight to get this methodologies into wider use, but unfortunately because the animal testing structure is so cheap to work with and lines the pockets of those involved, they are up against it.    A huge majority of the scientific community does agree however that animal experimentation is a dated practice that leads to medical mistakes and ineffective outcomes. It is widely reported that animal experimentation has actually hindered scientific developments dramatically where other methods could have produced far more accurate reults, and in much quicker time. The benefits of Penicillin is just one example that would have been discovered decades earlier had animal research not shown it to kill small mammals.    But the pharmaceutical industry is all about the big bucks, and that is hard to compete with and challenge.    The undeniable irony with animal research is that scientists justify that it is morally acceptable because 'they are not like us' - yet the fundamental basis for the effectiveness of animla research lies on the assumption that the animals ARE like us..... it is a total contradiction.    With regards to the insulin, there are non-animal insulin forms.|`|7E2kGw2naa	Whether or not there are alternatives to animal testing available is not relevant.  If people were testing medicines on orphans, would I have an obligation to find them an alternative for their tests? Nope, because testing medicines on orphans is unethical to begin with.    Whether or not animal testing saves lives is also irrelevant (unless you are a utilitarian, which I am not). The means do not justify the ends.  If they did doctors would start killing people so that they could give healthy organs to people who need them.  More people would be saved than would be killed, same idea.    I know this will be hard for some people, who don't have a firm grasp on ethics, to understand.

zawmsUO1aa	Camping Ice Cream        1 Pound Coffee Can  ? Cup Whole Milk  1 Cup Whipping Cream  1/3 cup sugar  ? tsp vanilla  A 3-Pound Coffee Can  Crushed Ice  ? Cup Rock salt  Fruit, if desired  Roll of duct tape  (campers friend)    Combine milk, whipping cream, sugar, vanilla and, if desired, fruit into the 1-Pound coffee can.  Use duct tape to securely fasten the cover on the can. Place inside the 3-Pound coffee can. Surround the smaller can with ice and rock salt. Seal the larger coffee can tightly with duct tape. Kick the can or roll back and forth underfoot for 10 minutes. Un-seal and open both cans, being sure to wipe off the small can before opening, so that the salt does not get into the mixture. Stir the ice cream mixture. Re-seal the small can. Place it back into the big can; add more crushed ice. Re-seal the larger can. Kick it again for 5 more minutes.     Options: Strawberry: canned strawberry pie filling (approx 3 to 4 Tbsp or less to suit your taste.  Vanilla: Another 1.2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Chocolate: add chocolate syrup (approx 3 to 4 tbsp more or less)  Or ? cup of any chopped fresh fruit.|`|k4NAnEYpaa	Makes one serving:    1/2 cup milk(any type)  1 tablespoon of sugar  1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract or chocolate syrup  lots of ice  rock salt  can be purchased in nearly any grocery store    1.  Mix sugar, milk or half & half, and flavoring in a bowl, then seal it in a quart-sized plastic bag.    2.Take roughly two quarts of ice (crushed if possible) and place it into the gallon-sized bag with rock salt. Ideally, the gallon bag will be roughly half full with the ice and salt mixture.    3. Place the sealed quart-sized bag with the ingredients into the gallon-sized bag. Make sure the bags stay sealed! Do not allow the contents to mix at any time. If the bags don't seal sufficiently, use duct tape to seal the top of both bags to ensure they don't open during shaking.    4. Gently agitate, massage, and shake the bags for about ten to fifteen minutes. In this amount of time the contents of the quart (smaller) bag should start to turn into solid ice cream. As you agitate the two bags, it is important that you are mixing the contents of the inner bag, but you dont want to be so aggressive that you burst the inner bag or cut it on the ice (double-bagging should prevent this).    If your hands get uncomfortably cold, use a towel or an old t-shirt to hold the bags as you massage them; they will be quite cold and might become slippery with accumulated condensation. Consider using gloves or massaging while holding onto the top seal if a towel or similar cloth is not available.    5. Remove the small bag from the large bag. Scoop the ice cream from it and enjoy!
NNiN0tK0aa	Eat all the meals you eat now (if they're healthy) but replace the meat with lentils or beans or soya-meat or other fake meat or nuts/seeds plus vegetables.

Sausages and Colcannon - a traditional celtic dish made from kale and mash potato - it sounds awful but is unbelievably delicious.      Shred greens and mix them in with mash.  Puree orange veg and add to gravy/sauces/soups/stews.  So you don't notice them.  Drink vegetable juice.  Eat a salad (containing all kinds of raw veg, not just lettuce, cucumber and other "salad vegetables" - grate them, slice them, chop them.) with every meal.  I find raw veg goes down much better if eaten in the same mouthfool as cooked food such as mash or bolognaise.    Also - to reduce your carbs and increase your veg, try using squash instead of pasta.  You can use spaghetti squash as spaghetti or buy a saladacco/spirooli which is a gadget which makes vegetables into thin spaghetti strands.  You can use butternut squash or zucchini.  You can cook them if you want.    You can make lasagna using slices of squash instead of sheets of pasta.  Include pumpkin seeds and some kind of bean/lentil in your layers so you're getting enough protein.  You can mash butternut squash and use instead of mash potato or baked potato or roast potato.    There are many varieties of squash, if you don't like one, try another.  Make your own bread and include pumpkin in your recipe.  Have sweet potatoes sometimes instead of white.  (counts as veg rather than carb)|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	Tofu is always a good choice. You can buy it marinated here in New Zealand and in Australia and its actually quite yummy. You can add it to a salad or a stir fry. There's also a wide range of soy "meat" substitutes available out there which you can serve with potatoes, or cooked vegies or salad.

Turkey and cheese hoagie (big enough that he can eat half at one time and the other later or all at once fillin up), toss on what he enjoys (tomato, pickle lettuce etc etc). A trick to keeping them fresh is to put the meat and cheese on the bread parts and spread mayo or mustard/anything moist in between them. The bread will stay fresh. Apple, nuts or trailmix (tasty and high in fat/protein), raisins, grapes, chips, a frozen water bottle (it'll keep food cold and thaw out later by lunchtime and be cold).    You could also go for pizza slices. They don't need to be refrigerated and are great the day after. Granola bars/protein bars/fruit bars great and healthy snack.

AA11865682	Yes it is. The whiskey has stopped aging because it is no longer in oak but if it has been unopened, it will be fine to drink. Once it is opened it won't necessarily go off, but after some years you may notice a colour change and a slightly bitter aftertaste. That's called oxidisation and it won't render the whiskey undrinkable (it won't make you sick) but the flavour may be a little lacking.|`|bitffZ6kaa	It will keep forever but be careful of evaporation.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	Your whiskey is drinkable, but why would you want to drink it?

7HKTDcvYaa	Your breakfast is too high on the glycemic index so it will make you hungry before a lunch time, unless of course you get up rather late.    Same statement for lunch and snack.    You would be better advised to move your dinner to breakfast time. It is a much better choice to fuel your daily activities.    You appear to be running on empty all day, not enough energy to think well or support a reasonable level of activity.    Now, because you do not tell us how much of that hot pot you are eating. but in total your diet is probably too low in calories.    A good addition would be an addition to breakfast of a bowl of freshly ground brown flax seed, with milk. (1/5 of a cup before grinding) The flax seed will provide a slow release energy to keep you supplied between meals  An additional snack might be walnuts. Walnuts are one of the few whole foods identified by US FDA as proving that they extend life. But they also keep your body energized.    You do need energy to think on.

xrRZeROmaa	It depends on your time frame.  The State of California says you are drunk on two beers if you weigh that much, and drink them within one hour.  Whether you can maintain in a drunk state is something learned over time.  Three to four beers within one hour for someone weighing 130 pounds will definitely produce a state of euphoria, if not a state of stupor.  So I would state un-categorically, that a person weighing 130 pounds who drinks 6 beers within an hour, and is still standing, is not a light weight.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	If you drink to get drunk, you are a LOSER!!!!

What am I thinking?|`|ILYEAa9laa	yes, but look on the brightside you dont have to spend much money to get drunk!|`|Hg3E5IIOaa	Depends on the beer.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Depends on how drunk you get, and how long it took you to drink 6 beers.    I'm 175 and over a 2 hour period I had 4 beers the other night.  I know that I was not good to drive, but I wouldn't say I was drunk either (legally drunk, sure).  To get drunk, I imagine it would have taken perhaps another 3 or 4.  But this would be a safe drunk, the kind where you have a hangover but it goes away by lunchtime.    If you were passed out drunk after 6, then yes, that's a lightweight.  As long as we're talking standard 12oz 5%ABV beers and not the much nicer 22oz 8.5% beers :)

xrRZeROmaa	No, you can just buy your pizza already baked., or bake it on bricks in your BBQ.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVeQBHlud...|`|AA10097817	I love my stone, but I rarely use it for pizza.|`|zawmsUO1aa	I use my stone for baking bread - it makes a nice hard crust.|`|69bp1IMfaa	Yes|`|4aMjGpqRaa	no its not completly necesary its just that the crust wont be as good the stone is left in the oven to get very very very hot and holds the heat well beter then meta so it just makes a crispier crust but you can deffinatly cook a pizza with out a baking stone the crust will just suffer a little i would plan on getting one if you can its deffinatley worth it|`|AA11490722	i don't own a stone and i make pizza at home all the time on just a regular oven tray- the pizza still turns out delicious anyway. So no a stone is not necessary.    However if you use a stone it does make the pizza base nice a crispy and it generally cooks a bit quicker too|`|wPM6eBkWaa	Makes a big difference on how crunchy the bottom gets.  The stone is similar to a brick oven stone, so I recommend using them.  They are great.   You can use them for other things as well, like making cookies.  The neat thing about them is they don't absorb flavors.  I can make roasted potatoes with garlic one day and the next bake cookies on that type of stoneware with no adverse taste to the product I am baking.|`|2RWayH3Oaa	It depends on how you like the bottom of the pizza.  I never had any luck with pizza stones because they break.  I have heard of people buying large floor tiles at the home improvement store and using that for bread and pizza though I have never tried it.  Just make sure your oven is very hot to ensure the dough is cooked or try grilling your pizza, thats my fav way to cook them.   Ever notice the temp on the commercial ovens at your local pizza place. They crank that baby up to around 450 to 475 degrees.

AeW4Uz1Taa	Not so unheard of, in some cultures it's common practice. But next time try cocoa powder from a good brand. In South America they use cocoa to even out the balance in chili's(as in the pepper's). They also believe the cinnamon with cocoa is a wonderful flavor. I use a teaspoon of cinnamon mixed in with my recipe of chocolate chip cookie dough. And in my hot chocolate. I also have put cocoa in my chili to balance out all the acidity from the tomatoes and chili's.  So like i said, not so unheard of.  Try it, if it's good for you then you have a winner.

rsTB7D1zaa	Talk to your family about it.  They probably know of your problem anyways, but even if they don't they'd be happy to know you want to stop drinking more than they would be upset you drink.    AA is a support group.  Your family would probably do a better job of supporting you.  Instead of drinking, spend time with them, talk about why you want to drink, explain why you want to stop.  Just understanding why you have been drinking this way and realizing what damage it causes should be enough to help you.    BTW, its very common to try to stop drinking and fail.  If you fail, just try again.  Quitting quitting is not an option.|`|8cgfTAOeaa	AA is not about all about God. When they say "higher power" it means having something to believe in other than alcohol. It is really laid back where I went. You could always try once and not go back if it's uncomfortable.

You might just have a situational drinking problem which can be arrested in various ways.    However if you would like, i would encourage you to go to some meetings and check it out.  It can't hurt.  Also, here is a great site which you can listen to tapes if you don't want to go to a meeting.    AA is not a support group, as stated earlier.  Although people recive support through the group and people in it, AA is a program of recovery.  It was important for me to talk to people that understood what I was feeling and thinking.  My family was very supportive but they couldn't relate as well as the people in AA.

Three-Bean Salad  The All American Bean Book Ted Waskey    1 cup green beans, cut into 1 pieces and blanched, still warm  2 cups great northern beans, cooked drained and still warm  2 cups Idaho red or kidney beans, cooked drained and still warm  ? cup olive oil  ? cup red wine vinegar  2 cloves garlic, finely minced  ? tsp. oregano  Salt and pepper to taste  1 large Spanish onion, sliced thin  ? cup celery sliced thin    You can substitute garbanzo beans for the green beans if you like.  Combine beans in a large bowl. In another bowl combine remaining ingredients but sliced onions and mix well with a wire wisk or pulse in a blender or food processor. Add to bean mixture with onions and toss to mix well. Cover and refrigerate overnight for best flavors and results.    Whistleberry Pie  Neal Humphry    1/2 cup Anasazi beans, cooked until tender (about 3-4 hours with this variety, no pre-soaking necessary).  4 egg yolks  1 cup brown sugar  1 tablespoon pumpkin pie seasoning  1 tablespoon Mexican vanilla  1 cup corn syrup  1 pie crust    For a 10" DO, prepped with baker's parchment under a pie crust so you can lift the result out.    I've had to use a blender to get a full puree.  I start with all ingredients and then add the beans after I've mashed them up a bit so I don't burn my blender up.    Whip four egg whites until stiff and then fold in the whistleberry puree.  When mixed, pour it into your pie crust.  Leave about 1/2 inch space up to the rim of your crust because it will expand.  You might have enough mix for two pies, I'm still working out some of the details.    Bake with six-seven bottom briquettes in a circle next to the edge of the pot, 13-15 briquettes around the rim on top.  Takes about 30-40 minutes.    Serve with whipping cream topping.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer; cover and simmer 30 minutes.   Serves 6 to 10    Traditional Rice Stuffed Grape Leaves    1 16 oz. jar grape leaves  6 Tbs. olive oil  1 medium onion, finely chopped  ? cup green onions, chopped  1 cup long grain rice, uncooked  2 cloves garlic, minced  1 tsp. cumin  6 Tbs. fresh fennel, chopped  ? cup fresh dill, minced  ? cup fresh flat leaf parsley, minced  1 ? tsp. dried mint  Salt and pepper to taste  4 to 5 cups water  Juice from 2 lemons, strained    Gently wash grape leaves under cold running water to remove the brine. Bring enough water to a boil to cover the grape leaves and add leaves to  hot water. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Remove to a colander and rinse with cold water, then drain in colander very well.  In a large cast iron skillet, heat 2 Tbs. olive oil over medium high heat. Saute onions and green onions until translucent. Add rice and continue to saut until rice is a light brown color, stirring frequently, about 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, and 2 cups hot water. Cover and simmer until rice is cooked through but firm and water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Mix in fennel, dill, parsley, and mint. Add 2 Tbs. olive oil or 1 raw egg to keep rice moist during further cooking.   Prepare the Dutch oven by putting 2 Tbs. olive oil and 3 Tbs. water in the bottom of the pot. Sort out damaged or torn grape leaves and place in the bottom of the Dutch oven to completely cover the bottom. Remove any stiff or hard stems from leaves before using.  To stuff the grape leaves, place 1 tsp. of the stuffing in the center of one grape leaf. Fold the bottom(stem end) of the leaf up over the stuffing. Next, fold the left then right sides over each side of the stuffing to form a sort of envelope. Roll the grape leaf and stuffing up to the top of the leaf to close. Place each stuffed grape leaf in the Dutch oven, seam side down and repeat until all the grape leaves or filling is used up. Sprinkle lemon juice over the top of the stuffed grape leaves and add about 2 cups of water. Place a glass plate over the top of the grape leaves to keep them from floating and opening up. Cover and bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer over medium low heat for about 2 hours, until rice is cooked through and leaves are tender. Serve warm or cold and with a bchamel sauce.

I hope you enjoy it as much as we have.      ? 2 pounds ground beef  ? 1/2 pound fresh ground pork  ? 1 cup dry bread crumbs  ? 2 teaspoons salt  ? 1/2 teaspoon pepper  ? 1 large egg  ? 3 tablespoons butter  ? 1/2 cup hot water    Place a medium sized baking pan into a cool oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.    Place the hot water into a large mixing bowl and add the butter.  Stir until completely melted.  Add all remaining ingredients and mix well.    Shape mixture into a loaf and place in heated baking pan.  Cook your meatloaf for approximately 40 minutes or until an internal temperature of 170 degrees has been reached.    Don't overcook or the meatloaf will be dry.  You may serve this southern meatloaf either hot or cold.  My kids like to use ketchup when eating this, but I prefer sauteed onions on the top of mine.    This recipe also freezes well, so it can be a good idea to double the recipe and make 2 loaves of meatloaf at once.  It will take a bit longer to cook 2 meatloaves, but use an internal meat thermometer to test for doneness.  Cool 2nd meatloaf completely before covering in freezer wrap and storing in your freezer for another night.  Thaw in your refrigerator and reheat in 350 degree oven.  Cover the meatloaf with aluminum foil while reheating to make sure the meatloaf doesn't dry out.|`|VrzX3mWsaa	Method 1  Meat Loaf    Ingredients        * 2 slices fresh white bread , crusts removed      * 500g pack minced beef/pork      * 1 onion , roughly chopped      * 1 garlic clove , roughly chopped      * big handful of parsley      * 1 tbsp fresh chopped oregano or 1 tsp dried      * 4 tbsp freshly grated parmesan      * 1 egg , beaten      * 8 slices prosciutto      Method       1.

oBzRrsVlaa	They claim that drinking it will give you five hours of energy.|`|84rmH2Wraa	well in my case it should be 3 day energy. i took some and couldn't sleep 4 3 days. boy was my house clean!|`|KsN5DnGtaa	Well it probably just gives you energy for 5 hours....whats not to get?|`|AA11104652	I know....I sympathize with you. I drank it and was only energized for 4 hours and 59 minutes. I think they should to that for a product name. They, seriously, probably named it that because during product testing and R&D the consumers probably all turned results that varied from "This didn't do **** for me" -to- "Wow, I used to be a cocaine addict and this is just like it! I never want to sleep again!" All in all, the test results probably showed that 5 hours was average amount of time the comsumer "felt" energized. You, on one hand didn't feel it...

The recipe is just different.|`|S1VG6tocaa	mt. dew owns|`|R0kPeJqVaa	well its more of a "whats the deal with coke". just think about it in a different way. if you think about water and juice and more natural beverages. then think about opening a can of coke and fizzy stuff comes out, its kinda weird isnt it? water doesnt fizz up or react in such weird ways.    and btw the answer to your question is mt.dew is obviously less carbonated|`|HgrzVACfaa	hi

When it boils, add the macaroni (cook 7-10 min). Taste it to see if how hard it is. You don't want it soggy.    Drain it. Make sure all the water drains. Add milk, cheese and butter as per box.    It's very simple.....|`|yhkEyVXLaa	Sorry kiddo, but there really is no full proof method.  You really do have to read the directions and if you are using a microwave make sure it's not on the wrong temperature.  If you are using the stove/pan, make sure you pour the water out.  Hope this helps.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	It sounds to me like you didn't drain your macaroni!!!!    Pour it OUT of that pan that you boiled it in and into a colander.....one of those bowls with holes in it...if you don't have one of those, use some kind of strainer, even if you have to do it only a little at a time.    All those macaroni's have a hole inside them and you would be amazed at how much water they hold!    Good luck to you!  You should be proud of yourself being able to cook.  I bet you can make scrambled eggs and toast, too.  Eat Healthy.  Be smart.

8gpvkxcvaa	Do you have a coffee pot you can use?  I like to use 2-3 family sized tea bags and place them in the filter basket.  I then 'brew' @10 cups of water thru the coffee pot.  I prepare my 2 quart pitcher with ice up to about 1/2 way and either 1 cup of sugar or the equivalent in Splenda or other artificial sweetener.  When your tea has brewed, simply pour over your ice and sweetener and fill with any cold water needed to fill to 2 quart line on pitcher.  Stir and serve.  Delicious.    *You can also use regular tea bags, just follow suggestions on tea box of suggested tea bag amounts for 2 quart serving.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I usually boil 1 quart of water with 4 to 6 regular tea bags.

16i8jJ2daa	It depends what cut of meat the cubes are. If you bought them already cubed, they are probably a tougher cut like chuck. If that's the case you'll need to cook them long and slow. I would season them, lightly flour and brown in a little oil. Cover with beef broth, and maybe some sliced onion, garlic and your green peppers. Reduce your heat and simmer for about an hour.The broth should thicken some by then. I would add the corn toward the end with some chunks of potatoes and carrots -cook until the veggies are tender. Guess you'd call it a beef stew.|`|CnBMe52naa	Beef Stew     1 pound cubed beef stew meat   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour   3 tablespoons shortening   1 teaspoon salt   1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper   4 cups water   1 onion, finely diced   1/4 teaspoon paprika   1 clove garlic, minced   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce   1 bay leaf   3 carrots, quartered   3 potatoes, peeled and quartered   1/4 cup all-purpose flour   1/2 cup frozen corn kernels     Dredge beef in flour and then, in a medium stock pot, brown beef on all sides in shortening. Add salt, pepper, water, onion, paprika, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and bay leave. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 2 hours or until meat is tender.   Add carrots and potatoes and simmer for 45 minutes or until tender.   Remove bay leave and meat from stew, add 1 tablespoon flour or cornstarch and mix, in order to thicken stew. After mixing let sit for a few minutes to thicken, if not to desired thickness add more flour or cornstarch and repeat.   Once thickened return meat and add corn to stew, heat through and serve.|`|gHUalk8Xaa	You can make a stir fry and serve it over a bed of rice

hQcBpj7Oaa	Port is a dessert wine and balsamic vinegar is already very sweet.  When you reduce them down, you will essentially be allowing the sugar to caramelize and condense.

Good luck!|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	that sounds so good. :)|`|TPVvddHWaa	It is a very rich strong flavour and will smother the delicate taste of the scallop.

nicPhhvtaa	A fifth of any spirit equates to about three cups. If you purchase three of the smaller boxes of Jell-o (the ones that yield 4 1/2 cup servings) and prepare the gelatin utilizing the directions on the back of the box and simply replace the cold water with chilled liquor you will be able to fill about 48 one ounce shots with a fifth of liquor. That's 16 Jell-o shots for each box of jell-o.    As for as enjoying the shots themselves, I suggest you buy plastic shot glasses. Using glass shot glasses can be a real hassle to clean as gelatin can be a nuisance. I have been told that you can coat the insides of the shot glasses with Pam or some sort of vegetable oil but I really don't trust that. I always just supplied toothpicks with the shots which works just fine with a little suckle.    Vodka is a great choice for Jell-O shots because it yields a neutral flavor but if you want to be creative you could also use tequila with the lime flavor to make a margarita shot or maybe a light rum with a strawberry flavor to make a daiquri, gin with a lemon flavor to make a tom collins, sky's the limit. It's all about what liquor you enjoy the most. I would suggest staying away from dark rums or whiskey as they are rather full-flavored spirits and can be too rich. Either way Jell-o shots really are a great addition to any party.|`|nrNrLuawaa	not sure what your measurement was supposed to be but just substitute the cup of cold water with vodka and you are good|`|2C6btidDaa	you need the EZ-SQUEEZE JELLO SHOT CUPS!!! they are made for jello shots    go check out http://www.ez-squeeze.com for the recipes for jello shots...they have best the recipes you can think of and they tell you what liquors to use...    order the cups to, they work great for jello shots! you just squeeze all the jello out and they cups dont crack so they are re-usable!|`|pGPcFeqoaa	5

Most varieties have a cheese base and come in small chunks or balls. Cheese baits are usually cast across a pool and the bait allowed to drift with the current. Other popular baits include whole kernel corn, marshmallows, and cereal types.

qexKY00naa	Cooking bacon is better for you in the microwave because you can wrap it in paper towels to soak up the grease!  This also makes it extra crispy|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	I think if you cook it in an oven the point would be to cook it at an elevated height, that way the fat drips off. Try placing a metal cookie cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet (lined w/ foil). When you cook the bacon the grease should drip onto the cookie sheet.     Otherwise I think the oven vs. pan are the same thing.     As for cooking bacon in the microwave, that's should be for desperate measures only! =)|`|ox85tnblaa	Maybe because if you do it in the microwave- there are usually paper towels involved that will absorb the fat as its being melted off the bacon. Top of stove-it will have to sit in it's own grease throughout cooking. Personally I don't like either method. It gets touh and chewy in the microwave and again-greasy stove top. The way I like to do it is in a broiler pan in the oven so the grease can fall away as it cooks. Produces a much better result than othe methods.

Your coating may have been too think though.     Use 1/2c corn syrup, 3/4c water, and 2c sugar. Cook this together.

JTu1cLkYaa	I used to cook game hen in the microwave all the time. Took 25 minutes from freezer to table. You don't get the browning with the microwave that you do with regular cooking, but it does cook.     Microwave Cooking Times (approximate)       Microwave without turntable: Turn micro dish 1/4 turn halfway through cooking time to redistribute cooking action.    Microwave with turntable: turn chicken pieces 1/4 turn or mix casserole halfway through cooking time.      1-2 pieces 4-6 min. full power      3-4 pieces 7-10 min. full power      7-8 pieces 15-18 min. full power      quarter chicken 12-15 min. 50% power      half chicken 15-18 min. 50% power      whole chicken 35-40 min. 50% power      For best results in the microwave- remove skin from the chicken before placing in the microwave as the cooking is so quick the skin will not have time to crisp.    For even cooking, arrange chicken parts on a microwave rack or trivet spoke fashion, with the thickest parts to the outside and the thinner parts towards the centre.     Never cover chicken with plastic wrap in the microwave - it will hold in too much moisture causing the chicken to stew and become stringy.     Loosely cover with waxed or parchment paper while cooking to minimize splattering and help maintain an even heat distribution. Don't tuck the paper in, just lay it over the trivet.|`|UMRk2PoDaa	Nooooooo! Don't do that, it's not meant for the microwave at all BAKE (oven), FRY (deep fryer or pan) NOT the microwave.

Approx 60% fruit, 40% green.    drink water with a squeeze of lemon in it.  drink herbal teas especially nettle or dandelion to help your liver.    for lunch have a home made soup - just vegetables and beans/lentils and herbs or spices to flavour it.  then a dark green salad with greens from above.  you can blend orange juice with sesame seeds to make a dressing.  add chopped mushrooms/beansprouts/pumpkin seeds/grated veg to it if you want.  some fresh fruit or berries for dessert    for dinner have something made from lentils and vegetables.  lentil bolognaise/chillie/curry/stew with sweet potato or wholegrain brown rice.      at night have another green smoothie.    after a week of that you would feel amazing!!!!    other things that would help detox but you don't have to do =  skin brushing before a shower  cold showers  cold/hot/cold/hot showers  steaming hot baths with epsom salts in  massage|`|Am7J9MVBaa	Noooo! Don't starve yourself! Lol =]    Firsty, smile. Seriously. Like a ton. It burns calories. Okay...    Try to stick to eating at certain times. Have three main meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Snacks should be healthy and limit it to one snack between each meal.     Drink water before each meal, people often confuse hunger with thirst.    Stop weighing yourself! It seriously just makes you more worried. Not good!    Exercise is suuper important! I know your probably busy, so try maybe just doing some curl ups before bed? ANYTHING helps.     People often eat when they're sad/depressed/scared/lonely. So, when you get one of these feelings, do something fun! Listen to music, go running, take a bath... anything you enjoy!    Good luck, and SMILE. Seriously. =P|`|sLEoWYr5aa	Eat an Activia yogurt, works wonders.|`|ttxWNKSKaa	Jazz hands all day and nimble on cardboard.  Feel free to season the cardboard.|`|5ZkGgZWSaa	Detox my @rse. trust me the way to stop been so bloated is to cut down on the amount of wheat you consume. Also make sure that you are getting enough protein & vitamins in your diet along with fresh fruit/vegetables & fish (even frozen berries & frozen veg is okay.)  Walk places when you can ,take the stairs instead of the lift, spend 10 minutes each day doing a small amount of exersize.  it is a fine line between putting on weight & losing it so don't go over the top on a 'DIET'.|`|UB7pWWHeaa	No.... eat high fiber veggies as your meal and have a piece of fruit for breakfast... too bad you are vegan or else I would recommend yogurt. If you feel bloated just stay away from bread and grain and stick to the veggies for a day or so.... have a salad... some good foods may make you feel bloated while actually doing wonders for your body... so don't stress it, and don't starve either. that's not a good idea. remember fiber. broccoli etc. it will make you poop and hopefully relieve yourself (why do i feel embaressed saying that? haha)|`|qf4NEOYmaa	dont eat soooo much|`|DMhAPurkaa	great answers here,   even the funny one about nibbling on cardboard, and feel free to season the cardboard! R O F  Cruciferous vegetables cause gas and bloating  cauliflower and broccolli  they will give your baby gas and tummy aches if you ever breastfeed after eating those.   Popcorn and beans can do this too.   Also eating what foods are not indicated for your certain body type will be indigestable and cause this bloating and intestinal troubles.  I recommend checking out what your body type is , if you havent already. it sounds like your blood is weak and you are just really hungry because your body is lacking in some mineral or electrolyte or vitamin.  Check out ayurveda+body types in yahoo search.  Little quiz...   quick fix now though is a teaspoon of baking soda in a half glass of water.  This makes some vomit which may be good  but it s not too pleasant.  fennel  dill chamomile, sage, coriander, parsley. caraway, cayenne, anise, jasmine(jasmine rice or tea, black pepper... are all good for tummy troubles and intestinal maladies.   You can cook with these items and then you will have less discomfort.  But if what you choose to eat to begin with does not agree with you in the first place,  maybe change that first.  Check out the survey. Below is a site that explains all the herbs and their use. Really user friendly and visually pleasant.  Be kind to yourself as well as caring for the earth and the animals,   be well|`|PBMZKeXoaa	exercise exercise exerice and drink water
Vt7Fqk0Waa	go out and buy a couple of cases of beer (no twist offs) and drink up! or invite some friends over and ask them to bring any empty bottles that are not a twist off. You keep the bottles clean and sanitize them and your caps. transfer your beer to bottling bucket after adding 3/4 cup of corn sugar boiled in a cup of h20 unless using priming tabs. Then invite those who gave you bottles back over in about a month and say thanks by letting them taste your beer.  Everyone is happy  Cheers|`|zWaIjJKXaa	I do not recommend using old glass bottles, unless they were beer bottles.. It is safer to use plastic. If you do use glass bottles especially note that breweries nowadays use bottles that are designed for one use only; their walls are relatively thin and any damage can weaken them considerably. Like you said is possible to purchase special purpose re-useable stronger glass bottles but if you cant get them plastic is worthwhile - small changes in variables like how much sugar you add to the bottles can cause explosions and I have had several bottles explode - thankfully not when I was opening them (heard several loud thuds in the laundry and upon investigation found there'd been an explosive domino effect).  This was because storage of filled bottles at high temperatures causes gas release from the beer and increase the risk of explosion - and my laundry was too warm. In summary - only use glass bottles if they're new and made for the purpose, or old beer bottles in good condition. Enjoy.|`|TKbYavhzaa	No!  Unless it is a carbonated liquor.  The gas buildup during the bottle-fermentation process could cause the bottle to explode, if it's not built to handle the pressure.      You can use old soda bottles, although it feels a little ghetto drinking beer out of plastic.    I drank Grolsch beer for a while, just so I could collect the flip-top bottles - they make the whole bottling process nice and easy (no capping).    Anyway, I think you've got time.  I used to bottle after one week of vat fermentation, but I've gone as long as 5 weeks without any ill effects.
