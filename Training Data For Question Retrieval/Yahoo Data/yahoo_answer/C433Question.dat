20090307201244AAGCaKV	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How can I repair a crack/gouge in a hardwood floor?	We just finished installing all new pre-finished maple hardwood floors in our kitchen and dining room.  They look absolutely beautiful, but we have a slight problem.  While we were moving our appliance back into the kitchen, we accidentally caused a crack in one of the wood planks and gouged/dented a few areas.  We used an appliance dolly to move the appliances back, so this must have happened as we were unloading the refrigerator to put it back in its place.  We have wood putty, but I know that this probably won't fix the crack or the gouges.  Please help!!!!  We have plenty of wood leftover, but we really don't want to have to rip up those planks and install all new ones!

Okay, so me and my friends found this place near the golf course that has a ton of wood laying around. And we have an idea of making a little clubhouse out of it.      Hold Backs & Good Things:   B-Well, we really can't tell our parents about our little idea.   G-We already have the wood to build it.   G-My Dad has a TON of nails, and we could use a hammer for a couple hours, and there's another hammer that we found on the way there.   G-My friend has a pocketknife (Don't worry, I've been her friend for YEARS!)   G-We have a sledgehammer and some rope we found.         Bottom line is.... should we build it?      IMPORTANT: We aren't gonna build an ACTUAL tree house, just gonna build a roof and some chairs. And the path to the site is pretty straight. It's like someone had been there before.

I thought the price was ok because 2 other people were charging me $1000 and $1200 two or three years ago.  A friend of mine told me that the price was cheap because the electrician did not replace the wires that run thru the house and that could be unsafe.  Is rewiring necessary when replacing a fuse box for a circuit breaker box? I am concern that the old wires could not make the circuit breaker box work as expected or cause problems with the wires and overheat or something like that.  Could that be a problem?

I read that for concrete basement walls, you should use insulation that does not have any vapor barrier on it because it could trap moisture inside the wall.  I've never had any moisture in my basement.  For anyone with experience in this area, is this correct or can I use insulation that is kraft faced?  The reason I ask is because I am having trouble finding insulation that is not kraft faced.  Thank for the help.

20070501102642AAQKLrU	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Estimation of Quantities Of Concrete?	Hi there, I’ve been given a coursework asking me to "Estimate the quantities of concrete needed to build a house". Ive been given drawings, but they don’t give many measurements and figures. I think I am to assume certain measurements and make guesses where I see relevant.        I first need too identify all the concrete elements, what would theses be? Footings, foundation walls, slabs, blocks, colums and beams?      I then need to determine the voulme for all these conceret elements in metric as I’m in europe. The measurements I am working with are       15.200 - Width   13.300 - Length    88.05 -  height of structure from ground level to roof.    SSL 30-250 (Structural slab level)      Ive included the elevations and plans with this post, if that makes anything clearer. I understand to work out volume I need to use the following formula. Although I don’t know the depth.       Volume = Length x Width x Height (depth)       I’d be grateful for any help and knowledge

I am guessing that someone washed it, because only the lace outer shell faded from hunter green to kind of a bronze color. The trim on the collar and the inner lining slip remained hunter green. Otherwise, it is too pretty of a dress to throw out!
