20090222180640AAA8njj	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Getting rid of mould on clothes if you live in the tropics?	I live in Darwin, and we've recently moved into an older apartment, that is ventilated by louvres and fans. In less than two weeks many of the clothes in our wardrobe have been attacked by mould. I have two questions.      1. Can we save our clothes? We've tried spraying things with a mixture of oil of cloves and water before (when living in another place) and that's seemed to prevent further mould, but not cleaned the clothes already 'infected'. It's the wet season right now, so we can't hang clothes in the sun - it won't be sunny here for months!      2. How do we reduce mould in the future? Our room is constantly open for ventilation, and we don't have doors on our wardrobe. I've read about de-humidifiers, but I don't think that's going to work in this case!      Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I just need some noise reduction techniques to fix the solution. i was thinking that egg crate foam that the sell for bedding, but i would prefer black and they don't sell it in black.      Any ideas?      Also if i did use the white egg crate foam and but black cloth on top of it (loosely) would it ruin the noise canceling effect?

20090222225918AAfTsYU	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Is it safe to nail between the layers of plywood?	I'm building a box that's 1 ft^3 and the only wood I'm allowed to use is 1/2 inch fir plywood.  That requires me to nail the face to the perpendicular layers of another piece.  I also have to stand on this box and I'm around 230 lbs.  There will be slight horizontal force when I step on the box so I'm scared that'll cause the nail to shred right through the wood.  Will that be fine or is there a stronger and relatively easier way to join and fasten the plywood together.      Sorry if I sound like a noob, because I am.

20070606032433AAao1Ri	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Touching up scuffs marks on paint.?	I have a low sheen acrylic style paint in my house.   Today i noticed some scuff marks on the walls so i decided to get an old tin of paint with leftover out (only a few months old), and touch them up with a brush.    I let it dry for half hour or so, and just standing in front of it i could not see any problem, however when i walked around and let the outside light catch the wall i could clearly see where i had touched up the wall. it appears more shiny than the old area.   i thought it might be coz of the brush strokes so i got out a roller and rolled over the patches with paint.   After a couple of hours i could STILL see where i had painted with the roller - not by just looking at it face on, but by standing at an angle to the wall - where the sunlight from outside was shining on it.   On the can it says something about taking up to 7 days for full film to cure, but im not sure this will make any difference. Ive never heard of this b4.   Its the EXACT same paint as before!! any idea's??
