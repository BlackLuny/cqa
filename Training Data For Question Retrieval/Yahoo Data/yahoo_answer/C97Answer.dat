So9KRcTHaa	It seems like you are serious about joining the National Guard and you want to do so for the right reasons.  If you aren't 18 then you won't be able to do much about your desire to serve until you legally become an adult.  The earliest you would be able to go any way is 17 with your parent's consent.  If it is truly your desire to serve your country, you can do so as soon as you are 18 and your parents cannot stop you. If they don't support you that's very sad but not an actual obstacle to you.  If they threaten to cut you off and you can't support yourself, you can always go active duty US Army and they will take care of you.  Your parents should be proud to have daughter with the courage and maturity to make the commitment to serve in the military.  Military service is a great way to learn what it is to be a mature adult and how to be successful at what ever it is you do.  I think that they will see how wrong they were when they see what you have grown to be after basic training.|`|lP04jzv6aa	you will not always make people you love happy. If the service is you calling you need to go. If its not you need to decide.|`|7n523JW1aa	If your parents aren't proud of you decision it's understandable because they don't want their kid to get hurt but they should also be proud.|`|esOaJoqBaa	Let your parents know that this is what you really want and this is what you think will make you happy. If they can't understand that then it doesn't matter. At some point you need to make your own choices and move away from them anyway. You can't let them make your decisions for you. Do what you need to do.<br>  If your parents can't accept your decisions and recognize that you are trying to be happy then that is there problem, not yours.|`|neWbgaHCaa	If that's what you really want to do and you are not 18 yet just wait until you are and do it.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	well if your parents arent proud of you thats a shame. the military is a great place and has takin care of me and my family for alot of years. Im proud of you and if they cant support you then oh well they will get over it.|`|sMNEooBVaa	It should not be up to your parents to decide what your calling is, only you know. If that is what you want then they will have to live with it. Good Luck!|`|n2oEhdZiaa	They will come around once they see that it has been a good opportunity for you.  It may take a while.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Your parents can't shoot your dream down unless you allow them to.  <br>  <br>  While it is good to listen to their advice and consider their input, ultimately, it is going to be your decision.  <br>  <br>  You really need to consider how important that you believe it is for you to be in the military.  If you allow their reason (the military is not a place for women) to derail your dream, then you may very well regret changing for that alone.<br>   <br>  Understand that the reason they said that is probably more out of concern that they do not believe the military is the place for the one woman that they birthed to be in.  In other words, their response may first be dictated by fear for you more than anything else.

Yesterday, it came to light Freeman has financial ties to the infamous bin Laden family – including dealings he defended after Sept. 11, 2001.<br>  <br>  Freeman served as president of the Middle East Policy Council, a Washington-based Saudi backed nonprofit that received tens of thousands of dollars per year from the bin Laden family and other Saudi donors.<br>  <br>  In 2003, Freeman's council joined with California-based Arab World and Islamic Resources in selling to U.S. schools the "Arab World Studies Notebook," set to be a textbook on Arab issues and history.<br>  <br>  A report from that year by the Text Book League, an online resource on some 200 educational items for middle-school and high-school educators, highlighted major historical fabrications found in Freeman's schoolbook including the claim Muslims inhabited the New World in pre-Columbian times and also spread throughout the Caribbean, Central America, South America and even Canada.<br>  <br>  An investigative article by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2005 further exposed some of the anti-Israel claims in the book Freeman was peddling.<br>  <br>  The JTA found the book described Jerusalem as unequivocally "Arab," characterized Jewish residence in the holy city as "settlement"; labeled the "question of Jewish lobbying" against "the whole question of defining American interests and concerns"; and suggested the Quran "synthesizes and perfects earlier revelations."<br>  <br>  Freeman lauded Hamas as the only democratically elected government in the Arab world and claimed the terrorist group "is showing that if we offer it nothing but unreasoning hostility and condemnation, it will only stiffen its position and seek allies among our enemies. In both cases, we forfeit our influence for no gain."<br>  <br>  Furthermore, he had business ties to Osama bin Laden's family and strongly defended the connections after 9/11.<br>  <br>  Rinsdberg documented how as chairman of Projects International, Inc., a company that develops worldwide business deals, Freeman declared in an Associated Press interview just after the 9/11 attacks he was still "discussing proposals with the Bin Laden Group – and that won't change."<br>  <br>  The Bin Laden Group is a multinational construction conglomerate and holding company for the assets owned by the bin Laden family. It was founded in 1950 by Sheik Mohammed bin Laden, father of the terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.<br>  <br>  Freeman told the AP companies that have "had very long and profitable relationships are now running for public relations cover."<br>  <br>  He said bin Laden remains "a very honored name" in the Saudi kingdom.<br>  <br>  In a separate interview Sept. 28, 2001, Freeman told the Wall Street Journal he spoke at the time to two of Osama bin Laden's brothers following the mega terrorist attacks. He said they told him the FBI had been "remarkably sensitive, tactful and protective" of the family during the current crisis.<br>  <br>  Freeman's ties to the bin Laden family went beyond admiration and business.

If all of that stimulation that was said by liberals to be the cause of our economic difficulties didn't get us going, how will 10% of the GNP going to pork due so?  The previous debt was nowhere near what he projects and taxing business at an even higher rate then the god awful current rate plus middle class and up Americans that buy things making them spend even less means the record government income of the last six years will also come to and end making things even worse.

You need to see these graphs buddy. It's a question of the magnitude of the borrowing. It's one thing to borrow say 1-5% of your gross national product, but its an entirely different thing to increase your debt to several times historical levels at a time when your economy is looking increasingly less competitive: <br>  <br>  Monetary Inflation:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNS8IY_Td14" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNS8IY_Td...</a><br>  <br>  Deficit over the past 60 years:<br>  <a href="http://caseyresearch.com/images/Federal%20Deficit%20Borrowing%203.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://caseyresearch.com/images/Federal%...</a><br>  <br>  There are hundreds of other disturbing indicators. When someone tells you that there is only one way out of this recession (on either side) they are lying to you. Economics is a social science there are no correct answers, just "correctish" answers. For instance, according to Keynes, who the U.S. follows, we should spend. According to another legitimate model, the Austrian Mises model, we shouldn't. The fact is debt lead to our trouble and I find it hard to believe it will lead us out unless we are capable of paying it off. Given the level of the debt compared to our GDP and the likelihood of industrial recovery, I think we're making a huge mistake. <br>  <br>  For a comparison of the New Deal to the Stimulus go to:<br>  <a href="http://moderncounterculture.com/?p=91" rel="nofollow">http://moderncounterculture.com/?p=91</a>|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Consider something else.  There is a population decline and the number of people supporting the debt is decreasing.  The Baby boomers should be dead by 2050 but every generation, thereafter is substantially smaller.  The GNP is declining.  It is not just simply how much debt but how repayment shall be accomplished over time out of a declining population size. <br>  <br>  The focus of the conservatives is not so much on the who (grandchild) but the how.  You have over simplified a complex issue.  The value of money nor land is the same as in the years/events that you mentioned.|`|KZh3x4g9aa	not to worry,the liberals are aborting babies as I type this .there will not be enough grand kids to pay for anything.....

Of course they are going to check up on you.  Pretty routine.  You should have expected it.  If your interview passes muster, you will get your unemployment.|`|QnLFZPpOaa	Everything will be fine. This happened to me too. All they do is ask you information about what your doing as far as getting more work.

They do this just to make sure your not just collecting with the intention of milking it all the way. Hope this helps.
AA11966821	You should have called for supervisor immediately.  Get an attorney to see what action you can take against the examiner, file complaint or suit as necessary, etc.  This sort of thing is totally offensive.  Examiners should be required to speak, read and write clear, grammatical and intelligible/legible English, and personal bias and retaliation against someone who cannot understand an inadequate examiner is an intolerable affront.  His behavior is totally unprofessional and unacceptable in a government employee.  Go after him.<br>  <br>  Supposedly, a civil service employee cannot be fired, but there is an exception for "gross incompetence" among a rare few others.

yX4xVukPaa	This is going to be a very long answer.<br>  <br>  1. Geographical Distribution of Power<br>  There are (broadly speaking) three geographical layers of power in the UK: national government, which has its centre in London, at Westminster, local government in the form of local authorities and associated local branches of government services - the police, local education authorities, local NHS trusts - and devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br>  The national government in Westminster has the majority of the power, and contains both the principle executive and legislative branches (in that Parliament is a part of the Westminister power structure rather than other levels of government). The legal principle of Parliamentary Supremacy means that Parliament can make or unmake any law, and therefore in theory can overrule decisions made in the other layers of government. However, constitutional convention, political expediency and the power of judicial interpretation prevent any parliament from actually doing so. In most cases using parliamentary supremacy in an extreme way would merely precipitate a constitutional crisis, likely to involve the dissolution of parliament and new elections.<br>  Local authorities are generally underfunded. There is a low turnout in local elections. They are principally responsible for local services such as rubbish collection, and the largest item in their budget is usually funding of the police. Local Authority funding is provided in part by central government and the remainder by local taxation of buisnesses and "council tax" based on the value of real property owned.<br>  <br>  The devolved governments have limited legislative and executive power. They are elected within the area of devolution and can only make law on certain matters within that area, for example, on education.<br>  <br>  2. Relationship between Legislature and the Executive<br>  There is a partial fusion of Legislature and Executive in the UK. The head of the executive (the prime minister) is chosen nominally by the Queen, but is, by convention, the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister chooses Ministers to form a government with him. All of these ministers are members of the Lords or the Commons, so the entire political element of the executive are also members of the legislature. <br>  <br>  The executive exerts further influence over the legislature because of the party political system. Almost all MPs are members of a political party. That party pressures them to vote in line with party, often by threats to de-select them as MP for that party and make it likely that they will loose their seat at the next election. This system, known as "whipping" is only effective in the House of Commons (the elected house), members of the Lords are very difficult to remove and are therefore harder to influence.<br>  <br>  The upshot of all this is that the ruling party, because it is chosen on the basis of having a commons majority, will usually be able to pass whatever legislation it wants to. Only legislation which is seriously unpopular within the party will be likely to lead to a "rebellion" among MPs.<br>  <br>  The only significant check withing the legislative process on this de facto power of the executive to legislate is that the Lords can block most Commons legislation. The Commons can force legislation through under the Parliament Acts, but in the case of controversial legislation, particularly if it is likely to effect human rights and traditional areas of personal freedom. Recently the government's attempt to increase detention without charge  to 42 days was blocked by the Lords. The government chose to let the matter drop.<br>  <br>  3. Participants in Government<br>  The most important members of the government are the members of the Cabinet - limited to about 20 ministers (though technically the limitation is that there can only by so many *paid* members of cabinet), together with those who hold certain posts such as the Lord Chancellor. After them there are many junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries, as well as various high official positions such as the Lords Chancellor, Attorney general etc. Then there is the civil service, which is political neutral, and directed by the political elements of the government.<br>  The UK has universal suffrage for all those over the age of 18 who are not ineligible for some reason (such as being insane). Formerly women were ineligible (up until the early 20th Century), and at earlier times ability to vote was based on owning land above a certain value.<br>  <br>  4. History of Government<br>  The present form of government evolved over nearly 1000 years, from the Norman Conquest to the present day. There have been many changes, shifts in the balance of power and so on. The practice of the King having some chief minister on who he relied dates back to Tudor times, and the Houses of Parliament are even older. The Constitutional position of the monarchy is largely a product of the English Civil War
tcA1w24jaa	Hitting someone with a brick if they hit you with their fists is not self-defense because it is an unnecessary escalation of the situation. With a brick being a deadly weapon and all, your cousin is probably looking at aggrivated assault with a deadly weapon, which can be up to a life term and a class I fealony depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news - but you're not allowed to make a bad situation worse and claim 'self defense'|`|K1oOQqqVaa	You don't hit someone with a brick in self defense.  Deal with reality.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Sounds like there is more to this story that hasn't been told.  If your cousin is in jail, they are likely considering charges against him for this incident.<br>  <br>  At this point, there is no point in filing a police report against the other person.  Your cousin needs a lawyer.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Sounds like your cousin needs a lawyer. <br>  <br>  I'm no expert in the law, but in order for the police to file charges against the other teen, they would need to have enough evidence that he committed a crime. Lacking that evidence, they won't file charges because nothing could be proved in court. <br>  <br>  At this point it's going to be up to your cousin (or his lawyer) to prove that it was self defense and get the district attorney to drop the charges. Otherwise he will have to convince a jury that he acted in self defense.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  For what it's worth, there is a difference between someone filing a report and the police actually arresting someone and charging them with a crime. Filing a report only tells the police that you believe a crime was committed. They may investigate your report, but they won't make an arrest or file charges unless they have evidence a crime was committed.|`|sIwwznnOaa	Well, I hope your cousin has a lawyer.

If you are selling narcotics or being charged with driving on a suspended license because of a drunken driving charge, your car will likely be impounded.  If you are alone and arrested for a regular charge the police will often leave your car at the site if it is properly parked and not on private property.

Therefore no nation has unlimited funds to spend on health care.<br>  <br>  2) In all of the nations which have 'universal health care" aka "single payer" health care, the strictly administrative costs of the system = 17% of the total billed.  In the US that administrative amount =34%.<br>  <br>  3) (.17) times the $300,000,000.00 a year we pay for health care = $5,100,000.00.  Surely some of that savings should be reflected in lower premiums for those whom pay the bills?   <br>  <br>  4) It is not necessarily that the government will nationalize the health care system, but that there will be one insurance company, one insurance pool, and the larger the pool, the smaller the individual rates.  And surely that should lower the premium of whomever is paying the bill?<br>  <br>  5) Even if you take Etna insurance, or Blue cross Blue Shield or Kaiser permanente HMO as the sole insurer, and pay their CEO the ridiculous salary of $3,000,000.00 and an obscenr bonus of $17,000,000.00 the savings to my employer will be something.<br>  <br>  6) And if medicare gets the bid, we can eliminate ths bonus and $17 million has to go somewhere.<br>  <br>  7)  And with one payer, one computer system (whose ever), and only having to spend time settling billing problems with one company instead of dozens will have to further lower those billing expenses. Which can only lower costs and either improve care or lower costs.|`|Fyq5nK4waa	Businesses will not save money on Universal Health Care.  Health Care is a three sided triangle.  Side one is cost, side two is quality, side three is speed.

The people suffer. <br>  <br>  You can have high quality and fast access, then the cost will increase to cover new technology.

The people suffer.  <br>  <br>  The current system just needs some minor adjustments.  <br>  1. Hospitals and Physicians should post their costs, range of cost for procedures. One cost, not multiple costs for different insurances and self pay. <br>  2. Hospitals and Physicians should post their outcomes.  <br>  3.

fKFvzlzQaa	Taking the oil is not the way to handle the problem.<br>  <br>  the way to handle the problem is to become oil independent where we do not have to import oil from The Middle East. <br>  <br>  We also need to help China and India become oil independent so they do not have to import oil from The Middle East.<br>  <br>  That will reduce the demand for oil sufficiently to keep the price low. As long as the price of oil is kept low, the Muslim Terrorists nations, such as Iran will not have the surpluses necesary to support Muslim Terrorist groups or pursue nuclear weapons.<br>  <br>  We need to get over the hysteria with respect to nuclear power plants.

0eFSeap5aa	You raise a good point, one that seems to be missed by economists with Nobel prizes.<br>  <br>  What you refer to is the paradox of thrift.  It is the idea that if people save instead of buying then the people who would make or sell that stuff are now out of a job which hurts the economy.  It's bullshit.  The people who thought up and/or advance this notion are either being deliberately misleading or just plain stupid.  Either way they should be spayed along with the cat.<br>  <br>  Wealth isn't produced by spending, it's produced through work, and the right kind of work.  To do that right kind of work means using tools that could not be acquired unless people saved and invested their wealth.<br>  <br>  The paradox of thrift assumes that savings go into a black hole, which as evidenced by the real estate bust, sometimes is true.  But when that money is invested wisely it is used to create new wealth.  The production of that wealth will require labor, so the people that didn't make money selling you some useless trinket now make it building a factory or a hospital.<br>  <br>  That there is a danger that people won't spend is ridiculous.  We all need food, shelter, clothes, etc.  People buy, it's when we have no wealth to feed our appetite that spending contracts.  <br>  <br>  Savings, investment, and work does create wealth.  Consuming exhausts that wealth.  As long as we make more than we take we get richer.  As we are finding out now, doing the opposite doesn't last for long.|`|LNFg5KMuaa	Spending isn't bad in any way.  It's only when you spend what you don't have, or in other words, go into debt.  When a CEO spends thousands of dollars to renovate his office people think that's bad, but it's not because the economy is still getting stimulated by money going directly to the employees and business that did the renovation, such as painters, carpenters...etc.  Same with a private jet, people think it's bad but people don't realize the maintenance and upkeep on a jet that generates money and jobs for the company that makes and does upkeep on the jets.  Politicians want you to believe that any way of spending money other than government spending is bad, but it's completely opposite.|`|RVdAXPDRaa	I would be of the opinion that we should spend responsibly & save a certain amount of our money at the same time. What will bring the economy back into line will be people's need for cars & a rebuilding of the auto manufacturers business.Just think of the many, many industries that are shut down due to the fact that cars are not selling.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I agree with you. Why would you buy a $500,000 house when you make only $50,000 a year. Yeah bad habits and weak regulation from the government have gotten us into this.

Its poor decision making on the part of CEO's who spend 50k for a charter plane to Hawaii and spend another 100k while there. Poor investment choices, poor management and an increase in the cost of living as well as a loss of confidence in the green back and declines in wall street are to blame.<br>  <br>  But its not just us. Its the rest of the world too. And before you do thinking we're on the brink of another great depression (with bread lines and 25% or high unemployment) try to keep in mind that you can still go to Wal-Mart and buy a nintendo wii, some avocados and chips for dip. Try going to say Brazil. You can't expect to be able to buy the same luxuries there and if you do, its a lot more expensive.<br>  <br>  We are in a pickle, one that has the potential to get far worse. But I think buy creating new jobs and investing in alternative sources of energy, we can help to stabilize the situation. In the mean time try not not to believe all the hype and scare mongering on the part of mass media.

When conservatives ask this question, and the most famous was Reagan, it hence reveals a profound ignorance of reality. So much so that it makes you wonder about the psychological sanity of the questioner. In the case of Reagan, it is well known he has Alzheimer's disease, and perhaps that is what led him to ask such a ridiculous black and white question such as this one.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	You could argue either angle. Right now, maybe a solution in that government can create jobs and boost the economy by putting people to work. But also a problem by handing out reckless bail outs to companies that were mismanaged anyway. I suppose we could break it down like this:<br>  <br>  Government being pocketed by big business - problem<br>  Government passing legislation to invest in alternative energy and reduce dependence on foreign oil - solution<br>  Government going on a 14+ trillion dollar debt to the Chinese - problem<br>  Government working on a bipartisan plan for affordable health care and education - solution<br>  Government nationalizing businesses through bail outs - problem<br>  Government paying for my college - solution (for me anyways)<br>  Government misappropriating tax dollars to ear marked spending - problem<br>  Government corruption - problem<br>  People getting involved in the process and finding ways to save and safely invest money - solution.<br>  <br>  We can point the finger at government all we want, but we the people are the ones who put them in office. While we want government to change (whether your democrat or republican or neither), we should also consider changing ourselves and how we live and make an effort as a nation to restore our greatness.

Both are excellent opportunities to serve your country so once you've decided you want to serve your country in the US Military and are absolutely positive that is what you want do, find out if youare qualified.  Only about one out of every six people are qualified to serve in the US Armed Forces. If you're qualified decide how you want to serve.  If you are looking to stay in for 20 to 30 years it's really all about what you would like to do the most.  If you want to serve for a term of enlistment, get your educational benefits and get out with a job skill you can use in the private sector, the Navy might be for you.

The last time I appeared our dialogue regarding Obama was so great that I turned out to be the longest guest ever, being on for 1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  My appearance will help in our efforts to spread the word as the major media continues to refuse to cover this story – the most significant story in the history of our country; the biggest "HOAX" perpetrated on the citizens of the United States in 230 years, since our nation was established. Obama must be legally removed from office.”<br>  <br>  Berg continued, “I believe that 10 to 15 million people are aware of the Obama 'HOAX,' and we must make 75 million people aware.

A9vvZ6eUaa	That was not the objective of the Allies in WW2.  The objective was the gain alliance with Russia and gain control over Europe to eventually have victory over Germany.  The holocaust was not even fully discovered till the end of the war.  Germany made a declaration of war, the allies just returned it.  This was never about the Holocaust. <br>  <br>  You need to pick up a few history books. The UN did not exist in WW2|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	The UN? Dude, that wasnt formed until 1945... in reaction to WWII and to prevent anything from happening like that again.<br>  <br>  <br>  And why didnt the US do anything? Well we had an isolationist policy at the time and felt it wasnt our business. (pretty bad i know, but them are the facts).

It was physically impossible for the UN to even comment on the Holocaust when it was happening.|`|mULVP4k4aa	For one there was no UN in the 30s and 40s. The world was very divided. The closest thing was the league of nations. In Europe they were almost in denial, Britains Prime Minister Chamberlain gave Hitler a section of Czechslovokia which made them deffenseless and allowed HItler to sweep in and invade, mean while in America the War protest were so rampad that it took peral Harbor for the U.S, to get involved. But even then Hitler and Nazi Germany was so powerful that ultimatly it took the Soviet Union to turn the tide. Finally in 1945 Germany surrendered and that left the decision to bomb Heroshima Japan with a nuke so that they would surrender without having to invade. The hope was that the bombing would save lives (which it probably did) but still cost more than 100,000 deaths, a very tough and contriversal war time decision.|`|AA11728349	You need to go to a book store and buy the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

As to why the U.S. didn't respond faster, Democrat President Roosevelt wanted to keep his Socialist British buddies and Communist USSR  buddies happy, so he let them set the priorities for how the war was conducted.

PT at LEAST three times a week is now mandatory, and Commanders are obligated to give troops time to work out (this used to be optional, but frankly never found a Commander who was opposed to his/her troops working out/playing sports).  <br>  - Gyms, tracks, pools are all very well maintained over all.|`|q0gnYRPKaa	Easiest?

I also worked out regularly before I joined so that made it much easier for me than others.  It sounds like you won't have much trouble either so I wouldnt worry about this aspect too much.  The TIs will focus their yelling and energy on the larda$$es who can't do 20 pushups or situps and need the extra attention.  If you are already in good shape you will go completely unnoticed during PT at basic.<br>  <br>  Yes, Air Force bases are generally very nice and provide excellent workout facilities.  After tech school however, it will be up to you to find the motiviation to utilize these facilities.  You will find many in the Air Force have clearly let themselves go physically over time.  To me there is no excuse for getting fat and out of shape in the Air Force because of the great opportunities available to stay in shape.  I would like to see changes to the PT program soon which may emulate the Army and Marines PT in some ways.<br>  <br>  Overall the Air Force is great, but you will get out of it what you put into it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !

If you read your history, you would see Germany's economic collapse was due to the terms of the surrender they had to sign, not because of the action of Jews.

With so many people on unemployment and TWO wars...it will continue to climb at the same rate that baby Bush's debt rose outlined in the link below.  So, you are blaming this on Obama who has been President for a little over a month.  Do you suggest that we do nothing like Hoover did?  Continue paying people unemployment to do nothing or use that unemployment to put people rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.  I don't know about you..but I would rather have something to show for my tax dollars, even if it is repairing the sewer system.  <br>  <br>  At the link below, you might want to note the spike up during the Clinton administration when he hired more police for the country...and created jobs.  Then note he spike down on the debt.  AFTER the creation of jobs.  <br>  <br>  Pulling troops out of one war...and letting the huge Bush tax cuts for the very very rich will make a difference.  And so will putting people back to work OFF of unemployment and welfare. <br>  <br>  During my research at the site below, I read that during the early years when the US was at war...taxes were high to PAY for that war.  But I think this blurb kinda tells the story and remember..the speculators drove up the price of gas:<br>  <br>  Double Whammy:   50-Year Record on Sept. 22.    $10 Trillion on Sept. 30, 2008.<br>  <br>  The gross national debt compared to GDP (how rich we are) reached its lowest level since 1931 as Reagan took office in 1981. It skyrocketed for 12 years through Bush senior. Clinton reversed it at a peak of 67%. Bush junior crossed that line on Sept. 22 and hit 69% on Sept 30. That's the highest it's been since 1955.   (sources)<br>  Bush did three things to skyrocket the debt from $5.7 trillion to $10 trillion:<br>  1. He lowered taxes on the rich (by far the biggest item).<br>  2. He invaded Iraq instead of winning in Afghan-Pakistan (another $600 B).<br>  3. He deregulated Wall Street speculators. That bailout has now "invested" $1T

It doesn't matter whether you think you're being a "good Samaritan" by helping two little old ladies cross the street.<br>  <br>  Actually, I'm kind of surprised that the police officer in question would have helped take the guy to the hospital.  I thought police officers were there to enforce the laws, not to deal with idiots who get themselves hurt because of their own actions.<br>  <br>  By the way, who's going to pay the hospital bills for the bus driver?

On our days off, we get recalls, or commander calls, etc.<br>  <br>  Free time is hard to come by as a military member, and that stress is put onto the family itself.<br>  <br>  However, if your husband is in the military, and is deployed, he is considered active duty in my books.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Listen, military wives are feral cats.

According the United States Government, it is:<br>  <br>  a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. It also applies to employment agencies and to labor organizations, as well as to the federal government.<br>  <br>  Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.<br>  <br>  Sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including but not limited to the following:<br>  <br>  The victim as well as the harasser may be a woman or a man. The victim does not have to be of the opposite sex. <br>  The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, an agent of the employer, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a non-employee. <br>  The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct. <br>  Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to or discharge of the victim. <br>  The harasser's conduct must be unwelcome. <br>  It is helpful for the victim to inform the harasser directly that the conduct is unwelcome and must stop. The victim should use any employer complaint mechanism or grievance system available.<br>  <br>  When investigating allegations of sexual harassment, EEOC looks at the whole record: the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances, and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. A determination on the allegations is made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.<br>  <br>  Prevention is the best tool to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace. Employers are encouraged to take steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring. They should clearly communicate to employees that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. They can do so by providing sexual harassment training to their employees and by establishing an effective complaint or grievance process and taking immediate and appropriate action when an employee complains.<br>  <br>  It is also unlawful to retaliate against an individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate based on sex or for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under Title VII.

BSEyeMoMaa	Philip J. Berg, Esquire, the first Attorney who filed suit against Barack H. Obama challenging Senator Obama's lack of Constitutional "qualifications/eligibility" to serve as President of the United States and his cases that are still pending, Berg vs. Obama [2 cases – 1 under seal] and Hollister vs. Soetoro a/k/a Obama announced today that he will be on Michael Savage Nation tonight at 6:30 p.m. E.S.T.<br>  <br>  Berg stated, “I am thrilled to be on Savage Nation as Michael Savage has a widespread audience [10 million listeners who tune into Savage each week - on WOR in New York, KNEW in San Francisco, WKRO in Boston, or hundreds of other stations nationwide] and Michael asks the tough questions. The last time I appeared our dialogue regarding Obama was so great that I turned out to be the longest guest ever, being on for 1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  My appearance will help in our efforts to spread the word as the major media continues to refuse to cover this story – the most significant story in the history of our country; the biggest "HOAX" perpetrated on the citizens of the United States in 230 years, since our nation was established. Obama must be legally removed from office.”<br>  <br>  Berg continued, “I believe that 10 to 15 million people are aware of the Obama 'HOAX,' and we must make 75 million people aware. When people are made aware of the Obama 'HOAX,' that Obama has not proven he is constitutionally 'qualified/eligible' to be President; that Obama has not produced his original (vault version) 'Birth Certificate;' that Obama has not produced legal documents to show he legally changed his name from his 'adopted' name of 'Barry Soetoro' from Indonesia; they will demand Obama be removed from his office of President of the United States."<br>  <br>  Berg concluded, "I am proceeding for the 305 + million people in 'our' U.S.A., for 'our' forefathers and for the tens of thousands of men and women that have died and/or been maimed defending our Constitution, with our legal fight to prove that Obama is not constitutionally qualified/eligible to be President."<br>  <br>  The following is an update on my three [3] pending cases regarding my challenge to Obama's lack of qualifications/eligibility to be President.<br>  <br>  Also, I am preparing to file a 4th case - Quo Warranto [challenge person in office - that does not meet the qualifications].<br>  <br>  As you know, I was the first to legally raise the issue - having filed my lawsuit on August 21, 2008, before the DNC Convention<br>  <br>  Status of Cases:<br>  <br>  Berg vs. Obama, Third Circuit Court of Appeals No. 08 – 4340<br>  Berg filed Brief on 1/20/09<br>  Response Briefs from Obama, DNC and FEC filed on 2/17/09 (Appellees)<br>  This is the case that was dismissed in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of PA<br>  Judge Surrick dismissed for lack of "standing" by Philip J.

4f3cjyw7aa	It's illegal to work under the table because you aren't paying taxes on it.  According to the IRS, you need to pay taxes on any income over $600.  The employees will have big problems especially if they are illegal aliens.  The business will also have big legal problems if they get caught, along with the managers.  It's against the law to hire illegal aliens, that's why they only get paid as little as they do on a cash basis.<br>  <br>  It's funny because $7.00 an hour non-taxed is only 40 cents less than if they were paid "on the table" ($8.75 an hour in the 15% tax bracket comes out to $7.44).  Once you factor in state taxes, social security, and all that other fun stuff, the guy making $7.00 under the table is actually making more than minimum wage!|`|vCXZcxyAaa	The goverment can't take taxes and social security out of the money.<br>  <br>  I don't know who all gets in trouble.|`|AA12253571	The problem is in not paying taxes.<br>  <br>  I think only the employer gets hit for giving less than minimum wage, but if you don't pay taxes on your income, that's a bigger issue.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Each of them will be in violation of different federal laws and will be sentenced accordingly.

Personnel should know how to do it. They are very limited and the sooner you ask the better.  Trying to do it once you get there although possible is really difficult.  Fortunately for you, they are in the process of adjusting command sponsored tours in Korea to 3 year tours and Camp Humphries just got a new school and other new facilities built on it. As far as how long it takes is up to your husbands gaining commander.  They manage all of the command sponsored billets under their control and they have to determine if it is worth it to give someone in your husband's MOS and pay grade a 3 year tour. There is no way to know|`|AA12159695	Well usually Korea is a dependent restricted tour, so they have a home base Program where the army will send you to where your husband chooses.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Please note that I am not a lawyer and the following is only my non-legal opinion, based upon reading the Texas statutes on sexual assault.  Anyway, I am not sure if statutory rape applies.  It depends upon the age of when the sexual activity started.  Also, in Texas, the fact that there is less than a three year age difference and the activity was consentual is a "apparently" defence.<br>  <br>  This is Chapter 21 of the Texas Penal Code dealing with sexual offenses:<br>  <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/DocViewer.aspx?K2DocKey=odbc%3a%2f%2fSOTW%2fASUPUBLIC.dbo.vwSOTW%2fPE%2fS%2fPE.21%40SOTW&QueryText=%22sexual+intercourse%22&HighlightType=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Do...</a><br>  <br>  My advice is the following...he stop doing having sex with her until she turns 18.  He definitely does not make her pregnant.  And he obtains independent, competent legal advice from a licenced lawyer, and not rely on information gleaned on the internet!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12109395	There are several issues here:<br>  <br>  At their current ages, dating is legal, however if sex is involved, it falls under the statutory rape laws because she cannot legally consent to sex as a minor. If that were to become an issue, he has an affirmative defense that he is less than 3 years older than her and no force or coercion was involved therefore reducing the severity of potential charges. Understand that her parents, having legal authority over her, (could) bring charges. With the consent of her parents (he's an adult legally) what you suggest in your post (parental mutual agreement) might work. <br>  <br>  She can consent legally at 17 and but if she becomes pregnant and things get ugly,  potential charges would be based on her age at the time of conception.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	tough call,  Since they are both under the age of consent, I don't see too many legal problems, Only when he turns 18 and her parent's file charges. Otherwise they should be ok. The state usually has a 2 yr lea-way when it comes to age and dating.<br>  <br>  Make sure he is using protection and she also. This way they won't have to worry.|`|4f3cjyw7aa	Dating isn't illegal.  The law is pretty strict with statutory rape (sex with an underage person).  Even if it is consensual or she lied about her age, the guy can still be arrested for it.  I think the age of consent is 17 in Texas.  That means sex with any person, even if consensual, under the age of 17 is statutory rape.  Therefore, any sex with her would be considered statutory rape.<br>  <br>  Once she is 17, it's ok.  If she's not 17, then it's still statutory rape.  Not much else I can say because there really aren't any defenses to statutory rape and the law is very strict (it's like speeding, you either do it or you don't, all or nothing).
DFJ9m4WKaa	Where do you think license plates come from?<br>  <br>  There are work release programs as well. And some prisons do allow inmates to work community service (like picking up trash or digging ditches).<br>  <br>  What I think would be nice is if non-violent offenders had more access to programs that educated inmates and helped them to become productive members of society rather than just end up as repeat offenders and in and out of jail.

That doesn't necessarily mean that an ISP won't just give out the information at the mere sight of a police officer, but they HAVE to give out the information if there is a warrant.  You won't be able to see what the other person is doing, the ISP will and they will report that to the police.  But remember, an IP address doesn't always lead back to the culprit, with all of the WiFi "piggybacking" (using someone else's WiFi without their permission) it's difficult to actually find out who is doing what.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	yeah it was the hitler youth movement i think 13 or 14 full on army was 16|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Around the end of the war yes.  This was after the push into Russia when the German troops were just thouroughly embarrassed by the forces of the Russian military and after Russia took Poland back.  The Germans realized they didn't have enough men for their military so they started enlisting old men and young boys as old as 14.  Earlier in while they were making their push into Russia they were enlisting people from France who were of proper Aryan stock.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	It was not just young boy's at the end. The grandpa's were going to the fronts along with the kiddies.<br>  <br>  My Dad was with the 80th ID, 3rd Army. They got the fun job featured in the movie Patton of heading north to relieve the 101. The 4th Armored, 26th ID and 80th got into the last of the real heavy fighting with seasoned troops. By the time the 1st and 3rd got into Germany in late Feb 1945 they were facing kids and old men if any at all.|`|7n523JW1aa	No. He didn't just take people at random.

8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	It would depend on how specific the exclusivity clause was AND the compensation paid for that exclusivity.<br>  <br>  Here, we always include Ontario because it's like the next State over. Usually you'll see a clause that states "within 50 miles of a theater owned by "y." That sort of thing.<br>  <br>  If "y" has 450 theatres, it's a given that there's one near the border which would, most likely, be harmed by a Toronto showing. Kinda like the NHL which restricts franchises within a certain number of miles of another franchise. Hamilton has wanted a team for decades but Toronto and Buffalo keep blocking it.<br>  <br>  Is this what you meant?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Hey, Zen - what we do here is incorporate Toronto, or the GTA as it's referred to. Should a Canadian theatre in the GTA show the film, and your contract includes such huge compensation, you should be in good shape and have no trouble in requesting, and receiving, that the film be pulled immediately from the Toronto theatre.<br>  <br>  In ANY event, the GTA is considered a part of the Greater Buffalo Area of Commerce. Your damages would be a formula that's probably already been devised and used in the movie industry with which I'm unfamiliar. If it shows in TO for a month, obviously your damages would be a heck of a lot more than if it were shown for a day. Also consider if it goes to cable or DVD up in the Great White North! ;<}!!<br>  <br>  More clearly - our market includes Toronto and its environs, which includes almost 85% of the population of Canada.<br>  <br>  More - if a Buffalo Bills game is NOT sold out by the Thursday prior (rare-but it does happen) no TORONTO station is able to air the game.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	The courts would most likely find it to be a breach of contract.|`|3yrpDNavaa	Yes, that's a breach.  The remedy is damages.<br>  <br>  So, if the movie is playing in only one theater, in a market not even served by theater y, then obviously theater y has not lost much as a result of the breach, so it will be entltled to very little in the way of breach of contract damages.<br>  <br>  Of course, if a competing chain of 500 theaters in the U.S. were to begin showing the movie, then theater y's damages would be much greater.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where the first answerer gets that a contract "generally doesn't extend beyond the boundaries of the country in which it was written."  I've never heard of any such canon of interpretation.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Production company x has breached nothing<br>  <br>  "throughout the USA."<br>  <br>  Unless the contract specifies "USA and Canada" or "North America" then they are free to make a different distribution agreement with Canadian theatres.<br>  <br>  "even though the contract doesnt mention anything bout exclusivity boundaries, they still have a right to do so elsewhere?"<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes they do. Unless the contract is specific it generally doesn't extend beyond the boundaries of the country in which it was written.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: The  contract could POSSIBLY extend to Canada. There would be a 'non compete' clause in a contract like this. It would depend on where these American theatres were. If these 475 theatres are throught MI, MN and Northern Wisconsin, say, you'd have a better claim (but not a surefire one by any means ) against the production company because the theatres could claim that these other theatres were in competition due to their proximity to the American ones.<br>  <br>  But if these 475 theatres were, say in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, etc, there would be even less of a claim because the theatres couldn't realistically argue, "We're out money because people are flying/driving 1,000 miles with passports in hand to see that film.|`|ypVKuCDLaa	Yes but this is still a beach of the contract, and can stil be find.

Ta Da!|`|Sy5hK0mSaa	the problem is they keep throwing more and more weapons into the assault weapon category.  it used to be only full auto's were illegal, now it's just whatever looks scary.  it makes no sense to me, because highly powered sniper rifles can do an large amount of damage, whats a better crime then never being at the scene?  it's like they never did any research on it.|`|fEyuafVNaa	It makes bleeding heart liberals feel good about themselves and they send more money to the democrats.

What is the reason for them, then?  They are made for one reason - killing humans.  They are not used to hunt deer, birds or anything else.  They are created for war - killing humans.  Why does that need to be LEGAL??<br>  <br>  I think if one can JUSTIFY owning a gun - which hunters can do just that - then I am fine with it.  Even hand guns I am okay with.  I won't own one, but I see why someone would want to own one.

From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated----------------------------...<br>  Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.------------------------<br>  Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.------------------------------<br>  It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.The first year results are now in:<br>  List of 7 items:<br>  Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent<br>  Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent<br>  Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent)!In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent.<br>  Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!<br>  While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed.<br>  There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the ELDERLY.<br>  Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort, and expense was expended in successfully ridding Australian society of guns.<br>   The Australian experience and the other historical facts above prove it.<br>  You won't see this datum on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information.Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late! The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson.With guns, we are 'citizens'. Without them, we are 'subjects'.<br>  During WWII the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED!|`|dLVoWjwOaa	It is a direct violation and it won't do any good, just like it didn't the first f*cking time it was instated!

Bush senior banned certain guns then Clinton now comes another round, all in the name of making us safe yet crime increases.  Notice the relationship?|`|UXc6lMZBaa	avfc thinks that just because there's precedent, it's not unconstitutional. I wonder if he thinks that nothing unconstitutional has ever happened, ever?|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Yes, it's a violation of the second amendment. Taxing ammo is not, but banning assault weapons is. People seem to have forgotten that the Constitution was made to limit the power of the GOVERNMENT, not to limit the people. Because of the second amendment, criminals know that there's a possibility that if they attempt to rob someone, there's a chance that they could be armed.<br>  <br>  When law abiding citizens are guaranteed not to have guns, guess what happens. More robbery. People who want guns will get guns - or they'll get creative like they did in Britain, and begin using other weapons, such as knives.|`|VOZWgWgLaa	No it isn't. It's a justifiable restriction that will make things safer. Assault rifles are military grade weapons designed kill people rapidly and with relatively little effort.<br>  <br>  The average citizen should not be allowed to own such weapons. It would allow them to outgun police and basic law enforcement and could encourage a wave of extremely difficult to stop crime. The History Channel show, Shoutout, has an episode in which two criminals in Los Angeles armed with assault rifles and protected by military grade body armor held off  several uniformed police officers outside a Los Angeles bank. They didn't kill anyone, but several officers were badly wounded and needed medical attention, and they only fled the scene when it appeared that they were running out of ammunition and when SWAT arrived and they lost the advantage in the gun fight. We do not need to be turning our streets into the OK Coral.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The proposed "ban" is on assault rifles, not all guns. If they ban assault weapons you can still buy a handgun or a shotgun or a standard rifle. It's not going to disarm the country. And if a man owns an M-16 or AK-47 personally, I doubt he's a law abiding citizen.|`|atIb8ALhaa	Yes, it is an absolute usurpation of the constitution.  <br>  And as for you, shiroi, "An assault rifle is a weapon of war."  Yes, an assault rifle is a weapon of war, and we use it against a government in tyranny.  I will leave you with a quote that seems rather fitting to your stance.  May God damn your king Obama.<br>  <br>  "If ye love wealth better than liberty, the TRANQUILITY OF SERVITUDE better than the animated contest of freedom, go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen!” <br>  --Sam Adams|`|UnXCTJUkaa	The first assault weapons ban was unconstitutional, so this one isn't going to be any different.  <br>  <br>  According to official government sources (CDC.gov), the AWB and other gun control laws have not been shown to cause any decrease in gun related deaths or gun related crime.<br>  <br>  Every Fascist and Communist Government in history used Gun Control laws to suppress dissent, and some semi-democratic governments too.<br>  <br>  The Wiemar Republic enacted Gun Control in 1928. What happened? The Nazis easily took control. Hitler was initially despised by most of Germany in his early rise to power. Perhaps if the people had been armed, the Nazis would never have been.<br>  <br>  The Nazis extended the gun control laws in 1938.<br>  <br>  Gun Control Laws were enacted right before Government sponsored genocide was committed in every one of these countries:<br>  <br>  * Ottoman Turkey (1915-1917);<br>  * Soviet Russia (1929-1953);<br>  * Nazi Germany (1933-1945);<br>  * China (1949-1952, 1957-1960 and 1966-1976);<br>  * Guatemala (1961-1981);<br>  * Uganda (1971-1979);<br>  * Cambodia (1975-1979).<br>  <br>  Armed citizenry is absolutely necessary in a truly free society. Governments should always be afraid of the people they try to govern. Period.<br>  <br>  ///Maurice<br>  Obama is not going to be taking any of our guns.  He would have a full scale revolution on his hands if he tried.  Also, the Constitution is the highest law in the land.  Obama answers to the Constitution.

Every once in a while, one of the crazies gets loose.  Deal with.  No one is taking anyones guns.  Its not going to happen.  The previous ban did NOTHING to change crime rates in this country.  All it did was help to disarm law abiding citizens.  Gun sales exploded after Obama took office.  A huge portion of this country is pro gun.

Both recessions were caused by elements out of Clinton and Bush's control.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Plain and simple:  Tax cuts do not work to spur economic growth, especially when the cuts are heavily aimed at the wealthiest 1% of Americans.  They tend to save the extra dollars instead of spending.  However, the middle/working classes are more likely to use tax cuts for basic needs which in turn keeps the economy humming.  Finally, for a change, the middle/working classes will no longer be subsidizing the rich.  What a concept!|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Ok... so if cutting taxes is bad for the economy, why was it one of the centerpieces of the Obama campaign?

Cutting taxes to small business spurs growth, and cutting taxes on industry spurs expansion. <br>  <br>  It is pretty simple stuff.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bob K tell me you didn't do that math. 300K at 3% is 9K.

Therefore, they instituted QUOTAS for Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac so that they would make loans with $0 down or for people with so so credit history.  The mortgage companies, who relied on Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac (i.e. The GOLD standard) made loans to these people because Fannie & Freddie told them that these were "GOOD" loans.  The borrowers made poor decisions, the mortgage people were told that the rules have changed and followed them, Fannie & Freddie DID WHAT THEY WERE TOLD by the Clinton Administration.  Mortgage rates went up, and BANG, everything's jacked.<br>  <br>  Thanks Bill<br>  <br>  Side note:  NO ONE should EVER get a mortgage with less than 10% down.  Preferably 20%. This is the only PROVEN way to be sure that a borrower has enough financial sense to be a homeowner.  It's worked for hundreds of years and will not fail us if we could revert back to that system.|`|AA11787175	We have a problem, because Democrats required Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac to give loans to people who could not afford them.  Remember the "Housing Boom" When everyone and anyone was buying a house on an ARM loan?  <br>  It is factual that Republican Senators warned about Fanny and Freddie that eventually the Fry guy at Mc Donalds would not be able to afford the loan once the terms of the ARM were up.  (ARMS were mostly set at 3 years).  So if in 2002-2003 The peak of the bubble every one was moving in, well in 2006-2007 is when those ARM loans were expired.  Guess what?  The fry guy was still making $8.00 a hour and his $1500 mortgage, and his $200 car payment were out of reach.  So he kept the car and ran out on the house.<br>  <br>  The rich people still own their homes, problem now is they are cutting back on their "FUN" spending like movies, restaurants, travel, ect.... Which means someone is going home early tonight from the restaurant because there is less customers.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	If it were only so simple. The current economic conditions have been festering since the early nineties. The two previous administrations failed to make the needed policy adjustments. To 'blame Bush' or 'praise Clinton' shows that one does not have any understand of what has been occurring in the economy for over two decades.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	This economic mess was not caused by tax policy, but a shadow banking pyramid scam.  You should know this they talk about it every day on NPR.  The economy did boom under Bush until about 2006, but with this scam eating away in the background.  How is spending like a drunken sailer (yes I know Bush did it too) going to solve our debt problem??|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	Because tax cut don't work.

The bottom 50% of wage earners only pay 3% of the taxes. If you hardly pay any taxes, how can you expect a tax cut? That is called welfare. <br>  <br>  4) Cut spending on government programs.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	hmm,isn't that YOUR guy in there?

PELOSI, who is speaker of the house, won't allow anything from the Republicans to be considered. As speaker of the house she has that power.  And the Republican version actually created twice as many jobs and they were private sector jobs, instead of government jobs that the Pelosi solution had.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can do a little research before you make yourself look foolish next time.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Yes, they did.  However, the majority and House Speaker refused to even entertain their ideas.  Checks and Balances and fair negotiations seems to be a thing of the past.  According to the formula of Obama's own economists, the plan the Republicans wanted to present was half the cost that would double the creation of jobs.  You might do well to listen to both sides of the story rather than just one.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	they presented a plan.  perhaps you didn't hear the obama response?  "i won".  now who's refusing to reach across the aisle?  and perhaps they would have been less defensive of obama's "stimulus" bill if they had been able to actually read it.  nancy pelosi saw to it, by waving the usual required filing and review deadlines, that no one, and by no one i mean the republicans, got to read the bill.  let's be honest, chi, would you vote on something that you hadn't been given the chance to read?  wouldn't you expect your congressman to, at the very least, READ a bill of that magnitude before he voted in your stead?  and why do you think good ol' nancy saw to it that no one got to read it?  could it be that there were "projects" in there that were better left undisclosed?|`|wVik8Fo7aa	The GOP solution was, and always will be tax cuts to the wealthy (their base), massive deregulation, and utter incompetence.

After the Jindal speech...I had to laugh when one of the commentators scoffed about the health care plan that Jindal said the republican had...the commentator said they had none.  And if I remember McCain wanted to give the government money for health care for the people that would not begin to pay for ONE month and could be used for other purposes.  McCain and his merry band of misfits just failed to see the Health care industry is just like Wall Street.  CEOs walk away with more and more every year...and the premiums go up to pay for them.|`|4JiYP60laa	Yes they have. It is to reduce taxes which has worked historically, ie Reagan and Kennedy. Whereas flooding the economy with cash has failed historically in Nazi Germany and Saddam's Iraq, and many other situations.<br>  <br>  But Obama prefers to flood the economy with cash which means in 5 years you will need $50 to buy a bottle of baby formula. Give my best to the kids of the next generation. <br>  <br>  But don't fear Obama is a 1 termer.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Spending TWICE what the government bring in in revenue is NOT a solution but an unmitigated irresponsible disaster. There have been many other proposed solutions, not just from republicans, that the current administration and democratic controlled congress have dismissed outright without a second thought. Most likely because they didn't fit their political agenda.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	They're acting like willful little kids. NonononononoNO! They don't have a plan or an alternative. They're on the defensive, and everyone knows that when you back an animal into a corner, they get particularly vicious.<br>       They won't admit they had such a large part to play in the current mess, and trying to fob the blame off on the Dems.

That Jindal speech was so contrived and badly acted that anyone that takes that guy seriously deserves to have his trailer seized - on principle.<br>     The Republicans are digging themselves an ever-deeper hole, and blaming Obama, on principle. They don't want people to think about their part in creating the present mess.<br>      The only positive thing one can say about Republicans these days is that they have a great hairstylist - whoever it is should get a medal for making it look like there's far more than there really is.|`|QZicQ0kuaa	Sounds like a Democratic plan.

Here are a few surprising and disturbing things I found out about the death penalty system itself.   And looking at them doesn't mean I sympathize with criminals or want the worst of them on the streets ever again.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and for the worst of them, spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Once you realize these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|XsI7ISqsaa	the death penalty is a barbaric practice carried out by barbaric countries such as saudi arabia, iran and the US.<br>  <br>  eye for an eye is a disgusting attitude have. state sanctioned murder is still murder. killing someone will never bring anyone back and is an easy way out for a killer. sentences should be tougher and jails less comfortable<br>  <br>   life in prison should mean life in prison.|`|M3T4bosnaa	See this is why I am pro for the death penalty, if someone commits a crime so heinous that the death penalty is brought into the list of punishments then it should be used. You don't think you could try this on. A man breaks into a house and rapes and kills a 11 year old girl just for the simple fact he is a sick ****. Do you really want to pay for him to sit in jail for life and eat and watch cable tv and pretty much be catered to for everything. I sure the heck don't, do the crime be ready for the punishment. If the death penalty was used a little more often maybe criminal offenders would think twice before taking a life. I want my tax dollars going to something just and true not some killer who gets to sleep in and laze around watching tv all day.|`|ezQ44NqAaa	The fact is that 95% of the time that the State even bothers to seek the Death Penalty,they are open and shut cases.There are rare exceptions,but very few.So realistically if I were on the Jury,I would be dealing with a guilt so obvious it barely justifies a trial.And I would have no problem handing down that sentence.If you murder someone,you deserve to die,it's that simple.I personally wish they applied the death penalty to all 1st degree murder cases,every last one.<br>  <br>  And carrying it out isn't my job,but if they asked I would do it without hesitation.In my eyes killing a murderer is no more of a moral dilemma than shooting a rabid dog.<br>  <br>  On the subject of the Death Penalty I always say this,I only have two problems with the Death Penalty,it is not used often enough,or quickly enough.<br>  <br>  AD|`|AA10155521	Just think about it as if it was your family member or friend who someone, injured with intent ti kill or killed them??? remeber that everyone who is on death row has done just that, and the person or person who life they took had someone who loved them...thats i how feel personally...it just my opinion- PRO DEATH PENALTY!!!

You say that the arguments that actually work won't be taken seriously. Therefore, you're arguing with yourself. If we were to eliminate corporate taxes for all companies doing 100% US operations, the economy would right itself in about 5 minutes, and everybody would be hired on in about 10. We need to have ACTUAL discussions about what ACTUALLY works. Taxing the wealthy INDIVIDUALLY is what we ARE doing, and it's not working. I am not in favor of blindly cutting income taxes...yet. I want to see 2 quarters of positive growth first. Then, I'd go to the fair tax. We cannot spend our way to prosperity, because it's like standing in a bucket, and trying to lift yourself up by the handle, so says Winston Churchill. Investing in the future is great, but only if you're not two steps from collapse, as we ARE. My point is, unless we seriously consider the ideology of those we don't agree with, we are never going to find common ground. Food for thought.

AA10939092	I consider myself racist. I don't believe that any people have the right to invade my country en mass and then believe that they have the right to stay without going through the proper channels. My wife is a foreign national and she got here through legal channels. And that took about 4 months to get the temporary residency. Then we have to wait two years so she can get permanent residency. It's a long process and I resent the he ll out of people who circumvent the process so that those of us who take the right road have to pay more, go through more and go under more scrutiny. yeah..

Belive me they had their share of stones thrown at them from the local cave men. We can all be traced back to immigrants. This goverment is not going to do a damn thing about it. The can call them illegals, super illegals, felons or whatever they want and they will continue to pour into this country.

AA11209233	Red tape is the symbol for the hoops you have to jump through, the paperwork you have to fill out, and the things you have to do in order to get help from or business done with the federal bureaucracy.  Some people restrict the definition a little more--they would only call something red tape if it is actually a useless procedure.  <br>  <br>  It's a tough choice government (and business) always has to make.  You can decide that it isn't worth it for the government to spend so much time making records and tracking everything it spends money on, because it costs so much money to do that, and often stalls the individuals or companies trying to work with the government.  The problem is that if you cut out all the red tape, there is no way to track how it was spent and whether someone ripped of the government.  <br>  <br>  Just like with every business, the government has to decide how much time and money they want to waste to ensure that people who steal from them get caught.    People are usually most critical when the paperwork or red tape is useless and doesn't prove what it set out to do, or when it is impossible to get around.  Examples would be requiring a license that is not available (impossible), or one that anyone can have just by signing their name (useless).|`|He5XWnJtaa	Red tape is a term that's normally used to describe excessive formal rules of a bureaucracy that hinder getting things done or making decisions.|`|kl9tTmGLaa	Wasteful spending.

AA11206283	Punishment. – For a first conviction under subsection (a) or (d), or for a subsequent conviction for which the punishment is not specified by this subsection, the defendant shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. The term of imprisonment may be suspended only on condition that the defendant perform community service for a term of at least 24 hours. For a second offense committed within three years after the date the defendant was convicted of an offense under this section, the defendant shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. The term of imprisonment may be suspended only on condition that the defendant be imprisoned for a term of at least 72 hours as a condition of special probation, perform community service for a term of at least 72 hours, or both. For a third or subsequent offense committed within five years after the date the defendant was convicted of two other offenses under this section, the defendant shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The term of imprisonment may be suspended only if a condition of special probation is imposed to require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment of at least 11 days. However, if the sentencing judge finds that the defendant is unable, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, to perform the service required under this section, and the reasons for such findings are set forth in the judgment, the judge may pronounce such other sentence as the judge finds appropriate.<br>  <br>  (f)        Community Service Period. – If the judgment requires a defendant sentenced under this section to perform a specified number of hours of community service, the community service must be completed within:<br>  <br>  (1)       90 days, if the amount of community service required is 72 hours or more;<br>  <br>  (2)       60 days, if the amount of community service required is at least 48 hours but less than 72 hours; and<br>  <br>  (3)       30 days, if the amount of community service required is at least 24 hours but less than 48 hours.<br>  <br>  The court may extend these time limits upon motion of the defendant if it finds that the defendant has made a good faith effort to comply with the time limits specified in this subsection.

AA12212403	The hidden cost, if they end up back in the system is how much another trial will cost, you are correct.  I would approve of early release if there would be no trial and they would be thrown back in prison upon a repeat offense and that would be agreed upon up front by both parties.<br>  I sometimes don't think (for non violent crime) that prison isn't always the answer.<br>  I lead a group that helps the homeless and someone broke into the church where we store our supplies and stole from my group.  I have never felt so violated before, truly.  It was not me that was violated, it was the homeless that I help and work very hard for.  <br>  When the person was caught (yeah for justice!) I was asked by the court for some input on the sentence.  I gave it a great deal of thought.  I wanted this person to get counselling and be forced to serve time working in homeless shelters instead of in prison.  I felt prison would serve no purpose.  True understanding and learning only comes from empathizing with the homeless and their plight.  This person would ultimately serve those who they violated.  <br>  I got a thank you note from the person for my "mercy" and understanding.  My response was that I forgive them but I want to hear from them in five years to know they turned their life around.<br>  There has to be a better way that warehousing people they could be serving others.<br>  That is like if there was vehicular homicide case, a drunk driver.  What if that person were not in prison but forced to attend AA meetings and that a percent of their wages go to support the family of the person who was killed.  The family may have lost their breadwinner and have needs.  Interesting?<br>  <br>  <br>  Added note:  I don't think the remarks made about Michelle Obama were called for.  I don't approve of her husband's politics, but there is no need for that kind of remark.  That is the mentality that destroys what people think of us true conservatives.  I don't agree with BO or his wife's politics, but I'm not like that at all.|`|59b9f44cc97529e1ff460f8518e5b3f9aa	This is a tough one.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems is that our prisons are becoming overcrowded.

After they see how bad things are on the outside, they might even want to go back into the clink. lol|`|qai8pcnaaa	Well, a lot of the local governments are broke and don't want to continue to pay to keep criminals in jail.

He didn't have a real point - just one slogan that he BEAT into the viewers (Americans can do anything. . .).  Nothing more.  I didn't hear any points to ponder, merely a party trying to find a way again.<br>  <br>  Republicans need to get modern.  They are still in the past, reveling in Reagan's successes (the man is DEAD), and not getting with the future of things.  To survive they need to move forward - not stay with the past.  It isn't going to do anything for them.  And that is the honest truth.  Sorry this offends supporters of the GOP, but this is what I see as an outsider.

The GOP has to spin their failures at every chance but never offer real solutions except those of the deplorable Bush years.<br>  <br>  For those who blame Democrats, who won the majority in Congress in 2006; unfortunately, they did not have the seats in the Senate to prevent a Presidential (Bush veto), so the Republicans controlled every sector of government until Jan., 2009.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	actually conservatives are blaming republicans for this problem(and no you will not hear this on msnbc)<br>  but yes they are blaming republicans as well as i for this problem and you no what we deserve it because we are wrong on how we acted in the last 8 years and now are paying for it <br>  but i must say to all conservatives this is your chance to  become the majority , you deserve it|`|WTHTVJN6aa	No, a lack of personal responsibility on the part of people who took out mortgages they could not afford and the lenders who gave it to them are to blame for the current crisis. The problem is, he is making it worse and contributing to the crisis going forward.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	Much of the unemployment, is due towards companies looking over seas for employment.  This is roughly because of the high requirements, US individuals demand, in the work place.  Many of these companies just don't want to pay these benefits.  They can't afford to.  Ex... They would rather find an individual, who are qualified, to work, for them.  Rather paying extra, to teach another (who has the GED), the job. That's why you see many companies attracted towards asian, and european employments.  They have higher educational standards, in those parts of the world.<br>  <br>  Plus, (I know a few personaly), Many small companies, who  lost interest aswell.  Many are already losing customers, due to the economy.  While they have to teach an individual, with a GED to read and write.  It's one of the programs which companies and small buissnesses, have to enable their employees.  When it's school, that should have the task.  <br>  <br>  The average US individual, has a higher standard of living, which most companies, can't deal with. So they look internationaly.  If they can. Democrats are generaly the ones, who push these benifits, onto companies..... So what are you going to do, when your losing interest, from all of these benifits, and up graded standards, for your employees? You need to make interest some how.  The more people who don't buy, because they don't have no money.  the more people who are going to get laid off, or look for employment elsewear.  Just because the company is not making enough interest.  The cycle will get larger. Always feeding it's self.<br>  <br>  Just watch what happens, when Obama starts to add more standards, to benifit the average US employee.<br>  <br>  <br>  Carol... your a tool.  Please explain to me why the economy in most parts of the U.S is in economic trouble.  But some places like Fargo North Dakota, are blooming still.  Oh, I forgot.  These little towns, and cities, which are improving, are generaly made up of those individuals who are conservitive.  Maby if you save , rather than use all your life savings, buying the latest "blackberry". And buy more standard living products. You might have  some currency in your IRA.  Oh wait, your a die hard "give me, give me" Democrat.  Arn't you?|`|AA10604086	He will be able to get by a bit longer blaming President Bush. But sooner or later, people will be realizing HE is now the president and will be looking for results, not just talk.<br>  <br>  Also, don;t forget, things really did't start to go to hell until the Dems took control of congress about 2 years ago. And, don't forget, Mr Obama was a member of that same congress.|`|AA10138269	As an conservative, I do have common sense, unlike some who think that this happen all of a sudden, I know without a doubt that if President Obama was an all white liberal that he wouldn't be getting much Flack for this mess regardless whether it happen last year or now therefore he's not responsible nor was Bush.|`|fDuCamMraa	Well gee. Nobama has spent 1.6 Billion (yes Billion) dollars a day in new spending since his inauguration.  He has spent more money, and more time on Air Farce One, than any president in history.

No one political party is to blame. It is the failure of the elected officials as well as the Federal Reserve.<br>  <br>  So the responsibility falls entirely with the people. For it was they who voted the representatives into office and have failed to hold them accountable.<br>  <br>  The current administration in proving to be no different. Irresponsible spending, pointing fingers, party politics, nothing has changed.<br>  <br>  Time and time again your here people blaming Bush for this mess. The last administration did not help the situation, but can in no way be entirely to be at fault. <br>   It is that type of naive uninformed attitude that contributes to these troubles and shows that the speaker would rather buy in to the rhetoric than educate themselves on the issue and participate in a 'rational' solution. It also shows how uneducated they are on how the government and the economy works.|`|G2gnXH61aa	Obama and the Democrats. It goes way back to Jimmy Carter and the Community Reinvestment Act, affirmative action forced bank lending.  Carter made it law, Clinton expanded it, Democrats lied about it, Repbulicans tried to regulate it so it wouldn't explode like it did, Democrats blocked the regulation.  Obama worked and taught a key player in this whole mess, ACORN.  It was a generated crisis.<br>  <br>  Ignoranc:  Totally wrong.  If we had a dictator, yes.  But we have a government built around three branches of power.  Bush and McCain both tried to get regulation.  The Democrats who had power in Congress blocked it.|`|pezw43BMaa	I am not a conservative, but I feel the democrats carry a lot of responsibility for our current situation. Obama's policies are only going to make it worse. More companies are moving out of the united states because of his up coming huge tax hikes. Small companies are laying off and some are replacing employees with cheaper paid illegal workers. And his stimulus bill , (his parties stimulus bill )is crap.|`|9IHP4nA3aa	Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, as well as Bill Clinton were largely to blame. Clinton greatly expanded Carter's Community Reinvestment Act in 1995. This forced banks to provide risky mortgages to low income families. When Bush decided to regulate Freddie and Fannie in 2002, Frank and Dodd openly opposed this since "Bush was stopping poor people from getting homes".|`|WnDr1rFoaa	i believe he is responsible for spending 2 TRILLION in one month. we're focked. his budget plan for 2010 is over 3.5 TRILLION. it took dummy bush 8 years to spend 6 trillion. gibbs hinted last week we might be getting another stimulus by the end of summer to the tune of another trillion|`|oYaGeDewaa	the market contraction is what it is a necessary evil and it is solely no ones fault. now what i will say is since his election the dow had dropped around 7000 points which shows how investors are reacting to him|`|0jLL9GIsaa	No<br>  <br>  But the way the question is phrased makes presumptions,,so the whole thing is false.|`|Km0uJqdtaa	The democrats are the main problem|`|KfESe0ndaa	I'm blaming Clinton actually.

When you enlist, you know what you are getting.  If you don't want it, don't sign.<br>  <br>  There is a small subset of enlistments where this is not the case -- the X-ray MOS option (11X, 13X, 18X, etc).  You get to choose your branch, like 11-series Infantry, but the Army will decide if they want you in Anti-Armor, Mechanized, Light or Mortar Infantry.  Still, you picked your branch...you got pretty much exactly what you asked for.|`|SJHk9Omfaa	first off the MOS's you want must be available and secondly you must be qualified for that job/MOS. Officers are platoon leaders out of Officer candidate school/ROTC/or West Point as 2nd lt's. Its pretty much desk jockey jobs as you move up the Officer ranks. I was an US ARMY Recruiter in the 80's.|`|ZrbeUoR4aa	Not currently military, but officers are split into three main groups as far as work description. Company grade officers are those among the platoons in the field, 0-1 through 0-3. Field grade officers have an ironic name, as they do most of the delegation and paperwork. 04-06. General officers are of course large scale commanders.

You are not gauranteed anything except that you will be a soldier.<br>  <br>  As a soldier in any field you are a combat asset first.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to engage in combat or be exposed to warfare.... then stay out of the military.|`|K8qAniReaa	If you decide to waste your degree and enlist you can choose your MOS and you will be guaranteed that job.  If you become an officer you can go into the engineering branch and your job will be chosen for you.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	I'm not sure which service branches rotc  "college program" you are in from the details given. Didn't know there were colleges that offered a  BA in Civil Engineering rather than a BS.  If you are concerned with being deployed, you might check out  the Air Forces  TDSP:<br>  <br>  TDSP<br>  If you’re working on an engineering or meteorological degree, the Air Force Technical Degree Sponsorship Program (TDSP) can help you earn money while you finish your college education. Engineering and meteorological students within 24 months of graduation can enter the TDSP program. Each candidate must successfully meet and complete an evaluation by an Officer Training School (OTS) board. Once selected, each candidate receives an active-duty E-3 (Airman 1st Class) enlisted pay stipend while attending school. You’ll have peace of mind receiving a regular paycheck, so you can concentrate on your studies.

As you move up in rank they will move you around to different jobs. An officer is smart, flexible, and able to change when change is needed. With a BA, you should stay civilian if you like the field.|`|7idyT7Obaa	your not garunteed it unless you can somehow get it in writing in your contract. i think they only things were your garunteed a professional-style job in the military from civilian education are the medical positions (doctors, surgeons). might be a few others though, dont trust recruiters|`|AA11163314	If you are going to be a military officer in the Engineer branch then you are going to be a combat engineer.  You may have the opportunity to put your civil engineering skills to work on occasion - but you will be a military officer first and your mission will be combat engineering.<br>  <br>  There are some positions for civil engineers in Civil Affairs units - but these tend to be reserved for more senior officers with a track record.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	You are correct in that combat engineer and Corps of Engineer are totally different. You absolutely don't want combat engineers (no matter what degree you have). The Corps of Engineer is basically a desk bound professional career. Unfortunately there is no guarantee you'll get that. Anyone that says there is is lying.

Russia would have went to a stand still like korea|`|EJ8RZF7taa	From a Canadian standpoint maybe but there are several factors:<br>  <br>  1) Would the U.S. have joined the war if Canada and it's other allies were in DEEP trouble? Answer: most likely<br>  <br>  2) Canada was running dry on resources and man power so the fresh troops and resources from U.S. did help ALLOT. I'd go as far to say that "your" help was a key factor in winning the war, so thank you Americans :P<br>  <br>  3) Once U.S. joined the war Germany became completely demoralized because they knew that U.S. as stated above had fresh troops and resources. <br>  <br>  I'm nowhere close to be an expert but this is what I remembered learning in grade 10 history class so please no need to flame if I'm wrong :P|`|j7F8aFdGaa	I don't think so. I think it obviously would have helped but there was other things that lead to their collapse. Fighting a war on almost all sides and then pushing into russia in the middle of winter, not to mention hitlers health was deteriorating and he was almost always kept under a heavy stream of amphetamines from his doctor. Towards the end his decisions were getting worse and worse tactically towards the end. I think they would have over stretched themselves and lost anyways or hitler would have made a poor tactical decision and because of that leave to many opening to be taken down|`|H5Jrd0siaa	No but I think a truce would have ended up between Britain and Germany as The Germans failed to invade the UK at the Battle of Britain [Before USA joining allies]<br>  <br>  Russia however would have prob defeated Germany aned then prob moved on to take all of mainland europe.|`|7kuQdPo3aa	No. The main reason for Germany's defeat was Russia's involvement. Although the war would have been longer and more difficult, it is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which Russia would not have eventually won the war, or forced a peace treaty|`|IEDfqoFMaa	no, we would have had to join eventually, then we'd crush them. the nazis would be to big of threat to take over the U.S. so we would have to join it. if we didnt they would probably make it to the U.S. then wed have to join obviously|`|Ka0a0EnJaa	If flys had machine guns, frogs would be endangered. . . . . . . . . . . .

There is a very wide array of jobs that each branch offers and each branch will try to say they are the best to get you to join. Don't commit to a branch, do research on each branch that has the job you want, then sit down and ask yourself, with the training i get, where will i be in 20 yrs, with the training, and will i be able to use the training in a civilian job that pays good.

F5GyrdQfaa	"Stay The Course." <br>  <br>    Frankly, no politician wants to be seen as corrupting the morals of youth (as though that would be difficult!). At any rate, when 40% of prison inmates are drug offenders, and in prison it is estimated that they are net economic gains, whereas they were likely working at McDonald's before.<br>    A GAIN?!? you might ask. Yes. Each inmate adds ~$40,000 to the local economy from:<br>   jobs for the guards,<br>   food procurement,<br>   utilities, <br>  construction of facilities,<br>   lower-cost labor for manufacture of license plates and highway cleaning.<br>  PLUS--under Federal Statutes the entire property of a person convicted of drug felonies (the big-dogs, not general users) is seized and sold at auction...proceeds go to the Fed.<br>  So, if the US has ~2 million prisoners, 40% is about 800,000 in for drugs, adding a grand total of $32,000,000,000 (That's $32 Billion) per year of economic activity! <br>  <br>    Of course, one could also say that the illegality of drugs accounts for the insane violence in Mexico, as the cartels fight for control of a multi-billion dollar industry. So in a word...never!

Today, they are still running on fear and lies.  They have nothing so they are now the party of no and the party of whiners with no solution to any of the problems they created for this country.  They have no accountability, they offer no help to climb out of this economic mess and then they have the nerve to claim Obama's policies are class warfare when it was the rich that got all the tax breaks Bush gave out.  That party is on the way out because their time is up and was a hold over of the 19th century mindset.

LUosDsYaaa	The Navy currently has much higher bonuses. SRB is capped now at $90k, for each 4-year enlistment.<br>  <br>  During my 20 year career, my 'base pay' was usually about 1/4 of my paycheck. The other allowances are normally tax-free. So compared to a servicemember who only received base pay, all of their income might be taxable.<br>  <br>  However I served on subs, so I was tax-exempt anyway. None of my pay was taxed for 18 years of my career.<br>  <br>  In terms of comparing officer to enlisted, only the 'base pay' is more for an officer, enlisted men commonly get far more of the allowances. On my last 3 subs I made more as an E6 then my O4 Division Officer or my O5 Department head..<br>  <br>  I would be careful about any branch where you would be required to pay income taxes. Folks who pay taxes often pay 25% of their pay [or more]. Which is a HUGE chunk of your paycheck.<br>  <br>  I only got up to E6. My take home pay hovered around $65k / year [tax free].|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Taxes are based on income and whether or not you are married and what state you not on what branch you are in  So O1 that are single, from the same state get the same pay and same tax across the board.   For promotions it can depend on what you do, where you are stationed, etc.. on how quickly it will happen.|`|BphZi9yDaa	army promotes faster cuz its the largest, theres more room for promotion. as far as pay, everyone else already covered that, its the same for all, like same state, same rank, single- all make the same. you don't get bonuses as an officer b/c your base pay is so much higher.|`|9rEI0TnUaa	The Army is your best bet.  You will probably get about 100K in retention bonuses if you stay in for 10 years.  You will also get a alot of tax free pay when you are deployed.  Repeat after me - the Army needs Captains, the Army needs Captains ...|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	The branch that pays the most is:<br>  All pay the same..<br>  <br>  promotion is up to you... had hard you work for it and how many openings there are|`|K8qAniReaa	All branches pay the same for every rank.  Every branch pays the same taxes.  <br>  <br>  There are no officer bonuses just for getting commission.  It is expected that if someone is jumping through the hoops to become an officer it's because they want to be there. There are a few re-up bonuses but there's no way to tell what those will be by the time your contract as over because they change often for officers.  <br>  <br>  In 10 years you'll be halfway to retirement.  If you are really concerned with "financial support" when you're done with the military be prepared to do the whole 20.  At the end of that time the military will send you a pay check for the rest of your life.  Retirement pay is half the monthly pay an officer received for six months before retirement.  Yes, Army does have faster promotions so you'll reach that mark faster.  But since officer promotions are years longer than enlisted promotions it doesn't really matter which branch you join because if you're any good at being an officer the difference will only be a year or two so in the end it will even out.  That being said if you're not a good officer or the military downsizes in the next 20 years they'll kick you out so it won't matter.|`|2qFA5w2Naa	I've been told the air force. Officers make more vs. enlisted so if you have a college degree you should be set no matter which branch you go to.

I don't know if you know anything about it but under pressure and when heated (like when the building is on fire) it has the tendency to explode.

LX6AQ4kuaa	Unfortunately, they cannot get a visa unless they go through the consular process with the fee. You can't convince the US consulate, they either grant a visa or not and having a visa doesn't mean the person is allowed to enter the US cause upon entry, the border protection officials at the airport can deny them too. <br>  <br>  Are your cousins young, single, with no property owned in their country? Because it is no use applying for a tourist visa until these conditions change because they will be too suspicious since they don't have enough ties to their country.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	There's really nothing you can do.  US immigration law puts the burden of proof on them to convince the US embassy that they will not stay in the United States.  If they can't convince the embassy then they won't get a visa, sorry.

If you are 16 and have that, then Im sure that they could work out a deal.  I doubt if they would let you in the "real" army but they could put you in the DEP program until you are 17 and able to have a parent signature.  Talk to a recruiter for more details.|`|EJ8RZF7taa	I don't believe that any military in North America hires at that young of an age. In Canada (same for U.S. I believe) the military recruits at 17 years old WITH PARENT CONSENT and 18 without. Good luck.

That baby did not ask to be born, and now MUST be supported by someone.  I didn't make the baby, the guy who made it should take care of it, and maybe be neutered too, if he goes around making babies that he is not willing to take care of.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	It is not a matter of where you live - it is a matter of your being the father.<br>  <br>  You should be paying child support for your child regardless of where you live and where the child live and regardless of whether you or the child is a citizen.<br>  <br>  It is a PARENTAL duty, not an American duty alone.|`|bDoJuBEkaa	Funny everyone assumes your a man not wanting to support his child, when in fact your a mother.

And whoever said GED, dont, thats what i was aiming for before and my recruitment officer told me i couldn't. The marines accept almost nobody with GEDs and when they do you have to score huge on the ASVAB and dont get as good of an MOS. So as long as your schools accredited and you have a diploma you should be fine.|`|K8qAniReaa	Only if it's from an accredited school.

Was he seat belted at the time of the accident or not.  With no eye witnesses this would most likely not become a major issue.<br>  <br>  We must remember that the mother who was in control of the vehicle has lost her child.  Most of us would feel that the family has suffered enough for the unfortunate accident.  Having to live with the fact that something caused the accident in the first place, only the mother knows all of the true details and she will now have to live with this for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  The chances are that if all of the factors have been included in your original question, this will end as just being a very unfortunate accident.|`|m5CiESVdaa	I am pretty sure that most states (except MASS) have the Buckle Law.  In Mass, it is a "secondary" law, meaning, if you get stopped for something, and also do not have your belt on, you have trouble.

No,  you should not report it,  you should mind  your own business.|`|K8qAniReaa	Unless his actions are effecting unit cohesion or publicly reflecting poorly on the military there's nothing to report.

Unfortunately, if you do somehow talk to someone about it, she may get in trouble, it depends on what kind of company/unit she is in on how much.  An artical 15 with a demotion and lower pay sounds like as harsh as it could go.  If you do feel that she was taken advantage of and she feels the same way, you both should talk to her first line supervisor and work your way up.  If this guy is the man in charge (first seargent or even commander) you both could go to the IG to figure it out.

It was like a void that needed to be filled.  Many people were scared to fill that void because they thought they would end up like those that came before them... They thought they would end up dead.<br>  <br>  We've had a lot of good people working in the communities but nobody wanted to step up and take center stage.<br>  <br>  Now we have Barack Obama who is continuing King's legacy.

7HCcGlkxaa	1) A lot of people are telling her that cops need a warrant to get into her house. Is that true? And if it is true what should everyone at the party do?<br>  Depends, if she is calling the cops, then no. If they come because of a noise problem, and when they come they have a good reason to believe there is underage drinking, then they can go in.<br>  <br>  2) If the cops do come into the house, what will they do? Will they just kick everyone out or will they call your parents too?<br>  They will call your parents, and likely anyone who is drinking parents too because all will be arrested. If there is no drinking there are no worries. (unless there are other illegal activities)<br>  <br>  3) Is it better to stay inside the house, or run if the cops come?<br>  I would say run, but if you get caught you will get in more trouble.|`|wX0jcG6uaa	1 yes thats true. you dont have to open the door. everyone should stay inside.<br>  <br>  2 they will take everyones liscense plate who is there. and most likely sit and watch people come out to make sure people havent been drinking<br>  <br>  3 you are safe inside. stay inside, never ever run.  as long as u dont get a noise complaint or there are too many cars, cops may not even show up|`|NDkHAuniaa	the cops aren't going to come in the house unless they have a probably cause and if they don't, they'll need a warrent. also, the first time they show up, they'll give you a warning and the second time, they'll tell you to shut down the party. DO NOT RUN! whatever you do, tell them to calm down!|`|AA12205273	Cops do not need a warrant if they believe there is an illegal activity going on.<br>  If there is illegal activities going on they can arrest'.<br>  If you run and they catch you they'll add resisting arrest.|`|EJ8RZF7taa	Some of this depends slightly on the police officer(s) responding to the call. <br>  <br>  1) No they do not need a warrant if they suspect that there is underage drinking/"drug usage". Even if they did they could go to their cruiser and print one off for you in the matter of a minute.<br>  <br>  2) If the cops come in they will most likely fine everyone for underage drinking or something along those lines so yes mommies and daddies will find out!<br>  <br>  3) Stay because if you get caught (Murphy's Law says you probably will) you will be in a whole lot of trouble. <br>  <br>  As for the upperclassmen you probably will not be able to kick them out of the house as those jerks will do whatever the heck they want if no one short of the police or their parents show up to do something about it. <br>  Your best bet is to not have the party at all because something bad will most likely happen not to mention underage drinking is ILLEGAL but if you must have this party keep everyone inside, the music down, and exclusive to friends. Usually a police officer doesn't want to go through all the paper work to give everyone in a house party a ticket so keep it small to make police officers lives easier.

And I'm extremely grateful for your brother's sacrifice. <br>  I think those in the military give a whole lot of themselves. I wouldn't say they give "too much". My husband (who is in the military) would never say that he gives "too much" of himself. He might say he gives too much of our family time. But, all in all...he is very proud of what he does. We, as their families, sacrifice a whole lot as well. Most of my loved ones that are in the military feel worse about what their families & friends have to sacrifice rather than what they themselves give up. I mean...think about it. When someone decides to go into the military, everyone (with the exception of a spouse) around them doesn't sign papers "approving" of the decision. We don't always like it. We didn't sign up to send our friend and/or family member off to war. But, we still have to reap the consequences of that decision...whether we like it or not. So...yeah, my military family members & friends feel much worse about the sacrifices that their families & friends make than the ones they're making themselves. <br>  <br>  Again, I'm sorry for your loss. And I am eternally grateful for your brother's service.|`|jqwdoyC8aa	Im so sorry to hear of your loss, my heartfelt sympathies to your family, your brother was one of the elete of the bunch and you should be so proud of him.

Men like your brother and the men before him have all sufferd alot in there time in the service and they still suffer for the rest of there lives, The trauma they have seen and delt with at times gets the best of you, You dont come home with it not effecting you in some way or another, Be proud of who your brother was and be proud of the fact he did something that not many others (Civilians) would do for anyone. Kudos to your brother and his service,He is a Hero and deserves to be treated like one just like the rest of our troops past , presant and our future. Im a mom of 4 army and 1 navy and 1 marine.

AA11494150	If someone files a complaint, the police are obligated to investigate. Apparently the officer was willing to let it go initially because there was no complainant at the time. One came forward, so he decided to take action. <br>  <br>  Disorderly conduct can be anything that reasonably annoys someone else. Apparently someone was annoyed, because they called the police. <br>  <br>  Yes, there is a time limit. It is called the "Statute of Limitations". It varies depending on what state you are in, and the nature of the crime. I'm not aware of any states where the time limits are less than one year for a criminal act.
3yrpDNavaa	Maximum speed limitations usually means what's posted on the speed limit sign.  If the sign reads, "Speed limit 50" and you're doing 51, then you've exceeded the maximum speed limitation.<br>  <br>  Basic Rule Violation probably means the "basic speed rule," which is that you may not drive at a speed faster than what is safe under the conditions.  So, if it's a blizzard with zero visibility, and you're driving 45, then even if the speed limit is 50, you've still committed a basic rule violation, because 45 is way too fast for blizzard conditions.|`|7HCcGlkxaa	-Speed maximum is the speed limit itself<br>  <br>  -Speed limitations is the slowest you could go, <br>  <br>         Ex.

For example: Did you make racial remarks? Threaten them in any way? Joke about their sexuality (If they are gay or bisexual). There are factors but those are the major ones that come to mind. Although what you did may not be illegal you probably will get in trouble with the school. Also, a key factor is that this person assaulted you, so you will definitely want to bring this up to your lawyer if he does end up suing you.

He admitted it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't hold my breath.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	If he admitted it and plead guilty, that's it.|`|0f9b2dd98b1a2c306428892348a3ea68aa	You didn't give a great deal of information in this case, and I am NOT giving you specific legal advice.  I presume that your fiance has an attorney.  If he doesn't, then for specific legal advice, he needs to consult an attorney who specializes in federal criminal defense in your jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  In general, when one pleads guilty, the judge makes a series of findings.  This includes, (but is not an exhaustive list), that the person is pleading guilty voluntarily, and because they are indeed guilty.  He/she makes sure that the person understands that they are pleading guilty, they are not doing so because of some , and that there is indeed a basis for the guilty plea.. i.e there has to be some evidence that a crime was committed and that the defendant in fact committed the crime.<br>  <br>  If you are dealing with a conviction, then he has either already had a trial and was convicted at trial, or he pled guilty.  No way to know since you weren't specific.  Overturning a conviction, assuming that the trial court heard from witnesses and the judge or jury had an opportunity to determine their credibility, is incredibly difficult if there were no other difficulties in the trial.<br>  <br>  As I said earlier, if your fiancee doesn't already have a laywer, he will need to obtain counsel to have any hope of getting the specific legal questions answered.  For a referral, contact your local or state bar association.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Can't.<br>  In Federal Court, Juries are unlawfully instructed to judge ONLY the facts. They can't reason that there was no crime in the first place. They are told that if they believe the Prosecutor's story HAPPENED, the defendant is guilty.<br>  Federal Juries OFTEN "convict" defendants even when what they DID isn't illegal in the first place so don't hold your breath looking for a loophole.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Talk to his Lawyer is where you need to start.  But remember you better have a good case because 90% of people in prison claim their innocent.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	If he admitted to it and pled guilty there is no way out of it.  When you plead guilty the Judge asks you if you willingly plead guilty and explains to you the rights you are giving up by doing so.

Cuba, China in the early part of the last century, Tsar Russia, and France had revolutions, in part, because of a totally free market system.<br>  <br>  That is why all countries that have a capitalistic economic system (which is really all of them) have controls, because of the lessons of the past.  However, it is a fine line between too little control and too much.  Too little control results in accumulation of wealth and middle class stagnation, too much control results in economic stagnation.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Communist China is still Communist China.

It was when a caller on his radio show asked him about Bilderberg Group, and he said, "I don't know what you're talking about" in a way that said, 'Are you kidding me? I'm their spokesmouth!'

As illustrated by John Maynard Keyenes half a century ago, savings, and thus investment, is positively related to income.  The more you bring in, the more, proportionally you save and invest (or put in a bank, which loans or invests it).<br>  <br>  Thus, if you want to aply the gas pedal to the old 'economic engine' the thing to do is put more money in the hands of those with very high income, because a greater proportion of that money will be invested.<br>  <br>  The flaw with this paradiqm, wich worked reasonably well in the 80s and 90s, is that nothing obliges the very wealthy to invest /here/.  <br>  <br>  The same goes for demand side stimumlus, where you put more money in the hands of the poor in the theory that they'll spend it, increasing demand.  In the short run, that's inflationary, but in the long run, it can fuel economic growth, if there is capital available to ramp up production to meet the increased demand.  But, again, that demand can be met by imports as well as the local economy.<br>  <br>  In the last 'recovery,' Americans generally engaged in dis-savings, and bought a lot of cheap crap from China.  While economists measured the huge markup importers put on those goods as 'Domestic Product' (I kid you not), thus making it look like a recovery, Americans didn't really benefit from the easy-money policy.<br>  <br>  Today, the new administration is set to aply an old-fashioned demand-side economic stimulus, by taxing, borrowing, and, primarily, spending like crazy.  Again, the net result is likely to be economic stimulus benefiting Chinese companies and illegal aliens, more than Americans.<br>  <br>  You'd have to increase investment /in/ America to pull off a real recovery, and niether our political parties, nor corporate America apear to have any interest in doing that.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Right now it is the middle class hard working wage earners but the Government is trying to change that into the poor and uneducated so that no one will question the Government's authority.|`|b6fFgSNeaa	Small businesses|`|SQe5IUgtaa	According to obama rich people are like free cookies.

fDuCamMraa	To answer both of your questions with one answer, nobama basically either steals EVERYTHING or has someone else do it for him and he takes the credit, like the manager who talks with an employee and they tell him a really good idea. As soon as the employee leaves the manager picks up the phone and calls his boss and says "Hey boss, I just had this great idea" then repeats what his employee told him.<br>  <br>  Nobama doesn't write speeches, he delivers them.

Obama said he wanted to pull troops out of Iraq, and he's started trying to do that. He wanted to fix the economy, and he's made steps towards that. He said he wanted to give tax rebates back to middle class Americans, and he's tried to do that. <br>  <br>    You're being petty with your arguments about why you think his policies have changed. Obama made statements as to what he WANTED to achieve, then as things have changed, he's had to adapt. He'll never get everything he wants because he's not the only one who runs the show, there are lots of other politicians in Washington. <br>  <br>   I didn't vote for him, but I'm not a tool either.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	Personally, I don't give a damn what you believe.<br>  <br>  I voted for Obama cause he was the better candidate.<br>  <br>  The fact that he was able to clearly express his ideas, and not wander around like a senile old man looking for his lost dog, was a bonus.<br>  <br>  Who is "us" by the way?

I liked his idea on making health insurance affordable to all. My husband and I both work and we have great insurance, so while it isn't a benefit I need myself I am concerned with how many Americans can make it.<br>            McCain wanted to provide a $5000 tax credit for everyone so they could afford health insurance. With the average cost of decent private insurance for a family of 4 being over $1000 a month, that $5000 credit is not going to help anyone when they are having to pay that premium every month.<br>  <br>  2. I believe we need to start pulling out of Iraq and stepping it up in Afghanistan. Notice I didn't say get everyone the hell out of Iraq right this minute.<br>            McCain implied we needed to stay until we 'won'. Won what exactly?<br>  <br>  3. Call it ageism or whatever you want, but I do not feel like a 70+ year old man who owns 7 houses, dumped his wife to move on to a newer, richer, less injured woman, can really relate to many Americans. <br>  <br>  I actually didn't dislike McCain, I thought he was more middle of the road than I originally believed. I did however like Obamas ideas better. So I voted for who I wanted to vote for. My opinion may not be the same as yours, but that does not make it less valid.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	What are the numerous changes? Cite your source.  I voted for President Obama because it is time for someone to stand up for the average American and not spend their time representing big business and the wealthy in this country.

And not just something that had to be adjusted for the circumstances...<br>  <br>  If anyone believed that we were truly going to get completely out of Iraq, they were wrong and they didn't listen either.  He always said that we'd leave a small security force behind, and that any withdrawl would be based upon the conditions on the ground for the safety of our armed forces.  Which, by the way, is still his policy.<br>  <br>  I believe the rich should be taxed.  We have a huge deficit and we cannot fix it without taxing the rich.  When by the way did Obama say the rich shouldn't be taxed.  He always did.<br>  <br>  And the tax cuts for the middle class... that's on congress, it was originally $1000 per familly and is now $800.<br>  <br>  You really need to get your facts straight before you spout off stupidity.

This was the method the Obama camp used and well....once you teach a dog to fight based on reactions, it's hard to take back. A large portion of the people here live for partisan hatred.

2uiuOpSvaa	It depends on your state's expungement law and whether you were convicted or rather given some form of deferred imposition of sentence.  Disorderly conduct is a minor enough offense that under many circumstances in many states in can be completely removed from your record, but it depends on the state, how long ago it was, how old you were at the time, and what has happened since then.  In some states it depends whether it was some type of informal supervision or deferred conviction or an actual conviction.  Finally, it very often depends on the county and whether the judges and/or prosecutors are willing to allow expungments to go through even if they technically should not.<br>  <br>  All of which is to say: You will have to consult an attorney.  But the consultation is money well spend because it is a definite possibility.<br>  <br>  Here is the Pennsylvania statute of expungment: <a href="http://www.recordgone.com/statutes/18_Pennsylvania_Consolidated_Statutes_Annotated_9122.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.recordgone.com/statutes/18_Pe...</a><br>  <br>  You should still see an attorney, because they may be able to work with the statute to make it fit you even if it may not appear to at first blush.|`|6lyGn3kKaa	Hire a Criminal Attorney
jwIdq5qkaa	Get a good lawyer, you have just admitted you knew they were going to steal it, you gave him a ride, he spent the night with you. Obstruction of justice for not reporting it. You gave him a ride ACCESSORY/accomplice, you have had probation before so you can't get a prayer for justice. I'd go to the lawyer tell them everything. Maybe the judge won't be to hard on you, but I do see cases like this that come across the desk everyday. It is possible to have jail time.<br>  *edit*<br>  How can the mast say you probably won't go to jail? Its the judge that will choose that. A lot of people get jail time for Aiding and abetting.

You sound like a real winner|`|oyr13KYmaa	You knowingly helped a thief.  That makes you a thief, they should cut your hands off!|`|irxnnhnEaa	It is called aiding and abetting. You knowingly helped a crime be committed. If you are a minor, you will be sent to a juvenile prison until you are 18. If you are considered an adult (which I assume you are since you were driving), you can recieve as much as 2 years without probation for a first offense and 5 years if you have a record. <br>  <br>  North Carolina laws are pretty strict about those guidelines.|`|stEFmt1qaa	You can get up to one year in jail.  But, don't fret.  From what I can tell u are a minor if you were released without bond to your father.  If you have no priors and are not currently on probation or supervision you won't go to jail.  Definately shell out the four to five hundred dollars on a lawyer tho.  And expect community service and possibly a fine.  Possibly a fine, but definately community service if convicted.  If you don't want to pay for a lawyer, but I Strongly advise you to do so, you can talk to the States attorney, the lawyer for the courts trying to convict you, and tell him or her you would like to plead guilty and ask what punishment they would recommend for you.  They will typically give you a lesser punishment if you take this route, because it means they don't have to spend their time and effort to prove their case against you.  If you are happy w/ the terms the SA gives you, tell the SA you accept the terms and plead guilty and take the given punishment, probably 40-100 hrs of community service and about one year of supervision.  Good Luck.

He basically was on the campaign trail again doing the usual Bush Bashing.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Tell you what, if they are not wiped under the chair, she has to be eating it....|`|ONyvor2Taa	She did look like the Jolly Green Speaker...LOL|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Nope. I fell asleep halfway through the speech.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	no and I am glad I missed that|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Really?  I wasn't paying that close attention to the speech.<br>  <br>  I wonder if she "picked a winner"
0nZHAaQDaa	It was her anal retentiveness I think someone's head was stuck up there|`|d9L9C4dHaa	She had to keep standing up she kept farting that is why the smile on her face all the time or the bot ox.<br>  And Biden was getting drowsy and close to being knocked out by a few bad farts.<br>  <br>  I think Obama heard a few farts as he smiled pretty good at times.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	To much Ben-wah balls fun!|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I will guess yes, wee wee.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	First off, those TV cameras were pointed right towards her.  If Biden got up first she would lose the moment.  Second, what shows DEEP support for a left wing liberal than clapping on cue like a trained seal?  I think she would of wore one of those little cheerleader numbers if it wouldn't have resulted in a large percentage of Americans induced to vomitting.  Third, maybe she just doesn't have a clue how stupid she actually looked.  Oh, four more years of this foolishness.....|`|zeaoUpaQaa	Maybe nancy suffers from "restless leg syndrome".<br>  <br>  Would you prefer that she took a nap, like cheney did during bush's farewell speech?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.democracyforamerica.com/blog/042406_cheney.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.democracyforamerica.com/bl...</a>|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	She was wetting her seat.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Yes they were and it looked like she was interrupting Biden's nap..|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Lol... I thought she was just doing her calisthenics for the day|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	She is afraid that her melting rate will increase.  LOL<br>  <br>  DTG|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Look at her ! Could you miss that rude upstaging ,No, but may be she won't be to blame when forced to do her job! The woman is as big an imbarrassment to the softer gender as o is to his|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Wow...classy.<br>  <br>  I think she liked what she heard and that was why.|`|AA12279443	I think she was doing what everyone else was agreeing with him and like many of the others there wishing him the best.Of course we have you out there who do not agree with him making remarks about some thing that means nothing. I thought Vice President Biden was proud to be on that platform and wouldn't have cared how much he had to stand up|`|AA10818613	She was very funny but  at least her roids were where they are supposed to be.  Jindal's roids were obviously located in his mouth.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	She promised her hubby anal if a blk guy ever was elected President, somethings are better left unsaid.|`|2wyIOGi7aa	Because that Obama cult does all they can to glorify everything he says.... Never do they dare to question their Messiah....|`|lAuIxO1Jaa	because she is soooo proud......I guess, I dunno, maybe she didn't read her xanax prescription properly???|`|9AoUbpjJaa	Someone needs to tell her Obamas not God!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oLDeOuIWaa	Someone was tickling her with their pickle!|`|W8hvEmFlaa	I think she was sitting on her balls..|`|qTCo9QW2aa	She was just too much, haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Lol I keep saying that she saw a baby stroller in the back of the room and she was getting hungry and had to stand to get a better view.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	haha i know that was awkward! I was like wtf stop it its annoying|`|X9VDzvo4aa	Could have been that or it just could have been that she agreed with what the President was saying.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	She doesn't have the name Pee lotsy for nothing.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	Well at least she wasn't 'asleep at the wheel' ... she gives us value for money which is more than I can say for others I won't name for politeness sake ... you cons have enough worries already!
Wq8vQqvbaa	Home Prices are based on Supply and Demand.<br>  <br>  Right now there is a huge Supply in most areas, and very little Demand, therefore prices will more then likely continue to drop.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	It was government manipulation of the housing market that helped cause this mess in the first place. The government forced lenders to give loans to people that couldn’t afford the house in the first place that started this. Why would you want the government to have their hands in the supposed fix?|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Obama is going to try a little practice known as "Price Fixing".<br>  <br>  Carter tried it with gas.<br>  <br>  Some of us are old enough to remember how that worked out.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Probably not for a while.<br>  <br>  There are many factors influencing home prices.<br>  That is the ability of Americans to find jobs that allow them to afford housing and the supply of housing that is available.<br>  Right now there is an excess of home compared to buyers in many markets.<br>  It isn't that people don't want to own homes, they simply can't afford them anymore, because the reality of Reaganomics has set in.<br>  free trade realy didn't create more higher paying jobs.<br>  All it did was cause wages to fall and jobs to leave.<br>  <br>  Then you also have the credit default swaps and derivitives market that greatly influenced prices rising to levels they shouldn't have been at.<br>  <br>  This is the same thing the "drill here drill now" campaign would have resulted in, in the oil market.... price falling so much that production is no longer profitable.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	home prices go up only when there are plenty of buyers who are ready and willing and able to pay.  right now, id' say that is about zero for three, so prices will keep going down.|`|HZy629kLaa	No.  Whether government is involved or not home prices are not going to be going up soon.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	Let me get out my crystal ball....  No one knows when that will happen.  But I don't think we have hit bottom yet.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Home prices will not go up much any time in the near future...<br>  See, the problem is that what has happened lately is that home values have come down to what they should have already been... The values didn't decrease so much as they were over-valued for a long time...<br>  <br>  This stems from that fact that your mortgage is packaged with other mortgages and sold like stock on secondary markets. The more shares of these securities people buy, the more the property is worth. It is no different than the Dow Jones or the S&P, when mass selling takes place, the stock you own (and the company that issued it) is worth less.<br>  <br>  Really, the lending industry is really just a large Ponzzi scheme and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up! Get the government out of it!|`|iScNZJWSaa	I think they will go up eventually...but, we will never have such increases as we have had in the past....<br>  <br>  I hope people will act more responsibly...and more than likely, they will be forced to, because credit will be harder to come by.|`|XVxH0FFAaa	no, they will drop even further.|`|lAuIxO1Jaa	hope not....looking to buy one of these closuress!|`|P9RauQ7laa	no, they are going to keep going down.

YxfSmhOYaa	Hello Portorrique?a:<br>  <br>  The origin of the concept of the manifest destination(destiny) might go back for example up to the first colonists and farmers come from England and Scotland to the territory of what later they would be the United States. In the main they belonged to puritanical origin and Protestants.<br>  <br>  The puritanical minister of name John Cotton, was writing in 1630:<br>  <br>  No nation has the right to expel other one, if it(he,she) is not for a special plan of the sky like that they had the Israelites, until the native ones were acting unjustly with her(it). In this case they will have right to begin, legally, a war with them as well as to submit them.<br>  <br>  To be sent to origins of debates of territorial appropriation, as that it(he,she) postulates Cantino's Planisphere, it is possible to spread to the origins of the Target manifest term(end). There appears for the first time in the article Annexation of the journalist John L. O'Sullivan published in the magazine Democratic Review of New York, in the number of July - August, 1845. In him(it) it was said:<br>  <br>  The fulfillment of our manifest destination(destiny) is to spread over the whole continent that has been assigned to us by the Decision, for the development of the great experiment of freedom and self-government. It is a right as the one that has a tree of obtaining the air and the land necessary for the full <br>  <br>  Destination(Destiny) it is possible to estimate in the declaration of the president Theodore Roosevelt in his(her,your) annual message of 1904.<br>  <br>  If a nation demonstrates that it(he,she) can act with a reasonable efficiency and with the sense of the conveniences in social and political matter, if it(he,she) supports the order and respects his(her,your) obligations, it(he,she) does not have why to be afraid of an intervention of the United States. The chronic injustice or the importance that they ensue from a general relaxation of the rules Of a civilized society they can demand that, in consequence, in America or out of her(it), the intervention of a civilized nation and, in the western hemisphere, the adhesion of the United States to the Doctrine Monroe (based on the phrase " America for the Americans ") it(he,she) can force to the United States, though in opposition to his(her,your) desires, in flagrant cases of injustice or of impotence, to exercising a power of international policeman(police).<br>  <br>  Lamentable friend but it seems that Obama is not mas that a trojan horse.<br>  <br>  An embrace from Argentina|`|AA10774878	LOL!!! I would cut back on the caffine and work on your spelling.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	What ever you say*|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Since when have we had or needed a "rooster" in the White House?  I prefer an intelligent executive, which is what we have now.
nx7QtF0paa	The Federal Reserve prints all US currency and is NOT an entity of the government, but a cabal of private bankers formed in 1913 They "loan" the money to the government at an interest rate.  So We The People are charged  to use our own money basically.|`|twPZBsH2aa	You mean someone like Barney Frank, or VP Biden? They think all money belongs to the government.<br>  <br>  That's why they call a tax reduction an "expenditure" -- letting you keep your own money is considered an expense to these spend and tax liberals.<br>  <br>  Yes, they can take anything they want, and they're proving it.|`|h83BUzEQaa	The government doesn't have money, it's the people's money. It creates the paper but we create the value. The only way the government receives money is from tax payers and from that they just redistribute it into other programs...it's never actually theirs.
sLEdPDkHaa	no we have enough oil for 100+years stop being melodramatic of course some alternative energy is needed just as a back up like Bio diesel or solar power|`|zEVpA4WCaa	NONE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION .|`|67dWrrH9aa	Wrong, if we increase conservation, our economy will go into deflation. This is what's currently happening. That is why our gas prices are so low. [also due to supply and demand] When energy prices are deflating, that means our economy is hell. <br>  <br>  <br>  nuclear power? Do you know how much money it costs to build a nuclear plant? millions! It has also killed thousands of people because of radioactivity|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Drill baby drill.<br>  <br>  We got lots of oil and should tap it. The number one priority right now is the economy - and producing our own oil will help only be positive  in getting us out of the financial mess.<br>  <br>  If we didn't have politicians in Washington and a group of average citizens making decisions - we would be drilling tomorrow.|`|noo8vpvzaa	The gas prices are raising anyway...Wait until Obama adds the fuel tax to pay for all of his spending bills...Expect $4 a gallon again next year, if not more|`|6ade8f304e48ef25e16f2a4444611313aa	we do?<br>  and just exactly when?<br>  and who will know what the heck you are even talking about?|`|grdJOwuXaa	What's to disagree with?  The nuclear and drilling for more oil here parts.
A560oUeyaa	Cue the insults, the liberals hate it when you actually use facts. Their "Blame Bush" Mantra has to last until Obama is re elected. Notice how they just came up with a pork laden spending increase saying it is Bush's fault?|`|cMHxg372aa	"We had perfectly functional economy"<br>  <br>  BWAHAHAHAHA! Seriously? No, really? Borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia to speculate on real estate is a "perfectly functional economy?" Do you know anything about economics? Anything at all?<br>  <br>  "2006 when the liberals overtook the Congress"<br>  <br>  And what, PRECISELY, was it about the Dems' retaking congress that caused the "perfectly functional" fraudulent debt-bubble economy to collapse? From what I remember, they got little passed on account of their 1-vote majority and record-setting GOP fillibusters in the senate, and of what they did, Bush vetoed. Please tell me what SPECIFIC pieces of legislation caused this mess. If you can't produce SPECIFIC examples with explanations as to their effect, you should probably not be making such ridiculous claims.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	The markets dropped again the morning after his speech. So obviously he was not detailed enough or gave enough confidence.<br>  <br>  This is not an insult to Obama. It is an answer to your question.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Yes, but think of all the millions we are paying for the war each day.<br>  <br>  I though Obama said that the war deficit was not included in the stats previously also.
L6Ko87r9aa	Well, only if you're Indian, Asian, Spanish, et cetera. If you look European or African (whether you are one or not), I'm afraid I can't. Sorry, but if you're white or black, you're old news, and voting for you over the opposition would be racist. :(|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	if you don't look like jindal|`|CvFajKPUaa	now if you played basketball you would be perfect<br>  <br>  <br>  did you kill your ex-gay lover, did you marry the most racist witch to ever walk the Earth<br>  <br>  Do you have no business running so much as a hot dog stand<br>  <br>  If I were a ignorant cry baby who couldn't take care myself and wanted someone else to pay my way I think I might vote for you, that is as long as your not white!|`|R3p5gJZPaa	I think you'll probably win.  The preacher act is awfully seductive.  I know this is a play at Obama, so I will say that, yes, he probably looked like a better president than he will be.|`|KWa9vPVQaa	LOL you would have to be a true America, for God and country before you get my vote, and you would have to prvoe your honest!! as the day is long!!|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	No Sarah Palin we're not voting for you.<br>  <br>  P.S. Your terrible grammar and spelling gave you away.
eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Actually the trade deficit is solely the fault of oil imports.  We buy as much other crap from foreign countries as they do from us if it were not for the oil.  In this respect I agree with Obama.  Getting off of oil is one of our most important tasks.  The US does have large exports, mostly Hollywood movies, airplane parts, wheat.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Yes it can. We have to get rid of the Fed though. They're the cause of the business boom-bust cycle.
grdJOwuXaa	Nope.  Even if I disagree with them most of the time, it still doesn't make it right to lock them up or torture them.|`|lEaT5q06aa	how about utah, wyoming, idaho, montana<br>  <br>  i would be happy to leave you alone, but this is my country, and my ancestors were here many centuries before there was a USA<br>  <br>  better yet, how about we trade cuba for a state in the usa<br>  <br>  then we could go to club gitmo, and actually make cuba into something|`|KOF2lcydaa	Good trolling, but too make this a truly excellent piece of trolling you should have implied that Obama had a secret plan to round up his political opponents and critics.<br>  <br>  Excellent trolling enrages both side of an issue. For example, express support for public funding of Abortion, and then state how it will help cull the undesirables from our society. Bang! You have offended both conservatives and liberals.  As well as given them new ammo to throw at each other.<br>  <br>  The resulting Sh*t Storm creates "lulz" in abundance.<br>  <br>  I look forward to seeing your next attempt.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Thanks for proving my point - that you leftists fantasize about sending political opponents to gulag for torture and death. <br>  <br>  It's nice to finally see one of you honestly embrace your political forebear Stalin.<br>  <br>  --<br>  Thanks also for proving my point that leftists don't do critical thinking very well. Nobody said torture was Okay and the Geneva Conventions were not ignored.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	yeah, as long as we can send all the libs to Jersey, and make them eat crap seven days a week 4 times a day|`|1amF7oNwaa	IT JUST MIGHT BE A GREAT PLACE TO SEND THE LIBERALS TO.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	You could try but we have guns.|`|awdT7ZrCaa	Right, and you would do the same to them while you say its wrong to do it to people who are willing to kill children?<br>  <br>  I find it funny that so called "open-minded" Liberals are willing to defend murderers, but then want to lock up anyone with a different political view.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Okay, throw us all in Gitmo.  Then when al Qaida comes after your @sses, you'll have to fend for yourselves.<br>  <br>  (Hint - you're going to get SMOKED.)|`|8PCriC7Vaa	No more torture. it's called "enhanced interrogation". Imagine doing 6 yrs in prison for being in the wrong place.|`|AA10774878	I pray for the day that a Liberal tries to incarcerate me for my beliefs!!! You guys don't have the guts to try something so stupid!!!|`|BsQcplTQaa	Who would defend you from the terrorists you love so much?|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	No they work there now. They are the Guards and interpreters.|`|ejluOCdTaa	wrong|`|gau0w8LMaa	I am not hiding. <br>  <br>  My question is who would fund the government in that case?|`|qjptIgKZaa	Aren't liberals supposed to be supportive of freedom of speech, expression, and thought?  Usually it's conservatives that get accused of censorship.  <br>  <br>  On to the Gitmo issue.  You don't know what you're talking about.  <br>  The Geneva convention doesn't apply to terrorists.  They are not of a uniformed army representing a country.  <br>  <br>  Thanks for providing entertainment for us with your "intelligent" question.|`|Hjwyb3vgaa	Funny because the terrorists aren't protected by the Geneva. Aw its so bad we fake drown them and give them 5 hrs sleep while they chop us Marines heads off. If you try to take this Marine I'll not go down without a fight and I can hit a human target accurately from 500 yards away with my m16a2 service rifle. Have fun getting me.|`|h6LSiQovaa	The Geneva Convention doesn't apply to enemy combatants. Especially those who didn't even have on a military uniform. You might want to actually read the Geneva Convention protocol so you don't appear to just be another garden variety stupid asshole.|`|jRtQTN24aa	Go back to school nit wit. The Geneva Convention does not apply to non uniformed terrorists fighting under the banner of no nation  And neither do  they have our civil rights.|`|9VRwBeATaa	No human deserves to be treated like they have been over there. This is why I support sending conservatives over there.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	And who do you expect well do this for you The Conservative military or the Conservatives police or maybe the Yahoo mods ?|`|LCqL6Z2laa	Liberals should check out the new program.<br>  <br>  Adopt a Terrorist Program - it's for all you Liberals out there!|`|YustEeeFaa	Yes, this way all you liberals can kill the unborn and marry your pets.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Gitmo is for terrorists so jail the Libs|`|noo8vpvzaa	Then who would feed you?<br>  <br>  25% of your party can't feed the other 75%|`|oE0BpxPkaa	Start with Bush!|`|cWmx0J4jaa	question- who's going to write the paychecks of Libs?

Can you say Jindal's slogan in 2012??|`|S6XSLvjLaa	If his purpose was to get libs to be open minded and listen to what he has to say then yes.  It  was a waste of time.|`|EnODJeIcaa	No not really, because Barack and his spend happy cohorts in Congress tore through over a trillion dollars in their first month of office...And now the states (Not Just Republican Controlled...Tennessee's democrat Govenor is on board too) are saying that the Fed not only spent a TON of money irresponsibly, but for states to gain access to the money they have to make permanent changes to the way they do business as states to qualify for the money...<br>  <br>  It IS irresponsible it IS wasteful and it IS NOT going to do much of anything except advance the purpose of big government even more...They are talking about environmental issues and medicare reform being the backbone of our national recovery....do you even comprehend what that means?<br>  <br>  WE ARE GOING TO SAVE THE ECONOMY BY COWERING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LOBBYIST AND HANDCUFFING INDUSTRIES WITH CAP AND TRADE CARBON CREDITS AND NEW REGULATIONS....THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID IN 2006 TO THE AUTO INDUSTRY...THAT TURNED OUT GREAT DIDN'T IT.<br>  <br>  ENVIRONMENTALISM IS A GOOD THING...BUT OBAMA IS ADVANCING A LIBERAL AGENDA UNDER THE GUISE THAT IT IS THE ANSWER TO OUR LONG TERM FISCAL PROBLEMS...<br>  <br>  THE CONGRESS USED THE STIMULUS BILL AS A POWER GRAB BECAUSE THE STATES HAVE TO CONCEED TO THE FED TO GET THE MONEY AND CHANGE THE WAY THEY STRUCTURE PROGRAMS...ULTIMATELY GIVING WASHINGTON CONTROL OVER STATE RUN PROGRAMS....ONLY THE MONEY RUNS OUT NEXT YEAR...THE CHANGES TO POLICY ARE FOREVER....<br>  <br>  THEN HE ROLLS OUT A LIST OF LIBERAL'S FAVORITE PROGRAMS...ENVIRONMENTALISM....MORE MONEY FOR A OVERWIEGHT PIG OF AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T HOLD ANYONE ACCOUNTABLE....AND SOCIALIZED HEALTHCARE.....AND CALL IT OUR "ROAD TO RECOVERY"<br>  <br>  IT IS SO LUDICROUS AND I 0NLY WISH BOBBY HAD BEEN LESS CIVIL AND REALLY CALLED HIM OUT ON THE BULL$#!T HE'S PEDDLING.<br>  <br>  HE'S ADVANCING A SICK...BIG GOVERNMENT...SPECIAL INTEREST....POLICY STRUCTURE (PAID FOR BY YOU AND ME) AND CALLING IT HIS PLAN FOR AMERICA'S RESTORATION...<br>  <br>  THEY COUNT ON THE FACT THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THEIR WORDS AND DON'T DIG DEEPER...THEY COUNT ON PEOPLES IGNORANCE OF HOW THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN WORKS...THEY COUNT ON OUR STUPIDITY TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS CRAP.<br>  <br>  I FOR ONE AM GLAD THAT THEY HAD SOMEONE TELL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY AFTER THAT B.S. SESSION...I JUST WISH BOBBY HAD THROWN RESERVATION AWAY AND CALLED IT LIKE IT IS...|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	It was a waist of time on close minded Liberals. Americans that live in the real world where very interested in what he had to say and are looking forward to hearing more from him.  I know that people in the socialist states such as California or New York look at people from a great and sovereign state like Louisiana or Texas as strange and backward because we believe in ourselves and not the government.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Yes now that Obama has taken control he makes Republicans look even smarter, good point,<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	If you think so.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	I think it was pretty dumb to put him on right after the presidential address.  They could have given him a time slot on TV some other time.  He sounded like a joke compared to what Obama did only minutes earlier.  Kind of creepy also|`|AA11103371	Yes.  I have no idea what the republican party stands for.  <br>  <br>  "Americans can do anything"<br>  <br>  Yea.  Except get healthcare, find a job, get a decent education, etc|`|5hxWSezPaa	It must have been very worthwhile.  A lot of you guys on the left have tried to bash Jindal.

Obama rocks the house and the GOP sends out a young Mr Rogers looking guy who couldn't seem to speak his way out of a wet paper bag (in a suit that didn't fit) to respond.

I remember a woman in reno nevada, took out 12 people when she ran her car up on the sidewalk, why did they not ban cars?? this is a ruse for sure, and true to the book, that was taken off the shelves of America, they are doing it "without a shot fired"|`|zkzDLcznaa	Our gun rights are being assaulted from all angles!

So yes to answer your question.<br>  <br>  ______________________<br>  <br>  Here are examples from the SBA’s Table of Small Business Size Standards setting forth the maximum average annual receipts by industry that a business can have and still be classified as a small business:<br>  <br>  Crop production of all types — $750,000<br>  Animal production except for cattle & chicken/eggs — $750,000<br>  Cattle feedlots — $2.5M<br>  Chicken/egg production — $12.5M<br>  Forestry & logging — $7M<br>  Fishing — $4M<br>  Irrigation, sewage, water supplies — $7M<br>  Housing construction — $33.5M<br>  Heavy and civil engineering construction — $33.5M<br>  Dredging and cleanup — $20M<br>  Concrete, framing, and other housing contractors — $14M<br>  Car dealers — $23-29M<br>  RV, motorcycle, & boat dealers — $7M<br>  Furniture, hardware, clothing & sporting good stores — $7M<br>  Electronic stores — $9M<br>  Supermarkets, gas stations & department stores — $27M<br>  Pharmacies — $7M<br>  <br>  In addition, most of the industries in the Table — such as manufacturers of food, beverages, apparel, print, oil/gas, plastics, plumbing, machinery, computers, electronics, electrical, transportation, and furniture — are considered small businesses based on their total number of employees instead of average annual receipts. In those industries, the cut-off between small and large businesses ranges from 500-1,000 employees per business/industry.<br>  <br>  It’s difficult for me to imagine a business that has 50 or more employees (let alone 500-1,000) that has receipts of less than $250,000 per year. And, given the SBA definitions of “small business,” it seems likely that many small businesses in a wide range of industries have receipts of more than $250,000 per year.<br>  <br>  If so, it is appalling that Obama would imply that, if he is President, a small percentage of businesses exceed the $250,000 per year cut-off for increased taxation under his tax plan. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patterico.com/2008/10/07/obamas-tax-plan-and-small-businesses/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patterico.com/2008/10/07/obam...</a>|`|oVGOW3xPaa	$250,000 for a BUSINESS is tiny.  Businesses have to pay salaries, insurance, benefits, etc.  $250,000 for a single individual is doing alright, but for a business, you're basically a 2-man company.|`|uWZXR0gbaa	All you people who make more than 250,000<br>  stop complaining, if you don't like Obama's policies<br>  you can leave the country.<br>  I swear people b%*& too mcuh|`|SWkaGJpgaa	No, and nobody said or implied that. So, take down the stupid strawman.<br>  <br>  But the vast majority of jobs created by small businesses are in small businesses with revenues well over that number.<br>  <br>  Most small businesses with that level of income do not employ many people.<br>  <br>  Just thought you could use a clue. I have a lot of extra.|`|gau0w8LMaa	No not at all. We just want people to be aware that raising taxes on the rich includes many small businesses.|`|K4VZtIr3aa	if you make 250,000...your money should be taken from you and given to those who didn't earn it.<br>  <br>  And Obama is just the man to make it happen!<br>  <br>  Yes He Did!|`|tDZMJue9aa	umm no the question is do you|`|twPZBsH2aa	Huh?  How about rephrasing your question.<br>  <br>  Also, don't fall into the trap of believing that republicans make high incomes and democrats have low incomes. At least 1/2 of bankers are liberals, same for stock market hedge fund managers.<br>  <br>  Almost all of the hollywood highly paid actors, and producers are democrats, The Kennedy Family Foundation is very wealthy, so is John Kerry, and so is Jay Rockefeller.<br>  <br>  There is a common believe that "rich" means republican, it's just democrat talking points and is totally inaccurate.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Not at all. I owned a small business (restaurant) for over 15 years and never made over 75K profit in my best years. It took 7 years to make that amount. It did not happen overnight. <br>  <br>  However, when gas prices went up this past year, my food costs skyrocketed as the cost was passed down to me. So, what did I have to do? I had to raise my prices in a recession. Profits went down to the point where my wait staff was making more money than I was. (good for them!) It was no longer worth the risk, the hours or the anxiety, so I sold all my equipment and closed.<br>  <br>  When Obama raises taxes on business, it will affect most all small businesses that purchase products from outside vendors. Please don't kid yourself.<br>  <br>  BTW** I employed 20 people.|`|djmu98oUaa	In the past he was accused of speaking too fast and addressing people like he was giving a college lecture. He's had to alter that speech pattern to make himself understandable to the crowd.|`|40559ac88dd0ea7e2a8e896483eee069aa	Do democrats honestly think $ 250,000 a year is RICH?<br>  I live in Cali and I'm considered rich by Obama lmfao .<br>  $ 250k a year is middle class here.<br>  And i deserve to keep the money I earn to provide for MY family NOT yours!|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	It don't know. I do see people not understanding the difference between personal income and business income.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	They are very confused on what a "small" business is, after Bush gutted the SBA. ∠°)|`|MM8rqTMtaa	This is why you will always be a worker bee and never own a business.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Uhm no not at all. That sounds more like a Medium-Sized business. My small business will make about 150k a year..but after I'm done with costs, taxes, etc. I will probably get about 75k of it. I live in NYC though...anywhere else I would be making a ratio of 100k:50k. Still not bad money.

He5XWnJtaa	Absolutely not. The way to promote democracy is by being strong and prosperous ourselves, and setting an example that other people around the world will want to emulate. You can't do that by going around the world flexing imperial power and being the world's bully.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Democracy? If so, NO.<br>  <br>  America is a corporation (NOT a nation). America is a colony of England and is there to protect the bottom line. Obama is only protecting his shareholders. He will fight this war because it makes his shareholders money.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	For sure look what we did:|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	Promote what? If you're talking about goodwill then no it's a awful way to do it and a terrible waste of the lives of our military personnel. Our military might should only be used as the last option and then only if the entire population is willing to make the necessary sacrifices so the burden is not all placed only on the backs of our brave troops and their families like it has been in Iraq and Afghanistan.|`|879EON0taa	promote what?
nlj7sk5uaa	Because their stupid!|`|xSxqKF3Jaa	I am still waiting for a speech that actually identifies what "hope and change" he is going to bring. I am waiting for the facts not a non-fiction story he wants to give on Capitol Hill.|`|f1ecec25428774ecc93857a3b57ba395aa	He gave Hope and Change.<br>  <br>  I HOPE I have CHANGE in my pockets by the end of this year.|`|57fbb9da33f2c677b05957f815062f52aa	Obama is a bad joke on America.  His promises are as empty as his suit.|`|VMuZYfMwaa	Are you saying he didn't tell them he promises change? What?|`|f9crUDTwaa	What are you talking about ?|`|IHIiyyCTaa	What do you want him to tell you now ?...Get back to us if you can think of anything he hasn't told you yet, ok...|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Hitler summarizes it well:<br>  "The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force."|`|UHTcpdkVaa	To tell them what?

It's a huge relief to have someone in office who can actually speak!|`|FVDhYH6Baa	tell them what?<br>  <br>  and to give an answer: No
23e71794644d88340d4a6d39fc2c1cb2aa	Its hard to really estimate, as Al Qaeda  mostly plan, teach, and finance terrorist attacks, but they use smaller/less sophisticated extremist groups fighting for them.<br>  <br>  For example, most of the causalities in Afghanistan are Taliban forces, which are financed by Al Qaeda .<br>  <br>  Military casualties<br>  ~54,114 to 59,490+ dead|`|9rhmeb7raa	Latest figures I have for Operation Iraqi Freedom are through the month of September 2007. Link is below.|`|0ICrA2Nxaa	Not high enough.
ioCiw5zlaa	No. The rich will simply keep sending the money to overseas accounts vs allowing it to fall into the hands of us poor smucks.|`|AA11537652	No. Trickle down economics is a sham. It just a phrase some rich old bastard probably made up. He figured that if everything could funnel up to him and his buddies at the yacht club, then he could make up some junk like saying it will eventually trickle down to the poor. But then he bought a yacht with the money. The poor in the tent cities are still waiting for a cut of the money. But the old rich bastard is out fishing on his yacht. That's pretty much how it works. If you want a cut of the rich bastard's money, you gotta force him to trickle it down. He ain't gonna motivate himself to do it. He's having too much fun out on his yacht. Better yet, go and steal his yacht that he bought with your money.<br>  <br>  On a side note... NAFTA blows!|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	It worked for a short time when it was appropriate, but the other 99.999% of the time it is pretty much a complete failure.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	It worked great in the 80s and for most of the 00s but it does seem it worked better pre-NAFTA..|`|IFVrLCNOaa	I would say that trickle-down has nothing to do with NAFTA. Trade agreements are instituted to promote the earnings of business. Once the businesses are more profitable, Congress is duly rewarded with campaign contributions. Scratching each other's backs..<br>  <br>  NAFTA was ridiculous. It was penis envy over the EU. Mexico is a poor country. That's an undisputed fact. Of course, the poor can't buy enough product that is manufactured here. So, the production gets sent to Mexico and employs the Mexicans while the $$$ come back here vis a vis the producer and its executives get increased earnings from product sales at cheaper labor costs. This keeps the American retail and credit businesses going. So, we race to the bottom.<br>  <br>  The difference with the EU and NAFTA is the EU has a singular currency.|`|8c26428851da1c5fae2061ea4bfe5f60aa	Trickle-down econmics works, but it doesn't always trickle in the intended direction.<br>  <br>  Today, if you give investors scads of money, they'll likely use it to cover thier losses in real estate or derivatives, or invest it in China, neither of which helps Americans.<br>  <br>  NAFTA does make investment in our close neighbors more attractive, which hurts domestic investment to some degree, but aboloshing it would probably just lead to even more illegal immigration, and still wouldn't stop the flight of capital from America.|`|grdJOwuXaa	Both are terrible ideas.<br>  <br>  Trickle down economics has always, yes 100% of the time, been bad for the middle class.  <br>  <br>  NAFTA and CAFTA are pushing out the middle class jobs to other countries.|`|9npIzlHKaa	No.<br>  It never works in the long term.<br>  The outcome is always depression.... every time.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	it'd work fine if the government just stayed out of it.|`|T4C4r5sbaa	No.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	yes<br>  <br>  with NAFTA gone, there would be no more free trade zones nor exemptions.<br>  <br>  everything regardless of Country of Origin would be taxed at the rate of opur exports or higher... since they are high end high value tools or the whatever...|`|QZicQ0kuaa	Ben Franklin said no one ever lost money due to Trade.<br>  <br>  Funny how it Trickles when the Market is down. Were you better off when the Market was high?
2nRjy734aa	No. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2encXLmPDo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2encXLmP...</a><br>  <br>  And no to your second question. No one knows his background. Scary isn't it?|`|1HQavOGOaa	no, but he's always wanted to destroy the US|`|nkKtTopAaa	Well he might have wanted to go deeper into law. But i guess he couldn't have become a president if he hadn't dreamt about it.|`|fiBWZTyjaa	nope he wanted to be a firefighter|`|sQY0d3nTaa	idk but thankljghf
npXDrahzaa	Actually his budget proposed today will actually decrease charitable contributions by wealthy Americans.  The organizations that benefit the most from those contributions are top universities and research centers that do cancer research.  In other words, if his budget is approved it may actually reduce the money available for cancer research and keep us from finding a cure or new treatments for cancer!|`|SrO6TIWcaa	Well, JFK wasn't really a rocket scientist either.  I think you misunderstood of him taking credit for finding a "cure" for cancer (if that's even possible). I think the take-home message is that the government will be given more support for cancer research.  However, if you study cancer biology, you would realize that there are too many things that could go wrong that would lead to cancer and finding a "cure" is really, really close to impossible.  The best way to fight cancer is staying healthy.|`|7VP0ZJv1aa	he has never run anything larger than his mouth. the bailout should not have happened.|`|4T3YHHHZaa	he can cure cancer huh but not AIDS cry waaaaaaaaaah dont diss the prez fool|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I hope he gives enough money to research so a cure can be found.|`|aFC72tLZaa	If you listened real hard without your cell phone you would have heard exactly what he said.  I'll give you a clue, he's not a doctor or a scientist.|`|rephaDjLaa	That's not what he said. What he said is that "we can cure cancer in our time," meaning our lifetime.<br>  <br>  He supports government-supported research as opposed to just leaving it in the hands of the drug companies that have NO incentive to eliminate a disease that puts BILLIONS in their pockets every year.<br>  <br>  So, relax.|`|tIDNEwdMaa	As someone who works for the government, I can assure you that any program that is run by the government will be inefficient, ineffective, and outrageously expensive.<br>  <br>  I don't want any part of my healthcare to be supplied by the same government that gives us housing projects.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	Don't you critisize the President of the United States lady? What the heck is wrong with you? <br>  There should be laws about idiots like you! Show some respect!|`|0JL3Mg78aa	What???  Where is this located?  He is sending more money for cancer funding, I believe.  The government funds MOST cancer research, BTW.
8pt0fYPOaa	I see your reasoning - <br>  <br>  I wonder why - when a young girl disposes her newly born child in a trash can at school, why they have to hunt her down and haul her off to jail... funny? was it because she didn't pay an assasin [a doctor] to do the job for her?<br>  <br>  If we have 'the right to privacy' - then what law states that if I murder, abuse etc in the privacy of my home - why am I liable?<br>  <br>  Once an egg drops from the fallopian tube - it is no longer a part of 'her body' - once the egg becomes fertilized, we all know that life begins at conception - it wasn't her life, but the life of her new child - it can't be her body - If 'she' has the right to kill her child - and has the right to 'privacy' to do so - then why can't we apply the same rules to other people in other situations?<br>  <br>  Heck, my wife allows me to beat on her every weekend in the 'privacy' of our own home. What's wrong with that?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I am fine with you committing suicide. I don't think you should, but I also don't think our government should tell you that it is illegal. It's your body...do what you will. As for gay marriage, why are you trying to link that to murder?? It isn't your business because they aren't hurting anyone and because it is a civil compact between 2 consenting adults. Killing your wife--wherever you kill her--would be against the law...because she isn't your body and because she isn't consenting.|`|UKtZS3Wraa	wow youre taking it too far<br>  you can do anything, no ones stopping you, but the people are trying to make a point that its a woman's personal choice and she can do what she thinks will be best for herself and others. youre exaggerating this|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You have a point but it has nothing to do with the abortion issue. Read up about the history of what happend before abortion was legal. I remember a man on here told the story of coming home as a kid & seeing the women in the family & neighborhood sitting around the table in tears. He could hear them talking about what a nice girl she was. It ended up a girl they knew either performed an abortion on herself with a coat hanger or went to a back ally abortionist & bled to death. Believe me when you know what used to happen you would understand we commit murder when we don't give people a choice to see a Dr....I had a horrible childhood & my mother told me that if abortion was legal she would have aborted me. I wish she would have. I didn't know anyone here & believe God would have kept me which would have been fine or I could have had a mother who loved me. So maybe it is best for the child too.|`|dLVoWjwOaa	You had so many good points until your last sentence and then you just looked like an idiot.  If you are saying being pro-gay and pro-choice is the same as being pro-murder then you are officially the biggest idiot here tonight.|`|tvNkizDraa	First... nobody is stopping you from killing yourself.  If you fail, you'll be in trouble and if you succeed your insurance might not pay off.<br>  Second... sex between consenting adults has absolutely nothing to do with murder, a non-consensual act.|`|fCB7TTBCaa	You can kill yourself, lots of people do it. But don't, people like you. <br>  <br>  What most people, not just homosexuals, like to think is that your home is a place of privacy, so long as you don't interfere with someone else's life. Something like murder ya know, or beating your wife.<br>  <br>  And your last question completely lacks common sense. It isn't worth explaining to you.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Lol no one arrests you for trying to kill yourself. Theyll try to talk you out of it cause your stupid. but your not serving any jail time<br>  <br>  Please feel free to /wrists<br>  <br>  Murder is murder. Duh. do i REALLY have to go on this one?<br>  <br>  "and for homosexuals people say that its not our buisness of what people do in the privacy of there homes."<br>  <br>  Ahh so your ok if a brother and sister do, in the privacy of their home?|`|lyhnHhuWaa	why cant i kill myself? its my body i can do whatever i want with it right?<br>  You can kill yourself.  It's not like they're going to put you in jail for it.<br>  <br>  so if i murdered my wife in the privacy of my house would that be considered ok?<br>  No, that would be considered murder.|`|90KCAgoAaa	Comparing having a homosexual relationship in your own home with murdering someone in your home is absolutely ridiculous. How on earth do you view two men having consensual sex in their own home with you murdering your wife ANYWHERE? <br>  <br>  Did that 'comparison' actually make sense to you when you typed it out?|`|5rL4njnxaa	This is a stupid question.<br>  <br>  Murder is not the same as gay sex.  I suggest you rent some gay porn and a few slasher movies watch them and take notes on the difference.<br>  <br>  As far as the abortion goes- I am fine with you killing yourself if you wish.  I don't think it should be illegal.  But if you do it anyway and succeed, I promise no jail time.|`|9npIzlHKaa	You can kill yourself.<br>  Ultimately no one can stop you.<br>  <br>  Murdering your wife in privacy is still murder.<br>  And from this blog you wrote it will now be 1st degree murder.|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	You can kill yourself, it's your choice, killing anyone else regardless of who or where is a no no.  If you can't see the difference here then I can't help you.|`|67dWrrH9aa	Wow... are you poor? because your making no sense.<br>  <br>  You can kill yourself. Nobody's stopping you. It's just if you FAIL at killing yourself, then your in trouble.|`|V9d3qnUiaa	I think the problem is in defining what is consensual. Killing your wife is illegal, because we'll never know if she said "honey, I want to die today, so can you do it for me?" However, we do know that homosexuals are in a consensual relationship (hopefully), and like any other relationship - the couple has a right to make their own decisions free from outside interference. <br>  <br>  So...you can kill yourself. I wish you wouldn't, but you can. As for abortion, I sort of equal the decision making to life support. Someone in the situation of life support has to make the decision of pulling the plug. For me, the mother has the right to make that choice in the case of abortion - the government needs to stay away from her decision.<br>  <br>  I am pro gay marriage, and pro abortion with restrictions. I don't like the idea of women having one abortion after the other. I prefer prevention, but I also don't believe that the option of abortion should be kicked out altogether. <br>  <br>  LM|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	If you kill your self, what can anyone do about it? Sounds like an unenforceable law.<br>  <br>  You omit the key word of "Consenting" people do what they want in the privacy of their home. Includes more than homosexuals, it includes things like you having sex with your wife.<br>  <br>  Will your wife "consent" to you murdering her? If she does, then it isn't a murder, it is assisted suicide. Legal in some states.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you need to give your arguments some substance.|`|grdJOwuXaa	Your right, if I can shoot a gun at a paper target, maybe I should be allowed to shoot it in a church.  (obviously sarcasm) <br>  <br>  The reason you can't kill yourself is most to do with insurance laws, so that they don't have to pay off your policy.<br>  <br>  As to the homosexual/murder thing, wow that isn't even close to being in the same arena much less the same game.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	I think common sense tells you the difference between the two.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	I am pro-gay marriage and pro-abortion!!!<br>  <br>  OBAMA 2012!!!

KDOIKIq2aa	The only place I know that has a private police force is the Police Specials of San Fransisco.  They bought a area of the city to patrol and then charge the people living and working in the area for their pay check.  Basically a legal form of a protection rack.<br>  <br>  We currently have school police, but they are still paid for with public (tax) money.|`|6Gfz125Paa	There are private security companies that provide law enforcement services to certain areas, such as large corporate and university campuses, special events, and sometimes even individual neighborhoods. For example, many rich neighborhoods in Los Angeles hire their own private patrol to supplement the understaffed LAPD.|`|AA10163820	Law enforcement agencies typically derive their authority from the state so by definition, the answer is no.  <br>  <br>  There are lots of "private police" and security companies, but I don't know of any of them that have the same enforcement authority as a government-run law enforcement agency.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	Depending on the State, yes.  North Carolina law allows for private police, known as "Company Police."  These are fully-trained and certified police officers, who work for a for-profit company, which in most cases contracts them out to a client.  Once on the client property, they are fully-empowered, though they return to normal 'civilian' status, when off client property, unless they are in a pursuit, which started on that property.<br>  <br>  ** edit **<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/Statutes/StatutesTOC.pl?bPrintable=true&Chapter=0074E" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/St...</a><br>  <br>  Each line is a link.|`|e40fcd4f29d731a47792529a58f3c4c8aa	Wackenhut is one such company.

Yi0sksmJaa	I think the US is the only country left with completely privatized health care. Switzerland has a nationally mandated health care and if you meet certain criteria you get health care from either the federal government or the cantons (think state). Check out the link I've attached. I think it's about an hour long and goes over various forms of national health insurance by many countries.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	if you consider China developed than China and us. Of course China's actual health care is among the worst on the planet depending on which economic sector you're in. China no longer has national health care. they abandoned that with the cultural revolution, but kept the communist in power. If you're a Falun Gong practitioner China will simply steal your internal organs and resell them to people with money. The Falun Gong victims have their bodies burned to destroy the evidence. It also pays for a large part of their military spending, stealing body organs, sell on the FREE MARKET and kill the victims.<br>  Leave it up to free marketers. Solve the health care problem by selling poor peoples bodily organs to the rich.|`|ywOqliwKaa	It is not so important whether or not we have socialized medicine. It is important we have good health care. <br>  <br>  I have been in the socialized health care systems in Mexico, Japan, and England. I have good friends from Canada.<br>  <br>  What you will find is socialized systems provide basic decent care, except for a lot of specialized equipment and doctors which are not as available to every one. It will be fine for the people that do not have insurance, but many (if not most) americans will not like socialized medical. It will be interesting to watch. <br>  <br>  We will probably end up with a system like they have in Mexico and Japan. It is a dual system - Private and public. Those that can afford it use the private system at least for more serious illness.|`|90tPT5nlaa	I believe the US is the only one.|`|twPZBsH2aa	And the healthcare in those countries drives citizens to come to the USA for adequate and advanced treatments.<br>  <br>  Obama will assure that we have marginal healthcare, few new drugs (since he despises investors and capitalism that is needed to take the risk of developing new drugs).<br>  <br>  We've seen the best of the USA. It's over. Welcome to Europe, higher unemployment, lower standard of living, and socialism.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that today's youth will never know what it was like when America was a great place, lots of opportunity, lots of freedom, and lots of hope.  Look at the Reagan years, after the depressing Jimmy Carter administration.<br>  <br>  At this point, the Obama programs are being put in place that won't go away, they are becoming a permanent part of our system, and with that, who wants to be a doctor?<br>  <br>  In England, they have lots of female Muslim doctors who won't wash their arms up to their elbows before surgical procedures because it's against their religion.

uMnlVZ8oaa	I definitely agree with you. I have been in discussions about this exact question. I believe that Liberals have helped the Republicans make this nation turn against everything that the constitution stands for, and perpetuate poverty, crime, and drug abuse. However, most would disagree with me on that, but Liberals hide their true ideals/intentions behind a charade of equality. In reality most Liberals are for equality when it comes to females who meet their standards and are against equality among minorities, such as African-Americans and Latinos. For example, in colleges white females receive better grades on average than minorities. In addition, have you ever noticed that all of the outreach programs that are supposed to help those who live in the inner cities or "ghettos" (made up of primarily African-Americans and Latinos) don't work? These types of programs are created and ran by Liberals. I think that it will probably take someone like Martin Luther King to capture peoples attention and create a revolution, which I think desperately needs to happen. However, I think that Liberals and Republicans alike have made this possibility of a revolution more unlikely to happen by making the inner city school systems horrid, they barely teach these kids anything, most graduate with a sixth grade education at best (google it, there are documentaries about it). They have also put shows on television that encourage and perpetuate the idea that being dumb is "cool". Back in the 50's to 70's this was not the case, not just anybody was allowed to become a teacher like now. The decay of America's youth started in the 80's with Reagan/Reaganomics, when crack was introduced into the ghettos. Since then the rich keep getting richer while the poor get poorer, and the elite do everything in their power to keep it that way (the elite includes some people of government). But, like I said earlier I believe there should and eventually will be a revolution.|`|AA11895162	From what I hear there are going to be 'Boston tea parties' starting up this weekend.

qwaWd14vaa	You can not be charged with the same crime twice as this is called Double Jeopardy.<br>  But she may have dropped the charge which is illegal, in a domestic violence case because the prosecution for the state, is now almost demanded to file a domestic or child abuse case, even if the complaining party drops the case?|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	If you rob someone's house and they drop the charges and you rob them again - do you think you can't be charged with robbery a second time?<br>  <br>  Double jeopardy protects you from being tried for the same crime more than once. But if she presses new charges, then it is considered part of a crime seperate from the first time she pressed charges. In otherwords the new charge for domestic abuse will be counted as part of a crime seperate from the first.<br>  <br>  Now she cannot "undo" the fact that she dropped the first charges. That would be double jeopardy.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	No, double jeopardy protects you.  It is in the constitution.|`|d744df703c1bbfc38519fcf12e361265aa	Wow.. this needs some clarification.<br>  <br>  1.  Double Jeopardy only applies once the jury is seated and the trial begins.  At that point, the DA has just the one opportunity to present their evidence.  So... if it didn't get to that point, the DA could file a second criminal complaint on the same behavior.<br>  <br>  2.  People don't press charges.  People file police reports.  The Prosecuting Attorney files charges, using a criminal complaint, in Court.  If a victim of Domestic Violence says they don't want to press charges, the DA doesn't usually withdraw the complaint, not unless the entire case was based on the victim's testimony.  In that case, if the vicim backed out, the DA couldn't present their evidence.  If that's what happened, she could go back to the DA and they'd take a second look at the case.|`|AA11758925	well you can say double jeopardy but that is for only when you are tried in court, meaning you can't be tried again. I doubt a officer or the d.a. office would accept the case because she declined the first time and changed her mind. You are good but no more domestic abuse, LEARN|`|zejFr1Ciaa	Not for the same crime, but if you abused her again you bet she can and I might add should.|`|GqJVk2kYaa	YES SHE CAN.  You were never tried for the charge.  I was charged with DWI which was dismissed by the DA.  I cannot have the charge expunged for 5 years because the DA has 5 years before they can no longer refile the charges against me as I was not proven "not guilty".  You were never proven "not guilty" so it would not be considered double jeopardy.  Double Jeopardy only applies if you went to trial and were proven not guilty by a jury or a judge.  In your case the charges were dropped before it reached that point.  In this case the DA's office still reserves the right to refile against you though it is unlikely they will given the fact that she is flip flopping.  Your attorney would have a field day questioning her and the DA would would be cautious before refiling agianst you given the fact that she already dropped the charges/|`|9VRwBeATaa	Yes. Since you were never tried for the charge it is NOT considered Double Jeopardy. <br>  <br>  It's very unlikely however that you will be charged for the same offence after having them dropped. Unless of course there is new information involved that indicate it's a different instance from the one you were previously charged for.|`|FAlZFYwnaa	She can press charges on you, but it has to be for a different crime.  You can't be charged with the same exact crime twice.|`|4ebc77c40a928c3dfe982bb0cb330b18aa	No. You are protected by a part of the Constitution that says one may not be tried twice for the same crime (this is known as Double Jeopardy).|`|vO1mAKljaa	No she cannot, once she drops charges, she cannot try & press those charges on you again, once dropped, they are DROPPED.|`|xx5Rp91Laa	nothing to do with double jeopardy, hes an idiot... but its still NO anyways sorry, it probably happen again anyways tho|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	No

AA11248330	It's amazing how right-wing trolls and their hosts love to pontificate, isn't it? Unfortunately for them, they only prove my points. One of them offers: "...MSNBC, CNN are losing their audience in greater numbers, while Fox, Hannity or Rush Limbaugh numbers are increasing. ..." Unfortunately, the argument is not only lacking in facts, but illustrates why the Fairness Doctrine is important. For instance, Fox "News" ranted on, as did Rush and Ken doll Sean, about WMDs in Iraq, as well as every other lie put forth by the Bush administration, reaching millions of listeners and viewers, while also slandering the U.N. weapons inspectors, who just happened to be right. If you add political Christian broadcasting to this toxic mix, you get a monopoly that is dangerous. Progressives didn't get on Armed Forces radio until late in 2005, but even then Ed Schultz was threatened with cancellation before he even debuted, because he criticized someone in the Bush administration. This isn't championing free speech. It is patently unfair practice. It also illustrates the tilted news our military is getting. That, too, is dangerous. <br>  <br>  Right-wing radio offers propaganda, not facts, with the intent to play on the listeners emotions, without offering content that is based in reality. The ratings prove that FNC, Fox "News" channel is losing out in the ratings. In addition, the ignorance of conservatives about media and radio is further shown when they say the Fairness Doctrine is about "...demanding that the government implement further control or regulation over an entire industry, it might be simpler to look in the mirror, at the rating points & ad revenues & realize that the market for the “progressive” or liberal slant isn’t as popular or pervasive as you assume it to be. ... Again, they miss the point. Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, as well as the leader in progressive talk, Randi Rhodes, are making it in the commercial market. They are not only popular, but growing. The issue is to allow more progressive hosts on local am/fm radio to see if we can also make it. Unless you've been in the battle for radio you don't know what it's like, with conservative corporations not even giving progressives a chance to get on air, or cancelling good hosts before they have the time to prove themselves. You have to give progressive hosts a chance to build an audience, which takes time. But conservatives do not want fairness, which can be seen through their trade policy, as well as their anti-union rhetoric, which has decimated the middle class, by selling out workers for outsourcing all in the name of profit. They want a one-way talking machine on radio, paid by and benefiting only their political partners in business, as well. <br>  Right-wing is on the air and getting advertisers because they're the only game in town, except for a few progressive hosts like Schultz, Miller and Rhodes. The Fairness Doctrine will not keep a bad show on, but it will allow entry to good hosts who are now being shut out by conservative conglomerates<br>  The short version of the Fairness Doctrine is that in 1987 Reagan had it scuttled. Shortly after that Rush Limbaugh began his journey and right-wing radio was created and gradually took over the airwaves, with the help of their corporate friends. The Fairness Doctrine could really make a difference. Why do you think conservatives are screaming like crazy?|`|AA10691319	The reason it's bad is because the government is stepping in and telling private media companies what they have to air/print.<br>  <br>  Example:  if you started your own media network and dedicated it to news.  you start a tv station, a news paper, and a website.  Currently you would have the right to decide what political bais(if any) your reports have.  If the fairness doctrine came into effect, the government would force you to present each political bais for an equil amount of time, taking away your freedom to decide what message you present, or you would lose your media license.|`|AA12109395	The Fairness Doctrine was established by the Federal Communications Commission requiring the holder of broadcast licenses to present controversial issues of public importance in an honest, equitable, and balanced manner.<br>  <br>  It squashes rendering an opionion on controversial and thought-provoking issues and subjects without presenting opposing views.|`|NCq71qptaa	The fairness doctrine will require any media outlet - radio, tv, etc. - to give the opposing view as well as their own.  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Problem is the way it's implemented, <br>  <br>  Most of the media outlets - tv and newspapers - have a generally left-leaning point of view.  The only place to hear right-leaning views is talk radio.  The left tried it, but no one listened.<br>  <br>  The doctrine will make the stations provide the opposing point of view, even if no one wants to listen or sponsor it.  If they don't, they can be sued.  Since it doesn't take much to take a case to court and force someone to spend a lot of money defending themselves, or to mobilize a bunch of noisy people to make it look like there's a problem, many sponsors will pull out to prevent being sued or boycotted.<br>  <br>  The stations, since they don't want to be sued or lose all their sponsors, will switch to a different format - like boring music - to keep their insurance down and their companies out of court.<br>  <br>  So, regardless of the fact that they were NOT intended, the end results would be the loss of any outlet for discussion of anything that could possibly be seen as controversial or thought-provoking.<br>  <br>  Basically, everything will become plain vanilla and there will be no chance to hear anyone else's opinion.|`|fLQSULeDaa	TOM:<br>             It was defeated by the Republicans, its mainly another view about the Television or Radio talking heads, like Limbaugh or all the crappy shows like Fox News, of which is purely a Republican platform<br>  for distortion & deception of their criminal organization, oops their lying party. Something like the Bush & Wall street crew.<br>             It infringes on freedom of speech, --- yeah right, another<br>  victory for hiding righteousnes & truth.
9VRwBeATaa	How can you be so certain of his innocence? I understand you may trust him, but not everyone is who they claim to be. Trust me, I've had experience with people who I thought were friends.<br>  <br>  1.) I assume he was released on bail. The bail always comes with conditions that must be followed. He is the only one having his activities limited because he's the accused, not the victim....<br>  <br>  2.) Hiring a good lawyer. If there is strong evidence against him, the best a lawyer can do is have the charge lessened down.<br>  <br>  3.) If he really is innocent, I wish him luck in fighting this!|`|qGh1HhPwaa	1) Why would he want to go there anyway???<br>  2) He is on the wrong side of sympathy, so be prepared<br>  3) How do you know he is 100%?. he said so?|`|fgIbNRHfaa	I know this will sound self serving, but he needs to hire a good attorney.  Unfortunately, this is one of those instances where the public will presume him guilty until proven innocent.  A public place can ban someone, and if he goes there anyway, he can be arrested for entering and remaining.  I know it is unfair, but it is the way it is.  He needs to aggressively defend against the charges, and when he is vindicated, press charges against her for malicious prosecution and defamation.  (All of this assumes you are correct and he is in fact innocent).  Good luck!

fShh29dPaa	There are 2 reasons why we shouldn't have more gun control-<br>  <br>  1. We ALREADY have enough laws on the books that punish crimes with guns.  Guns are just a tool.  Like a hammer or a car or a baseball bat.  All of those could be used by someone to hurt or kill someone.  Should we take away people's rights to have cars, hammers, etc..?<br>  <br>  2. All you would be doing is taking away the right of a "law abiding citizen" from protecting themselves.  Right now we have laws that say you can't carry a gun on school property or in a Federal building.  So, to a criminal who wants to hurt/kill someone, this says people in here are defenseless.  I have a permit to carry a concealed weapon.  If I follow the law, (and don't carry on these properties) then I am unable to defend myself & if I don't (follow the law) and I am stopped or searched for some other (non-violent) reason I would be charged with a crime.<br>  <br>  People complain about gun violence.  The answer is not less guns but MORE guns.  If criminals knew that more people could defend themselves, they might think twice.  They are not going to follow the law ANYWAY!!  Police are wonderful, but they usually get there after the fact.  You have a RIGHT, some would say an obligation, to defend yourself, your family & your community from people who would do them harm.  Imagine a criminal going into a bank and saying "stick 'em up!" and having half the bank pull out a gun and point it right back in their face.  Yes people can get hurt with guns.  But if someone wants to do harm, they will do it - gun or no gun.  Children can get hurt with a gun too.  But, they can get hurt with a car too.  If you are a responsible car/gun owner, you will teach your children to not touch your guns or your car keys.  Keep them locked up, keep the keys out of reach or on your person.  If you don't, then you will have to answer for the mistake & live with the consequences<br>  <br>  Ordinary people defend themselves everyday, but the media ignores the stories.  If you really want to learn more about guns & the people who use them check out the site below.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	"Held:<br>  1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."|`|W0VL46gDaa	you just never know. <br>  <br>  I mean, why do people keep fire extinguishers in their house? IN CASE of fire. <br>  <br>  It seems with all our knowledge of criminals breaking in, stealing kids, shooting people- it would be foolish not to protect ourselves.<br>  <br>  *criminals will always beable to get their hands on guns*|`|MKrNZMVDaa	Guns don't kill, people do ... unfortunately there are too many deranged, unbalanced people who think they're Rambo living in America owning enormous arsenals of guns ... scary!!!|`|4WCLWhaTaa	"Its because they're all scared. They have guns and we have guns. Yaaay. In Britain the police don't carry guns so its "stop or I'll say stop again." Here in the US everyone has guns. Its in the constitution you have the right to bear arms or the right to arm bears whatever you wanna do. And the National Rifle Association says you have the right to carry armor piercing bullets if your a hunter. Why? How many deer are wearing a bullet proof vest?"<br>  Robin Williams<br>  <br>  There are extremes. And I have no problem with gun control. No one who only wants to use guns for legal purposes should have a problem with it. I do have a problem with removing the right to own a gun from American citizens altogether. I would have no problem with licensing them. You have to have a license for a car why not a weapon?|`|8MUj24s6aa	"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ...

v5SXqxo0aa	1. Stock Market Crash of 1929<br>  Although the stock market crash is not one and the same as <br>  the Great Depression, it is a major cause. Two months after the original crash in October, stockholders had lost more than $40 billion dollars. The stock market began to regain some of its losses by the end of 1930, but not enough to save the economy. <br>  NOW:<br>  The stock market has dropped obviously, but not as dramatically as Black Tuesday.<br>  <br>  2. Bank Failures<br>  During the 1930s over 9,000 banks failed. Bank deposits were uninsured and so as banks failed people simply lost their savings. Surviving banks were not sure of the economic situation and so were less likely to give out loans. <br>  NOW:<br>  This also occurs currently; banks are failing because banks are unwilling to lend to eachother, are less likely to give out home loans because they do not want properties dropping in value if people cannot pay back the loan. However, most people's accounts are insured to an extent now.<br>  <br>  3. Reduction in Purchasing Across the Board<br>  With the stock market crash and fears of further economic collapses,  people stopped buying as much. This meant those selling did not generate income, so they could not buy things from other people- an endless cycle. This also led to a reduction in the number of items produced and thus a reduction in the workforce. The unemployment rate rose above 25% of working individuals. Working individuals were usually men at this time, meaning most women are not counted in this percentage but also did not have jobs.<br>  NOW:<br>  This is a major problem currently- people are only likely to spend if they feel the economy won't collapse. The unemployment rate is  about 10% right now, so we are not as dire- but we could get there.<br>  <br>  4. American International Policy<br>  As businesses began failing, the government created the Hawley-Smoot Tariff in 1930 to help protect American companies. This created a high tax for imports, meaning  less international trade between America and foreign countries along with some economic retaliation.<br>  NOW:<br>  Our major cause is the wars we are fighting abroad. The wars cost billions of dollars each year which the federal government cannot use to stimulate the economy.<br>  <br>  5. Droughts<br>  While not a direct cause of the Great Depression, the drought that occurred in the Mississippi Valley in 1930 was of such proportions that many could not even pay their taxes or other debts and had to sell their farms for no profit to themselves. <br>  <br>  Currently, global warming is causing droughts all over the country. California, a major producer of fruit and many plants that cannot grow elsewhere, is facing a drought right now, with spring planting just around the corner.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|R1LvhhTeaa	The 1929 Depression and this latest Depression is an old republican scam that they pull as often as they can.  First they allow the banks to make a lot of bad loans - so there's lots of bad paper around.  Also in the 20's they allowed people to buy stocks "on the margin" - to get in WAY over their heads.  <br>  <br>  Li'l Bush with his "Ownership Society" speech of 2003 was doing exactly the same thing - giving permission to the banks to continue and speed up making very risky loans.  <br>  <br>  And then when the bad paper gets deep enough, everybody realizes they've been had - and we have a Depression.<br>  <br>  But the reason the republicans do this is because during the Depression, prices (like is happening to real estate right now) come down like a rock- and the Super Rich can move in and scoop up the bargains.<br>  <br>  MONEY for Republicans - THAT'S what it's all about.  And you thought it was the Hokey Pokey.|`|AA10535085	lost confidence.|`|o35cQe3Iaa	The great depression was manipulated with money being thrown into the system without anything backing it up (hmm, sort of like what's going on now).  Then, the really wealthy elitist people took the money out real quick and made the stock market crash and then people went to banks (all at the same time) to get thier money out, but the banks had nothing to give them.  That's called a run on the bank.  When Roosevelt became president he came up with the New Deal.  The New Deal made a somewhat depression, into the Great Depression.  It made it hundreds of times worse and last for years upon years.  I have to laugh when people say the New Deal got us out of the Depression.  What got us out of the depression was World War 2 (building tanks, weapons, ammunition for Great Britain).  When more money is thrown into the system and production is not increased, we go further into debt, because there is nothing backing up our money.  The Federal Reserve is to blame.  They are not part of the government (even though it says 'Federal'), and they are basically a bunch of thieves.  If you or I printed money backed by nothing we would go to jail.  Somehow I don't understand how the Federal Reserve gets away with this lunacy.  Fractional reserve banking is a sin.|`|m3jb9qjdaa	Watch the news and you'll find out. A great(er) depression is being created right before our eyes.|`|4gyOqTqGaa	do you even care?|`|KJmu6Q6Aaa	1. Stock Market Crash of 1929<br>  <br>  Many believe erroneously that the stock market crash that occurred on Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929 is one and the same with the Great Depression. In fact, it was one of the major causes that led to the Great Depression. Two months after the original crash in October, stockholders had lost more than $40 billion dollars. Even though the stock market began to regain some of its losses, by the end of 1930, it just was not enough and America truly entered what is called the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  2. Bank Failures<br>  Throughout the 1930s over 9,000 banks failed. Bank deposits were uninsured and thus as banks failed people simply lost their savings. Surviving banks, unsure of the economic situation and concerned for their own survival, stopped being as willing to create new loans. This exacerbated the situation leading to less and less expenditures.<br>  <br>  3. Reduction in Purchasing Across the Board<br>  With the stock market crash and the fears of further economic woes, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing items. This then led to a reduction in the number of items produced and thus a reduction in the workforce. As people lost their jobs, they were unable to keep up with paying for items they had bought through installment plans and their items were repossessed. More and more inventory began to accumulate. The unemployment rate rose above 25% which meant, of course, even less spending to help alleviate the economic situation.<br>  <br>  4. American Economic Policy with Europe<br>  As businesses began failing, the government created the Hawley-Smoot Tariff in 1930 to help protect American companies. This charged a high tax for imports thereby leading to less trade between America and foreign countries along with some economic retaliation.<br>  <br>  5. Drought Conditions<br>  While not a direct cause of the Great Depression, the drought that occurred in the Mississippi Valley in 1930 was of such proportions that many could not even pay their taxes or other debts and had to sell their farms for no profit to themselves.

Even though Africans were selling rival tribes, but you have to remember that the less people on the other tribe means less attacks, and people sell stuff because they don't care about it. They believe the white man was all about taking people out of other countries and mistreating them, which is partially true, but there were some good slave owners. Also, this is a HUGE stereotype. White men are being held responsible for events that occured years ago, before they were born. But now, it is being made up for, as other races get 'first dibs' at jobs and college oppurtunities, so people who still think we are responsible should really get their heads back down to Earth.|`|P240bUFxaa	While some of this is true, I have a little questioning for you.  Wasn't it a white man by the name of William Lynch who shared tactics with many other white men on how to "control" their slaves by abusing them mentally and making them stronger physically.  His theory was to break down the black slave mentally but to keep the physical assets for himself.  This is where the word Lynching comes from.  And was it not the white men who would hang black people from trees and crosses and set them on fire? Was it not the white men who put up signs in their store windows and on their public restrooms forbiding black men or women from using their facilities?  White men who wouldnt even allow a black person to walk on the same sidewalk as them?  White men who created the Jim Crow laws in the south?  The black people do not ask of retribution from you or your ancestors, but for the things that used to happen not be forgotten.  And just because our white president,god bless his soul, made a law that forbid any slave ownership or racism, that does not mean people (white people) followed that law or even respected it.|`|mlpYzrtvaa	They lack the formal education to understand that the entire world was complicit with slavery and that it still exist to me, it's their poor mme card.

You may be better off entering the academy in Arkansas if that's where you will be residing.<br>  <br>  BTW, in Ohio academies cost around $3000. Yours seems really high.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	While it may work for you in Florida, it may be that Arkansas simply won't accept Florida police training, or that your particular department has made it a policy to send all new officers through their school, regardless of prior training.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is, if you already know what department you want to work for, and if they're already telling you they won't accept your training...save that money.  $ 7k is a hell of a lot of money.

JDltTREfaa	Write a letter to the police department.  Provide detailed information.  (The more detail you provide the more credible you will seem.  If you just write:  "The XYZ Restaurant serves alcohol to minors" the letter will almost certainly be tossed into the trash.  If you provide the days, times, and waitresses and/or bar tenders that server underage drinkers they will be more likely to take you seriously.)<br>  <br>  Don't sign your name.

Really.<br>  <br>  If you insist on going through with this, though, then I recommend calling the restaurant (dialing *67 before the number to block caller ID), and telling them that if they continue to serve alcohol to minors you will report them.  That way, they at least have a chance to stop before suffering legal consequences, and underage drinkers won't get arrested in a bar-raid situation.  It really isn't fair that minors can vote, go to war, and live independently, but not have an alcoholic beverage.  Please just don't go straight to the police, because it's not fair that responsible "minors" may have criminal records for enjoying a drink or two.  Just give them fair warning before reporting them.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	NC ALE <br>  <br>  Charlotte: District VIII<br>  Address:  500 W.

AA12361568	This probably isn't what you want to hear... but I don't think you should prevent him from pursuing this dream of his. If he has a passion to serve his country you should let him do that, and stand by him proud of him. You wouldn't want him to not join because of you, and then always look at you as the person that held him from his dreams. <br>  <br>  Not to mention, there are so many benefits for him if he joins. Our economy is not what it used to be. It's a lot harder to find a good job nowadays. Being in the military gives you a good career, with steady, good pay, excellent benefits... free health and dental, completely free college education, etc. If you would stand by him in this decision, and your relationship is strong enough you will be able to make it through all the time he'll be away. And if you make it through that you might end up getting married, and that way at least when he's not deployed or on training he will be home with you. =)<br>  <br>  My husband is Navy, stationed with the Marines over in Iraq as we speak. He had a fair amount training, where he was away from home, before the deployment. And then of course he's now gone for 7 months. I can tell you, his time away has actually helped our relationship. He will be coming back in April and our relationship is much stronger than when he left. We each have learned more about our selves since he's been gone. I have learned how to be more independent, and we've together learned how strong our love is. It's a great feeling! <br>  <br>  If you were to marry, you would get free housing on base, this includes free electric and water (and from what I've heard Air Force housing is the best, lol). Also, after he had been in the military for 6 years, with a promise of another 4 years, you would be eligible to receive his GI Bill. Which means that if you had college you still needed to complete, it would be completely paid for!<br>  <br>  There are many benefits for him joining the AF. More benefits than risks, in my opinion. Feel free to contact me if you have any question, I'm a military wife always more than happy to help out if I can! kbschaffer@gmail.com|`|EQ2bmd51aa	Just support him in whatever he decides..even when it's hard.|`|hrty14DEaa	well the Air Force ins't bad as you think it is. its a great opportunity he'll be able to travel and experience new things..if he feels like he needs to do this dont stop him from his dreams. your just going to hold him back in what he wants to do as a girlfriend u should support him =)<br>  yea he is going to be gone along period of time just be patient ..if ya'll both get married you could travel with him<br>  <br>  PROUD AIR FORCE WIFE =)|`|MKJAQ2koaa	First of all ask yourself how your boy friend would feel if you wanted to pursue a long distance career. The old saying goes if you love something set it free. Then again who knows he may get stationed in Hawaii and you get to move there too. Either way he would be doing his country a great favor by joining the air force/ or staying with you and maybe resenting you for it down the road. Probably not what you were looking for but if nothing else at least keep talking to him about it and try and respect each others hopes and dreams. Good Luck to both of you.|`|rF0zUeKvaa	What me and my girlfriend are going through is fairly comparable to your situation...I was planning on going to college where she lives to get closer, instead I chose to enlist in the Navy...it was a shadow decision I made with my mother and I told her with assurance in my voice...<br>  <br>  We've been together for 2 years now and in between months I would sporadically say "I would love to join the Navy"  She's been a great Navy girlfriend for the time being, but it's still hard to fathom why I would do it...which is understandable<br>  <br>  When she asked me why my response was the same as your boyfriends..."This is something I have to do" <br>  <br>  The Air Force is the best service I've learned for families and spouses...in time if you marry him you can stay on or near base with him...or that's what I've heard from scuttlebutt. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Army are probably the worst branches for relationships...weak ones at any rate...the very best for US-deployment is Army National Guard, Coast Guard, and of course Air Force...<br>  <br>  Trust me, if this is something "he has to do" he has to do it, frankly...If you love him, try your best to support and advocate his decision to take the Oath of Enlistment...there is no shame in not wanting him to go, however...<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I wasn't a lot of help, I just wanted to contribute my input<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your future Airman (should he decide to join)

esOaJoqBaa	Don't join. Even in the infantry you will spend 4 years in the military and see a total of maybe 72 hours of actual fighting. The rest will be training or sitting around. Even most of your patrols in combat will be boring. Tough luck. A person like you would not do well in a position requiring as much discipline as the US military, much less the infantry.<br>  <br>  P.S. The military is not all about strength. It is about mental toughness and patience. It takes a lot more that muscle to make a warrior.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking up some sort of organized martial arts classes. They will be a way of getting a lot of that bent up frustration out, as well as developing discipline. Stay busy, the more free time you have the more time there is to think about stupid sh!t like killing. Get a productive job or hobby. Later if you have mellowed out and develped discipline then you maybe could join.|`|AA11452842	If you see action or not will depend on the job you select.

You have so many choices on where you want to go what units to support. The missions are amazing in Iraq. You learn a lot of information, you get dirty. <br>  <br>  Convoys in Iraq are fun but dangerious are taken very seriously. You learn the most intimate things about people when your sitting in the cab of your truck with a radio in one ear and another person with you. I went from hating someone to be completely honored. This MOS does not get much respect we are considered POG's (person other than grunt) but we are the achillies heal of the military. We transport food, water, fuel, ammo, gear, housing, and vehicles. We pick up the ruins of others misfortunes (no not bodies, blown up vics). that can be taken as positive or negative which either way you want to preseve this. <br>  <br>  Bad thing about this MOS. Well it is dangerious it is considered a Combat Arms MOS. We are one of the most saught after targets in war (being the re-suppliers of the front lines). Our vehicles are big, loud, and heavy doesn't make for a good combination when things go BOOM. Sad thing is accidents do happen and your lucky if you hear good things come from accidents. Most the time people don't have a chance. You work long, hot or cold (yes it snows in Iraq and Afghan), tiresome hours. You will become dependent on red bulls and rip-its(knock off cheap brand of energy drinks they give out for free). You will see things you don't want to see when you have to help out other units when they have been attacked. You do live every minute of your while your driving down the road as if it was your last, praying to god the security infront of you will spot danger before your truck does. The trucks don't have AC but the heaters do sure *** hell work, (130 degrees in the shade imagine a re-enforced metal box). Trucks are OLD AS HELL vietnam era, they break down all the time, you don't have to fix it really but losing a truck is like loosing a Marine something else has got to pick up the slack. <br>  <br>  Promotion is a ****** to pick up, Motor T is the second largest MOS next to infantry. But everything is worth every drop of blood, sweat and tear. It's definatly a job that makes you enjoy your evening shower. Nothing like driving down the road with a 45ft trailor and a duece and half on it and people just stare at you like "oh shyt". Or the look on your fellow Marines when your bring them Ice on those hot nights in Iraq, even though they don't tell you thank you or cut you some slack, their faces show a 1000 words. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend this MOS to anyone who wants to join. And yes to anyone who doesn't know. We do carry heavy machine guns to it's not just the Infantry. <br>  <br>  I am female Marine and I was a 249 Saw Machine gunner in Iraq twice. And I loved it, I will never lat move (but I might not re-enlist either haha). <br>  <br>  Hope this answered your question.|`|7idyT7Obaa	simply put, yes.<br>  the only way i would suggest it to anyone is if its the only MOS you qualify for.<br>  88Ms drive from one fob to another with other 88Ms, who have NO combat experience or even decent combat training. if anything happens, you might as well be out with regular civilians and hope the infantry shows up to save your ***.<br>  most soldiers, especially ones from MOSs that have combat jobs, will treat you like a useless idiot.<br>  the army is alot like a football team: you have your linebackers, QB, receivers, etc...the ones who actually fight and win against the opposing team. then you have your support who doesnt play the game: water boys, towel boys....thats your 88Ms...throw them up against the opposing team and they'll get creamed.|`|p2VYfJj8aa	i've been in MT for 9 years now, including 2 tours in iraq. yes it has its drawbacks, but with the new equipment, and proper training, its a good job. sure you'll get shot at a lil more than normal, but thats why your armored. and a plus is you'll get to see a lot more of every contry you visit, not just the FOB. <br>  <br>  MT is a much needed MOS as there are often no way to get manpower and supplies out to the FOBS.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Go out to the street.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I'm not  - on practical grounds - not out of any sympathy for criminals. You may be surprised by what follows so I listed sources:<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade.

The reason prison is not a violation of liberty (assuming the criminal is guilty), is that the inmate has committed a crime against the rights of another. If you do not show respect for the rights of others, your own rights are forfeited.<br>  <br>  Now follow that done the line and logically it makes sense that if you violate another persons right to life by murdering them, then you forsake your own right to life.<br>  <br>  But our forefathers were not without mercy.

Get a lawyer to fight the charge.  They should file a discovery motion.  Your lawyer will see all of the evidence against you when that motion is granted.  Then you will have a good idea of how strong your case is and how strong the prosecution case is.  Discovery will give you a chance to view any available dash-cam footage, any statements relating to the case, and all reports!  <br>  <br>  If you try to defend yourself on this charge without the help of a lawyer, remember this old saying.<br>  <br>  A person who represents himself has a fool for a client!|`|3yrpDNavaa	If you were weaving from side to side, then it would be reasonable for an officer to believe that you were drunk.  It's called "reasonable suspicion."  It is a lesser standard than probable cause.  In such a situation, because there is less than probable cause, the officer may detain (not arrest) you only long enough to confirm, or dismiss, his suspicions.  So, in your case, he suspected you were drunk, gave you a quick test, confirmed you were not drunk, and let you on your way.  That's all OK.<br>  <br>  Google "Terry stop" for more information.|`|24kFbAdsaa	You don't say, but if you were weaving, even within your own lane, that's probable cause to pull you over for DUI.  Was it very early in the morning and your lights were off?  Probable cause.  Did he see you have difficulty entering your car after you left a bar?  Probable cause.  He asked, you responded in the affirmative, therefore he tested at the legal limit and you failed.  .08 and above is the point to cite you for a DUI; it is not the legal limit to drive - be careful of how you interpret the law.|`|oFcrglxzaa	you were drinking and even though you tested under the limit, the officer's had every right to pull you over, alcohol affects everyone differently what is the limit for you to still be able to operate a motor vehicle may be too much for another, you sound like you have a drinking problem and should rethink defending it, PS the next time your old man makes a suggestion, cover your ears|`|b8svqAMAaa	I can tell you that every single traffic stop I make I ask the driver "How much have you had to drink tonight?"  It's just something I ask even if I have no reason to believe that they had been.  You could have been stopped for just about anything.  Perhaps you unknowingly drove on or over the double yellows.  If the legal limit is .08 and you blew a .08 then you should have been arrested for DUI.  If you blew under and the officer administered FST's or Field Sobriety Tests and you did poorly, you could still have been arrested for driving under the influence if that officer thought that you were unsafe to drive.  Did you ask the officer why he pulled you over?  Good luck, I am sure the officer didn't pull you over for no reason.

It is settled law in California that you do NOT forfeit the ability to go to traffic school by going to trial.  It is, however, discretionary with the hearing officer, as correctly stated by tonalc2 (who was not guessing, because I know she has seen this issue discussed before).  (See People v. Schindler (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 431; People v. Wozniak (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 43.)

It's up to the judge if he wants to grant it to you or not - yes, it IS a gamble. If you know you can take traffic school, I'd definitely take that option. In my opinion, it's not worth the risk to fight it when you know you can already take traffic school, considering your insurance might go up with the extra point in your driving record if you don't.<br>  <br>  Traffic school is very cheap itself (aside from the ticket and court fee). Less than $13 online! I highly recommend www.gototrafficschool.com because it's fast, easy, cheap and they automatically send the certificate to the court when you're done.<br>  <br>  Use discount code XMC-399-E7E on top of their cheap as hell prices for an additional discount.

He used Barry up until he ran for Senate, lol|`|0PxqeZvFaa	Hadji, is a sell out.|`|qjptIgKZaa	Doubtful that he is ashamed.  try teaching a four year old to spell Piyush.  Plus, he may have wanted to fit in at school at a time when there weren't that many Indian-Americans in Louisiana.  <br>  <br>  Bob Sanders, of the Indianapolis Colts, isn't really Bob.   His real name is Da Mon.  Bob was easier, so he called himself Bob.|`|0ICrA2Nxaa	Because Piyush is a sh*t name thats why.<br>  If you were named Assface by your parents would you go around telling people your name was Assface or would you change it?|`|2a99edbbb4b5465e75a302e04746c959aa	Oh no!  Piyush!  What a horrible name!  AHHH!  Non-Northwestern-European names are SOOOOOO BAD!<br>  <br>  <rolleyes>|`|5gOyGK4Kaa	He changed it when he was just a boy because people like you made fun of him for his name in grade school and thats not a joke he really did change it for that reason|`|1amF7oNwaa	PROBABLY THE SAME REASON RICHARD VALENZUELA BECAME RITCHIE VALENS|`|tDZMJue9aa	but obama did use barry for years....did he not? lots of kids identify with the brady bunch...my birth sister was adopted when she got to choose her new name..cindy it came from the brady bunch..so whats wrong with that.....|`|TFdKrkP2aa	It seems that at the core of all Republicans is a liar.|`|MDq1XVWRaa	Because when everyone finds out he took his name from Bobby Brady on the Brady bunch he will be the laughing stock of the usa.... wait a minute he already is.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Because Bobby is easier to say.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	And that matters how? Is this the left-wing's "intellectual" refutation of Jindal? LOL. What jokes you are.
mINwDdXtaa	It is bankrupt now! The domino effects will soon shatter the foundations of this country! The people have been hoodwinked and plenty!|`|twPZBsH2aa	What happens is a government simply prints money. There is no need to declare bankruptcy, all the Obama government has to do is print more money (something the states can't do, and you can't do legally either).<br>  <br>  The result is the dollar becomes worth less, and other countries stop investing in anything denominated in Dollars.<br>  <br>  IT will mean that the USA becomes a 3rd world country, like, strangely enough, where Obama's brother and father live.|`|krRCVZL4aa	never, their to arrogant to,<br>  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DROWNING IN DEBT<<br>  PAY CANADA BACK YOU USA PERSONS!!!|`|IhF2zT5maa	Lets wait and see.

Where the hell is going to work everyday??)|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Then they wouldn't have anything to lie to their supporters about.You know the lies about how they got those certain programs into the bill which will bring jobs to the home districts.Even though they didn't actually vote for the bill.|`|AA11581903	So, its o.k. for the democrats to keep their earmarks?|`|grdJOwuXaa	In some ways it would, but since earmarks make up something like 1% of the spending it wouldn't be noticeable.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Good call, homie. They won't do it. 2nd ammendment stimulus package? Buy a new gun from a pushover, and 1k rounds and 5 mags. I'm getting really sick of this nonsense.|`|AA12191521	It would be a smart move. It would be a largely symbolic gesture. But it would go a long way toward painting the difference between the two parties. As it is the Republicans look like part of the problem rather than the solution.
8vt8Y6UQaa	It makes you wonder what CRACK the guy is smokin'....And now all the smartass comments that the liberals had when he first got elected, are now SPEECHLESS. They can wipe the egg off of all of their faces...cuz OBAMA should be synonomous with DANGER.<br>  <br>  We will all SUFFER from his nonsensical spending...I MEAN, HE LIED, SAYING BUSH SPENT TOO MUCH (BEFORE HE GOT ELECTED) AND NOW HE'S BAMBOOZLED US WITH HIS HYPOCRTIC SPENDING...HE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Quit listening to the news already.  You think we're made of money?  Jeez...|`|r2JPcUN8aa	You should call the President.  You sound really really smart.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	He knows what he is doing. The goal is to tear down the system so the only hope is government. Just look at what these liberals are doing to tax deductions on charitable donations. They are making the deduction only $0.28 for every $1 you donate. Yeah, that'll get people to donate more. Again, the goal is to bankrupt these organizations so the government can take them over.<br>  <br>  Power....that's the goal.<br>  <br>  Added: You liberals on here just don't get it do you? YES the republican spending was horrible....so why do you use that a defense to spend more?!  Two wrongs will make it right huh? This is the mentality of the liberal....."you did it so we can too, even if it's horrible for the country, we will just accelerate the spending". Nice.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	The President has proposed 2 Trillion dollars in spending cuts as well.  Don't forget about that.|`|pgdTmT6caa	I'll say it again.  Welcome to the United States Socialist Republic of America.  It's all part of the new world order|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	He is just trying to appease everyone.|`|nRAB0tl8aa	Honestly the reason why he is setting money to be spend is so he can STIMULATE the economy. Saving government money up is just going to make the economy work. <br>  <br>  Think of it like this the government doesnt spend money business dont do well. When businesses dont do well they fire/lay off the unneeded jobs. With the people that got layed off can find a job and apply for welfare/ unemployment.(Meanwhile the economy literally goese to hell) good job the dollar is now worth a nickel maybe a penny.Thank God your not our president!!|`|plFyCtm3aa	You need to understand that any kind of stimulus package does not bring back an extremely positive result in a matter of months. Especially with the current economy. The package will bring wealth over a long period of time. And Obama has indirectly pointed that out numerous times. Just wait. Hopefully, this country will return to normal. Normal being the days before Bush.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	Thats what liberals do spend other peoples money , what would you expect from a socialist liberal.!!!!!!!!|`|ORs9x3rRaa	What's the point of them just saving it? You might as well have it and spend it and therefore help keep jobs.|`|55NKPb82aa	Well Pelo err......i mean congress have to write the bill before Obama signs it.|`|7UqccTp6aa	He's like a little kid who just found a lot of money and he's off to the candy store.

Really?  MOST AMERICANS were not happy with the Iraqi war once it became clear the that Bush administration doctored the evidence to get us into that war.<br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with the residual force as there is also an end date for their time in Iraq.|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	Bush's ACCOMPLISHMENT!?!?!?!

Two trucks, and old Jeep to take on vacation and a cool G35 when I want to feel sporty. I will have to be content with function over style. At least for a few more years.|`|AA11828121	you do realize it's 13.00 a paycheck, which is 26.00 a month which is approx. 312.00 a year that you are getting back.........That's a car payment or tons of gas.<br>  <br>  Before you post retarded questions you should find out what is really going on...|`|aFC72tLZaa	You fail to see that this will pump billions into the economy.  You have to look beyond your conservative nose and look at the big picture.|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	Only bitter Republicans complain about getting money in their pockets. It would have been double that (or over 100 bucks a month more) if not for the Republicans and their negotiations.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	not me, I don't trust GM who loses 107 Million dollars a day, Ford is OK though, but they never took any Federal Bail out money because they know how to run a business|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Yours will be spent at Walmart no doubt!|`|AA11993919	LOL.|`|nx7QtF0paa	I'm going to buy a gun, while I still can|`|BjxRFzMiaa	while my employer cuts my hours due to higher taxes|`|4Vmlf902aa	Not me, or my parents.

vIO2jWu9aa	much more than they deserve. $1 is too much!<br>  <br>  I heard it was about 4 million but that might have changed.|`|4JiYP60laa	Don't you remember there were no earmarks. Apparently the $8B railroad to Vegas from California wasn't an earmark either. <br>  <br>  Of course since Corporate events won't be going to Vegas anymore I guess that money will be really well spent as well.
e8b923cf5f1a4b5a6f8a105422acf9adaa	It made her look a tad bit smarter. She probably would've did better at giving the speech. You betcha!|`|yprHJNHAaa	Actually, I think it was a great night for the Dems!  Palin will be Palin...and I think the more she talks the deeper the hole she digs for herself.  And YES,....the Jindal speech was absurd, full of garbage and very painful.|`|AA10138269	This only raise more questions on whether they actually have some one competent to run this country from the GOP. The GOP is definitely up a dung creek without a paddle.|`|SpBAcRJmaa	Raised the possibility that there was a GOP leader stupider than her.|`|LVHksUMPaa	He made her look like a genius.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Well, as little as I think of Palin, she never sounded as bad as Jindal did on Tuesday night.  She looked like a DIAMOND compared to Jindal merely because she appears more educated (I am coughing as I state that. . .).|`|WTHTVJN6aa	That statement is pure stupidity. While I admit that his delivery was not as smooth as I have heard from him before, the content of his speech was very good. It laid out the differences in vision between liberals and conservatives and offered conservative alternative solutions in a clear, concise manner that people can understand.|`|NqNbIp2caa	I think what he is trying to say is the GOPs leadership stocks are so thin that the 2012 nomination race has already come down to only these two lightweights.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	It may have been a disappointing first national speech for Jindal but he is one true Conservative!|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I guess the GOP knows.

Can we keep our social security payments too?|`|SJHk9Omfaa	dem's / repub's whats the difference ? congress is controlled by powers other than voters. There ambition is to continue in congress at all costs. Thats why every politician's objective is to bring checks to their districts to gloat about how wonderful they are and are doing everything for their constituents. maybe the real question should be should politicians' be held more responsible.|`|YFzprqqgaa	Sounds great to me, but like the other guy said, "if taxes are assessed accordingly".  I want nothing more from the government than protection from our enemies and a legitimate promise that they will require as little as possible of my own money, and thats all.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	if i did not have to pay into those programs i would be more than willing to not use them|`|AA12229787	Sure no problem...<br>  As long as we are exempt from any new taxes on anything...<br>  Wed be rich compared to you in no time !

PG2gd1tOaa	It's not and my 401k is proving that with the stock market trashed by Obama.|`|QZicQ0kuaa	ABC News showed 2 examples of tax increases/decreases. The "rich" guy will only pay $300 more per $10,000 they said without any mention of his 39% he already pays and his loss of charitable deduction. The media bias continues. <br>  <br>  NY State will increase their tax rate to 12% on that family. How much of that 10K do they get to keep? Not much, and do you have any idea how many hours go into making another 10K?<br>  <br>  The Democrats will not stop until you don't even bother working extra hours for that money because it will no longer be worth it.|`|TQYQUNYHaa	Obama is spending too much monies at the wrong time.

Mao did it in China with his re-education camps and his Little Red Book. The alternatives were death or prison for noncompliance.

Scion of a simple family, offspring of a miraculous union, grandson of a typical white person and an African peasant. And yea, as he grew, the Child walked in the path of righteousness, with only the occasional detour into the odd weed and a little blow. <br>  <br>  When he was twelve years old, they found him in the temple in the City of Chicago, arguing the finer points of community organisation with the Prophet Jeremiah and the Elders. And the Elders were astonished at what they heard and said among themselves: “Verily, who is this Child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope?” <br>  <br>  Background<br>  Obama fears the Blair effect as tour continues <br>  The Europhiles are not the future, Mr Obama <br>  The Bugle - Barack Obama is coming to Europe! <br>  Our leaders go after some Obama magic <br>  In the great Battles of Caucus and Primary he smote the conniving Hillary, wife of the deposed King Bill the Priapic and their barbarian hordes of Working Class Whites. <br>  <br>  And so it was, in the fullness of time, before the harvest month of the appointed year, the Child ventured forth - for the first time - to bring the light unto all the world. <br>  <br>  He travelled fleet of foot and light of camel, with a small retinue that consisted only of his loyal disciples from the tribe of the Media. He ventured first to the land of the Hindu Kush, where the <br>  <br>  Taleban had harboured the viper of al-Qaeda in their bosom, raining terror on all the world. <br>  <br>  And the Child spake and the tribes of Nato immediately loosed the Caveats that had previously bound them. And in the great battle that ensued the forces of the light were triumphant. For as long as the Child stood with his arms raised aloft, the enemy suffered great blows and the threat of terror was no more. <br>  <br>  From there he went forth to Mesopotamia where he was received by the great ruler al-Maliki, and al-Maliki spake unto him and blessed his Sixteen Month Troop Withdrawal Plan even as the imperial warrior Petraeus tried to destroy it. <br>  <br>  And lo, in Mesopotamia, a miracle occurred. Even though the Great Surge of Armour that the evil Bush had ordered had been a terrible mistake, a waste of vital military resources and doomed to end in disaster, the Child's very presence suddenly brought forth a great victory for the forces of the light. <br>  <br>  And the Persians, who saw all this and were greatly fearful, longed to speak with the Child and saw that the Child was the bringer of peace. At the mention of his name they quickly laid aside their intrigues and beat their uranium swords into civil nuclear energy ploughshares. <br>  <br>  From there the Child went up to the city of Jerusalem, and entered through the gate seated on an ***. The crowds of network anchors who had followed him from afar cheered “Hosanna” and waved great palm fronds and strewed them at his feet. <br>  <br>  In Jerusalem and in surrounding Palestine, the Child spake to the Hebrews and the Arabs, as the Scripture had foretold. And in an instant, the lion lay down with the lamb, and the Israelites and Ishmaelites ended their long enmity and lived for ever after in peace. <br>  <br>  As word spread throughout the land about the Child's wondrous works, peoples from all over flocked to hear him; Hittites and Abbasids; Obamacons and McCainiacs; Cameroonians and Blairites. <br>  <br>  And they told of strange and wondrous things that greeted the news of the Child's journey. Around the world, global temperatures began to decline, and the ocean levels fell and the great warming was over. <br>  <br>  The Great Prophet Algore of Nobel and Oscar, who many had believed was the anointed one, smiled and told his followers that the Child was the one generations had been waiting for. <br>  <br>  And there were other wonderful signs. In the city of the Street at the Wall, spreads on interbank interest rates dropped like manna from Heaven and rates on credit default swaps fell to the ground as dead birds from the almond tree, and the people who had lived in foreclosure were able to borrow again. <br>  <br>  Black gold gushed from the ground at prices well below $140 per barrel. In hospitals across the land the sick were cured even though they were uninsured. And all because the Child had pronounced it. <br>  <br>  And this is the testimony of one who speaks the truth and bears witness to the truth so that you might believe. And he knows it is the truth for he saw it all on CNN and the BBC and in the pages of The New York Times. <br>  <br>  Then the Child ventured forth from Israel and Palestine and stepped onto the shores of the Old Continent. In the land of Queen Angela of Merkel, vast multitudes gathered to hear his voice, and he preached  to them at length. <br>  <br>  But when he had finished speaking his disciples told him the crowd was hungry, for they had had nothing to eat all the hours they had waited for him. <br>  <br>  And so the Child told his disciples to fetch some food but all they had was five loaves and a couple of frankfurters. So he took the bread and the frankfurters and blessed them and told his disciples to feed the multitudes. And when all had eaten their fill, the scraps filled twelve baskets. <br>  <br>  Thence he travelled west to Mount Sarkozy. Even the beauteous Princess Carla of the tribe of the Bruni was struck by awe and she was great in love with the Child, but he was tempted not. <br>  <br>  On the Seventh Day he walked across the Channel of the Angles to the ancient land of the hooligans. There he was welcomed with open arms by the once great prophet Blair and his successor, Gordon the Leper, and his successor, David the Golden One. <br>  <br>  And suddenly, with the men appeared the archangel Gabriel and the whole host of the heavenly choir, ranks of cherubim and seraphim, all praising God and singing: “Yes, We Can|`|fDuCamMraa	It's because of the lemming followers.

AZtlB3VMaa	Populist is the answer to the first question<br>  -- populists have liberal economic beliefs but conservative social beliefs<br>  <br>  <br>  Libertarian is your answer to the second<br>  -- libertarians have liberal social beliefs but conservative economic beliefs|`|zjpB2GARaa	This is not a valid question.  Populist refers to a style of political speaking in which a person incites the people against the elites.  It is ideologically neutral.  Both Andrew Jackson and William Jennings Bryan were populists, but their ideologies were diametrically opposed to one another.  Bryan was a theocrat and a socialist.  Jackson was one of the most libertarian presidents in American history (although he had many flaws, such as his Indian policy and his response to Vice President Calhoun's attempt to secede).<br>  <br>  Libertarians are neither "liberal" (in the modern American sense, which basically refers to what Europeans call Social Democracy, which is a variant of socialism) nor "conservative."  Libertarianism is a political philosophy based around the principles that the initiation of force is always wrong (even when it is done by a government) and that all human beings are born with the inalienable right of self-ownership.  Some within the libertarian movement have caused confusion by falsely defining libertarians as "socially liberal and fiscally conservative."  Social liberalism includes such things as "affirmative action" (more aptly referred to as reverse discrimination), "hate speech" legislation, and other absurdities that libertarians reject (of course, libertarians are split on abortion).  Fiscal conservatism often includes wasteful spending (such as that bloated "defense" budget that is larger than the "defense" budget of every other country combined) and handouts to wealthy special interest groups (for example, the "fiscally conservative" Michael Bloomberg, mayor of NYC, wasted billions in tax dollars on new baseball stadiums for the Yankees and Mets).<br>  <br>  So, basically the question you're being asked is not a valid question.
AA12191521	yes it is. It feeds on the lowest of human motivations. Envy. You convince those who have little to hate those that have much. You convince them that success can only be achieved through theft. So they view anyone that has more than them as a crook who must be punished. Its exactly what Hitler did in Germany. Why should those rich Jews have money when you are starving? Lets take everything from them and give it to you. And as long as you get money in your pocket, you won't say a word about what we do to them. Obama, Hitler, pretty much the same thing.|`|tDZMJue9aa	yes, make the poor hate the rich..make the rich dislike the poor and look down on them even more because most do not help themselves out of their shithole but expect the rich to pick up the tab|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Yes, very typical of the communist party<br>  <br>  Sam Webb, National Chair, CPUSA, writes on the web site:<br>  <a href="http://www.cpusa.org/article/articleview/1015/1/27/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpusa.org/article/articleview...</a><br>  “Just look at the new lay of the land: a friend of labor and its allies sits in the White House.

Class warfare is the result of the "have's" keeping their foot on the backs of those who "have not".

Posts are typically deleted because other users disagree with the content.  <br>  <br>  You do not have an absolute right to post whatever you wish on this site.  It is a free forum offered by a private company.  That company sets the rules. They can delete or cause to be deleted any post at any time.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yahoo has a fair set of Terms of Service and rules to go by.  Neither of those were good subjects to discussion items, so they had a right to censor them.|`|AA10753168	People can report a question or answer that they find offensive.  Yahoo seems inclined to honor their feelings more often than not, by deleting the "offensive" material.  The point is that Yahoo Answers is a virtual community of sorts.  As is the case with any community, its members have the right and responsibility to establish and enforce its standards.  Some might refer to this as censorship, but it should be understood that some degree of self-regulation is needed in all matters that define any community.  Without the establishment and enforcement of community parameters, we become nothing more than self-absorbed, self-serving individuals with no regard for the sensitivities of our fellow community members.  Does this mean that we should forfeit the right to express our opinions?  Of course not, but it doesn't mean we should forfeit our corresponding community responsibilities or disrespect the rights of others to defend community standards.|`|fCB7TTBCaa	I think it is just Yahoo! trying to thin out the trolls. I'm sure it has something to do with bandwith too. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in censorship but I also know that we could have it much worse. It's not like the government is this group of superior individuals that try to keep us in the dark. I think that they try to reach an acceptable medium to compromise with those of us who think that censoring is the government's responsibility and those who think it should be the parent's.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	Yahoo is very careful about what they allow because they used to have a message board system that was abused. People got all kinds of butt-hurt over it and starting filing lawsuits because they got their feelings hurt or offended. So Yahoo, in turn, really cracked down on all of their features. You can still say what you want in private emails... but that's about it. It's terrible, I'd rather they allowed all of it and leave it up to the individual to read or not read what they want.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	You are a sicko, but that is beside the point.<br>  <br>  Anyone who would have "good" knowledge on a subject such as the one aforementioned should be castrated and thrown in a pit to die. <br>  How's that for uncensored raw opinion?<br>  <br>  Anyone that would do anything to harm a child is about the lowest and base creature on the planet.

Hf8DlmLqaa	We can't afford universal heath care. We can't afford anything right now because in my mind when your in debt you shouldn't be adding to it. Being able to "Afford" something implies you have the money to begin with which we clearly don't.|`|5IWzBf1eaa	i assume you are asking this question because your brain is so undeveloped, that you cannot comprehend anything but what the media puts out for you to see. Do a little digging.  We cannot afford universal health care.  And we should not want universal health care.  Like i said before...do some digging.  In the UK and Canada there is a waiting list for treatment for various things.  Ranging from the common cold or a broken arm, to ******* cancer!  I have an employee that works for me in the UK and because of the "waiting list" his wife has not had an MRI for   her torn ligament in her knee for over a year and a half.  But me, i am American.  I can waltz down to my hospital and get an MRI in 15 minutes.  You see the thing about liberals, is that they do not think past the first "Step" if you will.  Like in my example, the liberals want everybody to be able to have the same health care.  Hence the term "Universal."  So having this system takes some pressure off of the Liberals hearts.  It makes them feel good.  And decisions based on feelings are worthless.  They need to be thought out.  Which the liberals are not doing.  They feel, then feel some more.  But they leave out the thinking part.  Hello!!!!!!!!!! Such Buffoons.  And if you do not believe me that a government operated health care system works, just look at medicare.  Nuff said about that.  So floating away from that...another huge predicament we would face with universal health care would be the loss of our best doctors to foreign countries.  Now, everybody has an Indian doctor at their local practice.  I'm not stereotyping.  So what if all of your doctors left the country because say...the government controlled their pay!  Personally i want my doctors and surgeons making at least $500,000.  Because i want the ones who graduated from the best schools with the most experience.  Not a graduate from Maulana Azad Medical College.  In India a you can graduate in as little as 2 years.  I want my doctors at school for at least 10. But thats just me. (By the way...Maulana Azad Medical College is the 6th best medical school in India, who would have thought...it has college in the title)  Sorry for the rambling...but i had to get this off my chest.  And because you mentioned bush...I've got to attack Barack Hussein Obama, cause it's only fair.  Great plan Idiot Obama...i mean President Obama.  Cause i mean everything you say is going to happen...like cutting our spending deficit in half by the end of your term.  Too bad that is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard.  Hands Down.  By the way...if every American with a job...that pays taxes...(so not stupid welfare *****) gave their entire salary to the government for one year...out spending deficit would only go down by 25%. And thats for one year.  With America not having a single penny in pay.  I close in saying this; Obama is a great speaker no doubt, but so was a fellow by the name of Adolf Hitler.  Farewell...and good luck with pulling trillions of dollars out of your *** Obama.|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	According to Bobby Jindal:   "We believe Americans can do anything"|`|vYAgIMLdaa	How can you NOT afford universal health care.

Those weapons are made for one thing - killing other humans.  I am fine with those weapons being off the street.  If someone is a collector, then I think they should subject themselves to extra background checks, and regular registration of any assault rifle they "collect".  If they truly are in it for just collecting this shouldn't be any sort of "inconvenience for them.<br>  <br>  No one can justify that there is no difference between sports rifles and assault rifles.  Both will kill, and if needed, a hunting rifle can be used as protection.  I don't get why someone must own an assault rifle.

0eFSeap5aa	In the movie, Back to School, Rodney Dangerfield has this literature class taught by Sally Kellerman.  She gives him an F on a paper about Kurt Vonnegut Jr, telling Rodney that she knows he didn't write the paper, and whoever did obviously doesn't know the first thing about Kurt Vonnegut Jr.  The punchline being that is who Rodney Dangerfield had hired to write the paper.<br>  <br>  The point is, who knows what the author meant by that statement.  You will find communism to be the most lost in the looking glass sort of meaningless nonsense you will ever encounter.  People who love intellectual complexity are seduced by the crap, believing that somewhere in the bowels of that unintelligible morass lies some truth or meaning.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	It was former communists, Boris Yeltsin and Mikial Gorbachev that ended the communists in Russia.<br>  Some give all the credit to Reagan which is not true. Reagan simply outbid the communists in the arms struggle, but the actual end was the communists themselves who grew to hate what they had created and decided to end it.<br>  In my minds eye I see the paradox, but explaining it is another story, but Gorby and Yeltsy were rivals and friends at the same time. Neither wanted failure, but both knew it was inevitable and when it did fail government in Russia saw no benefit instead seeing the resources of the state go to about 9 people who grabbed up everything and became fabulously wealthy until Putin came along and basically said: Give it all back or else.<br>  There's a whole lot more involved and I'm sure as it will rain again others will argue with me, but that's my read on it.

kZT828wJaa	I see talk about spies, the three stooges, and a revisionist Republican hatchet job on Roosevelt, but no one answered the asker's question.<br>  <br>  The UN was first proposed as a term and idea in 1942 in the "Declaration of United Nations" as a sort of war time alliance component in the Atlantic Charter. However, the UN as we know it today was created as an organization in June of 1945 when the organization charter was drawn up, and ratified by the permenant members of the security council, America, Russia, Britain, France, and China, along with the majority of the 46 general assembly participants.<br>  <br>  Who created the UN? All of these charter members really, especially those in the security council. Roosevelt and Churchill coined the term United Nations if that interests you.|`|a7b60e3673e24805f578c862bda4fb45aa	Before the United Nations there was a League of Nations.  They were horribly corrupt as is the United Nations and when they were forced to quit they just renamed as such.  It was basically the Yanks and Brits, though there were other supporters.  Their primary aim was to harm the Arab nations and get rid of the millions of poverty stricken and half crazed refugees that were trying to settle in Europe and North America after the Second World War.  They created Israel to achieve these aims.  Interestingly enough, even though the USA is the main supporter of the United Nations and holds a lot of power in that organisation they refuse to support the organisation as the present leaders might do something that doesn't fit the US agenda.|`|twPZBsH2aa	Roosevelt was behind it, and the Soviet Union got on the Security Council by manipulating Roosevelt (who in fact was sort of a lame president despite the Democrats who think he was great).<br>  <br>  Roosevelt also undermined England during WW2 by not supporting them when Churchill asked for help.<br>  <br>  Like Roosevelt and his plans to revive the economy that didn't work (what revived it was war) Obama is headed in the same direction by spending money on programs that don't fix the problems.<br>  <br>  We have a banking problem, not a public works problem. And even if you got the contract to build a bridge, where are you going to get the loan to buy the materials, machinery, pay for the design plans, etc., if you can't borrow money?  This Obama administration is made up of people with absolutely NO business experience, none have created a company, a product, hired people, met a payroll, they are all totally ignorant of what makes the economy work.<br>  <br>  It's a shame, but Obama has duped the ignorant and arrogant into voting for him, and now he's proving that at best, he can read a speech, but on details, he's a lightweight.<br>  <br>  Too bad, but you all had the chance to vote for Mitt Romney, who knows much more about the economy than anyone on Obama's team, and would have fixed the banking problems and lowered taxes, like Reagan did, to get the economy going again.<br>  <br>  Who creates jobs?

The new rule would have taken the Social Security Administration’s existing practice of sending a letter to employers indicating when an employee’s Social Security number did not match the agency’s files (so-called “no match?? letters, intended to be used solely for managing employees’ social security withholdings) and used it to require employers to fire any employee who received such a letter, within 90 days of receipt. The judge in the case stopped the rule from going into effect because Homeland Security did not take the required step of analyzing the consequences of the new rule for small businesses. The judge indicated the effect on small businesses could potentially be quite large, and could also cause irreparable harm to thousands of employees who were legally authorized to work, and received no-match letters due to clerical errors or other administrative problems.<br>  In many ways, this was a simple case for the court. There was a clear cut procedure to follow when implementing a new rule, the Department of Homeland Security failed to follow it, and the Social Security Administration could show that thousands of legally authorized workers would be adversely affected if the new rule went into effect. Most issues surrounding the recent zealous attempts at enforcing immigration law are much murkier. At the heart of this murkiness is the question of to what extent do immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, have the same legal protections as citizens?<br>  When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conduct immigration raids, they not need warrants to detain or to enter the home of individuals suspected by the agency of being in this country illegally. They do not need to read these individuals their rights when detaining them. However, as raids by ICE get more aggressive, and more and more state and local law enforcement agencies are teaming up with ICE to enforce federal immigration standards, or passing legislation creating their own immigration enforcement standards, the constitutionality of a separate standard for immigrants is being questioned. Federal lawsuits have been filed against county law enforcement agencies in, among other states, Connecticut, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Virginia, and against the state of Oklahoma. Two separate lawsuits have been filed against ICE, in New York and Texas; the latter by individuals who say ICE violated their rights during the raids at a Swift meatpacking plant.<br>  While most of these suits have just recently been filed, in July of this year the first case of this type was decided by a federal district court. The district court in Pennsylvania struck down the town of Hazleton’s local immigration ordinance as unenforceable under federal law, and in the process noted that the court’s analysis “applies to illegal aliens as well as to legal residents and citizens. The United States Constitution provides due process protections to all persons.??"<br>  ---------<br>  Claire Urban is a Law Student at the Boston College Law School|`|kbJt4065aa	HA! My LEGAL immigrant husband doesn't have anywhere near as many rights as a US citizen. Even though he was been laid off for over 3 months, he couldn'tt get food stamps neither can I because he lives in the same household. He's not allowed to vote. If he commits a crime, he can get deported. If we botch up the slightest detail on our next stage of immigration, he can be deported. If the immigration officer that interviews us next wants to be a jerk about it, our case can be denied if they're suspicious of our relationship. Try getting a job in this economy with a green card and an accent. He finally got one, making half what he used to doing the exact same job. <br>  If making a mistake can get you shipped halfway around the world, away from your family, friends, and basically your entire life, then MAYBE you could argue that citizenship isn't any better then being a LEGAL immigrant.  I can only imagine how much worse it must be for those who are illegal. Particularly those who have been in the US since a very young age. Imagine being deported to a country you don't even remember. <br>  If you really think that your rights are the same, I wish they'd deport you to a 3rd world country, as you don't appreciate your citizenship!|`|J7pNK6fYaa	The sad thing is that ILLEGAL INVADERS get MORE rights than US Citizens.

AA11511852	The biggest contrast between the two is that with JFK he wanted the people to do for the country and now this president wants the government to do for the people.<br>  "Ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country".  These words were from JFK and when I heard them as a young man I was inspired and have tried to do just what he asked from every person.<br>  He knew that the  government could not do it but like many men who went before him knew that the government was the problem.<br>  The man in office now seems to believe that only the government can solve any and all problems.|`|MNZ8iqFqaa	There is no comparison!!|`|mINwDdXtaa	Sorry , there is no comparision! John F. Kennedy was a president that stood on his own two feet! Obama on the other hand has speeches written for him! Not only that , Obama is in the pockets of the transnationals!

nzWux9Meaa	Yeah I agree that the senator is probably doing this out of fustration or possibly just plain stupidity. It is pretty funny becuase you can actually see his birth certificate on google images. If this senator had meant no harm in what he said then I say it is fine to want to make sure that President Obama is actually a U.S. citizen. There are probably two sides to this situation although and we will never know what Senator Shelby actually meant by what he said.Below is a link of President Obama's birth certificate. The Senator should have googled it ha ha.|`|OXmn9pe9aa	Sing me that same song in about a year|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	Shelby also claims to be the love child of Phyllis Diller and Bullwinkle.|`|677537c223fcb2159a6ca24056802ec5aa	I have news for you Fred, this Southerner DID NOT vote for the bum Obama.

That information is validated by legal authorities, who clearly have done so.|`|p2G5KJywaa	That's okay.. it doesn't matter even if he was born in Kenya and later registered his birth in Hawaii. So what? He is the President now,  quit being a sore loser. <br>  Even though there are actual living witnesses to his birth in Kenya. Forget about them, what the hell do they know. They're only his relatives and on top of that...they don't even speak English.<br>  Of course there are no witnesses to his birth in Hawaii, but that's okay. He was there, we'll take his word for it..<br>  Obviously, an actual certified birth certificate does not exist. That's why he has not provided one, he can't. If he had one he would've posted it instead of the form letter.  There is only a form letter that was presented as proof, that's good enough. <br>  We can't admit something this basic could ever slip through the cracks, let it go, ignore it. (maybe it'll go away?) <br>  He must have been born in the US since he was a senator. Surely somebody has checked before now. But senators don't have to be natural born citizens. Nor do college students or community organizers. But surely somebody checked...nobody admits to it....but we trust them anyway, it's the government. They wouldn't lie to US?.<br>  Even though his form letter has no witnesses signatures or doctors listed or even any specifics regarding the birth. We'll just let it go. Besides the "State" of Hawaii says it's good. "Yeah, okay, looks good to me"...said the desk monkey who wasn't there at the time and had no original record to compare it to.<br>  Perhaps we should just forget the whole thing.  There's no way anything like this could ever happen.<br>  Besides, the Constitution is just an old out of date piece of paper anyway. The requirement for presidency is especially obsolete. Anyone should be eligible.<br>  <br>  To top it all off....We the People don't have the right to question authority or those we vote into office. Who do we think we are, their bosses or something?<br>  Sure wouldn't want to upset anyone or cause any riots if it was true. Besides, it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities.<br>  I think Arnold Schwarzenegger should be our next President. Just look at what he's done in California.|`|4JiYP60laa	Look, as far as I can see Obama was born on Mars. He is totally clueless and has doomed the US and probably the planet base on his new $3.5 trillion spending plan. <br>  <br>  So we concede. Obama can be American.

Obama was inaugurated and then immediately got to work on making and passing bail out legislation.  The legislation just happened to get passed in February.

It's the one for combat troops worked out in the U.S.-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement negotiated by the Bush administration.|`|Hjwyb3vgaa	My opinion is Obama is an idiot who doesn't respect the military. I have fought in Iraq and know first hand we need to stay there. Also to you who say we kill Innocent people, we don't, try saying that to a Marines' face.<br>  <br>  EDIT: My point is these people dont have the guts to and bull others online. Most Marines will look at you and give back no reply or say "That is your opinion I have mine"|`|7WGKtkd0aa	Well honestly i believe Obama is going to at least take care of them for a little bit to get them rested to get back home.

Didn't he say 16 months?<br>  <br>  2.  What about all those combat troops being renamed to remain forever?<br>  <br>  3.  How, exactly does this differ from Bush's plan, or McCain's?|`|AA10438532	i think obama will tell any one anything they want to here if it makes him look good. i doubt he will have the troops home by then. i don't think he will get gitmo closed either. it's like when he said no earmarks, no lobbyists, and transparency. all lies.

ycwpFNWFaa	Depending on the situation, it was either the head of the community/village, the clergy/reglious man, and the King or nobleman of the land, with the balance of power being shared between the nobes/King and the church.<br>  <br>  Most medieval communities held hearings which were much speedier than today's lengthy trials. They usually lasted less than half an hour. If one member of a village claimed they'd been wronged, he or she would complain and every villager in the town had to join in the hunt and persecution of the criminal or they would all be held responsible as a whole.<br>  <br>  The Middle Ages were serious about their religious offenses. Each town's church generally ran its own kind of court to investigate everything from bad attendance to heresy. However, the church was also a place where criminals (who commited non-religious crimes) could avoid sentencing or punishment: they could cry "sanctuary" and the offenders could hang out, without fear of being followed. <br>  <br>  Criminals who committed lesser offenses were often subject to public humiliation, and a policy of three strikes and you're out—literally. Rather than killing them off or letting them clog up prisons, repeat offenders were often simply banished from a city and not allowed back. The offender usually went to the next village, and then the next.<br>  <br>  Capital punishment was sentenced only in the most serious of cases, which included murder, treason and arson. These criminals were usually hanged in full view of the public and was the highlight of the day.<br>  <br>  Beheading was considered a "privileged" way to die and was reserved mainly for members of nobility, rarely commoners. Treason was their crime of choice and the beheadings usually took place inside private castle walls.

We made college educations available to the returning soldiers  from World War II.   They took advantage of that opportunity.  Many of their children have also gone to college.    Tens of thousands of foreign nationals enroll in our colleges here.<br>  <br>  We outspent the Soviets,  and that their economy collapsed trying to compete.  <br>  <br>  We are the only country to have ever put people on the moon.<br>  <br>  We have safety nets to help combat  the excesses of  greed and dominance.   Many of the Republican Governors are refusing extensions of the unemployment benefits.  That is incredibly  dumb,  Sacrificing the downtrodden for their own political ideals.  <br>  <br>  I do not think  FDR wrecked the country.  <br>  <br>  Tell me would you rather live in Mexico where the truly rich  controlled the politics  during that same time frame, and almost everyone else was truly poor?

Your opinion does not matter.<br>  SCOTUS or supreme court of the United States said in the Heller decision "the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation," including "all instruments that constitute bearable arms." They therefore do not have the right to take away OR ban so called assault weapons. <br>  Which that is itself a joke. So-called assault weapons are military rifles, which the ones available to the public are REPLICAS incapable of automatic or burst mode firing which is what makes such rifles so dangerous. Your average deer rifle is Massively more powerful AND deadly than a military style rifle. More powder, larger bullets, capable of a vastly increased range. Why are we mesmerized by these guns?<br>  The whole talk of firing from the hip is ludicrous. No stability, no accuracy, and no control. Your likely to drop it and you certainly wont hit what your not even aiming it. <br>  <br>  Back on track. Not surprised one bit. But if its anything like the original pioneered by the Brady Campaign and the Clinton administration have no fear. You will be able to purchase the same rifle legally with a few minor modifications. And if they pass the magazine limit they will have several hundred thousand instant felons wont they? No reason to grandfather something like that.|`|O3TuQZItaa	This is of course only the first step in the plan to remove all guns from the hands of the American peons.<br>  <br>  First, let's talk about the lie that is being sold to you. The "Assault Rifles" that are being talked about are semi auto hunting rifles with SCARY features such as pistol grips and black plastic stocks. They fire medium power cartridges, and you have to pull the trigger for each shot.<br>  <br>  The guns that they are talking about banning are not real Assault Rifles. Real Assault Rifles are full automatic or selective fire. They will continue to fire for as long as the trigger is held down.<br>  <br>  For you hunters out there that say these guns aren't needed and so it is ok to ban them, I recommend that you give it a little thought. The next step is to ban anything other than single shot rifles. The bans will creep on to all guns, including self defense hand guns.|`|rephaDjLaa	I don't have a problem with that.<br>  <br>  You want to have a gun? Have a gun.<br>  You want to go hunting?

rXN2pT5Yaa	I would say it depends on an immigration officer. I was told to file a K1 visa because it would be faster. Actually it took about 7 months to get a NOA1 and the whole process took about a year. I would say getting married first will be faster. But, again, I know some folks who went through a super long process to be approved. You can go to visajourney.com<br>  and see how long the process it will take.

Secondly, although it has not been established in law that Ahmed's texting was the cause of him being unable to avoid the crashed car and driver he has done the honourable thing and pleaded guilty.

rHwE5Rkbaa	The IS rating is new to the Coast Guard, being only a couple of years old.  There is presently a 6-12 month wait for IS A-School, so you would be in the Coast Guard anywhere from eight to 20 months, depending at which pay-grade you enlist.  If you enlist as an E-1, you will graduate Boot Camp as an E-2.  Once you are an E-2, you have to hold the rate for six months to make E-3 - which is pretty much guaranteed unless you REALLY screw up.<br>  <br>  Once you make E-3, you can put your name on an A-School list - and then it is just a waiting game until you go to A-School - that's when the 6-12 months kick in.  Upon graduation of A-School, you will be advanced to PO3 and go to your next unit.<br>  <br>  If you enlist as an E-3, you can put your name on the A-School list as soon as you hit your first unit (right after Boot Camp).|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	Check out www.uscg.mil for info about who we are. . . <br>  <br>  If you want to know about the wait to get into the IS rating, you<br>  can check out <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/cgpc/epm/docs/A-SchoolList.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscg.mil/cgpc/epm/docs/A-Scho...</a><br>  and look at the 4th page or so where it lists the schools, their projected<br>  wait times, and the upcoming convenings.

Once Harriet Lane was called First Lady, the term was applied retroactively to her predecessors.|`|rephaDjLaa	Actually, the term was first applied to the niece, Harriet Lane, of  President James, who was a bachelor. A reporter wrote of her in the paper and called her the "First Lady" and after that the phrase stuck.
93M8Vccvaa	It's a matter of personal preference, plain and simple. Some agencies, like the Texas Dept. of Public Safety, do not allow any facial hair.|`|AA12334405	So when they eat powdered doughnuts......they can save some in there for later...:))|`|HGTGf3dpaa	I think its because some guys are attached to their facial hair... i.e. at my job managment changed the rule about males wearing beards and goatees - now they could only have trimmed moustaches... some quit because theydidn't want to shave their beards, and some cut it down to the moustache and they totally looked like cops. It was kinda funny, this one guy after we joked him about looking like a cop shaved it all off - (we would call him officer)but it made him look 17 - he's 29.... so he grew the stache back and kept ever since... hmmm maybe its about looking older?|`|v42nC3F2aa	So they can store small pieces of donut for later consumption.

9VRwBeATaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Before actually joining you participate in a test that will test your basic mental ability. Nobody can really fail this written test, it's just to see where you will fit in. After this you get sent off to a training camp for a couple of days. This is where your fitness will be tested. The training isn't hard. I suggest you start exercising before applying though.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	The majority of your training will depend on the trade of reserves you join. Also you will not be able to deploy to Afghanistan until you are 18, which is after 2011 and the current end of our combat commitment.

Listen, teamwork, being fast, are the keys that will get you though the course. if your slow (ie.walking to the washroom) can also get you yelled at too.<br>  <br>  what ever you do, go for BMQ first and then go for your SQ (summer course) just so you can see how it is first, if you like it continue it in the summer with the trade you pick (infantry, heavy artillery, weapons tech. etc.) oh yeah, dont be nervous too, that will also get you in ****

I made some edits for you with regard to capitalization, etc [See Below].  This is a powerful letter and I would encourage you to call his office as well to make sure that you get a response.<br>  <br>  Rep. Udall's office: (202) 224-5941<br>  <br>  Dear Mr.Udall,<br>  It felt strange selecting a prefix to write to you at the age of fourteen, so please exscuse the misspelling's below. last year i sent you a letter that i never recived a response to. It was regarding the genocide in Darfur. Yes, i called it genocide, even though the supreme court of the united states might disagree. In america, experiencing the freedom and paradise of the american dream it is hard to think about the wrong doings going on over there. So mr. Udall I want you to think about what it would be like to be in darfur right now. Your town, your home that you grew up in your whole life - ransacked. burned to the ground. the women in your town raped then killed. Your men simply killed. <br>  Now I wont bore you with facts like 70,000 dead in a 7 month period - 7 months out of a 26 month conflict. Now sir I am doing the best I can right now. And at the age of fourteen it's more convenient to think aobut the girls that might like me, or the girls that i like. But I'm thinking aobut Darfur. This is the best I can do short of flying over to Darfur and helping my self. But at the age of fourteen I can't do that. I cant and if i could i would. But you Mr. Udall and to anyone who you show this letter too you have the power. You can make a bill. You can propose to congress, and if you can't america deserves better, Darfur deserves better. These people need help. You probably get zillions of e-mails and letters a day dealing with the misplaced stop signs and people complaining about the stimulous bill. So Mr. Mark Udall member of the United States Senate and a man with the power to change the lives of the people of Darfur, I ask you sir; I ask you to help change the world. Now might not be the most convient time with the economic stimulus taking place and such. We need to take care of our own country first. blah blah. These people are dying Mr. Udall and I need your help to change the World.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	To get ready for a debate on this topic the best place to start is at <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article....</a>  It has links to both sides (click on curriculum) and is easy to navigate.<br>  <br>  However, any system devised by human beings is guaranteed to make mistakes. And the mistakes of this system are not reversible. With 130 wrongfully convicted people sentenced to death and an appeals system which is not set up to take a look at whether someone on death row was factually innocent....you can finish the sentence yourself.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Nope|`|5d9pCmjyaa	The death penalty holds a prominent place in the perfect legal system.<br>  <br>  But our legal system is far from perfect.  So far from perfect that I cannot support the death penalty.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Nah, I would rather see them rot in a cell. Death is too easy. Besides it cost too much to kill them. The average cost of all the appeals is 7 million and life in prison of an average of 25 years is less than half a million. It is fiscally bad and also not our job to execute as God is against it. And if there was one innocent killed--I do not care if it was before 1976, then it is just not worth it.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Yes.  But I'm lying.  I really don't approve.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	no because to take someone elses life is not the answer.....vengeance is mine sayith the lord......|`|74d0314d951419373b6d20225e56bf24aa	In some cases, yes.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Yes I do and it should be done faster.  The huge cost of executing prisoners so often cited by opponents is primarily because of the extended time they spend in prison appealing convictions.  Soe have lasted twenty years or more.  Appeals should be limited and the sentence carried out in a timely manner.|`|rqTsfzVvaa	No. There have been too many questionable trials where someone innocent has been killed. Plus, if someone is a really horrible criminal, being in jail for the rest of your life (in my opinion) doesn't beat death by a long shot... especiall if it's 23hr solitary confinement.|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	That's not true - I have heard of numerous cases where DNA could have exonerated people. There is a school who works to free people based on DNA (U of Illinois maybe) that were wrongfully convicted. And guess what, if they're dead, how can they be pardoned? <br>  <br>  Besides, once the trials and appeals are through it actually costs less to imprison them for LIFE than it does to execute. <br>  <br>  so NO, not in favor. <br>  <br>  Besides it's barbaric and unbecoming of a nation such as the USA.|`|Fkvk49ngaa	sorry, but no. no body deserves to have their life taken from them. even if they committed the worst crime ever thinkable, they should pay for their crime while alive. death is too easy.|`|AA11423026	Yes, for serious crimes that have adverse consequences.|`|2ef2c0e844e19038f6a979bb78073d8daa	No, it's cheaper to keep them in jail for life and it's not a deterrent.|`|AA10447191	Yes.|`|hbUaDewPaa	I`m in favor yes.<br>  I`m in ontario canada, and I remember quite well a case a few years ago, I`m sure you have heard of it too.<br>  The Paul bernardo case sickens me everytime I see Karla homolka in the news, she as far as I`m concerned should`ve never seen the light of day again.<br>  The part that bothers me is that she killed her own sister and only served 12 years.<br>  yet the victims they are dead.<br>  eye for an eye is my motto|`|80Dyljhdaa	No...Death is too easy a punishment for the people that get the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Living like an animal in a cage is punishment.|`|AA11217712	The death penalty is a barbaric punishment that equals murder....it had never deterred a muderer....<br>  I there not a better way to educate people to understand how to deal with others?|`|otKIUViRaa	Yes if they would actually carry out the sentence, but with appeals and lawyers it takes years sometimes to happen.<br>  They need to change laws to speed up the sentence if a person is guilty|`|vjfdhhSDaa	I approve of the death penalty <i only wish they would do it swiftly >instead of keeping them on death row for 20 plus years. they need to put in an express lane everywhere like Texas did.|`|R27yI1Foaa	Yes. Its like an eye for an eye kida.  Theyve broke the law and should be punished.|`|YFzprqqgaa	absosmurfly!  I think it should apply to child molestation and drunk driving also.|`|pmthGdolaa	Yes, that's their consequence for their actions.|`|EubHWGfOaa	yes...i actually do because if a person murders someone, then they deserve to die...yea i say yes|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	Ok, yes. Are you happy?|`|sE2RH0A7aa	Well, Yeah..<br>  We must get rid of all the baddies :]<br>  <br>  KIDDING JUST KIDDING. Only if they kill someone..

5IWzBf1eaa	a decision might be made that might not be in your favor. But that can happen with any system.  A pro would be "apparent" fairness.  You may propose this awesome idea, but the 9 other members might think that it is worthless.  Where as if you are the singular one in power, you make all of the decisions.  Checks & Balances also prevents a monarch or a dictator.
DFJ9m4WKaa	It originally became illegal due to racist immigration laws in the 30's that were eventually ruled unconstitutional. It was also wrongfully demonize by government propaganda and films like Reefer Madness that and it was though to make "the black man go crazy and threaten white women by rape" - similar to cocaine.<br>  <br>  With racial stigmas and the thought that pot is worse for you than alcohol or tobacco it was eventually listed with dozens of other drugs as illegal in the controlled substances act of 1970. Which at the time made since because Nixon was waging his war on drugs and marijuana was one of the Chief sources of income for drug cartels. So by making it illegal it gave them one more reason to arrest people suspected of being involved with drug cartels.<br>  <br>  But today we are faced by far worse drugs - crack, crystal meth, heroin, PCP, illegal prescription medication that can all be deadly. Newer drugs are also on the rise. Personally I do not have a good reason why marijuana should be illegal. I think what people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business.|`|7u7FSlRZaa	So they have one more reason to arrest people.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	Because it's dangerous. Booze and tobacco should be illegal as well.|`|hkSJSW55aa	That wont legalize it because we can grow it and they cant tax it|`|HzjeKsDJaa	my opinion is its too easy to grow, so the government can't really tax it, like alcohol|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	cause the goverment cant make money off it if it was legal

Looking at whitehouse.gov, it sounds like the McCain and group discussion a couple years ago.  Border security, enforcement against employers, procedure to register and get to back of the line, while giving preference to keeping families together.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, we give serious attention to finishing the fence, increasing use of the surveillance system used in AZ with great results, and an increased effort, including National Guard (with bullets) to take on the drug and coyote traffic and border violence. This is a National Security issue.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Bush and McCain and Now Obama have the same plan<br>  <br>  Leave them alone and they will go home wagging their tales behind them.|`|u9EsbutJaa	none because he might get deported under new rules if he passed them|`|lpwcqkNbaa	The same plans Bush had|`|4nmLPk44aa	Oh I suppose he is gonna keep em, and we are all gonna pay for em!! now isn't that just the nicest thing of all, We will go with out, while supporting people who have not contributed one dam dime to this country, Gosh that's just so neat!!!!!@#$#@!@!#|`|fEyuafVNaa	He plans to have illegal immigrants take over your homes and jobs in exchange for them taking a blood oath to worship at the Democrat alter.|`|4sK8MrDoaa	Illegal immigrants I presumed you're talking about.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	I'm guessing you mean you wish to fly for the USAF or USN.<br>  Great, I was also fired up to do so about your age.<br>  You've already got a good start CAP is VERY positive on an Academy or ROTC Scholarship application.  Also looks good on your SUPT application too.<br>  You're old enough to start ground school and flying lessons (as I'm sure your CAP members have probably told you.)  Civilian flying experience is HUGE-even if you don't get a PPL, a student license, glider license, loggable student time-all are helpful.<br>  Basic stuff to prep:<br>  - GPA.  Get that GPA as high as your reasonably are able.  Try to get some honors/AP classes too, especially if you're trying for the academy or a 4yr ROTC scholarship.<br>  - Sports. ANYTHING even intermurals is good.  Varsity would be better.  Get/stay in great shape-military flying is mentally and physically demanding.<br>  - Activities:  you've nailed one, consider JROTC if your school has one.  Student Gov't even being an officer in a student club is good. Shows you're well-rounded and have some leadership and initiative.<br>  - Stay out of trouble.  I'm sure you're all over this-as are Mom and Dad, but sometimes we get caught up in the moment, if you know what I mean.  Don't let felons or drug users fly multi-million dollar aircraft.  Right now it's VERY tough even to enlist in the AF with any sort of criminal record-as some of the questions asked in this forum will show.<br>  - Read up on military history, aviation in general, and military aviation.  Get up to speed on the USAF (and USN if you're considering that) inventory, missions etc; CAP can help there.  Pay attention in Social Studies: you WILL be interviewed about your knowledge of current events in your Academy/ROTC scholarship interviews.  <br>  Hope that helps, if you or your folks have questions about how pilot training works, please PM me.|`|BC3ArPKxaa	You must be at least 17.

Without a pardon the felony conviction is likely to lead directly to his deportation and ban from returning for a minimum of 10 years, if not for the rest of his life.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Conviction of felony = deportation as unfit for citizenship.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	It was a good speech. not great, but good. What made is shine really was Bobby Jindals response which was like saying: We Republicans have an offer you can't refuse of a brand new set of wet dish rags we would like to sell you and we'll include a genuine imitation leatherette carrying case if you act right now or one of these days if you feel like waiting<br>  His speech wasn't anything I'll write home about. I'm a Democrat and have written much more on Jindals lack luster speech than Obama's pretty good speech.<br>  That's a paradox of politics. When Republicans were sweeping things Democrats put up responses much the same...wet dish rag writers and wet dish rag speakers. It's typical of American politics when one party gets a strong majority.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Yes it was a very good speech but really said nothing that he has not said countless times on the campaign.  Campaign is over and would rather have heard what is he doing or planning to do rather then it is Bush's fault and hope and change; elections over.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	he is a typical feel good politician with no concrete solutions.|`|Hf8DlmLqaa	Nope. He need to quit speaking because every time he does my stocks drop.
D81XrnY9aa	Yes, once your Active Duty enlistment is up, you can go to the Reserves/Guard. All of your active points will transfer to your reserve retirement. Many G/R members are former active-duty and go this route. Do not throw out the idea of joining the ANG right away as you can keep your good job you have now, stay close to home, and still get the exact same training as you would have going AD. Look into it, but either way, you are going in for the right reasons and I respect that.<br>  email me for more questions, glad to help you.|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	You have a great job and yet you still want to work in an area where you risk your life?<br>  Reserves doesn't sound good - seems risky<br>  Air Force - That requires a hell lotta mentalilty and skills

They might have to put me in the mental ward eventually.  And this is honestly the truth!  Unless of course they medicate me, then I'm screwed and will have to be very careful about making the right kinds of friends, get the right work permits, stuff my locker full of the mackerel or whatever else they're using as prison money these days... and keep close track of my personal items, including underwear, socks, razors, combs, toothbrush and toothpaste, etc.  And protect my but and front area (I'm a woman).

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	I know you don't want to tell your family as you are afraid you will lose them but you won't.  Believe me, your family love you and they would want to know!<br>  <br>  There are three issues here.  One, you need to get help so the abuse stops and so that you can get therapy to help you get over it.  Secondly, your brother is a pedophile and he needs to get professional help (as well as be punished for his crime) so that he won't do something worse to someone else when you grow too old for him to continue to molest.  Thirdly, you need to be strong for yourself and for others....you deserve justice...and you need to stop him so he doesn't molest anyone else!<br>  <br>  Please tell...and if you can't tell your family, tell your doctor or your teacher.

wgaC4Fyiaa	I have lived and studied in  Latin America and also visited/studied in Spain, Italy and Portugal, and honestly I must admit that Americans from the USA are the most unhappy people as a whole. <br>  <br>  People in Latin America, if they are not of the upper class are dirt poor but they live day by day and appreciate what they have. This kind of adaptation also keeps them from rising up because they always find a way to make do, but in my experience they are much happier with much less than what even the poorest American's have. (Not including the homeless). <br>  <br>  In my experience in Spain and Italy especially, the people were not necessarily as wealthy as the average American--they had less material wealth, but they worked shorter days, have longer vacations (six weeks per year) and also siestas. They take 1-2 hours off for lunch and the day is just more pleasant. They live in the moment as well.<br>  <br>  Here in the USA many of us (not all) are consumed with making money, working and making more money and what the Joneses have and what we don't have and what we need to buy. We are scheduled down to the minute with to-do lists and always looking ahead and not living in the moment. We try to control everything and when we cannot we get stressed out and upset. In other cultures it is more "live and let live" and they go with the flow rather than trying to control everything so there is less stress in their daily lives, making them happier.<br>  <br>  Also, another generalization, but it has some truth, these other cultures value family and friendships more. Here money,work, things and appearance tend to be more important than family and friends.|`|PxXS7Gm6aa	First of all, not everyone from the south is poor and with the large cities in the north i am sure the numbers might even be higher up there.

The agreement was forced on the new Cuban government through the Platt Amendment, which gave the U.S. authority to interfere in Cuban affairs.<br>  <br>  The Lease Agreement signed on February 16 1903, granted the U.S. "the right to use and occupy the waters adjacent to said areas of land and water… and generally to do any and all things necessary to fit the premises for use as coaling or naval stations only, and for no other purpose."<br>  <br>  On July 2 1906, (just before the 2nd U.S. military intervention) a new lease was signed in Havana for Guantánamo Bay and Bahía Honda, for which the U.S. would pay $2,000 per year.<br>  <br>  The U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, the oldest existing U.S. military base outside U.S. territory, sits on a 45-square-mile area (117.6 square kilometers) about the size of Manhattan Island.|`|AA11858035	We don't occupy it, we lease it.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	Billy missed 2 important events'<br>  <br>  In 1934 the lease was changed to esculating payments and the requirement that both parties agree to the US leaving.

gasquENMaa	I call this a crystal ball question. No information is given on the priors or the current (felony) charges and an opinion is being asked about leniency or sentencing.<br>  <br>  Given no info, best thoughts is to discuss this with a good legal defense attorney. <br>  <br>  Past priors will count against her. If they are related to the current double non-violent felonies, the Judge is going to see this as graduating from the minor leagues to the majors.<br>  <br>  Length of time between commissions will be examined. A current history of 5 convictions over 2 years is far worse than  5 convictions over 27 years, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  To answer your specific question, anything is possible in a court of law when you have the right defense counsel. I use the original OJ  murder trial as my example. <br>  <br>  Considering you are discussing two felonies, I would suggest good legal defense to minimize the sentencing in this.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you

XyXDs8vcaa	My friend, you are giving people too much credit. If anything, most people in my experience drive even worse when I am behind them. People also have different definitions of "full stop". A full stop is when brakes are applied and all 4 wheels completely stop rotating, not creeping up to the stop sign while looking both ways and then taking off.

The biggest question I would have is why the cop didn't write you a ticket for failure to stop.  Since he didn't, he had no probable cause to stop you.  He had no probable cause to give you a breathalyzer, either.  Check to see if suspicion of violating your license restriction is a primary or secondary cause to pull you over.  He can only pull you over for a primary cause, not a secondary.  Ex.  Some states have a seat belt law that is secondary.  That is, you can't be pulled over for a seat belt violation.  But, if you had a burned out tail light, then you could be cited for both (light & belt).  States are  different, so be careful.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Usually I do not answer 3 days old questions but here a good answer seems not have to be given.<br>  <br>  The U.S. Green Card does not count for travel to Europe. It just depends on your citizenship whether you will need a visa. We have two travel areas in Europe. One is called the Common Travel Area (CTA) which consits of the countries Ireland and the United Kingdom. The other travel zone called Schengen area contains of Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Both travel zones have common entry requirements.<br>  <br>  To travel to the United Kingdom or Ireland visa free you must hold a passport of Andorra, Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Dominica, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Kiribati, Korea (Republic of), Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Micronesia, Monaco, Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Santa Lucia, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, USA, Uruguay, Vatican City, Vanuatu, and Venezuela (with machine readable passport only).<br>  <br>  To travel to the countries of the Schengen area as tourist for up to 90 days in a six months period you need to have a passport of Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), Iceland, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Macao (SAR), Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, Vatican City, and Venezuela.<br>  <br>  If your country should not be named you will need a visa to travel to Europe without having undergone the naturialization process to become a U.S. citizen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/doineedvisa/visadatvnationals" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/doineedvisa...</a><br>  <a href="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/home/index.aspx?id=8777" rel="nofollow">http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/home/index....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/WillkommeninD/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/StaatenlisteVisumpflicht.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/...</a>|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	If you would normally need a visa then you will still need a visa.  Having a Green Card will not assist you with travel to Europe.|`|ffHcbUeLaa	It depends on your citizenship status - whether with your current passport you can enter that country in Europe.  Permanent residency does not matter, only your passport counts, so you should check with the embassy of your country of citizenship as to what the requirements are.  Also remember that you cannot travel internationally without a passport, so you do not have one now, you need to obtain it from the embassy of your country of citizenship prior to making arrangements - you cannot enter other countries just showing a green card.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider becoming a US citizen since you are likely eligible, and then you will be able to travel likely to more countries in the world with the US passport.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Your residence is irrelevant. What matters is what country issued your passport. You need to consult the web site of the embassy of the country in Europe that you wish to visit. Check to see if a visa is required for citizens of the country that issued your passport.|`|QJ7ogJloaa	if your traveling, you would just need a passport because you are not deciding to live there for any amount of time. you only need the visa for that.|`|ckuhgjWGaa	Not unless you're trying to get a job in Europe.  You should be fine with a passport.|`|XlRC5NFdaa	the permanent resident card is only needed to enter the United States, you would need to see if the country you intend to visit allows you only to enter with the passport of your country only. But you need for sure your passport.

3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	One time not long ago an insufferable liberal came to our house and started running his mouth about the war.  I got angry, so I made up this story about Bush, Clinton and weapons.  The story started taking on a life of its own, and when I got done "explaining" the politics about the war Mr. Uninformed said, "You know, I read about that too."  THEN, he started telling me other facts about the situation I had just made up and about how the Democrats were going to fix it.  I had to excuse myself and go upstairs because I thought holding in my laughter would give me a hernia.  My husband thinks I'm desperately wicked.  (This is one of his friends I'm talking about.)  I told him I'd rather be mean than stupid as a stump.  So you don't need a shrink.  You just need to have a little fun at their expense and you'll feel a lot better.

I do not believe the US government would declare bankruptcy, since the debt is just on the books, but one day it will have to be paid back, and I think we will all remember the Obama administration as one that got us there.<br>  <br>  I never voted for him and was surprised that he was able to fool so many.  But considering that we have an expanding pool of "entitlement" in this country, people on welfare, food stamps, etc., that actually do not contribute to tax revenue and do not work as hard as the rest of us, I think they would vote for anyone that would keep their status quo and keep their free money coming - until we run out of people that actually contribute to tax revenue and then they all have to go back to work.|`|JNxD7URsaa	UH<<<< Don't you mean NOW that the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy DUE to the Bush Administration and the inept management of  America's business,, What will happen if Obama CAN"T save America since it might be too late ??

J"|`|E9Z41ikJaa	I believe he's trying to remake the idea of what the USA is. It is certainly not unprecedented for leaders to stimulate a decline in order to concentrate power... sometimes they are convinced that is good for a nation because they believe they can run things better.<br>  <br>  But, in the end, once you create positions of power, people who seek power for their own ends get into those positions and things turn out worse.<br>  <br>  Civilizations fail, and perhaps the USA will. Greece, Rome, the Turks, the British... all great empires seem to get bloated in their prosperity and lose the values that made them great. They collapse on themselves.<br>  <br>  Not very uplifting, but based on historical trends from other countries, we're probably just about on schedule. 200-400 years.|`|1NPKAKk7aa	When obama throws this country into bankrupcy... hopefully he will get impeached and someone that has common sense instead of radical ideas will replace him.

eOVBmibIaa	First off, we never should have been in Iraq. Bush fed us lies about there being W.M.D's and that Hussein was a member of Al-Queda. The only reason it would we invaded is because congress was controlled by Republicans and everyone was worshiping Bush because of Afghanistan. Also, we wanted there oil. It would have been a hell of a lot easier to find new energies in alternatives but conservatives are just too damn scared of moving on. What we should be doing is piling through Afghanistan to find Bin Laden so we can bring him to justice!|`|PKzE3AVBaa	I believe the constitution states that only congress shall declare war.

Yet there has already been a tax hike on the poorer class in the form of a tobacco tax. True this will only effect those who use tobacco, but a tax is a tax. <br>  He has said that he will have the deficit paid down drastically by 2010, but to do that the economists say that he will have to raise taxes across the board by 80% to do that.<br>  The money he wants to redistribute is that of the working man, the blue collar worker and lower management.

Anybody who knows anything about guns knows that the label  "assault weapon" refers the cosmetic aspect of the weapon. All guns are assault weapons if they used as such. Just today I heard interviews with people in Philadelphia blaming the NRA for a cop getting shot. I give it 20 to 1 odds that the weapon used in the crime was not owned legally. The NRA didn't shoot the cop, and the gun didn't shoot the cop, A criminal did.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	You are preaching to the choir here my man , but preach on , you are 100% correct .|`|XD42367paa	An assault weapons ban is feel good legislation that really does nothing about making anything safer for anyone.

They knew it, he knew it, he knew they knew it.  A lot of money will be spread around to keep as many people working as possible.  Some of these government buck will be 'wasted', but the money isn't going to vanish into thin air.  ALL of it will be respent and that's what will 'stimulate' more private spending...which is the object of the exercise.  The GOP may actually believe that government dollars, once spent, ceases to exist.  Anyone who lives near a major military base knows different.  On the first and the fifteenth when the troopers get paid all the nearby business go into overdrive.  They stock up on stuff to sell...and somewhere, someone has to produce the stuff they sell.  Aggreate demand and the velocity of money is the key.  Tonight I heard one of those right wing talk show dummies going on about how 'government' doesn't 'create' jobs...what a pile!  Government money, like any kind of money, creates demand and demand is what creates jobs.  That's why this 'stimulus' will work.  Everyday 'stuff' wears out and eventually has to be replaced.  People who have jobs will buy 'stuff' and the buying will create a venue for production and more jobs etc.  If Jindal and the GOP don't understand that something is radically wrong with those people.  If they DO understand it and are simply jiving the public then there's something even more radically wrong with those people.  That scares me!

A kennel is any place with more than 3 dogs. However, a non-commercial owner can get a permit to have more than 3 dogs from the Health Officer, and will not be classified as a kennel.  So if the property owner wants more than 3 dogs on the property, he must apply for such a permit.<br>  <br>  However, this does not apply if you are in a city, which your question seems to indicate.  If you are, what city is it?|`|TSc8OE4vaa	It differs by county.  Cities allow more, country spaces allow less.

Even law enforcement officers will use several other resources before resorting to deadly force.<br>  <br>  Remember also that when making a citizens arrest the local authorities will act on your behalf but it will be you (the one making the arrest) that will have to defend your actions in court.

Stick to your story so the ahole cant sue ya.|`|Ak35Y562aa	As long as you dont live in DC or New York.<br>  <br>  YES, technically it's legal to pull a gun on someone thats ON OR IN YOUR AREA OF DWELLING...including yard or woods.<br>  <br>  You legally CANT shoot him unless he charges at you or pulls out a weapon and attempts to attack.<br>  (although in texas and florida, they have big time Castle Doctrine, so i believe you CAN actually shoot someone thats on your property for possibily threatening or risky reasons.....it's reffered to the "shoot first, ask questions later law" )<br>  <br>  <br>  But YES for a short answer, you can pull a gun.<br>  I would recommend doing so(as long as the gun is legally owned by you and your of legal age)<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't depend on the police to do anything or get there on time.<br>  <br>  When seconds count, the police are only minutes away!<br>  <br>  Nothing against the police, however they dont EVER take theft seriously, and they cant for good reason...theres just TOO MANY cases of them going on, they cant keep up and follow investigations over $200 of stolen items or damage....its just a waste of police resources....and IF they catch him, then they have to spend more state money putting charges on him and taking it to court...then when they get a GUILTY verdict......big deal, 99% of misdemeanors only carry a couple months in jail to 1 year at the most.....or even just pay a fine!<br>  And he'll be right back out on the streets again doing what he's best at....<br>  <br>  <br>  Depend on YOU for personal safety, not others.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could always rig a booby trap or shock-device into the stereo or shell of the car.....however that could bring big legal problems....however its VERY unlikely that would happen.....<br>  Criminals never sue, they simply dont have the money, which is why they are stealing in the first place!<br>  And you CANT PROVE he got injured from a shocking device, since electrical shocks DONT leave burn marks....even with 500,000 volt stun guns.|`|fRQHpKCPaa	Check your state laws you could get in alot of trouble in some states that look down on gun ownership. You may even be outgunned and outnumbered if you do confront someone. In many anti-gun states you must have sinage (yea sounds crazy but true). Your better off with a proximity alarm on your car and a hidden camera. A dog would help too, now mind you these are just deterants. *Good luck*|`|sqjlQ6K8aa	Illegal no . . . stupid yes.<br>  <br>  The fact that you even have to ask this question gives me reason for concern. It would appear that you have a gun in the house but lack the judgement required to use it. <br>  <br>  You should never point a weapon at someone unless you intend to use it and the last time I checked no vehicle is worth a life - yours or the bad guys.|`|NCzNtR8Gaa	Criminals are dangerous.  Leave it to the professionals, call the police.
