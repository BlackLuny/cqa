20080705222135AA6QnZ0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Baby Girl's Name?	So, I know that I already posted this question, but the way it was phrases might not get as many respones.   Anyways:   We are in the process of adopting a beautiful baby girl from Vietnam.  The first name she was given at birth was Hua. We intend to keep that as part of her adoptive name. However, with her first name, we have two names that we love:   Catina Belle-Hua   or   Talia Christine-Hua/ Talia Odette-Hua      I love Talia, but I don't know if it will fit her as well.

20080926005039AAM2TQ6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC - Will this affect my chances of conceiving this month??? Advice please.?	I know this sounds like a silly question - but I don't want to do anything to get in the way of my chances of conceiving this month.      I am due to take part in a karate tournament around about the day I am due to ovulate.    Do you think this will affect my chances of conceiving in any way? I mean because of all the jumping around and physical exertion, as if it is then I will make up an excuse and get out of it. At the moment I really don't know what to do, as I was looking fwd to the tournament until I calculated my dates. But now I am in two minds, as I don't want this month to be wasted because of the tournament.      What do you think? Any advice or opinions would be helpful.
20080930094631AA2Z9eK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC. Will this ruin my chances this month?	Ok so here my situation - I got a positive on my ovulation test yesterday, so down to business now!.    Anyway, my problem is that I have a karate tournament on Sunday - which is going to fall right in the middle of my 2ww!       Do you think that if I have conceived this month (i.e. yesterday/today!) then doing a karate tournament will ruin my chances of the egg implanting?? I'm just a bit worried that if the tournament is quite physically demanding, then maybe this can't be good for the egg and it wont want to stick around :o(      Any opinions or advice would be welcomed please, as currently I'm really not sure what to do. I just don't want to do anything that might cause the egg to not implant, or for anything to go wrong because of the tournament (I'd rather drop out of the tournament)      Thanks in advance

20081001202958AAL3Fuc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Would you be ok with your teenage son wearing make up?	I'm 15 & want to start wearing makeup not to look like a chick or anything just to look like a hotter guy. I know sexuality is going to come up so I'll say it now; I'm bi. Haven't told parents yet though so if I ask they'll probably suspect.       Some guys are blessed with perfect skin but I wasn't and I want it and the girls in my area pay more attention to guys who have nice skin and no dark circles. Same for guys; and I always feel ugly compared to other guys because my skin isn't up to par.      I've been trying for YEARS to get my face to a point where I'm satisfied (3.5 to be specific) and I think make up could solve the problem.      Just foundation and powder. And I would go to the MAC counter to make sure I get the right colors.      Would you be bothered by that?      I think I'll "come out" so to speak and then ask my parents to buy it for me around Christmas or something.
20081105121516AA0TS7i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do any other people feel this way?	I'm 19 and I feel I don't want to waste time in relationships if I don't think I'm going to with the guy for the rest of my life. My last relationship lasted 2 weeks and I just blew off this guy who really likes me. But what I want to know is, is it normal to not want to be in a relationship? And if so does anyone else feel the same way?      Please don't criticize I just want to know if this is normal... I see so many couples who don't stand a chance of being together a long time and end up getting hurt and I don't want to be like that.

20081020024007AAL4Uhs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Bleeding at 3 weeks pregnant?	I'm only 3 weeks pregnant but started bleeding yesterday. It was pinkish/brown to start with but seems to be a bit more red today. I'm not having any cramps or pain, and I feel ok apart from the bleeding - so I have just been resting since it started as I don't know what else to do. I'm just so sad and disapointed!      I don't think there is any point in going to the Dr's as it's so early in my pregnancy, I think they'd probably just tell me to rest, which I already am.      Has this happened to anyone else?    What else can I do to try and save my pregnancy????

20070612080706AAJ7Jke	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My parents and self esteem?	My parents make me feel horrible about myself, they don't mean to I know but they do. In general I'm a very guilty person so to make me feel better about myself I like to do things around the house. SO when theyre not home I do all sorts of things like laundry and cleaning and it makes me feel like I can do something on my own. But when my mom is home she just completely takes over. And she just meddles in everything, even the most personal things all the time, which makes me feel worthless like I can't do anything on my own, and she and my dad they just push and push until they get what they want. Theyve never wanted to accept the fact that I grow up, no matter what I do to show them they don't want that. They didnt let me work until i was 18 and did everything they could to discourage me.       I work as much as I can and as soon as I make enough money to get a place I'm gone and obviously I respect their rules and do what they ask but is there anything I can do until then?

The other day I had an ultrasound and they only picked up one heart rate at 160. one of my friend who is a twin said that they told his mother the same thing and there was two of them. That however was 24 years ago and I know technology has advanced I just wanna know if there is still a chance that their are two or if I can go ahead and prepare myself for just one.

But when she reach 4months she became so fussy with other people at first was good but after 10-15minutes she start to cry.

He has had 5 ear infections and the doctor said that it just takes 10 minutes for them to place the tubes but he didn't say low long the recovery time was.

I don't think the doctor mention this but I was wondering if it was true and how long did your infant stay in the hospital after having tubes placed.
20090203090045AA2CdO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I have a formula question? ?	I am a nanny for 11 month old twins. Yesterday I asked the Dad (he is the one I deal with mostly, drop off and pick up) if and when they wanted to start weaning them from formula to whole milk. He said that his wife had already started by diluting their formula. Like to make 8oz, you are supposed to put 4 scoops in, she has been putting in 2. I have a daughter myself, its been a while since she was on formula (she mostly breastfed until I weaned her to whole milk) but I'm pretty sure the doctor told me to never dilute her formula when I did give it to her. What is the best way to wean children off formula and onto whole milk? Any suggestion on how to suggest this to the parents?
20090203091005AAjO4Gh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Ex-crush help?	I like a guy last year and he flirted w/ me all year (but in really mean ways like stealing my stuff and making me ask him to have it back and sometimes hitting me, calling me a bi***, I called him a b****** back though.) So on the next to last day of school (last year) I asked the office where his class was and gave him a letter basically saying I want to be your friend, if you want to hang out w/ me this summer my number is (My cell number) he never called the entire summer and I haven't seen him whatsoever since that day. (It has been 8 months to the day since I gave him the letter and I can't stand it anymore!) I've heard from my friends that he still goes to my school though. Now that it's the second semester I see one of my ex-crush's friends in the hall every other day. (Let's call his friend Jason, not his real name either). "Jason" doesn't even say hi when I walk by, and give me a go to He** look every time I see him even though he was my friend in the class I had w/my ex crush and in theater arts. I was also friends with another girl from his class (lets call her Erin) Erin over the summer deleted me as a friend on MySpace and acts bitchy towards me every time I see her (even though she was nice all last year and we both even helped me on homework.. and tests.) I am considered the shy girl in all my classes, and I was always nice to everyone (especially all of them) so Idk. It has been depressing me to know that people I wanted so badly to be friends w/ would treat me like this, why they all apparently hate me for no obvious reason. I was wondering if anyone has any theories as to why (b/c I sure can't figure it out.) I'll give best answer!! =D

I thought due to this I probably missed the mark, however I have sore boobs on and off for the last 3 days, and mild cramping which today has got stronger. Most importantly I have a dull lower back ache that I have only ever had when I was pregnant.       AF due  7th/8th Feb, but I couldnt wait and knowing it was too sonn I have taken a test anyway which was BFN, but it is prob too early and wasn't with FMU.      I reaslise you cant give me the answer but what do you ladies think? Had anything similar happen? Are you in the TWW?
20090203085025AABeJ1w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Shower Before Or After Baby?	So i am due with baby number 2!       I am wondering about the new trend of baby showers after the baby is born?      I am usually very traditional but i like the Idea of introducing the baby to all of my family and friends.  I have very hard pregnancy's, i am usually wore out  and very sick the entire pregnancy.       Here are my concerns.      Shower before baby   I am not in the social mood   People usually do not show up   & after the baby is born people drop by uninvited.      After Baby   GERMS!   I am a germaphobe when it comes to my newborn!   I am also worried that all the guests will be over whelming to the baby and myself.      Its almost a 50/50 so do you guys have any thoughts on the ideas?      Has anyone had a shower after baby? How did it go?       All shower thoughts are welcome!

20090203085926AAdO9oS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What can I do if my sons circumcision healed wrong?	He is 3 months old now. But ever since day 1 after being circumcised I have pulled the extra skin back that was left for growing and cleaned around the base of the head. Now it seems that the skin has healed to the base of the head, and will not pull back any more. I let my husband decide if our son should be, or shouldn't be, because my husband isn't. He didn't want him feeling embarrassed because kids tease in school, and most boys are.    Now I feel like I may regret it. I know there is nothing I can do now! BUT I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if it has presented any problems. His doctor checks it every check-up and has never said a word about it.    You can see most of the head of the penis, its just the very bottom that isn't visible. Should I be worried, or will this fix itself in time?

20090203085745AAh1zBq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why am i puking? Labor soon?	On Friday Jan 30th I went into the hospital to be induced. They tried to induce me at first with a pill similar to cervadil, then again 6 hours later, and then 6 hours after that. This did not work at all, and they told me I had to be dilated at least a little more for the pitocin to work. I ended up back at home Sat night with no baby, in pain with cramping and Braxton Hix, and So frustrated!!!      I lost my mucous plug Sat. night, but nothing since then. I have a Dr's apt. today, and then will be induced again on Friday the 6th if I don't have the baby by then.      This morning I suddenly started puking. It was like a split second, I dont' feel good, then Puke. I keep puking a Ton. Does this mean anything? I don't have a cold or the flu or anything, I just suddenly cannot hold down water or anything.      I am only having the normal braxton hix, and no cramping, or anything like that. Any ideas what this means? Or does this just mean my tummy is tired of being pregnant ;-)

20090203090713AA75Fk8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Nervous mommy to be.?	Im about 9 and a half weeks pregnant. I originally saw a doctor who was very dismissive of my concerns and questions, so I went to Planned Parenthood. When I first found out I was pregnant I was considering abortion, and I made an appointment for an oral-abortion. But now because I am farther along then allowed for an oral abortion(since the original DR didn't do any tests) I would need a surgical abortion. Something I do not want to do. I didnt even want to have an oral one.      But my family is against me having this baby. And I don't want fear to be my reason for having an abortion. My mother continuously throws the yellow pages at me to find an abortion clinic. She does not ask how I feel, or really anything. My family is scaring me into not having this baby. Im so nervous and worried and I know this stress is not good for my baby.      I dont make a lot of money, but I support myself and rent an apt. with my boyfriend. He's on board although he admits he isnt ready. But how do I get ready. How do I tell my family that I will not have an abortion. That I have made my decision. How do I tell my boyfriend. Im afraid that he may resent me, that my family will be very unsupportive or that i'll be just like my own mother.      Im sorry for ranting. But how can I mentally prepare myself, Im very scared of having a baby from what's been screamed at me the past few days.       (It's really sad that I have to add this part because people do it way to often: Please don't bash me about abortion. And if you're only looking for two points find them elsewhere.)

I will be 18 and I told my mother I might be but she keeps denying it and then she yelled at me telling me that if I am she would kick me out and that I will have to live with my father. My father's house, I have nowhere to sleep let alone raise a kid. She isn't even trying to help all she keeps telling me that I'm not. I haven't had morning sickness yet, but on my menstuel I spotted the last day. Then my breasts were all tender my upper stomach is hard, my lower is sorta. I feel full and I'm having head aches.
20090203084924AAXfL3k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What can i do for a 3 month old baby who is sick?	Last night was the first night of my little girl being sick let me tell you I had a hard night:( I propped up her mattress to help her breath better but it didn't seem to help much. I finally picked her up went into the living-room and she feel asleep on my shoulder for about 3 hrs. The entire time I noticed that her body felt very warm so when she woke up about a half hr. later i took her temp and it was 101.4 gave her some meds and she passed out for another 1hr. this time i put her back in her crib. When she woke up this morning her fever was 101.9 gave her meds again a bottle and took all the nasty crap in her nose out to see if it would help with her breathing. I have no idea what else to do. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I am a lucky mom because ever since she was 2 months old she slept threw the night and last night was just very hard, for i am getting sick as well and my husband is sick. So any ideas would be great. I feel so bad for her.
20090203085125AAivboU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parenting Woes..please help?	A few years ago I legally adopted my grandson. My daughter decided that being a mother was not for her at that time. He has recently started 6th grade and I'm about ready to ship him off to military school. He doesn't obey me. For instance, I tell him to go to bed and then an hour later I find him playing his Nintendo DS in bed, this happens on a regular basis. He's had a couple of problems at school with play fighting that then goes a little too far. He doesn't do what I ask him to do most of the time....sometimes I have to ask him 3 or 4 times and then he will do it. He does have a temper that flares up from time to time when he doesn't get his way. I am 56 years old and I'm about done with him. Is it too much to ask that he make the right choices and do what I ask?   My other daughter tells me that these things are pretty typical of boys his age but I think that's just bull.   Any ideas? Please help me.
