20090227075622AAMbKxO	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	3000gt auto transmission not going/moving when in gear?	94 3kgt auto transmission.  Worked beautifully for a few months, then split the tire, so I had to let it sit for about a month while I got a new one, still starting it every few days though.  Finally got it up and went to drive it, it shifted kinda hard and went very slow in first gear (id have it at about 5 - 6,000 rpms just to keep up with accelerating traffic.  However when it got warm, it shifted like butter, as it used to.  Then this morning, I drove it, same problems but I figured they would go away after it got warm, but nothing.  Eventually i was on the side of the road flooring it and it budged a little bit but went nowhere.  R, N, D, 2, 1 all do the same thing, and Reverse doesnt even budge backwards, just forward.  When you shift, you feel a little jerk as if it was going into gear, but other things lead me to believe its not going into gear (i.e  the rpms don't drop for drive).  I have checked and rechecked the tranny fluid, it was never low, no puddles.  I heard that it could be the filter is plugged and the cold weather made the viscosity of the fluid too much for the filter to handle, but as it warmed up, the viscosity changed.  This gave me a glimmer of hope, because that is something i've done before and can do again.  So, any thing else I can look at or change while im down there, or any other suggestions as to what could cause this problem.  Sorry for the detailed explanation but I know some car guys prefer this. Thanks, any help is appreciated.

20090227080225AA1UnZV	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Why does my boyfriend feel entitled to my car?	He did n't help me pay a dime for it. I think one of the reason that he feels so entitled is because he watches the movie "Baby Boy" a lot. In that movie, the main character ALWAYS had the girlfriend's car, putting all that ghetto ish on her car like rims and tinted windows. He even talks about putting his organization sticker on it:( I just laugh along but this is MY FIRST CAR,and I don't want ANY stickers on it. It's a reason why men pay more, on average for car insurance. Most of them drive like they are NA SCAR drivers. We live together so I am working on getting my stuff together and moving out. I hate people with an undeserved sense of entitlement. He hasn't driven in five years. And flunked the written test. Never even held a permit. And feels entitled to drive. I just fell like he's keeping me around at this point for my car.       Keep the answers relevant:)   Thanks

The dealership said their is nothing more they can do.  I paid them $770.00 for nothing.  (Let me go into what is going on with the car)     It all started when it was ran out of gas, from then on it has been running real rich and getting approx. 9 MPG.  (Blowing Heavy Amounts of Black Smoke).  I took the car to the dealership and explained what was going on.  My car was in the shop for approx. 3 months when they called and said it was ready.  I Paid the above amount and drove the car about 30 miles when the same thing occured.  Took the car back, this time the car was at the dealership for 14 months.  I finally asked them to loan me a car, which they did.  But it wan't long and they had my car fixed, so they said.  I picked it up on 02/16/2007 and drove 60 miles.  same dame thing.  Now, the dealership told me they don't know what to do, they are out of options.  Can anyone give me some pointers here.      Thanks Marc.

C'est une différence de degré dans le masculin qui fait qu’un certain seuil de machisme est franchi et qui fait souvent toucher à l’insupportable dans le comportement envers les femmes. Il s'agit en fait d’une fixation enfantine de pulsions de possession, proche du désir de viol. C'est une dynamique spécifique qui semble se nouer chez le Slave entre le masculin et le narcissisme dans laquelle la motricité du désir passe par un désir d’emprise et un sadisme latent, lesquels interagissent pour constituer sa représentation virile. Il y a pour les hommes slaves un rapport particulier du fils à la mère, laquelle lui inculque dès l'enfance l’idée de la supériorité de sa race et dès lors que cette idée s’y enracine sa relation à l'autre ne peut être qu'un rapport de dominant à dominé. Ce désir de domination est tellement évident que la femme slave, annihilée, doit se soumettre ou psychiquement se dissoudre. Il est ici question d’une problématique narcissique dans l

20080326140957AAvU3sm	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Fuse for central locking system on Citroen Xsara?	My mum is having problems with the central locking on her Xsara (June 199 West coast 1.4 model).  She can lock three of the doors when she is in the car, manually, but as soon as she leans over to lock the passenger door manually, the system clicks twice, and everything comes unlocked. Similar problem if she is out of the car, using the key. The problem obviously lies with the passenger door. I have gone through previous Yahoo questions, tried the WD40 suggestions, but it hasn't solved the problem.  I see people talking about removing and replacing the fuse for the central locking system. But where is this located? And how difficult is it to change ?   Thanks in advance.

I'm 18 years old and I am looking to buy a car I have just recently finished high school early, so I could start working. But the thing is I live in a tiny town and they don't have any openings. I want to buy a car to work in a city about 39 miles away but I don't have a car!      I want a new car that won't break own on me, and one that I will enjoy for about 10 years.

Or how to even check how high it will be.      My point, I need to know what I should ask the dealer without sounding stupid, and I need to know some of these terms.   *Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price. Tax, title, license, dealer fees, APR* Thanks to anyone who can help me with this! I appreciate it!

Que opinais vosotros?
