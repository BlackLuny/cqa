Answers team themselves.<br>  <br>  It is believed that the first question ever asked on Yahoo! Answers had been deleted.<br>  <br>  The oldest question available now is this one ?

When an account is suspended, all Q & A associated with that account remain "out there"  (except those which were removed as viiolations, obviously).  If one or more questions you answered with your previous account had been in voting limbo all this time, and your answer was (finally!) chosen as BA by voters ... yep, that old account still receives credit for BA.<br>  <br>  Weird, huh?|`|O0Bzvjq8aa	Uh, no.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	There is always something going crazy with Y!A. From the site not working properly for hours, to points not changing no matter how many questions you reply to.|`|rytSFBbgaa	No it hasnt before
F49y3gImaa	Has it been blocked?<br>  My parents blocked mine when I was<br>  14 so I couldn't send or receive any.|`|LDWuRWTjaa	Parents probably taken it away. They can control it so you don't get any and can't send any.|`|mJaEsxwCaa	Maybe your bill isn't paid. That is what happened to me once. You might want to try deleting all the messages in the inbox and outbox.
f66a533a94a469e1944c3246ae9d43e6aa	I can pick up e-mails, but cannot send or respond. Instead get the "string of letters" and then deletes..I reported but no answered from Yahoo.<br>  Glad someone else is experiencing this problem|`|0MsfCOYKaa	I'm having the same sort of problems. I can get my email, but can't respond to or compose any new emails. When I try to empty my spam folder the messages don't go away until I open another folder. It all started a few days ago and is very annoying. I think it was around the time that stupid chat thing showed up. I even tried to upgrade to the new version, I still run yahoo classic, that didn't help at all. In fact I couldn't even get my inbox to show up. Again, this is VERY ANNOYING!|`|BLHOV22xaa	I have been getting errors for over a week now.  I finally got someone in chat last night and she said that they are working on fixing the problem.  They are supposed to have a system upgrade / fix on March 13th. I can try to wait until then but another week or so of this and I am moving to a different company.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I asked the online help tech if this had anything to do with them being stupid and adding Chat to Yahoo Classic and she said no.|`|rqDAktVtaa	Yes it started acting up about 2 weeks ago and getting worse.<br>  It is extremely frustrating.<br>  I am not impressed with the mail search function at all. It rarely finds emails that I "know" are in there. Seems to only go back a short time.<br>  I think my days with yahoo mail are coming to an end.|`|a3T3gfb1aa	Yes. Mine has been getting steadily worse for a week. I think I've sent in 100+ Error5 and Error14 messages. Can't open email, can't move messages around to folders, delete, etc. The online chat folks are swamped at certain times, which is a good sign, if they are listening. I'm sick of this crap but changing all my contacts to a Gmail account will be a drag, so I'm waiting a few more days. Now I know why it's called Yahell.|`|vEYCgNMbaa	I can't even get to "my yahoo" now! I googled "yahoo problems" and found your question in the search results. Oh and last night I couldn't get into my email either. So you aren't the only one! Yahoo!!!!  Hellooooooo!!!!! anybody out there???? grrr..|`|cevn4V11aa	I am having the same problem the yahoo home page comes up but when I sign in to check my mail it says page cannot be displayed.|`|qPAKpsG1aa	Yes, I'm having problems. My inbox and files won't open so I can't get to my emails. Same thing happened with me on the chatline.... I'm furious!!!!! Any suggestions|`|E0MGL9WQaa	I have not been able to access my yahoo e-mail since this afternoon (Pacific Time).  It just quit working.   Has your's come back on yet?

At least you've given someone out their their 2.5 second euphoria.
Xxviy63Paa	They aren't allowed to say anything else, or they'll be fired. That's the Big Corporation.<br>    They also mostly speak English as a second language, as Yahoo has outsourced most of its modding work to India and other countries. They'd have been bankrupt long ago otherwise, though they will eventually anyhow.<br>    I expect a lot of the modding is done by bots, too. That's why they have "top reporters" and reputation scores. Humans only look at issues if the bot's decision is challenged.
V03TQueoaa	No im not.You just have to go to "my page" on your 360 and go to edit personal photos.When you upload the videos click done.Once your done the pictures will arrive in your 360.When you click edit personal photos again you can set your primary photo.That will be the main picture.Also you can do the photo album.Then upload pictures there.Its not that hard :) oh and heres my 360 <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/my_profile-EsjpffE9cqqQDxvlv9F2UAp5i.2ZTAbcu.hGDupO;_ylt=AiP_.ETz2hRrRJL0LI8bO2m.AOJ3">http://360.yahoo.com/my_profile-EsjpffE9...</a> :)

L2tQ7t6Faa	You probably created your XBOX account off your yahoo email account.  The 360 is a computer and your console holds all your internet settings|`|7u77AiBjaa	You are using a Yahoo account to access various SERVICES like Yahoo! Messenger and Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://everything.yahoo.com">http://everything.yahoo.com</a> ). There tends to be features that link services together. There are two possibilities here (of which I think the second is most likely the case). You should probably do both:<br>  <br>  1) There may be a gleam symbol showing when your Yahoo! 360 space updates.

You can click the Messenger menu on the Y!Messenger main screen, choose "Privacy Options" and uncheck the "Allow plug-ins to set clickable status messages" option. Click the "Ok" button.<br>  <br>  2) You'll need to manage your Yahoo! Updates related to Yahoo! 360.

e494eb1e544153fbeed8117f34b95807aa	Yes if you delete them from your list & you are showing as 'online' you will show up as online for them. I have had it so that I look offline to some people & when I delete them from my list & log in as 'online' they they send me messages cuz they see I am on. So I started signing in as invisible for everyone & only marking "appear online' for those those I want to see me online.

You get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  Also, the reason a site goes on the top of a search engine is not because of its contents, but how many OTHER sites link to it. If your site is linked to by a lot of other sites, it will be found quickly. If not, then the bot sees it as a dead end and doesn't touch it.|`|3vH8gSNraa	sorry but i find that yahoo does a better job than the other two

19JRf8Cxaa	Yeah, I have an alias account that none of my friends know about and I really like having it because if I have any personal questions, I won't have to worry about my friends seeing it.

Sure. Many folks do. Is it allowed? Not really. But still, many do. The YA team says we are not allowed more than one account (to prevent cheating), but it used to be that we could have them, if we did not cheat, of course. So you can do it; but be careful, because if they think you are using it to cheat, you stand a chance of losing both accounts.
