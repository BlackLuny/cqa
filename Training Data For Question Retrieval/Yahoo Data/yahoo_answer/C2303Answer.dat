zZxX5PXBaa	It's the difference between the 'indicative' (will) and the 'subjunctive' (would). They're called 'moods' of a verb, as distinct from 'tenses' which are mainly to do with indicating past, present and future times.<br>  <br>  The basic idea is that in the indicative, this is just straightforwardly about what happens, or is going to happen. In the subjunctive, it's about what could happen, or might happen, or might even be impossible. There's a kind of 'what if?' quality about the situation, or 'wouldn't it be lovely' sort of wishful thinking.<br>  <br>  So, If I drop this egg, it will break on the floor.

These are simple stanzas, so they only have 'a' and 'b'.<br>  <br>  So the scheme simply lists 'a' and 'b' in the order they come up in. In this case it's 'a' for the first line, 'a' for the second, then 'b' for the third and the fourth.

The 'b' sound is 'ing' again.<br>  <br>  Usually you just quote the rhyme scheme for a single stanza, because usually the same rhyme scheme is used for each stanza, as here.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, though, you can quote a rhyme scheme for the whole poem... and here you can see that the 'b' sound in both the first and second stanzas is the same. In which case, just dealing with the first two stanzas ... you'd have a-a-b-b, c-c-b-b.

LeGhIETZaa	If you can afford it I say NYU. The fact that you received any scholarship you must have outstanding grades. Congrats! I've heard so many people talk about how NYU doesn't give them any financiall help. <br>  <br>  In my experience in the fieldl I have met way more graduates from NYU than Columbia. NYU will open up more connectionss in my opinion. Both schools are fantastic and are highly regarded. Live in a cheaper part of the city and buy a monthly metro card. The subway system can get you almost anywhere in the city in a short amount of time. Good luck and congrats again!|`|AA10023710	Columbia's graduate housing, if you need it, is apartments just off campus. They are very convenient to campus. You share them, usually, with just one other grad student, and you each have your own bedroom. It's a NY apt., so it's not huge, but it's big enough, and they aren't too run down or anything. For NY, I thought the apartments were actually pretty nice. I don't know about NYU's grad housing. <br>  <br>  In terms of non-university housing, Columbia is in a less expensive area of NYC than NYU is, and Columbia is accessible, by train or by foot, to several inexpensive (for NYC) neighborhoods, including Inwood, Harlem and Riverdale - all about 15 minutes or less by train. Of course, the apartments near NYU are nicer - it's a far posher neighborhood - but like you could afford them? :LOL: <br>  <br>  NYU is in a more hip part of NYC, but Columbia's neighborhood is Morningside Heights, which is very active and student-y. It's a mix of people who live in the neighborhood and nearby - who aren't super wealthy, but it's not a horrible neighborhood - and Columbia students. <br>  <br>  I'm actually more familiar with Columbia's neighborhood than with NYUs, because I used to live near Columbia, and I know a lot of former grad students from the school. I liked the area. It is bustling at all hours, which is actually a good thing, because it keeps it safe. There are a lot of nice restaurants there, casual places that are good for students, and not too expensive - for NYC :winks: It's an urban neighborhood, so as in any big urban area, you need to be aware of your surroundings. But it's not a bad area. <br>  <br>  Columbia has more of a "real college" feel to it, because it has an actual campus, with a quad and everything. NYU, as you noted, is more just a series of buildings in a neighborhood. Columbia's SW program is higher ranking than that of NYU, which could possibly help you in the future. If Columbia is also cheaper than NYU for you, based on what you've said in this message, I'm thinking Columbia sounds like it's a better fit for you. <br>  <br>  Can you get to NYC for a visit? Now that you've been accepted, it'd be really beneficial for you to visit both schools, tour the SW department, speak to people there, etc., before you decide.

I was so fed up with the laziness of the class that I could not take it after just one.  The students complained to the dean that I gave essay question on tests instead of true/false and multiple choice that they were used to. They also complained because I gave 0 on homework assignments when they copied someone else's homework including 0 to the one who let them. At the end of the final exam, one student who had never turned in any homework and flunked all the tests came to me and asked for a passing grade.  Ha ha ha. A big fat F for him.  I gave 3 As, 8 Bs, 16 Cs, 10 Ds, and 1 F.  One of the A students went on to become the Director of Information Services at that very college.

Once you learn to ride a bike, you never forget, even if you haven't ridden in years. That's somatic memory.<br>  <br>  If you drive a car with a console shift, and then switch to a truck with a steering column shift, you'll be reaching for that console shift for weeks until your body remembers the change to steering column. I had one of each, and my hand never knew what to reach for.<br>  <br>  Often the term "somatic memory" is used by trauma therapists to talk about somatic symptoms of headache, stomach pain, and other symptoms that don't seem to have a physical cause -- but that can be related to trauma suffered, perhaps in childhood, and then forgotten by the mind -- but not by the body.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	'somatic' simply means 'to do with the body'.<br>  <br>  A somatic memory would be a memory apparently held in the body itself, although in reality it would probably be a memory expressed in some bodily way.<br>  <br>  An example would be the kind of 'muscle memory' which is created by many repetitions of an action, like an athlete or gymnast practicing a form, so that the body naturally goes into the form with no conscious thought.<br>  <br>  Another example might be physical pain suffered as part of a flashback experience, following trauma.

These body memories are supposed to be your body's way of remembering something, like a tragic event, you're not conscious of. <br>  <br>  "Many individuals develop trauma related reactions, even when they have no memory of the incident. For example, many people who have experienced serious car accidents and who do not remember the accident have strong negative reactions to being in a car or driving by the scene of the accident (even when they do not remember where the accident took place.) Many war veterans who have little memory of the war will suddenly duck when they hear a loud sound without understanding why.<br>  <br>  'Somatic dissociation' (a term used by Scaer, 2001), is often a problem experienced in parts of the body (that is, other than the brain). Symptoms will often present themselves as physical problems that often cannot be explained by the usual means (lab tests, x-ray studies, routine examinations).

NCZK0QyGaa	Sorry you had to go through that.  It sounds like a tough situation to get over.  It's important to know that you're not the only one and that most people are struggling through the same fears.  I would suggest focusing on one individual in class who you know and are comfortable with and try to pretend that you are only speaking to them.  Also, be extremely prepared but if you do make a mistake, know that most people in the class either understand or don't notice.  Take a look around the classroom while other people are giving their speeches and notice how many people are focused on other things: the clock, notes, their phone.|`|s0h6sIRhaa	Speech com is unfortunately a necessary evil in college.  I also have major social anxiety, and the only way I got through it was making it be the first class I took ever, so I was with a whole bunch of other college newbies and we were all nervous together.  I also volunteered to go first.  Trust me, the class is SO much easier when you got your speech over and done with, and you can listen to everyone else up there nervous and wishing it was over (even if they look calm, they are ALL nervous!)  You might not have either of those options (so it sounds like).  Is there a professor ratings system at your school?  If so, read what other students have to say about the various SCOM professors, and pick the easiest one.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, none of this is going to make you feel better when actually giving a speech.  I would recommend avoiding caffeine, for sure, and just making sure you're prepared.  It's 10 times worse if you're not prepared for the speech, because you know it and your whole class knows it, therefore spiking your anxiety to unprecedented levels.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|y7fvIDhqaa	I know exactly how you feel. I took that class my freshman year and it wasn't too bad for me coz my class was smaller. Just imagine if English is not your first language and that was my problem lol. I stutter a lot, I just wanted to collapse and die but everyone in the class had a lot of patience. Just remember, You're not the only one who's so damn nervous to speak in front of a lot of people. What I did was, when I was given the topic, I'd write it on a piece of paper and I practiced it like I was giving my speech. Do it over and over without reading what you just wrote. That's exactly how I got through the public speaking class. I would never take it either but I had to in order to graduate. I hope this helps, just relax and pretend that nobody is staring at you. Practice your speech over and over! Good luck :)

I turned 18 two weeks prior to graduation. It also very common to graduate at 19 due to schools having earlier birthday requirements which forces parents like myself to wait an extra year before putting our kids in...(ie That is why child support is payable to age 19 now if your child is still in hs...it ends at graduation or age 19...whichever comes first.)|`|ivkGknUsaa	In the US, 17 or 18 and sometimes 19. <br>  <br>  In some other countries, some Asian countries for example, people graduate from high school at 15 or 16.

VkWVV1SDaa	In 1736, Euler solved a problem known as the Seven Bridges of K?nigsberg. The city of K?nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point. It is not; and therefore not an Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and planar graph theory.  Euler also introduced the notion now known as the Euler characteristic of a space and a formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron with this constant. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy and L'Huillier, is at the origin of topology|`|BLTo4xL9aa	if you want to know your answer try to search on the internet like yahoo. and., be understand the details of the information so try it and check it out...!!!

AA10407542	I would read the story, think of how you feel about it, and promote the lessons in it with something that gives the children a chance to act these out after you read it. I would use aspects of dramatic play because children can negotiate with each other acting as fish with the morals of the story fresh.  You would be doing observations of different children receiving different lessons.  Its interesting that this story is the choice because there is a bit of controversy of what the true theme is.  Is it fair play and community, or is it aspects of socialism.  Some might neglect looking into this but I am sure your dramatic play will display a little divergence of the moral of the story.  I think the story does contain an amazing message that offers the tone of helping others who have less and this is needed.  Your teaching could support the theme as it is read but with dramatic play it can support individual interpretation as honest representations.|`|0YRFCzYaaa	get the toys out and say ok everybody play with one toy by themselves,and dont let anyone else play with it. do this for about three minutes.<br>  then asked them how it made them feel and then say ok this time take a toy and let other people play with it with you. then ask them how it made them feel and then explain that sharing is good and read the bit in the book. maybe you could get them to draw sharing or write a little on how to share, doesn't have to be proper sentences, maybe just keywords like, kind, nice, happy or you could all do it together on the whiteboard|`|dBpmyIduaa	I just did this lesson with my preschool class and they absolutely understood that the rainbow fish was not nice to the blue fish.

Instead, you go directly to each university's website, and use the application they provide. <br>  <br>  Some unis in the US do accept something called "the common application", which can help, as you fill out just that one form and then have it sent to several unis. But if a uni accepts that, they'll tell you so, and tell you how to access it. <br>  <br>  The advantage to the US's system not being centralized is that you can apply to as many unis as you'd like.

cL0aHkYEaa	"Little Bear is cold" is absolutely 100% right as the translation of "Osito tiene frio."  In Spanish, when you want to make something diminutive, you add -ito or -ita to the end.  So--muchacha is girl; muchachita is little girl.  Perro is dog; perrito is little dog.  Oso is bear; osito is little bear.<br>  <br>  In Spanish, to express being cold, the verb "to have (tener)" is used, not the verb "to be."<br>  <br>  So--<br>  tengo frio--I am cold<br>  tienes frio--you are cold<br>  tiene frio--he, she, or it is cold.<br>  <br>  "Osito tiene frio" = Little Bear is cold.<br>  <br>  Added information:<br>  <br>  No--this is the way you say it.  In Spanish, to say that one is cold (meaning feeling chilly) you have to use the verb tener.  If you translated it verbatim, you would get "I have cold" and could easily be confused, thinking that the person is saying that they have a cold.  But if  he or she wanted to say that they had a cold (meaning sick with the sniffles), then it would be, "Estoy gripado." (Which, if translated literally to English would be, "I'm colded."<br>  <br>  But no....don't forget that you cannot translate word for word from English to Spanish--or from English to any other language for that matter.  And vice versa.  Each language has its own unique grammar, word order, and set of idiomatic expressions.  <br>  <br>  I know you cannot understand why someone would use the verb "have" to express feeling chilly, but that is because you are thinking in English.  You can't do that.  You have to think in Spanish.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, look at this website: <a href="http://vegasociety.com/spanish/ser_estar.html" rel="nofollow">http://vegasociety.com/spanish/ser_estar...</a><br>  scroll down to "Verb Tener"|`|iuWfp2fEaa	According to Babelfish, Little bear is cold translates to "Osa Menor es frío" in Spanish.

jjRYu4P5aa	Look, this is a bit complicated to explain, but anyway the answer is 42,857. Check how you get it:<br>  Use table multiplication.<br>  <br>  1xxxxx<br>  _____3<br>  xxxxx1<br>  <br>  since 1xxxxx is 3 times smaller than xxxxx1, it means that 3 * 1xxxxx = xxxxx1<br>  <br>  So, step 1, you can see from the multiplication table that x * 3 must be equal to 1, so 3x=1. Notice: x cannot be 1/3, so x must be such a number, so that the end unit of the product will be 1. In this case 7. 7*3=21. Now we do get the 1, keeping the 2 in mind for the second multiplication. <br>  <br>  We can deduce the following by replacing our 1st value: 7<br>  1xxxx7<br>  _____3<br>  xxxx71<br>  <br>  Step 2:This implies that 3x+2(with the 2 coming from the 1st multiplication) must be equal to 7. So 3x+2=7, hence 3x=5, here again x cannot be 5/3, so x is such a number, that the end unit of product 3x must be 5.<br>  x=5 so 3x=15 (keeping the 1 in mind). So we get.<br>  <br>  1xxx57<br>  _____3<br>  xxx571<br>  <br>  Step 3: here we get that 3x+1(1 comes from the second multiplication) must be equal to 5, so 3x+1=5, 3x=4.<br>  Use same principle, you will get that x=8, since 3*8=24(end unit is 4, and we keep the 2 in mind for the next multiplication)<br>  <br>  1xx857<br>  _____3<br>  xx8571<br>  <br>  Step 4, 3x+2(2 comes from the 3rd multp) = 8<br>  3x+2=8, x=2<br>  <br>  1x2857<br>  _____3<br>  x28571<br>  <br>  And finally, 3x=2, so x must be 4 , since 3*4=12 (with the 1 kept in mind, and being the number placed initially in front)<br>  <br>  142857<br>  _____3<br>  428571<br>  <br>  42857 is the 5 didgit number,<br>  <br>  hope this answers ur question!|`|ACpZ02opaa	00000|`|SRgsXh2Qaa	30001

DUSM3LUpaa	One major downside to an "equality of opportunity" paradigm is that actual equality of opportunity is not fully interrogated.<br>  <br>  That's to say, if a Black student went to a substandard public school with no lab equipment, and suffered health problems due to environmental degradation in his community, just ensuring that the college he applies to does not refuse admission to all Black students is not sufficient to ensure that he has "equal opportunity" to attend as a White student who went to a well-funded school and grew up healthy. Clearly, even though the college admissions office does not de jure privilege one over the other, refusing to consider elements beyond race (but related to race) that affect opportunity potential puts the Black kid at a disadvantage.<br>  <br>  Ensuring equality of results is a much less practical and clear paradigm for improving access to a whole host of opportunities, but some element of it needs to be included to account for the fact that "equality of opportunity" only really applies if everyone begins on relatively equal grounding, that a history of oppression has not influenced one's ability to get to the door in the first place, much less have it opened. <br>  <br>  But I don't think "equality of results" needs to effect the outcome the other poster feared. To continue with an education example, it is not that, if both the Black and White students above were admitted, they must automatically receive the same grade at the end of the first term. Instead, it should be recognized that the Black student may require resources to achieve his potential that the White student will not require. There is the assumption that because the Black student does not know how to use a Bunsen burner, for example, that he is not intelligent enough to continue in the sciences Rather, his inability to do so stems from the same place as my inability to fly a plane: we don't have access to that information at this time. Raising our eyes to the inequalities of access helps to achieve this "equality of results."<br>  <br>  Basically, my point is that we should not pat ourselves on the back for admitting at-population proportions of people of color to colleges and universities if they are not given the resources and support they need to succeed when they get here. Aiming for "equality of results" forces us to examine more fully the barriers to access that are sidestepped when we speak only of "equality of opportunity."<br>  <br>  God, that was rambly. Hope it's helpful, and good luck with your paper.|`|AA11135726	It is not. Equality of Opportunity gives everyone the same opportunity to do something. It would be like giving everyone $100 to start a business and they can use nothing else. Everyone has the same opportunity to start but some people may do different things with the money.<br>  Equality of results makes sure that everyone turns out the same in the end. So if someone spends the entire year working their butt off to make money and someone else does nothing, at the end of the year they will still be paid the same. or if two people have very different work ethics both will still be paid the same amount at the end. this is basically communism (yeah i know people dont like hearing that) they tried it and they found that it didnt work. but now people are tryingto make it look different though it is the same exact thing!

AA10023710	Usually, at most universities I've had experience recruiting at, how interview sign-ups happen is determined by me - by the employer, not the university. The university often does offer the employer different options: just have students sign up, or would you like us to screen them for you first, or would you like to go through our resume books, etc. The employer picks how they want the interviews to be set up. <br>  <br>  I've never been to a school that just let students sign up.

I used to work in a college admission office at a 4 year private school, and for students that had more than 30 semester hours completed at the college level we wouldn't require they submit high school transcripts.

vhlORK4Waa	I'll go for elaborate scenery, particularly as an oratorio is a large musical composition including an orchestra, a choir, and soloists.|`|K2jjYfTWaa	elaborate scenery<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Structure<br>  Oratorios usually contain:<br>  <br>  An overture, for instruments alone <br>  Various arias, sung by the vocal soloists <br>  Recitative, usually employed to advance the plot <br>  Choruses, often monumental and meant to convey a sense of glory. Frequently the instruments for oratorio choruses include timpani and trumpets. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio</a>|`|2n3MTJgraa	An oratorio is a large musical composition including an orchestra, a choir, and soloists. The oratorio was somewhat modeled after the opera. Their similarities include the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece, though they are sometimes staged as operas. There is little or no interaction between the characters, no props or elaborate costumes. The most important difference is their subject matter. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder. There are many exceptions, including Saint Saens' opera, Samson et Dalila, Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron and others. Additionally, there are operas that deal with religious movements such as Meyerbeers Les Huguenots. The plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th century Italy partly because of the success of the opera and the Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera buffs.<br>  <br>  During the second half of the 17th century, there were trends toward the secularization of the religious oratorio. Evidence of this lies in its regular performance outside church halls in courts and public theaters. Whether religious or secular, the theme of an oratorio is meant to be weighty. It could include such topics as a creation myth, the life of Jesus, or the career of a classical hero or biblical prophet. Other changes eventually took place as well, possibly because most composers of oratorios were also popular composers of operas. They began to publish the librettos of their oratorios as they did for their operas. Strong emphasis was soon placed on arias while the use of the choir diminished. Female singers became regularly employed, and replaced the male narrator with the use of recitatives. Eventually, Monteverdi composed Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda which is considered to be the first secular oratorio.<br>  <br>  George Frideric Handel, most famous today for his Messiah, also wrote secular oratorios based on themes from Greek and Roman mythology. He is also credited with writing the first English language oratorio.

tTg1XU8faa	No; you can only cancel out things in a rational expression if they are multiplied together. If they are being added or subtracted, you can NOT cancel it out. (r + 6)/(r^2 - r - 6), which is (r + 6)/(r - 3)(r + 2) when factored, is already simplified; there is nothing further that you can cancel out. If it was something like (x + 2)/(x + 2)(x + 3), then you could cancel out the (x + 2) in the numerator and denominator since it is a factor of each of them, which would end you up with 1/(x + 3). However, this not the case in this rational expression, so you cannot cancel anything out.|`|zLcYfde4aa	Yes, anything minus itself = 0 and is cancelled out.

c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	This is a really hard question because there are a few things to really think about. <br>  <br>  They are all really high paying, if you are really good at them, and low paying if you are not. You might want to ask your self questions about what kind of future life you want to have.<br>  <br>  Fashion: Very hard to brake into, higher chance of getting a degree you can not do anything with. In order to make a great deal of money in this industry you will have to relocate. Also doesn't hold up well in recession. <br>  <br>  Psychology: How long do you want to go to school in this field? If you go all the way through medical school you will have doctors wages. If you get your B.A. you can get just about any job with any other B.A. Maybe work in an HR department for 40k a year. <br>  <br>  Interior design: Again this is not  recession proof field, and you could make anywhere from 20K to 200K a year, but this depends on if you have real talent or not, how hard you work and how much you are able to build up your business. <br>  <br>  Law: Again how long do you want to go to school for this? A BA in law and you can work in a law office, make about 35-40K a year. In some states after working in a law office you can challenge the bar. In other cases that means law school. Lawyers make very different wages depending on what kind of law they practice. You could always get  job in government though at around 75k. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I think you need to think about how much time you want to go to school and what kind of life you want to live as an adult. You'll get a better idea of where to go after that. <br>  <br>  Also you could try taking a few college classes on all of these subjects and see what you do best in. Maybe not fashion though, it's a real long shot and honestly most people with fashion degrees end up not really doing what they want to with their degrees.|`|ZqfupVuxaa	psychology !!!!!!<br>  in term of money is definitely the best ( law as well but it is more complicated to get and you need luck and it wasn't working so good 10 years back )<br>  <br>  psychology had a reputation in the past and also in the future it will probably be the best !!!<br>  <br>  but you need to do one you feel passionate about !!!!|`|Swmd0P2uaa	Psycholody or law would  be the fields that have held more stable incomes. Interior design and fashion are great careers, expecially for some artistic who likes making some of their own terms, but they're also more risky than the ladder. Look at this chart, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123119236117055127.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12311923...</a> Psychologist is not on there, but job #8 & 12 are similar. Law is not on there but # 17 is related. (lawyers asst.) Painter is listed under worst jobs, probablly because its not a bad thing to be- but its hard to make a living at it. <br>  Here are some of the fastest growing jobs right now and what is expected to happen to them in the future. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocotjt1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocotjt1.htm</a><br>  I recomend if you are looking at school for a career, you could try volunteering at some of the jobs you are interested in- you can find opportuntiies online or through colleges. It made a big difference for me. (you can learn a lot about yourself!) There are volunteer opporunities with kids where you can be a mentor (psychology exp.) or helping out with designing clothes for a local play. (search for dinner theaters to find somewhere)<br>  Good luck|`|KpeqFKAOaa	Well i would advise you to take a step back and get your head out of the clouds. If you get into a field because of the money there will be no money. If you get into a field that you really love and are passionate about, then you will have success and possibly money. If kids get into careers because of the money and not because of passion, then the future economy will be screwed. The history of a profession means nothing and the future of a profession is impossible to foresee. Which ever one of those fields that you have already started to research in, then that is the field you should go in.

I wasn't sure what about St. John's you like, so I went with both colleges that are in/near NYC that I think may fit, and also those in NY state which you might like. So if it was the city you wanted to be near, Ithaca, Siena, Syracuse, Utica, Buffalo, Albany, Plattsburgh and Cortlandt can be eliminated as options, as they are no where near NYC. Marist might also be too far, if you want right in the city, but it's accessible by train, no big deal. Iona is just outside the city, and the commute into Grand Central is only a 1/2 hour - that's shorter than taking the train from parts of the Bronx to Grand Central, so I listed it.

lQIKWXDuaa	Hey there,  as you know there is a shortage for nurses in the US. If you did a job search right at your local hospital you will see that they need nurses. That said you wont have have a hard time finding a nursing job, if you get the needed experience in undergrad. Make sure the school that you attend has lots of clinical. As a nursing student, you can look for nursing student job at your hospital. They have those. This will give you an opportunity to get the experience that you need to get a registered nurse job once you graduate. I think in four more years, they will still need new nurses.<br>  <br>  ss<br>  <br>  ss|`|2gyJUTzRaa	Nowadays, EVERYONE has trouble finding a job right after they graduate.  So don't just start over.  I'd day, if after a year you don't find a job in nursing, then maybe get a Masters.

4Pk6VNftaa	So let me get this straight.  They pull kids out of class to do the drug testing? (for your daughter, it was from 2pm to 3:30pm)<br>  <br>  What would have happened if they pulled her out at, say, 9am, but she couldn't give a sample until 12pm?  She would have missed half a day of classes?  What if she had a test or something in those classes?   What if the kid has a shy bladder and can't just pee on demand?<br>  <br>  Seems to me the school's testing procedure is rather broken.  But then again, with schools taking this stupid zero-tolerance stance, common sense and decency seems to have been flung out the window.<br>  <br>  Have you spoken to the principal about the incident?  Otherwise, go to the superintendent.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you could always do the typical American thing and file a lawsuit, make a bunch of noise to the local media, do a few interviews, make the school look stupid (which they probably deserve) and then settle out of court for a few hundred thousand dollars - most of which will go to your lawyer, and probably result in the sports program having its funding cut because someone filed a lawsuit against the school system...  All around, a lose-lose situation for everyone.<br>  <br>  It's really sad that we seem to have put our priorities on "protecting the children" above "the children" themselves.  And it's even sadder that the only way to get something rectified is to threaten someone with a lawsuit because "they were only following orders."|`|cZIjf5AHaa	you should definitely fight that. go to the school board and tell them, or talk to the principal. see if the same thing has happened to any of her friends. this is ridiculous. she should NOT be suspended from sports because she couldn't pee. circumstances were out of her control. she was probably stressed too, so that didn't help. and you can definitely take legal action in this case, because her rights WERE violated.|`|BF2szcY4aa	=O!<br>  thats friggin horrible!!!!!!!<br>  i would get my butt into that school office and show them the passed test results, and have all those handy 'eyewitnesses' there to prove the point.<br>  <br>  <br>  thats simply discrimination

AA10023710	You should apply to at least 1-2 reach schools, like MIT. Your grades and SATs are just fine for them - but they are reach schools. Still, why not *try*? I actually think you stand at least a shot at MIT. <br>  <br>  You said math/science, so I assume we are *not* talking about engineering. If you do want engineering, this list is wrong. But for math/science, I'd have you look at: Princeton, Harvard, MIT, Yale, Columbia, NYU, Cornell, Brown, U Penn, Johns Hopkins, SUNY Stony Brook, Rutgers New Brunswick, Penn State University Park, Carnegie Mellon, Brandeis, U Maryland College Park, Boston U, U Rochester, Dartmouth, Rensselaer Polytechnic, SUNY Buffalo, UMass Amherst, Tufts, UConn, SUNY Albany. <br>  <br>  Naturally, some of those are very hard to get into, some less so. All are great math/science schools, and overall very strong universities. <br>  <br>  And I still don't see why you think you might not get into schools at the level of MIT. I think you might. I think you're selling yourself short.|`|qTcbPuahaa	your credentials aren't bad at all, seriously,<br>  I had worse sat II scores and i still "tried" applying to all really good schools<br>  <br>  I haven't heard from all of the schools yet, but I got into the University of Chicago :D<br>  <br>  oh and a lot of "ivy leagues" are not that hard to get into, like Darthmouth and Brown or Cornell, I'm sure you could get into one of those if you applied.  <br>  <br>  The competition is very tough, but we are all in the same boat, and you never know, you might get into your dream school<br>  <br>  So I say to apply to at least 3 reach schools, If you try more, I'm pretty sure you'll get into at least one.

Start with Pre-Med at a community College or Biology.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is your route:<br>  "You need to go to undergraduate school and graduate, take the MSAT exam, apply and be accepted to medical school.<br>  <br>  The standard U.S. medical school curriculum is four years long. The first two years are composed mainly of classroom education, while the last two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Upon successful completion of medical school, students are granted the title of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). Upon graduation, physicians who plan to independently care for patients must complete a residency which is a supervised training period of three to seven years. Physicians who sub-specialize or who desire more supervised experience may complete a fellowship, which is an additional one to three years of supervised training in their area of expertise. Licensing of medical doctors in the United States is co-ordinated at the state level. Most states require that prospective licensees complete the following requirements:<br>  <br>  - Graduation from an accredited medical school granting the degree of DO or MD<br>  <br>  - United States and Canada schools must be accredited by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine or the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.<br>  <br>  - Foreign medical school graduates generally must complete some training within the United States.<br>  <br>  - Satisfactory completion of at least one year of an AOA- or ACGME-approved residency.<br>  <br>  - Passage of the United States Medical Licensing Examination or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE, COMLEX, or simply "the boards"). USMLE and COMLEX both consist of four similar parts:<br>  -- Step I is taken at the end of the second year of medical school and tests students' mastery of the basic sciences as they apply to medicine.<br>  <br>  --Step II CK is taken during the fourth year of medical school and tests students' mastery of the management of ill patients.<br>  <br>  --Step II CS is taken during the fourth year of medical school and tests students' mastery of clinical skills using a series of standardized patient encounters.<br>  <br>  --Step III is taken after the first year of a residency program and tests physicians' ability to independently manage the care of patients." - Answer by Blandest6794|`|4c056b35b4e33a793a012798113bbc31aa	its never to late.<br>  but something that would be quicker would be to get your B.S. in nursing. that would only take 4 years. a nurse is a very well paying respectably job|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I strongly encourage you to follow your dream.

AA11604732	Any major is fine.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, an MBA is not worth it unless you go to a ranked program.  The higher the ranking, the better.  Going to a top 15 program will get you a job in the $120K range.  Going to a ranked program outside the top 15 will get you a good job, with salaries increasing for the higher ranked programs.  Getting an MBA from an unranked program will do little more for you than a BS in Business.  Getting an MBA from an Online college will actually hurt your earning potential.<br>  <br>  I don't think that choosing an MBA program based on geography is a good idea -- and would not personally choose ANY MBA program in Texas.<br>  <br>  That being said -- the University of Texas is the best MBA program by a wide mile.  In some surveys, it is a top 20 MBA program -- but probably belongs somewhere between 20-30.  There are three other programs that are ranked lower than Texas, but in the top 50.  In order, they are Texas A&M, Rice and then SMU.<br>  <br>  In order to get into any ranked MBA program, you will need an undergraduate degree and three to five years of work experience.<br>  <br>  But really -- if you can get into a better program, go somewhere other than Texas.

They don't realize that taking away a school's funding because they're not meeting AYP won't make the school make AYP.

NCLB is a total waste of time, and has proven unproductive. <br>  <br>  Schools can only do so much. We can toss all kinds of money at them, but when kids come in to class with no breakfast, have no support at home, and have role models that are the antithesis of what we have held to be 'fine upstanding family values', they are ill-prepared.<br>  <br>  They toss all kinds of money at high schools, when the thoughts of the adolescents are anywhere BUT on schoolwork (hormones are a terrible thing to waste), then bemoan the 'lack of progress'. <br>  <br>  The above show that the 'leaders' are clueless.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to be part of the change, then embrace whatever works, do what you have to do to survive, and remember that the two most important reasons to become a teacher are July and August.

Please give details with no stupid answers either!|`|tpfj8XJoaa	you should probably put this in singles & dating. you'll get more responses.|`|0IpeXqK3aa	well i have only fallen in love once but i have been with many girls . i moved out of my home town to a smaller city . i knew no one but an uncle . i quickly got a job there and began to make friends but i had already gone through so many disappointing friends so tried not to trust anyone so much.anyways, i first laid eyes on her on my interview day for the job. i just saw her and a very natural huge smile came out without me realizing it i didn't have chance to say anything cuz i was called in to the office. i got hired . every chance she saw me and i saw her we waved to each other. some time passes and we really dont talk much other then hello and good bye, but we smile at each other a lot. now sense i was new everyone seem to have put me on the spot meaning i was always being watched and i drove a truck with a stuffed heart hanging from the rear view mirror and everyone wanted to know the story behind it . the first question they asked was if i was single i said yes and then if it was from a loved one to me that includes old GF's i said no . i then decided to ask her out and she to was curious about it .i told her and only her about it . she cried.on our first date.i told her cuz i felt something. evetually i ask her parents if i can date her and they said yes then we started to date more often and she conffessed that from day one when i smiled at her she fell in love with me and i too with her.my life right before her was all F****** up i was already having suicidal tendencies. and was dying from the inside from all the people that were doing me wrong but she helped me and when it got difficult she didnt quit im now engaged to her and we are going to get married in july.i just felt something unexplainable for her. it was confort it was happiness, it was joy, it was wanted , but not just simply wanted cuz there was more then that .i thought she was a dork in a good way especially me coming form a group of violent *** people. before we went out i told her everything about me , where i come from ,what i have done, who i've done, and then asked her if she was sure she wanted to go out with me. i would have thought she would have been overwhelmed and scared but she said yes. she was more intrigued to learning more about me. i dont know if this helps if you want more details let me know i'll be more then happy to let you know.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	i fell over the cat once
mm7ABdlXaa	Whether you will be eligible for additional financial aid when you go back will depend on your FAFSA, as always, and on how much and what types of financial aid you've already received.<br>  It will also depend on whether or not your current loans go into default.  They become due and payable 6 months (generally) after you drop below half time status.  If you just take a semester off and then go back - no worries.<br>  Now, as far as this semester's money.  That depends on how close you are to finishing the semester.  Have you passed the 'due date' to drop?  My best advice is to make an appointment with a financial aid adviser at your school, who can look at your specific aid package, and your specific circumstances.<br>  Good luck!|`|AA11635897	I doubt you'll get a refund for this semester, but as long as you withdraw the right way(actually withdrawing from classes and filling out paper work for a leave of absence) instead of just stopping attending classes, you should be ok in the future with financial aid.

From my perspective as a professor though, I prefer that you have the book before the second class, as I assign readings.

You are eligible to take the lower level ROTC courses for credit (which are basically physical training classes; no service commitment required) by registering through the community college itself.  You would have to commute to the university campus on your own accord.

So you must divide the "percent" over 100 in order to work with it as a decimal in your equations. As an example, 45% means 45 per 100 or 45/100. When you divide 45/100 you get 0.45. There was another answer on here that multiplied 64% as 1.64 i believe... that is not correct. 1.64 technically is 164% (164/100 is 1.64)    ok, now to solve....    17.98 times 0.64= 11.5072  so in order to increase 17.98 by 64%, you must add 11.5072 to 17.98 and you get 29.4872     9.50 times 0.20 = 1.9  so in order to decrease 9.50 by 20%, you must subtract 1.9 from 9.5 and you get 7.6    now to increase that answer by 5%.......  7.6 times 0.05 = 0.38  so in order to increase that result by 5%, you must add 0.38 to 7.6, and you get 7.98    hope this helps!!!|`|i1sG53IHaa	$17.98x1.64%=29.4972  $9.50x0.80=$7.60x1.05%=$7.98
6DFhlt4daa	Dike:    The main purpose of an artificial dike is to prevent flooding of the adjoining countryside; however, they also confine the flow of the river resulting in higher and faster water flow. Dikes can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high-floods, along lakes or along polders. Furthermore, dikes have been built for the purpose of empoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by dikes. Dikes have also been built as field boundaries and as military defences. More on this type of dike can be found in the article on dry-stone walls.    Dikes can be permanent earthworks or emergency constructions (often of sandbags), built hastily in a flood emergency. When such an emergency bank is added on top of an existing dike, it is known as a cradge.    http://www.answers.com/dike    Dam:    A barrier or structure across a stream, river, or waterway for the purpose of confining and controlling the flow of water. Dams vary in size from small earth embankments for farm use to high, massive concrete structures for water supply, hydropower, irrigation, navigation, recreation, sedimentation control, and flood control. As such, dams are cornerstones in the water resources development of river basins. Dams are now built to serve several purposes and are therefore known as multipurpose. The construction of a large dam requires the relocation of existing highways, railroads, and utilities from the river valley to elevations above the reservoir. The two principal types of dams are embankment and concrete. Appurtenant structures of dams include spillways, outlet works, and control facilities; they may also include structures related to hydropower and other project purposes.     barrier, commonly across a watercourse, to hold back water, often forming a reservoir or lake; dams are also sometimes used to control or contain rockslides, mudflows, and the like in regions where these are common. Dams are made of timber, rock, earth, masonry, or concrete or of combinations of these materials. Timber is seldom used in dams because timbers are impermanent and their height is limited. Rock-fill dams consist of an embankment of loose rock with either a core impervious to water (e.g., clay) or a watertight face on the upstream side. Earth dams may be either simple embankments of earth or embankments reinforced with a core of cement or with an upstream surface made watertight. Masonry and concrete dams are either gravity dams or arch dams (either single-arch or multiple-arch). Gravity dams are dependent upon their own weight for resistance to the pressure of the water. Single-arch dams are curved upstream and are usually constructed in narrow canyons or gorges where the rocky side walls are strong enough to withstand the tremendous lateral thrust of the dam that is caused by the pressure of the water. Dams of the multiple-arch type consist of a number of single arches supported by buttresses. Dams may also be constructed with roller-compacted concrete, in which thin layers of concrete are compacted as if they were earth layers; this produces a far stronger dam, without the need for full forms.    A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates, levees, and "dikes" are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.    http://www.answers.com/dam

AA11603244	a, A solo concerto is a concerto with only one soloist, accompanied by an orchestra. It is now the most frequent type of concerto, but originated in the Baroque Period (approx. 1600-1750) as an alternative to the traditional concertino (solo group of instruments) in a concerto grosso, to increase the contrast between the soloist and the orchestra.<br>  <br>  The concerto had three movements, which were traditionally fast (vigorous and showed contrast between groups of instruments), slow (lyrical and intimate in a new key) then fast (lively and dancelike). The first and third movements were most commonly in ritornello form|`|Cql8D5Miaa	a- instrumental work, usually in three movements, that features one performer supported by an accompanying group of instruments <br>  <br>  is the correct answer :)

Bunny Ears<br>  Probably the most common method for teaching kids to tie their own shoes is the "Bunny Ears" method.<br>  <br>     Tell the child that he needs to make his shoe laces into "bunny ears."<br>     First, he needs to secure a knot for the bunny's head. Take the laces and cross them over to make an "X". Then, pull one ear through the bottom of the "X" and pull tight.<br>     Say, "Now we need to give bunny some ears." Loop the laces into "bunny ears".<br>     Tell the child that now we need to "make the bunny ears tight so they don't fall off". Then make another "X" using the "bunny ears", slide one "ear" under the "X" and pull tightly.<br>  <br>  2. Bi-Colored Laces<br>  This is a great tip that can really make learning to tie much easier. Take two laces in two different colors and cut them down the middle. Then sew them together to make two bi-colored laces. Lace a pair of old shoes with these funny shoes strings. Using bi-colored laces can really help a kid who has trouble remembering his right from his left. You can use any learning-to-tie method in combination with your bi-colored laces.<br>  <br>  3. Cardboard Cut-Out Shoe<br>  Take a cardboard box and cut out an over-sized shoe shape. Have your kid decorate the shoe in any way he wishes. Using a pen, poke holes for laces. Use the bi-colored lace tip above, but instead of cutting the original laces in two, use two entire laces sewn together to create one long, bi-colored shoe string. Lace the shoe and use any teaching method, using this cut-out. Some kids find it easier and more interesting to practice on an over-sized model.<br>  <br>  4. The Squirrel and the Tree<br>  This is a fun method that utilizes a kid friendly story and movements that help kids understand and remember the basic steps to shoe tying.<br>  <br>       Tell the child to create "tree roots" by making a starter knot.<br>       Make a tree with a long thin loop; hold the loop in the child's right hand.<br>       With his left hand, take hold of the lace and tell him that a squirrel runs around the tree and jumps into the hole under the tree and comes out the other side (he'll need to switch hands at this point which can be difficult for some kids).<br>  <br>  Many parents prefer this trick because it teaches the kid to tie shoes with the single loop method.<br>  <br>  5. Loop It and Swoop It<br>  This is a less childish, but still memorable way of teaching a child to tie in the traditional single loop method. Teach your child to tie his shoes using the standard tying method, but as you go through the motions say, "loop it, swoop it, pull." Do this over and over while repeating the same three, simple instructions until your child is able to tie his shoes on his own. Encourage him to say "loop it, swoop it, pull" each time he attempts tying his shoes until it becomes second nature.<br>  <br>  6. Learning to Tie Toys and Books<br>  If you want to make learning to tie more fun, consider getting your child a toy or book that will help him learn to tie on his own. This is especially helpful for kids who learn best through interaction with toys.|`|OMrSVM98aa	Okay, they cant just learn by they just staring and not knowing, you need to show the whole thing in their eyes. Then first go step by step<br>  Show them how to make the first step making a loop around the laces. Then show them how to make the hole easy.Get the string and show them very "SLOWLY" and get them to follow as you go "SLOWLY". And probably u'll know what the next step is.|`|f6v64lmMaa	Hi Silk Over Glass<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to sit show them on a shoe with them behind you, this way they can see the way you do it. Show them a few times and let them practice. Another idea is to make some holes in a piece of cardboard and thread some shoe laces through the wholes this way it gives them a way to practice. It takes time. Good luck|`|duU7UhATaa	simple, just take your shoes and ask them to look at while hande their own shoes..<br>  Do like a presentation and with fun story, each step you do, ask them to follow.<br>  No angry, no bad words, just laugh if they get it not rite.<br>  the best point: patient|`|P2v5ZtAbaa	i use a little story to go with it the 1 bow is a tree and the other string is a squirrel the squirrel runs around the tree and  through a hole  then ytou pull it tight<br>  that is how i learned|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Keep showing them and let them keep doing it over and over until they get it right.

Going to a university and getting a degree will make you less susceptible to swings in the economy.

AA11942204	Glad you have a sense of humor -- you'll need it. In my program I took the MA by course work along, no comps no thesis. At the Ph.D. level after doing course work I had comps and they were brutal. Three 8 hour written exams (MWF) and then a 3-hour oral. Recently I was on the other end of this and it was much more humane. We had given the candidate a list of readings and at the oral he made a presentation about them and we asked him some questions. Most people do pass the orals. It is not just a rite of passage the way the dissertation defence is but they are not going to stop you unless they really feel you should be stopped. And if that is how they feel then it doesn't matter how well prepared you think you are. So just learn what you can, go to the bathroom before the orals, do the best you can and get on with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Sam has THE best criminal justice program, a great music major program and also a good communications/english and radio/tv/journalism program. PV has a decent business school also, a great nursing program and a way better engineering program than either SFA or Sam has. dont know squat about commerce actually. Also look into the geography of the area, you might find one place to be too far from civilization for your likes. all in all, if you stick with SFA, SAM or PV, you will have a respectable degree and job.
qLkMSEBwaa	I replied to you with this info on your other question about this but reposting....<br>  <br>  Even though I spank my son if and when he needed it, and I believe taking out spanking in schools and teaching about God really is what caused kids to take over the schools, You CAN NOT take it upon yourself to spank these kids!!!!!!!!!! You will have heck to pay with the parents who think their kids are always angels and end up without a job!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I did daycare for years..Private, professional, and had my own business, also volunteered in the schools when my son was small….I did 15-17 hour days between all my jobs.<br>  <br>  I know how to take care of these kind of kids. I transformed who was honestly, what you would think the spawn of the devil is going to be in a kid. Teachers had no control of this kid. He called them all B*!ches and I got 1 teacher fired over what she did to him against another child.<br>  <br>  The boy was hell on wheels, but I got down to his level on a 1 on 1. He was put in time out, refused and I sat him down and restrained him onto my lap until his timeout was over. He kicked and hit me, cussed me out, and ended up cutting my lip. <br>  <br>  I sat him down afterward..I said, Michael, You really hurt my feelings. I said, you busted my lip, you called me bad names, you call everyone else bad names and you don't listen to ANY of the teachers. I said, I am more than your teacher, I can be your friend, but you have to be my friend too and listen to me so we both have fun and are safe. <br>  <br>  I kid you not, I no longer could walk in the room without this boy running up to love on me and grab my hand any time I had to leave for a couple minutes, and ask if he could go. NONE of the other teachers gave this boy a chance to change..In fact, they hurt him worse by calling him names. <br>  <br>  TAKE CONTROL of the situation that others have not and failed as a teacher and failed these kids. Have everyone sit down or be punished to stay in a corner..while you do this. Be consistent!!! Have them come up, 1 at a time, and explain that you are the teacher-NOT them, be sitting at their level-looking them in the face...Tell them, It is very important to them and yourself that they listen to you.. If there was an emergency, and they did not listen to you, they and you could be hurt in trying to get them to listen. Let them know, you want to be their friend as well as their teacher.<br>  <br>  Give them a sense of worth and praise them for listening and if they don't keep your punishment consistent if they don't. Let them know when the classroom is acting up, you will say, 1 2 3 and if they were NOT in their seat on FREEZE. they would be excluded in the next fun activity and sitting in the corner. <br>  <br>  Now, people may laugh or not realize how great this works, but I had MORE CONTROL over my kids, than their OWN parents!!!!!!!!!! Even if their parents were there, I still had more control. I'll unblock my email before Monday, PLEASE let me know next week how this goes. It may take a week to get through to these kids, but believe me, It will!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11540024	put them in time out, call or talk to the parents.

There are many ways to get in control of the classroom.  One thing is to praise those students who are doing a good job.  When you transition to another activity and you ask for the children to be doing something; but half the class isn't looking, you need to be looking at the part of the class that is doing what you asked.  Say, I want to thank (the child's name) for sitting (or whatever you asked them to do) like I asked.  And give him a sticker, or stamp.  Most of the kids will be running right over because they want a sticker or a stamp too.  I use a lot of incentives in my classroom.  I have a "Reach for the Sky" bulletin board in my room.  Each child has a star on the bulletin board.  There are two clouds on the board.  The goal is for each child to be in the top cloud before the day is over.  They will start off with their star at the bottom of the board.  If they are doing something good, their star will get moved up.  If they do something they are not supposed to, their star gets moved down.  If at the end of the day, their star is at the top, then they get a special treat out of the treasure box.  (you can find really cheap incentive toys online). If they are in the first cloud, they get a sticker (because they did at least one thing good).  Do not ever ever ever tell a child he is a bad child.  There will always be that one child who no matter what you do, does not want to comply.  The easiest thing to do is to make him feel like he is still in control even though you will actually be in control.  Give him choices.  Children will comply with you if you give them choices.  If you are wanting the children to sit down and listen to a book and one child is over playing with the blocks, tell him that he has a choice to sit on the carpet with the rest of the class or he can sit at the table (or somewhere else in the room) to listen to the story.  You are still getting what you want from him but, he still feels like he is control.  (and make sure that if he does comply, you give him positive feedback).  When a child is misbehaving, it can be really frustrating.  But, make sure you speak in a calm voice because children have an amazing insight into people.  They can see that you are frustrated and when that happens, their behavior worsens because they know that they have won.  Also, one thing that you have to remember is that the attention span is about 1 minute per year of the child.  So if you have a group of four year olds, you should not have them sitting for more than four minutes.  You need to provide hands on learning experiences in the classroom.  You should set up centers in the classroom that has materials in each center to explore.  Good luck to you!  You have a challenge ahead of you because it is always difficult to bring change to a classroom of four year olds!  It's not going to be a quick fix come Monday morning.  It's going to take a lot of work from you.  But, just stick to your guns and take it one day at a time.|`|BWVDKixeaa	You say the children are a little unruly so I'm taking it that no one is completely out of control (good thing). I'm a teacher currently teaching Grade 2 but most of my experience has been teaching  5 and 6 years olds. When the prep children first started school and I wanted them to do the right things I would use a number of POSITIVE strategies including..<br>  <br>  I would set a few VERY SIMPLE rules first and foremost. I would have them up in the room and share them with the group. Set a simple consequence like time out. When someone is following the rules you praise them regarding the rule Eg. I like the way you boys are sharing the game. Well done.<br>  <br>  Focus on those students who are doing the right thing and use that as a springboard Eg I really like the way Melanie is sitting so beautifully.  She has her legs crossed and hands in her lap. It shows me she is ready to listen.  Can we all see if we can sit like Melanie?  Wow I have a wonderful grade, I am so lucky! etc<br>  <br>  Sometimes (but certainly not always) I would give out stickers to a child doing something well.  Just looking out for any moment in time when those kids that don't do what you want, do the right thing and quickly praising them for their 'wonderful listening etc'.  <br>  <br>  Those children who are especially difficult may want to be your special 'helper' and help set up and activity, carry something for you or turn the pages of a book you are reading to the grade and that gives you a chance to say something positive to them.  Or say you are looking for people who are sitting beautifully etc to do such and such and quickly see if that child is doing it and choose them.  Of course not all the time but to start you off. They will associate your attention to them with only the positive things they do.  Negative attention is still attention and some kids thrive on ANY attention.<br>  <br>  If they say no then I would say to the rest of the grade Eg I have a special job I would like someone to help me with. Who would like to help me? Children even if they are always against what you say will think 'Oh no I really did want to do it' (they hate to see others being given something special opposed to them).  But remember it is a chance to give them some responsibility and provides opportunities to say something positive to them (if you are struggling to find some)<br>  <br>  If they ran around for lunch (that could be a rule- We sit nicely at our tables when we eat) then I would start by pointing out the children who are doing the right thing then go to the child out of their seat and say Eg 'You need to come and sit down because you are eating.  If you don't sit down you will miss out on our next fun activity' and walk away and ignore them.  When the time comes they miss out Eg. 'You didn't sit down when I asked you to.  Now you will need to sit out for a little bit.  Next time I am sure you will remember our very important rule.'  <br>  <br>  Be consistant. Thank them for sitting nicely in time out if that is what they do. Keep them there a little longer if they aren't. Say 'If you can sitting nicely in time out by the time the sand runs through (use a sandtimer maybe) then you can come and join us again.' They have something to focus on that they can see with their own eyes which shows them how long.<br>  <br>  Stay positive is my suggestion. Look for the good things and show the children that you notice them.  Be firm but also calm and consistant.  I understand where the post above is coming from because I too have had to physically restrain a child from their out of control behaviour. But this is only for very extreme and violent cases. I wouldn't do this just because a child is not sitting at their table to eat. But I would and have done it.<br>  <br>  Hope at least some of this helps.|`|QMxFhz3waa	I am a nursery teacher and my children are anywhere from the ages 3-4. <br>  The first thing you need to do is get them on the carpet and tell them that they are going to do something very important. They are going to make a special list of rules for their classroom. You can have some rules in your head but talk to the class, encouraging them to raise their hand and not shout out, about what rules they think you will all need and why. Have a big piece of paper ready and a marker. Make the list of rules and if possible draw pictures next to them so that they know what each rule means. <br>  <br>  This will give them respect of you and their classroom. It will make them feel like they have some kind of choice and like they are not just being told what to do by another adult. <br>  <br>  If you tell them that they are going to have a time out make sure you give them one. One minute for each year of their age. If they do not sit for the time out then send them next door to another teachers room to sit in the corner. (Not a room where their other friends are.)<br>  <br>  Most important! When they are on the carpet and moving around or getting up. Give the moving child a stern look and offer someone who is sat nicely a lot of praise. A good way to encourage this look and praise concept is use stickers at the end of carpet time and ONLY give them out to the children who sat well. Be sure to tell them you will giving out stickers to children who behave at the beginning of carpet time.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you.

rVqFTqCdaa	I'm also from Australia and actually work as a part-time tutor. I know many institutions will not offer tutoring to people who have not completed their HSC so you would have to canvas, put up signs as you said, or network a lot to get students. I would mention that you are in grade 11 and a high achiever (maybe include you School cert results). I would also advise that your students are years 7 & 8 only. The close nature of the ages between yr 9 or 10 students is unprofessional (maybe ok if its a guy), and many parents wouldn't be happy with their daughters tutor being so close in age.    My advice to you is to teach topics and subjects you know well. If you are tutoring Year 8 Maths borrow the text book and go through it and do some of the questions yourself. No matter what your tutoring make sure your prepared and have considered the following.    You need to consider where the student is coming from, what they may or may not understand already and how to help them understand. Your should ask yourself: What mite be hard for a student answering these questions if they were struggling? how to i break the question into easier steps? what questions could i ask the student to help them understand, and can i exlpain this simply?    About rates: I'm not sure maybe $10-15 an hour. I wouldn't be expecting to get a lot per hour if i was you. keep in mind university students tutor from anywhere between $15 - $25 an hour depending on subjects, age. and $30 or so for ESL.    GOODLUCK

c2YcBbXyaa	i agree with you that it should be  skate......|`|TNTFomKeaa	The book is correct. As the subordinate clause is enclosed in commas and thus can be taken out of the sentence, you do not count these people for your verb.Therefore you will use the third person singular form of the verb, skates.  If the sentence had begun Patricia and several of her friends i.e. without the commas enclosing the clause then you would use the third person plural form, skate. It's all about the commas.  I don't think there's much difference between Australian and American punctuation and grammar. It is British English that is significantly different. However as long as you stick to one style then you should be ok, whichever country you're in. I hope that helps.|`|I3CNklLKaa	It's fine, it's skates and no there isn't - respectively.|`|xhxnvPczaa	you are right it is skate. well done! the book might have made an error so don't get your hopes up that all of the book is perfect|`|YotyiNSyaa	the book is correct. it is skates.|`|qoh1iNi9aa	OK A clause is a sentence-like group of words within a sentence. It has a subject and a finite verb. If it is a main clause, it can stand on its own. Patricia skates every Friday morning is a main clause. It also demonstrates that "skates" is correct, despite what others may say. "Along with several of her friends" is a descriptive phrase. The subject of that clause is "Patricia, so the verb should be "skates"  A dependent clause (or subordinate clause as we say in England) depends for its existence on the main clause. It cannot stand on its own. "Because she enjoys the exercise" is a dependent clause. It does not make sense by itself. Dependent clauses usually start with words like because, after, although etc    Sorry, as an Englishman, I don't the answer to your second question, except to say we got there first!    Hope this helps.

An RA will be more apt to writing up someone for alcohol violations in a substance-free hall than a regular dorm too.|`|wFBVuBOkaa	You might get a roommate whose parents sign her up for substance-free, or someone who thinks "I won't be attracted to that stuff..." and then turns into a party hound once she gets away from home. It does happen.<br>  <br>  What substance-free should do is give you a failsafe if things do go wrong. If your "substance-free" roommate starts drinking and drugging, the dorm should be a lot less tolerant or willing to give the benefit of the doubt on that floor versus the others. Your roommate also doesn't have any reason to hate you for getting her kicked out - she knew what she was signing up for, right? You're not expected to "be cool about this" on a substance-free floor, and nobody has any right to ask that of you.<br>  <br>  (And if you do get into this situation and your roommate expects you to bend the rules, you can always lie and claim your brother/uncle/father is on substance x and used to beat you/is in jail/rehab and then start crying to make them look like a total jerk for even asking.)|`|ftKEfkWqaa	I guess you will have to get an apartment then.

AwWV4K5caa	The consensus is to group them heterogeneously as it is a more realistic example of the work environment. By being different, one should help the other. The smarter kids may use various modalities and can help a child with only one.Try it. If it doesn't work you can regroup. Good luck.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	Depends on the situation. But according to Kagan Cooperative Learning, you should rank your children from highest ability to lowest ability. According to Spencer Kagan "Heterogeneous teams have been preferred because they (1) produce the greatest opportunities for peer tutoring and support, (2) improve cross-race and cross-sex relations and integration, and (3) make classroom management easier -- having a high achiever on each team can be like having one teacher aide for every three students" (p. 6:1). Ideally you group your students in to groups of 4--one high-level, 2 mid-level, and one low-level. The idea is that the higher level student will help out the lower ones while getting leadership experience.<br>  <br>  While that's ideal, he also says, "if we always use heterogeneous teams, the high achievers would never interact (missing important academic stimulation) and the low achievers would never be on the same team (missing leadership opportunities)" (p. 6:1).<br>  <br>  I try to group mine heterogeneously, but I also have to group mine by who won't talk to each other. I have 12 students in my class and 3 groups of 4. I have 3 boys who don't work well together, so I automatically put them in separate groups. Then I work from there. I have one girl who has to be in a certain position because of her attention span (she needs a teacher in close proximity at all times to get anything done).<br>  <br>  Then, I also have several other things I group for. I am in the process of incorporating guided reading into the curriculum, so for our small group times they're grouped according to ability level. I have a high ability level, a middle, and a low level. Then we use leveled readers that go with their levels. That way they can all be successful while still learning the same skills.<br>  <br>  With group projects, I'll often do random groupings so the students have the opportunity to work with different peers. Some ways I do that is by spinning a spinner, drawing names, or even letting them select (once in a very great while, and even then I have a little say in how that happens).<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I'm all over the place. This is just my experience. I hope it helped.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	I don't think that there is one right answer, but I strongly believe that ability streaming in the elementary grades is effectively violence against children. It absolutely damages their ability to feel that they can improve. <br>  Bear in mind, even in an ability grouped class, you will still have a wide variety of learning styles! You should still be looking to teach to those styles and those students - regardless of the similarity of  their test scores.<br>  Personally, I have very fluid groups. My class is mixed ability. For math I usually ability group. These groups change depending on the topic we are looking at. Some children have stronger geometry skills but have difficulty telling the time, so they need to be in different groups.<br>  In reading I either group by reading age or by the skill level they have with a particular strategy. In a group working on inference, I might have 2 of my readers who read at 9-10 and 3 who read at 13-15 because they are all weak with inference.<br>  In other learning areas (science, social studies, health, PE etc) I tend to go for heterogeneous groups. I find it helpful if each group has at least one strong reader and writer, one student with artistic ability, one with strong leadership and organisational skills etc.<br>  I teach my children about Multiple Intelligences, emphasizing the fact that we all have "smarts" and that with work we can develop them. I find this more effective and less demoralizing than "You are in the low class, because that is who you are"<br>  If a teacher can't manage to differentiate instruction - at least in the years before junior high, they need to take a hard look at their own practice.|`|gerE7nZGaa	group them by social typing- jocks, nerds, home coming queens, etc., it's the only way they'll feel comfortable|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	The lack of grouping is one of the reasons why education is failing so dismally. It is impossible to accomodate everyone. It's just goverment bs with no real thought applied to it. It looks good on paper and is a failure. Students should be grouped according to ability for all subjects.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I do all kinds of groupings in my classroom. I mostly group by ability during 'Group Time'. But, there are other times when I group by skills needed or by just randomly choosing. The students don't really know what group they are in because I group so many different ways. Also, my ability groups can change from week to week.
c8DjmWXxaa	yes|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	Yes - but you cannot just do the free learning units - they are for your own perusal.<br>  <br>  To get a degree you need to select courses with accredited points, some are worth 10, 15, 30, 60 etc and there are three levels.<br>  <br>  You need at least 120 points from level one, same from level two and level three.  (Some courses like BSc in Psychology require more than this even.)<br>  <br>  A good place to start is a course for 10 points called an Openings - it is like a mini-version of the real thing and gives you an idea of what would be involved in the more common 60 point version.<br>  <br>  If you are on a low income you can even get financial help to pay course fees. <br>  <br>  Personally I found the OU better than a brick Uni and it is great to be able to work from home etc - you do need to be disciplined though, work hard etc<br>  <br>  Most people have doubts in the begininng (not sure if they make the grade or have the time or are capable etc) so quieten down those doubts and know you ARE capable and just take one step at a time.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  p.s And you DO NOT have to attend a lecture once a month - those tutorials are voluntary and many courses have phone or internet tutorials if you would rather that.  The courses are all however designed mostly as stand alone units meaning if you really want to you can complete them without help etc<br>  <br>  Contact the OU for advice they are excellent at explaining it all - do sieze the day and finally get the career you always wanted.  If you choose something you really are interested in then that is half the battle.|`|AA10988215	Yes you can.  The Open University does not have any 'on campus' students, everyone studies from home.  To get a BA or BSc (honours) degree you need to pass 360 points from their courses. Usually 120 of these points must be from level 2 courses, another 120 points must be from level 3 courses and the last 120 points can be from any level (1, 2 or 3), but the requirements may vary slightly across degrees.  If you want to get a degree without honours you must pass 300 points from their courses.  Some of these points (usually no more than 120) can be made up from study you have done elsewhere (e.g. at another uni or college)-this is known as a credit transfer.<br>  <br>  You can do 2 different types of degree.  An open degree can be made up of any mix of courses/topics so long as you pass the correct number of points at the required level.  A named degree (such as an English degree or a Biology degree) will have set courses that you must take to make up the majority of the points and usually only a few points are free for you to fill with any courses you want.<br>  <br>  The Open University send you the course materials that you need, such as books, dvds, cd's and computer software and guide you through each course.  There are optional tutorials that you only attend if you want to.  Some courses (around 1-2 per named degree) have compulsory residential schools, usually for 5 days or less.  If there are circumstances preventing you from attending you can do the work at home that would be done at residential school.  Most courses have exams and most exams are done in an exam centre (like a local hotel or university)-you must attend these, they cannot be taken at home.  On the whole though the majority of the degree is completed at home.<br>  <br>  Good luck if you study with the O.U, I think you will really enjoy it! :-)|`|chHPoiThaa	Yeah you will have to attend a lecture once or twice a month.<br>  You can get funding if you are on benifits and a grant for equipment.<br>  You gain at least 120 points a years which will become the 360 points that you need for the degree.<br>  It will take three years unless you want to pay extra for extra courses thus gaining extra points that you need.|`|AA11942204	Yes that is the point of OU. And it is one of the only distance education institutions worthy of respect. A degree from OU is a very good degree.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	Yes, that's the whole point of an Open University Course!!!!|`|X8fwBpsyaa	Smilie put things very well, although I should point out not all courses require 120 points from level one, 120 points from level two and 120 points from level three, if they did my degree wouldn't work as we only have one 60 point level one course and it's not compulsory. Most will require you take a certain number above level one, and at least 2 courses at level 3, but it does vary between courses, so check on the specification for the degree you want to see exactly which courses are needed. Theoretical speaking I could have done 5 level three courses and one level two course and still got my degree, but I chose to do the level one course to get used to degree level study. <br>  <br>  The three levels are roughly (and I do mean roughly) equivalent to your first, second and third year at university. So level one courses are usually fairly straight forward, level two courses are harder, and level three courses ask the most of you. This may be confusing since you can do them in any order you like (though they usually recommend you do level one courses before level two, and level two courses before level three.)<br>  <br>  But back to your origional question yes you can do your degree from home, that's what the OU is for! Most of the courses aren't exactly online though, they usually send you the course books (which are included in the price of the course) and you work through them at home (though there are usually lots of online resources you can take advantage of. There are tutorials, these are voluntary and usually happen around once a month (more if you're on a level one course), some of them are in the real world, others are online or by telephone, it depends on which course you take. <br>  <br>  So just look through their prospectus (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/)" rel="nofollow">http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/)</a> and see if there's anything that takes your fancy.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Yes totally, just go online and look through all their courses and it will tell you exactly what you need to do, I'm studting with them and it's great xxx
AA10023710	Either one would let you in. By having a year plus of US university under your belt, so long as your grades are good and the university is decent, you're eligible to apply, and may get in. However...<br>  <br>  Pre-med. There is no "pre-med" in the UK. You study medicine at the undergraduate level there. In other words, there, you study medicine for your bachelors degree. There is no separate "med school", like there is in the US. <br>  <br>  If you do study medicine overseas, be aware that there are certain hoops you must jump in order to be eligible to practice in the US. This includes, at minimum, doing a US residency, and since most residency spots are reserved for students at US med schools, getting one won't be simple. It's possible, but it's not easy. You'd want to look into that before you make your decision. <br>  <br>  You are certainly welcome to major in biology or etc. in the UK or Ireland. But some US med schools won't accept the med school pre-req classes if they were done overseas. Again, check into that before you decide what you're doing next. <br>  <br>  At worst, if you find staying where you are is your best option, do an exchange for a year to UCL or UCD. Then do your med school in the US, and do one of your residencies, if you'd like, overseas. Or do your med school, and then go on for a masters in, say, public health overseas. You'll have some options to incorporate some foreign studies into your life, if you want to.

FmvnC8keaa	There could be multiple explanations as to why you did not receive the main part. First of all, you may have received a main part in a previous play and she did not, therefor your teacher would have wanted to give someone else a try. Another explanation could be that maybe your teacher thought that the other girl was a better match for the part that was being auditioned for. Lastly, she could have been utterly annoyed and just wanted to make her stop talking.|`|UOMJhFHaaa	She thought the other girl possessed the abilities more than you.<br>  <br>  Quit being jealous.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Even though you find her annoying, she really let the teacher know how much she wanted the part.  When you really want something, you have to try hard at it.  It's not easy putting yourself out there when it comes to asking a teacher questions, etc.  Only problems is, that girl may lose her part if she can't sing... I would still let your teacher know (off to the side talk to her) that you are still very interested in the singing part b/c you love to sing & got what it takes... She will remember that.  If that "annoying girl " drops out of that part or the teacher wants to replace her, she will have you in mind.  Good Luck!|`|ezoKuZLgaa	While you may have percieved the girl's begging as annoying, the teacher could have seen it as dedication, and really wanting it. So she'll give the part to someone who shows that they really want this.<br>  <br>  It's all about how people may see things. Don't let it get to you, I'm sure they'll be other parts.

FwYoOvUIaa	i dont think a lot of the other answerers (sorry im not sure how to spell that) understand the concept of taking the SAT in 7th grade. The point of it is not to try and get 800's. For your age, these are quite good. Your critical reading score is quite good, considering that it is hard for someone at the age of 12-13 to get over a 500! and your 570 in math is good as well! You could definitely improve your writing skills for your essay and writing, but still overall well done! By the time you get to your junior year, your scores will probably be up in the 700's!|`|B6l03Vghaa	Yeah, your essay was perfect, your other scores are average but you will get good scores later if you continue doing the test again.

The highest you can get is 800 on each section and 12 on the writing section. Aim for 600 and 8-10 for the essay.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh wait, you're only in 7th grade? Then you're fine.

oZ39bLSkaa	Hi,<br>  Your little guy is five, and doing great! And you helped him along the way, even while you were busy with the other little ones.<br>  <br>  Please consider just keeping him at home. His curiosity alone will keep him learning. <br>  <br>  You likely do not even need to bother getting  a curriculum. You can go to the library, give him educational toys and so on, If you need a program, try Sonlight. It is literature rich ,meant to be read aloud, but he could read some and you could read some. The other kids might learn the valuable skill of listening while you red and they play quietly.Enforce a communial nap time and either make that the time you decompress or time youspend some one on one with him.<br>  <br>  Kids who teach themselves how to read cannots stand the traditional phonics programs. In my experience it is good to have a reference book on hand and teach phonics as it seems required. It takes very little teaching as you know. <br>  <br>  When children are bright and perhaps even mature for their age, one can mistakenly assume they are is mature at every level. You may find you can be asking too much of your child at times because he does certain things so easily. I just caution you to remember, he is still just a little kid! <br>  <br>  I discourage you from sending him to school. What would be the point? You have clearly proved that you provide a great learning environment. I doubt you need it for free baby sitting, and that is what it would be. And at what cost? An exhausted child that is turned off learning? It just not worth it.Plus, when he gets home, you will probably be too exhausted to spend any time with him.<br>  <br>  This is a trememndously busy time in you life. Some days I am sure it feels like it will never end, and I know it is exhausting. but I trust you are enjoying it too! Hang in there! Perhas this book might help you <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Childrens-Sake-Child-Life-Book/dp/089107290X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Childrens-Sake-C...</a><br>  <br>  This book can set the vision in your mind for the type of education we all want to provide for our children -- warm, intelligent, full of life. A living education full of living books, living ideas, living people! A chance for our children to learn about the world they live in at their own pace.<br>  <br>  All the best as you sort it out.|`|0uoUUAPzaa	I'd put him in public school at his regular grade level and try to find out if he can skip a grade or go into an accelerated program. Most public schools have them, but if yours doesn't, he could probably move up a grade or 2 just for reading. I know a couple kids who did that. My brother is in 2nd grade, but reads at a 6th grade level and is at a 5th grade level in math. He is in an accelerated program called AIM. There is probably something similar at your local school.|`|MoaIQPvCaa	I would get in touch with Charity Christian Academy, they have experience in working with gifted and profoundly gifted students.

(:|`|vGRSTarTaa	whatever you do do not put him in public school. he will loose all he has learned and l his true potential will not be reached, they wont even try. believe me i have been there. the best thinh you can do is homeschool him, he already has the foundation! he can read well, and if you can read and write , you can learn ANYTHING. dont worry about this or that curriculum, a full scripted curriculum has never worked for us or anyone we know.  find other homeschool moms, ask them questions, get online and find one or two or 50 of the thousands of websites for people just like you who really dont know where to begin, thats how i started. <br>  research curriculums and its easy to put your own together. think of what you want him to learn, math, history, things like that, and then hunt on line for info and products that will fit your bill.<br>  i am using rod and staff, some things from lovetolearn.net and a few other places, but you can do it. i hate grade levels too, just let him lern at his own pace, dont rush him or slow him down, maybe he is great at math, but just cant get english down pat, so slow down the english and pump up the math. <br>  we have 4 children too, and hope for more and this is not a problem, our youngest is 2 rightnow, and weve schooled with a newborn at home too. other moms you meet in person or on line can give you pointers. email me for more info, ill be glad to help! you just have to change your mind, that learning is not just a set thing that must be done at a certain time in a certain way. it is life, life is learning and the world a school room. i wish i could burn every book that is supposed to tell you what your kid should know and when. they are trash. just surround him with lots of books and enriching videos and things like workbooks are just fine for the rest,<br>  <br>  accelerated christian education, rod and staff, bob jones university, mott publishers, school zone, love to learn(this will help you alot), sonlight, alpha-omega, lifepacs are great, key to, wordly wise, grammer simplified, harcourt, our fathers world, apologia science, sun light makes a good penmanship course. there are as many companies as there are people to buy them, youll find what fits your sons and other childrens needs.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	You can homeschool with younger children.  Do things with them all at the same time, as much as possible.  You'll probably find that the little ones will want to be included and the kindergartner will not likely be ready to work independently yet.  But if you get them all involved, your 5 yr. old will learn much more at home, in much less time, than he would in a public school class where he'd be bored (and prehaps likely to get into trouble because of it.)<br>  <br>  My children were similar.  I didn't use prepackaged curriculum for reading at that age.  I did teach mine phonics rules--especially vowel and consonant combinations, just to make sure that they'd know how to tackle larger unfamiliar words--I just used a simple workbook from a discount store--if he's bright enough to be reading already, you don't need to worry about which program to use.  Teaching him spelling rules is another way to make sure that he gets all of the phonics rules.<br>  <br>  I found that reading programs for kindergarten seemed to focus on pre-reading and basic reading skills that were too basic for my children.  So, we did lots of reading of library books.<br>  <br>  We did a lot of read alouds that all the children would listen to.  We read through "The Story of the World" for history.  The little ones listened or drew pictures of the story; even the tiny ones liked being read to and listened.<br>  For science, we used a lot of "Bill Nye, the Science Guy" and "Magic School Bus" videos from the library.  We also planted seeds and took care of them in our tiny garden.  We collected seeds from foods we ate and labeled them.  We took a lot of nature walks and got a membership at the zoo.  Those sorts of things even the little ones got into.<br>  We did a number of lapbook or unit projects, where we'd spend a couple of weeks reading books from the library on a topic.  Sometimes the children picked the topic; sometimes I did.<br>  Mostly, I used "Making the Grade:  Everything Your Kindergartner Needs to Know" as the skeleton of our lessons; but I ignored the reading sections as our children were well beyond them--instead, we stuck with library books.<br>  <br>  When my son was in kindergarten, we did "lessons" only a couple of times a week for an hour or so at a time for the first few months.  He wasn't ready for more, and I found that with that little time, he was quickly learning more than the children I knew who were in public school kindergarten.  So, it won't be as big a committment of time as you might think.<br>  <br>  Good luck

SOkPWJ6qaa	There are several variations between the conclusion of the book and the movie. In the book, Juliet talks about the fears of taking the poison, while in the movie, no such dialogue is presented. Among the changes that were made to accommodate a new time frame, the method of Juliet’s demise was changed from a knife-inflicted wound to a gunshot. At last, one final distinction is the findings of Romeo and Juliet’s bodies. Shakespeare has the church watchman find their bodies while the movie has police discover them.

81sucrAEaa	I am currently majoring in Cognitive Systems/Science which is the study of artificial intelligence/robotic. It's a multidisciplinary degree that incorporates computer science/ programming as well as delving in current research work with experts from many different fields from big universities ranging from linguistical and mechanical perspectives of creating an intelligent robotic agent. What i mean is that there is no specific degree for robotics but incorporates things from many fields. My profs that do this stuff got doctoral degrees from one distinct aspect of robotics such as programming and collaborates with others from electrical/computer engineering. After the degree you should volunteer to join different doctoral robotics research labs or get a second degree to bolster your experience. I too was in your position because I thought robotics was cool. But beaware that many people see no implications these days for complicated robots because it is far too difficult and to some useless of an endeavour.<br>  If you look at several different robot companies such as "I,Robot" which invented the robot vacuum they hire people from computer science backgrounds and electrical engineering backgrounds.|`|qhKP68eiaa	Electrical or Mechanical Engineering.  Double check with the university you're interested in and they should have an alumni link as to who employs their graduates.  SHould get you started in the right direction at least!|`|5rP0zBudaa	I think the most interesting robotics involves computer programming as the main part of it. It depends what type of robotics you are interesting. The majority of it involves making machines for industry.|`|kB63WTfdaa	Electrical Engineering or mechanical engineering,.
y4CXrGTVaa	It does really vary by school, building, and occupancy. However I think the averages range from 10-15 feet by 12-16 feet (at least at my school).|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	It honestly depends. A single, a dorm meant for just one person, is going to be smaller than a triple, one meant for three people to share. It depends on the number of people living in the dorm, if there are any extra rooms like a private bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc.
lQIKWXDuaa	I will say apply to at least nine schools. My best advice to you is to research the school to see which ones suit your social, academic and financial need. Also see if they matches your stats (GPA, etc...). Apply to three with stats better than yours, three that are equal to yours and three that are less than yours. This way you will increase your chance in getting into one of them. But dont apply to every PA school in the US. Pick a region. Do you like west coast, the east coast, the south or the midwest.  Also make sure you apply to PA programs within your state's school.<br>  <br>  ss
AA10023710	I disagree with the first poster. No need to add any more extra curriculars. Those you have are fine, so long as you do something meaningful in at least one of them. The tutoring is very nice, as is the hospital work. <br>  <br>  Your stats do put you on track as a possible for Harvard. You look good. But as I'm sure you know, Harvard lets in only 9% of its applicants. You may be perfect and still get rejected, so do apply, but have backup schools.|`|ertDGSthaa	It is all very impressive but it might not be enough. I'm not trying to put you down. All I am saying is that I applied to Harvard with a 4.3, a 2450 SAT a 34 ACT, and a little more extracurricular activities than you have, and I was put on the waiting list. I didn't get into the institute, but I did get into Yale. You still have a lot of time to improve though. Apply to as many colleges as possible. If you keep up the good work, you will definitely get into a very good school. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you get what you want!|`|uhCugjNdaa	Have you taken the SAT yet? Also, any SAT IIs?<br>  <br>  You definitely have a shot based on the credentials you listed. I'm sure the recommendation letter from a Harvard Alumnus will help as well.<br>  <br>  But the thing with Harvard (and the other Ivy Leagues), is that there are never any guarantees. Even if you are the perfect candidate in every way, you can't guarantee acceptance.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope everything works out for you|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	I think in finding your chances, we must start with the opposite. What aren't your chances? Are you a minority? Are you anything but caucasian? Times are changing. The only way to make it to the top now is to be a minority. <br>  <br>  Suggestions: When you go in for an interview, wear a pin that says "I <3 Obama."|`|U7EWuA8haa	No one can say... Just apply and you will see... don't be afraid to try - it may change your life... If you don't get there - try a more simple school at first and then try again in Harvard for you master's degree!<br>  I wish you luck :)|`|788d7c7ce9ee2dd89f47d95303ca9817aa	with more extra curricular activities, i'd say you're looking pretty good.|`|Wzi2Zll7aa	I know that ACT's are the main test to take where you live, but on the east coast we focus a lot on SAT's. I took both, even though it was hard to find an ACT test center, because sometimes a different style test can give you better results, and most schools take either or. If you can get to an SAT test center, I suggest taking it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, all your stuff looks good!<br>  Good luck!|`|BrURsmNgaa	even though by your stats you look pretty good, harvard is an extremely hard school to get into. i say your chances are about 1 to 250|`|ZHvi5Kr0aa	You have great chances, but Harvard accepts only a select few. Many valedictorians don't get accepted.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that try finding out something that no one else has.

Although, you always do hear of prisons being overcrowded so they end up releasing the elderly prisoners who ended up with life sentences. So maybe if an 80 year old was brought back to life...then they would let him go (but they may have done that anyway). <br>  <br>  Besides, scientists have kind of changed the definition of death to mean cessation of brain activity rather than the heart stopping.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	WoW|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Why bring them back?|`|E2GGUEBSaa	I'm no expert, but I'd say if the prisoner were revived, then they would have to resume their sentence, after they recovered enough in a hospital.<br>  If you died, but came back, then you're alive, so you have to serve your time! An interesting question though!|`|HUMtdCdWaa	No, even if they were declared legally dead they're still living the same life, personality, memories, and past mistakes included.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	A life sentence is not a sentence until you die but a long sentence such as 60-70 years.  Therefore even being declared legally dead and then coming back would not free you from said sentence.|`|5wYfNbV6aa	Theoretically, they could. <br>  <br>  Whether or not they would win that argument is probably unlikely.

AA10023710	What is your goal? Do you want to be a dentist? If so, then you can major in anything you'd like, including health studies. It doesn't matter. But during college, you'll have to take certain pre-health classes, including:<br>  - 1 year bio with lab<br>  - 1 year general chemistry with lab<br>  - 1 year organic chemistry with lab<br>  - 1 year physics with lab<br>  - Math at least through statistics, and possibly, for certain med schools, through calculus<br>  - College level English<br>  - additional science classes, to your preference<br>  <br>  You can take some of those at the community college, but you should also save some for the university you transfer to. At the absolute minimum, at the cc, I want you to take the math and the English, plus the bio and some of the chem. You should also take the other classes required for you to be able to transfer to a university. Speak to your academic advisor at the cc, and make sure she knows you want to transfer to a university at some point. <br>  <br>  I'd really like it if you could do volunteer work at your local hospital, or in another health-related setting.

IGYa2yF6aa	Good question! I'm a bit of a business book junky so this topic fascinates me. I'm particularly interested in how certain actions/decisions affect the bottom line - especially things that are out of the box. I'd suggest looking at how going green can have a positive effect on a company's bottom line. It's timely, edgy, and interesting when you look at the recent studies that are coming out of universities and industry organizations.<br>  <br>  You can get more specific by focusing on a particular green methodology. For example, I recently read some very interesting NASA research about how having living plants in an office building can result in a 325% ROI due to improved productivity, reduced absenteeism (through reduced sick building sickness), higher employee morale, and several other factors. <br>  <br>  Most people (wrongly) that this is new territory and any information would be speculative. Actually, NASA has been studying it for nearly 20 years and numerous universities and industry organizations have published their findings from research and case studies. I have a file full of these studies because I've used it to create marketing materials for a company that offers related services. In a "green city" such as the one where I live, there are numerous consulting firms that are using the same research to help their corporate clients go green while taking advantage of financial, environmental, and tax benefits.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Good luck with your work!|`|VZ21gL81aa	You should then, by my calculations, be just about done with your coursework, and ready for comps real soon. You should by now have a mentor/dissertation committee chair. Talk to him/her about what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Oh the 'green' idea is cool, but it would at this point be all projection, little has been done on it yet, therefore it would be an 'exploratory' study. Some institutions frown on that research design. <br>  <br>  Two ideas: <br>  <br>  Traditional MBA programs, while differing in focus between schools, offer similar coursework and train students to think along traditional lines. These traditional lines of thinking have been the driving force behind most of the business activities that have led to the current business and economic crisis.<br>  <br>  <br>  #2<br>  The New York Post recently published a controversial political cartoon. Protestors are calling for a boycott of the Post and all of its advertisers. This call for political correctness will cause the paper to shut down,and put close to 15000 new people onto unemployment roles, plus the trickle-down effect on other businesses, thus exacerbating the current economic downturn. To what degree is it socially responsible to shut down a business in the face of rightwous public indignation?

ACE the ACT and you will be straight.    ss|`|ZGUkizjYaa	At least a 30 on the ACT, 32 is a guarantee|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Yes you can and you have a good shot - virtually (but not quite) a shoe in I would say.    Thanks  Bill|`|hEFthejvaa	your GPA should get at least a 3.7 overall but a 3.6 is acceptbale. the classes you took look good but i think you should join a few clubs or teams at your school. your ACT scores will also affect the administrators decision so make sure you practice on it thoroughly. also, there will be 3 essays you'll need to write: one is to write what makes your unique culturally or different from "average" students, & for the second essay you'll need to write why you want to enter the school of engineering. i forgot what the 3rd essay was, sorry.    heads up the college of engineering is really tough (about half eventually graduate) but it will be VERY rewarding if you manage to get a bachelor's & maybe a master's if you choose. best of luck! by the way i'm not sure if you already applied but the deadline to join next fall is either today or was yesterday :/

Take a variety of classes, even ones you don't think you'll enjoy as much.    I hated chemistry and physics in high school.  Biology was ok but definitely not my favorite class.  I finished a degree in anthropology before switching to nursing - go figure!      You don't have to have it figured out now.  You don't even have to have it figured out when you're a freshman in college.  I think the people that are happiest with their choice are people who did some soul searching and experimenting with classes throughout high school and the first year or two of college.|`|3blw5udRaa	you should major in something you are passionate.

I really liked that course, and it deals a lot with Cultures and History of certain time periods.     I'm actually a Biology major, but I am getting a Minor in Art History :D    Good English skills are a plus because there is a lot of analytical writing involved.     This is my suggestion; but in the end, it's all up to you.     Good luck, and enjoy your time in High School.
ThKkn5fKaa	Are you speaking of high school transcripts or college senior year grades?  If you are applying for undergrad, they both need all of your high school transcripts.  If you are applying for a graduate degree, they need all of your college transcripts, up to your most recent grading period.    I recently applied as an undergrad transfer to both Pitt and Penn State, and despite my having graduated from high school in 2003, they still made me send my transcripts.|`|FcqOie0zaa	I believe that my guidance counselor sent my first quarter grades to Penn State, but after I was accepted, they didn't see anything else.|`|GWZmNX92aa	A good way to find out would be to go to www.collegeboard.com   They have info. on mostly all of the college like grade transcripts. But I do think that all colleges require Senior grades to be sent. They're the most important. Good luck :)

There are only five possible positions open,  You have 36 possible characters for each position.  So you would take 36^5 power because it would be 36 possible for position one, x 36 for position 2 x etc....so it would be A.  It has been a long time but I am pretty sure that is correct.

mOgdarRIaa	You can read this from:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas    The Himalaya Range or Himalayas for short (Sanskrit: ??????, IPA pronunciation: [h?'mlij?]), meaning "abode of snow" [2]), is a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. By extension, it is also the name of a massive mountain system that includes the Karakoram, the Hindu Kush, and other, lesser, ranges that extend out from the Pamir Knot.    The Himalayan mountain system is the planet's highest and home to the world's highest peaks, the Eight-thousanders, which include Mount Everest and K2. To comprehend the enormous scale of this mountain range consider that Aconcagua, in the Andes, at 6,962 m (22,841 feet), is the highest peak outside Asia, whereas the Himalayan system includes over 100 mountains exceeding 7,200 meters (23,622 feet).[1]    The Himalayan system, which includes outlying subranges, stretches across six countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Some of the world's major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Yangtze, rise in the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 1.3 billion people. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in both Hinduism and Buddhism.    The main Himalaya range runs, west to east, from the Indus river valley to the Brahmaputra river valley, forming an arc 2,400 km long (1,491 miles), which varies in width from 400 km in the western Kashmir-Xinjiang region to 150 km in the eastern Tibet-Arunachal Pradesh region. The range consists of three coextensive sub-ranges, with the northern-most, and highest, known as the Great or Inner Himalayas.|`|6vJQduumaa	go here  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas  or  here becasue it is more easy to understand  http://www.xs4all.nl/~vpmedia/himalayas-...  hope this helps and gd luck|`|MrnLdm9Uaa	The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This is referred to as a fold mountain.    The collision began in the Upper Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate, moving at about 15 cm per year, collided with the Eurasian Plate. About 50 million years ago, this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards. The Arakan Yoma highlands in Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a result of this collision.    The Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into Asia. About 20 mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.

Your teacher probably wrote them specifically to get you thinking about the topic.  Have you read the book?  It's tough to write an essay without reading the book.  Read the book first.  Think about justice -- that's where the word "just" come from (in this context.)  Then actually go through the process your teacher outlined.  THEN if you still need help, post again.  But The Process as you wrote it seems very helpful already -- do it.

They are being sensitive to other peoples feelings, something that I am sure God would approve of, but it is also my opinion that no-one should consider that their feelings matter more than anothers. God does not - all men are equal.     You can still be a good Christian and uphold Christian values without believing in the Bible "religiously".

Perhaps it began when the Hebrews said to themselves that it was forbidden to pronounce the name of God (  Original Hebrew: YHWH , German translation: Jehovah ), and substituted words such as Eloi, (Lord) in it's place.  Today we have Jeez and gee whiz.  Hocus pocus used by magicians, came from a mocking of the Latin mass. (In hoc corpus).  It is not uncommon to hear a "Holy Cow" these days as well as a number of other substitute expression.

c9NuCZnaaa	-The BIOS hasn't detected the hard drive    -You have an incorrect Master Boot Record    -The hard drive itself is damaged    -One of your partitions is marked as 'active' when it shouldn't be    -The partition containing the Master Boot record is no longer set as Active    Those are the general causes of the problem but how do you get your pc up and running again.    1. The first line of defense is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)    2. Reboot your PC and, at the appropriate time, tap the Del key or whatever key your pc requires to enter the BIOS.    3. Check in the Standard CMOS Setup that your hard drive is listed.    4. Assuming your Hard Drive is listed then you can rule out the BIOS as being the problem.    5. If it isn't listed in the BIOS you will need to check your PC manual to see what settings you need to alter to auto-detect the hard drive. If this fails you may need to manually insert the hard drive settings.    6. Once you have ruled out the BIOS you should start to look at the Master Boot Record. Insert your XP CD into the CD-ROM and allow setup to begin. At the Welcome to Setup screen press 'R' to open the Recovery Console. This is a command line interface. You will need to select which operating system you are using from the available list and then insert your administrator password. If you are using XP Home then ignore the administrator password (unless you have set one yourself) and simply press Enter.    7. Recovery Console will now run    8. At the command prompt type: fixmbr  and press Enter    9. If fixing the Master Boot Record doesn't do the trick it may be worth checking to see if the partition that windows is installed on is actually Active. Obviously, if you only have one partition on your system and that contains Windows XP then that will, naturally, be set as the active partition. This option is more for those users with dual boot systems where you have an operating system on drive C: and drive D: If you have used a third party application, such as Partition Magic to create a partition you may have inadvertently made the D drive active thus cutting off the C: drive which contains the start up files. A quick way of finding out is to try booting up with an Emergency Start-Up Disk. If you can boot up with the Start-up disk go to Control Panel and click the Administrative Tools Icon followed by the Computer Management icon. When the Computer Management window opens click the Disk Management option on the left of the disk management pane. In the disk management window - lower half - make sure that the C: drive say's 'Healthy System' Also, if you can boot from an Emergency Start Up Disk you know your hard drive hasn't expired.    10. If you can start you machine with an Emergency Start Up Disk go to Control Panel, click on Administrative Tools followed by Computer Management. Finally the click the Disk Management option. Now right click on the drive you want to make Active and select 'Mark partition as active' from the drop down menu. Alternatively, if you have a copy of Partition Magic you can use this to actually reset the correct partition as the Active system drive.    11. If none of the above rectify the problem it is, unfortunately, safe to say that your hard drive is on it's last legs and is in need of replacement.      I'd suggest getting the hard drive fixed or replaced.
EBrgRBT3aa	Criticism    Western countries have criticized ASEAN for being too "soft" in its approach to promoting human rights and democracy in the junta-led Myanmar. Despite global outrage at the military crack-down on peaceful protesters in Yangon, ASEAN has refused to suspend Myanmar as a member and also rejects proposals for economic sanctions. This has caused concern as the European Union, a potential trade partner, has refused to conduct free trade negotiations at a regional level for these political reasons. International observers view it as a "talk shop", which implies that the organization is "big on words but small on action".    During the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, several activist groups staged anti-globalization and anti-Arroyo rallies.[68] According to the activists, the agenda of economic integration would negatively affect industries in the Philippines and would cause thousands of Filipinos to lose their jobs. They also viewed the organization as "imperialistic" that threatens the country's sovereignty. A human rights lawyer from New Zealand was also present to protest about the human rights situation in the region in general.    ASEAN has agreed to an ASEAN human rights body which will come into force in 2009. The Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand want this body to have an enforcement capacity, however Singapore, Viet Nam, Burma, Laos and Cambodia do not.    THE GOOD:     Free Trade Area    The foundation of the AEC is the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), a common external preferential tariff scheme to promote the free flow of goods within ASEAN.[44] The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is an agreement by the member nations of ASEAN concerning local manufacturing in all ASEAN countries. The AFTA agreement was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore. When the AFTA agreement was originally signed, ASEAN had six members, namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vietnam joined in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997, and Cambodia in 1999. The latecomers have not fully met the AFTA's obligations, but they are officially considered part of the AFTA as they were required to sign the agreement upon entry into ASEAN, and were given longer time frames in which to meet AFTA's tariff reduction obligations.    Comprehensive Investment Area    The ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Area (ACIA) will encourage the free flow of investment within ASEAN. The main principles of the ACIA are as follows        * All industries are to be opened up for investment, with exclusions to be phased out according to schedules      * National treatment is granted immediately to ASEAN investors with few exclusions      * Elimination of investment impediments      * Streamlining of investment process and procedures      * Enhancing transparency      * Undertaking investment facilitation measures    Full realization of the ACIA with the removal of temporary exclusion lists in manufacturing agriculture, fisheries, forestry and mining is scheduled by 2010 for most ASEAN members and by 2015 for the CLMV (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam) countries.    Trade in Services    An ASEAN Framework Agreement on Trade in Services was adopted at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in December 1995.Under the agreement, ASEAN members are negotiating intra-regional services liberalization in several sectors, including air transport, business services, construction, financial services, maritime transport, telecommunications and tourism. Although some sectors have liberalized faster, such as air transport, other sectors remain subject to continued negotiation. Efforts to expand the scope of the Framework Agreement also remain subject to continued negotiations.    ANSWER

That does not mean that we (speaking as a parent) don't get selfish because when I read your post I see your parents guilting you into taking care of them and I too felt that with my parents. <br>  <br>  I don't know how old your parents are (and age really isn't even a factor here) but it's quite possible that they have Old timey beliefs because we had to take care of our parents 100 yrs ago.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about this for now if you are years away from graduating. Sometimes you just have to let them have it their way for some time. If it was about the "big bucks" then they'd obviously want you to become a surgeon, a lawyer but instead a field that does not require the countless years of medical school that a doctor does... so that tells you that it's about keeping you close to them.<br>  <br>  Another thing you must keep in mind is that in order to pursue your dream without having a fat trust fund, you will have to find a way to survive while you write because as good as your writing may be, there are many many people who are also holding on to a manuscript and waiting for their big shot.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|lUO6wLGAaa	Being an author is NOT being stupid!!!

G33E41IBaa	If that is your unweighted GPA, or your school doesn't do grades over a 4.0, then you've got a great chance at all of those schools, except maybe MIT and U Penn.  You will get into NYU very easily, and you've got a great chance at Cornell and U Chicago.  However, I think the only thing that's holding you back from U Penn and MIT is your SAT score.  It should be around a 2200 for both of those schools.  However, your SAT II's, GPA, and extracurriculars are great so you've still got a decent chance of getting into those schools.  Also, if you have great recommendations, and a kickass essay and interview, you'll do fine :)<br>  <br>  This is the order of your chances at these schools, starting with the easiest:<br>  NYU<br>  U Chicago<br>  Cornell<br>  U Penn<br>  MIT<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Fxb2eKcLaa	show off|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	It sounds as if you have an excellent chance to get into any university you apply to.

ykl3y6zzaa	i love the part where Soda Darry and Pony are talking after Soda runs out of the house. and where dallas gives johnny and pony money and a gun. they just always stuck out to me. This is my favorite book ever.|`|ktOqm7cgaa	Frivolous?  Not compared with many of the questions I have encountered recently.  Here are a few lines and situations of many that I remember from the book that I read 35 years ago and still have in my library.  (I have not seen the film.)<br>  <br>  FROM CHAPTER 1:  I recall the teasing, chilling threat that is yelled at Ponyboy by one of the Socs while he is alone on the street:<br>  "How'd you like that haircut to begin just below the neck?" <br>  <br>  FROM CHAPTER 4:  I remember the cold, hard, sad description of Dally's life view.  <br>  <br>  [Ponyboy and Johnny had been confronted by five Socs at night in the park.  Two of them, Bob and Randy, threaten Ponyboy and Johnny.  One of them pushes Ponyboy into a fountain and holds him under water.  Johnny fears for Ponyboy's life; and when Ponyboy regains consciousness, he sees Johnny with a bloody knife and Bob on the ground bleeding.  Ponyboy believes that Johnny has killed Bob; and he panics.  They go to Buck Merril's place (a place that Ponyboy is not to go) to get advice from Dally.] <br>  <br>  Dally listens to the story and calmly congratulates Johnny for killing Bob. The narrator uses this description of Dally:<br>  "The fight for self-preservation had hardened him against caring." <br>  <br>  FROM CHAPTER 7:  A poignant line from Ponyboy when the brothers (Ponyboy, Sodapop and Darry) ask the doctor about the injuries to Dally and Johnny (their friends and fellow greasers).  The doctor tells them that Dally will be ok, but that Johnny has a broken back, bad burns, and may die. <br>  <br>  Ponyboy says:<br>  "I wanted to cry, but greasers don't cry in front of strangers. Some of us never cry at all. Like Dally and Two-Bit and Tim Shepard--they forgot how at an early age."<br>  <br>  FROM CHAPTER 10:  How "bad" is Dally?  Is he "tougher" in all ways than Ponyboy?  <br>  <br>  Ponyboy wonders, <br>  "How can I take it? Dally is tougher than I am. Why can I take it when Dally can't?" <br>  <br>  It is then that Dally calls and tells the boys that he has robbed a store and is being chased by the police.  They go to help Dally, but when they get to the lot, the police are already there. Dally pulls out a gun, a gun that Dally has told Ponyboy wasn't not loaded.  <br>  <br>  Dally then commits suicide.  No, he doesn't shoot himself; he lets the police do it!  He pulls out the gun; the police don't know that it isn't loaded; and they shoot him.  Ponyboy realizes that Dally wanted the police to kill him.

ktOqm7cgaa	The quote appears as follows:<br>  "Goddamned stupid people," Alice would say, "I'd like to shove life down all their throats and then maybe they'd understand what it's all about."<br>  <br>  The quote is from a book titled, "Go Ask Alice," by Anonymous (Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing - September 14, 1971).  The author of the novel is NOT identified.  Some think that Beatrice Sparks, editor of other tales (e.g., "Jay’s Journal," "It Happened to Nancy," and "Annie’s Baby") is the anonymous author.   <br>  <br>  The book purports to be the diary of a fifteen-year-old girl, Alice, who becomes involved in the "drug culture" during the mid to late 1960s; and who, after experimentation in the dark world of drugs, abuse, and prostitution, dies of an overdose. <br>  <br>  Alas, I do not have a page reference at hand.  The book was first published in 1971; however, it has been printed several times since, each printing by Simon & Schuster.

f285568aeaf5a37eb8f62ae89c326ce9aa	I went to a University right out of high school and hated it. To many students in one class, taught by graduate students, etc. SO i transferred to a community college. I have had most of my classes taught by PhD graduates and have no more then 30 students in my classes also the schedule of classes are usually more flexible then that of a university. I like my community college.|`|eNh87JYvaa	I'm currently studying at a top tier University as a freshman, but I've personally know at least 2 or 3 kids here who have transferred in from a community college and are doing just fine; they're pretty smart.<br>  <br>  I guess the real thing for me is whether the person going to community college legitimately wants an education and goes for financial reasons (or otherwise) or whether it's to get out of going into the job market.<br>  <br>  The point is, if the student at community college is going because they really want an education yet can't get into stronger colleges, it's perfectly fine; that's what community colleges are for.  However, I think it's often better to at least try to work something out with financial aid if that's the real problem.|`|iLH0ptcJaa	I got my AA at a community college and then transferred to a University.  While I was attending the community college, I hated that it was so small and lacked diversity (this was my particular experience, some are large and diverse I assume).  The University is better because a bachelor's degree is better than an associate's degree.  But honestly, school is what the student puts into it.  Some of the best teachers I've ever had were at that community college.  The classes were smaller at the community college, the teachers know you and you know them, and that offers an opportunity to get the most out of a class, whereas at the U my classes are large, and I am just a number.  Hope this helps...|`|Rq8dD51caa	im going to a community college and all my teachers say that u get a higher quality education here, and at universities they have said that they are only there for fame and reaserch and ndont really care if ur failing. at comunity they do care and try to help you find more resourses and thery become kinda like ur frinds, and its MUCH CHEAPER!!!|`|DIi01Cugaa	Hi,<br>  My boyfriend's aunt went to a community college.

And they make less money.<br>  <br>  This is not to say they will not have a good life. But overall, they will not do as well financially. Provided you select your university major properly. There are many university majors that pay no better than a community college degree, specially ones that give you a BA degree. The BS degrees are the best.|`|933XLRGCaa	I loved it.<br>  <br>  I went to a community college and had a good experience. I was a little bummed to go at first; I had graduated from high school with a 4.4 GPA, and felt I should have gone to a university, but money was an issue for me.  <br>  <br>  I got rid of those feelings once I started though, and I realized that community college is just like regular college, except even more easy and convenient. They have a wide variety of classes at many times, to fit the needs of working professionals.  Though there are a lot of lazy people and screw-ups, I met some people who were in my same situation and enjoyed their friendship.  <br>  <br>  It was a good thing I went to community college because they don't have a limit on how many units you take, so I took a whole bunch, and was able to be done with my general education in a year.  Then I transferred to a university, where I was ahead in my studies.  Also, it is easier to get into a university when you're a transfer student.  <br>  <br>  I know it's hard to avoid the stigma of going to a community college, but once you transfer, people at universities really don't care or ask where you came from.  And employers only look at where you got your degree, not where you started out.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

mrysAOpGaa	did you ever hear the saying "life flashed before my eyes"? someone who faces a near death experience thinks about all of the things in their life, current and future, because thats all that they can think about or want to think about before they die, they think about whats missing now, and how it could affect their future, so when they survive it, their whole outlook on life changes.  So i believe what he is saying is that live life day to day. live your life to the fullest, dont worry about suck minute things, try to push others who havent experienced it to live life to the fullest because they know first hand that life can be taken in an instant, and not to always fear the uknown because yo uDONT know what could and will happen, but to be full of life, keep those you love close to you..thats my interprataion on that:) hope it helps
59c71f9051e2713a52eccd96d53ae7adaa	I think the first step you should take is by looking at everything differently. Look at things around you, and find something special about it that makes you attract towards it. Like video games attract kids, because it is very different and sparks interest in them. <br>  <br>  You can't be really creative instantly, just try to think out of what you normally do. Acquire new ideas, like if you have to build something, browse online for some info... you can get info about millions of stuff online these days..<br>  <br>  And one more thing, (take this as a request) - You should try to work on your projects by yourself, rather than getting help from parents. This might sound weird, but it's important that you are able to do your work yourself and do everything without anyone's help. Im in 10th grade, and I have seen many of my friends who don't do their own work, and someday they will be left to do all the work alone and has no work and they do terrible.<br>  <br>  As the above person said, I wont suggest to draw, because not everyone is good artist.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Everyone cannot be good at everything.

dlqa6yFkaa	I've been a teacher for 15yrs and I prefer to keep it 'in school'. Once that student leaves my class or the school where I work that's the end of our association, I am happy for the student to come back to the school and visit or I just say Hi if I run into them but I feel I need to cut my ties once they are out of my care. 15yrs is a long time and I've seen a lot of kids come and go and keeping up a relationship with them is just too emotionally draining for me.

It makes a teacher feel good to know they have had such a positive impact on their students!|`|5I01tsgYaa	A teacher always enjoys hearing that she made a positive impact on a student.  Try not to do it too often, though.  Society still frowns on teachers becoming friends with former students, regardless of the circumstances.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	i'm sure they'll appreciate it|`|UzV0jc2haa	She'll love it|`|jVUEohsNaa	If she is the kind of person that teaching is her life.  Then you giving her things and attention will give her life some meaning.  If she HAS a life outside of school, then she doesn't need attention from you, and you are probably bothering her.|`|7L0AElC6aa	my moms teacher was hell'a happy when she had my mom 3 years after the first time she had my mom as a student.think of it this way. you know there tricks, if they miss-behave and that is one less kid to get to know.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I was always happy to receive gifts from my students, and although I no longer teacher, I still keep and cherish those gifts.|`|6jKJCuqgaa	well... u do give her a lot so she might be but most probably not|`|sVdCGwIUaa	She would totally love it! I think that she would feel special b/c she got gifts from students a year ago! How cool would that be?|`|j2VDYbeoaa	She will be happier if you can manage to use correct spelling and punctuation. Especially if she was your English teacher.|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	I would be happy that my  student still remembered me and thought about me that much! i would also think its really sweet!|`|GmbeNHNgaa	I'm sur she would love it! My daughter just gave her past two teachers Valentines and they where so happy!|`|JARRyCQVaa	My mom's a teacher and kids do that all the time.  Instead of being creeped out she is really happy.  If this teacher is actually as nice as you say, you should be fine giving her something.  It will make her feel good that you still care about her even after she's not your teacher anymore.  I definetly would choose that teacher because that is really nice :)|`|y8OCLEreaa	I think she would be honored.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Sorry to disagree with Babette but I don't think your grades are nearly good enough to get into BU. The Forbes site that she mentions is not at all reliable. You would be better off with the information on line at BU and at princetonreview.com or collegeboard.com or the US News data.<br>  <br>  Your grades are respectable and you will get into a decent college, but I think BU would definitely be a reach school for you.|`|bAqu8UlIaa	I think you have a pretty good chance of getting in.typically they look at your sophmore and junior year.but mostly junior year and you have a b average.with everything else and if you do well in your standardized tests then you definitely can get in.they will not hold your freshman year against you.
AA11604732	It looks like you have a shot at all of those schools.  It is hard to say more with the information you provide.  Good SAT scores will help you.<br>  <br>  I'm confused by your list.  Some of your "Match: schools (Syracuse, BU and Bucknell) are harder to get into than your "Reach" schools.  <br>  <br>  You can do better than your safety schools.  I would advise against St John's.  It really isn't a very good school, has the single ugliest campus that I have ever seen, and you can do MUCH better.  You can probably do better than UD, too.  If you are looking at Catholic Universities as safety schools -- consider those run by the Jesuits instead of those two.  In fact, Villanova and Notre Dame are the only Catholic universities that are not run by Jesuits that I would recommend to anyone.
AA10023710	You go to college first, and major in anything you want. You can major in a science, if that's what you like, but you can also major in music, or math, or English. It honestly does not matter, for med school admissions. Major in something you like, and can do well in. <br>  <br>  While you're at college, you'll have to do specific, med school pre-requisite classes in order to be able to apply to med school. Those classes include bio, chem, organic chem, physics, other sciences, math through stats (and sometimes through calc.), and college English. You'll also do health related volunteer work and physician shadowing. <br>  <br>  As you get close to graduating, you take the MCAT exam, which is the entrance exam for med school. You then begin applying to med schools. <br>  <br>  Your college should have a pre-med advisor on campus, who can help you pick classes and etc.|`|ziz0xURoaa	You major in a science field such as Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, etc. You could also also do Public Health as a minor down the road. <br>  <br>  Maintain a high GPA, do volunteer hours at hospitals and/or work at doctor's offices, and score well on your MCAT score.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	I don't know what country you are from, I can tell you about my education: 12 yrs, college included, general knowledge, then a tough examination to pass for Medical University( biology, chemistry and physics), 6 yrs. of Medical University as a MD, General practitioner, other 3 yrs. of internship as a GP, after that, for whatever specialty one wants, another examination and it depends on the chosen specialty, 3-5 yrs.working in that field, exams and so, you get to be a specialist. In total, 26 yrs. of studies, to become a specialist in a medical field. During this time, simultaneously, optional, you can work hard to get your PhD(4-5 yrs).<br>  <br>  There are some countries where is process is shorter.

lzEuuseJaa	If you're at the top of the waitlist, you have a good chance at being offered a place. Some kids are accepted to 2 or 3 of the very top schools and of course, will only attend one. Also, the economy may play into choices, some may choose a less expensive school.<br>  <br>  Did you ask the school how many waitlisted students are typically accepted? I would ask that if you didn't, but don't be pesty, be very polite and enthusiastic about their school. They may not want to tell you, but it wouldn't hurt to ask. With this economy, there may be more moving over the summer, so it is possible, if the school is typical, that they occasionally admit up to August from the waitlist.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

We normally think we never make mistake and whatever we do is always right and we consider that we are flawless. But we often find ourselves in several problems and chaos. We have very short vision over any issue. So at times we think we are very pure as gold and we are not. <br>  <br>  It applies to all. No one is exception.

qLkMSEBwaa	UMMMMMMMMMMMMM UNLIKE the 1st posters suggestions.....Even though I spank my son if and when he needed it,  and I believe taking out spanking in schools and teaching about God really is what caused kids to take over the schools, You CAN NOT take it upon yourself to spank these kids!!!!!!!!!!  You will have heck to pay with the parents who think their kids are always angels and end up without a job!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I did daycare for years..Private, professional, and  had my own business, also volunteered  in the schools when my son was small….I did 15-17 hour days between all my jobs.<br>  <br>  I know how to take care of these kind of kids.  I transformed who was honestly, what you would think the spawn of the devil is going to be in a kid.  Teachers had no control of this kid.  He called them all B*!ches and I got 1 teacher fired over what she did to him against another child.<br>  <br>  The boy was hell on wheels, but I got down to his level on a 1 on 1.  He was put in time out, refused and I sat him down and restrained him onto my lap until his timeout was over.  He kicked and hit me, cussed me out, and ended up cutting my lip.  <br>  <br>  I sat him down afterward..I said, Michael, You really hurt my feelings.  I said, you busted my lip, you called me bad names, you call everyone else bad names and you don't listen to ANY of the teachers.  I said, I am more than your teacher, I can be your friend, but you have to be my friend too and listen to me so we both have fun and are safe.  <br>  <br>  I kid you not, I no longer could walk in the room without this boy running up to love on me and grab my hand any time I had to leave for a couple minutes, and ask if he could go.  NONE of the other teachers gave this boy a chance to change..In fact, they hurt him worse by calling him names.  <br>  <br>  TAKE CONTROL of the situation that others have not and failed as a teacher and failed these kids.  Have everyone sit down or be punished to stay in a corner..while you do this.  Be consistent!!! Have them come up, 1 at a time, and explain that you are the teacher-NOT them, be sitting at their level-looking them in the face...Tell them, It is very important to them and yourself that they listen to you..  If there was an emergency, and they did not listen to you, they and you could be hurt in trying to get them to listen.  Let them know, you want to be their friend as well as their teacher.<br>  <br>  Give them a sense of worth and praise them for listening and if they don't keep your punishment consistent if they don't.  Let them know when the classroom is acting up, you will say, 1 2 3 and if they were NOT in their seat on FREEZE. they would be excluded in the next fun activity and sitting in the corner.  <br>  <br>  Now, people may laugh or not realize how great this works, but I had MORE CONTROL over my kids, than their OWN parents!!!!!!!!!!  Even if their parents were there, I still had more control.  I'll unblock my email before Monday,  PLEASE let me know next week how this goes.  It may take a week to get through to these kids, but believe me, It will!!!!!!!!!!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	try to use a cane or a wooden ruler to scare them! some children need to be taken strict! hit the cane or other object on your table or black/white board and then make a scary or angry or strict face on them. if they dont scare at all, try to put a hit on their palm (less hit energy but high angry expression). look them when u are scolding them and make them look at your angry face too. dont ever let them watch other places when u scold them or else they wont afraid of u anymore and start to "jump" on you head and disobey and disrespect for u.<br>  <br>  children love to be care and love. when they disobey u or dont listen to u, tell them "if dont listen to me, i wont love u cause i dont like disobeyed children, u know? u see? the rest of them listen to me. so i will put my love more on them and i wont love u if u keep on disobey me like that!" it may look like a long speech but it works on them.<br>  <br>  when they play other toys and dont play the one u gave and they didnt even ask your permission for the first time, then u must take ACTION! make an angry expression and say "did i tell u take other toys to play? no, right? then why did u take if u know that i didnt ask u to? u was trying to be disobey, wasnt u?" if they still ignore your words, then say "ok then, if u still dont want to say sorry or listen to me,u will keep on playing the toys u taken until midnight and i will call your parents/guadians to tell them to pick u up late!" then when they start to cry, then u try to say something nice like "there, there, there. dont cry. u must know that when u did something wrong or disrespect to teachers, it is bad, u know? if u regret now, it is fine! but dont ever do that again, ok?

As for specific instances..<br>  <br>  1. Tell them you are going to read a book and that they need to be good listeners.  Explain what a good listener looks like Eg. They cross their legs. They have their hands in their laps and they look at the person talking.  Practise this first and praise the children who are doing it well. If the child is still not doing it then say to the grade that you will need a helper to turn the page and you are looking for someone who is a good listener.  Not always but for the first time, choose the kid who is the more defiant one (but must be doing it) and later praise them for their great work turning pages. You want to be able to start saying good things to them not just DON'T and NO.<br>  <br>  2. Again focus on kids doing the right thing. Start every lesson by looking for children who are being good listeners (remember what a good listener looks like and make it clear that is what you are looking for). <br>  <br>  3. I would ask her to come and join us.  When she refuses say Eg 'Well when you are ready to join us again then you can.'  Then ignore her.  Tell the rest of the grade about the activity and be very animated with your voice. Make it sound like you are all having so much fun. Sometimes they start to make noises to get your attention but ignore them for a little while then say 'I have a special place for you when you are ready to join us again'.  Again ignore her if she refuses.  Don't ask her to join again after that but allow her to if she does and say something simple like 'Good to have you back' and smile. Don't give her the attention for her negative behaviour, only the good behaviour because that is what you want.  <br>  <br>  It will get very boring, very quickly sitting in that corner when no one is paying attention to you!<br>  <br>  4. Before you send them over to wash their hands have a talk to the class first.  'Our hands can get very dirty when we do fun activities at school.  Before we have our lunch we need to clean the dirt away. Until we clean them then we can't get our lunch'. Tell them that you are going to be on the look out for clean hands! Everyone with clean hands gets a Clean Hand High 5! <br>  <br>  If he still ignores the task then ignore him until everyone is done and is eating.  Say it one more time with a smile then again ignore.  He doesn't get his lunch and he doesn't get your attention until his hands are washed.<br>  <br>  5. Maybe use a sandtimer so that they can see how long they need to stay there and it might give them something to focus on while there.  If they touch it or are sillly in Time Out then start it again (but move the timer closer to you).  Explain this to all the children, don't just wait until something happens. And explain what happens if you don't go when you are asked Eg 'You will miss out on the activity'. If they refuse to go to Time Out then reasure them by saying 'You will come back and you will get to join in again but you need to go to time out first'. A quick praise for them when they join again and then just pretend it never happened.<br>  <br>  6. Again explain the rules of play centres BEFORE they go to them but say them in the positive. Ensure that the activities are not too long because little kids have shorter attention spans. If they move away do what you did and guide them back and remind them of play centre rules.  Also make sure that you are activily involved by moving around from group to group to make sure kids are involved and know what to do.  Focus on the children who struggle to stay on task.  If they say 'But I don't want to'.... Say to them 'This is the activity you are doing now.  Next time you can do something else but for now this is where you can play'. And always smile.<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember to stay positive.  I said this in my last response too.  Negative attention is still attention and if you give it to them then they will thrive on it.  Try to focus on the good things and if you can't then be creative and create situations where good things can happen.  <br>  <br>  It has taken me several years to get to this point.  Teaching is not easy and I didn't learn everything in one day.  It's a process trust me.  You sound dedicated and caring to be asking questions like this.  It's a great start!|`|DgGE6cijaa	The kids are pushing their limits to see how you will respond.  You need to be consistent.  At first you will need to be very positive and use lots and lots of positive reinforcement: "Let me see who's doing a good job on the rug.  I like how Maggie's sitting.  Oh and Mikey is doing a good job."  LOTS of positive reinforcement.  When the child finally does sit the way you ask, praise him and tell him that's what you like to see and that you're glad he made the right choice.  If a child continues to disregard your positive reinforcement, then say, "Mrs X needs you to sit on your bottom like all your friends."  If he doesn't, tell him he has a choice of either sitting on his bottom or taking a time out (or losing choice time, or not playijng the game, etc etc).  If he doesn't do what you want when you want, take him by the hand out of the circle area into time out.  Walk away.  If he runs out of time out, take him by the hand and put him back.  He will resist like heck but if you show him you won't back down, eventually he'll get the hint.  <br>  If the children keep telling you no, tell them it's not okay to tell the teacher no and that they need to have good listening ears.  If not they will lose some of their choice time.  <br>  For choice time, the chidlren should get to choose where they want to go.  I have a little board with pockets showing the different areas.  Each child has a popsicle stick with their name on it and one by one i have them choose their area.  They put their popsicle stick in the pocket of the area they want to go.  Each area holds 4 popsicle sticks ( I drew an outline of 4 popsicle sticks on each pocket so they would know how many 4 was).  Some of my kindergarteners still try to shove 5 pop sticks in.  <br>  The kids will get better when they know who's in charge but it will never be easy.  It's not an easy career.  I've been teaching for almost 10 years now (preschool and now kinder) and it's still difficult to control them somedays.  But it does get easier when you learn the tricks.  Positive reinforcement goes a looooooong way and the always want to please when most of the other children are.<br>  When you go back to work on Monday sing a song like "I'm looking for good boys and girls, let me see who is" and you'll see them respond very quick.  Sing lots and lots of songs even if you have no rhyme.  Songs are a great way to get their attention quickly.  Good luck and be patient!!!!|`|MEWiiUJxaa	IT depends on the type of Curriculum the School you are teaching at has. I work at a "Creative Curriculum" Center. The others are "Teacher Driven" and "Student Driven" [for example Montessori Schools] The reason they are acting like they are [or at least the way I see it, because I see children do this on a daily basis in some of the other rooms in the building I work at] Kids do NOT have fear, you will not win them over with simpling asking them or telling them. Kids are KIDS.. they need encouragement. <br>  <br>  At our school some of the teachers use the "Red Light" system, each day the kids will get a Red, Yellow or Green mark on their chart and the parents are aware of the system, and corporate to make it work well, NO child want a Red Light, because red lights make Mommy, Daddy and Teacher very sad. and Children don't want to make them sad. 50% of the children that do this... it works wonders.<br>  <br>  The other 40%-49% love the "treasure box" idea... if they do everything that they are told, then at the end of the day they get something from the "treasure box" [which can have, stickers, stamps, party favor toys, etc] in it, and the kids really love it, after the really hard headed children see their friends getting something, and they don't because you've had to ask them several times to do[or not to do] things that day. They will start to listen because they don't want to be left out<br>  <br>  That last 1%-5% will ALWAYS push your buttons, we have 4 in our building, that really just need that one on one attention and they wont get it from a school full of kids. But they ARE there, and you do have to deal with them. You have to get really creative and dig deep. After a week or so, you'll see what feeds into what they do and what they like, when you threaten what they want, their attitudes will change.<br>  <br>  Give it some time, hang in there, you will do fine. The first day is always a jump start to better things!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Y9X4wFLDaa	First of all, do you have an assistant? If so, this person needs to help with the children. <br>  <br>  Second of all, you have to get down on their level. You need sit face to face with them and let them know that you mean business but at the same time let them know that you are on their side. Children can tell when I person will let them get away with something. <br>  <br>  I had a child in one of the centers that I worked for that was the most unruly child you could ever meet. He would hit students, teachers, parents, he didn't even listen to his mother. My director decided to move him to my room because I was the only teacher he would behave for.<br>  <br>  I simply just told him how his behavior was wrong and how if he didn't stop he would always be in timeout. I asked him if that is what he wanted. He replied no. So I let him know that I could help him if he behaved and if he didn't I would be putting in timeout, everytime he did something wrong. We had an understanding. Eventually he didn't want to go to any other class. <br>  <br>  Another thing you have to give children some level of respect. They are just as human as you and I. If they want to try something by themselves give them the opportunity to do it. If they do it wrong show them the proper way and then let them try again. This is where everyone was going wrong with him. They thought because he was a problem child he did not know how to do things. But problem children are usuually the most intelligent. If you can get them to behave and show you they are made of. <br>  <br>  Teaching has got to be one of the most challenging jobs in the world. But you have to be patient and listen. Don't just say ok, mm mm, alright like you are listening and not giving them a fair response show them that you care.<br>  <br>  One more thing, whatever you are doing in circle needs to be more interesting or fun for the children. This seems to be when you are having a lot of you problems. Make it fun and more interactive for the children. You can try this for potty and handwashing time too. Find a song, make up a song that relates to handwashing and potty time. Sing this song and the children will know what time it is. <br>  <br>  I hope that I have helped some.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

agyeZK1Caa	B,D|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	It's like any other equation.<br>  <br>  3x + 4 > 10 (subtract 4 from both sides)<br>  3x > 6 (divide by 3 on both sides)<br>  x > 2<br>  <br>  So x is greater than 2.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah, sorry. If those are actually the answers, then b and d would be correct. Are you sure you copied them correctly because usually there is only one right answer?|`|TzhI283raa	Yes Mezmoco, but you must take it a step further. X > 2 so...<br>  <br>  X CANNOT equal 2 (it must be GREATER than 2), so A is wrong<br>  X CAN be 15 (it's greater than 2), so B is correct.<br>  X CANNOT equal 0<br>  X CAN equal 3.5<br>  <br>  so the answers are B and D|`|E5cflOpCaa	A,B and D|`|D0JsiC0Paa	Only B and D.<br>  <br>  If you replace x in the equation with either A or C, you end up with 10>10 and then a number bigger than 10, only those 2 satisfy the inequality so that the left is smaller than the right.<br>  <br>  If x = 2, <br>  <br>  then 3(2) + 4 > 10<br>  <br>  and 6 + 4 > 10, which means 10>10, which cannot be true because 10 = 10. This is not TRUE, so this value of x, being put into the equation does not make the result TRUE, it makes it false.<br>  <br>   Think of it this way, there is an equation to your happiness and this is 3x+4 > 10, so if you rated your happiness on a scale of 1-10, you would want to be very happy if you were more than 10. So say x stands for something that is missing in your life and if I were to give you just the right range of X you would be super happy. The idea is that if I give you something (x) or some numbe or amount of things (x) then your happiness will be more than 10 - it's the same with numbers if I give you say x = 2<br>  <br>  Then you put that into your equation and get 10, now at 10 you're happy but you're not the super happy that you want to be so it's useless, slightly more than that and anything more than that will make you ecstatic, so you won't settle for less than 2.1 or something more than 2.<br>  <br>  Replace the x value in the equation with the given x values to check.<br>  <br>  Or just solve the inequality for x<br>  <br>  It leaves you with x >2<br>  <br>  and so only the values greater than 2 in your choices are valid.<br>  <br>  Which numbers in your choices are greater than 2?<br>  <br>  15 and 3.5

T891gsHraa	During the scramble for Africa in 1880s the British took over present day Kenya and gave it the name British East Africa Protectorate in 1895, the name of the company that controlled stuff here then. In 1920 the East Africa Protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed Kenya, for its highest mountain.<br>  <br>  The British colonized Kenya until 1963 when Kenya gained internal self government and later on in the year, she got her independence from British colonial rule. This was after several uprisings throughout the colony by the natives whose fertile land had been taken and were forced to labour for their colonial masters. Notable among these was the MauMau uprising which led to the state of emergency in 1952. This was mainly a Kikuyu led uprising which left tens of thousands perhaps hundred of thousands Kikuyus dead.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	1890|`|AA11988604	On 1 July 1895 the British government proclaimed a protectorate of an area including what is now Kenya, and in 1902 made the Uganda territory part of the protectorate also. In 1902, the East Africa Syndicate received a grant of 500 square miles (1,300 km2) in order to promote white settlement in the Highlands. The capital was shifted from Mombasa to Nairobi in 1905, and on 23 July 1920 the protectorate became the Kenya Colony.|`|nNfnL8Alaa	there is no one date for the colonization of Kenya. the borders of Kenya were defined during the scramble of Africa.(Berlin Conference (1884 - 1885). even thought there were borders defined the British had to go tribe by tribe, community by community to "to colonize them".  As they subjugated the communities they were also setting up their colonial government and building infrastructure in other parts of the country. <br>  <br>  it  is hard to say when they exactly colonized Kenya as the events  overlap each other and there is no linear timeline to follow.|`|2nNfD4T1aa	wikipedia will help.<br>  <br>  i don't feel sorry enough for you to give the complete answer.|`|GmzxBW7Caa	1914

FmvnC8keaa	Well if you have to write a 5 day journal on some exciting stuff that happened to you then make about a paragraph or two about each day (if this is atleast the amount of information you need) Just re-think over what you have done in the past five days, and if you cannot think of anything then make something up. For example - 1. My friend (Insert friend's name here) and I were walking in the movie theatre (can change place if desired) and I found a $50 on the ground. I turned it into management. They made announcements that a sum of cash had been found but no one said the right amount, or that it was theirs. After the movie had ended, the manager gave me the money for being such a nice citizen and because the money had not been claimed. 2- My Brother and I were outside trying to make a treehouse/snowfort and a plank of wood/mound of snow/shovel fell on him. The impact was so hard that we had to take him to the emergency room. He ended up needed to get stiches but will be okay soon enough. 3- My dad and I were playing football (inside) and when I threw the football it hit my mother's favorite ceramic lamp that her grandma had given her. My mom was not home at the time, and she had told us not to play football inside but we thought that nothing would happen. I am now grounded for a month and have no phone privileges. 4- My mom was cooking french fries the other day and I decided to go and sneak a handfull to get more than my brother. The hot pan was still on and immensely hot. I burnt my had and had to put ice on it to try and keep it from burning. My mom was extremely scared at first and it hurt like no other. 5- We had let our cat (or dog) (name inserted here) outside to go to the bathroom. We heard some large cry for help, some sort of a cat scream, and went outside to see that (cat name here) had run off the have a fight with the neighbor cat. She ended up getting a few scratches, but she won the fight.|`|WRvwnBmIaa	Amazing stuff that recently happened?

variCa6Qaa	I can only imagine (that's a joke, sorry). Ok, after light is transmitted through the lens, the image is translated into signals that go directly to congnitive areas of the brain. That's where it gets tricky. When everything works properly, your brain interprets the information correctly and you "see" whatever is in front of you. It has to do with collective consciousness and what we all agree upon as reality. When it doesn't work, your vision is considered defective, even though your brain is doing its best to do the work.|`|BIFO1Vudaa	it goes through the retina, and then there's something about bar and cones....sorry pal, I don't want to get my biology notes out

That is the point of the AP and Honor classes. They are advance course that give you a taste of what college course will be like.  They also help give you a deeper understanding of the subject to help prepare you for your future career.<br>  <br>  Try to maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA. The higher your GPA, the greater your chances are at getting into the college of your choice.<br>  <br>  In terms of extracurricular activities, do two- three activities that has something to do with your intended major in college. This will give you an opportunity to learn about your potential career and to get great letter of recommendation from your supervisor. For example, if you are interest in medicine, volunteer at a hospital or something in that nature..<br>  <br>  In your personal statement, write about what you have learn about yourself and your future career through those volunteer experience.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!!! If you do these things, you will increase your chances at getting accepted into a top school in the nation.<br>  <br>  Dont forget to do well on your SAT I/SAT II/ ACT/ Aim for 500+ in each section of the SAT I exam. Aim for a score higher than a 25 on the ACT and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  ss

lQIKWXDuaa	Unfortunately, you will be very limited unless you have a green card or are a US citizen. The US banks tend to lend money only to people with those status. Your best option is to borrow money from banks within your country or from international banks. Also, you may be able to find scholarship that allows people with a visa to apply but those are rare.

Presence within the state of Missouri for a minimum of the twelve (12) immediate past, consecutive months coupled with proof of intent to make the state of Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period; or<br>     2. Presence within the state of Missouri for the primary purpose of retirement, full time employment, full time professional practice, or to conduct a business full time.<br>  <br>  (D) In determining whether a student holds an intent to make the state of Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period, the following factors, although not conclusive, shall be given heavy weight:<br>  <br>     1. continuous presence in the state of Missouri during those periods not enrolled as a student; presence within the state of Missouri upon marriage to a Missouri resident and the maintenance of a common domicile with the resident spouse;<br>     2. substantial reliance on sources within the state of Missouri for financial support;<br>     3. former domicile within the state and maintenance of significant connections while absent; and<br>     4. ownership of a home within the state of Missouri.<br>  <br>  The twelve (12)-month period of presence within the state, as stipulated in paragraph (8)(C)1. of this rule, in and of itself, does not establish resident status in the absence of the required proof of intent.<br>  <br>  (E) The following factors shall be given less weight than those in subsection (8)(D) and include:<br>  <br>     1. voting or registration for voting;<br>     2. part time employment; lease of living quarters;<br>     3. a statement of intention to establish a domicile in Missouri;<br>     4. automobile registration or operator's license obtained in Missouri; and<br>     5. payment of income, personal, and property taxes in Missouri.<br>  <br>  The factors listed in this subsection have applicability only as they support the intent to make the state of Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period.<br>  <br>  (F) Resident status is one criterion of eligibility for student-grant awards administered by the CBHE. There are additional criteria of eligibility and the establishment of resident status by a student does not guarantee that the student will be awarded a student grant.<br>  <br>  (G) The waiver of forgiveness of a nonresident student fee, in full or in part, shall have no bearing on the residency status of a student and shall not be a basis for classification of a nonresident student as a resident.<br>  <br>  (H) For those nonresidents who pay Missouri income tax, the nonresident student shall receive a credit against the nonresident student fee in an amount equal to the actual Missouri income tax paid for the previous calendar year except that the remaining fee obligation shall not be less than the amount of the resident student fee. Unemancipated minor students are eligible by reason of payment of Missouri income tax by the nonresident individual or individuals having legal custody of students.

OcfUTWataa	There is a difficult situation (puzzle) that needs to be understood. There are multiple facts linked to it, but some of the facts (pieces) don't make sense when you try to connect them with the situation. <br>  For example:  police find a murder victim, and look around the area for clues.  The body is on an urban sidewalk with only buildings and asphalt for miles around, but on the body are traces of clay from an area hundreds of miles away.  Is the clay related to the person's death? Is the clay related to the murderer?  This fact doesn't make sense -- it's a piece of the puzzle that doesn't fit.|`|3MAi3vJmaa	I'm guessing it means that you thought you were doing something right when actually you weren't, and that action you made should have come later.

KwuTnnNUaa	I don't know what state you're in.  In the Midwest there is a program through Northwestern University (a private university, by the way) called Midwest Talent Search, that offers above level testing for kids identified a number of ways, one being at least one standardized test score in ANY SUBJECT, 95 %ile or above, or parent identification with NO TEST SCORES needed.  Studies show that parents are usually the best identifiers of their child being gifted, as they know them the best!  This talent search goes through ninth grade.  They offer these kids above level  tests EXPLORE for 3rd thru 6th and ACT or SAT in 6th thru 9th.  If your child is in 3rd grade, they need to show a standardized test score of 97th%ile or above because they are so young.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I did this with our son in fourth grade.  He did well on the EXPLORE and armed with the score report, which is extensive and very helpful through the Midwest Talent Search, we convinced easily, the administration for help with his education in a variety of ways, from subject skipping at first while he was young and immature, to finally, an outright grade skip.  The Talent Search also offered him a place in a program through Western Michigan University (I believe other locales and states offer similar things) that were radically accelerated because he reached certain scores that they required to be in it on the SAT.  He took two years of their high school English in 7th and 8th grade, and was DONE with high school english requirements.  Math is the same way.  One semester of their course equals one year high school.  My son took their geometry (he was already in a program for math through our school system's program so we didn't do the whole program) and had his 10th grade geometry done by the middle of his 7th grade year.   If a child doesn't achieve the score for either of the accelerated programs, they offer advice for what your child does need, which will be more than the average child even if not accelerated--the child is still gifted and needs to be educated differently.<br>  <br>  Please do a web search for talent searches in whatever area you're in.  I'll give you the link for the Midwest Talent Search. Actually they've changed their name to Northwestern University's Midwest Academic Talent Search or NUMATS.<br>  <br>  Don't give up!!  I'll give you a link to an article by Stephanie Tolan which tells beautifully why you shouldn't!!  Good good luck!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Sounds like you're doing everything right.  Your daughter is lucky she has parents that see what she needs and are willing to provide her with it!   See if your school would be willing to advance her individually in certain classes when you get her scores and have them in hand.  I don't know what your relationship with the administration is, but maybe they will do this for your daughter.  This way they don't need a "gifted" program.  They already have the class there!    Again, good luck!|`|W1xs3vYBaa	Nope. In Canada IQ tests may be an indicator but they are not used to enter any gifted programs. It's on the recommendation of the teacher that their put in there, as well as an interview. Of course they also use the standardized tests as an indicator, but if someone is bright and hasn't mastered taking a test they are still moved to a gifted program<br>  <br>  Also, the child has to want to enter it.

I wake up every morning at seven and it takes me twenty minutes to pee."<br>  <br>  The 80 year old man says, "My case is worse.

But I'll try and think of some quotes.<br>  <br>  Quotes....<br>  - The more I know about men the more I like dogs.<br>  - Marrying a man is like buying something you've been admiring for a long time in a shop window. You may love it when you get it home, but it doesn't always go with everything in the house. <br>  - Behind every successful man there is a surprised woman. <br>  - If men can run the world, why can't they stop wearing neckties? How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a little noose around your neck? <br>  - I wanted to make it really special on Valentine's day, so I tied my boyfriend up. And for three solid hours I watched whatever I wanted on TV. <br>  - There is a vast difference between the savage and the civilized man, but it is never apparent to their wives until after breakfast. <br>  - Why did God create men? Because vibrators can't mow the lawn. <br>  - If you never want to see a man again, say, 'I love you, I want to marry you. I want to have children...' - they leave skid marks. <br>  - See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time. <br>  - Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours.<br>  <br>  Okay I am officially done now. I should have been done 30 jokes ago but....I ramble too much.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Q: How many men does it take to tile a bathroom?<br>  A: Just one, if you slice him really thin!|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Try telling that wonderful joke about a blonde I copy/paste from<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArMT3cf4LRkELnjR54thc9Dty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215043456AA9L0SM&show=7#profile-info-RKspmgFIaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Thanks to contributor Michelle M:<br>  An attractive blond from Dublin arrived at the casino and bet <br>  Twenty thousand dollars on a single roll of the dice.

They realize that they love each other, and because of them they are able to somehow live again from the love provided by their partner. I think this ties in exactly with the story of Romeo&Juliet.|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	"We'll stay forever this way"- Romeo and Juliet died together, and will be together for eternity.<br>  "Near, far, wherever you are"- Juliet still loves Romeo even when he is banished.<br>  "The heart does go on"- Romeo and Juliet will still love eachother forever|`|WOqyVFO3aa	well for starters...my heart will go on<--that's about the fact that even though he's banished to mantua or that their both dying in each others arms they will always love each other...every night in my dreams...i believe there's one scene where juliet sees romeo dying while hes leaving her she says:<br>  <br>  O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br>  Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,<br>  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:<br>  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.<br>  <br>  that just lengthens the meaning of my heart will go on...she can see him dying right in front of her and yet she never gives up on their love!!

Since Spanish is more prevalent where you live, it will make you more marketable as a nurse or a physician assistant to prospective employers. So many people are going into nursing and physician assistant right now, it will give you a edge over them. I plan on buying Rosetta Stone to teach myself Spanish. It is like a second language where I live as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!<br>  ss <br>  <br>  ss
5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	The answers are all inside of you.  And yes, a school counselor would definitely be a great occupation as a goal.  It is a job that has a great level of job satisfaction among teachers.  Because of that, it is also a job that is highly sought after.  Probably not a position that you might just walk in to.  You should have a plan A, B, and C.  A school counselor would need both education and psycology in their education.  A social worker, human relations, or employee relations might require a psycology and business education.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing by thinking it though.  There will be choices, and you may have to work your way into your career.  It is very wise to know your choices.|`|xc6iCPUQaa	You could be a school guidance counselor.|`|hFpbidA2aa	try being a psychologist that specializes in children.
1bc954558a35cac62ae741987c1dd12eaa	It is not inappropriate but would be kindda out of place. If you work in your field, then hanging it would mean more to show your credentials.  Why don't you have it displayed at home?  Maybe in an office-type place/area or in your library area?  Or in the living room if you don't have a home office.|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	You earned it, why not.|`|H8gsDRWeaa	Diplomas and other signs of achievement and accreditation are a professional's billboards. They work best when displayed appropriately.  Your MA diploma, though you are justly proud of it, doesn't belong in a setting that has nothing to do with the subject. <br>  Social interaction is based upon cues and the meanings that they convey.  The process by which we tailor our presentations of self to different audiences is fundamental to social interaction.  This impression management.will guide, channel, and direct the behavior of others in accordance with our own wishes and needs.  We employ spatial and physical items of scenery or props to stage our performance.  Framed diplomas convey a scientific mystique and competence in a doctor''s or clinician's office. Elsewhere they telegraph that the occupant of the space is demanding a social rank that elicits deference and social distance -- even though that may not be so. So framed diplomas in the wrong setting can backfire, telling visitors that the occupant may be overqualified, thinks too highly of himself/herself, and is a big frog in a small pond waiting for the right opportunity to make the move to a larger stage. <br>  There are cultures around the world where the display of an MA degree in one's office is appropriate, even though the MA may have nothing to do with the field at hand. But in the US culture, this may be perceived as giving oneself airs.|`|edd0e92c63ad711759edf3a8fce22938aa	If the field is totally unrelated, I would shy away from putting it in an easily noticeable place. You could put it in a more subtle corner of your office that isn't so "in your face" (like don't place it above your head or chair). Put your related degree in the more obvious location.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	check around your work place. if other people are hanging their diplomas, it's probably okay. as far as it being unrelated, most people will just notice that you have a diploma and not take the time to go up to it and read the fine print and find out you were a psych major.|`|LjyfQZdwaa	Congratulations!

It's not too bad and I say this as a student who HATES math! I survived lol. Just remember that this field not only has a lot to do with fashion, but business as well.

Especially if you continue to allow it to happen.  <br>  <br>  I really would not turn your partner in for her lack of participation, as you will also be judged for allowing her not to participate.  In this instance you are the manager, and you were not able to inspire those that you work with to get involved.  This is a lesson of teamwork, and also a lesson in leadership.  <br>  <br>  You will have an edge in your future if you can learn how to effectively get others to contribute and participate.  A chain, and a team, is only as strong as the weakest link.  If you can learn to motivate, you will have learned the most valuable lesson, and it will pay off in the future.<br>  <br>  If you inform your teacher that you couldn't get your partner to participate, you will get all the recognition for the work, but you will also be judged that you weren't able to work as a team.   You might get an A for your work, but an F in teamwork.  Become a leader, it will be worth the effort!|`|1c05cd87b278063482a9135943e3cdeeaa	Be careful you don`t want to make enemies if possible. In the 6th grade it isn`t really that important but if it bothers you that much try suggesting to the teacher that you should work either alone or with another student. This way your teacher will be able to see how good you are and will expose how lazy your friend is. If your teacher has got anything about him or her they will be able to see exactly how poor she is and how good you are

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	That depends on whether you want to be a clinical psychologist or a psychologist in a general psychology field.  If the former, then it takes anywhere from 5-8 years of post-graduate studies and internship to complete your program and qualify for a license.  This is on top of the regular 4 year undergrad you need to do.  So all together 10+ years.  Keep in mind doctoral clinical psychology programs are highly competitive so you should have a GPA 3.7+.<br>  <br>  To be a regular psychologist you need 4-5 years of doctoral studies and programs are less competitive.  However, you wont find a job very easily after you graduate unless you're looking into academics and even then it's probable you may never find steady work unless you graduated from a top school.|`|4ZRKd0Moaa	I am pursuing the same position...<br>  <br>  It takes about 4 years for a bachelor's degree, 2-4 for a Master's, and about another 4-6 for a Doctorate.<br>  <br>  The very least out of all this education, you would need to obtain a Master's in some states (to practice) and in others you would need a PhD. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. :D|`|kh4HWUIRaa	In the states you'll need to get a BA/BS, so that's 4 years.

AA10023710	What sort of opportunities do you think you've passed up by choosing UF over NYU? Are you sure? Because a free ride to UF, which is an excellent school, is not something to dismiss unless you are *sure*. <br>  <br>  You say you're doing "pretty well in college right now". What exactly do you mean by that? Because you're in college now, your college grades are going to mean a lot more to NYU, or to any other school, than your high school stats will at this point. In other words, they're going to admit you based on how you're doing now, not how you did in HS. <br>  <br>  Think through all this before you jump. I especially want you to think about what you think you're missing re: opportunities. Are you actually correct? Are the opportunities you're missing great enough to make up for the increase in tuition costs? Is there something that you can you do at UF to provide yourself with those same sorts of opportunities? Internships. Co-ops. Working with on-campus clubs. Getting involved with a professor's research. Join the honors program. Become a resident assistant. Volunteer for admissions. Take on a leadership role. Things you can do to make your resume jump off the page. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you shouldn't transfer. It's just that 1) UF is a really good school and 2) a full ride is a big big deal. I just want you to do more research, and think more on this before you decide.|`|VZ21gL81aa	Well, there is about to be 20 seats open that were previously occupied by the HERO protestors!|`|ZHvi5Kr0aa	I think you should be fine.

It may be worth it for graduate school, but NYU is known for giving out bad financial aid. I don't know your college GPA now, but I think it you have a good chance. I think they may not want you, because you already said no. Though, you are a good student and that's what they need. NYU is hard for a transfer student, but I think you should get in. If not, you may want to go their for your graduate studies. It won't look bad then, because it tells them that you wanted to save money and now your interested. Good Luck!|`|wZSvNggVaa	First of all, congratulations! I think you have everything set for NYU! <br>  <br>  Here's some advice:<br>  <br>  1. If you chose not to go to NYU because of the financial aid package, then you should not feel bad about this. You need to believe in yourself when you make a decision like this for better or worse. Now that your mind is clear and you feel that you made a mistake, then hurray to you because this means your maturing a lot.<br>  <br>  2. You have a HUGE chance of getting in! I would also encourage you to apply to Columbia and Cornell. I believe you may have a great chance of getting in!<br>  <br>  3. If you do get in to NYU, you should check it out before making a decision. NYU does not have a campus, and everyone there are pretty much high on themselves meaning that it may be hard to make new friends... If your a person who likes being around people and do not want to get depressed, then you should really look into this college and see if it's for you!<br>  <br>  This being said, I hope you do get into the college of your choice!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|Vi0S0xbuaa	STAY AT UF--NYU is like a bajillion dollars a year. I got in too and yea they do give out bad financial aid packages. You are only paying for the name--your better off doing great at UF and then go to NYU for a PH.D or doctorate.|`|kh4HWUIRaa	UF is a good school.  I would stay there and not accumulate any debt.  Especially with the economy like it is.<br>  <br>  A good way to approach transferring is like applying for grad school.  Look into the department you're interested in studying in and learn about what they are doing, read some of their publications, e-mail at least one of the profs, and build a relationship.  With the backing of a faculty member you're more likely to get in and if you don't you're better off from the experience because if you do want to go on to graduate study you have some research and contacts.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, but again if I were you I'd stay in the swamp.

Gq1rl0Ddaa	Okay... this seems familiar...<br>  <br>  Well then. Solar Panels harvest energy from the sun. Sometimes, panels are used to create electricity via photons from the Sun's rays. Other times, the panels are simply deflectors that are used to boil water in a tube where the sunlight is concentrated.<br>  <br>  Pro: The Sun won't run out of energy (hopefully) so this is renewable.<br>  Con: The Sun won't shine every day! When it rains, the system is unusable, or when its cloudy, and this process only works during the daytime.<br>  <br>  Wind Energy: Wind farms "harvest" the power of the wind by using the wind to blow on propellers that are attached to a generator to create energy.<br>  <br>  Pro: Wind energy won't hurt the environment. Its reusable.<br>  Con: Wind won't blow all the time, and you must have a good, strong, steady wind for this to work, or even be profitable. The wind is very random, and constructing "wind farms" takes up lots of space and time and resources, and usually can't produce much energy.<br>  <br>  Dams<br>  Hehe, fun word. Dams are used to block rivers and use the force of the water in order to turn turbines, like the wind energy.<br>  <br>  Pro: Dams are efficient sources of energy, and there are multiple rivers in the world where one could build such a dam. Also, dams generate decent quantities of electricity.<br>  Con: Everyone thinks that dams are clean. Well they're wrong. Dams create resovoirs behind them, blocking the natural flow of water, and pretty much creating a big fat lake. This may seem good, but too much water may make the soil over hydrated. If this is the case, then the plants around the resovoir die out, releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere; the very thing that we tried to avoid by building such a dam. Also, dams block the natural flow of water from the river. While they provide decent energy, the fish and various aquarius life are stuck. For example, you may have heard many examples of salmon blocked from their feeding ground and mating ground all because of a dam that blocked their way. This creates a major imbalance in our ecosystem.<br>  <br>  My knowledge is very limited, so try researching your topic.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D

mYhuGonfaa	"They" say teachers are in great demand, but when they say that they aren't necessarily speaking of your direct area. There are many teachers needed in urban and inner-city school districts, that opportunity is still there, but the pay is small. However, if you are a good teacher, can find good recommendations and can interview well, you can be competitive in the hunt to find a teaching job locally. There will always be schools cutting corners, merging, closing down, new schools opening, jobs being cut, jobs being added, and the list goes on. The truth is, there will always be children that need an education. Basic education teachers will always be in demand. Go for it because you have the passion, not because it's a wise choice. Good luck!|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Teachers will be always needed.  As long as you are going in to teach K through 5th, you should be fine.  The jobs that are being cut and merged are music, art, pe, and foreign language. The reason there will always be teacher jobs is that there is a population jump that is continuing.  Note, though it will always be easier to find a job in a problem school than a magnet school, meaning one known for discipline problems, etc.

fYLr7vM0aa	When he was a child it was ok for him to think like a child.  Children aren't mature so they are not expected to fully understand everything (in this case, God).  But when he became mature in his faith (when he became a believer or was baptized), he was able to realize the things God likes and dislikes and was able to please God.  He didn't continue to live by the standards he had as a non-believer and began growing closer to God by reading his word and praying.  Now, as people on this earth, we can't fully understand the things God has planned for us, or see the person He has created us to be, but one day we will stand face to face with our maker and know whether or not we fulfilled the things God had planned for us.  Right now, we can only see God through the little things He does in our life.  Through the love He shows us and the grace He so freely gives.  <br>  <br>  a website I like a lot is blueletterbible.org<br>  on the left hand side there is a link that says commentaries, and I like the commentator, David Guzik.<br>  hope that helps!|`|cqIyMj8taa	It means this:<br>  <br>  "Before I was a Christian, I was immaturely cruel, proud, and sinful.

xfqHi1tRaa	This essay has a lot of problems ... grammar, improper word usage spelling, etc. The biggest one is "person". In general, one should NOT write an essay in first person except in very special circumstances. You need to check with your teacher to see if he/she will allow it.<br>  <br>  I will go over one paragraph with you.<br>  <br>  I believe music should not be censored in any way, Artists and writers should be able to express themselves in any way that they want. <br>  <br>  OK -- the obvious is the first person here. Also, you do NOT capitalize after a comma and the sentence structure is awkward. Try this:<br>  <br>  Music should not be censored. Artists and writers should have the freedom to express themselves in their music and lyrics.<br>  <br>  <br>  In today's world,every artists is expressing their views, opinions and feelings in their songs about what they have been through and what they have to say. <br>  <br>  In this sentence, you have subject-verb and adjective-subject agreement problems. (And, musicians have ALWAYS expressed their view, not just in today's world.) Try this:<br>  <br>  Artists use their music to express their views and opinions as well as to tell about their experiences.<br>  <br>  I mean this is U.S right?, freedom of speech, the freedom to express yourself. <br>  <br>  Don't use a rhetorical question. AND this is only a sentence fragment.  Try this:<br>  <br>  In the United States, musicians should be protected under the constitution with freedom of speech and freedom of expression.<br>  <br>  It is not fair, that music should be censored in anyway. <br>  <br>  This is OK, but it should be "any way" -- two separate words.<br>  <br>  Alot of people think its only Rap that gets censored but, actually alot of other genres get censored like for example Rock. in some cases even the queen of pop herself Madonna gets censored.<br>  <br>  Run on sentence. "Alot" is two words, etc. Try this:<br>  <br>  While many people think rap is the only music that is censored, in actuality many other genres are also censored. Some of Madonna's songs are good examples.<br>  <br>  (Now give an example).<br>  <br>  OK, that will get you off to a good start. Keeping these things in mind (the same problems recur throughout the essay), rework it and post it again.<br>  <br>  One other thing to be careful of -- you MAY get "great job" or "you write great" feedback up here to get your points. I don't care if *I* get your points (I have enough of the useless things) -- however, this is NOT a great essay. It needs a LOT of work and I don't want you to be misled.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep working at it! You did the right thing by writing this yourself and asking for help rather than asking us to write it for you.|`|XE3PCLWNaa	You used "anyway" way too much in your first paragraph (try thesaurus.com) <br>  <br>  "I mean this is U.S right?, freedom of speech, the freedom to express yourself." -maybe you could reword this in a way that makes more since? -it's a good point though<br>  <br>  a lot is two words - second paragraph<br>  <br>   "i mean some countries take"  rid of "I mean" <br>  <br>  Miguel Estrella?? who is this give a title to him... a little more information would make this make more since..but not too much that it becomes off topic.<br>  <br>  "not retailer stores, nor parents" just use or because it'll sound better<br>  <br>  the last paragraph gets way off topic... maybe you could try to better connect it or get rid of the stuff about music being an "important" part of a teenager's life.<br>  <br>  You your point is clear it just needs some tweaking! Good Luck!|`|Az1L9qXwaa	I HAVE QUICKLY EDITED YOUR ESSAY<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Music should not be censored in any way since artists and writers should be able to express themselves in any way that they want. In today's world, artists express their views, opinions and feelings in their songs about previous life experiences and personal opinions.  Freedom of speech, is the freedom to express yourself according to the constitution. A lot of people think its only Rap that gets censored but actually a lot of other genres get censored like rock, for example . In some cases the queen of pop, Madonna has been censored.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A lot of large retailer stores sell Cd's that are not the Artist's original version, but many stores refuse to carry CD's with "parental advisory stickers". Some stores even go as far as not selling CD's featuring songs with profanities, explicit covers and/or lyrics. Some of the artists include Eminem, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Dr.Dre and the list goes on. A vast number of countries take this more seriously like in Argentina, Miguel Estrella was imprisoned and tortured by the Argentinian military due to her lyrics.<br>  <br>  There has always been someone, or some organization to stand against what another person believes.The only way to gain full freedom of speech is to never give up. Do not agree with the censorship of music. People are the ones responsible for what they listen too, not retail stores, or parents. Many parents do not judge their children for what they  listen to nor do they  say anything to oppose the artists opinions. People that do listen to music without critiquing it often grow up to appreciate other peoples opinions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, an Artist's music is an expression of their own personality, individuality, personal experiences and success. Censoring their music,changes what they have created. Many artists work hard to create music, and censoring their music can be quiet offensive. For a parent to decide whether their child is old enough to listen to a certain music album is censoring, they must listen to it themselves and decide whether it is suitable or not.<br>  <br>  Also music is an important part of a teenager's life. In high school  many students use music as a "way out" from their stress, and problems. For some, the lyrics from a song often reflect their lives like children living in a ghetto with parents who have drug problems. For others , who fortunately do not have any of those problems, simply use music  when they have had a bad day. Music censorship contradicts our first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of speech. Telling a music artist that they may not use certain words is the same as telling a certain newspaper that they cannot print a certain article with a personal opinions.|`|kt5plxKKaa	You have a lot of grammatical errors. i dont know if this is a persuasive essay or just explanatory. but in any case, the best essay looks at both sides of the argument. You are supporting that cencoring music is wrong. Follow this format and you should have a pretty good essay. Start your essay out with a broad statement like "Music has become an universal language." or a broad statement about censorship. Then give some background point. basically ease the reader into your point which is censorship is bad. you should also introduce why it is bad in the first paragraph but its not mandatory. Then the second to third paragraph should be about why censorsip is good. basically ur tellin ur reader all the points that contradicts ur claim and then u tell them all the things that support ur claim. The contradiction paragraphs could be one paragraph, two para, three para, depending on how much u wanna write about it but make sure u have more claims that support your thesis than that refute it. Also have a conclusion. in conclusion u dont add new arguments. u just support what u have already written. Re-emphazise them. Also i dont kno if this is jus a typo but u have a lot of commas in places u should have a period. make sure u correct that. Dont use any phrases like 'i mean'. <br>  <br>  Of couse im not gonna take ur essay and correct it for u and present u with the improved essay. but I'm in college and i have already finished all the English courses with A's. So just do as i told you to do and u should end up with an A.

AA11215438	Cytokinesis is the process where the cytoplasm of a single eukaryotic cell is divided to form two daughter cells. It usually initiates during the late stages of mitosis, and sometimes meiosis, splitting a binucleate cell in two, to ensure that chromosome number is maintained from one generation to the next. In animal cells, one notable exception to the normal process of cytokinesis is oogenesis (the creation of an ovum in the ovarian follicle of the ovary), where the ovum takes almost all the cytoplasm and organelles, leaving very little for the resulting polar bodies, which then die. In plant cells, a dividing structure known as the cell plate forms across the centre of the cytoplasm and a new cell wall forms between the two daughter cells.<br>  <br>  Cytokinesis is distinguished from the prokaryotic process of binary fission.|`|5T4r0Geiaa	process of cytoplasmic division|`|Cql8D5Miaa	a) division of the entire cell..<br>  <br>  more specifically the cytoplasm

Its perimeter is 2(l+w) = 20 units.<br>  <br>  Now consider another rectangle of equal area, except this rectangle has dimensions of 8 units long by 3 units wide.

It doesn't matter because you just want to know for the sake of knowledge.<br>  However, if you need to know because you are going to put a fence around the garden then a common unit is needed.
