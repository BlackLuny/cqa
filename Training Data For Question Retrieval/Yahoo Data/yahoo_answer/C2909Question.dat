20090203103809AAlB85I	Environment;Global Warming	Why do global warming deniers always feel the need to resort to lies, slander, and ad hominem attacks?	James Hansen is constantly the target of ad hominem attacks.  According to the denier 'top answerer',      "John Kerry gave a "gift" of $250,000.00 to Jim Hansen for his "work" on "Global Warming". The quid pro quo was that Hansen would support Kerry in the 2004 Presidential campaign"      Hansen received the Heinz Award in 2001. John Kerry has nothing to do with the Heinz Award except that his wife's maiden name is Heinz, and he didn't even run for president until 2004.    http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/ja...       Why do deniers always feel the need to engage in these kinds of slanerous, lying, ad hominem attacks?  According to Roy Spencer, ad hominem attacks are a key component of propaganda.  Does that have anything to do with it?    http://www.drroyspencer.com/2009/01/al-g...

20090219163749AAXcdIW	Environment;Green Living	What is a service sector or infrastructure that California lacks?	...or needs serious improvement?      How can we improve it to be more environmentally friendly, equitable, and at a low cost to the city/county or state? Or perhaps the innovation could actually generate revenue for the city/county/ state.      This is for my Sustainability Planning class, so I'm trying to gather ideas of making small-scale cities more "eco-friendly", equitable and sustainable.       Any ideas?
