Icicles on your balls kind of cold. So anyways we’re going around a slow corner and she (my wife) spots a baby skunk lying on the side of the road. Being the animal lover she is, I get yelled at to pull over and help the little guy.      “Fine, I’ll stop but you gotta get out and help it.” I say. So she jumps out of the car and picks up this baby skunk. Poor little guy is half frozen but still alive. She says, “What should I do?” “Bring it in the car” I tell her and we’ll “warm him up”.      So she gets in with the skunk and asks, “How should I keep him warm?” I tell her “Put it between your legs.” She replies “What about the smell?” So I say, “Just hold his nose!”      The doctors expect I’ll make a full recovery, but the skunk she used to beat me with died during the incident.

20090220040754AAXSspa	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you know any dark jokes?	Im writing a monologue and using the Joker character as my major inspiration (both from the Dark Knight and from the animated and comic series).    I'm thinking of starting the monologue as a stand up comedian (like how the Joker started out in some versions) but the jokes I'm telling are very, very dark and completely not conventionally funny, yet I find them hilarious. Like:    "Whats worse than nailing a baby to a wall???   Ripping it off!"    or   "Well...this guy goes into the hospital, okay?...His wife's just had a baby and he can't wait to see them both. So he meets the doctor and says, 'Oh, doc, I've been so worried. How are they?' And the doctor smiles and says, 'They're fine. Just fine. Your wife delivered a healthy baby boy and they're both in tip-top form.....You're one lucky guy' So the guy rushed into the maternity ward with his flowers. But its empty. His wife's bed's empty. 'Doc?' he says and he turns around and the doctor and the nurses wave their arms and scream in his face...   'APRIL FOOL! YOU'RE WIFE'S DEAD AND THE BABY'S A SPASTIC!' Get it?"   And just some dark, black comedy witty remarks.      Does anyone know any?      Thank you to anyone who answers :)

20090220041317AA256Yk	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why is Marijuana still not legal?	I mean when is the government finally gonna realize the law's against it are unnecessary. You'd literally have to be a moron to think that legal marijuana on our streets is worse than having a world filled with drug dealers growing weed for tax free profit. Not to mention wasting hundreds of millions of dollars trying to bring down these people and destroying this relatively harmless drug (do the unbiased research and you will see that it IS relatively harmless). Think about it, why is it not legal? It's current legal status is sullying honest, decent peoples reputations for using a drug that many say is less harmful than the world's most commonly used drug; Alcohol.

20090220042219AATSBr2	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What's your top 10 animated characters ever created?	What's your top 10 animated characters ever created?      Here are mine, please comment on mine when you answer this question.      My top 10:   10. Buzz Lightyear (Toy Story 1995)         Not so amusing but heroic, Buzz shows lots of heroics and makes         the Toy Story series really interesting.      9. Scooby Doo (Scooby Doo series, 1969)       Very funny, my favourite animated dog ever. Scooby sure is a classic       creation.      8. Peter Griffin (Family Guy, 1999)       To me, a semi-copy of Homer Simpson, but Peter Griffin still can say       his own stupid things and make people laugh. Best character of       Family Guy.      7. Horrid Henry (Horrid Henry TV series, 2004)       Newest charcter on my list, Henry has excellent adventures, but       sometimes disappoinying endings. But his tricks are really funny       sometimes, which makes him a really good character.      6. Shrek (Shrek, 2001)       Well, what can I say? Just looking at him makes me laugh. His       character and appearance was so hilariously created that if someone       even looks at him, they fall out of their chair with laughter.       5. Donkey (Shrek, 2001)       Donkey is, by far, the funniest animated animal (apart from humans)       ever created. He is just hilarious. He talks so much. Really annoying.       Very funny.      4. Sheriff Woody (Toy Story, 1995)       My favourite character in Toys Story. Sheriff Woody, again, is not that       funny, but very exciting. He is the main, and best, character of Toy       Story.       3. Bart Simpson (The Simpsons, 1989)       Best trouble maker on TV. Bart mixes mischif and comedy together,       which makes him a great character to watch.       2. Jackie Chan (Jackie Chan adventures, 2000)       Some of you might think this is a stupid choice, but I find Jackie       absoloutely amazing. He mixes action and comedy together (my two       favourite genres) and does quick and amusing fast action style       Kunf Fu, which makes him amazing to watch.       1. Homer Simpson (The Simpsons, 1989)       The funniest animated charcter ever by far. Homer Simpson is just       truly the best. No one can beat him. He is just the best.       So what's yours?    It can be from series or movies.    Plus what do you think of my list?   Please leave a comment when you put your top 10.   Please no rude answers.      Over to you.

20081106160122AA0trXR	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	What do you think about The young and the restless spoiler nick and sharon + Phyllis?	What do you think about this explain thanks. oshua Morrow and Sharon Case are on the cover of Soap Opera Digest.      Nick and Sharon run into each other in Paris. When Sharon tells Nick she has never been in Paris he takes her sight seeing(apparently Nick was in Paris previously) and soon things take a romantic turn as they start reminiscing about the past. They hold hands as they sight see and then Nick kisses Sharon. At first Sharon responds but then she pulls away. According to Sharon Case if Sharon thought she had a future with Nick she might be interested in pursuing a relationship but she does not want a fling. Sharon leaves behind a conflicted Nick who according to Joshua Morrow realizes what he once had with Sharon. According to JM Nick is conflicted. He is "crazy about" Phyllis but he can't quite let go of Sharon. What Nick doesn't know is that Phyllis saw the kiss. After finishing the photo shoot Phyllis (who was not able to reach Nick because his cell phone was not working) decides to take a walk around Paris and comes upon Nick and Sharon. After seeing the kiss Phyllis leaves and does not make Nick aware of her presence.      The next morning Nick goes to Sharon's hotel room to say good-bye to her and Noah. Jack calls and is not pleased when Nick answers the phone. Nick and Sharon then learn that Noah has been arrested. Noah and Eden were sight seeing on their own and get into a scuffle with some kids and were taken to the police station. Nick realizes that Noah was trying to protect Eden when he got into the fight with the other kids so he is not angry with Noah about being arrested. But he is furious with him as is Sharon for having lied and sneaking off with Eden. Nick decides to give up looking for his father and goes home with Sharon and Noah.      Phyllis beats Nick home and decides on a plan as to how to deal with what she saw in Paris. According to JM "she's going to play a game."

Otra víctima más es Britney, si se corto el pelo, si está gorda, acaso te importa?, ella tiene el derecho de hacer lo que quiere con su cuerpo, como tú por ejemplo vas al solarium o te pones implantes de silico.

If I get burritos one more time I’m going to jump off, too.” The blonde opened his lunch and said, “Bologna again.

The Mexican’s wife also weeps and says, “I could have given him tacos or enchiladas! I didn’t realize he hated burritos so much.” Everyone turned and stared at the blonde’s wife. “Hey, don’t look at me” she said. “He made his own lunch.”

I USED to find what he stated right, but NOT anymore =[  Anyway, here's the beautiful poem ..    Love's Philosophy  Percy Bysshe Shelley      The fountains mingle with the river,  And the rivers with the ocean;  The winds of heaven mix forever  With a sweet emotion;  Nothing in the world is single;  All things by a law divine  In another's being mingle--  Why not I with thine?    See, the mountains kiss high heaven,  And the waves clasp one another;  No sister flower could be forgiven  If it disdained its brother;  And the sunlight clasps the earth,  And the moonbeams kiss the sea;--  What are all these kissings worth,  If thou kiss not me?        '' Nothing in the world is single;  All things by a law divine  In another's being mingle--''     Thanks in advance.

A crusty old man walks into the local First Baptist Church and says to the secretary, “I would like to join this damn church.” The astonished woman replies, “I beg your pardon, sir. I must have misunderstood you. What did you say?”      “Listen up, damn it.

20090220052644AAwbVGO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Albums/songs where the pure beauty in them is the emotional pain and anguish that they portray?	Now I don't mean just a typical "I hate myself and want to die" song. I mean one where the pain being portrayed is real and sufficient, the artist is hurting and tells the world through the songs.      For me:   Station to Station - David Bowie.   He is deep in his personal battle with cocaine addiction that was to come out through "The Thin White Duke" persona. The detachment that he tries to place only seems to make it all that much powerful as a statement from the title track opening, to the odd choice of covering "Wild as the Wind"at the end.      Closer - Joy Division   Ian Curtis' collective suicide notes are really the best way to describe it all. When he yells out "Where have they been" in "Decades" you sense that the end is near for him.

20090220070637AASruXD	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Who else hates teenies? I do!!!?	I'm 13 years old, but I'm probably the most mature 13 year old when it comes to music. I listen to everything. Even classical and oldies. I never say that I like a band or artist unles I have heard at least seven or eight of their songs. Who else here hates it when you have these types of convos-      Me- Do you like All Time Low?   Them- Yeah! Their so hot!   Me- *Sighs* What's your favorite song by them?   Them- Umm..... Dear Maria!   Me- You're a joke. That's probably the only song you know by them...   Them- No I know Poppin' too!   Me- That's not even the real name! You only like them cuz you think that their hot and cuz you saw em on MTV, B*tch...   Them-......      I have been an ATL fan since their first EP(Three Words To Remember...) I didn't even know what they looked like until I saw em on MTV. I hated that they were on MTV, because that means that girls my age and even older are gonna start liking them cuz they're "hot." Wow... I'm rambling. Sorry, I just had to get all of that out. I really love the fact that ATL isn't played on the radio(at least where I live), cuz that just means that they'd be just like FOB someday. FOB used to make great music, until all of the teen girls started to like them cuz they're "hot." Then they sold out and turned from great fall out boy rock to horrible fall out boy pop crap. Scr3w Folie A Deux! I hate it! Tell me your thoughts. 10 points to the person that I can relate to the most.      Thanks for listening,   Hailey

Lets look at their lineup. According to Wikipedia, the band includes Seven, Mik L, Phat J, and Antz, and they do screaming/gangster rapping, autotune vocals, synths/backup vocals, and fog machine/light respectively. WHAT THE HELL!? No guitar or drums? They have a roadie listed as a band member, they're an emo band with gangster rapping? What the f*** is this?

'Okay then,' Scott said, and proceeded to drop his trousers, revealing the tiniest 'whoo-ha' the doctor had ever seen. It couldn't have been bigger than the size of a AAA battery.   Unable to control himself, the doctor started giggling, then fell laughing to the floor. Ten minutes later he was able to struggle to his feet and regain his composure. I'm so sorry,' said the doctor. 'I really am. I don't know what came over me. On my honor as a doctor and a gentleman, I promise it won't happen again. Now, what seems to be the problem?'   It's swollen,' Scott replied

20090219203730AAWgKoD	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	If liquor and cigarettes is legal then why isn't weed legal?	I have a question that I was always wondering.On tv they make it seem like smoking weed and cigarettes is bad.Im not sayin its not bad but its not worse than liquor and beer.For some odd reason liquor and beer get promoted on tv,billboards internet etc. encouraging people to drink it such as Corana Budweiser,Budlight etc.   I find that to be quite odd.Yet nobody complains about liquor being promoted.I really dont understand this.there's a lot of underage kids who drink alcohol and smoke but yet alcohol still gets promoted on tv and stuff.   I was just curious and wanted to know the answer to this question.   Why does weed and cigarettes get downplayed but liquor and beer doesnt?Why is liquor and weed getting promoted when its just as bad if not worse then weed and cigarettes      btw I dont smoke cigarettes.I actually hate them

20090220073817AA4jP70	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Chris Brown and Rihanna Chris Brown was right whats your counterpoint?	Let’s look at the facts... Celebrities don't just go hitting their girlfriends especially when their in the public eye. Something triggered him to flip out and lose his mind... there’s only one story that could cause him to do this and that makes sense is that Rihanna gave him herpes there’s even pictures of questionable cold sores on her mouth on multiple occasions. Im sorry but if a girl gives you a non curable disease (herpes) there’s no cure you have it for life... and she knew before getting with him she had it and did not tell him that’s unacceptable. If you give aids to someone like that its attempted murder and you will go to jail... well herpes doesn't go away either and she knew beforehand. Chris wouldn't have just beaten her... she messed with his life and his rep... He now has a non curable disease and a tarnished rep all because of Rihanna. I don't condone hitting girls but in the event a girl gives you a non curable lifelong STD and she knew the whole time... the girl deserves to have the **** beaten out of her completely. Honestly girls do you really think you can just give a guy an STD for life intentionally and expect not to get hit. Rihanna deserved to be hospitalized over that stunt... her pain will go away but Chris will have herpes his whole life because of her. There’s no other story that makes sense all the other stories are Rihannas publicist but yea Chris was cheating on her she called him out and he did that NO I don't think so BS the girl gave him herpes knowing what she was doing... and she got the crap beaten out of her... you shouldn't hit a girl yes Unless she gives you a noncurable disease knowingly... how can anyone argue against that. Giving someone aids (knowing you have it beforehand) is attempted murder... Rihanna pretty much did the same thing and isn't facing any charges she just got a well deserved beating for not being honest and giving an innocent person a lifelong disease.... you people who are on Rihannas side make me sick.

There is plenty of room to turn a simi truck around and for 8 years this company has deliver to me at least 6 times a year.   The last time the drive drove over a sidewalk near a barn he was delivering near. He broke the sidewalk. After saying they would fix it the company now says they were not responsible. Then then try to B.S. me about not being liable. They won't give me the name of the insurance company. They will not pay me for the damage. I asked for the name of the insurance Company and they said they are not covered for this. I said they are because they deliver to the San Diego zoo also and they have to have insurance.

I was just a little girl at the time I saw it I was about three years old. I would like to find the movie so I can purchase it for when I am a parent. If anyone knows what movie I am talking about I would really appreciate it.
20090220071251AAuomCe	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Recommend me some creepy dark metal?	Favortie Bands:   Cradle of Filth- love his voice the keyboard atmosphere, creepy themes   Slipknot- I like S/T and Iowa better than vol3 and AHIG but it's all good.   Korn-    Old Man's Child- Dark, the tunes are catchy, very melodic      I like dark heavy stuff, but it still has to catchy and not boring.. A lot of black and death metal I get recommended is boring to me, and has not melody. At the same time I don't like bands like Children of Bodom, it's too melodic for me. I like how creepy and strange all the bands I mentioned are. (except I guess Old Man's Child isn't really strange for it's genre)      Please refrain from answering with insult nonsense. Thanks in advance -Ryan

20090220080002AAaNpjQ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	In The Godfather 2, why did Frank Pentangeli recant his testimony against Michael Corleone?	He was about to testify against him in the Senate hearing, but then Michael shows up with his brother from Sicily, and he completely changes his statement. I have 2 theories:      1) He's afraid for the life of his family back in Sicily, because Michael has shown that he has access to them.      2) This I feel is more likely. His brother's appearance reminds him of the loyalty that he owes to Michael and the Corleone family, and he realized that Michael didn't order the hit on him. I feel like this is the more probable situation because the brother seems to have come willingly, and was looking at Frank with an expression like "How could you do this, how could you testify/rat out your family/friends".      Maybe I missed something...what do you think the reason is?

20090220061021AAv8pKk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	What is there to like/dislike about Bruckner?	Is Bruckner a giant, 'cornerstone pillar' in the world of classical music? Or is his music redundant, loud, long, boring and tedious?      Personally, I find his music to be a big boring at times, although he does have his moments of genius. 4th and the 9th are the best.      Anyone with any thoughts on Bruckner? Should he be considered top-25 ever?       I wonder if this will get as bad as the post on Brahms did.      Boy Wonder

20090220050056AAojjsW	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	It is true storygood or what?	Put Down LINE EVER           For those that don't know him, Major General Peter Cosgrove  is an 'Australian treasure!'           General Cosgrove was interviewed on the radio recently.           You'll love his reply to the lady who interviewed him concerning guns and children. Regardless of how you feel about gun laws you  gotta love this! This is one of the best comeback lines of all time. It is a portion of an ABC interview between a female broadcaster and General Cosgrove who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military headquarters.                                         FEMALE INTERVIEWER:           So, General Cosgrove, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?                          GENERAL COSGROVE:           We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery and shooting.                     FEMALE INTERVIEWER:           Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?                          GENERAL COSGROVE:           I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range.                          FEMALE INTERVIEWER:           Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?                          GENERAL COSGROVE:           I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.                     FEMALE INTERVIEWER:           But you're equipping them to become violent killers.                          GENERAL COSGROVE:           Well, Ma'am, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?                          The radio went silent and the interview ended.

I'm watching it right now, well I'm like a little more than halfway through.   Anyway I'm a Catholic, not like a crazy one :p I don't really go to Church or anything but I definitely believe. So yeah. & I guess you'd call me a pretty crappy Catholic because I drink and smoke sometimes and I'm a teenager and I don't think I'll be doing that no-sex-before-marriage thing. ANYWAY, the point is I believe. That's really all that matters.         So yeah I think the movie has some damn good points, and I don't see why it was rated R or anything, Bill Maher was pretty tolerant of everything and the movie definitely didn't make me an Atheist, it just pointed out some things that are true but honestly, Christianity is about faith right, so why the **** did everybody worry so much about this movie and the things it proved (I suppose)? Come on people....      yeah well I just wanted to rant a bit :P what were your thoughts on it???

Dreaming comes so easily   'Cause it's all that I've known   True love is a fairy tale   I'm damaged, so how would I know      I'm scared and I'm alone   I'm ashamed   And I need for you to know      I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say   And you can't take back what you've taken away   'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me      Healing comes so painfully   And it chills to the bone   Will anyone get close to me?   I'm damaged, as I'm sure you know      There's mending for my soul   An ending to this fear   Forgiveness for a woman who's now stronger   I was just a little girl, but I can't go back...             I can't go back...             I must go on....
