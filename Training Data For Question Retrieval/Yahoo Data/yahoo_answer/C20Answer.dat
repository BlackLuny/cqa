AA12155452	I perceive this as very much the thin edge of the wedge and the matter wouldn't really be of so much concern if we didn't have the global situation to reflect on.  It is no good being told to calm our alarmist fears when we see a global Revolution out there that seems to indicate rising and unstoppable tensions between the east and the west.  These people live amongst us, use our resources but keep the hatred simmering, inane though it may be.  Yes, I recognise that we are talking about radicals and fanatics here but exactly how many are there.  And how many Muslims can introduce themselves as 'Westerners' ?  I remember back in the 70s when I worked around the East End of London at night, seeing Asians on the streets maintaining what they thought at the time was a no go area. Personally I have no problems with the Muslim community as a whole and I come into contact with them on a regular basis.  My only complaint is when they insist on talking in their mother tongue at all times and I am therefore not privy to what they say.  I know of one Asian family who have been here 15 years but still wear traditional dress at home and the mother can speak barely any  English.  I cannot define that as acceptable Integration. I would like to see more integration and the Asian community not isolating themselves by default .... somehow I don't think that will happen.|`|61YfPllfaa	The British haven't got the balls to fight.....the Muslims have!.....so i guess Britain belongs to Islam.

Hell approaches, and the PC apologists refuse to acknowledge it. the British people wont face the problem. the fact is that there is only one party that will stop it. the rest will just carry on down the path to disaster. already! muslims are causing friction between Britain ans America.....the only reliable ally Britain has.

And majority of them are law abiding British citizens who work hard and contribute their share adequately, I am sick of people on these forums always complaining about muslims. I dont know about the film. Regarding Gaza, becuase many innocent civilians died so it is only natural that people conducted marches. As for schools , as one other post mentions there are catholic schools, jews schools so no point just complaining regarding muslims schoools.. Regarding mosques, firstly I dont know where you got your figures from but even if 4 mosques a month are getting planning permission, whats wrong with that? As long as a mosque is build according to the permission of local authority, whats wrong with that? I dont mind if Christians build churches.  I know little regarding sharia law courts but again if something is not against the British Law then what's wrong with that?    what you are missing is 'common sense'.|`|5580828d87e34f27c0a85291cf4a20c4aa	Yes without a doubt they are slowly but surely taking over. It appears that our government are to scared to say no to muslims and there schools and other establishments. We the public are not able to make any comment against the not so ethnic minorities of this country for fear of prosecution for being racist, yet they say things about white british/english people all the time and get away with it.    I say not so ethnic minority, as they are rapidly increasing in number and soon the white man will be the minority of this our own country.     I have no objection to the individual ethnic/muslim/pakistani or whatever, but the government are allowing them to come over here in their droves, to take our jobs, social housing etc.       The question i would like to ask you is this....would these muslims allow a christian church to be built in there countries?  It seems that these people have more and more rights in the uk etc, and we have less and less...where is the logic in that?|`|QQsIPlV2aa	I thought England was a Protestant country - religious wise!!

Why the hell don't they stay in the country of their origin!???  Can you imagine complete Ghettos all over England with nothing but Muslims living within it's walls!!!  They would need a passport to leave the confines and venture out into the "real" world!!!  Anyone born within these Ghettos would NOT be considered British Subjects.  The only problem is, England is such a small country, there ain't much room for the citizens to live as it is! One way to get rid of them!

To restore confidence, the Obama Administration needs to do three things relatively quickly:    1. Enact a serious economic stimulus bill with tax cuts.    2. Clean up the regulatory mess with the Banks and mortgage lenders that got us into this mess in the first place.    3. Create new jobs by sponsoring public works projects like new roads and bridges, etc.    If he can do all of these things, the economy will bottom out this year and will begin recovery by about the second quarter of next year (2010). That may seem like a long time; but you have to understand, it isn't easy to kickstart an economy as large as the United States. It takes time for stimulus to work.    Hope this helps.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	It should start to turn around in a year or two as long as the Federal government doesn't mess it up too much.

People can not spend more than they make like we did for the last ten years.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	It depends on what the Government does about it.  If they do nothing, it will recover on its own in about two years.  If they cut taxes, cut regulations and free up capital it will begin to recover in a matter of months.  If they succeed with this "Stimulus Package" well, no one can say how long it will take.  FDR, using a similar formula, prolonged the Depression for nearly a decade, but remember, it was ended by World War II.  If not for that, it is not clear if it would have ever recovered.    *

I am of the belief that the United Nations is a predecessor to the one world government that is prophesied in the Book of Revelations. Like I said above I believe the United Nations should keep its nose out of each member country's business and in a perfect world it should be disbanded. I am sure someone like Donald Trump or some other real estate magnate could turn the land the United Nations building currently sits on into something that would actually help the economy instead of the seat of international bureaucracy that it is presently.    How would you like it if for analogy sake you actually owned your locker and you governed what happens in your locker, and you only wanted pink notebooks in your locker and that someone on the opposite side of the building wanted only blue notebooks in their locker, and someone else only wanted orange notebooks in their locker, but then the principal of the school opened everyone lockers and ordered that everyone needs to have at least one balck notebook in their locker. How would you like that?    In the above analogy each individual locker in the school represents a member nation of the United Nations and the Principal represents the United Nations head Ban-Ki Moon...

However what they all do have in common is the collective greed to make money (expenses) for doing nothing.

Not only listen but respect their viewpoints.    Now a liberal is a bully, he will shout down any other opposing viewpoints, he mocks the things that made this country great, God, family and the military as examples. He thinks he is an intellectual, he thinks freedom is license to do anything he feels like at the time.    A conservative represents those who worship God and still believe that a father, mother and children are the strongest family unit that you can have, (when it all works it still is).  They don't believe in aborting a child, nor killing off old people in a hospital because they are an inconvenience to other people. They believe a strong defense is the best offense. They know we are all sinners and do wrong but things can work out in compromise talking out solutions.    Liberals really have changed in the last few decades.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Historically, it was the party of fre trade, tolerance, low govt budgets, and religious freedom...but in the last 100 yrs--it has become the party of labor unions--welfare programs and big govt control--higher taxation--limited int'l trade...bigger govt--less individual rights.    Conservatives--are the party of preserving assets- whether it be revenues--lower taxes, less govt spending---in favor of more state's rights for citizens than federal govt dictating to states...    Liberals in today's environment--preach tolerance and hard work--but really want the govt to GIVE them everything--and are intolerant of anyone disagreeing with them...    I know many people whose homes and automobiles were spray painted-keyed and property destroyed for having McCain/Palin bumpers tickers-or yard signs... that's what liberal means to me--    violent--intolerant--civil rights oppressors who would hurt--riot or disrupt one's rights to force their way of life on others--limiting free speech and movement!

308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	They will basically ask you questions about each other, but not stupid questions like "what's his favorit color", instead they will ask about where you guys met, how long did you know each other before you married, why did you marry him. But the main thing they will do is observe the two of you together to see how you interact with each other.     For instance, when I went for my interview, my husband and I were in the middle of a discussion in the waiting room and we kinda brought that in the interview and we laughed and poked fun at each other and got the officer involved in the conversation. So he didn't even ask us any questions, just asked for marriage certificate and some bills with our names on it and that was it. Took a total of 15 minutes and I was done....    Just make sure you are relaxed and answer everything truthfully. If you look or sound nervous, then they will ask you more questions.....

Ow3iwCJlaa	I think he is a great politician in many ways and knows how to play the game -     I think also In a bizarre liberal way he does understand that Liberal Policy sucks  So having some republicans around he can stomach will help him keep an idea or two coming that is outside his thinking, He also needs someone to throw under the bus when the time comes, so why not a few not his own first (like the old star treks you always knew who was going to die, and in the old movies if a black guy was in it you knew he is going to die first this is the same principle) Plus he can show to the ignorant that look I am willing to be fair and balanced I do want input from al sides, but let us not forget that apparently he probably cant find as many uncorrupt dems as he had hoped so a little game a chess is the second best      He has a plan and it is up to us to make a strategic move as well to pre-counter      Chess is the greatest game and Politics is a close second with almost perfect parallel|`|TFdKrkP2aa	He took care of the important jobs with Democrats then threw some crumbs on the floor for the Con's to scramble over.|`|ogzHWAz8aa	If Mr. Obama screws with this nation he won't have much of a face left after I'm through with him|`|4AxBMYpUaa	No, he appointed them because he knows that there are smart Dems.

AA10118655	Because the federal government have been stripping away the rights of the states for quite some time now.     As far as drugs go, the Supreme Court ruled in Gonzales v. Raich that federal law trumps state law because of the interstate traffic clause in the Constitution. This case dealt with medical marijuana in California, and they said that growing it yourself for personal medical use interfered with the instate trafficking of marijuana, even though trafficking of marijuana is illegal also.    Makes no sense to me, bu that is what they said.|`|AA11206283	uh...marijuana is legal in some states.    Perxcription drugs fall under federal safety guidelines.

yvPA8FSsaa	This whole cigarette tax is the biggest scam ever pulled on the American Public.  Do you realize that less Federal, State and Local taxes, a pack of cigarettes would cost about 35 cents?      Look, if cigarettes are the evil, destructive problem they are being made out to be, why are they simply not outlawed entirely?  While I am sure they are damaging to ones health and annoying to non-smokers, I also know a lot of hype always hits the public airwaves just before another tax hike on them.    Just this morning I heard a "public service" ad bashing cigarettes again. This time claiming that school children loose 7 million days of school per year due to illness caused by second hand smoke.  Oh, really?  And how exactly would anyone ever be able to gather such statistics?  They don't.  They just make up a number as they see fit.    If cigarettes are that dangerous, ban them!  Stop stealing consumers money.      *|`|d9JUDZd4aa	Yes taxes on cigarettes disproportionately effects the poor.  Not a very smart idea unless he's trying to force people to live healthier lives, which isn't too bad an idea.|`|3nqyxHrgaa	for this bill we need another 20 million smokers to pay for it.  it's dumb|`|7OQWOaGmaa	This federal tax on cigarettes is a joke!

I am fed up with paying for any and all problems that this government has created for We the People.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	Lets put it this way, here in Norway (I am American mind you) cigarettes are about 16 dollars a pack.  Everyone smokes, and heavily.  They tax everything in hopes to 'make norway healthy' but all it does it make norway pissed off. Everyones like a teenager. Try and stop us and we just want to do it more...62 cents is nothing in the eyes of a smoker.|`|ZXr8BSRyaa	Since I do not smoke, let it be 62 bucks.  The mafia will just do that much more business in tobacco.|`|XbsDGhmNaa	I really don't think 62 cents is going to stop many from smoking. And Obama himself is a half pack a day smoker. Minnesota taxed the heck out of cigarettes already and people still smoke here, including my husband.|`|6yQqtbiIaa	It won't even out. For some reason, libs hate tobacco.

AA11622716	In the united states it is not customary for one with a JD to refer to himself as "doctor" but no law prohibits it.  In fact, even without any degree of any sort, you are free to call yourself "doctor."  While fraud is unlawful, that was not your question.|`|cEa8TTenaa	A person with a PhD or an LLD can call themselves and be called Doctor (not a doctor). It's a title not an occupation.    So John Smith, who just earned his PhD, is known as Dr John Smith, or John Smith PhD. When he is introduced, people say 'This is Doctor Smith,' and he can put his title on his business cards.    But no one will say my brother John is a doctor, because that's completely different.    I hope this helps.

Being against protectionism, a failed idea that has been shown through history to create worsening economic circumstances, is far from being against buying locally produced stuff.

qb9V9syNaa	The Coast Guard is a "SEA GOING SERVICE".  I was a Coastie for 8 years.  I did meet folks who never stepped foot on a ship, they were in the aviation side of the service. If you join the CG for a 20 year career, regardless of job expect to be at sea at least once.  Like I said there are a few who've never been.  But more than likey in 20 you will.  Now as for being stationed on a base right after boot camp.  I say you chances are good.  The CG has many ships and just as many bases/stations areound the country.  Back when I went to basic it you reveiced points based on all sorts of tests.  They gave us a huge list of all the billets that needed to be filled.  The recruit with the best score selected first and so on.  So the better you do the better the unit (relatively).     I loved every minute of my time in the CG.  Of the five military services I think of the USCG as the best kept secret.    read about my 15 minutes of fame in the CG....  http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3...|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	Cutter life is a pretty cool routine - you go on watch and work for four to six hours - get off watch and take care of the regular day-work - eat a meal or two and get some sleep - then go on watch again for four to six hours - then get a meal and some sleep... End day one - start day two.    The only time this routine is changed is when special things happen, like drills (practicing for when someone is overboard, etc.), or flight operations, or a boarding, or getting underway or morring, or transiting through restricted waters...    If you REALLY want to be a "sand-peep" and be stationed on a base or Station, odds are that you'll probably be able to do that - depending upon where your class ranking is in Boot Camp.  The top graduate gets their pick of first units... second in class gets the next pick - and last in class gets whatever is left over... so it behooves you to do well and be one of the folks that get to pick first.    My recommendation is to get stationed on a cutter - and on a cutter that is as far away from your hometown as possible.  Did you join the Coast Guard to see some of the world, or did you join to go home??    Regarding joining - we are doing very well with people wanting to join - and our standards have just been raised well above all of the other services - you need at least a 46 on the ASVAB to enlist.  Also, we're doing so well that many of our recruiting offices have already met their recruiting goals for 2009 and aren't accepting any new applicants until after October 1st!!  Your first goal should be to do as well as possible on the ASVAB.  The higher your score, the more willing we will be to work with you.  If your local recruiter doesn't seem like they want to talk to you, ask if they've met their mission, and if yes, ask them where the nearest recruiting office is located that is still accepting applicants.  Yes, you may have to travel several hundred miles to talk to a recruiter.  I know of a guy in Jacksonville, Florida that is enlisting through the Montgomery, Alabama office - because all of Florida and Georgia is full up for the year... and he got over a 95 on the ASVAB.    Good luck!

fUdBPu01aa	Excellent point! New Orleans is the ONLY major city in the US that sits below sea level. When you have a massive lake on one side and the gulf on the other, it poses a disaster for the city.    There have been countless other hurricanes that have hit urban coastal areas -- Hurricane Andrew in the 1990s devastated most of SE Florida, but that area was better organized. The hurricane that devastated Galveston Texas in 1900 killed about 8000 of the city's 22,000 residents, yet the city rebounded without any FEMA help.    Democrat mayor Nagin and then-governor Blanco, not Bush or FEMA, are to blame. The federal government is not a first responder to natural disasters. Read the article in City Journal.com about how Nagin sent a empty passenger train out of New Orleans that could have taken nearly 1000 people to safety. Yet, idiots on this board blindly parrot what the morons at MSDNC tell them.     Blaming Bush for hurricane Katrina is like blaming the British Prime Minster for the ice storm in Kentucky: it is stupid.|`|AA11360816	This is a really great point.

That said, if I lived in bowl several feet below sea level and a hurricane was heading my way I would have made a move toward getting the hell out of Dodge, for sure.  Truth be told, the State of Louisiana let it's people down, not the Federal Government, but the people of New Orleans, for all their hissy fit throwing saw fit to reelect Nagin as Mayor of New Orleans....go figure.  It's heartening to see that many have figured out how to mobilize themselves.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Yes, this does make me wonder about the mentality of people|`|dCewrtXaaa	No, it isn't a "great question" and you are not confused but simply racist. In the first place, many of the two million already lived in DC. In the second place, the temperature was not sub-zero. Third, the ones who did get into DC didn't all arrive on the same day. Fourth, the ones who traveled there could afford to. Not all the Katrina victims could afford to leave. And fifth, are you trying to imply that they deserved what happened to them? Your hard-heartedness is appalling. And "some of my very best friends are black" has long since ceased to be a funny joke. Some people think that no one will call them on it if they repeat stale jokes about other people's misery. Eventually karma will probably come back to bite you.|`|399be115381734eda49e566fc563731aaa	This joke is all over the internet right now and it speaks for itself.

BTW, do you realize how many Category 5 warnings N.O. gets during hurricane season? Most of them never get to that status.

Also, you failed to mention how the National Guard held people at gunpoint on bridges in 90+ degree temps with NO FOOD OR WATER.|`|9FI7zaKraa	hahahaha, answer: there was no anticipation of a government handout during Katrina.|`|reeU4N0eaa	The lure of plasma TVs to loot was greater in New Orleans than in DC.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	RK worded it perfectly for you; I hope you've learned your lesson|`|YZdTBWoCaa	You lack skills to support intelligent life.

Due to the bad economy, I have not seen a raise in two years.    I have not taken a significant vacation in two years.  I decided to forgo buying a new Jeep last October (the old one is just fine).  I did not upgrade my computer.  I put off re-doing my swimming pool, and painting my house.  I now shop the swap meet, and e-bay for things I used to buy in stores.  I no longer buy steak.

VuaOKpYXaa	Have you turned on a television or read a newspaper in the last 8 years?|`|0sEspN5baa	Take a look at the past 10 presidents.  The critics have always been there....  But now the public is getting more  vociferous.  And maybe that's a   good (?) thing in one sense.....    It would be nice if folks would   wait a bit before getting all  judgmental. There are 'things'  that candidates are NOT privy  to until after taking office,  which can change a person's  perspective completely.    Until United States Voters wake  up and realize that anyone sitting  in the Oval Office holding the  title of President [which translates  to TARGET ] has VERY LITTLE  TO DO WITH RUNNING THE  COUNTRY, there will be only  a country run at the effect of emotional  whims of the voters. It's been  going on for so long that it seems  as though USA should have  caught on by now.    Each successive president is either condemned  or receives accolades when first in office  SOLELY because of the previous work that  was in action before the new president  began term of office.    This turn of the public's emotional mind is  as predictable as catching more flies with  honey than vinegar.    It's NOT Obama's fault that USA is in such  an economic catastrophe, that's ball's been  rolling a looooong time.    Further, Obama never painted a rosy picture  of the state of USA. Instead what was told to  the people was, and this was repeated in the  inauguration speech, there IS a SERIOUS  situation in the country that Obama is willing  to help dig out from, but it will take a looooong  time, and may extend beyond his term of office.    Go replay the inauguration speech, listen closely.    People get high on emotions. The people wanted  a 'savior' and now are disappointed? What happens  next? Crucifixion????? People high on emotions  (whether the positive or negative ones) rarely  hear clearly, rather they hear what their emotions  want them to hear.    Wake up - grow up - quit blaming one person or  thinking one person can ride in on a magnificent  steed and 'poof' the country is 'back on it's feet'.    Face it - this is a very luxurious depression USA  is in - looks ok on the outside but underneath the  carpet the country is in more dire straits than during  the Stock Market Crash that occurred back in the  first quarter of the 20th century.    '9-11' did what it was intended to do, put terror first  in the hearts of all, and from there it's an easy step,  to demoralization, and further to economic depression  of a proportion not seen yet.....nor completely understood  by the voting public.    Take the blinders off and give this President a break,  he's not a sports star golf pro hero....just a fellow with  good intentions and a belief in principles and the pulling  together of citizens in a country.......and that in itself is  huge....watch and see if whomever follows this man in  the Oval office doesn't get either the praise from Obama's  work, or, which I doubt, the cursing from the remnants of  the predecessor's regime (which USA is now experiencing).    This is NOT meant to be pro or con the current incumbent.    It IS a bit of frustration at USA's extremeism of the public  opinion. Either kill 'em or crown 'em, and neither is correct....    The country started out worshipping Clinton, then hating him,  worshipping Bushes, then hating, now it's worship Obama and  hate him.....    Observe the pattern in yourselves and correct that and then  the result will TRICKLE UP to the oval office......    'nuff said for now.    thanks for this great Q, Semp, as ever :)|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Right here, for one, I criticized Bush often on his policy proposals even though I voted for him.

01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	I think we've listened to republicans the last 8 years, and look where it's gotten us.         I'm more liberal these days simply because there are no true conservatives anymore, but I do listen to O'Reilly and Hannity.          I think republicans listen to the left, but go ahead and do whatever they want anyway.         suddenly, because Obama's in office, the republicans are now fiscally conservative, but they ignored the lost 750 billion that Bush can't account for...with the CEO's taking 18.5 billion for bonuses right from the taxpayer.         Now republicans scream about how terrible the Obama stimulus is, when the last administration spent more money than all other presidents combined, and that was fine for the right.         It is most definetly the "right" that refuses to listen, or conpromise.         they go after Clinton for lying about a BJ, something any man in that position would do, but ignore all the abuses of power by Bush?         This is not listening, it's arrogance, and all the arrogance has come from the right...look at Karl Rove refusing to testify and ignoring the Congressional subpeonas?         No republican can explain why I have a lot of thumbs down, because they can't argue with anything I posted.         Why?  Because it's the truth.|`|fAPnuzg3aa	When it comes to politics in Washington, it is a pointless debate. Both sides have forsaken their roots. Both have sold out to their own selfish ambition and the career that has been made out of politics.     If you want to change it, look for candidates of any party that want the following changes:    1. Term limits for all legislative positions.  2. Allow voters to determine pay increases, not themselves.  3. Discontinue their special health care plan only they can receive.  4. Discontinue the extravagant pensions they receive for working only a few years.    These politicians do not work for us anymore, it is very obvious. These positions of American government were only meant as a service to the country, not a career. These changes would alter the type of incentives for those seeking election and therefore the quality of those that run.|`|93ef3d401a54c624311fba3ba86648bdaa	Neither side does, and we all know it.  The problem is, that no one will admit it.  When they set up a bi-partisan panel for something, the votes always comes along party lines.    My family has voted Democrat through every single election, in fact they  have NEVER voted republican ever in their lives.  Some of the people they voted for have been absolute snakes.  When they found out I was independent, you should have heard the names they called me behind my back.    There is no such thing as someone who listens to the other side.|`|DBIKou8faa	I listen to the other side and on many points I am in agreement with them.  I find that Democrats are a bit hard headed and stuck in their ways.  My father in law is Democrat and whenever there's a family get together the rule is to not even approach the subject of politics with him because he gets very angry and it puts a damper on things.  Funny really, because many times he brings it up and everyone scatters, saying "I'm not going there".    Additional Comment:  Stan sounds like my father in law, word for word.

I listened to Obama and I listened and I've seen him in action and the results of his ideas and what they have manifest thus far. I now say enough is enough. I've heard and seen all that I want to. He will destroy the country if he is allowed to continue with his half wit ideas and policies.

They have nothing to work with in the first place.    Think about it,    I want the freedom to earn all I can and I am willing to work for,   I want the freedoms promised in the constitution, such as gun ownership, and freedom of religion, speech and press  I would like for every working person to be able to keep more of their income  I would like for every able body out there to work and pay as much as possible for their own way.  This does not mean remove the safety net, just don't build a home in it.  We have real enemies who will not stop until we are submissive to Islam or dead.  That's a simple fact  I think a monster who rapes a child or anyone else for that matter should be put where they will never have the chance to do it again.  A crime is a crime, no matter what the motive is.  Someone killing a white man, is just as guilty as someone killing a black man, but we are pushing for two sets of standereds what's up with that?  A child in the womb, is a child, why should he/she get the death penalty for being conceived, while a child rapist gets free healthcare, free room and board, a free education, tv, ac, exercise room and entertainment at the family who he invaded expense?|`|JmdnlQsHaa	its funny, dems and reps are 2 sides of the same coin.  and the FED owns all the coins|`|84cab3e19692da71ddb2837fa88afa2baa	I think both sides tend to ignore the other, but if I had to choose I'd say Republicans tend to listen to Democrats more than Democrats to Republicans.  I'm not picking sides, as I'm neutral at the moment, but from experience with family and friends it's always the Democrats that don't want to hear anything negative about their side, whereas the Republicans, while disliking it, will accept it.  My sister for instance sent me an email telling me that I was not allowed to send her ANY negative stuff about Obama, only positive stuff, but I was allowed to send all the negative stuff about McCain I wanted.  My other sister, while not specifically wanting negative stuff about McCain, didn't tell me off for sending it.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Die hard partisans are a lost cause, no matter what political stripe. This is because they have closed their minds to other possibilities and believe only their view is correct. Everyone is not a die hard partisan though. Many people do consider all positions before forming opinions. Often times I answer questions knowing that the person asking has their opinion set in the first group, but it is not necessarily that person I am trying to reach. I post for the second group. Understand though that my goal is never to change the mind of anyone. It is rather to present an opposing viewpoint in the hopes that people be inspired to learn more about a given situation. Too much information is never a bad thing and it does not hurt you to be exposed to a variety of attitudes on any subject. Unfortunately the diatribe on Yahoo Answers often degenerates into nothing more than insults and name calling which is counter-productive to cause as a whole. Ultimately I use Yahoo Answers as an outlet and find it cathartic. If I inspire someone to think for themselves that is just an added bonus.

Obama was elected.  I disagree with him, but he was elected.  I have the right to fight every move that I disagree with.  I will do this with my vote, my voice, my income.    Somethings I am sure he will do right, but many others, like his first act of funding abortions in Africa with US tax dollars are just sick.|`|2CxfFENRaa	I was a Democrat until recently.  I wasn't that upset when Bush won because Kerry was a tool.  I was mad about the first election.  I'm a big person and willing to admit when I was wrong.  I WAS WRONG !!!  Bush was a better Pres than Kerry and Gore.  I was irate when Obama won, because he is such a bad candidate that he turned me Republican.(he opened my eyes)    Having been both Rep and Dem, Obama's win DEFINITELY  pis*** me off the most !!!!!|`|PtHThRoNaa	Yes. However I cannot understand how they feel since Obama in not even a month into his first term.|`|1KHVwyvoaa	Bush completely screwed up the country in his first Term. We gave him a chance when he decided to go after Bin Laden in the War, but he even screwed that up by taking the war to Iran. Rep keep saying the war was a success and Bush said, "Mission Accomplished", yet Bid Laden has yet to be caught. lol!! What a joke the Bush administration were. Dems will always hate Bush and his lousy attempt to run the country. Other countries even hated him, so it wasn't just Democrats. People even threw shoes at Bush. LOL!! That's really sad.
7wpJH4mXaa	After 8 years of Bush we can only go UP!    I am proud to be an American again, Bush can no longer embarrass our nation!    All the Republican rednecks can give me a thumbs down all they want, they just dont like the truth.|`|fAPnuzg3aa	Of my friends that voted for Obama, I haven't seen one of them that are very proud at the moment and it is only going to get worse. Where are all the hope and change believers? I HOPE they haven't been paying attention, because they will be so sad to see there has been no CHANGE.     For those that feel they can now be proud to be an American, need a refresher course in history and American Government. I am not a huge Bush supporter by any stretch of the imagination, but Obama is not going to solidify our American way of life or the things that made us so great. He was a false promise that will not be able to deliver.     I didn't want McCain either, but he was a lesser of two evils. Wouldn't it be nice to have a business savy president like Romney in these economically unstable times? Or how about a president that knows that real solutions do not come from government but rather from the citizens and private sectors. And one that knows large goverments are oppresive in their very nature. That canidate was Ron Paul, who everyone thought was crazy. He will continue to look like a genius as this debacle unfolds. He saw this financial crisis coming long before most everyone else. America needs to inform themselves before the primaries or we are going too continue to get the same crappy choices every election.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Barely a month into his presidency, I would say 2.  Fox is a joke.|`|1KHVwyvoaa	It's funny how Replublicans on here are bitching ahd whining about Obama and his choices, yet Bush made literally thousands of terrible choices that got the country where it is today. Are you not working right now? Blame you  $%^& president Bush for that. American is in a trillion dollar deficit. Why? Ask Bush. War, compusive spending on stupid things, poor trading, etc... So you can complain all you want abouot Obama. He's already doing more good things for the U.S. then Bush did in his 8 yrs in office. Most of the things Americans are complaining about was caused by Bush to begin with. Obama hasn't even been in office for a month yet and people are already complaining. Give it a rest.|`|sa6J59elaa	It seems that he has a bill everyday and is trying to rush it into Congress and get it approved.  I can't comprehend that.

He is making a mess of the stimulus package by allowing Pelosi and company to write the stimulus bailout package. He said no PORK and that is about all it is. He even ask the Democrats to cut out some of the pork to try and get Republicans to support it.   His 10% cut across the board of the Military and the closing of Gitmo could result in a mess.  But he has good ideas for change that nobody supports. His supporters are having trouble in their support for the billions of bailout dollars he is proposing and what they are designed to be used for.  Yes. If he is not careful, a 'mess' would fail to describe his Administration and their policy|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Said no Lobbyist--Got one..  Said no Pork....added 500 million in Pork..

I remain hopeful that he'll still be better than bush though|`|G9VOOzS9aa	As a FORMER Democrat, I see more to worry me every day, like this treaty the Gov't is carefully NOT talking about:    {A United Nations human rights treaty that could prohibit children from being spanked or homeschooled, ban youngsters from facing the death penalty and forbid parents from deciding their families' religion is on America's doorstep, a legal expert warns.    Michael Farris of Purcellville, Va., is president of ParentalRights.org, chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association and chancellor of Patrick Henry College. He told WND that under the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC, every decision a parent makes can be reviewed by the government to determine whether it is in the child's best interest.}  http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pa...
cACf8VZLaa	Basically yes, but only time will tell if Brown has gambled correctly or made a big mistake. But I support what he has done which seems to be much the same as action taken by President Obama in the USA, by the governments throughout the EU where some economies are in an even worse state than ours (e.g. Ireland) and throughout Asia where some economies are in an even worse state than our (e.g. Japan). Where I think the UK government should be castigated is for aiding and abetting the very extravagant rewarding of Bankers for their failures at UK taxpayers expense. Brown should have taken similar action to President Obama on that. I also think Vince Cable, who basically supports Brown's bailout policies, has shown far more wisdom than any of the financial politicians in Labour  Conservative Parties have, as he saw the crisis coming long before the likes of Brown and Cameron or the so-called experts in the Bank of England did, but regrettably his warnings were not heeded by anybody in authority..|`|mkMJYIJOaa	It doesn't matter what citizens want.    We are being TAXED WITHOUT REPRESENTATION!..f--ked.    and when mr. obama and his gang of thieves crash and burn--libs will be the party to avoid--the tainted ones who ruined our great nation--let this a--hole talk his way into installing his nationalistic-socialised politics--like the nazi party did in germany...    NO MORE WELFARE GIVEAWAYS...let the private markets alone--not for the govt to be involved in how I run my business--THAT's SOCIALISM|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Yes. Democrat.  I heard the "The cost of the plan expanded past $900 billion after the Senate on Tuesday added money for medical research and tax breaks for car purchases." due to the Republicans in the Senate? That was part of the reaching across the isle for bipartisanship.   And "Republicans DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES to stop this bill." is not correct. The bill requires a 2/3rds vote so if the Republicans do not support it, it will not pass.  Delaying passage by the Republicans will amount to "Throwing out the baby with the bath water" with nit picking political positioning. And they will pay a price in the 2010 election for it.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	no--we are throwing kerosene on the fire   ----fiscal conservative|`|AA10239305	NO!

808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I'm not sure but when I heard his news conference about it, something he said worried me..he said that if a business wanted to borrow "extraordinary monies" then they would have a cap put on upper management salaries and other things also would not be tolerated.  When I heard the word extraordinary I was a little concerned, who is going to make that determination on what's extraordinary?  Maybe I'm reading too much into his news conference but I'm on the cynical side..lol|`|9FI7zaKraa	i think the bail out should never have happened, so on one hand if they took money form the fed, they shouldnt complain about the fed taking over its administration and payroll, on the otherhand i see this as the first step to socialism and is was way toooooo easy.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Obama is a con man from Chicago.

However, I do support them being implemented to those receiving bailout monies. It's bad enough that these guys have been rewarded for failure, without robbing tax-payers to pick-up part of the tab. What does scare me about this is that this could be the beginning of salary caps that blanket ALL of corporate America; not just those getting in line for a bailout, at which point we'll no longer be a free country.|`|XbsDGhmNaa	It needed to happen before the banks waste even more tax payer money paying themselves.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	Why is Obama focusing on these Exec's Caps!??? All monies given to these guys should NOT be used for bonuses for them, period! All monies SPENT! should be made PUBLIC as to WHAT they spent it on! It's our money they are giving away. Obama should be concentrating on getting these companies to start operating in the black, meaning quit laying people off, and stop stuffing more bonuses in their little e nest eggs in off shore accounts! THAT also, is something I would put a screaming stop to!!! It's ok putting money into fixing the roads and bridges, but not ALL the unemployed are qualified to do the job! That's wouldn't even cover a fraction of 1% of the work force!  These companies should be using the bail out money to bring back their employees - without them, there will be noone to do the manual work! I can't see these exec's rolling up their selves and getting their hands dirty! Sure, Obama talked a good talk, but I think he may have bitten off more than he can chew! He's the new kid in the Government, and the ancients are sitting there, waiting to swallow him up!|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Maybe Obama should look at HIS own spending and that of his tax-cheating cabinet first.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Whatever, the cap is still too high for my likes!|`|B6c7BeDnaa	what i love about his rhetoric and how blind people really are is that the 700 billion handed out from the first one.THE ACTUAL PLAYERS don't have to do a damn thing.they made sure they protected them from this legislation. gotta love them dems.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	with  the congress approval rating they voted themselves a pay raise is that rewarding failure.

There is the Treason Act, and much case-law.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	If by "capital offence" you mean do we punish treason with the death penalty, then the answer is no. The death penalty was last used in the UK in 1964 for murder and abolition began in 1965. It was formally abolished for treason in 1998.    Terrorism is a blanket term and has no legal definition. This is the source of huge legal and political controversy. Somebody who commits an act of terrorism is normally charged with a more specific crime, such as conspiracy to cause explosions.    Also, just because somebody is accused of something doesn't make them guilty. That remains a key aspect of our legal system and it would seem pointless and bitterly ironic to start abandoning our commitment to it in the case of "terrorists".
OfmTtj68aa	As Roberts points out, the so-called 'terrorist groups', for example Hamas, are fighting back with homemade rockets that are "little more than a sign of defiance". If underground weapon smuggling was so successful in Palestine, the death toll would not have been 100 Palestinians for every 1 Israeli dead.    Arms dealing is given as one excuse for the Massacre of Palestinians in the 2008-2009 conflict. The arms dealers have either been sleeping on the job, or it is an essential farce.|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	Yes, but not just for arms dealers!    Arms dealers are like dogs getting table scraps in the bigger picture.    Even the oil companies are just playing their respective role...    For who, then, you ask?     Who would devise such an evil scam? Who has the means to influence national governments? Who benefits from global-scale crises?|`|uKTVCuOXaa	That's why Palestine and Iran should not give in to bullies, I hope they crush them, a good old fashioned assassination should suit the US just fine Sir as they think it is for them, to judge who should die.

I have a hard time believing that a third-world-like country could have the capability to endure such a long war from a super-power nation. Al qaeda was trained by the CIA when the Afghan people were fighting the Russians. We gave them weapons and training and then more or less contrived their hatred even more toward the US.. and yet, after 911, our government pretends to not know how it happened. During my 7 years of research there is more than enough evidence and proof that our government allowed the attack to happen. The steps taken afterward with Homeland Security and The Patriot Acts were the same steps Hitler took in order to take control of anyone he deemed to be a threat. Hitler blamed a fake enemy: Communists and Jews....Bush blames a terrorist cell that seems more like a figment of someones imagination than a literal threat. No surprise that we will be merging the US with Canada and Mexico into the North American Union, without even being voted on by American citizens as a means of progressing toward a global government. Now it makes perfect sense why Obama is a member of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) which is an organization that owns most of the media outlets and whose main goal is to merge all countries into one single nation. If people don't wake up soon, they will find themselves at the mercy of a government hell-bent on controlling everyone and everything.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Read "THE SHOCK DOCTRINE" by Naomi Klein|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, I agree, but it involves a lot more than that. For example oil merchants, numerous contractors such as catering, private armies like Black Water and so on. Also politicians in the US and in other  countries who profited from the war. So called lawyers who rote up the torture protocols etc.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	no,next!|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Of course! "War on Terror" is such a tedious term...and it is a code for imperialism;-p|`|BrjZhySIaa	Arms dealers and government officials alike, but that's not all...      The war on terror allows the govt to implement unconstitutional practices that would otherwise NEVER be accepted by the public, i.e. wiretapping.    It also allows the government to act as an offensive military unit rather than defense (like it's suppose to; hence the name Dept. of Defense).  When on offense, the options of where the govt. can go and what they can do is greatly expanded.  Meanwhile the sheep of America go along with it and accept it as 'preventive measures.'      It also gives govt. more means of regulation, i.e. "the internet is a great spot for terrorists to recruit members, therefore it must be regulated."    Also keep in mind that the media is essentially employed by the govt. via defense contracts.... NBC is owned by GE.  GE is a top defense contractor.  War benefits defense contractors and subsequently NBC.  Hence the support for promoting this agenda on the part of the mainstream networks.    Ultimately, the 'war on terror' primarily assists globalists and their agenda of creating a one world government.|`|PKfh0jhLaa	Remember the Military Industrial Complex  (and including CONGRESS!)    Yes, its an excuse for War Profiteering (etc...)|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	The most obvious indication that there are no terrorist cells is that not a single neocon has been assassinated.    I do not approve of assassinations, and am ashamed of my countrys government for engaging in political assassination.  The US and Israel have set a very bad example for al Qaeda to follow.    The US deals with al Qaeda and Taliban by assassinating their leaders, and Israel deals with Hamas by assassinating its leaders.  It is reasonable to assume that al Qaeda would deal with the instigators and leaders of Americas wars in the Middle East in the same way.
FCY3lwnoaa	Actually, he explained it very well.    The magnetic poles of our earth have changed many times in the history of the planet.  That has been established by geologists.    Magnetic fields do "hold" (for a lack of a better word) matter and energy together.  It makes sense that a shift in the magnetic fields would create a ripple of shifts.

Without an understanding of quantum physics then you can not possibly understand what he's talking about.    That said, what he said makes a lot of sense. The Mayans did not predict the "end of the world", 2012 is supposed to be the end of the world AS WE KNOW IT. Things will change. It's more of an astronomical change. The Mayan calendar was based on the sky. They were great astronomers and to this day their calendar has never erred. That can be proven. It is scientific fact. And try as you may, but fact can not be disputed.

His parents where low income and had hard times, but she didn't abort him! That's just an excuse for those who are unwilling to take responsibility for there actions!     Its as simple as if your not ready to have a baby... Don't have sex.    It;s not the babies fault the parents are stupid.|`|ho4skDEdaa	Well I'm okay with both abortion and waterboarding...so...I can't say I agree with him there|`|gYfvCkRPaa	Because he is very much like Bill Clinton - going with popular sentiment.|`|6Yq8U8IWaa	bho stated babies are punishment    and now    it's cheaper to abort than give birth-better for the economy if we kill babies      YES WE CAN    IMPEACH THE MAN|`|IH6NrVNBaa	The liberal silence is deafening.|`|cRRk00rgaa	Get it straight.  To begin with "partial birth abortion" is not a medical term.  Secondly, he is against its practice.  The law he apposed was not worded well and left no provision for the mother's medical health and this is why he did not support it.  Please get your facts correct before you make yourself a fool in front of the entire world.  Do not listen to slanted information.|`|5ef5912f6a90f654f9ff6a1087d77a18aa	Facts are that less than 5% of all abortions are due to medical health issues OR the result of rape.  In fact, most abortions are for teens and early 20s when women are most healthy for childbearing.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Obama voted against a NEW Late Term abortion bill.  One that he felt didn't protect the woman's health as well as the current Late Term abortion ban legislation does.  That is far different than your claim.  Waterboarding is against the Geneva Convention.  Waterboarding is against a treaty the US, along with 145 other countries, signed in 1983.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Get your information right. He doesn't approve of partial birth abortion but he doesn't want a law that would ban all abortions.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Its an odd bit of irony isnt it?

On CNN it was the story of the night of it being out lawed to do  .  And the baby thing is between the mother and God  .  If people don't like abortions have them get in line to adopt the children  .  And I can guarantee you that less than 1% of the protesters have adopted a child  .|`|PG2gd1tOaa	I have tried to understand his reasoning, too and I can't..he makes no sense.|`|AA11593971	Very good question, my friend.
u23sBafTaa	Well his ratings have gone down, and stimulus package is really getting a low rating among Americans !   Maybe some are realizing this isn't the right kind of change !|`|SSLekPAnaa	There is a major feeling of 'voter's remorse' here now. Some polls show Obama's numbers to be in the low 40's. Many are harkening back to the good old days of President Bush.|`|DNaMIcomaa	In spite of what you hear from Hannity and Limbaugh people that voted for Barack Obama are not mesmerized by our leader.We recognize the challenges of the presidency and as such we realize that he will not always do things that we agree with.We also recognize that in spite of his efforts to reach across party lines, Republicans are not responding in kind.If you truly believe that your conservative ideology is the right way for the future,you should be concerned about that. Americans are sick and tired of partisan bickering and will remember which party was reluctant to compromise when they go to the polls in 2010 and 2012.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	Yup!

I find it intersting to see that neocons view disagreeing with a policy as buyer's remorse in just three weeks time.|`|kJM65nXJaa	I don't know how it works for republicans, but democrats feel free to disagree with their leaders, while still supporting them.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Just looking at the answers you have here, it seems they are pretty quiet huh? They know it and some just don't want to admit it.    This is not a stimulus bill, it is a massive earmark package. Obama actually said there are not any earmarks "attached" to it. Ha, yeah that's because when the thing is mainly earmarks, you don't need to attach them.    These liberals hacks in power now are the example of complete incompetency at the highest level possible. It truly is amazing.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Those who >pretend|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Last I saw over 65% of all Americans favor the stimulus package.

If they stick a picture of Pelosi's face in front of them, they will beg to talk. Now that's torture.|`|TfXoVfWYaa	How can you be happy about that? Waterboarding is inhumane - it's TORTURE. Are you trying to justify using this?    As for your last point, on his first day in office, Obama issued an executive order outlawing torture (waterboarding included).|`|u23sBafTaa	I agree with Rob however I would included chicken and spineless !|`|8ZN38eapaa	GWB kept us safe from terrorists and democrat leaders!!!

Obviously this calls for a much more complex solution that some nebulous solution on your part that does not take into account the growers, the governments involved, the politics, corporate profit.  Answers are not just wah, wah for the poor workers.
BYu1X7ljaa	Chaves, President of Venezuela. He agrees with democratic socialism and strongly opposes Bush and other capitalist pigs.     Oh and Chavez isnt a terrorist, some people tell me that. He is a rather smart man and from what i know about him so far i agree with alot he says.     He helped the people rise up against Prez's violent and harsh laws etc...|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Only what i've been reading in the available media which in my mind makes everything suspect.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	He placed a one billion dollar weapons order with Russia in 2008.|`|IBXElKCTaa	He hates america? He ordered the U.S. ambassador out of his country.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	He's been in power since 1998...doesn't sound like a President to me...sounds like a dictator.  He is a proponate of democratic socialism.  He's an oil whore who hates Americans and US Forgein Policy.  He refused to renew the license of Radio Caracas Television and many saw that as an attempt to squash free speech.    I could go on all day but like I said he's a dictator disguised as a President.|`|AA10527991	Watch Frontline's show about him.  Okay, it's western media, but it is interesting.|`|60YMS1xkaa	I don't know much about him. I know he was elected. I know he stands strong against the US and has called Bush the "Devil" (are you surprised!?). He's not a dictator, either. No matter what the Americans like to think.    I rather like him from the little I do know.|`|1HQavOGOaa	nothing good|`|sd82DokUaa	I have friends in Venezuela and even when they hate chavez, he was elected by people in 1998 and 2006. In 2006s campaing, he said that he wanted to turn Venezuela into a socialist state and he won that election. He hates Bush. hates Capitalism. He deplores US foreing policies. His country is cut in half ideological speaking, how i know? media there is pretty rough on him.     If you want to know something real about chavez, you have to look it for yourself because here and sites where you ask people about him youre going to find a lot of haters and lot of lovers. An advice, believe anything you want except when information come from FOXX NEWS.

I'm glad you feel that way about your Mom and her family.     But often when people fall in love, it is not because the person is Black or White. I don't know anything about his love life other than his marriage to Michelle. I don't know if he dumped a white girlfriend or that he did because she was white. Maybe they just did not get along. Maybe some people in her life did not approve of her dating a black/biracial man.

I'm glad the topic of race is being more deeply examined now that Obama is in the white house, but lets not allow it to dominate.  Even if you want to call him the first bi-racial president I'm still proud that we have come so far as a nation.    You have some anger issues that you need to work out.  But unless you know President Obama personally, don't assume to know about his personal relationships.
64SObnr5aa	I know I am going to get thumbs down for this, but I believe that financial freedom is the best definition for me.    Why?    Without financial freedom, all the political freedom in the world means squat. If one is continually worried about being able to pay taxes, to being in debt up to their ears in order to live the American dream, isn't that a form of self imposed slavery?    To me, 20 years of not owing a dime to anyone has been the biggest single reason I feel more free. Sure I can stand on a soap box and scream my bloody head off, but that does not put food on the table or allow me freedom to move about. Being in debt can have serious consequences that many of us do not think about.    HOWEVER,    The biggest threat to freedom, to me, is our over burdening tax system.    That is one issue one can not escape, even by living 100% within their means.    But one can limit that if they chose not to live the American dream and putting up with property taxes, which is really another form of rent, because if you don't pay it can all be taken away.

Obama is right about one thing - America voted for him and his program.  ("Spread the wealth" and his other policies didn't sound all that centrist to me.

His campaign rhetoric was exactly that. However, the problems with the stimulus package directly result from two things. First is his insistence that it must be done immediately. This was one of the greatest mistakes in the last package incessant urgency. Now we don't even know where that money actually went. Second is that he has made no attempt to pressure the Democratic Controlled Congress to resist their urges to overspend and fund every pet project under the sun as though the national treasury was their own private piggy bank.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Don't you get it?

Whether McCain was elected or Obama, these problems would have still existed. Bush and Clinton both had cabinet members exposed for tax issues, no presidency is immune from it. The President is trying to do the best with a very bad situation. By the time he took office, Americans were so beaten up by the economy, war and all around struggles that some expected him to waive a magic wand and make all the bad things go away.... it doesn't work like that, its like pissing in the wind.. no matter how bad you gotta go, its spraying right back in your face. The problem with this administration is that since it was such a high profile election and inauguration that everything is being scrutinized. Every presidential campaign goes under fire but all the people that never paid attention to it then are now paying attention and they all seem so appalled, but guess what, its like this with every new president.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	...only if you want to degrade the process of impeachment so that every president from here on out, no matter how good he is, get's impeached at the drop of a hat.

I think you are jumping to conclusions here and really just looking for a negative slant.    Consider the lobbyists ... tobacco, oil companies, chemical companies.  These might offer 'incentives' for a politician to ease the way to a new plant or soften regulations.    But there are also lobbyists for more benign factors, like schools, research and food labeling for example.  I wouldn't lump all lobbyists together because they aren't all sleazy, though I can understand why they would appear that way to a casual observer looking for reasons to condemn a man without giving him a fair chance.

I would only say a number that large because almost every race on this planet has offsprings that are mixed with black. So to get rid of all traces of us you have to find an evil geneologist and  have him test over all the mixed children of the world, yes even the ones in orphanages and the ones living in teeny tiny mud huts in the middle of nowhere. After we're all gone you would probably look around and say hmmm whose going to fnck me now, Im responsible for the genocide for half the earths population, Damn I fncked myself then you'll be assassinated by some surviving black rebellion group.

The people of today will NEVER stand for a global genocide of ANY group of people.  The world would unite and put a stop to it.  Many lessons were learned from WWII, Cambodia, China, and Somalia.  The most obvious one was the realization that the killing happened because no one was watching.  Lesson learned now EVERYONE watches!  This is not say there is no systematic killing going on in our world.  It just says that the elimination of all traces of a specific race cannot happen specially to a group as large as the one your hypothetical question refers too.

Britain, France Holland,Belgium. the germans were not the only ones who wanted to clear jews from their country. and the blockade was just as responsible for the holocaust as Germany was. German children starved because of it. no one wanted to exterminate jews. they just wanted them out of their country..the same can be said for muslims in europe. no one wants them either, but no one is suggesting their extermination. some times cultures just clash, and cannot find middle ground. the answer is to separate and not force the mix on people who know better than to try, and people who simply don't want it. you might ask, if the people of Britain demanded the removal of muslims from their country ,due to the culture clash causing too much trouble, and costing way too much socially. what would we do if the rest of Europe decided that we had to keep them? would we carry on with the social misery. or would we say f*ck you. this is our country and we want them out?....that being the case....will we perhaps be tomorrows Nazis?
PHpKo5hZaa	Middle class Americans are dopier than they look - they actually believe they do have a choice. Both ruling rich class political parties select their presidential candidates outside of any public input. Further, local candidates are selected and funded by the local rich, who are connected to D.C. lobby funds.    The American "democracy" is a puppet stage - you are the audience and the rich class are the puppeteers. The American "democracy" is not at all a democracy - it is a plutocracy. And you vote for whom you're told - given the option of two rich class puppets.    Crime rates increase as the working class is further and further abused, bled, and oppressed. Greed within an unregulated business environment grows unchecked to the point of abuse of assets, thievery, and bribery. All D.C. aristocrats are bought and sold prior to being granted opportunity for election, and once elected the band of them pass law after law in furtherance of exclusively rich class objectives.

If you are talking about the general public, most vote as if it were a popularity contest. I have had many political discussions over the past 3 elections. Very few knew more than what they saw on TV. The problem there is many just listen to the commentary provided surrounding the topic, instead of using their own critical thinking skills. It was also scary to hear how many people were voting on the basis of superficial qualities.    I commend you for taking the stance you have chosen, no matter what your politcal leaning is. The important thing is that you are completely informed when you make your choice.

Prejudice is the attitude of aversion and a feeling of superiority towards people of different cultures or races. Prejudice is basically a thought, but can become discrimination when the thought gets put into action; i.e., not being friends with someone because of their race, or making racial remarks towards someone of a different race. To a degree we are all prejudice because we're not all completely neutral. Many people label people as racists when they are really prejudice, and this is happening a lot in our society. There is a big difference between the two.    To be a racist, one must be in a position where he/she has authority or power over other people. In other words, if I'm not in a position where I can take away someone's freedom or liberty, (like a cop), or prevent a person from getting employment because of their race, I cannot be a racist. Again, before one can be a racist, he/she must be in a position where they have power or authority over other people that can affect that person's life, simply because of their race.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	I do not believe that one must be compelled to like people of other nations or races.

lERouzRYaa	Has she been seeing her probation officer as directed? Surely her probation officer would know if they can take her refund. Also they would have warned her, perhaps several times, of the consequences of not complying with the terms of ones probation. Where I live, the next step would be for them to have an arrest warrant issued. After her arrest, a hearing would be held to decide if she should be required to serve her original sentence in jail. She should contact her probation officer and ask.  If she has been keeping her appointments and has been really trying, then perhaps they will allow her time enough to get her refund and pay them.  The amount needed to pay the probation department may be larger than you think. Here, in addition to restitution + court costs, the probation department is allowed to add monthly fees for it's services,   about $35 per month ( that is what they were here several years ago).  I think that rather than give her the $'s to pay with, you should make the payment yourself and consider it a gift as there is no guarantee that she will pay you back.   If you pay it for her, then she might decide to keep her refund considering she is jobless.

U mean India is not bothered then for what the fk India is said to be a south Asian giant?    Then for what the fk India is training the sri lankan sinhalese army and air force crew at this critical point of time of war in lanka, they were trained in chennai and once found by the people in Tamil Nadu , they were sent to Karnataga.    Then for what the f"k Indian Govt sent armed representatives from India?     Ok sri lanka problem is sri lanka prob, to the hell with sri lanka , cz we are India and we only bother abt India and Indians,   when the Indian Tamil fishermen wer killed what fk did the Indian Congress Govt did? did it voice oot against sri lanka not to kill or shoot the "INDIAN" fishermen of Tamil nadu, instead the Indian navy itself were sabotaging Tamils in Tamil nadu helping sri lankan govt    when shiv shankar menon went to sri lanka he was suppose to condemn sri lanka or tell them not to shoot Indian Fishermen, instead he praised Kotabaya and the army general of  Sri lanka who is condemned by the Internationl Law chief saying that he should be prosecuted, but India s treating otherwise....    pranab mukerji went sri lanka to so call talk cock, what happen the following day, few army tanks were sent from southern India    for what the fk is India doing this if they are not involve ?

There are a few options, coming in as a tourist with the intention of marrying and not leaving  is illegal but people do it and then adjust status but its risky , however your intent is difficult to prove and it happens. Your other option and is the one I chose was to marry in the US with proof that I intended to return, go back to the UK and then my husband came to the UK for a while  petitioned me from London and the went back to the US ahead of me and we waited it out, it was very quick for him to come to the UK , he got his visa in one day as my husband, he stayed long enough to qualify to petition me and left. This way we cut out all the UCIS wait time and it only took 4 months, if you petition him from the US you can double that waiting time, possibly longer. You can also apply for the fiance visa which is supposed to be quicker although in reality it isn't always , he comes over on that visa and you  have 3 months to marry .Unfortunately unless you want to take a risk and bring him over on a tourist visa there is no quick and easy route. An Irish passport won't make any notable difference and you are one of thousands with the same story. You have to choose between illegal entry and hope they buy it, a fiance visa with marriage when he gets here, or marriage first and then petition. The last two have similar time lines and an inevitable separation.|`|0b87103374738a74c6669593b14b6307aa	I am from the UK, my husband is a US citizen and I now have my greencard (since Apr 08)  The only difference is, I was already in the US working when I met my husband and got married, so we filed everything here at the same time. All I had to do was adjust status. You have a few options.      You can apply for a fiance visa, which would allow your wife to come to the USA, get married (within 90 days of entry) and then she can stay here whilst you sponsor her for her green card.    You can get married (in USA or UK) and then apply for a K3 spouse visa. Once approved your wife could come to the USA whilst you sponsor her for her visa - I guess it just depends where etc you want to get married. She would have to remain outside the USA though until the visa is approved.    When you file for her green card you will file several forms, one is called an I 485 - Adjustment of Status.  As you probably know, the UK participates in the Visa Waiver program.... this allows people to enter the USA without a visa. I always understood that you couldn't come to the USA under the visa waiver program and adjust status to a green card, but there is a section in the I 485 form that states, if you come to the USA as the parent, spouse or unmarried child of a US Citizen - therefore an immediate relative then you can use the I 485 to adjust their status. So in theory, you can get married, then have your 'wife' enter from the UK under the visa waiver program, and apply to adjust her status over here, that is the least expensive way as you won't have to apply for a K visa.    It's really up to you which route you want to take......

If she leaves some of them at home while at work, I would find out just how much the retail price of these gifts are!  What is your daughter's reaction to all this attention? Yes, the first thing that went through my mind was, the boss is gay, and has the hots for your daughter!!  Is this woman married? How old is she? Does your daughter go out with her after work hours? Something else that has crept into my mind, and it isn't very good. Sometime or another, has your daughter found out something about this woman, and could be blackmailing her!? God forbid, I hope not! Truthfully, I would hire a P.I. and have them BOTH investigated. Something is definately not right!

He will look to see if her needs can be met in her dad's home, and if it is a safe environment for her.  If it didn't matter much, then they wouldn't waste the money doing the studies.    As far as what a 7 year old child wants, although the judge may consider it, nobody is stupid enough to consider a child's desire over the safety and stability in a home.

nklAZHqIaa	How Long Do We Have??  About the time our original thirteen states adopted their new constitution in 1787, Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh, had this to say about the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years earlier:    "A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government."    "A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury."    "From that moment on, the majority always vote for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally  collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship."    "The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years"    "During those 200 years, those nations always progressed through the following sequence:    1. from bondage to spiritual faith;  2. from spiritual faith to great courage;  3. from courage to liberty;  4.from liberty to abundance;  5. from abundance to complacency;  6. from complacency to apathy;  7. from apathy to dependence;  8. From dependence back into bondage"    Professor Joseph Olson of Hemline University School of Law, St. Paul, Minnesota, points out some interesting facts concerning the 2000 Presidential election:    Number of States won by:  Gore: 19  Bush: 29    Square miles of land won by:  Gore: 580,000  Bush: 2,427,000    Population of counties won by:  Gore: 127 million  Bush: 143 million    Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by:  Gore: 13.2  Bush: 2.1    Professor Olson adds: "In aggregate, the map of the territory Bush won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of this great country. Gore's territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in government-owned tenements and living off various forms of government welfare..." Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the "complacency and apathy" phase of Professor Tyler's definition of democracy,  with some forty percent of the nation's population already having reached the "governmental dependency" phase.

Sadly, most  of the carpetbaggers benefiting were often in bed- literally, in the case of the Energy Department-  with government officials.    Obama is wise enough to take ideas from other places and sift through what's good or bad about them. Leeching off the wealth? One could ask- how was the wealth gained? Was this wealth gained from policies that leeched off of the less fortunate (see bank or mortgage gains) or was the wealth gained from leeching from the wealthy (see Maldoff).     Whatever the case the fiscal policies (read rampant unstrained capitalism/no oversight/no regulation) of "compassionate conservatism" weren't even illusionist tricks with mirrors, they were empty rhetoric.     Apparently, your version of the American dream is to look for ethical loopholes where you can screw someone legally  then retire, all the while complaining about those 'leeching' off the wealthy while fat cats play in their money pool a la Scrooge McDuck.     Disparity is disparity.     Bush created record deficits. If socialist means government spending, he most certainly was, though his support of megacorporations was more on the definition of fascist. He outsourced government duties like no tomorrow. Many of his corporate buddies made billions- much on no bid contracts. The excesses were so much that one could question many of the motivations for his national and international policies.      These are things conservatives don't talk about. And no wonder their media networks and leaders make this a taboo subject as they have benefited enormously. Unfortunately, the price tag for these folks to make out like bandits was the world economy got nuked and we are now looked at internationally with scorn and scepticism.     And all you folks can talk about is welfare, Obama is a socialist- after a few weeks in office.     Obama brings something to the table that has been missing the past 8 yrs- he doesn't need sychophantic yes men to boost his inferiority complex, he can consider other ideas, and he can admit mistakes.     It would be refreshing for the other side to put aside their hate and look at the failings of their own party, the party that got Obama elected.     It wasn't the Democratic Party that got Obama elected- that's for sure.|`|NIsRQR2caa	THe history of the US is one of welfare...historically, white people benefited from government favoritism and government handouts...you do know that?|`|m1T2fSnHaa	Im starting to think Obama's plan is to collapse the USA.

Most countries in the world have absolutely no means for a person with no income to survive other than begging on the streets.    countries like Panama have no child support laws so if a women has a child, it is up to her to care for the child.    You have been bamboozled into thinking that the US welfare program is the root of our economic downfall.  fact is this mess started in the early 80's with the Reaganomics trickle down economic theory.  Only in America can a company loss 70% of it's stock value, lay off thousands of workers and then reward the CEO with a multi million dollar bonus.    Look up these guys and find out about real "welfare"    Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron  Joe Nacchio, former CEO of Qwest  Dennis Kozlowski former CEO of Tyco  John Rigas and sons, Former owner and CEO of Aldelphia cable  Bernie Ebbers, former CEO of World COM    these people collectively put millions out of work, destroyed 401K plans, and I am sure added many of the former employees to the food stamp roles.    and your angry because people want to eat.    you better wake up and smell the coffee

Socialism sounds good in theory but historically it consistently fails to promote prosperity among the masses.     That is why so many socialist countries remain third-world countries.    The fact that a majority of socialist countries are severely impoverished third-world countries, ruled by despotic greedy leaders, strongly indicates that socialism is not a workable model for prosperity among the common man.     It appears that in most strongly socialist countries the financial chasm between the very few chosen elite and the common man grows wider.    Also there are shrinking opportunities for the common man to become wealthy through hard work and determination.

fP8H3n3baa	1919-1920s -- Jacob Schiff, EM House & cronies started the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Yes, Schiff, Warburg and others were certainly part of Rothschild's Illuminati.    1913 - President Woodrow Wilson publishes "The New Freedom" in which he reveals: "Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U.S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."     In the early 1950s, Myron Fagan "outed" the CFR and Illuminati in a radio program.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MonNSusdT...  http://www.apfn.org/APFN/illuminati.htm    After that, the CFR scrambled to "legitimize itself." Just like the way defense attorneys overload their opponents with tons of information, boxes and boxes of stuff, the CFR has an outer periphery of "dupes," who will proclaim the goodness and innocence of the CFR. As well, they have a website that comes up (as well as other friendly sites) when doing a websearch.  http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/...|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	I actually think the CFR is a newer group.

But given everyone involved I would say the illuminati has much to do with it.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	I think so. Do a search for illuminati and read about it. There seems to be so much that a common dude has no control over. The deck does seem stacked. Historically, the conspiracy puzzle pieces fit together more logically than our written history. Who is really in charge of a lot of the world events?     Most of us don't want reject what we have learned in school or beliefs that we once held dear. But if you venture out and learn about what really may be going on, It may enlighten you. The problem is, what do you believe and what do you throw out as BS? There is a lot of scary stuff that can ruin your day if you let it. And its difficult to understand what you can change if anything at all.     Recently, the fed chairman suddenly went to congress and announced that the world is coming to an end if they don't give billions and billions of tax payer money to the large banks. Now neither congress or us knows where that money went. Is congress incompetent or liars? Is this by accident or a well orchestrated plan? Money is power. The money isn't in the publics' hands, its somewhere else.

Obama became president because the republicans were associated with the bad economy. If the economy is bad in 2012, the GOP will re-take the white house.  The fact is, we are not a communist country, therefore the president does not control the economy.  While economists claim that they know how the economy works and how a government can fix it, they really don't. We might as well hire a witch-doctor to cast some spells for us.    The hidden agenda is ,...IF the economy is good in 2012, Obama can claim that his stimulus plan is what fixed it.

Republicans are under pressure from mayors and governors to get this bill passed.  I say, if they want the pork out, then lead the way, and don't let any Republican senators, governors, mayors have a dime.  That will fix the costs of the bill, and will guarantee that we won't have to deal with any remaining Republicans in the next election.

Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are in Congress and therefore bear significantly more blame than anyone for over-regulating the economy (and thereby slowing it causing the recession).  D. The Jobless Claims number is irrelevant since it only tracks people petitioning for benefits.  E.

People have no money to purchase.  No purchasing?  Companies close  More jobless.  Unemployment will bankrupt states  We are a republic.  Fed will loan money to pay unemployed.  Unemployment runs out in what six months?  No jobs  No money  Desperation kicks in.  Police cannot afford to hire more officers to protect the wealthy.  We outnumber them 50,000 to 1  The rich will be the last to become poor.  They will loose everything.    VISA is making money.  Why?  transaction fees.  More people are charging it because they have no money.  Retailer pays 2% per transaction.  When the credit card companies see more trans fees it means the cash has run out and folks are eating from plastic.  This is a bad thing.    Capitalism is good.  Greed is bad.  The greedy have killed Capitalism.    The Have's and Have Not's get farther apart everyday.  It scares me.  Desperation is about to kick in.    What is going to replace our style of government when the right succeeds in making our president fail.  They prove themselves right.  They ruin our country in the process.

And that is the kind of nation we are.    -Colin Powell    If America is an empire it really needs to work on that expansion thing.

reeU4N0eaa	1. La Raza and and their ilk would be classified as terrorist organizations and all their assets would be frozen.    2.  English would be made the official language.  Banks with ATMs that ask if you want to continue in English and companies with customer service telephone menus that ask to press 1  for English will be ineligible for bailout money.    3.  All government forms (including voter registration forms) will be in English.    4.  Anchor babies will no longer become US citizens and parents of anchor babies will not be given the protection of resident aliens.    5.  US Military will patrol the border - the mission along the DMZ and in the Balkans has well prepared them for this task.    6.  All hospitals or health clinics that accept federal money must refuse to provide services to illegals.  Any private hospitals/clinics that want to do so may, but they will not receive on dime in federal money when on the verge of financial ruin.    7.  All Wire Transfers sending money to Latin America will be subject to a 35% surcharge that will be used to finance construction to the border fence.|`|uu6JYenAaa	I would put out an immediate arrest warrant for all illegals.  Round them up and send them home with a warning that should they be found inside our borders again, as an illegal, they will be arrested with no questions asked.    I would then station enforcement personell along the border with orders to shoot to kill.  That should deter any attempts to cross into the U.S.    I would enforce stiff penalties on any individual or corporation that knowingly hires an illegal.  And that would include Congressmen, Police, Churches, Homeowners, etc.    Request that Mexico force the illegals who have moved back to Mexico to return our cash money that the illegals sent home to live on.  Yeah, that will happen..LOL    Then.....to cap it off, I would make it absolutely mandatory that these efforts were 100% enforced, again, with no questions asked.|`|0c338ca1fa4feadaf2979b7b59e65cebaa	The slow economy is actually doing a better job of slowing illegal immigration than the last few presidents have done.  But, if I were president, I would focus on securing the border first. I would replace the border patrol with a branch of the military, increase the use of technology to monitor the border, increase and improve fences along the border and increase the use of all types of technology such as unmanned aircraft and ground sensing equipment to detect tunnels being dug.  I think the border has to be secured before anything else is successful.

But now I am inclined to just let Obama use them as slaves, so I can stay home all day.  The government is giving me food, shelter and health care, so *somebody* needs to work, but I don't see why it should be me.|`|MntRFqtHaa	God what a mess this is.   First, I would secure the borders to stop even one more from coming across.     Second, something must be done to raise the level of oppertunities for those in Mexico to where they no longer need to come here in order to just live.   This is the tricky part.  How do you raise the standards of living in Mexico, without lowering them here?  They have a population of 106 million.  There must be ways that we can work with them to help increase the living standards so that 'home' would be the place of choice.    I know that is tricky but with the right minds, correct trade agreements it could be done.    Perhaps investments by US companies into farming and food production would be a start.  Large scale farms could be created to not only help feed these people but at the same time create employment for them as well.  Due to the extream heat and sun exposure, it might as well be possible to work to create solar farms to produce electricity that could be sold back into Texas and CA.    For the millions all ready here, I would go on a case by case basis.  Do they already have jobs and pay taxes.  If so, then they should go into a list to become citizens if they so choose.  If they do not want to become citizens then they should be deported.  If the man is unable to provide for his family then others such as the wife, should be trained for employment as well.  The job here is to get the family to be self sufficient.  Mandatory English classes should be required for all family members who do not speak or write English. Area;s already saturated with Latinos, should sit limits on how many will be allowed to live in these areas.   The US is huge,  We should not allow little nations to be built in the center of states.  As new immigrants come in, they should be encouraged to locate in areas with smaller concentrations of immigrants. Education is a big factor, all citizens need to be educated.   If any child fails to put forth the effort to be taught then, they should be pulled from school and taught a skill that will enable them to be self sufficient.     Yes, we are a nation of immigrants, but for the most part the past immigrants assimilated into the nation its self.  The did not refuse to learn the language or be part of the community.      No one should be given a free ride.  If you want to reap the benefits of the US, you should be willing to work to be a productive part of the nation.|`|gBAstki5aa	i would use cattle prods to move all the females out of the US and nuke china with chocolate milk powder.|`|6UmjlJHTaa	I would make a big announcement and say that if this does not stop,we will immediately tke all our tanks and finish then up and then start like a fresh man again lolz|`|R5f4MjZcaa	I would add a project to the stimulus plan that would actually help the economy.  I would determine how much money it would take, on average, to build a good fence.  Give each boarder state that amount with the stipulation that they have a specific amount of time to build the best fence they can with the money.    I would also inform the states that at the end of the allotted time the fence would be inspected, and tested to see how well it worked.  The findings would be published, so if they tried to scam some money for themselves their state would be deemed the best place to cross.|`|DBIKou8faa	Enforcing the law would be a good start.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	they would be  deported, and no one  will enter  USA illegally|`|1oj4aamaaa	Require them all to smuggle marijuana into the U.S. to meet the demand.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Deportation, send all of them back.

AA10152346	I feel wonderful. While I think my kids will be covered from my and my husband's job. I think for all other kids who need it is great. I just mentioned that to one of my daycare teachers last night she almost cried in joy. She works as an early education teacher and also has to work at a fast food place part time because she can't make ends meet. With all that she can't afford health insurance for her kid. Now he's covered. I'm happy.    This from another contributor from the UK:    FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.     FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.    That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare ...    http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...|`|DnWsMhwLaa	I look forward to one day having an effective health care system for everyone, instead of one strong armed by insurance companies and drug companies.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Boo hoo!

kZeu2Dyzaa	Every group of people who have ever come here have been treated poorly by those who are already here.    The difference between those people and the black community is that the other immigrants took steps to integrate themselves into mainstream American culture and thereby remove the ability of the mainstream American to discriminate against them. The black community has refused to integrate (based on their ridiculous belief that "the man" is out to get them) and instead has created their own "culture" (African-American). This action openly states that they have no interest in joining America and therefore they are still a target.    All remaining racism in this country is due to the fact that the blacks are holding a grudge and extending their own "pledge period" (Yes, that's right. Real life is a lot like a Fraternity in that the people in charge make the rules and if you don't follow them you are an outcast).|`|6qyrhgjwaa	No Pres.

I think that was the only topic I ever won debating him. Most racists in my town, are the manoritys themselves. I'm wetto to Mexicans, honky to blacks. Most of the Mexicans are illegal. I wasn't racest when I moved here but I am becoming one. I know in my head it's enviroment and not race. But we have no problem with white gangs where I live.

Why should I buy junk. I have never bought an American made car and I never intend to. The US gov't when using my tax money has an obligation to buy the best products at the lowest price regardless of where that product is made!! For the American economic system to work ALL consumers have an obligation to buy the best product for the least price. Doing otherwise is hurting all American consumers. Remember buying American only helped make the recession of 1929 into the great depression. So buy Toyota and know you have helped the US economy. Buy GM or Ford and you just helped the crooks who took off with your tax dollars!!!!!!

Nuclear weapons are in this world, and we have to adjust to that, not ignore it. The Cold War, was unfortunately living proof that these weapons do actually act as a deterrent, and as a result keep the peace. Think of the world as being in a Mexican Standoff.  Many countries not registered as having a nuclear arsenal have these weapons also, so it would be disasterous to simply get rid of them.

tyvFUPOxaa	Denying the truth, no matter how unfavorable, must not be allowed by anyone--least of all a clergyman. The holocaust ranks among the worst atrocities against any group of mankind; and it should be taught to prevent anything like it from ever happening again. But being German would make it more difficult to discuss; especially, if others might associate you more closely to the horrible event carried out in your homeland by your own people.    As for the Pope being perfect, the history of western civilization is full of Papacy mistakes. How many bloody crusades or wars were started by these so-called perfect men or Christians? How many Middle Eastern citizens have had their blood spilled in their homelands for Popes? Too often, the Popes are just Pharisees (politicians)  with a different name.|`|ToztjpAsaa	He can deny it all he likes, it won't change the fact that it happened.

This guy was a complete jerk and a hate monger. The Catholic Church really needs to excommunicate him. I could try and deny that he exists but one can not argue with facts. The holocaust DID occur. It was a crime against humanity that can never be forgotten. In forgetting history we are doomed to repeat it.|`|JQXFG2ABaa	Though no sensible person can deny the Holocaust (and surely we  have enough evidence with film and personal accounts) I suppose  the chap is entitled to his views ,offensive as they might be to the  Jewish people,Gypsies etc.|`|U8XTbQgraa	the Pope was a member of the Hitler youth and now we have bishops denying the Holocaust.The Holocaust is undeniable but whether it was exaggerated is another question.It has certainly got my attention and i am doing a bit of research in my spare moments|`|eTspmrjMaa	Yes of course they should because it's existence is very questionable. The world seems to be under a spell whereby you cannot talk about the holocaust unless you agree that it happened exactly the way that we are told it happened. Sure hundreds of thousands of Jews died during world war two at the hand of the Nazi regime maybe even millions but to make it so that anyone who questions the holocaust and how it happened and how many died should go to prison is a complete and utter disgrace. At least 40 million or so other civilians died during world war two and it's perfectly ok to question the amount of those people that weren't Jews that died. Jews are not special, they are just humans like all the rest of us.    http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Th...    http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Th...    This video in two parts made by a Jew about Auschwitz is interesting to say the least and would probably help to make people understand at least a bit of what life was like for the people that resided in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. I say people because it wasn't only Jews that died in these camps.|`|v5BwnUZdaa	what holocaust|`|muzRC2TGaa	Of course not, no one should because it tragically and clearly did happen and not that long ago either.|`|tmUIYXlIaa	I think that religious figures and thier institutions should be focused on truth.  It seems that the Vatican is not only trying to repair it's own internal relations, but it did request for a recant of the position.  The church may very well still excommunicate him, but not without ensuring it's took steps avoiding schism.      As far as the hitler youth thing, grow up people - obviously he did, you might find that your views of the world change too.  As far as the numbers - There are those that seek to ultimately deny the existence of the holocaust and have tried to downplay the numbers that may or may not have been Jews as if it matters less that less Jews or less homosexuals or less (insert group here).   Keep in mind that when you hear these arguments that the idea that a threshold exists that may have been okay.  That is where the evil of the argument lies.|`|IMvB9c2Saa	If they believe the holocaust didn't happen, they should be allowed to say so much as someone who believes 6 BILLION "undesirables" were killed during the holocaust should also be allowed to say so. I, personally,     The fact they are religious figures is irrelevant. Everyone, even if they are a religious figure in a one person non religion should be allowed to have an opinion and express it peacefully and respectfully.    Some of the most impressive people I have met have been Jews but I don't see why Israel has any more right to exist than any of the other countries that human history allows to appear and disappear.    Arguing that Israel has a right to exist is the same as arguing the settlers should get out of the US and let the American Indians have it all to themselves isn't it? maybe the Moors should be allowed to have Spain, the British Should get out of Northern Ireland, the Australians should let their land be Aboriginal again, the Maoris can have New Zealand back ..... anyone going back thousands of years can argue somewhere they believe is there "home" should be theirs and use force to win it back. That, to me sounds like a recipe for never ending global strife and terrorism.    Having read what I can about the subject, I doubt "undesirables" were gassed. There are a myriad of reasons how people may have died in the concentration camps. Some groups organised themselves very well and would murder other prisoners. Typhus was rife and spread by the human louse which Zyklon B, the hydrogen cyanide based pesticide killed. I'm still reading, Still trying to work out the truth. The Nazi regime built infrastructure (like gas chambers for fumigating railway carriages) MUCH more suited for gassing large numbers of people than the alleged gas chambers at the concentration camps (which were better designed for delousing clothes and bedding).  The Nazis kept meticulous records so the logistical feat of having the resources to round up, congregate, transport, interview and process then exterminate people on such a scale then dig holes for their graves? Even in peace time Europe in 2009, I don't know many countries that now have the resources to achieve such a feat let alone a Nazi Germany fighting wars on so many fronts and on the verge of collapse.    I would like to have the right to discuss with other people my CURRENT views on the Holocaust and feel free to change them and continue to discuss them until I am satisfied I have arrived at a truth that suits me.
MI9zXGEOaa	Much like the United Kingdom's stimulus plan, it's just wrong to assume you know how it's going to pan out.

In case you didn't notice, we had a President for the past 8 years who had huge spending bills with quite a bit going to the wrong country to fight a "war on terrorism."    By the end of his term, Gas prices were rising high due to speculators thinking that oil reserves would run out and thereby causing prices upwards of $4 a gallon plus.   Of course when the demand eased, prices tumbled without having to drill.    But the hike in gas already did the damage by increasing the costs of goods to offest the increase.   From the price of milk and bread to having to pay to check your luggage in all increased.    So now you are going after our new President for spending.    Where were you with the last one?   Was it because this one has a D next to his name and the other had an R?       That is what is wrong with America.   D's and R's are not football teams.   The Presidency isn't the Super Bowl and enough with the Red States and Blue States, because in the end we're the United States and this division has to stop.

He just demonstrated again yesterday that his allegiances do not lie within the country that elected him.|`|PHpKo5hZaa	The thing is - Bush didn't screw up at all. He fully intended to bend you over and rob Iraq for the benefit of his military general buddies. Bush was a great success.|`|VtOn0uhKaa	Definitely the latter. At least Obama is making good on a promise that he would have a transparent government that would openly admit their mistakes. George W could not even think of what he did wrong when asked.|`|ApFh12Sqaa	Both|`|CBx6qHztaa	Your screen name is appalling.|`|b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa	One day, you will see that you have been sadly mistaken|`|A6q6Ravhaa	Your new one said it and those words will replace  hope  and  change "I SCREWED UP YES I CAN"

There is more than enough physical evidence to prove Obama/Satoro can not be president, where Obama/Satoro has not ONE piece of physical evidence to prove otherwise.  Yeah he's in right now but soon he will be removed.  This has been an ongoing issue long before the election.  But as we all know the wheels of justice are slow.  The case is now so powerful even the big news stations can't ignore this story much longer. Its been on FOX  but as we all know the big news companies that democrats watch are 90% for the democratic party.   Brace yourself its happening.|`|X1bKThZ1aa	Too late.|`|wbIEau0qaa	they would impeach him, that said, bush was arguably the worst president in history, so i doubt they'll impeach him over 3 weeks work|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Impeachment, and it goes to Biden,    And yes, it is amature night at the whitehouse.

You may want to ask them that question. Most Americans never saw Obama as a Messiah. Some people in foreign countries may have seen that, but that's their problem. Obama will make changes for the good of the country. We've already seen the changes that Bush made. Almost 9% unemployment rate. Stock Market falling as low as 7000pts. Millions of lost jobs throughout the country. Now you know why Democrats were pissed off when Bush won the 2nd term. Republicans really need to STFU about Obama, because their choice for president caused us to be where we are today. Republicans complain about Obnama, but we are where we are today because of YOU. Idiots.|`|H7i4sO8Eaa	America got what they elected....    A community organizer with 18 months experience as a junior senator.

I'm against the bailout.  No one is helping me, or mine.  It isn't going to do anything, just like the big bank bailouts.      Banks could have avoided a huge portion of this, if they'd only worked with the borrowers.  People didn't want to lose their homes, but the banks weren't/aren't helping them out!  So, what do they do with out tax dollars?  The continue with the huge bonuses.

This is just the beginning step to socialized medicine , plus he is already dictating how much a CEO can make if they accepted a bailout and apparently it is in the works to try and cap ANY CEO's pay .|`|64SObnr5aa	Socialism:  All aspects of business is controlled by the state. There is no private enterprise.    We are not socialistic  Nor is Obama    We are a republic with democratic principles with a regulated capitalistic economic system and socialism for needed services with a communist public land system. All countries that claim they are a democracy are roughly the above.    What we need in this country to shut down these insane profits and the huge box stores putting the little guy out of business thru more regulation of capitalism.    Pure capitalism will eventually result in a no middle class, a handful of rich people and everyone else poor.    That is why France, Cuba, China and others went through revolutions.    Peace  Jim    .|`|NIsRQR2caa	Nope but Social Demo crayy is a good thing....America has always been a social democracy...except it wasbeneficiall to only one group of people primarily...now, true equity and justice are on the way|`|PHpKo5hZaa	We sure hope so. The roller coaster ride of Wall Street rich class economics is too dizzying to last for too long.    If continuing the rich class spoon-feed of working class blood and guts, at today's juncture we begin the oft-repeated cycle of selling worthless corporate securities into the vast melt of working class pensions, building up the selling price of the securities to the level of a bubbling pot, at which near-future time the rich class will skim all the value into their own personal savings caches on tax shelter islands such as the Isle of Man. At which time the market will ultimately crash yet again from the profits skimmed out all at once by the rich class thieving bankers, while the working class pensions fund the bill. Then the process will begin yet again - by now-obvious design of course.    The working class is finally smartening up after 200 years, and aren't falling for the scam anymore. We're having the rich class for lunch tomorrow.    Thanks for your question! Very heartening opportunity.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	No, it's neo-Marxism. Impeach Obama.|`|m16dhfrGaa	You know, I would rather see government use our money to fund education, transport systems and health services than the military industrial complex.  If we can get just a little bit socialist in the aspects that improve peoples chances of being healthy enough to work, educated enough to hold a decent job and being able to get to work easily, I think the capitalist society would benefit more of us.|`|7PTZJ74vaa	so?cial?ism    Pronunciation:   \?s-sh?-?li-z?m\   Function:   noun   Date:   1837   1: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods    This is the definition of socialism according to Websters online dictionary. So lets try it on to see if it fits shall we. The government now has control of the 9 largest banks in the country. The government is now telling private companies how much they can pay their employees. The President has unapologetically stated his intention to redistribute the wealth. Wells Fargo bank told the government that they did not need the bailout money nor did they want it. They were forced to take it, and now are being told how they can spend it. The auto manufacturers must now report to the government for approval on how they operate their business, including Ford who says they do not want bailout money. It walks like a duck, acts like a duck, and smells like crap (duck crap that is) ITS A DUCK PEOPLE!  P.S. I do not listen to talk radio I just have a brain that functions correctly and all by itself.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	People who don't like Obama are just racists in denial.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	!!!!

ZTc7rE1Haa	Yes, it did kill off freedom of speech for a time, but I think it's now having the opposite effect, and rightly so. Many people, myself included, have said that enough is enough and have started to speak out about this nonsense. You only have to look at some of the questions and answers on here to see that many people have had enough of being told what we can and cannot say.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	I dont think its the political correctness, its the tabloids reporting about it that really angers people. Think about it, has anybody here actually had any problems with political correctness in their day to day lifes? For a majority of us, it will be no, we only think its gone crazy because we read about it all the time in articles, and these articles deliberatly make things sound worse than it really was, to get people angered and talking, which sells them more papers    We need to take a good look at other countries to realise how lucky we really are to have the freedom we have here, even though there are a few rare moments of madness, i'd rather live like this then what the other half of the world have to put up with, there are many people that get tortured and beaten into voting for a patricular government. So it is ludicrous to even suggest we dont have enough freedom of speech here|`|wE8NppnLaa	YES, professionals can be sacked for a slip of the tongue (re Carol Thatcher).

It's better that most places around the world though.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	I don't think it's so much killing freedom of speech (although to certain extent I think it is) but it's putting up barriers where it's meant to be taking them down. For example, I was at a course for work and we were all told how to talk to people who were in some way disabled. By giving us a lesson on how to handle a specific group of people, it's alienating them from everyone else. It seems only the average people here, rather than those in power can appreciate the irony of it.|`|ounWvY70aa	We don't have freedom of speech. That's an American thing.

At the moment illegal immigrants are infringing upon our rights, and the PC liberals would allow them to do so. What bothers me is the liberals have lost what it means to be an American citizen.|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	You are exaggerating, they are only blamed for their fair share.  They have contributed to our bad economy and high crime rate.  And everyone on this planet contributes to pollution. I don't believe in global warming.  It would be nice if they all went home and then we could prove one way or the other who is right, huh! illegal supporters or anti-illegals.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	There is more than one reason our economy is down and the literally tens of millons of illegal criminal aliens leeching off benefits and services they aren't legally entitled to, and illegally working in millions of jobs in nearly every job field means there are millions LESS jobs that are available for American citizens and LEGAL immigrants.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	If all the illegal immigrants in the US were deported, who are anti-illegal immigration activist.......?  going to blame the bad economy on: with billions NOT being sent out of the country, wages no longer being depressed, billions in taxes being paid, billions in federal services not being given to criminals it will definitely help the economy,   the rise in crime: with 1/3 less crime who would complain?  blight and global warming: now your just being silly! Nobody blames them for those 2!  With 350,000 less incidents of child molestations, 10,000 less deaths, 837,000 less injuries, 1/3 less crime, billions saved, etc. The US would be a much better place!|`|sIvUjRT3aa	Well lets deport them all and find out.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	I don't know who or what would be next, but I would be willing to find out. Deport ALL people that have no legal right to be here. Lets see where things go from there. Not to mention that if we deport all illegals then we will not be paying for them to be here and we can use that money for other things...|`|ipqxNSvCaa	Better question yet--were all illegal aliens sent back to their home countries, just who would their home countries blame THEIR problems on?  As it is, they're using the US as a dumping ground for their problems, often claiming that they're "owed" for some reason or another--that the US "stole" their land or is responsible for their civil war (in civil wars, it's countryman against countryman, but I guess somehow we magically force them to fight) or that global ("U.S.") corporations have harmed them (why isn't THEIR government protecting them) or that we should ignore illegal immigration because it's a "human right".|`|6oQatiwjaa	Im sure no one would disagree that the illegal migration has cost money BUT I simply do not believe our country is in the mess its in now because of 20,000,000 mexicans thought to be living illegally in our country.  George Bush II would be the main suspect .  * you guys can hack me to death if you want but I truly believe this.|`|uPNP1xzpaa	believe me, they will blame those illegals left the big mess for them to clean. The economy issues is really affected by the fed. policies. While a country's old administration encouraged business to move outsides of the country, here it leaves a question that how Americans gonna find jobs?

We are all, different shades of brown..... depending on how much pigment is in the skin...Why can't everyone accept that everyone is different in some way and take a person as he or she is... and get along with each other without getting a race into the situation. Things that happened in the past is the past and history and we can only make it better by getting along and accepting that we are different because of genes not because of race. At the beginning we were all the same race.... so how is it different now... if we were all from Adam and Eve?|`|owRAguaNaa	it was never white. I take no offense.

For instance, Kenya is an East African nation, not a black nation.|`|jR6QWSfraa	no  was is ever white?|`|iy9xz6oNaa	Last time i checked it was red white and blue. I think a country should be known by the color of people that fight and die to defend it. that has always been mostly black, indian, etc the minority being white.  the past leaders of this country such as bush/cheney always seemed to be white with special treatment and deferments to war. i know cheney got 5 deferments and bush.. i am not sure but just google them its not me just saying it it is fact.  When a country proudly says " send me your poor etc" and open the borders to all then dont be surprised when one of their offspring believes the promises and actually becomes president.   that is not a bad thing that is a great thing. what america wrote on paper 200 years ago has finally came to its fruition.|`|flV8NKruaa	no.

I don't know when our calendar ends, I don't know how it was set up so there would be an 'end'.     Most people are just using this like they did 1/1/2000. The world will end, Christ will come, etc. depending on the beliefs of the person talking. A few, very few Christians are somehow putting this into the idea of the second Coming or something.     Otherwise, it will be an election year in the US, Olympics in London, a lot of earthquakes, tornadoes, maybe some hurricanes, etc. and people will be claiming it is the end.|`|bmCInR5qaa	Superstition breeds imbecilities.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	2010 is going to be the start of it.

Sometimes I can't answer half the recent questions posted in the Politics Section because I am blocked.

Oh yeah, I forgot, that's just gone.........|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Too bad obama is too weak minded to be able to quit....His example has made smoking the new "in." for young people.

Kidding of course.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	I don't care, cause I roll my own!  LOL  My weekly cost is about $7 a week.      Jason, you amaze me.  How would you suggest that the unemployed get health insurance?

Have you ever shopped for a policy for someone over 40 with a chronic condition?|`|i6d582PFaa	It's a good thing we don't legalize marijuana and tax the proceeds from that because after all dangerous drug gangs need money to buy their guns. bullets ain't cheap!|`|tvNkizDraa	I'm just as against it now as I was when it came up before and was vetoed by Bush.  In my opinion, the bill should have gone back to committee to consider different funding options.  Basically, if SCHIP is to be funded by a 'sin tax' then why not a tax on alcohol as well?  Or why not a tax similar to the property taxes collected for education?  Is it that the only tax increase the Republicans would consider for the funding was a tobacco tax increase?  That's what I remember from researching this bill over a year ago.       Since smokers are a diminishing tax base, I guess the tobacco companies should start advertising on TV and billboards again.  Maybe they could also resurrect their old marketing campaigns and handout free samples outside of school playgrounds... get those younguns hooked early so they can start paying for their own health care, right?  |`|TFdKrkP2aa	I'm happy to pay a few cents more for my cigs for all the good it will do.|`|704451020218089debe08f2c67892357aa	yep now HE has to pay an extra 60 cents per pack.  Oh wait a second......  immune to law.   He gets his for FREE!!!|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	I'm not even a smoker and I find it disgusting that taxes on tobacco keep rising to help insure people that don't have health insurance by choice.  I wonder what the government will do once the smokers revolt and stop buying cigarettes.|`|UAW6fd4baa	Fork Obama and his tax and spend policies! I guess that tells you I am not one of his supporters.|`|YZdTBWoCaa	He didn't go far enough ! Tobacco is the only thing for sale, that when used as intended, will kill ya ! He should make them illegal !|`|rKJQIaCdaa	I wouldn't have a problem with the tax honestly (i really need to quit smoking, and I have gradually cut down on how much i smoke as price has gone up)  IF  this money woudn't be squandered.   Our gov't spends tax dollars like there's no tomorrow.   The people I know that have the same wasteful spending habits as bush did and now obama have all gone bankrupt.    What I'd like to know is, how much of a pack is taxes now anyway?  They already cost twice as much as they did a few years ago.|`|Tue5oCljaa	Yeah, it's one way I guess.  Some of the smokers will end up costing us down line anyway...so a contribution from them is OK, and they can always quit.  That is tax you have choice about.|`|LnWOSedEaa	It's a democrat thing.  Their policies always result in higher taxes.  Don't be fooled by Obama. he doesn't pay for his coffin nails.  If people want to smoke, then smoke.  I'm not a smoker but don't support one particular groups of people having to pay for some type of govt. program that will fail anyway.  Look out for the marriage tax.  This country is getting pathetic.  I sure wish we could just start over lol.

f22c8eb9de6a4ecfdf3f913b536fba16aa	I'm actually an Independent, but I have a different view than others on the debt as it relates to these bail-outs.  We are in a crisis.  We cannot let the major lenders and the auto industry fail.  The result would be the loss of thousands of jobs (at least) in the states that are already suffering the greatest from the financial meltdown.  We cannot live in the past and look to find someone to blame.  It is essential we incur this debt and not let these industries fail because more Americans will be unable to buy homes and more Americans will be jobless.  This leads to the issue of socialist programs and I don't think we take an honest look at that. We already have a lot of socialist programs; Medicaid, Social Security, Unemployment Compensation; Veterans' Benefits; Medicare, AFDC; and Social Services--to name a few.  We often object to this bail-out on the grounds that it is socialist.  That, to me, is fine as long as it is not permanent and it is not.    The major issue that concerns me about the debt is the fact that we owe so much to the nation of China.  China is also suffering from the worldwide financial crisis.  Perhaps someone more intelligent than me can opine on what would happen if China calls this debt due.  I think it could devastate us.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Unfortunately    we have to borrow from other countries to LIFT the millions left behind by the Bush Administration and THEIR goal of destroying the middle class WHILE making their millionaire buddies into billionaires.    Economists agree    every dollar the GOV  spends (NOT tucks away into their friends savings accounts)  puts $1.50 into the economy.      As MOST people know, it takes money to make money, and the last 8 years has only been an exercise to put the money into the accounts of the rich.    when the Average American gets it he pays off the rich that he's borrowed from and he spends the money on "mostly" needed things    We all know where the $$$$ ends up      Back in the accounts of the rich that we pay off and buy things from    When the rich get handouts it goes into their savings   OR  it helps them in growing their portfolios with aquisitions|`|i5F2jwvhaa	" Clinton =no debt"    We were in debt the entire 8 years Clinton was in office|`|B6c7BeDnaa	clinton shuffled funds,didn't really reduce our debt.

Sadly too many americans were blinded by Obama's promise of hope and change to question or understand what that really meant.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Yes he does.    So in other words he wants you to take money you earned and give it to someone who does not make as much as you.    Sounds fair NOT.    Joe the plumber asked this of the token one during the campaign and all the media could do was rip Joe apart because they wanted the token on in office.|`|ISPIa0n5aa	why not?  that's the american way, isn't it?  drop out of junior high...have 10 kids with 10 men...get on welfare...and we pay for it all!!!!!!  i think they should make them get a job and make so much money before they can get on welfare.|`|fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	You confuse "wealth redistribution" with fairness.

They are trying making it seem like everyone gets a little something and that government is there to help you. This creates a much larger voting base when people think the government will give them something.   The goal of government is power...power comes from the people.   A big spending, taxing, re-distributing government goes against the principles of our Constitution.     In my opinion government is like a parasite.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Because delusional right-wingers who aren't wealthy are programed by anarcho-capitalists to think of money as wealth when in reality it isn't.  It is only a tangible representation of time and labor.  This way when the rich raise prices the delusioned and naive won't realize the wealth redistribution going up the ladder, and will cry about it only when someone attempts to reverse that trend to stabalize the economy so communism and socialism doesn't begin to look more favorable to the working class, an event that occurs when right-wingers tend to get their way far too long and exploit the working class until they are sick of it.    Wealth redistribution comes when the parasites that your type is always licking the boots of exploit the working class until they have bled them dry and keep trying to pinch them for everything they can get.  When the working class finally realize they are working for nothing opportunity is shrinking, and the upper classes do not want to pay them fairly for their time and labor, that is when several events may occur, among the most common:  -on a small scale localized to one company, a union may tke over the work place.  -on a a larger scale, the working class finds socialism or communism more favorable. they kick in the rich man's door drag him out into the street, drop a gasoline soaked tire over his head and set him on fire. His actual real wealth is then redistributed by the time he is finished screaming.  this is known as a communist revolution.    All the social programs you people keep crying and whining about, prevents the working class and the poor from viewing communism and socialism as more favorable. So you should stop looking at it as a burden and start looking at it as insurance on any wealth you may have and want to keep.    Not making any threats her, just pointing out the reality that you people like to ignore, that goes on in countries that don't have governments that protect the wealth and power of the rich and don't have social programs to help prevent communist revolutions.      And BTW if you think you get rich by working hard, you are the most delusional of all.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	You deliberately choose two very, very opposite subjects and project all your belief on that.  Why assume for instance that you are dealing with a hard working man?  Or even a man who did well for the company that hired him.  The man who nearly caused Home Depot to tank got millions and a new job at Chrysler, which seems to be headed in that direction too.  That new job of his also paid millions.  Now at the other end of the spectrum is the bane of Republican existence, the welfare whatever.  Truthfully most people who make minimum wage work two or even three jobs, jobs that don't involve sitting behind a desk in an air conditioned office with private bath and paid for country club memberships.  They can hardly be said to be lazy.  I don't understand the love Republicans have for giving hard working peoples money to the rich.  There isn't even a handy name for that.  Its like the wealthy celebrities who decide where to go based on the swag bags with thousands of dollars of watches and vacations, when they can easily afford those on their own.  Its not that Obama wants wealth distribution as he wants more of a level playing field.  Nothing wrong with that, I've been supporting the rich long enough.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Yes; this is very socialistic, and if you take a look at the other European countries who follow this economic model, you will find that they are not doing so well.  America (before Obama, and the recent mess caused by those in power who had no accountability) was a leading Nation because we chose to be different in how we handled our taxes, finances and economy in general.    If we redistribute the wealth to where everyone has a more equal salary...well, let's put it this way.  Who have you ever heard of, who got a job from a poor person?  Without the super wealthy, who is going to take risks and invest in the stock market?  The super wealthy drive the stock market, create corporations and other big businesses...which in turn, provide the rest of us with jobs, which in turn allows us to spend money on services and products and keep the economy flowing and moving forward.    I say we should stick to the original American Dream.  If you work hard, you get to make a lot of money, and in general, everyone has equal opportunity to go after whatever future they want.  Trying to create a Utopian society where everyone is the same or gets the same salary in a sense, doesn't work. If you don't want to be on welfare, get an education (which is free) and GET A JOB!!  Although some people may have more difficult life circumstances and obstacles to overcome, we still all have the same equal opportunity to obtain the life we want.  It's not fair that I have to share my hard earned money with the burger-flipper who decided to drop out of high school.|`|NIsRQR2caa	Following in the footsteps of Jesus.....uh, being a real Christian...uh, because the meek shall inherit the Earth...because he is compassionate....uh........doing what Jesus would do|`|9FI7zaKraa	was nobody listening to this man when he talked about spreading the wealth during the election? or just the opposite we now have a country full of free loading dummies..|`|dj8ofPtgaa	because he is a democrat and that is one of the common functions of that party.

Do you think it's right that just because someone was given no learning opportunities that they should be condemned to a life of poverty, working a 50 hour week just to keep their heads above water? He just wants people to get what they deserve. Right now there is a culture that breeds ***wipes like Paris Hilton who are just known for being rich having done nothing to get there, and it is a society that actually views being born rich as a viable life plan while people in America are dying on the streets, the majority not being to blame for their situation. People are going to continue to get rewards for working hard but hopefully all positions that require such effort will be rewarded.|`|Tue5oCljaa	Do you think it's right that these big corporations are cutting their jobs down to part time so they can drop the benefits and dump them back on the middle class when they have to go on assistance?  Putting it on the taxpayer....and then have people like you condemn them for it.  It's crazy that an employer is supposed to be responsible for health care in the first place.  Do you not get it, we already pay for people that are having a hard time....ALREADY and in the most expensive way usually.  I guess the middle class can continue to pick up the tab and let these rich guys keep increasing their bottom line...it's the American way.|`|DBIKou8faa	Wealth distribution is a way for the government to take what you have earned, give as much as they think is fair it to someone who hasn't earned it and they keep the difference.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	The ones who took all your money were Bush and his cronies.

Can they not read history books ?|`|SFnxkS3Raa	it's not wealth redistribution as in taking a hardworking guys money and giving it to some not so hard working guys..it's a matter of excess and balance....it's recognizing that there are lot of people who are "paid" a lot more than they should be just because they have been able to game the system to get the money....does a CEO produce 500 times more of the wealth than the people on the shop floor, or should the people on the shop floor be paid more for the wealth the company creates by their hard work?  Did Micheal Eisner really "earn" $500M a year at Disney?  Do Wall Street exes "earn" their $100M golden parachutes or $multi-million bonuses?  Most people would say no....and maybe that money ought to be paid to the people who actually created the wealth.  Should smart, clever, hardworking people running large companies or doctors be paid well for their talents?  you bet, but teachers, firefighters, police, nurses, etc. ought to be paid a lot more than they are, and that money should come from situations right now where some are "paid" more than they should be, more they earn.|`|i6d582PFaa	To make you poor of course!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Down with Obama!|`|QDFj9JPfaa	..."Barry" answered that question on National TV when he was interviewed by "Joe the Plumber"...

Please site when he said this. I'm willing to bet you probably saw some clip of Obama talking to Joe the Plumber or some other instance and Hannity or some other right wing pundit took a phrase out of context and cut Obama off, putting words into his mouth.

It takes the incentive away from the people that work hard.  You have higher unemployment because business will close down.  Why would someone want to have a business when he is limited as to how much he can earn before the government takes it away from him and give it to someone who does not work?  Eliminating taxes all together would be a much better way to do it.  You now have much more money moving thru the economy and the incentive to work is much higher and the incentive to own a business is much higher.  No need for big government that does not work anyway.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes.

wFmL5tWEaa	Executive Orders  originally were harmless and designed to order items needed around the White House (ie. paper, pens, pencils, ect.)Then,  early on in our history, Presidents began abusing these Executive Order Powers and began using Presidential Orders for items and laws they wanted to be passed that exceded their Constitutional Authority, and nobody had the testicular fortitude to tell the President NO Mr. President you cant do that .   Apparently some people believe it is actually considered politically incorrect to tell the President NO, so since it became a widely used practice of signing Executive Orders without anybody questioning those Executive Orders the Presidents got away with it.   If some large powerful groups like millions of people at one time actually began questioning the Constitutional Authority of Executive Orders of a sitting President again, this Unconstitutional Authority of a sitting President would cease and desist. But I am sure the Presidents would pitch a real ***** about it.|`|lEaT5q06aa	not sure, but i believe that the force of executive order comes through congress, by "acclamation" if they do not object,  for past 75 yrs or so exec-orders are required to be published, prior to that could have been secret    the line of authority for such is grey at best    emancipation proclamation is probably best known EO

Either way, you aren't making any sense...but for different reasons.  The people that make up a church pay taxes just like other people.

As far as I know most/all non-profit organizations pay no taxes. It's one of the perks they get for performing whatever public service they provide at a lower cost.|`|AA11622716	Your premise is incorrect.  Churches do indeed pay many taxes.  While there is some variation between states, churches are not wholly exempt from taxes.  In most states they pay property tax and such.  In general they do not pay income tax because they are structured as a non-profit and disgorge their profits each year.  Some churches are not non-profit and they pay income tax.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Just the way our laws are written. You may feel better to know that here, in Buffalo, NY, the churches are closing because of loss of church goers. They are consolidating many churches into one. When the catholic church that closed is no longer be used by the church, it then goes on the tax rolls. I do agree with you tho, that they should pay some sort of money for services they receive.|`|AA11424005	No, it is tax exempt status.  If you tax churches, would you tax all other entities that are tax free?  Tax free includes any not profit organization.  Governments don't pay taxes either.  If a state has an office building in a county, it does not pay real estate taxes to the county, the city or school district.

fP8H3n3baa	The New World Order was started in 1775-1785 by Adam Weishaupt. Here's a quote:  "..those individuals who are members of the Illuminati possess the 'Light of Lucifer'. As far as they are concerned, only members of the human race who possess the 'Light of Lucifer' are truly enlightened and capable of governing. Denouncing God, Weishaupt and his followers considered themselves to be the cream of the intelligentsia - the only people with the mental capacity, the knowledge, the insight and understanding necessary to govern the world and bring it peace. Their avowed purpose and goal was the establishment of a 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' - a New World Order, or One World Government."  http://www.redicecreations.com/specialre...    The Illuminati (not the one illustrated in movies and books) infiltrated freemasonry, started Skull and Bones (Yale), Krewe of Comus (New Orleans), Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove, and many pseudo-Christian as well as satan cults.    Novus Ordo Seclorum is on our dollar, by no coincidence.    The International Bankers started the group to make money by financing both sides of wars. They needed operatives to get that going, like the coupe that got us involved in Vietnam. They also financed writers and philosophers to create philosopies suited to what they needed, like Hegelism and Marxism.

More than half of the $700 billion in TARP funds approved last year have been distributed or earmarked.    Chief executives of companies with more than $10 billion in assets had an average compensation in 2007 of more than $11 million. Of that money, the average base pay was $844,229, well above the $500,000 figure announced today.    In addition to salary, chief executives also received an average cash bonus of more than $2.5 million, benefits and perquisites of $292,000 and average equity awards of almost $7.5 million, Equilar said.      At mid-sized institutions, those with assets between $1 billion and $9.9 billion, chief executives had an average base pay of $397,162 in 2007. But other compensation brought them to $858,754, still over today's limit. An average cash bonus added $134,717, benefits and perquisites added $115,201, and stock awards added $211,674.    Of the smallest group, those with assets of less than $1 billion, the average compensation was $384,000 in 2007. The average base pay was $247,135, cash bonus was $76,339, benefits and add-ons were $38,514, and stock was $22,023.    Today's cap does not apply to any of the companies that already have received federal money and would have no effect on the recently announced bonuses of more than $18 billion paid last year to Wall Street firms during the sharp economic downturn. Reports of those bonuses sparked the political outrage that led to the call in Congress to limit executive pay.    But the issue of executive compensation has been a flash point for years. Studies by an advocacy group showed that, in 2007, CEOs earned an average of $10.5 million, about 344 times an average worker's pay.        I,personally, as a stockholder (and taxpayer) wish there were some restrictions on executive pay. As someone who has a share in the company, I would much rather see millions be put back into the company then into one man's pocket. I'm sorry, NO ONE is worth that much cash. These guys have gotten away with it for years. The most famous being Ken Lay....who took all the accolades and huge bonuses from Enron but when it all came crumbling down..he pleaded ignorance. If your making millions of dollars a year...you don't get to plead ignorance.  These guys have gotten out of control. They already took the money I invested and lost it. Now they are dipping into my tax money too. If they want a bail out because they screwed up...then they have to take a hit too.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	President Obama's new rules are the most comprehensive effort, to date, to try to address this situation.  Of course they are not perfect but the idea is to bring attention to the situation.  Putting the spotlight on executive compensation can't hurt and it might encourage some companies to reconsider asking for government money.    Nevertheless, already some conservatives are labeling Obama's effort as socialism and communism and they are criticizing any kind of restrictions. Obama's restrictions are a mild approach to the problem and a sensible one.|`|CBx6qHztaa	And there are several loopholes with stock options and such that allow them to make more and withdraw it later on when things even out.

However, they may receive even more compensation through shares and benefits. It makes no sense and it won't help anything. It's like telling my employer he can only pay me 20/hour max when I'm getting paid 60/hour. My employer will then say ok and give me an equal amount of bonuses so that my lifestyle won't be affected by the rule.

And why would you assume only poor people object to the grossly inflated salaries of people taking my money to help their businesses?  I pay taxes, I never will see $500,000 on my W2.  If I give someone money I want to know where its being spent, and its not for new jets, new carpets or vacations in Scotland or Las Vegas.  Its supposed to be used to ease the credit logjam, not buy other companies.  So eventually they too will be 'too big to allow to fail" and need another bail out.  The idea of TARP isn't about punishing 'the man'.  Its about getting the US functioning again.  And its sure not about muli million dollar bonuses.    Since the money will only go to those accepting  TARP with the contractual understanding of the limits on executive pay there doesn't have to be a penalty thats specific to them.  It will be a contractual obligation, and be handled as usual throught the courts. No new laws will have to be written  And they do have to option of receiving stock options to compensate them in the future, but they can't take those options until the TARP loans are paid back.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I have lived in America my entire life.    I see what goes on around me.  I see my America.    Folks make at most $15 an hour.  Most make somewhere around $7 dollars an hour.  Mowing, sweeping, mopping, cleaning hotel rooms, laundry, washing golf carts.  I tried that it pays less than $.50 cents each.  Wash 47 carts get $20 bucks.  I washed 18 once.  I got nothing. wash all 47 or get nothing.  18 a day was my max.  People do not like bosses or CEOs.  They are out of touch.    Rick Wagoner makes $44 million dollars building one of the crappiest cars in the world.  I know Chrysler makes the worst vehicles.    We don't know what goes on in Detroit.  We don't know what suits do.  We know that crappy Cavalier has to get us to the hotel to clean rooms.  $200 bucks a week is not enough to buy a new car.  1990s cars are all I see around here.  Mine is a 1983.  Except the Real Estate pukes and their new Cadillac SUVs.  Everybody hates them. Salesmen are scum.  Like Vultures but worse.    I think bosses should be jailed if their company fails.  Not given billions for doing a crappy job.    You don't like Welfare because it pays people for doing nothing.  What the heck does a guy with a tie do?  I have never seen one working.
B07sKfdvaa	I have no idea what you are talking about, but liberals definitely have their wires crossed|`|PHpKo5hZaa	"Liberalism" is today the "in" trend, as the solution to dirty "conservatism."

If you have the money early it is better to pay it asap. Plus if you get it paid off in time before your court date then they shouldn't put you in jail as long as the check is valid and what I mean is it is your account or someone you know and it has a validated date on it.|`|1e3gBZY9aa	They won't put you in jail if pay your fines. I don't think they'd put you in jail for 10 bucks. They'd probably give you probation, becuase you have to pay for that too. They'd rather have your money than put you in jail.  Yes. you can pay if off sooner. That would make them real happy.|`|ImENOklEaa	loook buddy, this seems pretty bad, if they throw you in jail your screwed, those guyws in there will bend you over the shower stalls and ram you in the *** tilll you bleed to death, then they will rape you some more, pay the fine!!!|`|c0242fd69a2ad171c4352c31f37bfa26aa	why would you have to pay $500.00 for writing a $10.00 check was it your check if it was yours you would only be charged a fee. yes you could pay it off sooner it would be better|`|7VDzH4fBaa	When you were arrested and put in jail for a while, the police do not know if you will be sentenced to prison or not. Only the judge on the day of court decides that, not the local police...Do you have a lawyer? If so, ask them more about your situation. If you don't have one, then I'm pretty sure the fine and the check is all you need to do. Otherwise they would have been more clear that you're going to jail when they told you everything else. And personally, I can't see any jail time been given because of a bad check.

But like the above answerer said spend some of your capital until rates improve or take a bigger risk to get a potentially better return.

Governor Palin Releases Statement on Defenders of Wildlife Campaign    February 3, 2009, Juneau, Alaska  Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement today in response to attacks by the Defenders of Wildlife:    It is reprehensible and hypocritical that the Defenders of Wildlife would use Alaska and my administration as a fundraising tool to deceive Americans into parting with their hard-earned money.    The ad campaign by this extreme fringe group, as Alaskans have witnessed over the last several years, distorts the facts about Alaskas wildlife management programs. Alaskans depend on wildlife for food and cultural practices which cant be sustained when predators are allowed to decimate moose and caribou populations. Our predator control programs are scientific and successful at protecting vulnerable wildlife. These audacious fundraising attempts misrepresent what goes on in Alaska, and I encourage people to learn the facts about Alaskas positive record of managing wildlife for abundance.    Shame on the Defenders of Wildlife for twisting the truth in an effort to raise funds from innocent and hard-pressed Americans struggling with these rough economic times.    http://www.gov.state.ak.us/news.php?id=1...|`|VjRd9nb1aa	Mindless judd spews typical brainless hollywood banter, as do all her liberal buddies, to offset their boy's failures.

That's why they feel the need to attack her and try to render her ineffective in the political arena.  Palin has the kind of ideologies that people can relate to -- family, church and good moral values.  The wolf thing is a means of controlling the wolf population.  Otherwise, they would overrun the wild and kill out more deer, elk, moose, caribou, etc., than would be healthy for the ecosystem.|`|k6hicodfaa	I've had a hunting license since I was 13 and I think that shooting a wolf from a helicopter is cheating.|`|3fEiDkL3aa	Judds is simple minded and silly.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I dearly wish Palin would go away, that way I wouldn't have to see questions like " Why do Liberal fear Palin, they keep mentioning her".  I have nothing against hunting, hunters and/or guns.  As long as you eat what you kill.  Or you actually hunt.  In my mind using a plane, not tracking or following, but having a pilot tell you to aim and shoot, isn't hunting.  Its not a sport that way, there is no challenge, no outsmarting the animal, no actual hunt at all.  Just aim and shoot.  I don't think too many actual hunters would disagree with that either.  Maybe the ones that hunt like Cheney did would, in a fenced in park with game provided and a jeep so that you once again just aim and go back to base.  Thats not hunting, thats fishing in a barrel.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	I do not know all of the facts but I will say chasing animals in airplanes and/or helicopters until they are exhausted and then blowing them away and NOT eating the kill is something I frown upon.    You can't eat an animal that was scared to death due to the adrenalin that pumps through the meat. You could eat it but the taste and texture would be somewhat rancid.|`|XvovBRlnaa	Tell Sarah Palin to stop shooting wolves from a hellocopter.|`|f30193c2e64bfb6773ec2b22c8676713aa	To be frank, I really don't give a damn about Palin.

I personally don't think she's all that great, but she went ahead and is actually making a real effort in achieving her goals and being active in politics.  Any retard can start a website and make quotes to the media, especially when they fawn over Hollywood types and their meaningless opinions.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Does Judd buy meat derived from animals that have been slaughtered at a factory farm. Or, fish caught in nets?     Does she support politicians who eat meat and fish?    If so, she is a mindless, oblivious hypocrite.  Animals suffer in small cages or pens for months, then they are often dismembered alive at factory farms, when they are not successfully knocked unconscious first.     Fish are often raised so quickly from the depths of the ocean in nets that their eyes pop out.     Hence, if she eats meat or fish, she is sanctioning animal killings that are far more inhumane and painful, and she is part of the animal abuse problem.    http://www.wfad.org/about/treatment.htm    http://www.goveg.com/factoryFarming.asp|`|diWKJGUvaa	Palin and her ilk are the ones who should be hunted, I've always liked Ashley, now I respect her even more...

A corporate banker is likely to get at least $500,000 (yearly bonus) if they fail, which there is a very good chance of. When they fail several times they will get a much larger separation bonus, cash in their stock options, and retire to a multi-million dollar mansion (and/or get another job with another "Golden Parachute" - 'failure' at this level is no deterrent to being supported by the other 'good old boy' members of the board, you simply have to go to one of the other companies therein represented).|`|AAq8sVGLaa	a job application|`|bxlYleZkaa	One of then wears a better suit.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Bank robbers break the law.

If you had something new they would ask where and who you got that from. They would then go to that persons house and ask them if they gave that item to the other person.    I know in Nassau County NY had tried that, they found a lot of fraud and also found it payed to hire more inspectors. They were able to remove people that were scamming the system.    That is what they should do. And if they find people scamming then we should give them free room and board in a jail near them.|`|mg3DzHwFaa	I think testing is a great idea.

9tcv3TiWaa	It will depend on some factors.  Is he still in A School, unless he has more than 26 weeks left after you have been entered into DEERS you will not be able to live with him until he has completed it and gotten his first orders. Once he has the orders and if they are accompanied then you can be with him     If he is already finished school and with a command then it will depend on where the command is.  If it is an Overseas command and he is E3 and below you will not be going at all.  if he is E4 and above then you must undergo an Overseas Medical & dental screening, then the orders need to be changed to Command Sponsored and he has to be there at least 3 years after you come.  You will have to pay for the whole move yourself.      Now if he is on CONUS orders you can move there immediately.  It can take a little while before he will get BAH and there is usually a wait for housing.  So sometimes it might be better to stay behind, go through your things, get ready to move until everything is partially set up.  you will have to pay to move yourself and your belongings there.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	As long as you have a legal marriage certificate he can go to his Military Personnel Flight and get you enrolled in DEERS, TRICARE, and signed up for United Concordia, once your in DEERS you are official and a dependent and then he can apply for on base housing if it's available if not he can get BAH and find a place off the installation|`|qb9V9syNaa	you can move in immediately!  In a perfect world the paper work would be completed in a day.  They (the Navy) would have a place for you live immediately.  In the real world it just depends where he is stationed.  If he is on a ship that is out to sea.  More than likely you will have to wait until it returns, then you are put on a waiting list for housing.  So, you will have to wait a few weeks.  There are ways around it all though.  Some folks can move in right away other months later.  It just depends on too many factors.|`|224cm8qtaa	Once you are married can't you move with him whereever?|`|AA10709853	if he is already at his permanent duty station  you will have to pay for the move out of pocket.  If it is OCONUS and he is below E4 you cannot move at all.  if he is above E4 and OCONUS he must get command sponsorship for you.  that can take about six months.       if he is still in Training, his orders to his duty station must read accompanied.   if you get married too soon before he gets those orders he will have to report then request that they be changed to accompanied.   if you move before that happens, he will NOT be reimbursed for any expenses.  even these changes in orders can take 30 days or more.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Once you are married, you can move in right away. The only wait you may have to hold on, is when the military give you a place to stay, or you may be able to stay off post somewhere, depending on whether he is getting bah yet. All you will need to really worry about getting is a dependent ID card. At least that is what it is called in the army. Hope this helps.|`|UJbNNtxNaa	First off, congrats! and in reference to your question mam,  if he is already station somewhere CONUS (inside the 48 states)  the you should be able to initiate paperwork to give him off post/on post  housing, BAH, separate rations, and the  like. Depending on his command now, is when he can move you down there. Faster the pen, faster the move.|`|AA10506154	My husband is Air Force, and we were in Japan when we got married. He lived in a dorm on base and he asked the Housing Office about a week before we got married, how long he has to wait till we can move in together "Off Base"? They told him that if he's sure nothing is going to go wrong with our relationship, and that we are for sure getting married, he could have moved into a house off base 3 weeks ago. Air Force Housing told him that he could moved off base and we can move in one month before we got married. I don't know if Navy is the same, so just have him ask Housing.
AA11622716	You are probably being sued.  When you owe money, and the car is repo'd, and then sold at auction, if it doesn't sell for enough you still owe the rest.

If you want to marry her, it might help, but not as much as her being a good provider for her child.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	I don't think you should get married if neither of you think it is time. What I do think is, if he wants to do a custody battle, you and your gfriend should get some people together who know the baby's dad to testify against him. Also, what the guy has against him is he has never been there and never gave any money. In the state of Mississippi, if one parent doesn't have any contact with their child for a certain length of time, they automatically lose ALL parental rights. You might want to see if this law applies to your state. Get some advice from a lawyer. Consultation is free and he/she will tell you if that law holds true in your state as well. If it does, I'd go ahead and get married and then you adopt the baby and give the baby your name|`|AA10295984	Probably not. In my experience, courts are very wary of a new marriage. It is well known that people get married in order to try and trick the court, rather than doing what is best for the children. I suggest instead that both of you take a parenting class together. This shows commitment to the child. Your local health department can give you a list of such classes. Child Protective Services can give you a list as well.

The advantage of doing it that way is you don't have to prove 'beyond reasonable doubt' so it's easier to get. I'd suggest you let the police know and if possible make a detailed list with time and dates to give to them and they should help you decide what to do next.|`|9ed1e55228c6c8f8bca014e6699631dfaa	You sure can.

C5pVfdzwaa	It's like the guy who tried to get "Under God" taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance because he didn't want his daughter to be...  The court decided he couldn't sue for her because he had no personal stake in it.   You can't sue and win for someone else's suffering.  Even if your ex wanted to sue for himself, the doctor did provide him with the pills, but he has no case and no argument for not following orders.  In fact, the doctor might have been in trouble for abruptly stopping the medicine.  People sue because someone else is responsible for their losses, and you clearly understand that the responsibility lies with your ex.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	A civil action is based on -   a claim of wrongful conduct    committed by someone owing you a duty to care    That conduct was negligent - committed using a standard of care below that which could be expected of a reasonable person    The conduct caused harm which could/should have been foreseen.    What medication was he proscribed.  Dope is slang for heroin.  Please be specific.  Doctors sometime drugs which can be addictive - it's the sort of risk typically encountered, so simply proscribing it is not negligent.    "Why can "doctor's" get away with this."  You haven't said what "this" is - what did he do that was negligent?    "He's basically a legal drug dealer, that has ruined my life."  Umm, no - he proscribes the drugs based on his discretion.  Unless he also supplies, then he's not the drug dealer.  When you get crack on the street, it's all over the counter - that's different.  Also, since what he's doing is legal, he can't be charged with committing a crime, and you haven't shown what he did that fell below a standard of care.    "I would like to sue him, and then give all of the money to the children that have been affected by the doctor enabling addicts."  First off, you haven't excluded yourself from the group that enables addicts - just passed on the blame.    Second - winning damages in a civil case isn't like hitting Lotto - if you "win" anything, it's only to recompense you for your loss, not so you can dole out money to others, no matter how much they deserve it.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	No.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	You can sue anybody; winning, however, is another thing entirely.    Since this is your "ex" you're talking about and not a family member to whom you are related, I'd say your chances of winning are slim.|`|7fXuH1R3aa	No...it's your husband's fault that he got addicted.  Pain killers will not create an addiction until they are no longer needed, then a Habit is formed.  That means that your husband, eventually, acquired a mental need for the pills that eventually turned into a physical need.  I question how your husband got so many pills prescribed in one week.  Unless they were all different...I'm pretty sure you are not legally allowed to get refills that quickly.      Regardless...you have no lawsuit.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Go ahead and try but I'm thinking it would lead to a dead end, unfortunately there are attorneys out there that would probably take your case and your money...and you would come out with nothing in the end.|`|XoOanmdraa	no you dont...the person has to be invovled or the DA|`|S5H0NmEWaa	The doctor will have had to make a judgement about the best treatment for your ex-husband. Your ex-husband's own conduct as a result of the medication is his responsibility.     It is a pity that in this situation you seem to need to apportion blame and that you are blaming the doctor, whose role is really minimal. You may wish to think about who is actually directly responsible for the hurt that you have suffered; in many walks of life, nobody is responsible. Unfortunate things happen and circumstances can be damaging to us. I am sorry to hear that you have had such a difficult time but I think that you are possibly not dealing with it in the healthiest way.|`|AA10063059	no your husband has a mind of his own and unless he is sectioned under the mental health act then he was able to say no to this medication|`|iPH7k9XMaa	You can sue anybody for anything.  The real question is, would you win.  I don't know.  But aren't you (and your ex) better off helping your ex kick the habit instead of focusing on suing his doctor?   Instead of suing, you might consider talking to the police.  Over prescribing or prescribing unnecessary medicine is a real crime.  You'd probably need your ex's cooperation though.|`|3yrpDNavaa	Most states that I know of will recognize third party "emotional damage," so to speak, only when the relationship is spouse-spouse, parent-child, sibling-sibling, domestic partner-domestic partner.

3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Here is how it works.    When he is in AIT, the Army will look at where to assign him.    1.The first consideration is Units that have been notified of a deployment, they try to fill any empty slots those units have.    2. They fill empty slots in other units.    So depending on his mos and what units he can be assigned to, they will look at the Brigades that are about to deploy and see who needs someone right out of AIT.    Notice, they still have not looked at your Post assignment dream sheet yet.    Now if they decide, Post X and Post Y both need a MOS XYZ( your hubby )    Then they see your hubby ask for Post X, then they will assign him to Post X.    But if Post X and Y need someone, and your hubby ask for Post Z ,     Then he is going to Post X or Y anyway.

However, if say you husband was a 11B, right? and he selected a base like Fort Lewis or Fort Riley, where the demand is great because they just created two new units, and they need soldiers the supplement the ranks. Or he pick Some place overseas, like Korea or Hawaii? It pretty much depends on his job, the army's demand for his job occupation, and where they need them. If it happens to match up with your choices, then yep, you are good to go. But if they desperately need a 13F or a 19D (different jobs; scout and artillery observer) down in FT Hood, then in theory, they would reference his ASK (assignment satisfaction Key)  and see he wanted FT Hood. It Goes down to his branch manager, the guy in charge of all the people in his MOS. That guy gets orders for this many people, for this base, ect. Good Luck!!|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Well first of all, I would like to say thankyou for your support, we can use all that we can get. I am an MP in the army, I have been in for 4 and a half years. I used to live in Texas, my first duty station was Germany, I am now in Missouri at Fort Leonardwood. If you want a good place, I would say either Fort Hood, or Fort Bliss in Texas, you can't go wrong with Texas, or if you would like go for Germany, I loved it there, I actually havent heard anyone say they hated it, except for the long flights, going anywhere. LOL! The actual chance that you could get it lies on the army. Now your husband may be able to get choice of duty station, depending on whether he can talk with the recruiter and see if they can do that for him. I was lucky and got Germany as my first duty station, as it was my first choice for anywhere in the world. If you do go to Germany, when I was there, family housing was awesome. You couldnt do any better, the only problem with it was what floor you got, because they were like really huge apartment complexes. It was 4 floors. It sucked living on the 4th floor. Well in any case, I hope it helps. Just stick in there, it is hard being an Army wife. If you need any more help, or you have any other questions hit me up on here, I will be glad to help you out. My wife can answer questions as well if need be.|`|WpxhXXKMaa	Normally for initial entry soldiers, their first duty station falls under "the needs of the Army". Especially right now! It would be hard for them to give him what he ask for, when soldiers that have been deployed two or three times already, are denied their stations of choice. The three stations of choice are just a reference for his branch when their trying to decide where to send him after a hazardous duty or overseas assignment. And, he really won't find out where he is going until he is almost finish with his AIT.|`|G13RMlO4aa	I agree with VIVI but it's also crucial to get it in writing recruiters will tell you anything that's their job to recruit so get it in a binding contract|`|ABmZYbDZaa	There is one way to make sure you know where you're going to for the first is duty station of choice. To do that it's got to be in his contract and for first enlistments it's hard to come by anymore. more likely the Army will pick for you this time and t hen when he re-ups he will have a little more say at that time.

The AAR is a structured review process that allows training participants to discover for  themselves what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done better.    Four Parts of an AAR  1.

Determine how the task should be done differently the next time.

The devil is always in the details. Now, some places that pay commissions are packaged as a "draw." This means that you have a commission, but if you don't sale enough to meet say a quota, then you will receive a draw, which is usually slightly above minimum wage. Basically, you get either your commission or a set wage, whichever is greatest. Most car dealerships operate this way. Again, you'll need to read the terms of the contract. About quitting without notice, if you're in an "at will" state you have the right to quit at any time, with or without notice, and for any reason. Now, if you're contracted for a certain period of time, this can bring it into a new light. I would think that if you can prove you earned the commission you can get it. You may need to file a report with the wage & labor division in your state. Good luck!|`|CowgOqXTaa	If you had a written contract, then that governs, so long as what you were paid in total for the hours you worked did not average less than minimum wage.

You and a co-worker (hopefully one that can spell) can go to your employer and tell the employer what terms you want in your contract.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Some few unions pay their management a pretty darn good wage.  Most unions are small and the management gets no pay at all.  Of those big ones, getting someone qualified to run a big outfit competently means offering a reasonable wage.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Spoken like a true Republican  THAT  I'm sure enjoys his 5 day 40 hour work week  paid holidays  vacations  health benefits  safety on the job      ALL PROVIDED BY THE UNION|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Unions are for people too weak or too stupid to represent themselves    Why would any person with self respect pay for the right to work|`|k6hicodfaa	Are you in the anti-spelling union?|`|AA10124869	The notion that "Unions are what made this country great." ignores the simple fact that a Union is nothing more than a group of individuals working together towards a similar pursuit.    To infer that it was Unions that made this country great attempts (falsely mind you) that without this collective, the things achieved could not have been achieved on an individual basis.     But I digress...Unions were and are a breeding ground for mediocrity (clearly evident given the infinite recalls on American made automobiles for this, that, and the other thing). It removes any incentive by an individual to excel for the value for his productivity is only equal to the value of the least productive.

There are individuals who cannot be corrupted, but when you need a number of people to wield power, some of them will become corrupt.  What to do?    Establish controls, and do not forsake a benefit to your own interests, just because it sets up the possibility of corruption.  Instead, form the union to protect your rights, establish leverage and avoid becoming a low paid cog in a giant machine.   Then get active in the union and keep it from becoming corrupt, by voting in leaders who are dedicated to the rights of the worker AND the success of the employer.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	Some one, without even trying, is making a strong argument for education reform.

The current Government are not the ones reponsible for the financial condition of the country, which incidentaly the media blows way out of proportion.Labour has made great steps forward since the Tories. Under the Tories there was a huge shortage of books in schools, Tories raised mortagage rates to 15% then again to 17.5%, imagine what it would be like if your mortagage payments suddenly tripled, that's what the Tories did, that's what Labour repaired. Tories intruduced the Poll Tax, which taxed the poor more than the rich. Labour introduced minimum wage, we have an education system that's the envy of the world, Labour brought peace with the IRA resulting in London no longer getting bombed every Xmas time, Thatcher repeatedly threw people in prison simply for being Irish and in the wrong place at the wrong time. Labour has repaired the damage to industry the the Tories crippled in order to harm the Unions.    Since the Iraq war which was unavoidable, people have blasted Labour for everything and nothing.     Wise up.    Add.    I go on about the changes, SINCE the 1980's that the country is still benefiting from today. Something else I forgot among other things, is my Gran no longer has to borrow money from family members because her basic pension keeps her well now. I was too young at the time to go around shouting Thatcher out, but I was old enough to remember how hard it was for my parents. So by all means vote for some other monkey party and see all the benefits you take for granted being washed away.    So yeah, I keep the past in mind, otherwise how does anyone learn for the future.    That's good your parents were in work during that time, but I'm guessing they didn't work in the steel, shipping, or coal industries. Don't you remember all those massive strikes and protests, and the millions who did work in these industries being forced out of work? Very funny indeed.

Congress did mandate some banks to make these loans so they could make HUD appropriations of these loans.  Fannie/Freddy opened a market for securitization -- that is any bank could make a loan and turn around and sell it to fannie/freddy for a profit.  Because the loan was no longer on the books of the bank -- they could turn-around and make another loan -- which they'd likely securitize and make other loans.      Other banks, in an effort to compete w/ the subprime's, jumped on board.    So all banks weren't mandated.  But, at the time, the market was available to them.      If I can make a loan to a bum, turn-around and sell it for a profit and not have to worry about any of the consequences, I'd circle the blocks of every city I could and make the loans...especially if I'm trying to compete w/ those banks who were mandated to make the risky loans on the back of the U.S. Government entities -- Fannie/Freddy.    In reality -- consumers, banks, poor government policy, the dems and the repubs are to blame.      Consumers for being greedy and taking loans they knew they couldn't pay back    Banks for predatory lending knowing they could securitize the loan and not worry about the consequences    Poor government policy -- Community Reinvestment Act started by Carter and embrace by Clinton.      Repubs for not removing the CRA while in office -- Bush sr., bush jr....although G-dubs tried w/ the Republican Congress in 2001/2002 -- 2004, check below for who fought it.

Banks didn't walk into people's homes and hold guns to their head to make them take out these loans, so of which they knew that colldn't afford.

I noticed a few years ago in the city that I live that real estate schools were popping up all over the place. everybody was a part time real estate agent.  the tactics they used, overstating income, sub prime loans, finding a person with great credit and setting up the little phony real estate agency.    well, after they sold the property, they sold the loans to investment firms and got their money off the top.    this whole thing is about a few people being greedy, and now everybody else is paying for it.    it is not the banks fault, or politicians that wrote the law, just a few greedy people that wanted to make lots of money off of some desperate people that wanted to own a house|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	You're talking about the same crowd that blames guns for murders.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You mean minorities|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	They were under a lot of pressure from the CRA (thanks Clinton and Carter) to provide loans to people who couldn't qualify.

They know that once the legislation is passed, it will most likely never be repealed.  Could you imagine how demonized the person would be if they actually tried to get this repealed in the future?  They would be accused of wanting to see children without health care.  Besides, once all the children are covered by this, you can't just take it away because then all children would be left without insurance.  The insurance companies wouldn't be able to handle all of these children being added back onto insurance plans at once.

Reasonable minds can disagree as to whether any given level of regulation is appropriate, but the fact that government exerts control on many levels is hardly news.
9PAavWnyaa	I think it is inherently wrong. We have the same thing in Washington state. If a person, a U.S. citizen, who lives just across the border in Idaho and wants to attend Washington State University, they have to pay out-of-state tuition while the non-citizen gets the tuition break. Beats me, but why is it that when a person is elected to public office they have to relinquish their common-sense at the door?|`|kVTryKlBaa	Well if they can get free health care, while millions of citizens do not, then I guess we have found our 'change' now havent we?|`|sKmpJY85aa	The only right they should have is a right to a one-way ticket back to their own country..|`|dlm9GBrhaa	Only tax paying citizens should get the benefits of what our tax money pays for.|`|2Hlctljgaa	I'm mad as hell and can't believe the people of Colorado are not dragging the bone head politicians through the streets after they have been tarred and feathered.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	I don't think illegal immigrants should be allowed in our schools and state colleges at ANY tuition rate.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	i don't think they should be given those kinds of benefits being that they are illegals and all
HLHHM4Mtaa	For the most part those of us who knew something about politics are not the ones who sold ourselves out.  Those who did have gone back into their daily lives consisting of little more than the street culture of the day, a blissful state of ignorance, living on drugs and sex, looking for handouts, and not knowing or really caring what might happen tomorrow.  They will get their thousand bucks and might even pay part of a cell phone bill with anything left over from drug purchases, but what I protest most is the fact that with their ignorance they sold me out too.  ...and we all deserve better than street trash dictating our national fate.|`|IXxSiXHtaa	Wha?|`|91I5u8F9aa	that's the change you can count on.|`|s9WG4NaPaa	women do that even for less|`|ujIinLzGaa	Not me.|`|5Ho518J9aa	40, These sheep aren't even paying attention enough to be able to answer a simple question.

Assuming that there is a basis to your question, I suppose you would have to ask her.  I know several people that have given up a license to practice (or at least gone to inactive status).  The usual reason is that one is not practicing law in the state any more and maintaining a license costs money -- both in fees to the bar and in the requirement of continuing education and reporting.|`|2Hlctljgaa	More money in Hospital administration and far less work and stress.|`|N5pPJUS8aa	Could you please state your source?|`|avWArdYbaa	Is this really important?

CM1dfztQaa	Of course it does. The government is handing everything to these people and then acting surprised that we're going broke. That's a huge part of the reason that CA is broke and that CA residents aren't getting their income tax checks.     CA has to take the money that hard working AMERICAN citizens have earned to pay back what was handed to people who don't legally belong here, and who are sending the money they make to support Mexico's economy. If these people want to be here they should apply for citizenship.    By the way, do you really think that it's only Mexicans coming across the Mexican border?...    Sorry, started to get on my soap box again.|`|WgruZkHRaa	Help our people last is our governments motto. How can we have poverty, and give hundreds of millions to other country's.

But by looking at your avitar name, I can see that being taken seriously is not your objective.    Grow up.|`|gE03TUtQaa	I am not surprised.

Besides the law states paying for LEGAL immigrants not illegal.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	no, not mostly.  but we do help out those that our laws don't currently protect.  "illegal" is just a legal label that is long overdue in being changed, both Republicans and Democrats agree, "comprehensive immigration reform" is needed.  Our country would cease to function if people like you got what you think you want "deport them all".  there would be no maid service in hotels, there would be no one working in the meat packing industry, corn industries, a huge portion of our food is brought to us by so called "illegals".  most of these people pay taxes.  so watch your mouth and have some respect.

The bank were mandated to make the sub prime loans by Federal judges and acts of congress. One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.|`|bc1202e9aa15ed85d573b1219c69b9cdaa	How is the number of automobiles connected to that silly statement?|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	according to plan , yes he realizes it|`|6wSmZrrsaa	STFU that report did not include Americas service vehicles like it did china.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	China has a BILLION people... and most have never owned cars.

But you do realize that means no qualified executive will agree to stay on and/or work for those banks, right? Which means they will likely fail, and all that bailout money will have been for naught?    Ask yourself - why would you agree to work for $500,000 when you could double or triple that just by changing jobs?     (There are plenty of other places for them to go - both in America and overseas.  If nothing else they will sign on to smaller banks, who didn't take TARP funds, and grow those banks into new superbanks.  )    The market is perfectly capable at defining success and failure, if we would just let it.    (They should have been allowed to fail outright, but they wanted to steal our money first.)    Phil M - you're just wrong, unless you're including all small businesses in your number.   But if you think the guy who owns 4 car washes should make the same as a guy responsible for over a million jobs and trillions of dollars...well, then, I suppose the guy at the car wash can run the economy in your world, but I'd just as soon not have it happen in mine.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	All the more reason to oppose it...|`|PDYdcSliaa	I think that any institution that receives bail out money should indeed have salary caps on the people whose decisions put them in the dire straights they're in now.

Unions were originally formed because of poor and dangerous working conditions in factories and poor wages, etc.  Unions helped put into place standards of working conditions that forced "big" corps. to make their work places safe...  They have now "outlived" their usefulness, in my opinion, because of stricter government regulations in the work force now, and because of past corruption in some unions.  Since our government is not "technically" an "industry"..it can't, and shouldn't allow unionization.  All, IMHO of course...|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	You know what hampers progress? Congress.

The president should not have a say over which contracts private coorporations enter in to nor should the president be able to put restrictions on such contracts.

You should check this out,  www.bound4life.com    That thinking should definitely apply over not only partial birth abortion, but any type of abortion!

ffe0db61cd17d7ebf59d46366ecf3f7caa	The Republican connection to the religious right is the answer you are looking for.  They are just about as radical as Muslim terrorists in the way that they abandon their beliefs when it conflicts with their goal.  Take for instance, the Focus on the Family farce.  They spent millions in California trying to get the gay rights bill overturned.  The funny thing is that they then had to lay off a lot of people (right before Christmas no less!!) because they overspent on the gay issue.  My point is that for a group that supposedly focuses on the FAMILY, they ruined a whole lot of family's Christmas and possibly year by firing their employees.  Was the overturned law in California really worth that?  So naturally, when a group is attacked like that, they aren't going to join that group.  Democrats are far more liberal (obviously) and open to equality.  Do you think it was Republicans who pushed through women's rights? Or racial equality rights?  And before anyone tries to throw Lincoln into this, yes, he was a Republican, but if you study history, his Republican party had the same ideals of the current Democratic party.  The two parties have changed considerably over the years.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	Because birds of a feather flock together.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	because liberals are gay, they just don't know it|`|bc5jGZ0uaa	Because it is often the social views that make the political party- not entirely but it is a huge part of it.

e4fdad2a4b8172efe8cf20fd51951036aa	You are asking the wrong question.    The meat industry isn't saving money because it is hiring immigrant workers, it is saving money because it is violating federal and state wage and hour laws.    The federal law that requires payment of the federal minimum wage and the payment of overtime wages when you work more than 40 hours in a week has been determined to apply to every worker regardless of his or her immigration status.  Employers cannot legally pay a worker less than the federal law - called the Fair Labor Standards Act - requires.  Period.    So if the Department of Labor had the resources to monitor and actively enforce the FLSA on the meat industry and many other industries, so that the employers knew that they had to comply, it is possible that this would increase meat prices somewhat.  But it would help the economy by making the corporations pay workers according to the law, so that the workers had what they needed to take care of themselves and their families.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Back in the 1970's, 30+ years ago, meat packers made $20 an hour and had great benefits.  They were all Americans and the rest of America could afford to eat meat.    Today the industry is full of illegal alien labor, the jobs pay less than $10 an hour and there are very few benefits.    You are correct.  If all the illegals disappeared tomorrow, and they had to hire Americans at $20+ an hour the increase in the cost of meat would be minor.|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	Prices really wouldn't have to go up. They could raise the pay, but keep prices the same. The companies would have a little less profit.  Actually meat prices raised substantially while illegals were working in the packing plants, so that reasoning of significantly raising prices because of pay increases, seems kind of lame.    Look at oil. The price of oil is way down, so gas prices went down.  Then they companies didn't like getting only $30 million profit so they started raising gas prices again. Does a company really need that much profit.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Prices may raise some but it would be well worth it with all the savings from no longer having to support illegals and their anchor babies.|`|CpTQagJOaa	I'd be willing to pay more for meat or not eat meat at all in order to get rid of all the illegals.|`|VyLXMBtcaa	They been using it for veggies too.

sIvUjRT3aa	The Democrats only see one thing.  They see that the hispanic population is growing by leaps and bounds over any other race.  Most of that hispanic population are one to 4 generations removed from Mexico.  They also see that 12-20-??? million illegal aliens that are already here.  All of this boils down to one thing.     If the Democrats give the illegal aliens amnesty, those aliens will then vote Democrat upon getting that citizenship(if they even wait for that). With a monolithic black voting bloc and the hispanic voting bloc, they can effectively wipe out the GOP and we have a one party system in which they can advance their idealogical and liberal agenda to whatever their dreams can imagine.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I definitely don't think that the Mexican government should be trusted and a harder stance needs to be taken to get them to straighten up down there.  They are all corrupt, daily life is bordering on chaos and they seem uninterested in doing anything about it.    I'm not for the amnesty bill.  I think that if they give them license to break the law then we should all be given the opportunity to do so.  Since they are here, at least make them pay for what they did.    But, if they are going to work over here illegally let's make them legal so that they pay taxes like the rest of us.  We have a lot of stuff to pay for.|`|lr74sHPLaa	they only want to give illegals amnesty so that they can give them the right to vote so dumbocrats and Uhhbama can stay in office.|`|Oct9Pv9Jaa	We trusted the Republicans under the Idiot Bush and where did it get us??|`|qZ1wEDPpaa	NUMBER ONE F u ck UP in this country..

ipWRgKetaa	Interesting, isn't it. It speaks to the priority and the importance that the Obama administration places on our intelligence community. Specifically, it is a VERY low priority. The war on terror is an 'intelligence' war. We need to have our very best and most experienced people in key positions. The economy, which will recover on its own and despite anything Barry does, is a far second compared to the requirements of the intelligence community and national security.

I think not!    Secondly, do we really want a government agency that works in secret, without Congressional (or any other) supervision?  Why would we believe that these people are serving the interest of the American people, which includes following the Constitution?  Do you trust them?    I want transparent government.  I want to know what our elected and appointed public servants are up to.  Since the work for you and me, we cannot allow them to work in the dark.      Many people believe that we need secret operatives to deal with our "enemies".  I contend that it is because of the activities of these operatives, and the actions of our foreign policy advisers that we have enemies.      There are plenty of criminal regimes in the world run by gangster politicians, but they are not going to bother us as long as we have a powerful military to deal with them, and stay out of their affairs.

The interview is to convince the immigration officer that the two of you are actually married because you love each other, rather than to gain immigration benefits.    Google "Stokes interview" for reports from other people.|`|Ac6iEjDtaa	Yes, that's mostly the same questions you had before you got the visa.    Questions about the marriage if you are interested in obtaining U.S. citizenship. That is, INS officers conducting naturalization interviews often like to inquire into the status of the underlying marriage. Citizenship applicants in such cases should be ready to provide detailed explanations, if not also documentation, to convince the interviewing officer that their marriage was entered into in good faith.
NkEHCHsOaa	This guy knows his stuff. Even the liberal economists are agreeing that most of this will have a horrifically negative effect on the economy. The only people it will help are democrats in office to consolidate their power base. I don't see how that could be a good think unless someone is in a cult like state and will support democrats completely without any thought as to the effects they will bring down on us with their crazy irresponsible mess of so called governance.     The democrats have been more like the Mob busting out a business to strip all the profits they can out of it, and then walk away as it crumbles, towards our country, than a legitimate government.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	First, I have to admit that I was unfamiliar with Hunter.  So I've spent the last half hour learning about him.  Very impressive!  Where has he been all of my life?    To answer your question, No, I don't think that Hunter and Steele would make a good combo.  Hunter is pro-life but Steele is more moderate.  Hunter supports capital punishment and Steele opposes it.  Hunter opposes affirmative action but Steele strongly supports it.    Hunter is fiscally and socially conservative so I wouldn't pair him with any moderate (like Steele).  His views mesh very well with other conservatives like Jindal and Huckabee.    I would support a Hunter/Jindal or Hunter/Huckabee ticket though.|`|2605b0d5c472ab7e8f2f41afd93eaf3aaa	Forget it, if the economy is still bad in 2012, the election will be won by a republican governor who has nothing wrong with him.|`|2f2A2Lz3aa	That's okay , but I like Steele/Palin or Steele/Jindal !|`|7y6yfrQlaa	I'm all for it; with a n.e.g.r.o on the republican ticket, they will lose the South for sure. their precious "Southern Strategy" can't help them there|`|cPPBGiYgaa	I am all for Steele, but not for Hunter. I don't know much about him, but for some reason he seemed like a carbon-copy of Huckabee to me. If conservatives want to be competitive in future elections, the last thing they need is a predominately evangelical christian/former pastor in a candidate(I'm referring to Huckabee).    That being said, I don't think Palin should run either. I can tell she is gearing up to run because I have seen her on TV more and more, and even before the SuperBowl I saw her on NBC. It seems like she is trying to get that exposure. Personally, I like her, but I do not think she could deliver a victory for Republicans.    The best team would be a Steele/Romney, or Steele/Jindal. Jindal would make a great President IMO. I wish Swarzenegger could run. McCain may have even won the election if he appointed Jindal.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	I had to wiki him, but a rare breed, a Republican Californian...  I knew they were out there but idiots like Pelosi and Waters upstage them.   Whoever it is, it better just be the winning ticket.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	Who ever pushes the fair tax is who I'll vote for.

However, I would like to see a dark horse come out of no where, like:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McClint...    But it probably won't happen.  That being said, I like conservatives that are both social and fiscally conservative.  So there are quite a few names to choose from.    Sanford-Thune-Pawlenty, etc.    But yeah, I'd vote Hunter/Steele
S2aHg67yaa	Well done. I'm proud of you. Notice how the only one against it doesn't give any reasons why? Also, the Netherlands hasn't had any negative overall effects on the economy from legalizing weed.|`|g54tGcRvaa	It should be legislated similarly to alcohol.  Only for adults, and stiff penalties for driving under the influence (even if you *think* it makes you a better driver).  They can even tax it to help the federal budget.  It's not an evil thing.|`|ulzWumWPaa	It would be no more 'beneficial' than tobacco is, but at least like tobacco, it would be producing LEAGAL revenue for farmers and taxes on the products. Plus the stuff was really for making fabrics similar to cotton until the smoking of it got so out of hand. Ever heard the term 'hemp rope' for instance? Yep, made outa pot.   http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-hemp.htm    http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/609...      Also there's medicinal use of it.  http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/ongoing/marinol...

It will bring up a whole other cornucopia of stores, employment, and businesses to boost our economy.          I think that weed should be legal, but only allowed to be smoked in certain licensed buildings. like have a business with a building filled with a whole bunch of fun stuff and allow weed to be smoked there but the people there can't leave until their high wears off. This will allow people to get high and have a good high while not being a threat to modern society.  The legalization of weed will bring nothing but good.|`|z7hWblT7aa	no I don't agree|`|e76ca3a8a4fb4c384fdfa09fb1fd8582aa	You can't tell if someone is operating under the influence of weed. I have been told that I am a better driver when I drive high actually. My dad had no Idea I was high. Anyway I think that the government would benefit from it, and the public would too.|`|KXfGa4Quaa	i agree. weed is a plant and god put it here for a reason. it also helps medically, and mentally.     my mom has smoked since she was 12 (she's 46 now) and she is doing great in life. honestly i look up to her and pot has never ruined anything for her.

A lot of it is crap that doesn't make much sense to me, but when you get into the innards of a bill like this it can get misleading.  Many people are instead just taking a politician or journalist (or whatever you call Rush) at their word.      I don't think you can actually judge a bill for yourself unless you read it.  However, my job prohibits me from having the time to read every bit of legislation, that's why I elect representatives to do it for me.  I may have voted for Obama and yes I believe we need to do something, but I never trust any politician and there will continue to follow up on the progress of this and other major bills.

The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country.

RkfIPD7Iaa	A right is whatever society has deemed to be due to a certain class of society member, usually every member in modern, 'western' societies.    Rights vary depending on the priorities of the society.  Nothing is set in stone as an inalienable right in all societies.  Most would consider the right to some form of housing to be a right.  But that right is not all encompassing.  In a capitalist society, a right to equal opportunity supersedes any all encompassing right.  So we might say that everyone has the right to housing PROVIDED they are willing to pay for it, and are willing to abide by reasonable rules and behavior.  Most would consider education, at least to a certain level, to be a right.      The right to equal opportunity in employment is usually defined as a right as well, but that does NOT mean that an employee is granted a right to a job without limit.  They would, for instance, only have a right to have an equal chance at any AVAILABLE job.  They must maintain standards of performance and behaviour, and can lose that 'right' if they contravene those.    Healthcare is considered a right granted to all in most western societies, with one glaring exception, of course.  In the US, it's considered a right only if you are willing to pay for it.|`|AA11206283	None of these things are included in the "Bill of rights"    Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|`|lEaT5q06aa	you have a right to do what you are able to do  and then to suffer the consequences of your actions  you have the same rights as a housefly or bacterium    what americans call "rights" are privileges that they assume that their government protects, provided they do not have the "rights" taken away by due process of law    might american "rights" be extended to include a hammock and poolside drinks    it might    but it is a monstrous mistake|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	No, none of them are rights.    If it has to be given to you by somebody else, then it's not a right. A right is something intrinsic, something that you have because you exist and live in a place that recognizes that right.    If somebody else has to do it for you, it's not a right.|`|SSLekPAnaa	None of them are. They are privileges.    Health care: Buying health care insurance is a bill, like power or water. You must adjust your budget to pay this. Why should anyone else pay for you?  Education: The public school system is a absolute failure. Statistics prove privately funded education is much better. Eliminate the public schools and go to purely private funded. Why should I pay for anyone elses education? It does me nothing.  Housing: Why should I pay for anything that I will never use or see? People need to find their own housing by using their own income.  Employment: If you want to work, there are plenty of jobs available. Go out and find them.    The only freedom is choice. You then deal with the consequences.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	None of those are rights.    A right is a freedom of action or a protection against government force.    A right does not require the taking of money from another person, or of forcing another person to do work on your behalf.|`|SS1VReF0aa	No, not if we are talking about basic legal rights as outlined in the Bill of Rights    Freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition  Right to keep and bear arms  Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures  Right to due process of law, freedom from self-incrimination, double jeopardy  Rights of accused persons, e.g., right to a speedy and public trial  Right of trial by jury in civil cases  Freedom from excessive bail, cruel and unusual punishments    Everything you listed must be earned as they all have value.

Notice everything in the bill of rights are also things that people want, but they don't cost money to provide.  If it costs money, someone else must work to provide it.  A right is something that someone should naturally be entitled to because it respects that person's existence, they are not "the things we would otherwise want to be free".|`|D5A9JUDMaa	If these things are "rights".....    shouldn't the government be providing them for "free"?

A right is basically something to which you have a legitimate claim and that can include something considered a privilege.  If the government passes a law allowing a new demographic to participate in the political process through a voting rights act, then those people now enjoy the right to vote, even though the vote has to be "given" by another person or entity.     Similarly, if the government passes laws creating rights to healthcare, education, housing, or employment, then we would have rights to those things.    You conceive of "actual rights" as being only those rights considered "natural," but there are legal rights as well.    EDIT: The answers might have been more on target if you had specified that you were referring only to Rand's definition of natural rights.|`|mfYfeFCgaa	very well said, I couldn't have put it any better

The press is the only business that is protected in our constitution.  They are dialect in their duty for being pretty much a mouthpiece for government.    Journalism should be extremely hard on government, calling everyone involved on the carpet and stop asking soft ball questions.      That means not being a government puppet and allowing us to get into phuked up wars, economic messes that were destined to happen, exposing those who control our money, who benefits from our wars, health system, insurance companies, and how all of that has crept into our government way of doing business.    Then again, what would you expect when the media is owned pretty much by 5 media giants.

xxDjV6Axaa	It is true that the insurgents have been dispersed in most of the area.  Most of the country now has electricity.  Schools have been built.  The news just doesn't report the good things we have done there.    I worked with the guy who set up the Iraqi Air Force.  They have these old planes that are falling apart yet they had incredible courage in learning how to fly them.  He came back with such admiration for their determination.  And they were so grateful for our help.      Don't listen to CNN even though that is the channel that most military plasmas are tuned to.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Recent reports on the "calm" in Iraq attribute the relative peace to the migration of foreign fighters from Iraq to Afghanistan to join forces with the Taliban.    As argued many times here in YA - the battle with "terrorists" is not over a specific piece of land or for a specific time period.  Yesterday Iraq, today Afghanistan, perhaps tomorrow Kashmir.      If you think we "won" in any of these locations you are buying fool's gold.  The war is in the second inning, not the ninth.  If you think Iraq is over, you don't understand the game.    EDIT to WO DoubleL:  I went to you link and found the following:    -While Arabs love to call Israelis "Nazis", it is the Arab world that is the true heir to the Adolph Hitler's vision of how the world should be.    This is not my idea of "just the facts."  In fact, it betrays the site as just another deceitful smear opinion site, with an agenda.  Nice try.|`|6ad710b1b3d9318af1b579f1f46ac105aa	My take is that the fighting on the ground in Iraq has slowed because Obama is sympathetic toward the muslim world. My guess is that the insurgents will take something of a wait and see approach, and then when Obama lets his guard down and withdraws the troops the insurgents will mount what amounts to the battle of the bulge for control of the county. Same thing with Afghanistan. That's my opinion.|`|yffVmSMaaa	Per the people I personally know that are over there, there's as much (and as little) fighting as there's been for a while now - And it's not going to change much.

Eight years ago, the public debt stood at 5 Trillion dollars. At the end of the Bush era, it was 12 Trillion - more than double. And now it is set to go to between 13 and 15 Trillion.

One trillion seconds of ordinary clock time = 31,546 years.      So, spending at $1 a second, it would take 31,546 years to spend $1 trillion.

The bank were mandated to make the sub prime loans by Federal judges and acts of congress. One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.|`|aV3bFchtaa	It will be another positive step in the direction of driving the country into a dumbed down third world nation.
bFLP6COgaa	When spending is taxed, people who are making just enough to get by spend a greater percentage of their income on sales taxes than someone who makes more money and can afford to save.    For a simple example, consider a government with a 5% sales tax on all goods. If someone making minimum wage has to spend their entire paycheck just to get by, their effective tax rate is 5% of their income. Contrast this with someone making more money, who can afford to put half their income into savings. That person's effective tax rate is 2.5%, because the half of their income they are not spending isn't getting taxed.    The effect of this is that poor people pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes than rich people, which is the definition of a regressive tax.|`|xACwWEXHaa	"Regressive" means that those least able to afford them are most affected by them.    If I buy an item with a 10% sales tax, I pay 10% more than I would without it.  If I have loads of money and loads of discretionary purchases, then I'm not "squeezed" too much.  However, if I am poor and already pay out almost every dime I earn for housing, food, and transportation, any additional taxes on what I must buy to survive is going to cause me to be able to purchase that much less.  I "regress" in what I can purchase to make up for the increased cost of the item caused by the tax.    We have "progressive" income tax in the US, and have since about the beginning of the 20th Century.  The less you earn, the lower the proportional sales tax you pay.  In fact, if you get below a minimum in income, you pay no income tax on it at all.  There is also a maximum tax rate.  If I make more than about $350,000 as a single person,  I will pay the maximum tax, but I pay that same tax rate if I earn a gazillion dollars in a year.|`|AA11312653	For the sake of discussion, let's say that the basic necessities of life cost the typical American $20K per year. Let's also suppose the sales tax is 2%.    A person who earns $20K a year must spend 100% of her income on necessities. So 2.00% of her total yearly income goes for this tax.    Let's contrast that with a person earns $100K a year, spending $40K and saving $60K. Her tax bill for the year will be 2% of $40K, which comes to $800. Do the math and we see that only 0.08% of this person's yearly income goes for the tax. So, in comparison to income, the poorer person is taxed at a rate 2.5 times greater than the better off person.     If we do the math for a person who earns $1M per year, even if that person spends (and so is taxed on) $500K, the yearly tax bill is still only 0.01% of her income. The person earning $100K pays 8 times as large a proportion of her income in taxes as does the lavishly spending millionaire, and the working poor person pays 200 times as much, proportional to income. That is what "regressive tax" means, a tax that is most burdensome to those least able to shoulder the burden.     But please someone double check my math here. Even if I didn't get the math perfect, it's easy to see from this example how a sales tax hits the poor much harder than it hits the rich.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Because poor people have to pay them.|`|e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	They're not, unless you're a greedy Marxist / Socialist.

If you earn $1000.00/month you pay an 8% sales tax on a pack of toilet paper. The person who is making $2000/month is paying the same 8%. The person who is earning less is paying a higher percentage of their total income in taxes than the other person. If there was no sales tax, but a flat rate income tax, then everyone would  pay the same percentage of tax on what they earn, not what they buy.
Re9Pdfxbaa	John Prescott was elected on the back of the Trade unions and when in power he stuffed the lot. I remember when the Fire Fighters were on strike a few years ago he was a minister or deputy prime minister , he said to the Fire Fighters I quote: "GET BACK TO WORK THERE'S NO MORE MONEY" !!!! This from a politician who voted himself a cast iron huge pension and a huge pay rise and who has several houses worth millions of pounds. He is a hypocrite of the worst level. Whenever he appears on radio or TV I switch off.  He values fluster and bluff ???|`|004191770d52d2dff11de585b12631dcaa	A Labour value? no i pass on that!!|`|Aah86hEmaa	John Prescott who ever took any notice of that buffoon?

Answers closely I'll admit, but I guess my critique of your theory would be that you really haven't put much effort into differentiating what is happening now from what would have happened had Obama not been elected.    You're probably WAY smarter about things like this because I am not involved in human resources consulting at all, but I guess I would be more convinced if you explained how these layoffs would have been avoided if only Obama had lost the election.    My "layman" opinion of the situation is that this economic problem was several years in the making and that the negative results we're experiencing today would have occurred regardless of who won the last election and that tax cuts kind of helped us to be where we are now.    But like I said...I'm no human resources consultant!|`|YYbVDcw8aa	You do realize it takes a bit of time for any person or business to "react" to the changing political climate?  And it sounds a lot like every time the  Republicans have had a go for a while.

I think you may want to consider this as the end result of the previous Failed! administration.

Back in November, there was much discussion about job loss. No one believed it.    And guess what people. It isn't over yet. Not by a country mile. My company is planning on letting another 10-15% of our workforce go, due to planned tax increases and the slumping economy. We have already outsourced a lot of work overseas where there is less government regulation.    These are the facts of today's businesses. Either you play by the rules, or you don't. If you don't, there is no game to play.

The expansion of the childrens health care to families up to $68K is to help the people losing their jobs-how many unemployed people make $68K?  The CBO said it will take no quitters and we need to add 22 million more smokers for the tax increase on cigarettes to pay for this expansion.  HR6 to require registration of any handgun or long gun (including shotguns) that take a removable clip with a capacity of 12 rounds or more or "that can be modified to do so" (which would be every clip fed weapon made including my Ruger 10/22 rifle) because they are assault weapons and used in crime has what to do with the economy and how any crimes are done with semi automatic rifles?  They did hold the registration fee down to $25 per weapon in the bill but after it is in force the fee will be set by the AttyGeneral so figure out what it will go too since the AG does not believe the 2nd Amendment applies to the citizens and has said he disagrees with people who think the Holder ruling said that-he does not think that was the ruling though almost all pro and anti plus neutral judical experts said it did?  So can't ban them you just make it so expensive no one can afford one.  The extreme left is way out of control and is not speaking or representing the great majority of Americans so they will either strip the President of his support from the moderates or ignore all other voices and ram whatever they want through Congress and the President will sign what ever they send because he was part of the extreme left in Congress and through ut his political career.|`|tBSChaT9aa	it is already doing so and this is no stimulus it is a PORK fest made by the CON-gress|`|5Ma2ovxjaa	With obama aligning himself help with Pelosi, it does say something about his character.

Chris Wallace corrected her, stating she probably meant 500,000 jobs. Pelosi responded in her own defense, It feels like 500 million.

At this crucial juncture in the push to pass an economic recovery package, President Obama finds himself in the most unlikely of places: He is losing the message war.

And I'm all for it. THAT is how it used to be done and how it should be done. Faith and community based efforts should be the 'safety net', not the government. In many places, particularly in the south, such programs have been a part of societies for pretty much 'ever'. My little brother and his wife relied heavily on a faith based program when he lost his job during Clinton's last recession. Didn't take a dime of government money. But now that he has a new job, he's contributing back to the program to help others. THAT is how a society should work. Faith and community involvement, not government involvement.|`|tvNkizDraa	First of all... my views are liberal, but that does not make me a socialist.

"Obama spoke of how faith has often been a divisive tool, responsible for war and prejudice."    So faith is not his main motivation and the very sentence is perfectly said ... religion has only one purpose, it divides people based on different beliefs ... religion in the 21st century is such a shame!!
q1GnMRxxaa	Of course not. We here it daily about Bush and his so called war crimes that he did not commit. Now Obama has been president for a few weeks, and he can't even pick people for his cabinet that aren't crooks. Gee, and this is going to continue for 4 years. This will be a very entertaining 4 years. Like I have said before, It is all about revenge from the republicans getting Clinton impeached.

What ever you may think about Carole Thatcher is really not in question, what is that she made a remark during a conversation in private using the G-word. I wonder how many people on this site have used words in private amongst their friends which in public may have been offencive.  Had Carole used the word in the presence of Mr Tsonga (the tennis player) that would have been a different cattle of fish.Whatever Mr Chiles or Jo Brand complaint makes you wonder what they were trying to achieve in doing so. I like Jo Brand but look at her performances and language.That leaves very little and can be offencive to some people.As far as Mr Chiles is concerned well he rabbits on like a man possessed.  The comparison between Carole and that object J Ross is that he insulted an old man on the international air-ways. It was in-material whether he apologised later.He was probably thinking of his million.  The BBC used this as a get out for the lack of guts in the Ross saga.

Yes, i don't like PC because i think it's fine to call someone "black" just as its fine to call someone "white" or "asian" and use the term " short" rather than "height disadvantaged".

U8XTbQgraa	Well as everybody was encouraged by Labour and Tory Government to own there own home and people were even sold 125% mortgages to do so and with the credit crunch millions of homes have gone into negative equity what would you have them do put millions on the street?If people could afford a Mortgage at 5% it stands to reason at 1% they will have money left over to spend hence helping to restart the economy.Which in turn will eventually help those with savings because as things improve so will the interest rate.Now don't get me wrong i detest this Government but for once this actually seems a little sensible.  Of course building societies are against it they are looking for a killing as usual(the greedy twa-ts)And as a saver think yourself lucky you have any savings left because if not for the tax payer that would be gone as well.

How much food you consume depends largely on what service you are going into :) I can only speak for the Marines, but during the first few weeks of boot camp, everyone got their food, and after having your tray inspected by a DI for nutritional completeness, you sat down with your hands on your knees and looked straight ahead until everyone was seated. The "Guide" (Recruit 'In Charge") would be the last to sit, the DI would stand behind him, and tell him to start eating, once he started, you could start. You are allowed only to eat with your left hand, and you are allowed to drink only water (We got "Powerade" the last week I was there, yay!). After 30 seconds to a minute, the DI will tell the guide to stop and get up, at which point you must stop and do the same, then you file out of the chow hall, dump most of the meal that's left into the trash, return your tray, and line up outside the chow hall to continue training.    Oh, and what Darsh said is right, get some bread, and make a quick sandwhich out of literally everything on your tray, slop some corn in there, some rice, a piece of chicken, peanut butter, whatever, and eat as fast as you can, don't drink until the end, it's easier to drink fast than to eat fast so you can sneak in a few seconds extra while people are getting up.

That translates to three decent meals and a place to sleep.    When I went through Army basic our food was very good.  That was mainly because we had a company size mess hall (fed about 200 men).  But in the beginning they don't give you much time for either breakfast or lunch. The evening meal was a little more relaxed as was Sunday meals.  By the time you reach the end of your training things are more relaxed.  In spite of it all I still managed to increase my weight from 144 to 175 pounds in less than ten weeks.  After basic I went to a different post and attended school for the next six months.  During that time I took my meals in a consolidated mess hall that on average served several thousand meals three times a day.  The food was much worse but edible, except for the liver which should have been buried rather than served.  After all training was finished I went overseas and also ate in a consolidated mess but the food was pretty good.  I guess the bottom line was that it isn't always the quality of the food but rather the preparation as well.  The food types (variety) are pretty much what you might expect to find in a common reasonably priced civilian restaurant.  The only thing that I really tired of eating was ham, which even though it was pretty good was served too often.

Nagin has over a 140 cars more than the 60 cars city guidelines allow, he cut the city's trash pick up before the cars which his staff are using for personal use (Like driving out of town for vacation, using the gas cards to fill up friend's tanks & even allowing their children to drive them to school)|`|1778b52a6dfa7f556791c3baa059ce9aaa	why does everyone need to slam obama on here? he was been president for not even a month and he doesnt get a chance. instead of slamming him why dont you support him?|`|WgruZkHRaa	Head of finance do to the wonderful record deficit IL has this year.

For over 20 years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been carefully, on a 5 year cycle, preparing World Assessments on these concerns.  These world-wide teams of respected scientists only utilized peer-reviewed science papers .  They issued their 4th Assessment Report in early 2007 and that major report had much stronger language that human activity and the burning of fossil fuels most probably was causing the observed trends upward of average global temperatures.  This report was so important that it won the Nobel Peace Prize.  Yes, reasonable, average citizens can and will disagree on how much our civilizations should change our energy sources and programs and by when.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I think the "man-made" global warming is a political lie.

It's a long-term, *global* trend.    *Of course* there are natural changes to the climate. But we're making it worse, and that's the real problem.

That means the earth existed more than 4.5 BILLION years without them... So, I argue we would survive once they are gone... which I also argue would happen whether or not we even existed.

Every several hundred-thousand years, the axis of the Earth shifts and the last time that happened was several hundred-thousand years ago.  Its not an overnight change but a slow process that takes hundreds of years and we simply appear to be in the first stages of the Earth's natural climactic "shift".|`|fRkX3Gfdaa	It is a lie. There have been 31,072 (so far) scientists sign a petition against "Global Warming" Policies.    "We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.     There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth."|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	I feel global warming is legitimate. However, I feel it is more of a natural occurrence that the earth goes through every so many hundreds and thousands of years. It has been proved that the earth has gone through many of these changes through history. I feel that pollution many speed up the process slightly but not to the extent that the fear mongers that want millions of our tax dollars to fund their little research wants us to believe.|`|8TZzjGsnaa	Global warming happens all the time. It is supposed to happen.|`|gkrNPM5Daa	The lie is that man is causing warming and can somehow control the earth. On their own global warming shows they show the proof that man isn't the cause. The permafrost melting in Alaska for example; they say it is exposing plant life that has been frozen for a long time and we need to stop what we are doing. I say if plants are frozen then Alaska was obviously green and warm before the snow came which was long before man. The global warming studies just prove that the earth has gone thru some big global changes prior to Al Gore and mankind. So is it possible for the earth to change in big ways... of course, but Al's global warming spin is bologna.

6irpnGEtaa	Yes indeed it is possible, you can hate and not support a war, but we have a responsability as civilians to take care of our troops while they are home as well as out in a war zone. The greatest, most prescious and important NATIONAL TREASURE of our country, is the courageous men and women that are serving our country. Our soldiers mission is to defend and protect all of us and to preserve our Costitution and our way of govenment.     Regardless of weather a war is supported by the civilian population of our country or not, our men and women in uniform have always needed and will always need the support of their families and the general public. Support from home is one of the most important things that a soldier can have while they are out in "Theater". If they perceive that the general population is against their mission for whatever reasons, they will loose focus of their misssion and could possibly end up injured or dead.    It is very important to support our soldiers always, no matter how we may personally feel about a war. One of my sons was in Iraq for 3 years and one of my daughters was there for one year; some of the things that lifted their spirits was to know that people were praying for them and to receive mail and packages from home. It was a shared experience for them all, even for the ones that never got any mail or packages at all.    Now that, a soldier fighting in a war thousands of miles away from their family and friends and not receiving one single letter or a package, is a very, very sad thing to experience and to see happening.    You don`t like the war for whichever reason, go and protest, but supporting our children in such a dangerous endeavor as a war can be as easy as buying things that they may need, puttinng them in a box and mailing it out to a soldier who is serving in Theater. Contact the USO for info on how you can support our soldiers, their families and other organisations that are already providing all kinds of help for them.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	Definatley. I served in the USMC for a tour ( It wasn't the lifestyle for me, but I put my time in) and my brothers have each served in one of the other branches (oldest was a seaman, 2nd oldest was a soldier and the youngest was an airman). Every male member of my family served in one of the branches with the exception of my uncle. We support the troops fully (by support I mean actually sending care packages, not just putting the yellow ribbon on our cars, that's a fashion statement, not support).      However none of us agree with the war in Iraq. I agree with troops in Afghanistan, we had a purpose for being there. I don't agree with the culture of Iraq, but it's their country, they can do whatever they want.

The short answer over all is this:  The soldier in Iraq does support the war in Iraq and is there putting his life on the line.   IF you support the soldier you must support the war. They defend and fight in your name, for you, for your country. Not for glory or personal gain but for everyone because you need them to because not everyone can so they will for the good of the country.    Thumbs down people: THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH YOUR "YELLOW" RIBBON BUMPER STICKERS     YELLOW IS THE COLOR OF COWARDICE !!!!!

EapVGOgYaa	The attitude of a dept. is usually determinable with a little effort  Dept. that are pseudo-military and have the attitude of a professional organization are out there.  Most state police units are what you're looking for.  You check out a community by observing the activity of the police.  How do they dress, how do they present themselves. One that I like is to check the manner in which a dept. communicates on the radio, get a scanner for instance.    Many times departments will advertise in the newspaper.  I know recently I have seen ads for NYC, Ft. Lauderdale, and Houston.    As far as what bothers me the most, I admit it is a close call, but the think that gets me is when officers get careless. They forget their training and do things that could place themselves and others in danger.  Vehicle stops in particular are troublesome.  Some officers will stop and approach vehicles and then  call for driver and vehicle information from dispatch. Or they'll park their cruisers or stand in a dangerous spot.  Officers usually know  when they are going to be attempting a vehicle stop... they have time to radio in before the actual stop...."attempting to stop NYREG 756-HNG on Winter Street heading north of the water tower."  This takes seconds and could save your life. Let backup have time to head in your direction.  The ideal situation is to have backup arrive before you even have exited your vehicle.  It is amazing how two cruisers and two officers can control a situation and act as deterrent to trouble.  Good luck.|`|e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	The "good" officers who see the laziness and substandard work you describe, and who do nothing in response to it, are no better than the slackers.  There's a thing known as "esprit de corps."  It just doesn't happen.  It has to be developed and drilled into an organization from the get-go.  The Marine Corp is an example of an organization with esprit de corp.  If an organization has it, the slacker mentality of which you speak is not tolerated by the other members.  The ranking officers don't have to deal with it because the rank-and-file will run them off if they don't get with it.  My guess is that your police academy is not of the boot-camp, stress variety, and is more like the average junior college setting.  If that's correct, then you're going to end up with people like you describe.  If you don't like it now, you'll never like it.  My advice is to start looking now for another agency that has esprit de corps.  Finish the academy you are in, but then get the hell out of that agency and into one that will make you proud.  Most state police agencies run stress academies where esprit de corps is integral to the agency's success and image.  One of which I am familiar is the Arkansas State Police.  Those are some polished, hard-working troopers, and I believe there are actively recruiting.|`|2SEVDjpnaa	I hate how some of us get off on being assholes and crave the fear-inspired respect that people begrudgingly show us.

Nothing more nothing less.     Fact is, the bill can be passed with or with out Republican votes.   Another fact is NO One knows with certainty if this bill will Definitely work or not. Especially the Republicans. 1st it was "there is not enough Tax cuts in the plan.." well we all know how "tax cuts" worked out the last 8 years. Then, it was "we need to fix housing 1st.." no one is buying houses now, who can afford it and if they are able to buy now, they obviously don't need assistance in doing so. Then it became " it's too much spending on things we don't need, things that won't stimulate the economy.." I'm sorry but it's been clear for a very long time that Republicans in our congress have absolutely no idea what stimulates the economy. If they knew, they would not have ignored the Middle Class for so long.     All this talk about "pork" and "this is not the change we need" it's all said to get those that can be so easily influenced by rhetoric to second guess what Obama is trying to do.   I for one am not convinced that the Republicans have a "better" plan.     Democrats have a proven record that they are better with the economy. This plan has many things in it that will help the middle class and help start the pump for the economy. START, not solve. This is step 1 of many steps that need to be taken. We have a long ways to go...and here you have the Republicans blocking that 1st important step because they want to continue with an approach to the Economy that has failed. Their perception of what makes a good economy obviously has not worked.     Step aside Republicans. Take your note books out and write it down.  Economic equality trumps Economic freedom.

Give it a break, this question is ridiculous.|`|dfo8gSaraa	No.    At least Obama is RESPONDING to the emergency (he was PRAISED for doing so) and not doing a 'fly by' like our previous President.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	The only thing that is official is the ignorance of those that see this as a problem caused by Obama and not as another steaming pile left behind by bush.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Rev Wright has NO place in politics.

ZaoMZe6uaa	Christianity has had a huge influence on the world's politics. I'd argue that it's influence has been much greater than Islam's throughout history. And much more violent than Islam.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	No.  I don't think it has any more influence than other large religions.|`|asX2hxFXaa	US - Our Constitution is largely based on Christian values.  Isreal - do I need to say anything about them?    The difference is that in Islam, the beleif is that religious leaders should be state leaders.  This is the foundation of so much rife in the Middle East between tyrannical and sectarian countries who are threatened by Islamic militants trying to overthrow and control the governments.|`|D6kwriPxaa	Now that is the funniest question I have heard in a long time.  The far right fundamentalist Christians own the Republican party.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Nope|`|GBC39wHAaa	Only if you live in the middle east, and in Indonesia but the rest of the world doesn't revolve around any political stands to Islam.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	OMG  In some countries if you were not baptized in the Catholic church you do not exist.  You cannot get a birth certificate because the priest doesn't have your name in his baptismal book.    Politics and all religions go hand in hand.    Romney, Huckabee, and Palin lost because of religion.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	not in my corner of the world. just yours i guess|`|PtHThRoNaa	Uh no.  How about right wing so- called Christian agendas?|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	How about Christianity?    During the last administration we got creationism in schools, faith based initiatives and almost got discrimination into our Constitution.|`|DjdZOeUlaa	No, consider Jewish Faith and Israel; and Catholic Church and Italy and Hindu faith and India|`|AA11993638	So which politics are you referring to? In muslim countries maybe. In over all world politics, there are many major religions that influence the political state of a nation or even lower level of government. Catholicism, the Jewish, and even the Christian religions have major influence on the political policies of many parts of the world. Even atheist are attempting to draw control of many policies, the question is if you believe this is a religion in terms of someones personal beliefs or not is a matter of opinion. Each group attempts to influence policies based on their own beliefs. Some for the betterment of mankind and some for making things a lot worse for the majority.|`|73A0T8ltaa	No, but it's well documented in some of the Islamist's itinerary to dominate through manipulation. And these are groups that thrive on charity and social programs. Anyhow religion has been plagued with politics, not the opposite.  As for the far right being own3d by Christians; that is a retarded notion.  Christians are the least of your worries.   It is discrimination. Christians are the minority in the world.  As are whites. It makes you wonder why they are demonized and hated. I am glad I rarely relate to either side of this stupid hateful conflict between Muslims/Jews/Christians.  But mind you I am a Christian (Catholic) and if need be I'd jump to protect my people.  When it boils down, rednecks better quit hating Mexicans, because we're the only ones who'll even think about having your back in the end.  Working for you, sin respecto.  I wish more poor people would stop selling their dignity to the democrats so cheap. They have you stuck like chuck eating out of their hands only promising you the moon. If you hate republicans so much. take over an alternative party by voting them in. breaking that monopoly would truly be power to the people.   Peace.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:
AA11369432	No,  It like a hard job to do.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Exactly!  So naive and idealistic that it seems childish.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Not at all.  Most of Conservative talk radio is anti Obama, anti Democrat.  I doubt their views of this administration are in any way objective.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  I don't think so.  But I don't listen to yap-hate-radio.|`|ohzPenCWaa	Why do you look so angry in your picture? Is that why you listen to yap/anger-radio shows? Obama and his team have been in office for less than a month, and you people are so ready for him to fail, its pathetic. Most transitions are a little smoky, as there are a lot of thing that need to be worked out and established. Give him the full 100 days before you start looking for things to pick apart.|`|8FO52r0Maa	more like the class gerbils taking over the school|`|tcsy9b0waa	Not at all, it's like Parents taking over a school that has been in Anarchy for 8 years.|`|7HQLvG9oaa	Pizza for lunch everyday!|`|15FlstmHaa	I think so, yes.  if you mean that because he is inexperienced and now running a nation.

Nancy Pelosi seems to be taking exaggeration to another level. On January 18th on Fox News Sunday, Nancy Pelosi stated that 500 million jobs would be lost unless Obamas stimulus package was passed by Congress. Chris Wallace corrected her, stating she probably meant 500,000 jobs. Pelosi responded in her own defense, It feels like 500 million. The population of the United States is 303 million, Ms. Pelosi.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVl2nqjLV...    This is worst than the 57-58 states Barrack spoke about while running for president. It goes to show you that they just make this stuff up as they go. There are less than 350 millions of Americans adults and children. She is not even close.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDA0QRz1J...    this is the only thing that i agree with pelosi on.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59q8waklX...|`|BD7yd8D4aa	I don't think she is that stupid but when Bush made mistakes like this the media kept replaying his "fuzzy math" sound bite.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	It just goes to show the caliber of people in her voting district, and those of her party in the House.   She is that stupid, out of touch, and has more Botox than brains.|`|AA12191521	Yes she really said that. And even when someone corrected her and asked if she meant 500 thousand, she stuck with her original answer. She's a moron.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	She did--and they aren't..    She's so drunk half the time she doesn't even know where she is...have you seen that weasel face she sports?     Can dems say : Idiot?|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Oh, please!  Nancy Pelosi knows better than you do how many people are in the US, how many congressional districts there are, who represents them in Congress, how many people are in each, etc.  She misspoke.

She meant to say the actual figure, 500,000.    Half a million lost jobs should be the issue, not her simple mistake.    But you don't want to talk about real problems, do you?|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes, she really did.  Isnt it sad that she doesnt know how many people live in America?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVl2nqjLV...|`|H0sPovWTaa	Shh...  Now now can't point out the fact that she's as stupid as Palin.  Let the Libs have their fantasy that she's got a brain.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	yep,they must have included the whole 57 states obama said about.|`|u23sBafTaa	Why yes she did!  Had that been McCain we would have never heard the end of the old jokes !|`|59iSPST0aa	I just don't like the lady, whether she made a mistake or not. She is not fit for her job.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Ok, we've had our fun. Let's not be little morons like the Democrats and obsess about a misstatement. We all know she meant 500 thousand, not million.    Of course, we should recognize and point out to the Democrat true believers that Nancy was engaging in a most blatant and false fear-mongering. "Pass our Porkapalooza right now or we're all going to DIE. Aaaaaaaaaaaah!"    One would hope for much better coming from the person 3rd in line to the Presidency.|`|AA11288277	Yes she did, but no one ever accused our august Speaker of the House of being very intelligent or any good at simple math.    What I find so humorous, is the way liberals are lining up to take numbers to defend her, saying "she misspoke"...Yeah well so F_CKIN what...when Bush misspoke you libtards couldn't wait to rip him a new one..."Bush is a moron", "Bush is a dolt", "Bush is an idiot", "Bush is (add moronic liberal insult here)"...there was no end to your insults...well guess what azz hats...the shoe is now on the other foot...|`|FX4WhQtKaa	yes she's stupid............I think she meant that americans are losing 500 million dollars a month not jobs....she's talking about property and payroll taxes.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Yep!  What a great leader!|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	If I got a dime every time Bush and your Conservative Republican goofs mispoke, I could pay for the bailout myself!  So, give it a rest...
u9g2Cl6Eaa	Erm, when had they said they will bring about free food?|`|4SLjJvcqaa	We could just do what the republicans did    IGNORE    your kids' education, your healthcare, free food(for tye needy), & housing, is there?    Lest YOU forget  (I know you've been PROGRAMMED to think the housing troubles are all B. Franks fault)    BUT WHO SADDLED FREDDIE AND FANNIE with LOANS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE UNQUALIFIED ?? (AFTER they supposedly sounded the warning bell that these two were in trouble)      Wasn't Bush brilliant in creating government financing plans so people did not need downpayments on their home?  in the middle of a housing bubble?    More Americans than ever own their own homes, but we must continue to work hard so that every family has an opportunity to realize the American Dream. In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives.     NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities recognizing the importance of homeownership.     http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/...|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Your premise is false.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	You summed up the Democrats plan perfectly.

DsEEATKSaa	http://www.thomas.gov/    (listed in red at the top of the page)    ~Dr. B.~|`|AA11707728	Probably nowhere.  Remember the bailout?  Congress itself asked for the details of where the money went.  They were told it wasn't any of their business.
DypTl9Zdaa	You are right.  What economists have discovered during tough times is that people do not spend money whether they get it for free from the government or not.  They will typically pay down their debts or they stash it.    Statistically speaking...the personal savings rate in the last quarter of 2008 was the highest it has been in six years.  So you have people saving their money and banks are fearful of giving out loans so are holding on to their money as well.  Long story short...no amount of "stimulus" money is going to help our economy right now.      Just another bit of trivia...The Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis is now holding upwards of 1.7 trillion dollars for American banks, more than twice than what it had in its vaults at the beginning of 2008.  Once the banks got their bail out money they asked the Fed to hold on to it which means...they didn't lend it out, they didn't use it to stimulate the economy.  It is their little nest egg.      Makes you think doesn't it?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	More like arrogance to think that this time it will work because you are the one trying it.  Obama is floundering now that he has lost his internet buddies.

Now he doesn't know what to do that he is being questioned.|`|AA11424005	If you could get them to take lie detector tests, you would find that they don't believe it.

Why the sudden flip flop?|`|NZuJR79oaa	why do the republicans think the same way?  There are not really two parties, there is one incumbent party made up of career politicians, to keep getting re-elected they need to bring home the bacon to their district.

It was Nixon I believe who said, "We are all Keynesian's now."      Now, I admit that in the face of the 70s stagflation, Keynesian policy had no answer.  But lately I've seen a lot of revisionist history claiming it never worked at all.  And that is wrong and is a willful misreading of basic economic history of this country.  Sorry, just because some peoples partisan ideology doesn't want it to work doesn't mean that it doesn't work.|`|AA11388462	They always get it backward|`|DjdZOeUlaa	You are correct, that is one of many definitions of insanity.  As to why the Democrats (and many Republicans as well) favor Keynesian fiscal policy is they believe the American people cannot handle the alternative.  Class warfare, food riots, National Guard shooting American citizens, massive looting as people go crazy with fear.   Remember FDR's spending did not get America out of the Great Depression, World War II did.|`|Vnu2HBBLaa	To understand, try to see from their point of view- shove your head up your butt.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	It is insane.  The stimulus bill is already larger than the economies of most countries on earth.

They DON'T work when 1% of the population has over 50% of the wealth (LIKE TODAY). They do work when wealth is spread throughout the working class.

You're right...that doesn't make much sense.  The problem is that American people don't all know what is REALLy going on because of our wonderful media that only tells Americans what they want Americans to know.      The government keeps spending because liberals are trying to implement socialism, plain and simple.    Chiques - look at the Soviet Union and, now, Russia.

9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Unfortunatly, your uncle has full access to anything, including bank accounts.  The only thing he cannot do for her is vote in her name and get married in her name.      There is something called a 'Renunciation of Power" which your grandmother would have to sign and it would revoke the first POA.  It will do you no good to get a lawyer or make a fuss about it, as long as grandma was in her right mind and he is who she wants, it's solid.     There is no medical areas to a Durable POA.  For that, she needs to have a Healthcare POA, she will appoint someone to make choices for her if she is unable.  She makes choices of her own (life support, nutritional extremes, etc.) and it's up to that person to carry those wishes out.|`|AA11206283	Right in most cases to act as that person in all transactions financial and legal.

Your grandfather needs to see a lawyer.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The following pdf relates specifically to Texas and is not a substitute for legal advice, but contains much useful general information on the durable power of attorney.

It may specify only medical decisions, ir may specify only financial ones, it may be a blanket - or it may be only the authority to renew her gym membership - it's ENTIRELY up to the grantor.    Also, a PoA does NOT grant the grantee any power "over" the grantor. It merely allows the grantee to act on the grantors behalf. If the grantee does something the grantor dissaproves of, she can override him.    Richard
AWQ5VHeqaa	we can not feel secure, he double talked about his birth place, he is freeing terrorists from gitmo, he has a relative that is an illegal immigrant and will not do anything to change illegal immigration except back it with more free health care to children of illegal immigrants, his half brother in kenya was arrested for drugs, we can not feel safe.  money for family planning and contraceptives all this wreaks of hitler-ism he is living up to his promises he made in his speeches and debates that many americans did not listen to or want to hear even his cap on ceo pay is a lie if he wanted to cap their pay it would apply to all banks and agencies that have already received bailout money and he would also set an example of changing by cutting his pay in half from 400 thousand dollars a year to 200 thousand dollars a year and he would also stop nominating inside lobbyists for positions which he promised to do during his campaign and has proved he wants change that is only changes from his actual promises to what he is doing now.
6ELSwKKvaa	Many people have made this connection with the name thing. I think it is just a coincidence. I would be more likely to bet that Bush was in league with Osama than Obama is. I mean, come on... he caught Saddam but somehow couldn't get a grip on Osama? Also, after 9/11 during the "no fly" time.... Bush had the Bin Laden family flown OUT of the United States! There wasn't even any attempt to interview or detain them!      Although there are coincidences with the names, I really think that Obama wants to try to create change. He also has a great burden because he is the first black president in our country. If he fails, he not only fails himself but he also fails the entire black community. There will be no place in the United States that will be safe for him if he does not do well with his presidency. He has a lot at stake and he knows it. If He fails, he will have set black rights back and they are looking to him to bring their image forward.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	wow, you just realized this now? the republican ppl on the radio and tv pointed this out like 2 years ago|`|pnpkJKvpaa	2008 called, it wants its tired accusations back.|`|DyZreluEaa	Yes I have noticed that too. I am on Obama's side, but do you think somethings up? Well, we will see in the next four years.|`|sfCnE2O4aa	If it mattered that Obama rhymed with Osama I'd care, but it doesn't, so I don't.  However, I see the connection you see and have to laugh that people believe Osama bin Laden was the mastermind behind 9/11, which he wasn't, OBVIOUSLY, yet they vote for a guy with the name of their enemy and the middle name of the guy in Iraq the USA has donated many lives to stop, Saddam Hussein.  It's a testimonial to the gullibility of the American people.  An ironic slap in the face if you will.  Too bad our complacency and ignorance as a nation is costing so many lives, not only of our own countrymen and women, but in other countries as well.  We foolishly allow our politicians to stage phony attacks on us and then we comply and attack someone else.  As a nation, we are shameful at best.|`|13fDE4nGaa	I guess maybe you Judge books by there Covers as well?|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	If you look up the meaning of the names, you will note that Obama's name is Afrikan while Osama is Arabic. That said, they have different meanings: Osama means lion - like Simba... LOL  and Obama means bent, usually given to some birth defect kids or born in breech position... It makes me wonder.   Lion (Osama) might have something to point to the 'lion that roars' - in reference to the Bible prediction of the end times, or the desire of his parents to make a leader of their son.   Bent - (Obama) on the other hand... means multiple things. Could be a prediction of his character, he's bending the rules as we speak, or some major defect the parents noticed at birth. Perhaps his mom 'bent the rules too.  Who knows. The fact that they rhyme might suggest they're in it together, see it's transcending the cultural barriers. LOL - and the fact that he was raised a Muslim, well. that closes the gap. I can write a whole book about it, but I want to make money on it. What's interesting to observe though is that Obama and Osama do have the same personality complex. NPD. Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Which are traits of tyranny and despotism. Nice suit for the socialistic dictator, or new Fuhrer/ Hitler!|`|oxeAYFGzaa	I don't like Obama for other reasons beside his name...but once i heard who his running mate was I wondered how long it would be before someone else saw the coincidence that i did with the names.   I just hope that is all it is and that we haven't elected someone to office who is planning something against america.|`|xu3GCouraa	I think his name sounds like a muslim jihad terrorist.|`|1thElV58aa	his name means light, lighting in hebrew|`|iaMBgc6iaa	I always thought the name was a little weird.

I'm sure they would have named them something else.  Who knew?|`|9BUc0lgjaa	yes many many many people noticed this. and a bunch of stupid ones actually cared. do you realize how idiotic it is to judge someone based on the similarity of their names?|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Yes.  I thought so, too, especially on the bumper sticker with the Obama name on top and Biden right under.    "ObamaBi(la)den" and "McCainPalin" comparison.|`|AA11450062	Well you are a good example of how our education system is screwed up. I don`t agree with everything Obama is doing but he is doing what he can to fix our Republican economy.|`|AA10458195	You know he didn't choose his name. I didn't choose mine.

Or will he make decisions to turn us for the worst?

I have told my Senators not to expect my vote in 2010 because of the Wall Street bail out already.   I suggest everyone check their own Representatives vote records and campaign contributors then let them know what you think.  Did you know that voting records for Federal Politicians can be found at votesmart.org?  And from there political contributors information can be found through a link to opensecrets.org?   http://www.vote-smart.org    Example of just one Senator's information at opensecrets:  Top 5 Contributors, 2003-2008  Merrill Lynch $371,745   Citigroup Inc $308,451   Morgan Stanley $262,777   Goldman Sachs $255,345   JPMorgan Chase & Co $226,307     Clearly their interests is themselves and not "Main Street" What could the House of Representatives and the Senate do immediately to ease the financial crisis?  That would should good faith? That would show that the problems of "Main Street" do matter? That the middle class would have to respect and even consider heroic?  How about reversing one or two of the pay raises they voted for themselves? Or pay 50% of their own medical coverage?  You do know that after voting for the bail out they ended their sessions KNOWING that when they returned they would enjoy the AUTOMATIC pay rasies they had set up for themselves? Then they use the "evil other party finger pointing" to keep us from holding them personally accountable.

Our government is supposed to have 3 areas of representation:  The People (as represented by the House)  The States (as represented by the Senate)  The Federal Union (as represented by the President)    The liberal view is that since people are too incompetent to take care of themselves it is the government's job to do it for them and in order to do that we need to ignore the interests of both the People and the States and vest more power in the Federal Union so that we can mandate things across the board.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Because OTHER THAN  the lame *** lie that MOST of their BASE has believed in for yrs  (GOP will stop abortion)  (they've been saying that for 30 yrs and haven't done it  YET many Republicans think Obama should have fixed their mess in his 17 days in office)    What does the G O P offer    certainly NOT fiscal responsibility   (doubling a deficit that took 200 yrs to build in 8 short yrs!!)    certainly not human compassion  (condoning torture and setting our good will & above the terrorists standing BACK 100 yrs)    certainly not patriotism   ( after the President outs a CIA Agent---and don't whine she wasn't covert----BECAUSE she WAS AT ONE TIME nad EVERY one of her CONTACTS were compromised and put in great danger)      What?|`|8FO52r0Maa	because Oprah and all the cool kids vote that way|`|GfIwCC6saa	If you like Socialism this is your party!|`|2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	Compassion.

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOE REPUBLICAN    Joe gets up at 6 a.m. and fills his coffeepot with water to prepare his morning coffee. The water is clean and good because some tree-hugging liberal fought for minimum water-quality standards. With his first swallow of water, he takes his daily medication. His medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised. All but $10 of his medications are paid for by his employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Joe's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.    In the morning shower, Joe reaches for his shampoo. His bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.    Joe begins his work day. He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe's employer pays these standards because Joe's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, he'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think he should lose his home because of his temporary misfortune.    It's noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression. Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and his below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.    Joe is home from work. He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive. His car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. His was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans. The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification.    He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn't have to.    Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn't mention that the beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day. Joe agrees: "We don't need those big-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I'm a self-made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have."|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Umm, Ahhhh, Uhh....Wait a minute...no, that's not it...Umm....nope not that either....Ahhh, Ummm.....O crap, I can't think of ANY reason to vote democrat.

ynt3LAX3aa	Obama had a chance to show his sincerity and he blew it.  He proved to be a social climber and a status seeker and he also refused to apologize for it.  Had I been elected President and I was facing these challenges, I would have asked my finance people to get me the prices for all these hooplas and then I would have addressed the people on the capitol steps explaining what it would cost for all the "fun" and "games" at the people's expense.  Then I would have immediately placed that money in a fund for the people -- to be used for health care, food, mortgage help, etc.  I would have taken my oath of office on the Capital steps in a 15 minute ceremony and I would have worn my old coat and my best suit from my closet and kept the costs at a minimum.  I also would have explained that at a time when all citizens are making supreme sacrifices and are being taxed and priced out of their homes and are being outsourced out of their jobs that it would be important for a President and his family to be on good terms with average americans instead of pay to play politicians.    When Obama said his election trumped another person, he proved his arrogance and his anti-Americanism.  Furthermore, he has refused to upohold the Constitution of the USA both as Senator and now as President when he fails to require that the immigration laws be enforced and that voter registration roles be checked for fraud.  When he demands that our private medical records be placed on line, he is violating our fourth amendment right to be secure in our persons place and possessions and he has actually promoted the seizure of our most important asset -- our good name and our records and our privacy!  Obama is, in my opinion, a traitor and his spending will continue to prove him one.  He refuses to take care of U.S. Citizens and insists on taking care of foreign-owned banks and cow-towing to economic terrorists who want our identities and control of our individual finances!

zJAmqLnAaa	When you do your taxes, they (the government) ask you how much you received for the stimulus check and your answer must match the amount you were sent.  My concern would be if they checked to see if it was cashed.  I was not given the correct amount last year so I was given the difference in my tax refund.  You could claim zero as your amount and see if they give you the difference of what you were owed,|`|3nqyxHrgaa	no the government is not that respectful.

KTM5JEkLaa	No.  The doctor will not be able to medicate you without your consent.  If the doctor feels you are a danger to yourself, they are obligated by law to do an involuntary detention and have you held for 48 - 72 hours depending on the state.  If you become so psychotic that you need to be medicated for your own safety, it would only be in a hospital.    One point, if you are seeing a doctor about your condition, why refuse treatment that the doctor recommends?  It does sound as if you are suffering from some sort of anxiety or mild psychosis, so if the doctor tries to give you medication to help it, you need to take it.|`|Hu0QKdmDaa	Well, it depends. If the person is not compus mentis, uhm, as if they do not have a good grip of reality then someone can be used to have power of attorney.    But, generally, they are not permitted to administer medication to you without informing you.    That's unethical and illegal.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	No he can't do that. It looks like you have a little paranoia happening to you. But, I know from experience that if a doctor thinks you need an anti psychotic, then you probably do need it. You can't see yourself that you have a problem, but others sure do and so does your doctor. This is very, very common to be in denial of having a problem. I have seen this many times. Once your on medication, then you will see and feel the difference. It is almost like a miracle. Trust in your doctor, for you need to trust somebody.|`|AA11622716	Not the way you describe.  If the doc feels you are a danger to yourself or others, he can arrange to have you involuntary committed to a hospital.

When people short the bank by overdraft, it costs you and the other depositors.  When the government bails out banks, they are bailing you out.      If the situation is so bad that banks need to be bailed and aren't, that means the bank will fail and take your money with it.  While the FDIC technically insures accounts, that doesn't begin to cover what would happen if whole banks suddenly faced dissolution.    Policymakers always take banks seriously because they are often linked - too many other financial institutions are necessarily connected with the financial health of any one of them - imagine a couple of guys climbing a mountain connected by a single cable, and you get the idea.  If enough of them fall off, they'll take the healthy ones down with them.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	The two issues are completely unrelated.    You signed an agreement with your bank.  It stated that under certain conditions, you would be charged a fee.  It's as simple as that.  Don't do the things that incur fees, and you won't pay them.    I haven't paid a bank fee for 20 yrs.    Government aid is intended to rescue the banking system, mainly because foolish people who took out mortgages too large for their income are now running from their debt.  If the government does not kick in some cash (which is not a gift, by the way, simply temporary loans), the banking system of the country will collapse.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	They can charge any fee they like.     What gets me is that they are using the money to pay shareholder dividends. No. Their money should just be gone. It should be the price paid for the shareholder not paying attention and not demanding that the bank run itself in an honest manner.    The biggest problem is that since the 80s we've allowed companies to go merger crazy...combine and get bigger and bigger until they literally reach a size where they can't be allowed to fail...it'd be too huge a hit to the market and the industry. Like AIG? They underwrote HALF of all the insurance in this country..    Any company that large should be forcibly broken into smaller pieces as a condition of the bailout. That way in 10 years if one or two of those smaller companies can't cut it, the free market can do its thing and they can go under without it being a body blow to the rest of the world..|`|8zelZj3Aaa	Banking is no longer the service it used to be. It is a business now and it is their business to make money. And, it's no longer a fair profit market, it has become a market of greed, "as much and as fast as possible by whatever means possible". For some they can't make enough and for others there simply isn't enough. From a fair profit market, days of old, to today's "greedy" market. It's that old Adamic nature again.

GC9Xqz3xaa	The environmental regulations I will never understand.  I can see making laws against blatantly dumping oil in the ocean and things like that, but these regulations are ridiculous.      Employment needs to be regulated so they can make sure everyone pays their taxes.    Both measures are simply about control.  I don't think the government needs to regulate them at all.  Government has the been at the root of all the problems this country has ever faced.|`|r8Sme80raa	I guess it depends on what you mean by "regulate".    Why does government regulate anything?    Laws are passed generally regulate behavior, both good & bad.  Each level of government regulates a different aspect of the topic in question.|`|64SObnr5aa	The root of all evil would be to let private enterprise have a free hand.    That will eventually result in a small upper class of extremely wealthy, no middle class and a vast poor class.    History has proven that with revolutions in Russia, Cuba, China and France to name a few, all the result of unregulated capitalism.    Regulations were put in place to assure a vast middle class.  Deregulation do not have the assumed benefit of increased competition and lower prices in some cases, such as our communications system and banking, it has resulted in higher fees and a far more difficult system to navigate through.      All systems that have a capitalistic economic system has controls in place to assure the rich do not get out of control.      One of the area's I think needs controls is at the wholesale level, where we need to level the playing field.  Huge box stores should not be able to sell at low prices always, but only on convenience.  That will assure the little guy thrives by no longer allowing wholesalers to give the big guy huge buying power.      Really, think about it, would you rather have a Home Depot and next to it a small ma and pa hardware store selling the same products, with less choice, as the big guy?  Well, it works and living proof is where I live, as a transplanted American, China, where the little guy thrives next to the big guy.    It is time to get America back to work and that is but one of many ways that will not cost the taxpayer a dime. It will only pissss off the stock holders of the big guys and of course the Walton family which has WalMarts in China that are thriving next to the little guy.    Peace  Jim    .|`|43885d249f6e12d0c9543cbcbaffc9bbaa	At one time, neither did either.    Employment regulation came about in the late 1800 and early 1900 as labor unions became stronger and there were numerous examples of violence and the labor movement.  Neither management or labor had clean hands but  the situation needed regulation to protect people and their rights.  The environment regulations really started in the late 1960s and early 1970.  With the creation of the EPA, national control was provided.  Again,  improvement was thoroughly needed as many rivers, lakes, streams were polluted with waste, as was the air in major industrial cities.  Even septic systems weren't required in many states.|`|e4fdad2a4b8172efe8cf20fd51951036aa	Well, one easy answer would be that the federal government has the authority, under our constitution, to regulate interstate commerce.  Employment issues (both individual issues like discrimination as well as collective action issues affecting labor unions) and environmental issues at the local level often have a profound affect on interstate commerce.    One of the places where the current Supreme Court has acted to invalidate or limit some federal employment discrimination laws has been in the area of actions by state governments.  One explanation has been that the regulation of the employment relationship between a state and its employees is not a matter that affects interstate commerce.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The root of all evil would be to turn control over to the Federal Government.  Societies that have done so, were suffering high unemployment and high taxation long before this economic slow down.  The reason is that only Free Enterprise is an actual Wealth Generator.  Socialist systems, on the other hand, can only ration what already exists.    At one time, there was no regulation of any sort and Capitalists ran wild.  Now there is too much regulation and Capitalism is far too hindered.    As a wise man once said, the trouble with Socialism is Socialism; the trouble with Capitalism is Capitalists.  Sure, a bit of control of the behavior is in order but the less the better.    *

mO7FOXNYaa	I got a RO on an ex, 6 years ago...so it's kind of fuzzy.    First: File a complaint with the Police. This will help your case. Make sure that you tell this guy at least once that you do not want to talk to him. If he persists, go to the cops. The charge may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it may be stalking, harassment, etc.    Best thing you can do is call the local police station, or go there, and ask them the best route.    What may happen (it differs from district, state, city, ect) is that you go to the court house (clerk of courts) and go to the Civil Dept. and file the restraining order there.    They will ask you questions to determine if the actions of this guy warrants a RO. (If you happen to have any offense reports on ANY thing that he has done TO you - it will help A LOT!).    Once they determine if you should get one - you will probably need a judge to sign it. They will direct you to a judge (they usually have offices in the court house). Most times, the judge's secretary will just sign it for you.    They will serve him with it -  you don't have to worry about it.    Since he knows where you work, make sure to give your boss or supervisor's a copy of the RO. That way, if he does show up, they can just call the cops (and not even involve you).|`|tFVyfvS3aa	You need to get an emergency order of protection. Go to your county courthouse and there should be an advocate that will give you the paper work to fill out ,once you have done this you will go in front of the Judge who will in turn either grant the emergency order or deny. If he grants your request you will be given a temporary order and a court date in which to return to get a permanent 2 year order. Make sure you are very clear in your request that you are fearful of what he may do and that he is stalking you and harassing you.|`|LZVc3Uwaaa	if you go to the pd and explain the situation to them  they will give you better advice for your area but................i feel it is grounds for a restraining order and you would have to go to your local court house fill out the paper work and then turn it in to the clerk he/she will give it to a judge then you will have to talk to the judge most places this takes about two hours to complete............ but before you do this try telling the guy you want nothing to do with him and if he persist that you will file for a restraining order.|`|mUSzHFeWaa	Well, you could stalk someone, or physically assault them.

I'd assume they would give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe get a "fake boyfriend" for a while... If he is jealous... he might leave you alone but that depends on his character. If he is selfish enough... he might try to harm you or the guy you are dating.|`|Wch2WybQaa	I think you should answer one of his calls and explain to him that you don't wish to be in contact with him anymore, and listen to him when you do.

If after doing that he continues to harass you then get the restraining order.|`|AA12089018	Your local county courthouse.

Sure, there is state-sponsored terrorism in the world, but there are also terrorists in countries whose governments hunt them down without mercy.    Despite the talk of the leaders of Iran, you can bet that the vast majority of Iranian people do not hate anyone, and only want to be left alone in peaceful co-existence with the Infidels--as the Koran orders that they do.    Despite my great respect for American justice (I'm Canadian), it is offensive to me that persons can be detained without charge for years without ever seeing an American judge.    There is no doubt that some if not many if not all of the detainees may be terrorists, or may support the terrorists goals, or may do so now after in some cases years of detention that is illegal under international law.  The ones who are terrorists will not go home to their countries, put on army uniforms, and attack American military personnel on a battlefield someplace.  They will sneak around like cockroaches under a rock, maiming and killing innocent civilians.  The Koran forbids war against Christians and Jews other than for immediate self-defence, and attacks on non-combattants are considered to be sacreligious.    It is a terrible shame that there are so many disobedient Muslims, and disobedient Christians as well.    The others who are not now and never were terrorists will go back to their disrupted lives.    By the way, the Koran also specifically forbids war other than to prevent the destruction of Islam, and the destruction of Islam is not a goal of the US government or the US armed forces.  You will no doubt be aware that thousands of the brave American (and British, and Canadian) soldiers you're talking about are Muslims themselves.    In my opinion, and with the greatest respect, your question reveals an approach to this problem that is quite oversimplifed.|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	This is another shot at appeasement with the democrats in power.  Talking to a terrorist is a sign of weakness, and terrorists (especially those from shame-based cultures) thrive on using signs of weaknesses to advance their own goals.  Terrorists do not look at diplomacy with a positive or humanitarian view; instead they see it as a chance to move themselves into a stronger position.  Still, the democrats would rather give the benefit of the doubt to those who have killed and/or destroyed in the past and give them a political "get out of jail free" card.    Follow that up with the tough talk coming out of Washington's democrat majority when it comes to our defense.  The concept behind the "paper tiger" is that one side puts up a strong public (and publicized) front, yet does nothing to back up their words and rhetoric.  This is also known as "saber rattling", talking a tough game yet not following through on their speeches.

MeeJWmGtaa	A child born outside the United States may have a claim to United States citizenship if one (or both) of the parents is a U.S. citizen. In either case, the parents should report the birth to the United States Consular office having jurisdiction over the childs place of birth.    To report the birth of a child, personal appearance both of the American parent and the child is required in front of a U.S. Consular Officer. The person reporting the birth of a child must complete an Application for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad. This document can be mailed upon request. It's recommend that you apply for the social security number as well, to do so please complete the form SS-5.    The supporting documents listed below must be presented:        * The childs local birth certificate (or certified copy)      * Evidence of U.S. citizenship of the parent(s). A U.S. passport or state certified copy of a U.S. birth certificate is acceptable. The non-US parent has to present ID as well.      * Evidence of marriage: in cases where the marriage took place in the United States, the original of the parents marriage certificate. If the marriage took place abroad other than the U.S., the original document or a family book will be accepted instead.      * Evidence of dissolution of any previous marriage(s) of the parent(s), if applicable (divorce record or decree). The original or a certified copy is required.      * Physical Presence Sheet (available at the Consular Section), relative to the American parents precise periods of residence in and out of the United States.      * Affidavit of Paternity, in case the child was born out of wedlock to a U.S. citizen father who, after the childs birth, married the alien mother.    The Report of Birth fee is $65.00, or local equivalent.    A. Children born in Wedlock  1) Born to two U.S. citizen parents    If either parent has resided in the United States prior to the birth of the child, the child acquires U.S. citizenship under the provisions of Section 301 (c) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. There is no requisite period of residence for the parents in the United States, but it must have been at some time prior to the child's birth.  2) Born to one U.S. citizen and one alien parent after November 14, 1986    The U.S. citizen parent must have been physically present in the United States for a period (or periods totaling) five years prior to the birth of the child, at least two years of which were after the U.S. citizen parent reached the age of fourteen years. If this requirement is met, the child acquires U.S. citizenship under the provisions of Section 301(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as amended by Public Law 99-653 of November 14, 1986).  B. Children Born out of Wedlock  1) Born to a U.S. citizen mother    The U.S. citizen mother must have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least one year before the child's birth. This period of presence may have been at any time before the child's birth. If this requirement is met, the child acquires U.S. citizenship under the provisions of Section 309(c) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act.  The 1966 amendment to section 301 INA allowing members of the U.S. armed forces, employees of the U.S. Government and certain international organizations, and their dependents to count certain periods outside the United States as U.S. physical presence does not apply to section 309(c) INA.  For this reason, the mother of a child born out of wedlock cannot use time spent abroad as a military dependent, for example, to satisfy all or part of the requirement of continuous physical presence in the United States for 1 year.    2) Born to a U.S. citizen father and an alien mother    In November 1986, the United States Immigration and Nationality Act was amended to permit a child born out of wedlock to a U.S. citizen father and an alien mother to acquire U.S. citizenship at birth based upon clear and convincing evidence of paternity. The father must have fulfilled the appropriate physical presence requirements under Section 301(g) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act (ten or five years of physical presence as explained).  In addition, the United States citizen father must:  ? Sign a written agreement to provide financial support until the child reaches the age of eighteen years; and  ? Make a statement under oath acknowledging parentage, or legitimate the child under the law of the child's residence or domicile; or, have the paternity of the child adjudicated and established by a competent court.  C. Burden of proof rests solely upon the applicant(s).     The American citizen parent should bring as much evidence as possible of his/her physical presence in the United States from his/her birth until the birth of the child. School report cards or transcripts, employment records, income tax returns, W-2 forms, social security earnings statements, pay rece|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	If the american parents has NEVER lived in USA for the required 5 years (3 years after age 14) then the child will NEVER be eligible for US citizenship.     sorry but that is US law. Now if she had done the right thing and gave birth to you in USA, then you would NOT need to be asking this question.

Very few Democrats are fundamentalists. This small sub-sect of Christianity focuses on the Old Testament. It does so because that eliminates the message of love, forgiveness and caring Jesus provided in the New Testament. Jesus said he had come to sweep away the old unjust laws; but fundamentalists cling to a few of those to fuel their campaigns of hatred and intolerance.    You'll find plenty of adulterers in the ranks of fundamentalism; either in thought or deed - both punishable under Leviticus. They'll eat shellfish, pork and cheese-burgers (all forbidden under the hygiene rules) and the men will cut their hair and shave, while the women will have their ears pierced for jewelry; all forbidden. However, mention gays or equal marriage, and they hysterically quote the same book of the bible they largely ignore. Ask to buy one of their daughters as a slave and see what they say!

No big conspiracy, no mysterious accomplices, just one, deranged Communist who hated the President.    Edit:  Anyone who says Oswald couldn't have made those shots is not living in reality or has had zero exposure to real firearms training.  Oswald was a Marine.  A normal part of Marine training is to shoot multiple shots quickly at ranges much longer than the Kennedy killing.  I personally have shot drills in training exercises with a scoped rifle involving three shots in under 5 seconds at much longer ranges than the ~100 yard range of Kennedy's killing.  It was not a difficult set of shots to make at all.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	The Catholics and the Mob he would not bow down to the wishes of the Catholic church.|`|Rq2tMCQdaa	no one knows|`|IFVrLCNOaa	officially - Lee Harvey Oswald.

There were many different corrupt institutions out to kill the guy.  When you fire the heads of the CIA, and threaten to dismantle the shadow governments, they get kinda pissed.    Then they also killed his brother RFK when he tried to fill in his brother's footsteps.  Two brothers don't just get assassinated by rogue nuts, the odds are ridiculous.  Sirhan Sirhan was a mind control experiment, he was a set up patsy like Oswald.--Look at the things BOTH of them stated right after the assassinations.  Oswald kept saying over and over, "I need to speak to someone, I've been set up"..  They had to get rid of him.    They also killed Malcolm X, MLK,  John Lennon, and many many other people who weren't as famous cult of personalities who would have come in the way of the new world order/freemason plot....which is now unfolding.    Could you imagine what Lennon would have been saying about the Bushes in the 80's?

Sam Giancanno and the Mafia, Jimmy Hoffa and the temsters, the Steel industry, the cubans. But it was more likely an order handed down by the Federal Reserve and international bankers in alliance with the CIA and military industrial elites. The orders were passed on to the Secret Service to sabotage security in Dallas. You can watch videos of the motorcade where SS men were pulled back from the presidential limosine just as they entered the firing range.  LBJ. being investigated for political corruption was happy to be informed of the plans, since he would undoubtedly soon be going to jail.   There is much too much evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald was chosen as a patsy to elaborate on here. But it is an historical fact that one man is always chosen to take the fall from the crucifiction of Jesus to the present time.  Given the plethora of information and sites one can go to to learn the truth, there is no excuse for anyone to remain in darkness on the subject, any more than there is to continue to believe the government's   9/11 fairy tale.|`|eu7vhkm7aa	It was mainly  a Zionist conspiracy with the mafia and secret service playing a major role.

62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	you have to pay for insurance, and you cannot drive without insurance and you will need either an international license or to apply for or sit the test for a canadian license.     Also licenes are issued by the province, so I dont know if the insurance company will cover you (as a new driver) in other provinces - especally if you are involved in an accident. You will have to contact the insurance company and ask about that.     If you do apply for a canadian license, then you MUST submit an official copy of your driving record, from your insurance company that says how long you have been driving - preferably since the DL was originally issued.      The current licenses only list the date of renewal, not originally issued.     Please remember that Canada drives on the right and it does take a few years to totally get used to it. You are more likely to have an accident - especially if you drive when you are tired.     I know this from experience. I moved from NZ (drives on the left)  to Canada (on the right) and it took me 2 or 3 years to become totally comfortable with driving on the wrong side.|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	I do not know how it works in Canada exactly, but in most countries on earth you must be a resident and proof residency to be able to register a car, obtain the required insurance, or get the needed cards to pay tax for the vehicle.    I do not think that you will be able to buy and register a car just on a visitor status, without being a resident of that country.
cYZTga3Jaa	Hey!     first- congrats on your fiance's great achievement!     second- i live here at ft benning/columbus, my husband is stationed here- and i grew up here. I would reccommend Hotels off of the Manchester Expressway Exit (number 7.) it it right off the interstae that leads you into base. The mall and restaruants are also on this exit. The drive to base from this exit is about 20 mintues.    I would suggest anything off exit number 10 (veterans parkway) as well- although there are 2 different ends to Veteran's (one side in the ghetto, the other side in north columbus)  These may be a little more expensive because they are brand new as well as near Columbus' biggest shopping mall and a lot more restaurants. The drive to base from this exit is about 30 minutes.      here are some links to exit 7 hotels.-   http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/cs...  http://www.lq.com/lq/index.jsp  http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/cs...    and some for exit 10-    http://homewoodsuites1.hilton.com/en_US/...    this is also a good link    http://www.hotels-rates.com/Columbus/GA/...    if you have any questions about the location of a hotel you find feel free to email me- kylie.mckinney@yahoo.com    i can also get you directions from whatever hotel you decide to stay at to the base and other attractions you may be interested in.|`|4c40ef3fb8d468c9d14196c7d81b7a55aa	When my boyfriend graduated from Ranger School last year his sister and I stayed at the Marriott Residence Inn in Columbus.

The German culture is based in a strong leadership culture (it's easy to obey).  The inflation was drowning the country and if you look for pictures, you'll find people with bags of money to buy food.   Politicians always do a lot of propaganda on blaming external factors (like foreigners or just "others") for internal problems and suddenly there was a promise that seemed to solve all the problems: national socialism!|`|pYRZcfsJaa	modern nationalism was out of their desire to rid their country of their nazi image, and have done a good job too, ive heard it is a very nice country. it also had to do with the cold war separation that pulled them together.    ... your question is kind of broad, i would suggest adding a general time span or date so people know what time you are talking about.|`|22tPNksKaa	The above fellow is right, but I must add that the Versaille Treaty was what ruined  the country.

Also, Ethnic Germans were being mistreated all over. They were expelled from alsace, lorainne & Eupen-Malmedy. Plus the Brits kept  the blockade on German Ports into the 20's.

DIlNnjf8aa	If you're in the US, any bachelor's degree will do. It used to be that you had to have a degree in history or political science, but today a degree in chemistry or another science is more likely to get you into law school, because there's a continuing need for specialists in various areas such as patent law.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Working backwards here, you need a law license - to get that, you must pass your state's bar exam, and the multiple choice "Multistate Bar", and then be cleared by your state's authority on legal fitness (typically a division of the state bar).      To take the Bar exams, you must get a law degree (JD) from an accredited law school.  These are typically 3 year programs.    To get into an accredited school, you must have a 4 year undergrad degree - it can be in any subject.  You must also take a law school aptitude test.  Results of these tests are typically evalauted according to percentile - how much better you did than the other people who took the test.    You do not have to go to law school immediately after college - in fact the growing specialization in law means that many are entering the profession after amassing experience with other subjects, typically technology based.    The you do at any stage of the game, the higher you'll go on the next stage.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	First, you have to graduate from college with a decent GPA.  Then you have to pass the LSAT (Law School Admissions Test).  Apply and be admitted to law school.  Do well and graduate.  If you go to law school in Wisconsin and graduate from one of our schools, you will automatically be admitted to the Bar.  However, if you go to school in any other state, you will need to take the bar exam, which is very difficult.  Once you have you JD and have been accepted to the bar in your state, you will have to take the bar again if you move or want to practice in another state.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	4 year degree then law school, then pass the bar.    I have a friend who graduated early from Georgia Tech with a 4.0 (average GPA there is 2.0 and takes 5 years).  He graduated in 3 1/2 years.  He is at the end of his law degree at Virginia.  He has been involved in community service, political activism, plus campus organizations.  It is so expensive so he also works.  I think he sleeps about 5 hours a night.      The stress is incredible.  The amount of work is daunting.  But if you have the determination, you can do it.  You also don't have to go to such a demanding undergraduate college but it helps to get into a good law school.    I say that because you need to think carefully about what your plans will be.  Don't just take the easy way out because it will affect the rest of your career.  Go for being the best you can be.|`|z7hWblT7aa	money and a good  education|`|vGu6bcR9aa	You need an undergraduate degree (BA in pretty much anything is sufficient)    Law school itself is another 3 years. If you're willing to move, Wisconsin and one other state (what it is escapes me) once you pass law school you do NOT need to take the Bar exam to practice there. If you move, of course you'd have to take that state's Bar.

tFVyfvS3aa	I think the only way would be to try and have it expunged from your record..|`|ElvQTpUVaa	If you are innocent of the charge then you should not have pleaded guilty.  By pleading guilty, you allocuted to the facts of the crime - you admitted that there was no factual issue as to your guilt, and you waived your right to trial on that subject.    The only way past that is to have your plea vacated.  This can only be done if you can show that your plea was not knowingly and freely entered.    As a rule, convictions are not made to be reversed, but to stand the test of time.|`|AA11622716	The time to appeal has passed.  Every state has a provision for a motion to withdraw a guilty plea.  In general, they would require you to show that your plea was entered in ignorance of the consequences.  Changing your mind is not grounds to withdraw the plea.  Your new evidence of innocence is also insignificant because if you were innocent, you knew that in 2006 and elected to plead guilty.  So, while you can bring the motion to withdraw the plea, you haven't mentioned any grounds that would lead the court to grant that motion.|`|z7hWblT7aa	all you got to do is get a lawyer|`|pyNNX1ebaa	ya join the army

It is nothing more then using this bill to start social programs that will not be retracted ever once in place, stop any discussion at what is being done or look at alternatives, allow the citizens to judge and select if they want them or not and to disguise the true cost of those programs until it is too late to stop them.  Way too much pork, too many legislative/social programs having nothing to do with the current economic problems and no imminent action to stop it so no immenent doom if it is looked at and fixed before it is passed.|`|qRnXasisaa	I think it is going to get real bad before it get better and at this point i really don't care about the pork in the bill.. we can't sit and wait .. there have to be some steps and measure has to be taken..     We have lived with fear mongering last 8 years and we perfectly know what is that and this is a real threat and it has to be taken care of|`|006931ab45dbadcbf10afb1e4dea8726aa	No and No.    I believe we will pull things together one way or another.  The exact ways and means are still yet to be seen as this problem will take several different approaches.    One thing I am confident in is that the business as usual with large corporations, banks and investment houses will no longer be the usual.      One thing that I see in this plan is that it should help stimulate a local sense of purpose in our communities that will help bring up morale.      Depressions can be pretty depressing.|`|Xzs6X7sZaa	It's a fact. The economy is in serious trouble. This isn't fear mongering, it's reality.    Obama may be approaching the problem in the wrong way, but at least he acknowledges the problem and is trying to do something about it.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Oink oink, baby!|`|aV3bFchtaa	Look, folks bought the tripe Obama spewed during the campaign.  He is riding that wave, hanging crepe if you don't immediately pass his bill.  Same crap, different day.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You mean 500 million jobs|`|P8gGMlbIaa	The Democrats are going all out with the Politics of Fear, they always have along with wealth envy. Nancy Pelosi's crazy comment about 500 million people loosing their job. Are there even that many people in the country? She's an idiot and needs to be removed from office because she is the problem.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	There is a difference between "politics of fear" and talking to the American people realistically.     If the Bush administration had realistically evaluated the sinking economy and had realistically prepared the American people, the request for the $700 billion bailout would not have come as such a shock for many Americans.  Actually, if the Bush administration had been realistically evaluating and handling the economy, we would not have gotten to this point.    You can try to mischaracterize what the current administration is saying but most people realize that we are in very serious economic trouble and something must be done quickly.     As for the so-called "pork," I think the Democrats have designed this bill so that there could be some room for negotiation.  Republican opposition was surely something that they kept in mind, regardless of what the stimulus bill actually contained.
QlbaXYeLaa	I would say go to the Federal State building.. or idk what it is in the UK. ..like somewhere where they handle legal documents. ..and tell them the situation. You must have proff though that he is not the father. Because.. if he is not the father.. how come he is on the certificate? ..So you need proof of who IS the father. ..By a DNA test ...which are pretty pricey. ..and than take all documents and both guys to the bureau or again.. whatever place handles all legal docs. ..and they will help you from there =]      |`|RkfIPD7Iaa	You will have to contact Vital Statistics and apply to make the change.

Thanks GB, for the lovely stress and depression you have caused.|`|eTspmrjMaa	Only the most simple minded of people would believe that Gordon Brown is an economic genius. Either that or they are born liars with and agenda at play. The reason he was allowed to get away with not going to the country was because two years ago almost everyone was making tons of cash and the people thought it couldn't get any worse under Gordon Brown seeing as he was the one responsible for the boom under Tony Blair. People's senses were clouded by greed given that and the fact that there wasn't a credible leader of the opposition ready to take him on, made his transition from budget boy to Prime Minister as smooth and easy as putting margarine on hot toast.|`|wE8NppnLaa	They must believe his grandstanding, huffing and puffing windbaggery on the world news every night.

Even if you could prove that another car was there for longer, and received no ticket, you were still in the wrong.    A ticket may have been issued to the other car, the owner of the car might have removed it before you saw the ticket ... or it could have blown away.    In snow country parking regulations are important during the winter months!  It's almost impossible to clear a parking lot or road if cars are in the way.  You can try to appeal the ticket, but you will probably wind up paying the fine anyway.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Get real mad and walk into the deans office   .

Other wise it would be the custodial parent. It would be good for him to talk to the mother of the child to see whether she is claiming the child.

Maw2rtKZaa	Yes, there are many immigrants in the military.  In fact, it is a path to citizenship.  If you serve 1 year you are eligible for citizenship instead of the normal 5 year wait.  However, in a time of war, as we are now, any service in the active duty military qualifies you to apply for citizenship.     The non-citizen soldiers in our militarys fill a vital part of our services.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Just another immigration law that is ignored.|`|8fa967c1b5f3cca6f2fb5e744f6c7c01aa	My husband is from russia, he is bilingual in Georrgian russian and English, he is vital for the military b/c he is a translator.

emNCaAq7aa	In the US only where they are policing other military. The US Constitution and the beliefs of the country keep the military away from having police  powers unless there is a specific emergency that calls for a temporary ban on rights.    Hawaii has no state police (no 50, Dano), each major island is a county and most of the policing outside of major cities is done by the county police.  Off the top I can't think of another state with out some form of state police. The form may be different, say in Wisconsin where the old State Patrol only had police powers on and very near major roadways, but they are a state wide police force. Many states call their state police Troopers instead of officers.|`|qwaWd14vaa	No state police?  State troopers are the states police.  Also the National Guard is the state Militia and become by decree of the Governor the states police in a national Emergency like Katrina.|`|e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	The military cannot serve in a law enforcement capacity.  They can provide support to law enforcement, but they cannot be used to make arrests or serve search warrants.    I don't know of any state that doesn't have a state police agency.|`|EMk4iBEOaa	Its against the law for the regular active duty military to act in a police capacity inside the united states.

Those who would claim they do have NO IDEA about SCRIPTURE, PROPHECY or HISTORY.

There's a chain email making the rounds making absolutely RIDICULOUS claims about Obama being the AntiChrist, and that has absolutely NOTHING to do with scripture in the Bible.

I am in agreement that the government needs to stay out of the business of companies that are doing well and NOT asking for a bailout, however, if it's my money that is being used to fix this company then I don't want it spent on some high priced executive that isn't doing his job.

I have absolutely no qualms about  letting these guys get paid a trillion dollars a year if their work was successful and they remained privatized but as soon as they needed the government's help, they should forfeit their "private" salaries since they are, technically, government sponsored.  Until they pay off that TARP debt, it's fair to say that's the way it should be!  (You may want to redefine your idea of "talent", too.

In the civil rights era the boycotts were due to discrimination.  One of the most successful and well noted was the Montgomery Bus Boycott for which Rosa Parks is given credit as the face of the protest.  However, the NAACP carefully selected her as the "poster child" for the discriminatory practices that required Blacks to pay the same fare and then proceed to the back of the bus and/or relinquish as seat to any white person if the bus became standing room only. They knew she would be arrested and archived photos of her arrest are part of the success of the event that marked one of the most successful campaigns of the civil rights movement.      Organizers also created car pools and other means of transportation for Blacks who needed to ride the buses.  National coverage helped add pressure to the law makers of Alabama to stop the discriminatory practices.     Getting media involved through press releases drafted by the organizers stating when the boycott will begin, why and what the resolution points would be are also involved in making a boycott work. Rallies, press conferences and the strong will of the people involved will add pressure to a company or organization to make the issue right for its consumers.|`|PkLUIhZiaa	people+promlem+soulution=boycott|`|3c8b8822457ec1d8d0804fe44a312e7daa	A boycott is when a country or group of people refuses to buy goods or trade with another country or group in order to wreck that groups economy.|`|9653a537f24f65ac8a46a27607f0d7dcaa	A boycott is a form of consumer activism involving the act of voluntarily abstaining from using, buying, or dealing with someone or some other organization as an expression of protest, usually of political reasons.      The word boycott entered the English language during the Irish "Land War" and is derived from the name of Captain Charles Boycott, the estate agent of an absentee landlord, the Earl Erne, in County Mayo, Ireland, who was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880. In September that year protesting tenants demanded from Boycott a substantial reduction in their rents. He not only refused but also evicted them from the land. Charles Stewart Parnell, in his Ennis Speech proposed that, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should refuse to deal with him. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolatedhis workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as the house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail.    The concerted action taken against him meant that Boycott was unable to hire anyone to harvest the crops in his charge. Eventually 50 Orangemen from Cavan and Monaghan volunteered to harvest his crops. They were escorted to and from Claremorris by one thousand policemen and soldiersthis despite the fact that Boycott's complete social ostracism meant that he was actually in no danger of being harmed. Moreover, this protection ended up costing far more than the harvest was worth. After the harvest, the "boycott" was successfully continued. Within weeks Boycott's name was everywhere. It was used by The Times in November 1880 as a term for organized isolation. According to an account in the book The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland by Michael Davitt, the term was coined by Fr. John O'Malley of County Mayo to "signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott". The Times first reported on November 20, 1880: The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink. The Daily News wrote on December 13, 1880: Already the stoutest-hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'. By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: "Dame Nature arose.... She 'Boycotted' London from Kew to Mile End" (The Spectator, January 22, 1881).    On December 1, 1880 Captain Boycott left his post and withdrew to England, with his family.|`|b52zvfGMaa	A boycott is a form of consumer activism involving the act of voluntarily abstaining from using, buying, or dealing with someone or some other organization as an expression of protest, usually of political reasons.    In other words, a bunch of people get together and decide they will have nothing to do with a certain product(or whatever else) because it's part of something they are strongly against. In doing so, they hope to have an effect on the company(enough people stop buying the product, company loses money, they're forced to do something about it). Pretty much, you have to hit them in the wallet to get their attention.    I hope this helped a little. Always check Wikipedia.com, they have an answer to just about everything ;).

Smoke for the children!|`|u23sBafTaa	Just another way that the liberals use to take away people 's rights.  What they don't get is that they will pay for it also.  My son was a manager in a large grocery store for awhile, it is near the low end of town,  the busted more shoplifters stealing cigarettes and booze than anything, so in the long run your cost goes up to cover the thefts .If people stop smoking they will find something to tax you on trust me,the wrong kind of car, the pop you drink they want to nanny state us to death !    Buy the way never smoked myself still believe in there rights !|`|0ZM8wsgFaa	Cigarette taxes aren't CHOSEN taxes... you don't have to buy cigarettes.    When you any person files for their taxes they aren't taxed for smoking.  That's stupid.  It the purchase of the item at that particular time (which is COMPLETELY voluntary) that is taxes.
jh9iPYvXaa	There are 11 states where it's illegal to leave a child in a car alone. The law in California states that you can't leave a child under the age of 6 alone in a car unless there's someone 12 or older to attend to them. You'll have to bring them into the bathroom with you - I'm sure you'll be stopping on the way.    Also - safety is much more important than the law! It's not that they'll fry in the car while you're using the bathroom, but what if one of them climbed into the front seat and put the car in gear? Or if someone broke into the car and carjacked all of them. Just be careful about it...|`|z9st8cLvaa	You better just plan on making several bathroom breaks along the way anyhow, and all go together.  I'm sure you could stick out an 8-hour car ride w/out using the restroom, but I guarantee your kids won't be able to!|`|Zn7NNavKaa	i know it's a pain but you should take them all with you. would the 9 year old and six year old probably be ok, yes. but what if...  to many kids go missing. to many kids get touched. i heard a story of a little boy getting raped in a public library bathroom with his mom two book rows away. the whole incident took something like 3 minutes! better to be safe than sorry.    there is always adult diapers  lol|`|76nTvO4iaa	You're taking 3 children on a road trip that usually takes 8 hours and you believe that you're going to get there in 8 hours?          Dad, plan to be stopping about every 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  If you limit the children's fluid intake, they will need to go less often, but they're going to need to get out and move around.  Fortunately, there are lots of rest stops on the highways these days.  Make use of them when they're needed.    Plan to leave early in the morning.  Relax and take your time.  Keep your sense of humor  This is a great opportunity to make memories with your children.     Good luck and have a safe trip.

Its 40 years worth of pet projects and political payback for the dem's supporters out on the left coast. Californication and Washington state are getting the biggest slice of the pie. And though some of the items sound useful in concept or title, in reality the majority of the thing is just temporary 'feel good' spurts of money into dead end pork projects.   Even if every job (few that there are, as it is) was created, it would be 4 years from today at the cost of over $200,000 per job. And you can bet that ain't the salary for the position.

The more we take the more we depend on democrats to keep the money coming.  What can we do?  Contact your senator and your congressman.  Write e-mails, make phone calls, write letters let them know that you are watching what they do.

In reality a VERY SMALL part of this bill is actually going to create jobs. A HUGE part is going to other "pet" projects that will never get passed unless it can be hidden inside something else. The longer it takes to pass the more people are able to understand what is in it and truly see how much the gov is trying to get away with.|`|noo8vpvzaa	You got it right    They wanted to hurry before anyone read it...More people are reading it now...That's why it's being held up    This Democrat speaks out:    Cooper, one of the 11 Democrats to vote against the House version of the stimulus bill, said he landed in hot water with Pelosi because he cared what was in the bill.     "I got in terrible trouble with our leadership because they dont care whats in the bill, they just want it pass and they want it to be unanimous," he said. "They dont mind the partisan fighting cause thats what they are used to. In fact, theyre really good at it. And theyre a little bit worried about what a post-partisan future might look like. If members actually had to read the bills and figure out whether they are any good or not. Were just told how to vote. Were treated like mushrooms most of the time."    Listen to him speak in this audio clip...He goes into much more detail about it:  http://townhall.com/blog/g/0942a241-8c6f...    Basicly, Pelosi tells them "Don't read it, just vote yes"...And then she yells at them if they don't do what she says...This may be why so many Democrats can't understand why we are opposed to it (because they don't know what's in it)...It may also be why they keep saying they only need 2 Republicans to support it, because they expect (or have ordered) all of the Democrats to vote for it.|`|up40wvywaa	Pay backs, or pay offs.

The GOP presidential candidate, John McCain, co-authored the amnesty bill with Kennedy. GW Bush tried to push the amnesty bill through the Senate. Yet now it is somehow a Dem issue??? C'mon...    I laid out a plan to have the majority of illegals self-deport with the hope of coming back as a legal immigrant someday.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	I would have expected our elected officials (local and federal) to have said times are hard and we will have to make cuts, They will be difficult but we will be cutting medical welfare and education to all illegals.    Then we will look at what we have to do after that.      That is what I and I am sure others would have liked to have seen done.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Republicans objected to the "Buy American" provision.    Maybe they objected to this, too?|`|lRmhwiYpaa	because the illegals are soon going to be made legal~it is the next thing~along with their free health care|`|8SdnCGxIaa	Yes! me too!

gUhvARDdaa	According to the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, all powers not delegated to the federal government by the states (in article 1, section 8) and not prohibited to the states in the Constitution (in article 1, section 10) are reserved to the states or to the people. Thomas Jefferson held that this principle formed the very foundation of our Constitution. It was the guarantee that the experience Americans endured under the British would not be repeated, and that political decisions would be made by their own local legislatures rather than by a distant central government that would be much more difficult, if not impossible, for them to control.    Executive orders were rare in the 19th century, for a president to issue even several dozen was unusual. The first 20th century president to serve a full term, Theodore Roosevelt issued over a thousand. His distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt issued over three thousand.    The Bush admin has very often used the signing statement as a vehicle either for expressing the manner in which the president intends to interpret certain provisions of a law (often at odds with what congress obviously intended), or even for making clear his intention of not enforcing the provision in question at all.    I fully support these states in there endeavor, and hope that my state will take heed and follow suit.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Not much.

Because they all graduate from states that can't.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	I think it's fantastic - true to the Constitution - and I certainly hope that the rest of the States follow suit.  If not, you will see the tidal wave of complete government control flood the country until it is no longer recognizable.  It is the only way to stem the tide of socialism that is gushing forth from Congress and this (and prior) administrations.    And I don't even care if the states are 'liberal' or 'conservative', red or blue - people have the right to choose and do not need to succumb to a 'one size fits all' government mentality.|`|JBgOyOhfaa	you forgot N.H.'s State Motto...."Live Free, Or Die"|`|AU70o6wTaa	with them 100%. for too long the states have given up rights to the federal govt and it's about time they took them back. a large federal govt is a dangerous thing and will be self fulfilling and take away all our rights. it's just the nature of the beast. we should all vote for smaller govt weather it be Dem or Rep, or we will lose this country to the very powerful that can control better with one large entity.|`|AA11620976	As much as I personally admire Thomas Jefferson I know exactly how fortunate we are that we we don't live in Jefferson's vision of America .and that we live in Alexander Hamilton's vision of America who as we all know was a Federalist  We would not be here if lived in Jefferson's vision of America  For all intents and purposes the Tenth Amendment became an anachronism when Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox ....... and properly so  What made us so great after the Civil War was the changing of one little verb from the plural to the singular form   In four years we went from The United States are one country to the United States is one country  Had that important change not happened then I really think  that we would have followed the European model and had an on going series of endless pizzz -azzz But deadly little wars between our individual states and regions|`|1ymL5LKlaa	It's great.

AND, I think the more you rant, the more you're proving our case. Why do you protest the observations made by those older, wiser and more capable of perspective? We're not looking to deny your fun, but we all have experiences with pot smokers that don't necessarily concur with your, more limited ones.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	"I like how it relaxes me and makes me very happy after a stressful day."    That effect is a double-edged sword, the euphoria you feel is related to the neurons in your brain slowing down or shutting down, repeated use can permanently disable them.    MJ has a terrible effect on short term memory and impacts learning while under the influence, specifically, if you learn something while high it is harder to recall it when sober and vice versa.    It can work wonders for glaucoma and MS, that's a good thing.|`|SS1VReF0aa	The dumber you make yourself, the less competition I have when trying to advance myself.    I'm a finance major, I'm perfectly aware of what DECA is :)  Good for you, that is great. Let me point out that there was a time when smoking cigarettes was considered healthy. They later found that it causes lung cancer...of course that could not be determined until long term effects were studied on smokers.    Even if it you are correct and it does not affect you directly...I have seen more than a small number of my friends waste their lives because they would rather lay around smoking pot, spend all their money on pot, and focus their lives on pot...sounds pretty stupid to me.|`|b43pJxNEaa	I would much rather have a pot head on the road next to me than an DRUNK!|`|5SCMfucFaa	I used to smoke it until I realised it made my nights out really boring. It has also made a lot of my friends boring as even when they aren't high they only ever talk about getting high. The average stoner humour goes something like "The other day I smoked this really big joint *raucous laughter.*" It also got a lot of my friends into other drugs which they would have probably never started if not for weed.   Basically, getting stoned occasionally is fun, but being a full-blown stoner makes you incredibly uninteresting to talk to.|`|YbkgqKUqaa	The effects are largely dependent upon who's doing the smoking. Some people can function perfectly on marijuana, some people develop a psychological addiction very easily.     It does have various medical purposes, and the criminalization of it is just ridiculous, but I'm not going to say it's inherently "good" or "bad." It does bad things for some, good things for others.|`|ndhg5TbBaa	look, it's ILLEGAL. that's a bad effect.    i don't know where you have gotten your information on "there are no proven links that is actually bad for you", cause you are SO wrong.  marijuana affects short term memory the most, which you do need.    if you're a straight A student, i think you should care about your future. considering you can go to jail for this, you'll throw your life away. so if you're soo smart, you should have some common sense to not do DRUGS. AND you're VERY selfish. you have NO idea what you are ruining.    lets give some examples.    'Marijuana not an appropriate medicine' says FDA  "the harmful chemicals and carcinogens that are byproducts of smoking create entirely new health problems. There are four times the level of tar in a marijuana cigarette, for example, than in a tobacco cigarette"  "Legalization of marijuana, no matter how it begins, will come at the expense of our children and public safety. It will create dependency and treatment issues, and open the door to use of other drugs, impaired health, delinquent behavior, and drugged drivers."    heres something to disprove your memory statement.  According to two studies, marijuana use narrows arteries in the brain, "similar to patients with high blood pressure and dementia," and may explain why memory tests are difficult for marijuana users. In addition, "chronic consumers of cannabis lose molecules called CB1 receptors in the brains arteries," leading to blood flow problems in the brain which can cause memory loss, attention deficits, and impaired learning ability"      HERE'S THE BIGGEST REASON YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT.  "Researchers at Cardiff University (Stanley Zammit and colleagues) found a connection between frequent pot smoking and psychosis, schizophrenia, hearing voices and hallucinations. People who haven't smoked pot are less likely to display the same psychotic illnesses."    The British study found that frequent pot smokers (daily or weekly marijuana users) were 50 to 200% more likely to experience psychosis. Your age and genetics also affects whether marijuana will trigger a psychotic illness.    "even infrequent use could raise the small but real risk of this serious mental illness by 40 percent."    "200% Higher Bipolar Risk when you use Marijuana"    THE ONLY REASON YOU GET HIGH IS BECAUSE IT IS UPSETTING THE CHEMICAL BALANCE IN YOUR BRAIN. THUS, CREATING IT POSSIBLE FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!    ---i have bipolar disorder and ADHD.---by genetics.  it's been a long 4 years dealing with BP, after the 15 manic/depressive episodes in total, i've stabled out. my life is great now, but i have done many many bad things that screwed up my life because i was soo out of control the first year. i didn't even know what was going on half the time. i can't tell you how fuckingg lucky you are. that you have a healthy mind. i'd give up EVERYTHING i have for a cure. i'd do ANYTHING for a CURE. but right now, all i can do is take my medication for both disorders, and hope that stem cell research and gene therapy will someday make it possible for me to be normal.     see, you have a chance to decrease your risk. hell, i'm afraid my newborn nephew will have what i have even. even though i'm only 17, i'm afraid to get married and have kids. i'm sure i'd be a good father, but because of what i have, i might pass it on since it's recessive.   so all i have is just a medicine bottle and my ever growing strength to help me balance out the monsters within. but it's not easy, if you keep doing that shitt, you'll understand where i'm coming from.    i am positive what i say about how it affects mental health won't stop your dumbasss from being a CRIMINAL and being a stoner...unfortunately. but just warning you. you're fuckiing wrong as hell. you have no idea how fuckiing LUCKY you are. i don't give a crap about your accomplishments or your grades, you're still stupid because you're SELFISH and DISRESPECTFUL TO YOUR BODY.    i promise you, you'll get a mental disorder sooner or later.  and when that happens, you'll be sorry and regret what you've done.    and please, tell me how many stoners do you know who DONT go from being intelligent and talented before smoking, to STUPID and sloppy? i bet very few.     so, you're also wrong about the intelligence.      just STOP being a criminal. you aren't going to get hired from anywhere with a felony on your record.

AU70o6wTaa	what they say is true, but I believe it's more than confidence. looks to me our problem began when we created the federal reserve ( or should I say they created themselves). then they started running all the main banks of the world. they put out so much phony money that it just caught up with them hence, the economic breakdown. I don't think it's just wall-street but large banks in other countries that we have to bail out. if it were just us then why are huge sums of money leaving the country and the fed won't even say where it's going.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yes.

For those defending Obama, here's the problem.  He said he was going to bring hope and change.  He said he was going to shake up Washington.  He said he was a new kind of politician.  So far, he has proposed and tried to muscle through a BAD stimulus bill that spends confiscatory amounts of money that will in no way stimulate anything but the donors and special interests that helped get him elected.  He has appointed several people to his administration that failed to pay their taxes.  Clearly these are bad decisions.  He promised that no lobbyists will be a part of his administration, but so far he has appointed 3.  He signed an order to close Gitmo with NO plan as to what to do with the detainees.    I don't think people were expecting miracles in two weeks, but were hoping for some level of competence.  So far he has looked out of his depth and overwhelmed and has really gone against many of the things that got him elected in the first place.|`|UuyCVr3Taa	Hopey! Changey!    Oh noooooooo!    Samey!

RFEorR5Raa	Pelosi is in charge of the so called stimulus package and has her and the liberals christmas wish list that they couldn't pass the last forty years.  it is a sham and it is being perpetrated on us, the tax payers.    Nancy Pelosi seems to be taking exaggeration to another level. On January 18th on Fox News Sunday, Nancy Pelosi stated that 500 million jobs would be lost unless Obamas stimulus package was passed by Congress. Chris Wallace corrected her, stating she probably meant 500,000 jobs. Pelosi responded in her own defense, It feels like 500 million. The population of the United States is 303 million, Ms. Pelosi.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVl2nqjLV...    This is worst than the 57-58 states Barrack spoke about while running for president. It goes to show you that they just make this stuff up as they go. There are less than 350 millions of Americans adults and children. She is not even close.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDA0QRz1J...    democrats has the majority of votes to pass this and do not need republicans but they want republican to vote for it so blame can be 'shared' for the failure.  they do not want to take the blame exclusively.    this is the only thing that i agree with pelosi on.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59q8waklX...|`|WgruZkHRaa	the architects of our destruction|`|JthubNIsaa	Let's hope the GOP is able to strip out the lard.

Lincoln didn't free the slaves after all|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	I do not think reparations are appropriate.

Remember, that a lot of the really dangerous work was done by indentured servants mainly Irish because they were expendable.|`|7IVEMAg8aa	There should be no reparations of any kind.|`|e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	If they are looking to start a race war, then yes, they should institute reparations.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	The slaves were freed in Southern States before they were freed in the Northern States.

And it is certainly likely that though African-Americans have been disadvantaged, they are better off than if their ancestors had remained in Africa.    Perhaps a replay of Liberia would be an alternative.

I don't see in these "Rights of the child" the word fetus. Therefore your theory is based on nothing.     A child is a baby. A child popped out of the woman's womb. If during the first 9 months, the woman stops eating, I guarantee the fetus will die. If the mom dies, the fetus dies. It's the same person until the baby gets out!!!!    How can't you see it? I know how. Your unique source of info is the Bible and you don't even follow its guidelines. The bible is very clear ... a fetus is a "non-being", not a baby in the bible. Lots of you guys should go back to school, even bible school. Reading is the right thing to do!!!|`|AA11103371	Nope.  Balls of cells aren't children.  Kids in poverty who need SCHIP are.

It is not ok to put murderers and rapists to death - that is against their 'human rights'  And if a murderer or rapist attacks you it is not ok for you to defend yourself.  To this end they have conspired to ensure that no-one may own a gun.  (Oh horrors)  The result of this defective thinking of course is that only the criminals own guns.  The old testament book of Jeremaiah makes it clear that God knew the prophet whilst he was still in the womb and before he was born.  Of course we don't expect that the 'liberals' would have actually read God's word.  No need to guess where their doctrine originated, but here is a clue.  It was not in heaven!!!!

SOme even have problems with the pyramids and other ancient sites because of they are pagan in origin.     I don't mean Egypt and Israel are friends or that the Egyptians are against the Palestinians altogether, but since the Camp David Accords in the late 70's there has been peace, maybe uneasy peace, but peace between Egypt and Israel.    I think Hamas is a terrorist organization and even if somebody is in favor of a 2 state solution, Gaza under Hamas is really a third state, the other two are Israel and the West Bank.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	and thennnnnnnn?|`|bFLP6COgaa	What does this have to do with liberals?

When it is the government that tells the banks who to loan to. The banks were mandated to make the sub prime loans by Federal judges and acts of congress. One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.

acWyJ3t0aa	For years now , we have heard nothing but how Bush screwed things up for the last eight years , and maybe you are right , but the bottom line is that Bush is no longer even in Washington , The Democrats would not even consider backing Bush while he was in office and now they practically beg , bully , threaten , whatever they think it takes to make the Republicans back Obama.  It is plain stupid , no one in either party or in any office even attempts to think ubout the ones who put them where they are , us , the American people .  Whatever happened to gov. of the people , by the people , and for the people. Now it is whatever is best for those that eat at the Pork trough and that includes our very own president . What a sad state of affairs our country has come to.|`|CM1dfztQaa	He doesn't need anyone's help, he is failing just fine on his own.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Clinton cleaned up the mess after twelve years of Roinnie & Daddy, unfortunately junior's mess after less than eight years is much worse.

But not nearly as badly as we will suffer if we don't put a leash on their goal of Socialism and this horrendous excuse of a bill designed to pay for their pork projects and political favors.    Closing Gitmo with no idea of what to do with the terrorists and spending nearly $1,000,000,000,000.00 (lotta zeros, ain't it?) on crap that has little or nothing to do with "stimulating" our economy for at least a year is close to criminal.

One more thing, people need to get off this partisan bickering crap - OBAMA, BUSH, AND CLINTON are all globalist pawns, actually working toward the same globalists' goal.    You are not seeing the forest for the trees!  Clinton and Bush were just as guilty of paving the way for a globalist takeover of the US as people are blaming Obama.    People like Rush and Glenn Beck don't want to see the country sold out to globalist banksters who are implementing their socialist agendas in the US, and have been for YEARS!    America is going to fail no matter who is president, and it is because of what the former presidents have done, so get off your bickering butts and do some research!  This partisan fighting is just a tool that the globalists are promoting to take your eyes off the real issues at hand - the de-sovereignization of the US, and they're using their puppets in office now, Obama, Pelosi, Reid, to just finish the job that Bush/Cheney and Clinton began.|`|PDYdcSliaa	They're unpatriotic at best, and to those flying the stars and bars, they're traitorous.

Bush failed the world basically and hes put us in such a hole that i dont think obama can actually fix it.

The Republicans seem to be fighting Obama every step of the way.  Our government has always been like this, where one party will do everything in their power to make the opposing party fail.  Times are different now with the seriousness of our failing economy, and it was time for Republicans to put their revenge tactics aside, and do what's best for the people of this country.  Apparently the Republicans aren't capable of doing that.  Shame on them, and the voters who voted them in.|`|PhTQn6ycaa	Funny how all these republicans will say we wanted Bush to fail because we said we thought going to Iraq was a bad idea. Yet when one of theirs says he wants Obama to fail, It's too much of a stretch to say he wants the country to fail. For the record, we wanted Bush to succeed. All we said is going to Iraq wasn't the way to do it, and we were right. You guys stretched allot farther then we did, that's for sure.|`|AA11928155	This coming from the party that chose sides with Iran and communist China over Our Country because they hated Bush so much?|`|YTJ5Upneaa	He is doing quite well failing all on his own. This bill he proposed is nothing but payback to those who got him elected, it's full of useless government spending that will not help in real job creation. When it costs 100 billion to create 75 jobs, how does that help? I did not vote for Obama(and now I am even more happy that I did not) however, I do want him to succeed , because our country needs to succeed. However with what he has done so far, I have serious concerns, and as an American citizen I have every right to voice my concerns. So far all he has done is ensure that our tax dollars will pay for abortions, promised to close gitmo, which shows our enemies that he is weak, and propose a bill that is more pork than stimulus.
t3QAaSN9aa	Obama's been on the job for a little over 2 weeks and yet there are all of these dire predictions as to his future rep.

He's done a lot -- but you have to realize you can do the wrong kind of "a lot".      His pig bill will cripple the Dems.  It's now 925 Billion -- Growing?  I thought he told Lauer during the Super Bowl he was going to cut out a big portion of the bill.      Says one thing -- does another.    The bill's support lies @ 40% and is falling daily.      If it passes, the Dems are doomed come 2010...no doubt in my mind.    They put together a budgetary spending bill and cloaked it in "stimulus" w/ a giant urgency symbol stamped right on the side.  It's a shame they couldn't shotgun it through Congress as it gave people a chance to read through it.  You didn't have to go any further than page 12 of 246 to know it was a farce.    Directly lied to the constituency and got caught with their pants down trying to put us on the hook for 1.3 Trillion dollars.  And they tried (try) to pull it off during a time when our economy is in shambles...corrupt wolves in sheep's clothing.  Like I said -- done come 2010.|`|7fXuH1R3aa	He's been in office for 3 weeks...are you out of your mind?|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	I have not seen any accomplishments yet.

He actually has had one of the worst starts in history.  Bush only had one cabinet member that was forced to withdraw, and she withdrew because she allowed an illegal alien to stay in her house, something that shouldn't even concern the Democrats.    Obama has already had 4 withdraw, plus he had to scurry around changing laws so that Hillary and a few lobbyists could be on his cabinet.    So, not sure how you define success....unless it is simply not dropping dead, like Harding.|`|LZw4JntHaa	Your question makes me laugh.

This has been the pattern of American politics for at least 100 years; the GOP makes a mess, then hands the mess over to the Democrats to fix all the while whinging and carping that we aren't fixing it quickly enough. Then when the mess is finally fixed, they campaign on a "aren't you tired of all this burdensome government interference?" platform and idiots with short memories vote them in to make yet another mess. As Mr. Jefferson said, "I reflect that God is just and I tremble for my nation."|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	lucky for you...Dems have both the exucitive and legislative branches...and they are both off to the lowest approval ratings ever (check out rasmussen).

B07sKfdvaa	No...most conservatives are desirous of substance.  We are not impressed with dog and pony shows.

After that, I may at least start listening!|`|SEwG8Yl4aa	The cost of the current "stimulus" bill is $900B.  That becomes about $1.3 trillion when you add in the interest costs for borrowing the money.  Let's take Obama' number of creating 4 million jobs.  That means it takes over $300,000 to create each job.  Seriously.  Now you tell me if that makes any sense.    First Obama needs to get Pelosi under control and knock off the garbage.  Come up with an actual stimulus plan.  Not something that creates pork and more entitlement programs that will continue in perpetuity.  If the situation is as grave as Obama says he is he should start treating it that way and get rid of EVERYTHING in the current bill that does nothing to stimulate the economy.    Oh and btw the only proven way to stimulate the economy is through tax cuts.  JFK did it as well.  Never in the history of our country has huge government spending stimulated the economy if that was the case we wouldn't be in the situation we are in today.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	Well he could start by using his brain and listening to the people.

These people are real dodos stuck on the failed policies of the past and they are going to stick to it even as the ship of state and country go down.

Most people are unaware that before that great saint of conservatism, Ronald Reagan, took office that the United States was the largest lender nation in the world,and the largest exporter of manufactured goods.Since Reagan and his insane policies we have become the worlds largest debtor nation and the largest importer of manufactured goods.Our largest exports are raw materials which is also what third world countries export.    Most people don't know that Ronald Reagan borrowed more money than all previous administrations combined to finance his efforts to maintain a propped up economy that would make the uninformed voters of this country support the lie of conservatism (remember Dick Cheney saying that Ronald Reagan showed us that a deficit doesn't matter)    Most people don't know that George W.Bush wanting so badly to be another Reagan topped Reagan's deficit by again borrowing more money than all previous administrations.    Republican policies put us in this mess,and unfortunately we have to throw money at the problem to solve it.Very much like you have to throw money at a health problem.|`|AA10604086	Welcome to the Republican Party!

The House impeached Clinton because he had commited an unspeakable act.  He lied before Congress.  The Senate was mostly a partisan vote, and frankly that doesn't meet the stink test.    Most Americans took it for what it was worth,  Clinton was a low life scoundrel, this could no longer be denied.  To be dis-barred was an even further indignity, but he just ignored it all and pretended it never happened.  How socialpathic is that?

In that time, two things about weed struck me.  The first is it is the drug that addicts most commonly seek out addiction treatment for.  The second is a hell of alot of mentally ill people who came through our facility had no history of mental illness before they started using drugs.  When they stopped using drugs, their mental illness would typically go into remission.    What was the number one drug they used?  Weed.

Legalizing marijuana will not be a popular idea for the DEA, FBI, DOJ, state law enforcement agencies, or the prison-industrial complex. All of them have their grubby hands in drug law enforcement, and would only lose with the legalization of drugs. Sure, by legalizing them, it would take power and money away from organized crime, but it would also take power and money away from the government too.|`|60ApQsGOaa	yes. Definately. It's impossible to overdose on marijuana (unlike alcohol poisioning or emphazema from ciggarettes). The side effects from weed nothing to be worried about. The fact that there IS a side effect is what people get all freaked out over. Hungry, happy, sleepy. That's it. There are no (and you can look this up if you want) marijuana-related deaths in the US. Unlike overdoses from other heavier drugs. Marijuana isn't (or shouldnt I should say) be considered a drug. If you could smoke the grass that grows outside..they'd change the name from a plant to a drug. It's insane. Plus it would boost our economy greatly. Just think, plant a couple seeds, help the enviornment, help the economy, help the anorexics, everyone wins|`|2JqajMgeaa	I completely agree with what you are saying.    It also puts the Government in more control of the sources of the weed.    Perhaps it should be trialled!|`|Q5zIzEQGaa	Other places have it legalized and they are able to function without anarchy. Alcohol used to be illegal too.|`|92784b46bd958aceb50aeff60a4f90deaa	You don't have to legalize it... just decriminalize it. If you look at the difference between the US and Canada, you'll see why the US method of enforcing pot laws just doesn't work.    In the US if you are smoking or caught with a small amount of pot, the police arrest you. That later means you go to detention, go through bail hearings, have a prosecutor and (possibly) a public defender assigned to you, then a trial, judge, clerks, witnesses, police having to take time of to testify, etc. Even if convicted or you plea to a lesser charge, most often you get a small fine or suspended sentence as the jails are full. Even if given jail time it costs thousands to keep someone in jail for a few months and they are more likely to come out involved in hard drugs. In reality, the police likely won't bother even arresting you for usage or carrying small amounts because they know the system is already clogged and likely won't really do much. And of course most folks know this and don't really worry about it.    In Canada, the police just give you a fine then and there. It works like a speeding ticket. Few people fight it, it pays for the officer's time, it doesn't clog the courts or jails, and it provides an immediate deterrent. If you smoke pot anywhere public you know that if the police see you, you aren't going to be let off with a warning - since it is really no trouble to hand out a ticket. Serious offenses such as trafficking, growing, distribution, operating a motor vehicle under the influence, etc. is still illegal so the police can still arrest serious offenders.

Those are expensive and a necessity.  Where does it stop?    \  Bad things happen.  That is life. Hard times come and tough decisions have to be made.

For my 45 year old coworker, a private policy $485/month not including her son and that was roughly half what the COBRA payment would have been.

We couldn't afford to pay that NOW with both of us working, let alone if one of us lost our job.  In what world is $1200 a month a reasonable option?|`|USoqyjaAaa	Find a high-deductible policy.  Mine is about $120 with a $5000 deductible, with Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  It was much less than COBRA, though of course the COBRA policy would have had a much smaller deductible.  Also though you will be responsible for the amount up to the deductible, the insurance company should be negotiating lower prices with the hospitals. It is important to continue some kind of coverage as you will at least limit your out-of-pocket expenses to your deductible amount and ensure that you have continuous coverage.   If you have a break in coverage, you may not be able to buy insurance later if you develop a medical condition in the meantime. If you know your situation is temporary (i.e. need coverage between jobs) a temporary policy is often even cheaper, but not designed for long-term use.  It is an good choice for recent grads between school and work too.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I honestly believe that if a person *wants* health care, as they do other insurances, they will find a way.

There are still people who live by their means.

I think we will have at least another 2 years of job loss.  If that money does not get into the welfare system, we are doomed.

But my premium is just $230/mo.|`|ZKgqQfwRaa	Wow, $1,200 a month, you must have had really awesome coverage with your previous job.  My COBRA was $600 for me, wife, and 3 kids and that was higher than most people I know who have used it.  I know COBRA matches your insurance you had with your employer and the better coverage or higher cost insurance you had, the more it will be.    But like the other person said, emergency services can not refuse treatment so it's not like you're going to die just because you have no health insurance if you're a somewhat healthy person.    $1,200 is crazy though and I would suggest shopping around for a higher deductible and lower coverage policy to save $ rather than pay that crazy high price.    As far as being laid off, I hope things work out for you.  My suggestion for everyone is to make sure you're keeping your family in mind as top priority and not depending on anyone else whether it be an employer or the government as your only chance of filling needs.  Keep a backup source of income/tradeskill and work hard to keep your job secure and company profitable.  Too many people get in the groove of a 9-5 paycheck not planning for the "what if".|`|k7gV4QBOaa	COBRA is very expensive to have especially when your low on finances.

Adding to the fact that scientist could uses those stems cells legally, they just had to pay for them themselves.   Obama is an idiot and apparently so are the ignorant fools who refuse to do their homework.

What moron leftist told you it was illegal? Because that's a lie.    The facts are:  1. Bush was the first president to federally fund embryonic stem cell research; but he limited it to ongoing lines of research only. He was not going to use federal funds to pay for the destruction of embryos for scientific reseach.    2. All other stem cell research was also funded, and continued to be funded: adult, placental, blood, etc.    How can you post such uninformed questions?|`|AA11993638	You do realize that the greatest advancements in stem cell research has been through the research that was not blocked in the form of adult stem cell research, and the type that has actually shown no promise up to this point, embryonic stem cell research was merely blocked for federal spending?

It's already being done.. letting live human fetuses live as long as they can and destroying them,  Like in immoral evil crap nations like China:  Who take prisoners from work camps, throw them in the back of a mobile surgical truck and do a live vivisection of their organs to sell on the black market.     I think why not take it further and start harvesting organs from babies and small children in goo chambers.    Scientists are already genetically cross species animals,  even HUMANS with animals/insects.  Why not just make the entire thing legal so the scientists don't have to fear reprisal if they accidentally let loose genetically mutated viruses or biological microbes which set off a chain reaction which destroys all life on earth?

I think that if women have the right to do it then why don't we have the right to do the research to save a life. I hope that stem cell research helps people because what else do we have to fall back on, I don't see the cure for any thing yet! So we might as well give it a chance.|`|1778b52a6dfa7f556791c3baa059ce9aaa	yes i am. we can now save some lives.|`|5wej1TKDaa	Sure, I believe Ron Reagan would've have done the same thing, it's a great study that can potentially help many people.

I quit smoking several years ago, l but I had to start again.  The tax money goes to children's heath care, If You do not smoke You are killing them.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	My cig tax is now $36 per month.  I have already cut down by 1/3 from prior usage.    I will cut down again by 1/2.    Your taxable proceeds will be reduced by $18 per month.When I quit, you will lose  a total of $36 per month.

"As a Heritage Foundation study calculated in 2007, to produce the revenues that Congress needs to fund SCHIP expansion through such a tax would require 22.4 million new smokers by 2017.    http://www.heartland.org/article.html?ar...|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	I think we should add a new tax to alcohol due to the health risks and accident risks. People with drinking problems have many health issues too. I work in health care and see people on state assistance and medical that have bad livers, bad hearts, blood pressures problems and then yes there is that issue with drinking and driving and killing innocent people on the road everyday. I have not heard of many that smoked a camel and killed a family of 4 on the highway. And then there is the issue of the obese, The also have health risks that tax payers flip the "medical" bill  on.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Taxation without representation.  More people will be growing there own smokes.  Gotta have something to settle my nerves, because of the Democratic Government we have now. If the government wanted to do something about it ,they would make a nerve pill to replace nicotine that would not harm our bodies as much, but I guess they need the tax to fuel Nancy's jet.|`|s9WG4NaPaa	I think is time I quit to smoke|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	it's not going to make people stop......people will pay out the nose to get what they want....doesn't matter if it's cigarettes or gas.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	excellent, my wife smokes and I smoke on occasion.  I HATE cigarrettes, it's not easy quitting what is arguably the most disgusting voluntary habit plagueing the human race.  please let it fund children's health care.  it's a great idea.  cigarrettes should be phazed out of popular use.|`|VyLXMBtcaa	I'm paying for your health care GET OFF MY BACK    EDIT    Or I will take part in the 207 mill in the Stimulus Package set up for stop smoking programs!!!!|`|70YyELYxaa	they will hate it and scream, but I think it's fair. Also, I think they should tax junk food, heavily tax, as it's a cornerstone of health problems in our society. Almost as bad as smoking. Just an opinion.

t3QAaSN9aa	They can't.  They talk fiscal responsibility and then do just the opposite.  Apparently they have to admit that Reagan, Bush I and Bush II were Republicans but they claim that they weren't "true conservatives" or some such other evasion.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Perhaps, you should pay attention to figure 5. That should answer your question.|`|d307fbd26168d0aae54b1779f57e62e1aa	I know, let's top it off with a borrowed trillion dollar "stimulus" package.  That will make it go away.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	They can't.  Tax cuts may have helped the economy, but Congress and republican administrations outspent the economy.  End results of this are coming to fruition right now.    Not a popular sentiment on answers, obviously.  Deficit spending is not the cure all, it is just a postponement of the inevitable downturns inherent in our economy and increases the severity of these downturns..|`|LROaxvV8aa	If Bush hadn't given all those billions away to his friends we wouldn't have this problem.      Don't blame me.The Republicans gave it away and now the Democrats know they can get away with it.The American People were/will be used in both cases.|`|2FsiTlb5aa	YES!  Only Republicans are responsible for the DEBT.  Democrats have NOTHING to do with it.

Yes the Pres tries to get money and "asks" for it, but to place the blame on one person is irresponsible politics|`|rXTsIWDTaa	well look atthe economy prior 2006  and post 2006 , we  were the majorty vote when this all started exploding, and we werent giving houses to people who couldnt afford them|`|Eu5KD4l6aa	First off, if you think this a one party problem...you clearly have little knowledge about the debt and it's history.     Secondly, if both parties had chosen to pay off the debt (remember congress appropriates money) then we wouldn't be where we are today.    Finally, your credibility is challenged when you use a user-created page that has a total liberal bias. Even when the charts show that R's lowered or maintained, they don't get credit.|`|8091157cce079beb55128deba743200caa	The blame for the national debt is neither the democrats or republicans fault. It's both. This partisan blame is a bunch of crap. Bush did bad things to the national debt along with Clinton, Carter, and Bush senior and if Obama gets his way the national debt will sky rocket. How will a 920 billion dollar loan save this country. Not only that but the stimulus bill won't even take effect until 2010,2011, and 2012. If the country is in such dire straights like Obama claims, then why not come up with a more immediate relief plan. Preferably something that doesn't include taking billions of dollars in tax payer money.|`|d5RbVpnRaa	I admit that the Debt and Government has increased in the last (Bush) Administration. Can I assume that you are a Democrat? I ask that because the Democrats historically have absolutely NO room to talk, especially with Obama as the President. The last Democrat (Clinton) over taxed us into paying for his Government. Were you proud of his balanced budget? You should, you paid for it!|`|2FA9qNHzaa	What I want to know is how you justify Clinton leveraging Social Security, Medicare and the DOD in the name of a "balanced budget".  See, the elderly and disabled will lose their entitlements because there is roughly 45 TRILLION in unaccounted deficits.|`|AA11847612	There is no scapegoat.

It isn't one or the other, its both.  Both parties are absolutely corrupted.  There are individuals within both parties that good, honest people.  they are just out numbered.
Vpq8CZQHaa	I understand and agree.  Not too long ago, I needed a little help.  Not dependency on the government, just a rough bump in the road.  I was not able to get help, it was denied.  My intention was to use the system as it was intended, as a little help in hard times.  But I found, as a US citizen, those that be in control of who gets what seem to favor those who will do nothing or little to help themselves over those who have paid their taxes for years.  I see the billions spent on aiding illegal aliens, the scam artists, those who love the welfare state and all others who have figured out how to milk the system to the point those with legitimate needs are left in the dark and yet still expected to be productive taxpayers supporting those who do not or will not.|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	Medical coverage will be available to anyone who has a tax identification number.  ITINs will be accepted.  And I agree, We pay all the money into the system, but we are the ones being denied help. There is no help for US taxpayers, certainly not from our government anyway.|`|qZ1wEDPpaa	See how fast Obama signed it after it was passed.??? Less than 3 hours.. When has anything in the history of our government been done that quickly?... The Democrats brought the bill to the floor without committee meeting or mark-up.. They completely slammed the door on anything that the Republicans could of added to ensure the money was used by citizens.. I dont understand WHY we have so many sheep out there.. Did I miss something? Do people just want to be taken advantage of?|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I think is is nice that illegal pregnant women get coverage as well as all illegal children and a family making $88,000 can have free coverage Share the Wealth..elections have consequences and we were screwed by a hypnotized uninformed  electorate.  Hold on it's gonna get more costly|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Schip isn't for those who have fallen on hard times - that is how it is being marketed - it is just another step towards socialized medicine.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	Don't get me wrong, I don't think everyone should simply get schip, only those that need it as a last resort. It should only be for citizens and only for those trying to improve their situation. You ask why you should help and my best answer is because it's the right thing to do. The alternative is watching innocent American children suffer. We should help each other. I feel for you not having insurance Henry, I'm in the same boat. I had an infected back tooth pulled a while back because I couldn't afford the filling or regular dental trips, I also couldn't afford insurance. It should not be that way. We've paid into the system and should atleast be able to be healthy.  I also agree that illegals should not get anything and the milkers should be cut. The people who deserve the benefits should be getting them, not those that come here to sponge off of our country or people who simply don't want to work.
a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa	I think you got a bad bit of info.    The current news report is that three of the Pirates were killed by US snipers.    That's a rescue!

These people are hypocrites|`|pGuC0FOBaa	No, she was "forced" to ride on the tax payer jet just as the GOP House leader before her rode in a taxpayer funded jet. Since she is third in line to be POTUS, for national security sake, she is supposed to use the military plane. Should the POTUS give up Air Force One?     More right wing propaganda from the pointy heads, Pelosi didn't ask for a bigger plane, but since former Speaker Hastert came from Illinois and Pelosi from California, she needed the bigger plane to go the longer distance safely and at the military's insistence.|`|AA11369432	Yes, She should.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Hah! Giving up things is for the little people to do, not for the Masters of the Universe like her or Al Gore|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	No,,because only Conservatives can cause the global to warm.    Liberals are in-tune with the environment, and the greenhouse gases emitted from her jet, are absorbed by mother nature, in order for Nancy to continue her quest to save the world.    Global Warming is only a problem when a Republican is driving.

And the public is already starting to become restless after realizing that their newly elected Emperor is wearing no cloths.|`|AA11593583	I'd sooner think it's because they would like to have a good chance of getting re-elected in 2010.     After all they will have authorized the President to spend $1.6+ trillion dollars in less than four months and won't have anything to show for it. Even Democrats can't justify increasing the national debt by over 15% that quickly. Bush's average rate of increase was .5 billion a year. With Democrats controlling Congress they have tripled the amount in just a third of a year.    It's not talk radio. But the press doesn't want to do what Obama did yesterday and say, we screwed up. So they have to blame someone else.    It's also people saying what they said in 1994. This spending has gotten completely out of hand! Democrats just got back control of Congress after twelve years out of power. They don't want to do 'four and out the door'.|`|B7qO5CsYaa	No one is supposed to question the "divine One" least of all fellow democrats. I don't think Rush has anything to do with it. I think the American voters are finally yelling loud enough for DC to hear|`|NJqCAdVraa	he allowed it so common people or CEOs could meet in a single view.  So if a CEO with billions of bonuses and jets have a chance face to face with a family man who lost his job and his house. thats the idea of his transparency and his opponents are taking advantage of it against him. sick sick sick|`|6Z6qXhPXaa	It is partially the Republicans fault.    There is not a clear and articulate leader in Congress and thus no enemy for Obama to vilify Maoist style.    So..... Obama has to turn his propaganda weapons on a private citizen; a disc jockey at that.    It would be laughable but it is far too important.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	Because talk radio hosts usually bring out the worst in everyone.|`|DBIKou8faa	Yes, the worst possible scenario has unfolded.

Be happy.|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	Because talk radio is telling everyone who listens just how much pork is in this b.s. they are trying to push down our throats.  They don't want an informed public they prefer us all to be ignorant of what they are doing.|`|u23sBafTaa	Because Americans aren't as stupid as the democrats think!  They have heard enough that most are starting to read this thing and see it for what it is !   They can blame who they want but the blame goes to the greedy Democrats in congress trying to pay back all their buddies for favors !|`|nr96BgWfaa	We all know his package has been a joke from inception so, if they want to 'blame' Rush or, anyone else on the right, for its failure (true or, false), I'll take it and hold my head up high!    I say, good job, Rush!|`|mdHqr17kaa	because they are following policy of the Ministry of Information    BRAVO "ghost of hung hugely"  great answer|`|Oh1Hi8iMaa	Because they refuse to take the blame for anything. Americans are waking up and realizing just how much it's going to cost them personally.
93ef3d401a54c624311fba3ba86648bdaa	I would guesstimate, that most of the people who lean to the left anyway, just think the media just thinks like they do, and think there is nothing wrong with the media as it stands.    I watched this last election, as the media attacked everyone on the right side of the room, and gave BO so many passes, I often wondered if the election was already over, and I just missed voting day.|`|OlcC4hwcaa	media is about reporting news, if you don't agree with how it is reported, well thats your problem|`|pGjD5TTxaa	ok...have you ever thought that they maybe arent leaning to the left they are just reporting the facts...so greatfully most of the media finds fact more informative than fiction...republicans seem to think if your not in their mind thought now your unpatriotic..i mean come on|`|DBIKou8faa	I realize it.

Its individual bias, just like you and I have, that is in the news.  There are conserative members in the media and there are liberal members in the media.    its an individual bias (which is briefly touched on in the study) that exists.    That being said, typically the more educated you are the more likely you are to be a liberal.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Because it doesn't; although most right wingers think that anything which is not part of their echo chamber is leftist or even communist.  In this they are mistaken.|`|AA11928155	They realize it. They just like it. It's sort of like a drug.

d307fbd26168d0aae54b1779f57e62e1aa	President Obama is OUR President, not just yours.  A mark of a good leader is the ability to listen to a variety of experts and then make your decision.  I did not vote for President Obama, but will acknowledge that he appears to be keeping an open mind when it comes to major decisions.  That's the only way he will not be a huge failure.  So, if you are truly concerned about YOUR President, you will support him as he works with both parties and tries to find the best way to get us out of this financial fiasco.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	It's not Obama's bill, but Pelosi's.

So that could mean they will be liberal on some days and conservative on others and perhaps socialist on others. Pure masochist also vary between whether they are turned on by being dominated by their own gender or by the opposite gender to themselves or by either gender. So their politics as submissives is likely to be controlled either by the gender of the politician or by the orders given to them by their dominant. As many masochists get their sexual pleasure with the cooperation of their dominant spouse before heterosexual intercourse while others just enjoy it when all by themselves by DIY sex from fantasies or past experiences at work or wherever, it will probably mean whatever the dominant orders is what they feel they have to adhere to.|`|shtP63traa	The more reserved and conservative they are in public, the kinkier they get behind closed doors.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	conservative,liberals tend to be submissive.they would be to worried about human rights to see the fun behind it.|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Typically they are supporters of Hillary Clinton...

Putting of the Blue to put on the red.|`|supRA4eOaa	After seeing the treatment of Hilary and Palin this past year, I'd say masochists are equal opportunity.|`|bIp7m1qMaa	Could be either coz I am advised that a masochist enjoys erotic pleasure from being defeated and humiliated by others, or from others being successful and happy as a result of their own failure or unhappiness. So they are likely to give support to whatever political organisation is most likely to lose. This may vary from election to election.|`|viD4WZAdaa	I enjoy a light whipping now and then from my wife and I detest politicians across the spectrum.

FKJaQXQLaa	We are the smallest of all the Armed Forces.  Average size is about 170000-200000, depending on the world situation.  In times of war the ranks usually swell.  The rest of the branches of the military have 2.5 times the amount of personnel each.  That is why we are called the Few.    We are also Proud because we ARE the best.  Think about this.  If you had a hill you needed to take and asked the Army to do it, they would have to wait until they had tank support, artillery support, air support, medical support, food and supplies before engaging the enemy.  Tell the Marines to take that same hill and we just charge on up with what we carry on our backs and with our buddies at our sides.|`|IRGQNs4gaa	I dont think they are. I think war is a racket, and the marines are suckers.|`|eJK3EWRlaa	Because it is the smallest  military force (coast guard not included) therefore the few, also it is a lot harder than any other branch to complete intial training. If you go to marine boot camp and u switch branches, u dont have to go to the other branches boot camp, but if u go to the army and then go marines you have to go through boot camp all over again. and they are pround because the marines are full of themselves ......lol i can say that because i am a marine, but really they have espirit of the corps. meaning they will always defend it no matter what have lots of emotion involved with it. as compared to other branches|`|dSbAz63baa	civilians especially marine girlfriend stay off these forums, your answer is of a perpetrator.. Real training begins once you reach your first unit - NOT boot camp. To answer your question, because their a smaller branch.     marines have no special forces,  force recon no longer exists and now has been formed into marsoc. This is special operations - NOT Special Forces and only a small percentage of marines actually become one. So marines are the best of the "basic" : )    marines run 3 miles to complete boot camp, Rangers run 12 miles, take a 30 second water break, pack on 60lbs and hump 10 more miles *daily* See the difference in bad ***?    If anyone consider marine boot camp tough their not ready to become a Ranger or any Special Forces|`|P3e2kJtwaa	Because there aren't a lot of them, and their title is something to be proud of.

They go through more training that you can imagine.  Army can have their cell phones on the weekend.  Marine, you are cut off from everyone. The only way you can contact is through letters.      I saw this bumper sticker one day  "If everyone could join,  they wouldn't be the few, the proud,  the Marine."|`|eCGg94HJaa	Amongst the Royal Marines & the Parachute Regiment, they are known as The Clowns, which kind of sums up their standing outside the USA|`|Vrdw9gccaa	it's because marines are a department of the Navy, they are one of the smallest forces but are one of the strongest in the world. It is deffenitly one of the toughest jobs to have. My husband is a marine and 13 out of 60 people in his platoon at bootcamp didn't make it. ( just to give you a real number becuase all these other people are arguing)    I hope this answers your question|`|XYTUAzzgaa	because they usually never make formation and are proud enough to call in and tell their first sergeant why.

I could see Obama justifying this.      I understand that it's just those companies receiving TARP money, but what about other companies/organizations that receive federal funds?  What about presidents and coaches at universities?  What about companies that get government contracts, do they fall under this umbrella as well?  If not, why not, it's the same justification?

The $15 billion pay to the UAW retirees health coverage (life long worker and family at home) which drives up cost with no benefit to the current employees should be paid back.  This is why the UAW "sacrificed" taking it over-it is paid in full through at least 2015 and by then I believe and so do they that President Obama will get his Universal Health Care so the program will be dropped and the retirees rolled into that plan-so what will happen to the excess funds left?  Since the UAWis not a "business" they could divert the money to their own use.

What got us into this mess was the housing collapse, which had absolutely nothing to do with tax cuts.  Banks were forced(by the government) to give loans to people who couldn't afford them.  And then those loans were sold as securities around the world.  Then bets, for lack of a better term, were placed on them.  Once the loans started defaulting, the bets had to be paid off but these companies didn't have enough capital on hand to pay them off, so they either went under or had to find a way to raise capital.  They started laying people off to raise capital.  More people lost their homes, and the cycle repeated itself.      Tax cuts have NEVER got us into any kind of mess.  The real problem is too much government meddling in private industry.      Here's how we get out:  Cut the corporate tax rate down to 10%, then watch business boom, which will create jobs for people  Eliminate tax withholding for 2 months, which puts more money back in people's pockets.

The problem was all of these interest only loans that people where getting a few years back.   Tax cuts would work. 5% across the board tax cuts for every one.   6 month advance payments on all outstanding mortgages in the country, this would catch many up and offer a huge amount of available founds to home owners.   6 month credit card minimum payments and reset all rates down to 6% for the next 2 years.    citizens could use time to pay down debt or spend.     Tax credits on flex fuel cars, solar panels and solar heating.    $3,000.00 tax credit on day care for the year.    raise the rates on use savings bonds to 6%.|`|s9WG4NaPaa	there is a reason why we are in this mess nothing in this country happen just like that|`|LZY9yDIfaa	I agree with you.  I see a lot of ranting against the current stimulus package but very little with regard to alternatives.  The GOP members claim to have an alternative but they spend almost no time laying it out.    Why do people think "consumers will get us out of this mess"?  Consumers are NOT SPENDING, business is NOT SPENDING.   Job losses continue to mount.    This is a world wide problem...its not just the US economy.    Economists on both the Left and Right are calling for a government stimulus that includes significant SPENDING.

If we cut some of that spending that isn't needed, and provide decent tax cuts it could work. But it'll get paid off eventually.

Besides there are plenty of empty homes standing idle at the moment, whilst the homeless are left freezing in the snow or living 6 to a room.      I'm sure that they would soon find a party donor to redevelop affordable housing into luxury appartments, like the current government has been doing since it got in.    The BNP official policy, should any misguided person believe it,  does not include forced repatriation of legal immigrants.     What they are arguing for is     "the introduction of a system of voluntary resettlement whereby those immigrants who are legally here will be afforded the opportunity to return to their lands of ethnic origin assisted by a generous financial incentives both for individuals and for the countries in question"    http://bnp.org.uk/policies-2/immigration...    They don't say at what time period they are fixing ethnicity to country.  Do anglo-saxons get a grant to go and live in Germany?  Which country do Romani go to? do they get a free choice of any country from Ireland to India?  What happens to mixed race families? As for the Jews, I daren't ask?    If the BNP knew their history then they would know that there have been some Africans living in Britain since Roman times. There were African soldiers who settled and of course Roman emperor Septimus Severus, a black african from Libya who died in York. Does that make them native?

The U.S government borrows money from China and the currency converts over to dollars, but not only funds are borrowed but stocks are also involved during buying and trading.  The U.S government lost it's power back in 1913 when president W.Wilson signed a bill that privatized the banking system and the federal reserve was born.  Every time the government borrows money from the feds it repays back with interest and the cycle continues.  The funds used to pay back this loan is from" income tax".  The government debt gets bigger creating inflation, weakening the dollar power and crippling the government.

Fade off into the distance like a respectable person instead of making a fool of yourself Joe!  I am not fed up with Democrats, I am one... they have been way more open to being better people and admitting mistakes, and crossing the lines than Repubs ever have been.    Do Repubs dream about Reagan when they sleep?|`|iNQK27Qqaa	wow the libs are thick in here..... the dems are just so stupid, no joe the plumber his 15mins were over a long time ago. But hell yea they need to kick ***|`|G6yyceAxaa	sad is the day that a plumber without a license, who owes back taxes, and lied about owning a plumbing company becomes the spokesperson for the republican party.    anybody can say, go get em!    don't hear any advise as to how to solve our problem with the economy, only whining about what is being done.|`|DibFrwxlaa	I don't care what Joe thinks.    The day I work as a plumber in rural Ohio, I may.|`|supRA4eOaa	I agree with the idea, but he has been so damaged by the Media (unfairly)- it's hard to take him seriously.    Oh well, it drives the Left crazy!!!    GO JOE!!!!|`|KUnDQfBGaa	Who's 'Joe the plummer'? Does he actually exist?|`|wQ5LKysaaa	A blue collar dude, using his blue collar lingo; 85% of America is saying the same thing around their dinner tables.    Translation for Obamanots:  He's keepin' it real, ya'll.    Go Joe!    Mr. Olan:  LOL, Your description of Joe makes him sound like an Obama Cabinet appointee.  Now, that's funny.  I don't care who you are!|`|pvgI8X6Caa	Good advice from an American that stood up to Obama. Joe has eaned the right to speek out and tell it like the folks believe.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	I have no idea why anyone would spend a second of time listening to this nobody...|`|3fa6f56441b907487541819a03872781aa	Bill and everyone else who says Joe is "not a real plumber": Do your research guys. Joe IS a plumber (or was before he came into the national spotlight by giving Obama a question that was too difficult for him) who is not required have have a license of his own because he WORKED FOR ANOTHER PLUMBER!!! He was planning on taking the test necessary to acquire his own license have his own  company... WHICH WAS ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE POINT OF HIS QUESTION to Obama in the first place!!! But leave it to Liberals to know all their facts before they talk out of their ***!     Plus, if the Democratic Party is supposed to be for the common man; then why are they attacking a hard worker like Joe who has fallen upon hard times? After attack on Joe is from the left. This is NOT the same as Obama's nominees who deliberately tried to deceive the IRS.     And in those three words Joe spoke more sense than the Democratic leadership for the past two years.
AA11166769	Well, it's not as if Obama is just running around in his sweats, wearing a wifebeater, and scratching his butt! I think that he looks professional enough in business casual attire and I also think that he carries himself in a very professional manner.|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	I could care less about someone wearing a tie and shirt in the oval office with no jacket.....i want the work to be done.  I don't care if he was naked..lol.|`|AA11388462	I think the oval office should be respected.  Turn down the heat and wear your jacket, you represent us.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	You will NEVER see a CEO walking around a company without a sport coat on, regardless of what of the week it is.  As the CEO of the United States, it is only proper to dress the part.  This is only one more way in which Obama shows his lack of respect for the country in which he serves.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Business in general is becoming more casual.  Card needs to get with the times.    Someone in my position 20 years ago was required to wear a suit and tie, now I wear jeans and a polo shirt with tennis shoes most days, without anyone in corporate whining about it.    Lh T: LMFAO!  True, true!|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	sounds like your typical uptight, out-of-touch rich guy.    Wearing a suit and tie doesn't make you work any harder, more efficiently or perform any better.    Everyone used to wear a suit and tie to work, it didn't change anything.|`|PDYdcSliaa	I don't care.  Anything is better than the empty suit that had the office before him.      Jason, having worked in coporate america for a couple of decades, I've seen lots of CEOs without jackets.      The president is getting down to business, jacket not required.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	The issue is not the cloths he is wearing.     The real underlying issues is the fact that wearing no jacket, with a collar open and sleeves rolled up indicates that the office thermostat is turned up too high.     Don't forget Obama has asked all Americans to help conserve by turning down their thermostats.     Obviously Obama's office being warm enough to grow orchards indicates that Obama is not willing to do what he asks others to do.     Obama has asked common Americans to sacrifice but he himself remains exempt.   He gets a pass.|`|QC94lBXOaa	My husband's company just laid off another 16 workers Monday. Our neighbor's house is going into foreclosure because they BOTH lost their jobs last fall. Our heating bill has DOUBLED since November and we still have at least two months of cold weather.  I don't care if Obama is wearing a$$less chaps and a hat full of fruit like Carmen Miranda.|`|g9VVQEbPaa	Sounds like a meaningless distraction initiated by the left.    No one cares about this stuff so the left keeps bringing it up.    It's called a Red Herring and it's a damn clumsy one.    Now lets talk about this ridiculous porkulus bill and how morally reprehensible it is.    Issues my good man, issues...|`|6jErufVYaa	He talks like that's the biggest problem we have right now.|`|AA10586974	Barry Hussein is acting very unprofessional.|`|AA10302860	Well, you should wear your suit while you're pissing all over the Constitution, I mean...Bush at least showed some respect.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	Because Andrew Card needs to really stretch to find anything to make his criminal administration look better.  Yes, the Bush admin. was more concerned about perception then substance.|`|5Ho518J9aa	I don't know about you, but investor's money isn't entrusted to slackers with their feet on the desk, especially when this clown has never run a lemonade stand! The culture of irresponsible business is what led us here. Put the damn coat on, Barrack.|`|DBIKou8faa	It may seem fuddy duddyish, but I don't think that showing respect for the office is an unreasonable thing, we aren't talking your usual work place, it's the White House.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	I think there are more pressing issues than what someone wears to his office.|`|ma0u2CUNaa	cool calm and collective|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Who cares? This has GOT to be the silliest complaint I've ever seen.    Major Deek:  Card was a BUSH staff member.  How is this from the LEFT?
AA12279950	Hang on I'll just check my crystal ball ... hold on ... yup it's gonna last for at least another 42 days.
T2zD3FS6aa	Yes. Any irregularity in the weather, no matter how slight, is caused by global warming and proves that it exists.|`|GFdppnFHaa	Yes, and it's also causing all of these blizzards, ice and snow storms and cold temps.  So they're telling us.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	Take an ice cube, put it in a glass of water, stir it around, what happens?|`|fc0b719eb616ba86e30fd23f51659547aa	To answer your question, I would need to explain equatorial currents, the El Nino Southern Oscillation, water density differentials, and the significance of nutrient upwellings on phytoplankton productivity.  There is no simple explanation for why part of the planet heats up or cools down (but waas up does a pretty good job).  The very  complicated, inter-related, dynamic process of global weather patterns HAS changed over the past 200 years, and one might reasonably assume that the industrial revolution and sudden use of fossil fuels might be the variable that has shifted our planet.      Whether you think humans caused it or not, the climate is changing and it will affect our lives (in the form of more severe weather: droughts/floods, tornadoes/hurricanes, etc).  So we can fuss and complain and point fingers forever, or we can shut up and do something about it.|`|3nqyxHrgaa	mabby if global warming was real|`|Souvww0maa	Global warming is responsible for everything.    Record cold temperatures?  Global Warming.  Record Snow falls?  Global Warming  Growing arctic ice?  Global Warming  Volcano Melting a Glacier in Alaska?  Global Warming|`|bmCInR5qaa	Perhaps that's due to the melting ice caps.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Nope.    Global temperatures started cooling in 1998.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	Yes it does.|`|2Hlctljgaa	No, but the reduction of sun spots could be a cause for oceans to get cooler.  We apparently had this same condition about 400 years ago.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	That's what they say. I don't believe this has as much to do with global warming as it does with natural cycles the earth goes through every so many hundreds and thousands of years. It has been proved that the earth has gone through these very cycles before and that was before pollution. I do agree that pollution may speed things up slightly but it is not the only factor as all the green happy fear mongers want us to believe so they can sock million of our tax dollars into their little studies.
THRtsl83aa	The ones who don't support the libs' cause are evil traitors to them.|`|ZTbgOgqgaa	K-Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-S-I|`|nTzTIrataa	I don't get my facts on global warming from weathermen.    A better question is why do deniers latch onto statements made by Scottish Members of Parliament or the founder of the Weather Channel, or a petition signed by any scientist with a bachelor's degree in anything from economics to political science?|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	climatologists...not meteorologists...    damn|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Not all scientists are created equal. You have wackos in any profession.    So the people who should be respected are those who have built a solid reputation in their specialty, with review by their peers. Those that chose to not believe in global warming are not respected in their professions, so should be ignored.
i790R5DXaa	Well, he said " I will hit the ground running"...    So far he just hit the ground...    Not very impressive.    A:~)|`|2WfHLUyOaa	dont hat him...certainly dont like his actions...if i was american i wouldn of being fooled by his properganda..and i hope the american people have braced themselves for the next four years....cos huni there gonna be alot harder than they have to be and for one reason only..because obama will make it alot harder|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Not very good.|`|AA10206116	I try to avoid thinking about him.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	too early to tell for sure but I dont like 90% of what Ive seen so far. Its only been less than a month though.|`|bEeozqacaa	He is great presidential choice. Obama is a great speaker and he has great choices for the Americans. I am disappointed that some people hate him, but they love George Bush.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	To soon to tell about Barack Obama    All he has to do is deliver something and we all will cheer him on    I know it is going to hurt in America for a long time and a lot of people    are going to go without but what don't kill you will only make you stronger    This was the last generation in the US that will be able to RETIRE    the next generation? I don't think it will be so nice for them|`|qusKbEmBaa	Uhm he seems like a pretty decent positive guy, he is kinda inexperience. but overrall i like him :D|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	I think I was right about him from the beginning and many other people are also starting to realize this. I also think that he needs to take a step back and take a look at himself from the outside and maybe start listening to what others are trying to tell him.|`|XbsDGhmNaa	I don't like his stance on abortion so I did not vote for him. However, other than that, he seems to be doing good so far. I don't think he's going to be as bad as some seem to think and we all need to respect him because he is our president.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	He is a saint to our country. He is very charismatic and seems to really care about our country because he got right to work the day after the inauguration. I would definitely vote for him again.  America made a good choice.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	I feel sorry for him...well, I feel sorry for anyone that works for Nancy Pelosi...what a 8itch!    I think he really wants to do what he thinks is right ( though misguided )...but his party has been hijacked by the extreme left.  Im sure that his legacy is very important to him and that fact that he is the first black president just adds so much more weight to that.  He is trying to be bipartisan but his own party wont cooperate......    I did not vote for him ( or mcLame ) but I believe if he could fire EVERYONE of those lifelong entrenched crooks we call politicians and start over with term limits for new ones, he would do an okay job.  However he got himself in the middle of old grudges and feuds that have been going on for decades.      If things fall apart...blame the 2 parties that are bickering ( yes I think more of it is the dem's ) like spoiled children.....If he manages to change anything with those selfish idiots I will be shocked.      DEMAND TERM LIMITS FOR EVERYONE IN DC!!!  thats the only way anything will change|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	I agree with his self-assessment: Obama is a screw-up.|`|uu6JYenAaa	He will keep the ACLU very busy for a loooooong time|`|7sivs9y2aa	he's got a mean jump shot and sucks at bowling. he is awesome|`|HvXIy6Taaa	He's a wonderful chocolate man 8-)|`|PwjxhDAXaa	i agree he is awsome|`|EONXaXYEaa	Good public speaker, good father, as a president though, my opinion is a work in progress on that.|`|ZXr8BSRyaa	Sucks    Blows    Over his head    Above his paygrade|`|8CereM2vaa	good and bad, I know he has a good heart and will do good things for our country but I also worry that he will let the terrorists out of gitmo and the will go back to the middle east and make terrorist groups stronger and more deadly.|`|sGWBjnRraa	he goes to work everyday, unlike the last pres.,  thats a good start.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	I voted for him, and so far, I'm not really happy about his performance.    unless he changes the way he has been operating, he will be out in 4 years|`|UZBULUuraa	I think he is the least qualified to be in the White House in my lifetime. He is going to have to learn on the job and I don't think that is what we need now in these hard economic times. I think he is in way over his head and sinking fast.
a0v3q3J4aa	I think he is a sociopath|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	hes an idiot.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	he makes for good comedy!|`|LMPK5WBaaa	not much..|`|G6yyceAxaa	I think that he basically did the same thing as Louis the 14th.  when asked about the state of affairs in france he replied Le,stat c'est moi. or I am the state.    Old Rod felt that he was above the law, like lots of powerful and rich people, and as such acted accordingly.|`|mBXu5G5saa	That is an ugly as man and a waste of sperm!|`|AA11765933	he and the Governor of California should have a contest who is the worst elected official in all the land|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	This guy is stuck on stupid.  The Feds have been watching him for several years and he apparently was unaware of it.    It would be difficult to sell the seat of an obscure senator.  To try to sell the seat of a now former senator as prominent as Barack Obama is insane.  And to talk about it on the telephone is crazier still.    I think Blagojevich is going to face some serious prison time.  Maybe he would be better off in a mental institution.    I have only heard snippets of his comments about selling Obamas seat, but it did not sound like he was joking or it was just talk.|`|e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	He's a goofball.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	I think he has a serious mental disorder, such as megalomania.  There's just no other way to see him.  It's like he has this image in his mind of what he is and what he wants to be, yet he isn't that in reality.|`|NJqCAdVraa	hehehe when will he realize he is just a tool. i thnik he doesnt even know whos using him.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	I think he is hliarious -- and I cannot wait until that little birdie sings!|`|AA11166769	I think he's a crook who's either dumb or crazy or both. Why else would he talk so openly about his activities when he knew that he was under investigation and that his phones were probably tapped?|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	a pompous ****, who just ate a does of humiliation|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Typical Illinois governor..|`|SWkaGJpgaa	I think he was impeached and removed only because he exposed the standard level of corruption that invests politics.    I hold this position because not one of the politicians who he tried to extort personal gains from blew the whistle on him. Why not? Because this was the standard operating procedure for any and all politicians they had dealt with.    He was dealt with harshly and rebuked because he exposed them, so they had to manufacture some "outrage" and take lest the voters catch on.|`|YKPN1444aa	He's a dildo.
t3QAaSN9aa	I don't know but an op-ed piece is just that, the opinion of the writer.  I don't see the imaginary disturbing problems that you are trying to concoct.     A president should use whatever means available to get his opinion out to the public whether it is television, radio, the Internet or newspapers.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Aha! There's someone else who caught on to that little cookie!|`|DBIKou8faa	Yes, there is something odd about it, but not when you take his personality into consideration.    I don't hate the guy, I think he's naive, and unprepared for the task.  I've always thought him to be a bit of a narcissist and this bolsters that belief.  I would read what he had to say.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Yes. Why is it disturbing?  Its no different that giving a speech that is reported by the media.    The paranoia on the Right is getting out of hand...|`|mkMJYIJOaa	his way or the highway--obama will strong arm whomever he has to to save face on his crap bill...    I am reminded of the GREAT orator--Shakespeare who said:" I think that thou doth protest too much."  We're not buying obama's lies--and he's going to force us to be persuaded--but the smart ones will see through his subterfuge..|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	sitting Senators, reps, etc do it all the time.    I don't see how this is a problem, unless you'd rather your President limit his communications and thoughts he shares with the people.    Liberty, how is this "manipulating the media"  Seriously?  he is putting his thoughts and plans in writing.  I think you're more shocked that a President would actually do this for some reason.  its a bold move and he is putting his ideas and thoughts out there for everyone to read that wants to.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Would it make you feel better if it was printed by the Washington Times, NY Post, or Wall Street Journal (conservative papers)?    I have no issues with the President using whatever means necessary to get his agenda across.   Doesn't mean that people are going to support it.    edit: LIBERTY4EVER- in case you didn't notice, Bush used Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and every other conservative talking head to spout GOP-approved White House talking points for 8 years.      You always knew when a new talking point came out because every talking head parroted the same 1 or 2 lines ad naseum.|`|D0KZiRBbaa	I do not know...but I will try to find an answer.      And I agree with you...it is disturbing at multiple levels.  Impartiality is lost when you think you can pander to the President and he might offer an op-ed which can help in the sales of your newspaper or publication.    **EDIT** Caldude...that wouldn't make me feel better.  Still, it WASN'T in any conservative paper was it?  If the Executive office or the Government can manipulate the media/news...then what's next?  Can you really trust that news source to have your best interest at heart with the TRUTH...or is there another agenda at play (even potentially at play)?!?!    **EDIT 2** Caldude...you are correct.  And I do not endorse Bush going on Fox News (exclusively) either.  However, an op-ed is different than an overtly pandering interview.  An op-ed implies that it has the full support of the publication of which it is printed in.  A verbal interview gives a better feel for whether the questions are truly hardball and how they are handled.  I would prefer a "forum" interview where the big news channels would have a panel interview asking various questions at the same time with each question/answer being given a time limit.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	That *** clown will stoop to any level to try and manipulate the american public to supporting his trillion dollar pork plan|`|CIqd0ykwaa	Yeah, republicans have done it, including former President Reagan.    On May 24, 1983, the Post published an oped from Ronald Reagan entitled "The MX: A Key to Arms Reduction."    But you probably think that was appropriate because he was "the great communicator."    Quite frankly, I wish all presidents published more op-eds other than being written words, they're no different than going on the radio or television. I hope President Obama writes one often. I'm fed up with 30-second sound bites pumped through the television giving us no real insight into deep thoughts from our leaders on the complex issues of our times.    So, if this is disturbing to you, and if you think this is "evidence of a fiat between the media and liberals," it looks like President Reagan may have disagreed.     Try if you can to get past those spooky liberal conspiracies and stop being a reactionary. Op-eds are simply another form of communication; only longer and more challenging because you have to read and think for yourself.    P.S. I don't think you can have a "fiat" between two parties.  A fiat is a command or order.|`|cY81Xqafaa	Yes. George W Bush (43) wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on January 3, 2007:    What the Congress Can Do for America    Let them say of these next two years: We used our time well.       http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/...|`|v0G9s9ktaa	Probably.    george w bush would have liked to, but no newspaper would take his submission because it was written in red crayon.
nrnVqh7iaa	He gets $400,000 a year, two private planes and a helicopter, limo service, private chef, vacation homes, free rent, armed guards, etc...    He gets more perks than those corporate executives he is complaining about using taxpayer money... Is Obama going to limit his OWN compensation plan paid for by us?    That is the problem with socialists, they want to limit everybody but themselves...    Obama can afford his own damn fiddle!|`|AA11388462	That would actually be a better use of taxpayer money|`|MDq1XVWRaa	You would be better off chipping in for a shovel to dig us out of the hole bush/cheney put us in.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	News flash...  Obama has been in office TWO WEEKS.  Jesus Christ himself couldn't come down from the clouds and fix the mess that your party has gotten us into in that short a time!  You're bitter and angry that your preferred candidate didn't get elected, you're apparently under the illusion that things were all peachy keen before Obama came into office, and are under the illusion that Obama should have been able to magically fix all of the problems in this country after only TWO WEEKS in office, which is like thinking you could clean up after Hurricaine Katrina with a broom and a can of Endust. You're determined to think that the fact that he hasn't magically solved all of our problems yet means that he's a "failure".  You've been scared by the republicans into thinking that not voting for them will be catastrophic for our country.  You've been brainwashed into being deathly afraid of anything that strays from the way that republicans have been doing things, and even when it can be clearly pointed out how bad a failure their policies have been, you don't see it, and instead try to blame the problems on a president who's been in office for TWO WEEKS!    The problems we're having are based on the policies your preferred candidates and their party have been keeping in force for years.  Anything goes regulation, politicized science research, corporate socialism/no bid contracts/RECORD outsourcing and deficit spending, the energy department being in bed with big oil (literally and figuratively--don't forget, meth and prostitutes!), giving tax break after tax break after tax break to the richest 1% of people in this country while taxing the middle class into the poorhouse--claiming that it's going to "create more jobs". (Apparently not noticing that, despite the fact that we've been doing that for YEARS, it's NOT creating more jobs!) Millions of people are getting LAID OFF while the corporate CEO's are getting billions of dollars in salaries, billions of dollars in bonuses, and absurdly extravagent golden parachutes when they bail out of the companies that they have driven into the ground. And the republican party wants to continue throwing money at them without any accountability whatsoever. You wanted to vote a candidate into office who still firmly insisted right up until we had to sign a $700 billion bail-out that there should be LESS regulation. (Then all of a sudden changed his tune.)  Exactly HOW bad do things need to get before you acknowledge that your preferred ideas are the ones that aren't working?  You've HAD your chance...you BLEW it.  Big time.  "Obama sucks! We need to impeach him! He's going to ruin this country!"  Lol.  WAKE UP.  You need to listen to yourself, blaming a president who's been in office two weeks on the problems our country is experiencing.  It's absurd.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I totally agree with what JJ said.|`|AA10586974	yes|`|m1T2fSnHaa	Yes, I will give you a buck three eighty!|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Great analogy!  How about 'let them eat cake'?|`|eceLQUj5aa	You don't remember who/want destroyed the economy do you?    Economic turnarounds take years to happen. Yes you have to spend money to get the economy turned around. Yes banks will need capital to loan with. Yes consumers need tax breaks and readjusted mortgages. Yes, Obama is working hard at it. No, it is not right to criticize him for not having fixed this yet; the depression we are in will not simply disappear.|`|yB0fWb1Uaa	Haaaaaaa OMG now this made me bust out laughing!!!|`|LCA7gdoiaa	I don't know about the fiddle - but he's done such great work in 2 weeks that an elementary school in Hempstead (NJ I believe) has been renamed for him.

In his first years of office FDR took the nation into a tailspin that it never recovered from completely.  It was the rise of two fellow fascist socialist tyrants in Europe -- Hitler and Stalin that provided a 50 year economic cure to us, that cure was effected when we went to war with their evil.      Yet FDR left us poisoned in our laws and with the cancer of socialism carried throughout our society.   Today we have four major forces working against us: (1) The deadly moral cancer of secularist fascist socialism all throughout our nation in every aspect of life (2) A morally feeble, yet smooth talking man who has gained the office of President, who is backed by the morally repugnant big money  men.  (3) The toxic legacy of FDR's version of national socialism in our laws and courts, it has near totally supplanted the highly limited charter of Liberty that the Founders laid out for us, and the grand freedoms and rights of men gained by the English in Common Law which we inherited at the Founding.  (4) A economic tailspin downwards.    So you think Obama will make the economy better.    History says "No way!", and says it clearly and stridently.    Please read up on what Amity Shlaes has had to say.|`|7fXuH1R3aa	No...    The people of this country will make things better-your government has little hand in the economy, contrary to popular rhetoric.|`|70ce28ddca2fb9f359700f7e854fcb03aa	He's already made things worse.

As I recall, the economy had to almost collapse for him to act.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Yes, and those people are Republicans that didn't agree with the first bill and didn't agree with Bush.    Ultimately the biggest fear mongers have been Pelosi and Frank. On the first bill Frank went straight to the cameras after it was shot down in the House and told America that Republicans were going to cost the American people millions because they were not going to pass the bill. God forbid we actually read the thing and make it a good bill! Pelosi came out yesterday and said, "every month that this stimulus bill is not passed 500 million Americans will lose their jobs." Get ready America! We are all going to get fired 3-4 times in the next month!|`|5wej1TKDaa	Good observation, I was thinking the same thing.  It looks like both sides use their scare tactics to pass what they want passed...THAT is the only thing that's scary!
43885d249f6e12d0c9543cbcbaffc9bbaa	The media coverage of Katrina was to embarrass Bush as much as possible and allow the Democrats a scapegoat for their failure to act.  The Mayor of New Orleans and the Governor of LA did not take decisive action,  yet, later, both blamed Bush.  The Mayor didn't use the buses to move people nor keep the police on the job,  the Governor failed to have the Guard respond and maintain control of the city and help people.  Yet, both blamed Bush for a failure to act.    Look at the same coverage for Mississippi,  Katrina hit it just as hard, but the media had little interest in the damage or the controlled response provided by the Governor.  Of course, he was not a Democrat.  So, its hard to argue with your perspective.|`|G6yyceAxaa	first.  it shouldn't matter what race they are, they are Americans.    my son lives in Kentucky, and basically it just takes time to repair the stuff, you have to remember that the US infrastructure was built in the 50's. so lots of replacements needed.    as usual, the squeaky wheel get greased, so the focus seems to be on "how terrible a job Obama is doing"  (never saw a president get boos after being in office for less than 3 weeks)|`|94hXoyWCaa	Don't you mean most who did not ''follow directions''|`|AA11993638	It does seem funny that the news reports have been very limited, aid never came on a federal level even though Bush opened the door after Katrina for the federal government to at least offer some assistance without being asked in a timely manner. There has been little to no comment from the white house on this disaster. It does seem odd. I guess the lack of coverage is to keep people in the dark about what has happened and the lack of attention from Obama. Sad how something like this can happen in this great country. The president too bust in Washington determining how to spend money he does not have to actually assist and show his consideration to people who have suffered from this storm.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	They are sending tainted peanut butter to the victims?

All I heard was bring the troops home and Obama saying he would just do that.  Now these same people seem to be just fine with sending thousands more to fight and die in another useless place.|`|si7X6hrUaa	I guess you missed a big chunk of the Iraq news while Bush was in office.    The SURGE worked - US troops led by Gen. David Petraeas saw peaceful streets in Iraq for at least 6 months before Obama took office.    Some Bush haters will try to credit Obama with the hard work done by the former administration. It might spin well - but we all know that Obama opposed the surge.
AA11206283	uh...if it's his kid, and if he can't walk into a courtroom with a bunch of receipts signed by her for "Child support payments" he's screwed.    Yes he will get tagged for support.

Child support lawyer.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	It does not make a difference in the eyes or the law who left whom.  That being said I'm glad he is owning up to his moral and legal obligation and paying for his child.  Again it has nothing to do with whom left whom on whether he will have to pay support.  And I'm not sure of the law in your state but where I live the person who pays child support has to prove he/she is providing over 50% in money to the childs care.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	If she does take him to court for  child support   .  He has no proof of giving anything to her   A paper trail checks it is called  .

And even if they do pose a payment for the child he has shown that he is has a desire to do so even with out a court order  .  One last thing are they still married if they got a divorce already then a payment amount should of been set one him then  .  If she packed up and just left with out filing any type of form with the local court house with the intention of dissolving the relation ship  .

I only hope he has proof that he has been giving her money otherwise if she does file for child support, and she can, she will also get arrears.   The best advice you can give him now is to keep receipts of any and all payments he sends her. ALL OF THEM. If he doesnt have receipts for past payments, maybe he can go back and get cancelled check copies from his bank.   And stop telling him he only has to pay child support if the child is with him. It doesnt matter who the child is living with, that child still has to eat.

It IS fear-mongering when Obama says "we should pass this or face dire consequences"    The trick is figuring out what you should actually be fearful of and what is hype.    In this instance, our economy is heading towards a very bad place and our government (on both sides of the aisle) feels something needs to be done.      Nobody is saying "do nothing" right now, they are saying "why this and why that"    that is why this is easily justifiable in my opinion.|`|fjT0GoSqaa	Barry is trying to practice Chicago style muscle tactics well it doesn't work at the national level.

But the thousands of jobs we lose every day certainly does.|`|AA11963685	Sorry, I just don't see it that way. He is giving the same warnings to us that top economists are. I just can't see reality as fear mongering. Maybe it is easier to believe it's fear tactics than it is to believe we are in that much trouble. When I look around at what independent sources say about the enormous economic collapse we may be facing I can't then turn around and blame the President for telling us the truth about it - whether it's scary or not. I do believe it's the truth and not just because Obama is telling me so. There is way too much evidence that we are in exactly that much trouble.     This is nothing like what Bush did.  I do detest fear tactics and was extremely unhappy about the use of it under Bush's Administration. Fear tactics is how Bush ran his entire two terms. Every time he and his cronies wanted something the American people might have objected to they scared the crap out of us to obtain free reign. When I see evidence of the same from Obama I won't hesitate to say so either. So far, I don't believe that is what is happening here, but I'll keep an open mind about it.    And just a suggestion.  Using FOX news as a source is akin to using Wiki or CNN.  All biased, all suspect as far as correct information goes.|`|AA11540917	like how dick cheney is fear mongering right now ?

Even Bush is on board, as he is the one who passed the bailout bill for the banks, right at the time of the historic plunge of stocks last September 2008 and the demise of Lehman Brothers.

As another soldier, whom I may add will be spending his next year beginning in May in lovely Afghanistan, am delighted to read these DISRESPECTFULL MF'ing SOB LIBERALS as if they have any CLUE as to what has taken place in the Middle East.  Fear Mongering from Bush about "pretend terrorists"?  Are you F'ing kidding me?  I would literally CHOKE a MF'r out if they ever muttered such as a hint of conspiracy theory over 9/11 in the proximity of me.  They wouldn't know a terrorist threat if it hung a 10ft phalace and F'd them in the face with it.    Now that i have gotten that out from reading the ignorant liberal verbal vomit that you have received in previous answers, I would say that fear democrat/liberal fear mongering is an understatement.  They like to disguise and create the fear through fabricated crisis's such as what Obama spit out today with the whole "America will not survive if we dont act quickly on this stimulus".  Nancy Pelosi saying 500 million Americans lose jobs every month we dont act.  HORSECRAP she slipped up, your number 3 in line from the President, you get your words together before opening your mouth when all of America is hanging hopes on every word you say.

Without a bailout the US recession would hit epic proportion.  He's trying to find a medium to satisfy republicans and democrats on the hill in order to pass a stimulus package.  Both sides would agree 100% it's just a matter of where to put the money and how much.  Bush, the world's biggest dumbass used 9/11 to institute wholesale changes to how we do business in war.  I'm referring to interrogation, prisoners and the patriot act.  All of which would be fine and dandy on the down low, but when you use those things to instill fear even in your own country toward you countrymen you've crossed the line to ego-maniac.  The people of US whole-heartedly support our troops however, they don't support the mission and neither does the rest of the world.  We've overstepped our boundaries and we let Bush push us there.   I for one and sorry for and pissed about 9/11 but we really didn't do anything about.  Should have went after BinLaden full force and captured him Dead or alive and shown the world pictures and facts about that.  However, since we bombed the **** out Afghanistan where we think and probably was we'll never now if he's dead.  Case in point, now all hear from him are tapes. Who's to now if we ever got him....And that sucks to hear, but that's Bush(s) fault for not having a rock solid plan and letting HIS emotions get the best of him.

Anyone who thinks that Isalm is a peaceful religion does not know what they are talking about.    the Warlord Muhammad who founded Islam tried and failed to xonquer the Jewish People of Medina and convert them to Islam approximately 1,500 years ago.    Muhammad was so upset by his failure to conquer the Jewish People of Median that he issued a degree that all faithful Muslims must kill all Jewish People whereever they may find them.    That is the reason that Muslim Terrorists are so determined to kill all of the Jewish People.    Modern Musliim Terrorists revere a man named Haj Amin al Husseini, who managed to get himself appointed as The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem back in the 1920's even though he was not qualified to hold the position and came in fourth out of four candidates running for the position of Grand Mufti.    Haj Amin al Husseini made an alliance with Adolf Hitler and the NAZIS to kill all of the Jewish People in The Middle East.    During World War II Haj Amin al Husseini was a guest of Adolf Hitler and the NAZIS in Germany.    Adolf Hitler and the NAZIS were so impressed with Haj Amin al Husseini that they put all of the radio stations in Germany at the disposal of Haj Amin al Husseini.    Haj Amin al Husseini made hate filled broadcasts into The Middle East.    As a result of those broadcasts the Muslim Terrorists in The Middle East murdered thousands of Jewish People.    Adolf Hitler was so impressed with the results of those broadcasts that Adolf Hitler put Haj Amin al Husseini an charge of a Waffen SS Unit.    Under the leadership of Haj Amin al Husseini that Waffen SS Unit murdered all of the Jewish People in Bosnia.    Haj Amin al Husseini was also  one of the founders of a Muslim Terrorist group known as The Muslim Brotherhood.    The goal of the Muslim Brotherhood is to kill all of the Jewish People in The World.    Disciple of Haj Amin al Husseini went on to found a number of Muslim Terrorist Organizations including Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Al Qaida.    All of these Muslim Terrorist Organizations have as their goal to kill all of the Jewish People in the world.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	The Bible says I should kill you if you work on Sunday.

It seems like most of the people tried to defeat your point by saying that the Judeo-Christian religion was just as bad. I also suspect that most of the people here quoting the Bible have not open one in a very long time if at all.    We are taught in the Bible that we are to love God and love one another. On these two laws hang all the other Scriptures. The first question that man asked of God in the Bible is, "Am I my brother's keeper?" God spent the rest of the Bible answering that one question. I do not understand how anyone can equate the Judeo-Christian religions to a religion that flys planes full of innocent people into skyscrapers killing hundreds on the planes and thousands on the ground. Were the Muslim extremists a perfect example of all Muslims? Probably not but where was the condemnation? Where is the condemnation when they send suicide bombers into schools and cafes? Perhaps Islam is peaceful but Islamofascism is not. All we seem to see is the Islamofascists. It would be like saying Jim Jones or David Koresh represent all Christians.    God does not tell us to love one another and then tell us to stone an adulterer. I don't recall Jesus stoning her just as you said. Rather, He showed us a better way, to love one another. He did not condone the adultery as He told the woman to repent, to go and sin no more. He calls us all to the same thing. The people here who are taking Scripture out of context are just twisting it to meet their agenda.     It's not very easy trying to love one another.    There is much about the Bible that I do not understand yet but I'm working on it. One thing I feel strongly about is that if my actions toward another person do not show God's love, then my actions are unscriptural. Burning a Cross on a black person's lawn is not Christian. Flying planes into buildings is not peaceful and I hope it is not Islam. I think GWB said that on that fateful day to stop a modern-day crusade.     The Crusades are a historical example of just how wrong the Bible can be misunderstood. The people that quoted the Bible in trying to answer your question are another good example however, they can always claim ignorance as their excuse.|`|OQdPzl15aa	because people only believe what they want to hear.  People don't care about facts anymore, only what sounds good and doesn't disrupt their lifestyle.    It's funny how nobody answered your question, but instead decided to ramble on about how "bad" Christianity is, because like many people, they take bit's and pieces out of context to prove a point.    The Quaran tells it's followers to kill the enemy vs. the Bible that tells it's followers to pray for the enemy.    There is nothing peaceful about it; it comes down to how it's readers interpret it...much like the Bible.  Many people interpret the Bible wrong, and that leads to people bombing abortion clinics....but again, the Bible doesn't condone killing the enemy.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	YOU MADE ME LAUGH HARD WHEN I READ THIS, NOTHING IN THE QURAN SAYS SO, YOU'VE BEEN MISLEAD BY SOME STUPIDS:  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|l9dRHwMaaa	there's plenty of violence in the bible too|`|JpvXhgmraa	Islam isn't necessary a "peaceful" religion,................but the bible says disobedient children should be stoned to death................I'm just saying|`|1VeqStpmaa	Do you think Christianity is a peaceful religion?

The Bible condones killing for the following: working on the sabbath, homosexuality, adultery, and wearing clothes of two different threads.|`|Ksht6EM5aa	Take a look at the history of any religion, and you'll see the same thing applies.|`|XWQoVCXLaa	Have you ever read the Quaran?|`|axHyoVqGaa	Islam is not a peaceful religion despite the claims of the politically correct and practitioners of Islam, who would deny the truth.  Anyone who has ever opened and read through the Quran can tell you that it is filled with verse after verse which inspires hate or prompts people to commit violent acts.  For example:    Fight in the way of Allah. 2:190, 2:244     Believers must retaliate. Those who transgress will have a painful doom. 2:178    Kill disbelievers wherever you find them. If they attack you, then kill them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 2:191-2    War is ordained by Allah, and all Muslims must be willing to fight, whether they like it or not. 2:216    If you die fighting for Allah, you'll be rewarded in heaven. 3:157    Believers fight for Allah; disbelievers fight for the devil. So fight the minions of the devil. 4:76     Have no unbelieving friends. Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them. 4:89     If the unbelievers do not offer you peace, kill them wherever you find them. Against such you are given clear warrant. 4:91     I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  Keep in mind, that I understand perfectly that their are Muslim who disregard the violent teachings of the Quran, just as their are Christians who disregard the violent teachings of the Bible, however that doesn't change the fact that Islam as a religion is violent.  Hell, even the word Islam means "to submit."  How much more of a clue to you need as to the nature of a religion!    EDIT    Don't you hate people who point out the violence in the Bible as a way to avoid addressing the issue of violence in the Quran.

c9efb9774c2c4a0a3e5040b9d214c4d7aa	Organized labor vs. illegal immigration     While there are certainly many unions that do not discriminate when it comes to who they try to organize, this is not true of all unions.    One of the arguments sometimes used by organized labor is that the hiring of illegal immigrants drives down everyones wages.  Because the immigrants are afraid of getting caught and have nowhere else to go, they are willing to accept much lower pay than those living here without fear.  Its hard to enforce minimum wage or work safety standards when the employees are too afraid to come forward  so the employers that hire these immigrants have an unfair advantage in the market.    My brother says, "It's not about giving a man a fish, and certainly not about teaching a man to fish... it's about letting a man fish!"    I certainly agree with this. Instead of fighting illegal immigration, organized labor should encourage the immigrants (and themselves) to simply take democratic control over their places of work, because even if they managed to send all the immigrants back to their countries of origin, their jobs will be shipped overseas anyway, in search of people willing to accept lower pay and with less rights to organize.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Why would Pres Obama be involved in a strike in the UK?

b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	The most common myth about Hanson was that he was the first President of the United States.    The origin of the claim that Hanson is the "forgotten" first President stems from a 1932 book by Seymour Wemyss Smith titled John Hanson  Our First President. Officially Hanson was the third President of the Continental Congress, successor to the first two men to hold the office, Samuel Huntington and Thomas McKean. He was the first to serve a full one-year term, and the first to formally use the title President of the United States in Congress Assembled.    The office of the President of the United States in Congress Assembled was, despite the name, not an executive post. It bears a closer resemblance to the modern Speaker of the United States House of Representatives or Vice President of the United States. The office was in existence from 1781 to 1788, under the Articles of Confederation. It was replaced by the modern office of President of the United States when the Constitution took effect in 1789. The modern office is significantly more powerful as an executive position.|`|AA10465540	John Hanson was not an African- American, nor was he the President of the United States.

In one of his columns he repeated most of the myths and added a new one, that John Hanson was the descendant of an African American slave.    There are two possible origins for this belief. The first is that Hanson's grandfather, another John Hanson, was an early English immigrant to Maryland. As was common at the time, he worked as an indentured servant on his arrival in the New World to pay off the cost of his passage. In 1661, his first master, William Plumley, sold his contract to Edward Keene and recorded the contract with the court of Calvert County, Maryland; similar court records were also used to transfer title to land and slaves. But, in six years, the immigrant John Hanson had worked his way out of debt. A few years later, he purchased his own small farm. There is no record that the grandfather was black, but the record of sale of the indenture contract may have been confused by researchers with that of chattel slavery.    Another alternative may be a simple case of confusion with Senator John Hanson, a politician from Liberia, who was involved with the resettlement of freed slaves in that country. Whilst this Hanson was indeed black, he lived a hundred years too late to be an ancestor of Hanson of the Continental Congress.    >>    Barack Obama|`|juG7X5gyaa	Never heard of John Hanson..I'll have to google him.

Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid do not represent me (Thank God) but I still feel that they should hear what I and those like me think.

There is no stimulus in this Porkulus Maximus bill; it is just a wish list of spending projects that the far left wants. If governemtn spending was the way to fix the economy, we'd never have economic downturns! We could just fire up the printing press and print up more dollars, like Obama is pushing!    Of course, this leads to hyper-inflation and a further devaluation of our currency on the world market. It's obvious that the dems have never passed a college-level economic class. They depend on pseudo-economists like Paul Krugman, who places political bias in the place of economic fundamentals, to guide them down this road to financial ruin.    Worthless war?

They need to work with the democrats and get the bill passed so we can get on with the business of trying to get out of this mess that THEY created.  They weren't worried about spending money for the last 8 years that got us into this mess.  Why all of a sudden are they so concerned?      It just slays me that republicans are not interested in investing in this country's infracstructure but they have no qualms spending a boat load of money on a useless war.|`|JA2CazSSaa	No, since Bush was the king of pork rolling for almost eight years because of him, public schools in northern Virginia have rock climbing walls & forensic labs while many of the schools in the rest of America cannot afford new school books.

Who wants it to be legal? Prostitues? There money will be taxed. Johns? Since many are married, don't think that will happen. Pimps? Then it will be legal and there will be no need for them.

Prositution, drugs and other issues of no real consequence  are what keep Republicans alive, those blood sucking  idiot Americans|`|2mlHf7Opaa	Prostitution is a very complex issue.  I believe in decriminalization, but not necessarily legalization.  In general, I believe that prostitution and rape are linked: prostitution comes about from society trying to repress women, and rape comes about from society punishing women.    Of course, there are always exceptions.  Some prostitutes are in it for the quick money, and some rapists are just sick psychos.  Not everything can be reduced to such a neat sociological theory.    As far why prostitution is illegal, I believe that most people would cite the moral issue.  Myself, I believe that the men are living out domination fantasies on these women, and the men should possibly be subject to a fine.  Certainly, they should not face any criminal penalties.  The women, on the other hand, need help finding a better life.  For them, I would suggest counseling, detox, and educational opportunities.  You can't make someone better their life, but you can give them opportunities.    At the very least, we can attempt to keep the prostitutes healthy and safe.  Decriminalization is the best way to do this.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Usually when it is victimless* crime it is illegal to stop competition with the state.

Yup, Nevada has rampant plagues.:)    Who is the competition for prostitutes?  Lobbyist wives?    * Yes, victimless.

And it is not taxable.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	No one seems to be answering the question; the question isn't "Why should/shouldn't prostitution be illegal?", the question is "Why is prostitution illegal?" Prostitution is illegal because at some point in the past pressure groups have lobbied for it to be made illegal. Most of these groups were made up of the same well-intentioned dictators who lobbied for prohibition, smoking bans, and book burning. Whatever the (genuine) good reasons for outlawing prostitution, the real reason it is illegal NOW is because some people think they know what is good for us better than we do.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	I believe, one reason is tax "evasion" and the other is to reduce the spread of STDs.|`|LKlPlwdKaa	wanker|`|IczYnBelaa	It's like why Marijana is illegal... Uncle sam can't make any money off it. NOt to mention, the USA was founded on Christian principals and prostitution is a form of fornication. God didn't like that too much in the bible.|`|AA11206283	Puritanism    Plain and simple|`|ez5BjZdRaa	Nope, to control crime, and a big issue with prostitution is the spreading of diseases. the biggest reasons for it being illegal is crime, and controlling diseases|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Prostitution is legal if you do it at the Bunny Ranch or a brothel or something|`|fe8RxYsfaa	Yes, because of moral standards, and it spreads disease.  Mostly morals.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i would say STD's. cuz i feel if they wanna have sex for money go for it. but make it legal n if a guy whats sex he has to have a paper saying he doesn't have ne std or something, n the prostitutes should have regular check ups 2 make sure they arent passing nething as well  \  im pro prostitutes lol

BUT, something always comes up in the hearings, they dig deep, they got people who dig deep.   Every president has this happen, you deal with and move on...Just because your Republican and love what Bush has done with the country (pushed it to the brink of financial collapse, the world hates us, we can't win in Iraq/Afghan. Daddy issues, just plain dumb) don't be pissed.  It is was it is, it's not Chicago politics, it's not criminal it's the process.

R7Hexutqaa	About the same number of successes in the world as a result of it.  It's a moot point to blame or praise the unfolding of history for our present state of affairs.  It's only important to understand history and the results of those events to guide our decisions today for the future.    What problems in the world today can be directly traced to the discovery of fire?|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Blame whitey for everything.  You will get an "A".|`|6B1sxgtOaa	You are right but this was how many years ago.  It was a different time and we all should just get over it.

I'd bet that guy taught that the Crusades were an initiated action by Anglophiles, rather than a reaction to the Muslim Crusades that immediately preceded them!|`|T2zD3FS6aa	A better question would be how many problems were concealed by colonialism that resurfaced with it's demise.
zrR7KXCnaa	EU off course :D  But seriously I don't think it's possible and I guess the one who said no one was correct. And more so EU still hasn't got unified army even though this was one of the first things that the first member states tried to do. The WEU (western EU) which is a defence organisation just like NATO is more or less idle since the NATO became the major player.  And members of WEU started to give more attention to NATO than to WEU. Now it's talk of joint taskforces for quick deployment and it's well under way...  But I don't think that it would ever come to this, maybe to cold war but never "hot".|`|rWqrN7Apaa	No one would win a major war.|`|zvq3uiB6aa	eu|`|ewx1qj7Gaa	wait until america canada and mexico are merged into the North American Union in a couple of years,  and then ask your question.

It leads children to die before their parents|`|pkTE0YwOaa	The Usa would win.    The reson being is that the Eu does not have one single military.    Each nation controls its armed forces.    The Usa would be under the command of one general.    The eu would be under the command of all the generals of the warring countries.    Plus the soldiers in the eu armies would be using it as an excuse to kill eachother.    The Usa is responsible for more friendly fire than most nations.    But can you imagine Austrian and Italians or Brits and Germans fighting side by side without a few murders??    If you think im mad.....    Germans and Brits have allied before and both sided had to put armed sentries outside their tents to kill the constant stream of their foreign friends slipping in and murdering them while they slept.|`|VWwepyibaa	The USA, the Eu would not even exist if it wasnt for the power of the US of A|`|1mZTOQHEaa	The USA, if they could get their troops home from Iraq...|`|BKfGQDEHaa	USA|`|s3E3KfBsaa	USA!

Among other reasons because it's got so much practice as far as wars are concerned.''  The USA don't have much practice with full out wars where every man over 16 or 18 have to fight and die for their country. But rather small conflicts with minor skirmishes, and an army built up by volunteers. Like World War 2 the USA is dependent on other nations wearing their enemy out before they enter themselves.    Anyway that's an unlikely scenario.|`|AA11847612	The depends. Are the cheese-eating surrender monkeys in charge of the EU forces?|`|a66nvk0taa	Stupid question for a start the EU doesn't have a so called EU army. Give example out of the 27 countries in the EU Ireland is a neutral country. Each government with in the EU are in charge of their own army. You American are pure warmonger|`|XwtmNIMOaa	No one. Our combined arsenals would destroy the world a million times over.
z42u6Tbkaa	The odds of deployment over the next 6 years of your contract are pretty good. Thats to say probably once, depends. If you want to see when the unit you'll be joining might leave, just look at when they last left. Usually, theres 2-3 years give or take between deployments. Deployments are what you make of it, they suck at times, but at times they are fun. Some guys love doing it, some don't, depends on who you talk to.|`|Xa11cmVNaa	My unit didn't deploy until I was out... 4 years and no action, It really depends on your unit's mission and when they deployed last. I liked it (right up until the very end, it did get a bit old), but I do wish that I would stayed in|`|C79bJLAzaa	Your chances of getting deployed are almost definite it all depends on your unit and whether or not they have been deployed recently. You may also be involuntarily attached to another deploying unit based on needs. The Marine Corps is a great experience as long as you keep out of trouble. You may want to check out the national guard in your state.
bnA0wUPRaa	Depends on his rank and how long he will be there for.|`|m5J36D28aa	Probably not, you couldn't when I was there and I keep hearing dependents are still not allowed there.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	It will depend on what base he is assigned to in Korea, some are allowing dependents to come but that means the orders go from 1 year unaccompanied to 3 years accompanied.   he needs to go, report in and put in the request to have the orders amended to accompanied if it is allowed.  You will then have to do a EFMP screening (medical/dental) to make sure you have do not have conditions that cannot be handled there on base clinics.  If approved then you will be allowed to go, you will be limited to what you can bring with you and all the remainder of HHG will go into storage along with your vehicle.|`|N7xKowJYaa	i don't know why unless things have changed.  my mom and i went with my dad and my brother was born there!|`|x2THxqDKaa	my husband was stationed at Kunsan afb and I went over there to visit him and I toured parts of seoul in which I know there is an army base there (youngson garrison) and that base had families there. Army is different than air force so I don't know if you could or not. I know in the air force if the tour is unaccompanied, then you cant be with them. Also if you are able to its very hard to do an A LOT of paperwork and you have to be married in order for that to ever happen.|`|AA10709853	if he gets accompanied orders you can.   Korea is granting more accompanied orders overall, but by no means is it guaranteed that he will A even GO and B that he can bring you.|`|749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	You should be able to. I've heard of entire families following the head-of-household, and my mom's first husband was low-rank, sent to Germany, where she could've gone.|`|AA12157171	NWIP is correct.    Most tours to South Korea are unaccompanied one year tours. But there is a 2-3 year incentive that will allow any rank to go with dependents. You will get payed (I believe and extra $300 a month) to do this and there are DOD schools for children to attend. Talk to you Military Personell flight and they can point you in the correct direction. This is a new program and some do not know about it. But it is possible.

As for an increase in military enlistments...give it time, it will happen just as it always does when the economy falters.|`|m5J36D28aa	There is no huge influx into the military because most people don't believe we should be in Iraq.
bnA0wUPRaa	Go to college DO NOT Enlist in the Marines regardless of what the recruiters tell you. After college join the Marines as a officer and go to OCS. Officer Candidate school.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I believe the Marines are part of the Navy, and the Navy definitely has an ROTC program at many universities.|`|AA10538330	To answer your question more directly, yes there are ROTC programs for future marines.  The US Marine Corps falls under the Department of the Navy.  Most of the programs geared towards college students coming into the Marines as an officer will come under Navy ROTC, you have to select the Marine Option.  What you need to do is look at the schools that you are interested in and see if they have an ROTC program.  You also have the option of applying to Naval Academy (it is too late for this year as applications had to be in by Jan 31st.) The recruiter is trying to get you to join the Marines to get to his quota.  If you are not ready to join up and want to pursue your education first forget this option.  You will gain nothing by being an enlisted at this point and it will actually complicate things for officer selection.  Trust me, I have been there and done that. Look for ROTC at a local university or college as your first option.
RjUhISEIaa	what is described is not "imminent danger" and therefore to break the order of the court could backfire badly against you.    You need to discuss this with the attorney. If it doesn't happen until after the next visitation then you have to let your husband take his daughter.     Save yourself the grief and let her go if you don't talk with the attorney.|`|AA10295984	No, you cannot break the court order without judicial intervention first. You need to contact an attorney immediately. When you see the attorney, give the attorney copies of the child's medical records.|`|R5RHMIYQaa	If you feel your child is imminent danger, the existing order does not apply.  The question then becomes, is she in imminent danger by visiting him.  That is a judgement call you as a parent need to make.  If I felt my child were in imminent danger, I would not send her to her father, how old is the child?  Is she an infant?  Does she still wear diapers?  Was the rash caused by him not changing her regularly?  Did you take pictures?  Pink eye happens, you cannot blame him for that.  There is no way to prove that he knew she had pink eye.  Why were her toes infected?  Pink eye is always severe, from onset.  Do you have a doctors statement stating that he neglected her conjunctivitis and did not seek medical attention for her, or a written opinion from a physician that the severity of it was caused from neglect?  How about for the rash?  Yes, you can deny visitation, if you have can prove by preponderance of evidence that your daughter was in fact neglected or abused at her fathers.  Have you received any written proof substantiating the claim that your daughter was abused by the agency of whom you made the report?  Have they even examined your daughter?  Next time, if I were you, I would, receive medical treatment and ask the doctor to write a statement, then, I would take your daughter in to the abuse agency and ask them to examine her on the spot and show them the written doctors report and ask them to deny or supervise visitation.  If you deny him visitation without probable cause, then you could be charged with violation of a court order.  Get probable cause first, always.  You need to make certain that your childs pediatrician is aware of what occured that if it occurs again, they need to know again and again, until they write you a statement.

So now we need to have our country turned around again from the recession/depression we are in.|`|67d9963e687ff64ac5d02a2e50fa2b47aa	George Washington comes to my mind. He may have owned slaves which I don't admire at all but he did believe in isolationism. He believed a country is raised strong when it concerns itself with its own people and problems. He didn't go about and try to occupy other countries and get involved with other people problems. If problems came directly to the country from the outside then we make a defense (inside the country) in case the danger came here. No money problems because a lot of focus would be here and no where else.

He took a nation in abject depression and restored hope, saying "the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself."      FDR's WPA put millions to work, building roads, dams, schools, parks, and sewage systems as well as rural electrification which is still in use today.  He invested in the arts, and in the history of the USA.  If it wasn't for FDR's policies and projects, which put infrastructure and work teams in place, the USA would not have been strong enough to respond to the Japanese attack and the German declaration of war.  FDR appointed Truman to oversee the war contracts to prevent corruption so that no one profited from the war.    Reagan was a criminal who should have been impeached for Iran-Contra and Lincoln embroiled the country in a civil war which killed off more than half of all able bodied American men, left the South in ruins, and mired the country in debt putting the country back 100 years.  Alexander Hamilton was not a president.|`|etcMARCAaa	I am not sure if I could pick one since the challenges that presidents have faced are what defined them. Lincoln is mentioned and he did save the union as well as lay the foundation that made us a stronger nation by centralizing the government.  But he also led the administration that was responsible for the deaths of over half a million American's so it's hard to call his Presidency an unqualified success.   Similar could be said of Franklin D. Roosevelt. It's is debatable as to whether his policies ended our great depression or whether World War 2 was responsible for making us economically powerful.  Debatable but most historians will say we can thank WW2 for that and his many programs were not really much more than a moral boost.   I have nothing bad to say about Washington.  Maybe he was our best.  I also think highly of Teddy Roosevelt.  He did allot of good with the short time he held his office that most of us barely acknowledge even if we still benefit today from his leadership.   I can't say who was greatest because what made some of them great, how much they influenced history, also made them controversial.  Hopefully one day we will say Obama was a great one but only time will tell.  I hope that not because I supported him but because right now we need a great president as much as we ever have.  Whether we like him or not lets all hope he is great for all our sakes.
orn3Z7loaa	World War 1 would of been won without America, Yes, World War 2 i don't know, You see Britain relied upon the Convoy System, without American aide the convoy would of been destroyed due to the wolf packs. No convoy no munitions, food, or oil. without these resources Britain collapses. No Britain, no need for a large army on the Western Front. The entire might of the third Reich is brought to bear on the Soviet Union. The entire Luftwaffe is brought to bear taking control of the skies. The Me-262 would own any Soviet fighter. The bombers would obliterate every Soviet City, With no United States to fight, Japan attacks the Soviet Union from the East. Russia is now fighting on two fronts. The Soviet Union signs a cease fire.

Hitler was in both them wars, he more or less began the 2 one just because of his beliefs and he had many followers. Many of the people were just not into it at all they keep their nose out of the mess, and those that made much of a fuss were shot any way so that kept even more eyes turned away from it. Now had the US not got into how much longer could this war kept on going? look at the current on, they have been fight with one another since time began and they still are. Maybe soon with all or interventions could settle this mess for a time. But it will raise its ugly head once again someplace else.Another bully will think they can rule the world thus start killing and again the US will step in to stop them.|`|AA10465540	Actually, it would have been possible for the European Allies to beat Germany during both wars without U.S. involvement.|`|au0ssSnvaa	Maybe,      But at a much higher cost than was paid. I think Germany would have eventually had a coup in WWII.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	Yes, it would have been possible, but with many more lives lost and an extension of both wars by 2 or 3 years.|`|B3uch2eNaa	At the time that the US got into the war Germany already had most of Europe and was bombing England relentlessly. That means that the only opposition to Germany was Russia and i dont think that Russia was strong enough or even prepared to fight Germany because they believed the pact that was made with Hitler. So my answer is maybe but most likely not
1ymL5LKlaa	With over 60% of Americans owning their own home, the renter is not an average American.  Those in the low income levels are not paying any federal income taxes, as long as they file a return, they get more back than they pay in.  There are many programs available to low income citizens that the middle class do not qualify for that are funded by both the state and federal government, such as food stamps and MediCaid.

So?|`|y40At0Fpaa	Obama should refuse to get a dog because dog's and other pets cause global warming and deplete the world's resources that are used to grow food.

They wanted to get a shelter dog but because of Malia's allergies, it may not be so easy.    But I hope that something will come through.|`|fh12fkNWaa	They DO have their names on waiting lists in animal shelters, waiting for one of two breeds to show up. The breed matters because one of the daughters is allergic and they need a specific type of dog that produces less dander. Presidential dogs have always set trends which is why they ARE going through a shelter. Pure breeds show up in shelters all the time, for those who can wait.
RkfIPD7Iaa	It's an obvious impossibility.  Besides, even if it was, half the clowns out there would allow it to happen just to 'punish' the other spouse.    The best thing for the child, in almost ALL cases, is shared custody and mental counseling for the idiots who bore the child.  Any parent who violates a shared custody agreement is fined two month's salary.    If they can't play like adults, they deserve to be treated like children.

The USDA web site has a pre-screening took that can help you determine if you are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps). Basic information and a link to the tool are at http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsp/applicant_re... welfare eligibility requirements vary by state, and you may wish to contact the local office by looking in the blue pages of your phone book for the number.    For utility assistance, your utility companies can help you determine your eligibility. Call your utility (electric and gas) companies' customer service numbers and they will help you determine if you are eligible, and if so, get you set up.    You may also wish to contact the local food bank or churches in your area. They may be able to get you linked up with organizations that can provide you with assistance and help you through the application process.    Good luck to you, and here's hoping this situation is very temporary and you're back on your feet soon.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	If you paid unemployment insurance as part of your business then you may qualify for unemployment.  If not, I would talk to the local agency and see if you qualify for welfare.

Irjopfpvaa	Passports are for American citizen only. In order to get one, you have to apply for citizenship first...Which will mean you have to wait for 5 years and continue active residence in USA for same duration.    You dont agree? Ask any NCSIS personnel then.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	You need to be a US national to get a passport. You do not qualify if you have a green card.    NOTE: A US passport states:The Secretary of State of the United States... the citizen/national of the United States...    Why? because nationals of the US can get passports!|`|Maw2rtKZaa	Passports are only for US citizens.  You can apply to USCIS for a reentry permit which will allow you to leave and reenter the country for a period of 2 years.       As for requirements, typically you have to wait for five years and establish good moral character.|`|VVMlAxQtaa	If you have an actual "green card", then you've been a naturalized US citizen for some time I assume?  "Green Cards" are not issued out anymore, now you become a Natz US citizen, and you receive a certificate.  With that being said, if you are a US citizen either born or natz, then you will be required to get a US Passport.  Currently, a US passport is required if you plan to travel by air or ship outside the US, except for Puerto Rico.  You can use a US Passport for any land border crossing (Mexico or Canada), but if you ONLY plan on crossing at land borders, you may be eligible to apply for an enhanced driver's license or a US Passport Card.  These are only good for land border crossings, and are cheaper than a full US Passport.   All other question for requirments will be answered in your application. There in you will find the needed info for your passport.  If you're a US citizen, you've met a requirement already.    Good Luck|`|HvI2WhDraa	Hi,  you can get a US passport only if you are a US citizen.  To become a US citizen you have to go through NATURALIZATION:    Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is conferred upon a foreign citizen or national after he or she fulfills the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The general requirements for administrative naturalization include:    a period of continuous residence and physical presence in the United States;  residence in a particular USCIS District prior to filing;  an ability to read, write, and speak English;  a knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government;  good moral character;  attachment to the principles of the U.S. Constitution; and,  favorable disposition toward the United States.    depending on where you are from originally you will need or don't need to give up your other citizenship. For example: i'm originally from Italy and because US and Italy have an agreement, i will be able to keep both citizenships, but not every country has the same agreement.    After you do the interview and they approve you as a citizen, you can easly ask for a passport at most post offices.    Good luck!

UvzKiis0aa	Oh, BS!  CEOs in Europe and Japan don't get paid these crazy salaries and they often eat these guys' lunches as far as being competitive. These guys don't get fired when they don't produce, many times they get bonuses, because they have the board in their pockets.  It's a closed society without any accountability.    If executive salaries are capped to 50 times the lowest salary in the company, we might see some movement in fairness and competitiveness in the business world.    The POTUS makes less than $500K and he is the leader of the free world.  Why do these guys think they deserve more?|`|1amF7oNwaa	The salary cap only applies to companies that take government money starting yesterday.

Yes, rich do pay a lot of tax but when someone can explain to me how this guy, along with the CEO's of all the oil companies, making 50 million benefits us I will change my mind. They raped us and have been doing it for decades.     He made that $$$ at your expense and mine. Take some of this money in salaries and flood the market with it, that drives competition, destroys monopolies and gives us more buying power.     The way I see it, if you want a bail out, fine, you play by the new rules.

Ordered a review of auto emissions standards.   ? Met with GOP leaders of both Houses of Congress to improve the stimulus package.  ? Did an interview with Al Arabiya TV, improving our reputation in the Arab/Muslim world.  ? Talked to every leader in the Middle East.   ? Named George Mitchell special envoy to the Middle East. Mitchell is already on the scene.  ? Got most of his cabinet confirmed.   ? Made family planning advice more available to women in Africa.  ? Met with top business leaders, who endorsed his stimulus plan.  ? Geithner put limits on lobbying from bank who receive TARP money (something Paulson could have easily done.)  ? Signed equal pay legislation  ? Condemned Wall Street bonuses  ? Ordered federal contractors to offer jobs to current workers when contracts change, and made it more difficult for federal contractors to discourage union activities.  ? Quickly released federal aid to fix power outages in Kentucky.  ? Provided healthcare to 4 million poor children.  ?

Russia's economy is still trying to recover when the USSR collapsed, and arms is one of its biggest industries. Russian tech is durable and fairly cheap, that's why its preferred among the poorer nations.    No, Russia isn't as big of a threat as Al-Qaeda. Russia is as big of a threat to the US as Brazil is.    Testing airspace in Alaska? The US goes through everyones airspace. What's your point?

So it wasn't as it if was a war  and the pirates will continue to take hostages  and demand a few million.  and they will continue to get it.  Look at it this way.

You will be asked to sign this letter, indicating which one of the offer choices you want to accept and showing that you understand the repayment terms and that you have to repay the loan.

Yes, they can express free thought.  What they are not allowed to do is stand on a soap box doing that.  In private they are allowed to say what they want.    I have talked to government officials about the pit falls of capitalism, communism, socialism, etc with no fear whatsoever.  On the other hand I am not allowed to teach such subjects in my college classes.  Politics and religion are taboo.  Religion like it is in the USA and since I teach English as a second language, I would think teaching partisan politics in the USA would be frowned upon in an English class.    I have said this a thousand times, what most people in the west know of China would fit in a thimble, what most people think they know would fit in a barrel.    Not to put you down, there is a lot of disinformation about China in the west, but I would open up your eyes and realize that in many cases you are getting only one side of the story.  That is one of the reasons I no longer believe our government when it comes to our enemies.    The best indicator of a countries health, both social and government is the amount of foreign investment, not what partisans and governments say.  China today is vastly different then the China when Mao died because the amount of investment flowing into that country is testament to that.    EDIT  What many people in the west do not seem to understand, is politics, for the most part, is not part of daily life in China.  These people are amazingly apathetic and are more concerned with getting ahead and living that middle class dream, then changing a government that for the most part leaves them alone.  That government has given them more freedom in the last few decades then at anytime in their history.  Yet we bash China without giving them any credit whatsoever.  The Idiots Guide to Starting a Business in China points that out several times.    Peace  Jim    .
CJRon7Fcaa	When you go by Bahrain Air, your luggage will come out after immigration unless the airline transfers it to Emirates.

The only way to escape this is to carry all your luggage as a hand bag and then check in with Emirates before the immigration as they have counters there.

cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	This is really a question you should call your housing office with.  Generally, however, if you are preparing to PCS, your family doesn't have to vacate housing unless/until your orders take you away from your current location.  It might matter how your orders are worded (be sure that whomever writes them puts in something about your family being authorized housing) but since they're already living there and you're not leaving yet, they should be fine until you complete school and get orders elsewhere.  Usually, the MOS and/or status isn't as important as the length of time you are on station and whether your family is already with you.  The military has to provide you housing for your family in some form or another.  You should be just fine; just be proactive about contacting housing and ensuring that you have everything they need in your orders so your family doesn't have to move.
e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	This is just my personal opinion, but I believe criminal justice is a waste of your time.  Instead of deciding on a degree and then thinking about what jobs you could get with that degree, you should be deciding on a career field and then choosing a degree that will be most useful to you in that career field.  If you believe law enforcement is going to be your career field, my recommendation has always been to major in business or accounting.  Having a CJ degree will not put you ahead of anyone else with a degree, and most of what you learn in a CJ curriculum will be learned in your police academy and on the job anyway.  If you want to become a law enforcement administrator, the business degree will help you.  If you want to be a white-collar crimes investigator, the business and accounting degrees will help you.  Many agencies actively recruit accounting majors.  Most agencies hire computer specialists and network admins and engineers to run their IT systems.  Sworn or commissioned law enforcement officers are going to make more money than the IT people.  The FBI recruits computer science majors.  Also, most agencies now have agents who specialize in computer forensics, but having an IT degree won't necessarily get you one of those specialities over anyone else.  With most law enforcement agencies, you are a law enforcement officer first.  They will then train you for any specialties they need such as computer forensics, aircraft pilot, or firearms officers.  In summary, if you are considering law enforcement as your career field, almost every agency I know that has a four-year degree requirement will accept any degree from an accredited college, and they will teach you in the academy and on-the-job, what you need to know about law enforcement.  So why waste that college time learning things you'll learn on the job anyway?  You might as well focus on a degree that will give you tools you won't necessarily receive on the job.|`|btdgVKGbaa	A CJ degree might help but any degree will suffice for a pre-law program.

zH0h0Tr0aa	It depends on how far away you live and whether it is a felony or misdemeanor, usually the court will put geographical limits on a warrant and if you do not return to the county they will not come after you, but the warrant will be forever and if you ever return you can be arrested.!~!

If the judge banned internet use or contact with an individual on the  forum you tell the probation officer or prosecutor and they go into court and ask the judge to violate his probation. If the judge does your guy goes to jail.  There is no general federal law keeping a convicted offender off the internet.

If it belongs to you then you are the owner and no ne has the right to misapropriate it or use it without your consent.  Holding onto a person's property can constitute a charge of theft.

Justice requires the rule of law and life without a rule of law would mean that any act or action would be acceptable.  Murder, rape, mayhem, child abuse, etc.    Take piracy.  Somalia coast for example.  Without the response of international navies, the pirates would continue to capture ships, kill the crew, and demand a ransom.  So, is somejustice for victims of pirates better than no justice?      I support some justice.

Check with your local bank. Writing bad checks can be  a criminal offense.|`|AA10925759	Small claims is a bit of a no go situation. You have to inform them of the court date. To file and all of that will require you taking part of a day to do it. Court itself could take all day.     Even if you won collecting the money would be an issue.     Go to your bank and speak to a manager. They will run you through as to how to proceed. It will include getting the law involved. Your bank will look into it as well. Once that ball gets rolling they person who wrote the check will probably pony up the money right quick.

jtPzPhHCaa	Smoking Ban. Pubs were closing down long before the recession hit home.    If New Labour had stuck to their 2005 manifesto of giving pubs the option to be smoking or not many would still be in business. As it was they moved the goalposts after re-election when the electorate had no say in the matter - yet again. I doubt if any smoker in the UK would have voted Labour had they known what Labour intended to do.    Labours 2005 manifesto. Page 66 (word for word):    We recognise that many people want smoke-free environments and need regulation to help them get this. We therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in their favour. We will legislate that all ENCLOSED public places and workplaces other than LICENSED PREMISES will be smoke-free. The legislation will ensure that all restaurants will be smoke free; all pubs and bars preparing and serving food will be smoke-free; and other pubs and bars will be FREE to choose whether to ALLOW smoking or to be smoke free. In membership clubs the members will be FREE to choose whether to allow smoking or to be smoke free. However, whatever the general status, to protect employees, smoking in the bar area will be prohibited everywhere.      A fecking long cry from what they finally imposed. At the last count it was an average of 40 pubs per week closing down.|`|te20MS4haa	Bit of both I think.|`|DBuXLzjLaa	it started since the smoking ban,its worse in this weather too,i cant see why we cant have smoking pubs and non smoking pubs but the govt always thinks it knows best.|`|DsLPE6SMaa	smoking ban definitly but also the price of drink and the introduction of skysports to everyones home and the drink driving restrictions has damaged the pub trade. recession is a very small part of it    there may be less foreign holidays because of the recession but the  recession means more people collecting social welfare then spending money in pubs the night of the welfare payment along with the rest of the collegues they meet once a week at the social welfare office. pubs dont do bad during a recession|`|8dhe15MUaa	the smoking ban shut lots of pubs nothing to do with recession . i smoke and used to go out every night 7 days a weeks . but now i not since smoke free zone came in i not go out . i used to repair beer and soft drink coolers but lost my job last year this was the smoke ban what made the firm i worked for shut down . it true what you say on here we should have a smoke room .|`|wmBK9uASaa	In my opinion it`s the smoking ban that did the damage to pubs....I agree landlord should have been given the choice.

Firstly, when details are revealed, it will inflame others who may be encouraged to undertake vengeful acts of violence against the UK. This will threaten national security both to the State, and to British citizens overseas.     Secondly, it will lead to demands for those who carried out the torture to be identified and punished, and as they are likely to be serving members of the security service, they will be unable to continue their work in secrecy.    Finally, any revelation that the UK Government permitted or condoned torture could lead to a demand for resignations, and might even bring down the government.

eGQw2zGMaa	Tetanus, IPPB(TB Test), Hepatitis, Glemoglobulin (sp) at times, flu shot, polio vaccine.  All I can think of off the top of my head.  People think the shots make them sick, but alot of what it comes down to is all the people from all over the country with different strains of virus coming together.  You get the shots in the first couple days, and start getting sick about the same time, so people just associate the shots with getting sick.  There may be issues here or there with the shots, but I've never heard of it.  There was an outbreak of something a few years ago at Lackland where the AF does BMT; but it wasn't to do with the shots.  Later on you'll get shots associated with where you may deploy as well: Anthrax, Small Pox, Yellow Fever, Typhoid and possibly others.|`|A728LXj6aa	There have been bad reactions depending on each person's sensitivity.  One shot that is undergoing a lot of speculation is the anthrax shot, since there have been repeated incidents where it causes permanent and irreversible health problems.  One squadron of fighter pilots was taken out of commission a couple years ago after having the shot, and my mom's friend developed health problems that the doctors have not been able to solve or explain after having the shot.  That shot is only given before a deployment though, but it is the only one (as far as I know) that is known to cause permanent side effects.    Troy - it isn't necessarily everyone coming from all over the country with their germs, although granted it may be a combination of that and the shots.  I've been in several situations where I've had extended stays (month+) with hundreds of people from all over the world (including second or third world countries, who came un-vaccinated and possibly carrying a host of foreign illnesses), and yet the only times I reliably get sick are when I get vaccinated.

Very few people, if any, are debating that prohibition.    That being said, I'm against ANY further usurpation of Second Amendment rights, including registration, waiting periods, and feel good bans on cosmetic grounds (the so-called "assault weapons ban").  Last time I checked, there were no asterisks affixed tot he Second Amendment.    EDIT:  The ban which lapsed banned certain features which were strictly cosmetic in scope.  Do you truly wish to ban weapons based on the fact that they LOOK scary?  Good grief, at least know what it is you want to ban and the reason you wish to do so.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	To start with, a fully automatic firearm is difficult to obtain legally and is expensive.  There are relatively few of them when compared to everything else.  In terms of criminal acts, they are seldom used despite what you see on TV.      The so called assault weapon ban does not address these types of guns at all, it addresses semi- automatic rifles, which require you to pull the trigger for each shot fired.  That is what has people upset.  If they can ban semi- auto rifles, then semi- auto shotguns and pistols won't be far behind.  I doubt that there are many gun owners who are pushing to have the rules for full automatic firearms relaxed, but there are a lot of us who do not want to see additional gun control laws.    There are over 20,000 gun control laws on the books in the US.  Adding more will not reduce crime.  No matter what you ban, if the criminals want it they will get it, just like drugs and even other humans that smuggled into the country.      As for what a civilian would want a fully automatic machine gun for, well the 2nd Amendment does say that the reason we are armed is for the security of a free country.  The word militia is prominent and that means fighting in battle.  Hopefully that will never happen, either against foriegn invaders or tyrannical government, but if it ever did, as it has in many other countries then a fully auto weapon is exactly what the 2nd Amendment refers to.    You state;   "The 2nd amendment is important, I know. It was also written at a time when people couldn't even imagine a gun that could fire more than one bullet without having to reload in between shots."    True, but then they couldn't imagien electronic media like we are using either.  Mechinism where biased reporting can form US and even world opinion.  But would like us to use that excuse to have all news outlet go back to hand run printing presses and criers in the street?|`|8MUj24s6aa	Full auto weapons are not the problem. Most crimes with firearms are pistols but pistols are not the problem either. Criminals and illegal acts are the problem. There are 20,000+ gun laws on the books right now. If that is true why does Chicago have such violence? And they have a handgun ban.     Instead of banning the guns why do we not ban the criminals.    "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson    http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIEN...    Look up on the FBI's website...the crime rate went down before the Clinton gun ban was made law. It was going down....|`|2gx2LgzEaa	" I DON'T think that they have a right to own fully automatic weapons that can fire hundreds of rounds per second."    Why not?    "What possible reason could a civilian have to own one that isn't criminal?""    Because we can perhaps? its or free and constitutionally protected right to do so, and makes for a well armed militia per the second ammendment, if it ever were to be needed. 2nd ammendment. You should read it.    Consider also, it snowballs. right now the anti-gun advocates are crying about semis. not full    some people collect them? whene did yu ever see a criminal break in using a fully auto?|`|0j9Ggisxaa	Gun control will never be enacted in a manner that takes someones personal property ( guns).  They will just severely restrict ammunition and reloading supplies...

In Israel, their citizens are allow to carry an automatic.      It is self defense when living in a gang infested area.      The police can't be everywhere.  My definition of gun control is to hit the target with one shot.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	there are ways to eventually eliminate guns.  the tactic i feel the left will use will be a huge tax on ammunition.  that will succeed like prohibition!   if they attempt to physically take the guns the S  T will hit the fan.|`|eUdBD4tPaa	Maybe because of things like this:    Date: Wednesday, January 14, 2009, 4:07 PM    Are you ready for the House Bill titled 'HR 45, Blair Holt Liscensing and Record Act of 2009'. It will make it illegal to own a firearm unless it is registered with the database in Washington D.C. As a gun owner you will have to be finger printed, you will be required to provide your DL , SS , you must maintain a valid address at all times, submit to mental amd physical health records being put on file, you will also be required to file any address changes and you any ownership changes even if private sale. Each update will cost $25 and if you fail to comply you will lose your right to own firearms. This bill and its language mirror almost completely one defeated last year in the House of Representatives by soon to be Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. We the citizenry be as lucky this time?     Pass this on to everyone who believes in strict Constitutionalism and remember that laws only apply to those who obey them. Criminals by definition and nature do not abide by laws. New laws and restrictions only apply to the law abiding citizen and are not written with the criminal in mind. With guns, it is not about having laws on the books to prosecute individuals, it is about taking guns away from the people so that no one has them in the first place. One last item to note, when assuming power and creating a facist state, Hitler was a proponent of strong gun laws because a disarmed populace was much easier to control than an armed one. The kings of old also outlawed weapons of any kind in any region that they conquered to quell the ability of the citizens to uprise against them.     The Founding Fathers of this nation understood all of the above and because of this they included the second amendment in the constitution. In fact, they knew that at some point in every society's life span that the need for the population to arise came about. To this end they made they right to keep and bear arms against a tyrannical state an absolute right that could not be revoked. They did this because the first thing tyrants and despots do is to remove a populations right to defend themselves. When this is done the tyrants have no problem with the destruction of society as we know it.     And you really wonder why people think their guns will be taken away?|`|gE03TUtQaa	The gun laws are in effect you know nothing American people do not legally own Automatic  weapons and Haven't since I was around early 1960s only Federal fire arms dealers with a specially licence. Some Wealthy  Gun Colletors have them but they have to have Federal permit and enough money to get a permit.  I know lots of gun owners and have only seen one fully automatic weapon in my life and it was owned illegally.  Why do you ask QUESTIONS with bad Facts?|`|MM8rqTMtaa	One of the reasons for the 2nd amendment was for citizens to have the ability to defend ourselves against a tyrannical government.  When the government gets rid of all of their automatic weapons, then you may have a point.|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	We assume that because the people who push "gun control" have clearly stated that is their intention.

There seems to always be some secret plot going on to strip Americans of their arms.

Also, in LA where I live, I bought my first ever gun (a .357) after Katrina, to protect my family.  However, hearing what really happened with the gangs and THEIR automatic weapons after Katrina I can see that if the 'big one' ever hits here, only the gangs will have realistic arms.      Letting only the bad guys have the powerful weapons is a truly bad idea.  And the bad guys obviously don't care what the 'gun control' laws say.

Check out the bill yourself and draw your own opinions.    If anyone is more worried about themselves than the country, it's the Republicans who decided to vote "no" just to make Obama look bad even after he had conceded to their requests.|`|PPKY3ZLqaa	If the president wants to be elected to anything again...he needs to get the economy going...and he needs to change or be rid of the so=called Stimulus.  Its that simple.|`|HvZt7K5Qaa	Reagan/Clinton/Bush 2 all had terrible first terms and all ended up getting elected again. Clinton/Reagan were awful presidents but such  smooth speakers that we did not see their shortcomings. With Bush 2, Kerry just sucked. So Obama knows that as long as he packages things properly, he can get his second term.     You're absolutely right. What Obama actually wants to have happen is that the turmoil continues for another 1.5-2 years. Then his economic stimulus 'kicks in' and starts propping up the economy (what will probably actually happen is that the business sector will have restructured itself independent of government action). So, Obama gets to say that the damage done by the Republicans was so great that it took 2 years before my plan could start to fix the problem. But, now you have to give me 4 more years so that I can finish the job I started. Even if Obama could fix the economic turmoil tomorrow, HE WOULDN'T DO IT! To do so would jeopardize his chances of reelection, because if an economic calamity hits in the last year of his presidency that he can't fix then he won't be able to blame the past leadership.     See? Brilliant strategy. This is the reverse of what the Democratic congress did towards the tail end of Bush's presidency. They had no intention of helping the economy recover before the election. Obama probably would not have won without more than a little help from the economic meltdown. So the Dem Congress plan worked. Stall the process, and get control of the House, Senate, and presidency. Who cares if some peasants get hurt? You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette. Totally screwed up system (but, sadly, still the best on earth).

They are here just for what they can get and when they are done with the US they go home. So what is the point of giving citizenship to the babies of LPRs? They'll just turn around and sponsor every available family member to come here legally and we are in the same position we are now. Instead of 20 million illegals we have 20 million LPRs, all qualify for welfare, social security, and unemployment. And we have the same population growth problem.  Taxes will be paid, but there will still be more paid out than paid in.  Birthright citizenship should be given to babies born to US citizens ONLY.  According to Jon Kyl R-AZ, "There is, however, virtually no chance in the near term that the Majority in Congress will allow a bill to pass that would deny citizenship to the children of illegal aliens."|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Yes I love it!!|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Yes - but the people in power in DC won't like it.|`|z25aqkDjaa	that 1/6/2009 sounds perfect!  way to go to stop this nachor baby abuse!!!  why is this no more known?|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	I have my own thought on what should happen if a child is born here with illegal parents. The child should be property of the state it was born in. The parents shipped back home. There are enough Americans that want a child and can't have one, that we could sell them one. The money could go toward the deficits that the illegals have created here in the US. through taking tax payers moneys. This would be a win win situation.

9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Definitely the private sector.    Defeating the stimulus package would be good for the economy.  Just imagine what would happen in the markets and the boardrooms of America the moment it's announced that capital gains and dividends taxes are cut!!!  Don't people realize that part of the reason everyone is pulling back and laying off is because they know what Obama wants to do?    Also, defeating this package and enacting a better one would be good for Obama.  He needs to study Bill Clinton's "triangulation" quickly.  If he moderates, he could do good for the country and get re-elected.  If he sticks to the present plan, the country will suffer and he will be gone.    I vote Republican, but Obama won fair and square.  I'd rather see him do right by the country and stay in office than wreck things just to have a Republican get elected sooner.

One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.|`|lr74sHPLaa	private sector hands down, govt only hinders economic growth|`|2Hlctljgaa	No, we need to get the government the hell out of our lives.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	They will both spend it on the third world.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	It will not help any of us.

This is for those who still use antennae    This is from wikipedia.  The DTV Delay Act  will change the mandatory analog cutoff date to June 12, but stations will be free to ignore the extension and eliminate their analog transmissions on or after the original date. The purpose of the extension is to help the millions of households who have not been able to get their coupons and converters because the initial bill failed to provide enough funding, and there are now millions on the waiting list. Funding for extra coupons will eventually be provided in the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill, which with the extension being only voluntary, will still mean that many viewers will lose many or most of their local channels temporarily (instead of all of them permanently without the acts).
8ad6fQiNaa	No there aren't more pot cafe's than coffee shops, that's idiotic. Pot smokers smoke far less than cigarette smokers, and they smoke a mostly pure plant leaf, as opposed to a chemical filled processed tobacco leaf. Forest fires have been started from all sorts of things from campfires to lightning strikes and kids who play with fire.        Last year California pulled in over 11 million dollars from taxes on legal marijauna setups. It's an extremely small market right now because of the fear of federal prosecution, but they still manage to pull in a decent sum for taxes. If it was federally legalized they could pull in billions in taxes easily, not to mention fines that the EPA and OSHA would levy against the business.         It would be better all around if people actually learned a bit and didn't assume that every stoner was like cheech and chong or bill and ted.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	California has about the highest tobacco taxes and very restrictive smoking laws/bans of any in the nation.

What is hurting the environment is the chemicals from the not natural/ synthetic substances being burned such as car exhaust, exhaust from factories and garbage being burned.     Car exhause is your biggest problem because California has such a high population and so many drivers that you have a lot of emissions of gas from the burned synthetic chemicals being released into the air.

This is not a Democratic conspiracy, there are world conferences on this. A world-wide consensus. What about Kiribati? They are losing land at a fast rate due to the ocean levels rising.

Scientists have to be reviewed, read ... published to start their ccareers The sScientificmethod, you are not published unless you provided to scientists committee evidence of what you're talking about.

YOU MUST BE AN EXPERT!!!|`|4uike3ARaa	You are another person who seems to be picking some 'facts' that seem to support your own beliefs, rather than looking at the larger body of scientific evidence that all points toward global warming being a valid theory.   In this regard, you share your podium with the former President, who never let reality get in the way of his policies.  The global average temperature is going up. Whether this is part of or totally the result of natural processes and cycles, or partly a result of human industrial pollution, has not been pinned down.  The Northwest Passage between Canada and the Arctic was almost totally clear of ice this past summer. It is expected that within a year or so, it will be open to commercial traffic.   If you live near a sea shore, you might want to consider moving to higher ground, as the 19 studies I've read all predict rising sea level - the lowest was 11 inches, the highest was 35 meters. The median average came out to 19 1/2 inches. Doesn't sound like much, but a foot and a half rise will flood and inundate coastal cities all over the world. (The studies all used 2100 as the target date for the rise.   So get off your high horse.   Local bad weather does not a climate make. North America is currently experiencing La Nina conditions, which make for more severe winters in the northwest and northeast, drought conditions in the southeast, and the possibility of a stronger hurricane season.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Then the NWO crew globalists who are perpetuating the myth wouldn't have a new religion and a new reason for human beings to be self loathing peasants with low standards of living.|`|AA10465540	EXXON got out of the gas station business, not the oil business.

So no- we still to this day don't know if "reaganomics" works, but economists theorize it won't - it will leave us at equilibrium below optimal employment.      Obama is just calling a spade a spade - he's increasing  spending, increasing M1 (to tweak up inflation a bit, thereby helping to reduce the national debt in the T-bill market) and giving more 'selective' tax cuts.    it's actually kinda/sorta a "kinder, gentler" reaganomics.    Banks and other bailed-out industries have shown an unwillingness to spend the bail-out wisely and for what it it was intended for.  Obama wants that to stop, so he's goin' on the airwaves, and he;ll prolly add teeth to the money spent on the bailout.

Waa waa.  If you're worried about your kids, give up the smoking instead of neglecting their needs.

raImBqwraa	I'm going to assume that by "Combat Arms" you mean, the infantry (03 field). In which case you won't go to MCT at all, MCT is the shorter version of fighting school you go to if you have a non-infantry job, even if it is a combat related job, before you go to your alternate MOS school. Infantry go for a longer stay at SOI as part of the Infantry Training Battalion, ITB. All in all, with boot camp combined, you'll have about 6 months of training before you hit the fleet, give or take. However, the real war training comes after you are in the fleet, its the training you learn from your senior Marines and time spent in the field. The training sticks with you forever. I'm already out of the Corps, but I could still call effective CAS, apply tourniquets and oral pharyngeals, and dis/*** a SAW in about 30 seconds I'm sure. In the infantry - we have no other priority than to learn how to fight and to win wars, so we focus on that a lot :)|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well i am an EX Marine sniper part of fast team reconnaissance, now that is out of the way yes reserves do go threw the same basic hand to hand combat training, as the rifle training you will receive basic rifle training. The training will stick with you for life till you boot hits the grave.     Also on a side note not every marine is a hand to hand combat expert even marine hand to hand combat experts can still be beat, My specialty was in hand to hand and rifles. Even now i can still be beat by some one better there is always some one better as the guns go even a man who never touched a gun and kill a man with 10+ years of training its all on luck.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	I remember in the news a man who served in the Marines during the Gulf War was jumped by three punks in Atlanta who attempted to mug him at knifepoint.

The funny thing was this was in 2004, and his MOS when he served was a cook. His skills and experiences were still with him over a decade after returning to civilian life. So yes, I would certainly say they can fight.|`|z42u6Tbkaa	We're the same man.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Same boot-camp, same MOS school.  The main difference is you'll need a job between deployments.  Sticking with you is up to you.

AA11163314	You may be biting off more than you can chew here.  You would probably be better off limiting the scope of your paper further.

Look at world stability through out the war and gauge if it is a better or worse world because of the war.

Many of us feel that the repeated outbreaks of salmonella and other food poisoning and food contamination incidents that have plagued the U.S. are due in large part to the failure of the FDA to carry out its mission.  There is also a lot of evidence that the reasons the FDA is failing include 1) it has inadequate funding and inadequate staffing to do its job, and 2) too many bureaucrats in the FDA are too closely tied to private industry and are not taking seriously their responsibility to monitor private industry.  The scandal over the peanut butter salmonella outbreak is pretty important from a public health and safety point of view, especially because of this larger problem of which it appears to be a part.
1jUGukznaa	Addressing some of your concerns:    1 - Your home... here, you have a few options.    a - You can put it on the market and see if it sells.  You never know if you don't try.  Yes the housing market is bad, but if you price it realistically, it could sell quickly.  Being realistic, if you lost your job and couldn't make your house payment, the situation could get worse.  Not putting it on the market because of an unknown is to let fear drive your motives.    b - You could attempt to rent it.  Going in the service, this can be tricky, as if a repair is needed you, the landlord, may be miles away.  There are ways around this, though.  Give a specific power of attorney to a trusted relative or go through a realty company that performs renters programs.  These programs are great.  They charge a percentage of the rent, but they take care of everything from maintaining the home, screening the applicants, etc. while you are away.  You could even choose to do this until the market improves and then sell your home.    c - Rent the house out to your daughter and some of her friends.  Granted, this is a tough one.  But if your daughter is mature and responsible, this may be a good option for her AND you.    Bottom line is:  There are many people on Active Duty who own homes.  In this market, or any other market, the service does not want to hear that one can't move if they get PCS orders because of the home ownership.  It's not that they don't care, but being mobile is part of being in the service.  That's why there are options, even if they involve cost, loss, or sacrifice.    2.  No matter what, you're not "booting" your daughter.  She is 18, and I bet she understands.  If she stated that she's willing to live with a relative, etc. then you need to make a decision.  Are you doing this for you or her?  Not trying to be cold here, just realistic.  Also, keep in mind that as long as she's a full time student (carries 12 semester hours or more per semester, which is usually four classes) then she will also receive all the benefits of being a dependant (access to base facilities and the biggie:  healthcare) until she is 21.  So there's that to consider.    Regarding the remainder of your concerns:  A benefit of joining now is that all your time in the Reserve counts towards retirement and pay.  The retirement one, well prepare yourself for a shock.  Even if you've served for 10 years it doesn't mean your half way to retirement.  Depending on the number of drill points you've accumulated, it won't amount to much in terms of the 20 years you need to retire.  But on the pay scale (up top for the number of years in service), it does count, which will help you here and now.  Also, you'll likely keep your current pay grade, unless you're Guard and not Reserve, then it depends on your new position.    Another benefit is you won't have to re-attend basic training.  You'll just receive orders and show up (in uniform, of course) at your new duty assignment.  All moving expenses will be paid.    As far as the bonuses, it depends on the career field (your MOS).  If your recruiter is telling you there are none, but MEPS can answer better, then likely there isn't a bonus.  He/she just doesn't have the balls to tell you the truth (sorry about the brashness, but I'm just trying to be honest).  There is no magic bonus at MEPS.  Hard to get career fields, like nursing, pharmacy, physicians, etc. have bonuses.  Others that don't have re-enlistment/re-commitment bonuses for people on Active Duty are not going to have them for people already serving (enlisted or officer).    As far as the terms:  if there are no bonuses involved, join for the least amount of time possible, even if that means you lose a pay grade.  The pay loss will not be THAT substantial (and you can get promoted the next cycle if you qualify), and if you get back in or to a location and absolutely hate it, you will be closer to filling your obligation.  The last thing you want to do is get back in with a 4 or 6 year commitment and then decide you don't like it and are either stuck for that long or, worse, do something stupid to get out of the commitment that makes your discharge anything other than honorable.    If there is a bonus or some other incentive involved then you have to decide for yourself.  Kind of like any other major decision - you'll have to do a risk/reward analysis.    As far as other benefits, the main difference really comes at retirement.  After 20 years of Active Duty service, you retire and begin getting all the benefits associated with retirement (pension, healthcare, etc.).  After retiring from the Reserve, you have to wait until age 60 to begin getting most benefits (namely pension and healthcare).  Also, the pension is less per month - this explanation would take several pages to explain, but it involves your "time."  In short, a Reservist who drills one weekend a month and two weeks per year serves about 118 days per year while someone on Active|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Putting in for a recall to active duty can take up to six months, that is if your chain of command approves it. There is not much in the way of pay and benefits for a resservist anyway. You sure could not support yourself on drill pay alone and you don't get BAH.    You won't know if there is any re enlistment bonus until you are with the classifier at MEPS.    Your daughter is old enough to take care of herself and can stay in your house until you either find a buyer or a renter. If you get a renter you could give her 10% to manage it while your away.    I went from reseves to active duty in the Navy. It was a big mistake. I should have gone active right from the start. Full time pay and benefits.|`|AA10829482	I'm Air Force so I'll address the stuff I know.     1.  You can rent the house.     2.  Your daughter can start summer school at her university which is a good way to get a jump on classes (they will be smaller and easier to get into), she'll be familar with the campus etc.  She can also live in the dorms so she can start making the break in easy steps.      3. Even if you enlist tomorrow, you may not leave for several months so you have time to prepare.      4.  Could you do Army Reserves full time?|`|2sXUEnzGaa	You should first check with your unit if they can give you a full time job with them. Yes you have to speak to a recruiter about going active duty and yes you wont know about where you go till you or how many years the contract will be till you go to MEPS. The good thing about your home is that the army can put you in the barracks or live off the base where you are station. Your daughter could go to a school next to where you get station and since she is your daughter you could claim her as a dependent, you will be able to get off post housing and she can live with you and just have her go to a college by your duty station. The benefit of being in full time is you will have a job that they cant fire you and will always get a pay check every 15 days plus the benefits. Depending on the MOS the years of enlistment can change and as for bonuses that changes every month. Your reserve unit must let you go for you to go active duty, if they will release you talk to a  recruiter so that they can take you to MEPS to reenlist for active duty

RkfIPD7Iaa	No, you never become a citizen unless you meet all the requirements.      There is a residency requirement for becoming a citizen, but residency does not make you one.|`|AA10045620	No, it is not true.  Many other steps need to be taken before becoming a citizen.|`|Gezfmghuaa	That is not correct in general (there are a few exceptions).  Assuming you are in the US legally to start with, you need to follow the procedures to apply for citizenship, including the exam.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Not true at all.|`|151feabc1b6b09c214a5f6d185c62090aa	No becuase my parents are from Africa and they have stayed here for more than 13 yrs and they arnt US citizens.|`|CowgOqXTaa	No, it isn't.    Richard|`|se4sNWxFaa	No it is not true.  There is no default citizenship situation in America.  You have to go through the legal system, apply, reapply and apply again.  It is very costly and a cumbersome process.  It all depends on where you are from and how you came into the country.  If you are from Europe it takes less time than if you are from Latin America, Africa or the Middle East.

You do not have to be a politician to have that character, whether anyone notices that or not.    The real accountability is in the hands of the higher up above us all.|`|35R9DS4laa	There are many thing which the people don't know about Indhira Gandhi. You people are aware of the positive qualities Indhira Gandhi.. but people dont know about some of the negative things that she did against the nation.    Do u know she put the nation on emergency only to save her seat. There was no other reason for declaring emergency during her term. And therefore after that there was amendment in our constitution that no PM can declare emergency with the consent of President and cabinet.    And for these kind of negative rolls she had to sacrifice her life..|`|AA12264002	Of course you are correct!

b8uYVhVMaa	Your appraisal is normally done by your line manager.  If he/she is the one you don't trust and respect then you can request that someone else does it, however, as this person is your immediate superior then they will be the one who knows what you do and how you do it.    If you believe that they have given you a bad appraisal then you can escalate it to his boss and HR.    j|`|AA11206283	uh...you've confused your employer with the government. your employer puts a review process in place. He puts the people HE WANTS in charge. YOu can attend; and appeal any result or not. He can fire you; or not.|`|Fex51ntIaa	Wait until you see what the appraisal is. You have to agree to it and sign it before anything can be done with it.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Sure, you can refuse. Of course, they can make your continued employment dependent on your participation.    So, as long as you don't mind the possibility of losing your job, you can absolutely refuse to participate.|`|AA10887916	In most appraisal systems, particularly those operated in the public sector, there is an appeal process.  I suspect that if you refuse to participate, then the process will go ahead without your input and any appeal you then have will be significantly hampered by the fact that you did not use the opportunity of the initial appraisal to put forward evidence of your positive achievements.  If, however you do participate and disagree with your grading then, as i say, most systems have an appeal process which means your case will be examined by someone at higher grade than your original appraisor.  Once that ruling is made, then that appraisal is set ins tone unless you are unionised and can provide concrete evidence that your grading does not reflect your performance.|`|AWSmknxLaa	The company decides who reviews you.

A: You don't have any legal position. Not getting along with someone is not legal grounds for not having your appraisal done by them. Do you realise how silly that sounds.    Q: the appraisal determines whether or not I get a pay rise and is very specific. I want to know if I can refuse to participate in the appraisal. thanks for your help    A: I would very much doubt you can refuse to participate. But what you can do is dispute the appraisal if you feel it is unfair or unfairly reflects you as an employee. At that point you would raise it with a manager or union representative I suspect.    EDIT:  ____  It is not offensive to say that something sounds silly. You may be offended but then you must realise it is silly. My reply as was still stands. Not liking someone doesn't constitute a legal position.|`|H4PQ8nsfaa	If you refuse to particpate you are potentially open to disciplinary proceedings.You cannot refuse because you do not like your boss or he/she does not like you.    Appraisals (performance reviews) are not governed by any specific employment law rules.In my experience ( I have done many ) a lot of managers are not very good at appraissal.They are not trained properly and are not objective enough.They misunderstand the process and how to do it properly.Likewise employees are not well prepared or fail to understand that it is (or should) not be about do I like/get on with this person.That said you still have to do them.    A well designed process should allow employees to have their say and challenge in writing any unjustified written negative assessment.Even a negative appraissal cannot result in dismissal.So a legal issue does not immediately arise.    Failure to get an expected pay rise following appraissal does not give an immediate right to claim unfair treatment in employment.The most you can expect is to have a basis for a grievance procedure if the review is not done properly.
