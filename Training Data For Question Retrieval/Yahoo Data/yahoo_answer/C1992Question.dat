20090307165634AALXzOp	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	On blu-ray movies, is the whole movies supposed to look different, or just different scenes?	I am wondering if I might have hooked this ps3 up wrong or something.  I'm not seeing that big of a difference comparing regular dvd's to blu-ray movies.  I bought the hdmi cables thinking that would help.  Is there something else I can do to improve the picture?  My tv is a sony bravia if that helps.

I bought a few DVDs today and read some articles online telling me how to rip the DVDs and convert them to MP4 format so I can sync them to my iPod, but it takes way too long and I don't have the time to do all of the steps to get the DVDs on my iPod. There's just one movie I want on there at least, if I can't get them all and iTunes has it for $10. The thing is, if I already bought it, I don't see a need to pay for it again; if I contact Apple and show them the Proof of Purchase on the DVD, would they allow me to download the movie for free?      Like I said, I don't see any logic in paying for a movie I already bought just to put it on my iPod. I don't want to waste time calling Apple just for them to tell me it isn't possible, when that (if you ask me) is nothing but a fair thing for them to do.      Any help would be appreciated!
20090307181615AATNTwS	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	What is the minimum requirement of a woofer to be able to listen to high quality bass ?	I love to listen to Tabala more particularly played in Indian songs and Indian classical music. As you might know in Tabala, there are two instruments, one is Dagga which makes lower frequency sounds and the other is Tabala which makes higher frequency sounds. The combination of the two makes the music, however, to me the sounds coming from a Dagga are more interesting. To be able to listen to these sounds which are in 'Bass' category, I suppose, one needs to have woofers in the speaker system. My question is, what is the minimum specification requirement of a woofer so that one can listen to a high quality bass ?

20090307182247AA8ZIEg	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Can the transferring of two different xbox 360 hard drives between one console cause problems?	My Xbox 360 just had a hardware failure and a friend of mine just recently unplugged my hard drive and used his own to play his game on my console. I just bought a used 360 today and I'm wondering if we were to transfer hard drives back and forth with this new one if it could potentially cause another hardware failure. I don't know if the hardware failure on my old xbox was because of the transfering of hard drives or if it was just unrelated and a coincidence.

20090307184748AA4JlAg	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Troubles with my PS3?	Alright, so I know my PS3 is probably done, but I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone else might be experiencing the same problems, etc.      If I have a disc inserted when I turn my PS3 on, the system doesn't recognize it. The little disc icon doesn't even pop up. I have to either take the disc out and put it back in or just wait 'till the system is turned on to put a disc in. Second thing is that when I try to start a game (such as CoD: WaW or LittleBigPlanet), it freezes a lot of the time (more often with CoD). For example, sometimes it won't even get past the "Loading" stage of CoD. The little loading animation is still moving, but it doesn't seem to be getting anywhere. When this happens, if I press the PS button, the XMB will pop up but none of the icons load. There's only a bunch of those little twirly things (if you know what I mean). When this happens, I have to restart the console.      Anyway, it's really pissing me off, so any feedback would be nice.

Here's the deal, when I add my mp3 collection to Windows media player it scrambles my album artwork up really bad, I tried to fix it but gave up. well I tried again yesterday, and again it scrambled everything up, but this time it messed up all the album artwork and ID3 tags in my perfectly organized itunes library *Screams*, Now when I try to re-edit the album artwork and tag information in itunes it won't stick, it will look like it works until I play the song, then it goes back to the way it was. The only way to fix this I have found is to rename the Id3 "title" to something else then rename it back, then it will work in itunes again.      So my question is, is there a Id3 tag editor program that will allow me to rename all 1300 of my songs Titles? All I need to do is add a single character to all the songs and then remove it. I found some that will allow me to rename the title of the file, but I need one that can rename the ID3 title.      I vow to never use WMP or zune software again, theyr'e garbage.
