20090223024635AABva1u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love or revenge hehehe?	ok heres the story when i was still in 3rd year i met this girl in our school who is really beatiful.now i tried to be friends with her now that i am friends with her i ask her if i could be her suitor and she said no because there is this guy who i think is her classmate that have always tried to be her boyfriend and never succeeded and she told me that it would be unfair if she would give me the shot.Now lets fast forward we are now in fourth year and the guy that i told you about is already her boyfriend.Now my question is for example her boyfriend and her would end their relation then the girl would see me again during our 1st year college and she would be shock with my appearance(because im fat)now that i slimmed down and i look like joe jonas.do you think i would have a chance to be with her just asking.hehe thank you for those who will  answer
20090223024713AAlAeTU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does an ex realize he is following you around?	My ex boyfriend of many years has been driving by my apartments and jobs (there have been a few of both) over the last couple years and driving to match my schedule and leaning over to look at me.       Not enough for me to be scared but enough for me to notice. And enough not to be coincidental. He knows that I know he does this. I ignore and then try to talk to him about it - which he denies. He has a new family.      Does he realize he is doing this?

20090223024727AAOIvh7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My professor sleeps with students... what do you think?	I've been wanting my professor for about five months and I just found out he was sleeping with a student last semester (thanks to that girl's best friends). I'm not altogether going to let these girls defame him... but I'm taking it that he wants me because he's been hitting on me, and he tells our class to fantasize about me. Despite the fact that he's not available and a senior citizen... what would you do if you were attracted to a professor if he slept with students? Would you do it or even initiate it?
20090223024956AANlHxe	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Im really afraid of him! Please help?	I am in a relationship for a year with what i though was the man of my dreams. Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work, i work ever hour i can to be away from him. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i don't know if i believe it though. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him.Another day when i was going out he put me up against the wall. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, Im only 25 i don't need to be scared of someone who is ment to love me. He has been arrested a few times. Please help me with advice in how to go about leaving.   Thanks alot :)
20090223025004AAdyjf7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found his ex-girlfriends new number in his new phone!!!! What to do??	My boyfriend who I live with just bought a new phone and the next day we were playing with it and I noticed an unfamiliar number in his contacts and I called it, it was his ex-girlfriend's!!!!!!!!! (and it's her new number, how did he get it????) Ok, he swears he hasn't done anything with her, and I know she doesn't have his number or anything, but why would he feel the need to have her number?  They have no ties together.  What should I do?  Do you think he is cheating?  I'm sooo confused.  Any words of advice please!  Thanks!
20090223024958AAWA7kB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS!!! Am I looking into this too much?	I am dating this guy who always compliments me, he says I am fun to be around, he can't resist texting me (drunk texts) and he said i can come over any time I want. Now I think it is just a "smash and dash" type of deal where I go over there rock his world (which he always says he loves the sex) spend the night and leave the next day. Once I stayed until 10 pm where i rocked his world but then we stayed in bed all day. My friends tell me that he wants more than mind blowing sex all night and he wants a relationship. I think we are just hooking up (but wouldn't mind a relationship). So guys, is it a hook up or does he want more? How would I know the difference between the two. (I'm bad at relationships and reading guys)

20090223025929AATb1gc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could I do better or should I just settle?	ok, I am a very attractive women, not conceited, just telling you the truth.. and if I go out, I am always approached by several guys asking for my number. They will then ask me out on dates, keep in touch etc.. now I am obviously single.. and I am looking for someone who really sweeps me off my feet and I am so happy and excited to be with, I want to feel that attraction and spark!   I am not exactly jumping for dates with these guys, they are ok, but not the spark that I am looking for!       Am I searching for something impossible? or should I just settle with whoever reasonable asks me out? or should I wait?      I just don't want to be with someone when the one I am really attracted to comes along.. and also when you are in a couple, you go out less and don't meet new people!

20090223030045AABNtmU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I show signs of being a "Commitment Phobic"but not in one previous relationship?	Ok in discussion with a love interest he was saying about seeing a psychologist about being a commitment phobic..I looked up the signs and symptoms on Wikpedia, and the description provided sounds eerily like me.      In all my relationships except for the one, it was on again off again, I want the marriage and long term relationship but I am constantly picking the wrong man.      The one relationship that i had that was healthy ended suddenly and we were together for 2.5 years and a accidental pregnacy ended it. Oddly enough I wasn't bitter at him for leaving and I have forgiven him he has never hurt me. We talk all the time and are looking at being together again.      Was this relationship where I was happy and not showing all the signs of being commitment phobic the "one" he is not perfect but to me he is? Should I consider giving it another go? I know we are not the same people and I know we are not going into the same relationship as before.      I am 36 and been married 3 times. Cheater no 3 hubby, Hubby no 2 Cheater and Hubby no 1 verbally and physically violent.

20090223030106AAHkrbl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When do I give up on the reconciliation?	My wife and I had a short marriage which produced a child.  We went through a nasty divorce and bitter custody battle; however the divorce has not been completed.      After the custody was settled (50/50), she drug the divorce out by not submitting documents and eventually contacted me about trying to make it work.  The first few months were great.  She was the person that I originally fell in love with.  That lasted 2 or 3 months.      Since then things have been pretty much on the same as before.  Sex is boring for me, but exciting for her.  She admits that I satisfy her always, and feels bad about not satisfying me.  My only pleasure in bed is how well I satisfy her.      There are other issues and believe me sex is the least of them, just the easiest to explain.  We tried counseling three times before we filed for divorce; however never went for many sessions before she gave up.      Before we got married I dated women that made me much happier, and even after we split I've date much better women...however I didn't marry those women.        Right now I feel that this reconciliation is going no where and I'm willing to give up on this and just finalize the divorce.  Separating was my idea after being married for 7 month.  Divorcing was her idea...and reconciliation was her idea also.        I hate to quit on her when she's trying, but I'm not happy.  Do I try more or just quit?

20090223031300AAmxd7x	Family & Relationships;Family	Does My Really Dad Hate Me?	Well.. I'll probably be here for awhile if I listed everything, But.. my dad is emotionally, physically and finacially abusive towards my mom. He has tried to kill her with an axe, cro-bar and about anything he can get his hands on.       He has had an online relationship with a woman in America, for about 3 years and my mom thought that they were just friends, until she found out they he had sent her a $100 gift for christmas and was having cyber sex. He hasn't even met the woman!      Well.. he hasn't spoken to her for about a month, and he has become a totally different person. He ignores me and my mom, and is constantly putting me down, he tells me i'm useless, idiot, worthless and a mistake.       Just tonight he told me I had to get off MY own computer, and that if I ever want to talk to somebody on msn, from now on I have to tell him who they're and what i'm talking about -- WTF?      When I started crying, because of some other things he had said, my mom walked in and asked what was wrong, he lied to her right infront of me and said that he was just telling me to clean my room, and stop crying over it and acting like a brat!      When he was really telling me to get his permission to do anything! He hardly talks to me anymore, and the last time I think he has said "I love you" to me was around a year ago, the last time he said "I love you" to my mom was probably 7 years ago.       I asked to sleep at a friends house, the other day and he responded with, "Why not, it's not like I want you around here"       I seriously just want to know, why my dad hates my mom and me, so much.       He had a previous relationship before my mum, he was married with two kids, they split up when the oldest was 14! the age I am now..      He cheated on that family, with my mom, and now i'm afraid he'll leave us to.      Sometimes I just want to die, I can't talk to a counseler about this because, it's not really important aye? I mean who cares if I was to kill myself, because I know I can do it..       I talked to my school nurse and asked if I was depressed she just shrugged me off and said it was puberty. Do all kids with puberty feel like they wanna die nearlly 24-7 and have a plan for suicide all planned out, and have actually harmed themselves before?      I just feel so confused?!

20090223030711AATc4VT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get my girlfriend to stop being immature? HELP!?	I am 24 and my girlfriend is 22. We have been going out for 3.5 years. She is Spanish and I am English. I moved to Spain to be with her 1.5 years ago. She lives with her parents I live with 3 flat mates. She has never lived with me. I want her to move in with me but she has been unemployed for 6 months after university and does not search actively for a job.      She lost her virginity to me three years ago. We never have sex. Probably once every 5 weeks. We never really have either. She says it hurts. She says she will go to OBGYN (she never has) but never organizes it, she said to me recently she is calling for an appointment. To give you an idea about how little we have sex I took her to Barcelona for Valentines day weekend, stayed in a 4 star hotel alone and we didn’t have sex. There is always an excuse for not having sex and if there is not a clear situational excuse she is ‘tired’ ‘doesn’t feel well’ and if they are not available ‘not in the mood’.      I feel I can’t trust her around other men - she says nothing happens with them. She went abroad to the UK for 3 months and I stayed in Spain just less than a year ago. When she was away I suspected her of cheating although I never had any hard evidence she strongly denied it. She knew a few extra moves in bed she had never used before with us among some other factors which made me suspicious. I said to her I was worried and she stopped using these extra things now she only sometimes she uses them by mistake.      When she was there she rarely talked to me and when she returned from being abroad she treated me extremely badly.      I sometimes even think my girlfriend is cheating on me right next to me. I thought that this weekend with a man when we were out. If I mention my worries and concerns to my girlfriend about these things she gets angry and says I am insecure without listening to me or my feelings or she says ‘i don’t want to talk about this’.      She is very immature sometimes. On Saturday night instead of taking her car to my city and staying in my house after going out partying, we walked 2km to meet her friend’s dad for him to take us in his car. Her friends dad had to be woken up , have a shower and put on his clothes after working all week. Then she wanted to take the first train with her friends at 9am instead of staying with me in my house. In the end she stayed with me as she didn’t want to wait 2 hours for the train.      She says she loves me. How can I help her grow up? Commit to me? I feel like I am waiting around for her to be a women not a little girl. I don’t know what to do. Any advice appreciated.
20090223030426AAWzhOp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is he cheating on me?	I'm having a real problem with something at the moment and wondered if anyone on her had any advice.  We've just moved to a new area and I don't have any friend round here so I don't relly have anyone else to ask.      The thing is, I think my boyfriend may be cheating on me, or more accurately, thinking about cheating on me.  We have a brilliant relationship, I love him to bits and he tells me he loves me all the time.  We've got a two and a half month old daughter who he's amazing with, she couldn't ask for a better daddy.      We've just recently both signed up to facebook and he's been contacting a lot of people he used to know in the army.  One friend he's got in touch with has a neice and he's started texting and for some reason I'm really paranoid about it.  I also read a message on his email from her just saying xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx roll on april xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx      Am I just being paranoid and hormonal and should I say anything to him?  This is really depressing me, I keep imagining myself as  single mum and I don't think I could do it.      Sorry about the long message I'd just really appreciate any advice if anyones got any.
20090223031316AApqCR6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over an ex boyfriend?	Okay so we have been broken up since November last year we went out for 8 months but were semi on and off for a year before that. Basically I was in love with him and I still am. Doesn't help we have slept with each other several times since the break up (bad I know) but now its just doing my head IN. I cant stop thinking about him and he never talks to me just comes around when he wants sex and I never have the heart to say no well.. because I love him. and Im sick of it. I constantly sign on msn to see if hes online, and even if he is he never talks to me anyway!    he was  a bad boyfriend but still doesnt change the fact that hes the first person I've properly been in love with before.. Im 20 so nothing before hand or anything.    I just dont know what to do now.. its getting really emotionally draining. hes the first and last person i think about everyday and he broke my heart and seems to be doing it all over again..    so please.. any tips???    I just cant handle this anymore!!    sorry about the rant.
20090223030456AAq1RrJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend likes to Dress Up...?	My boyfriend likes to cross dress, but only in the bedroom. Before we started dating he admitted that he was gender confused and wouldn't mind dating a transvestite and he found some men attractive. but after we started dating, he denies it and says im the only one for him and that he is straight. but we still do the dress up thing and he is into humiliation and stuff.. i play along for him because i love him. i was thinking for a birthday gift.. what if i got a transvestite to play along with us..? they have something to offer that i dont and have the same mindset he does, so they can relate and will know what to do and how to go about it. although he may say no at first, i really think he'll get totally into it and love it! im a little nervous about it, but i thought it would be a nice surprise. ive posted an ad on craigslist and have multiple replies from transvestites who want to meet and "greet"... what do you think?      ps: we are in a committed monogamous relationship, but i really feel there is something he really yearns for that i cannot provide.. i love him and want to see him pleased and happy 100%.

20090223030716AAc8njB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Met a new girl from an online dating..?	Just met a new girl 2 weeks ago, have dated a few times and all is well but two things came up and need advise on..      First, she has been married 5 times and of course drew up a red flag, seems like she rebounds allot and second, she is also in counselling on her divorces and relationships as well.      My friend also has dated the night before with  someone she met before me...was told it did not go well and I believe ..      I guess the question is, is she ready to date or should I just lay back, I am playing this dating of her very low key, just do not want to waste my time on a problem girl, thanks to all so very much!
20090223030249AAF8tKg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? How could this short time do this to me?	Okay so heres the long story short. I went out with this girl for about 2 weeks + everything was fine then i had to leave town for a week because my dad was in the hospital with a heart attack. Some how I knew I was loosing her. So I asked and she yes you are. So then I change my thing on myspace to singe. I was so worried about my dad my mind was in another place I couldn't deal with it all. Then I get a message wow its over? Okay. That was it. Shouldn't she of been there for me??       Then life goes on I guess. Now its the year after she gives me back rubs, hugs. Then out of the blue on night we kissed. The thing is I still love her. Even though all what happened.       I was a long in the hotel room with not knowing if my dad would see tomorrow and things just end. I'm so confused I haven't got one good night sleep in over a year because of this. Each night I run over and over it again. I loved her. Things always feel right when I am around her. I'm a nice guy I'm outgoing, friends with everyone, ill always be by your side, the guy that just wants to be with you and talk about nothing. Why did this have to happen to me? Ever since we broke up my life has when down hill. I still love her. And I don't know what to do. If we didn't kiss maybe things would be different. She was my first kiss at 17. Advise and anything that would help me out would be great.

20090223033615AAYXCdV	Family & Relationships;Family	Should i feel bad that i don't want to visit my parents?	okay, so here's the deal.. i'm 19 and i moved out of my parent's house about a year ago. i now live about 3 hours away and they don't approve of me moving out. anyways, they constantly find excuses for me to come "home" and visit them and make me feel extremely guilty if i don't go visit them.       my sister who lives in another state is coming in for a visit and my parents of course want me to come in also. but the thing is, i really, really don't want to. the whole time i'm home i am bored out of my mind (my parent's house is literally in the middle of nowhere.. the closest store is 30 minutes away) and they also corner me and have "talks" with me about how im such a sinful person blah blah blah (the biggest sin i commit is i drink occasionally, my parents are very religious) and they just make me feel guilty the whole time im there.      AND if i do go visit them the earliest i can leave will be in about a month, ill seriously go insane if i have to stay for a month!       i love my parents they are good people and i don't want to hurt their feelings. they have always been there when i needed them and they have always treated me well.. but i just can't take the guilt that they maek me feel when im with them. i visit them for about a week on every major holiday and i plan on visiting them for Easter.       soooo does anyone have any suggestions for a good excuse for me to tell them so i don't have to visit them? im currently unemployed but i sometimes babysit my boyfriends niece..       blah. suggestions?

20090223034539AASpqjv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ex friend posts photos of me from my youth with mean caption? What can I do about it?	the photo isn't bad- it is just what is says under the caption which is rude, and it makes me seem evil- because me and this girl are not friends- it says when i was nice and when i was there for my friends and when i didn't turn my back on my friends.    silly isn't it.   i told her i wanted the caption taken off- i realize she has the photos. i don't care about the photos- its just that caption- and a lot of people can read it and see what is under the caption and probably think i am not a good friend.   she has tagged everyone else to these photos but me.      i sent her an email telling her i wanted them taken down- she has not responded-      she did take the pictures- i just don't like the way i am being represented with the caption.
20090223033108AApbRCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Second date question?	hey guys. I will tell you my short story and then want your opinion. appreciate all your answers:   I went to work in a restaurant (only for a week). on the first day I really liked the girl who was working there. next day I asked her if she is doing anything on Sunday night (she was working on sunday) and she said no. I asked her if we can go out and she said maybe.finally I got her number and we went out after her work finished. she was very warm and friendly. I wanted to make her talk more but she asked me lots of questions about my life. I made her laugh a lot and I think we had fun together. We were together for 4 hours and then we hugged and went to our separate ways. now my questions:   1. how do I know if she is single? is it possible that she thought this is just a night out not a date?   2. how do I know if she liked my? any special signs?   3. I will try to arrange for a second date. I am thinking of getting her a small cute bouquet of flower. what do you think? roses?   thanks in advance

20090223034440AAM6hS5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The girl I'm seeing likes another boy more...advice!?	Hey guys, heres my situation      I have been getting with this girl for about 3 months now, after she got out of a 3 year relationship.  Its been going really well we've been hanging out and sleeping together and I was aware it was only really a bit of fun but was kinda hoping it would develop into something more.      Anyhow, I found out the other day a guy she really really likes has come back into the picture, and i confronted her about it saturday, resulting in a bit of confusion between us both.  She doesn't want a relationship, I know that, but she probably wants to carry on seeing me.  What shall I do?  I feel like I'm second best to the guy she really likes, till she actually manages to get the guy and cuts me loose? Shall I call it a day? But I really like her so shall I just keep it casual and see how it goes? Even though I can't stand the thought of her and him together.      I'm meeting her at 1 (just over an hour) for a chat.      Cheers guys

20090223033202AAzhrsJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does my husband think it is a big compliment when i hear he tells me this in an argument (read on)?	My husband tells me "I choose you out of other ladies... i tell you mostly everything than anyone else"      It is pisses me off because i think in my mind does he think i am supposed to be happy hearing that and should take it as a compliment.      The way he talks is like all these girls like him when we he brings it up  in an argument and he choose me. But there are men who like me but i do not boost nor does it unfold to mention because the way i see it is   from when i chose him to spend my life with then he is number 1..there is no other. Why mention others like they are.      I do not know if i read into things different as he has got his own perspective, way of stating things which he may not realize he is giving out the wrong interpretation which pisses me off.      MY QUESTION IS:      HUSBANDS AND WIVES, IF YOUR OTHER HALF SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO YOU SHOULD I PRAISE IT OR IS IT DAMN RIGHT A DISRESPECT?      I do not take it as a compliment...so i would like to hear your views, has this happened similar to you or what is your view of the male or female species in regards to this.

20090223033147AABQNpF	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am not sure what to do in this situation :S?	To add a bit of detail I am going to tell you about a story that took place in 6th grade.      There is this kid I never hang around him. Anyway, I once told him by MSN are you my friend. He said "Yeah man. I'm your friend".       At school, he would usually hug me sometimes. One day after school, he had his hands out for a hug and I blocked him from hugging me and he yelled out "I just got rejected from him!".      On the way home from graduation practise, he sat next to me I said "Should we start coming to each other's houses." And he's like "Yeah, I will come online so we can organise a time."      Anyway, he came on. He went off and I left him an offline message saying my phone number so he could ring me. He went on then off again without saying anything.      Then we went to graduation and he shook my hand at graduation. We were leaving (this was at the end of the night) he pat my shoulder and said "Love you bro".       Then I went on MySpace waiting for an answer off him. I sent him a message on MySpace saying my phone number and everything again.      He hasn't replied since and he hasn't been online since January and hasn't been on MySpace since January. He hasn't read my message yet. Also me and him are going to different high schools so we can't contact each other.      I asked a close friend of mine who is also a close friend of the kid. I said to her "don't say i asked" and she showed me the conversation and he said "He is a nice kid and I feel sorry for him because everyone bags him." It is true though.      What do you think he would be thinking in this kind of situation? Would he REALLY be my friend? Wouldn't he? I mean, what do you think he thinks of me and what should I do? Thanks ;)

20090223033205AADgO3Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will he call or text me back?	I went out on Saturday and met a bloke made what looking back was an unwise decision and he came home with me. My flatmate also got with his friend. We slept together and it was really nice he kept telling me he really liked me and really pushed for us to exchange numbers. On Sunday he stayed over all day and we just spent a lazy day in bed he was really attentive and happy to hold hands and be really affectionate. he asked me what my plans were for the next weekend and said he would like to come and see me. Everything seemed really good and I felt really positive. He left at about 5 on Sunday afternoon and I taxt him at about 9 to see if he had got home OK and told him I had had a really good night. Well surprise surprise he has not replied I feel really stupid and think that now he was just feeding me lines to get his leg over and have somewhere warm to sleep off his hangover! Need some male opinions as to wether you think he will text/call or if I should forget about him and move on??

20090223033447AA4fKVC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	" there's someone that i fell inlove with me but i think she's not talking to me anymore"?	there is a girl in my school, she was so beautiful! she has the face of angel and as gentle as an angel too. we've been friends for almost a year. until i knew that i was already falling for her!the thing is she has a boyfriend! i didn't knew what to do when i knew that i really liked her so i just acted like i didn't really loved her. after a while i noticed that our relationship is getting closer until i told her that i really LOVE her! (even though she has a boyfriend! i just didn't know what to do i just tried!) and that she's the first one that i fell for, i gave her a letter and a little bear. she was so surprised! and i told her if she would love me back! she cant say a word! she just said this was so sweet of you! i really liked the bear and the letter. when i did that my heart pumped like a drum! i was so scared that our relationship will affect this. when i was about to leave she told me that she cant because she has a boyfriend! (Oh Man!)  i really thought that you will really love me! we talked and talked and talked and she said that its 10:00 and that she has to go home, so we went home. the next day our relationship got closer! she hangs out with me more frequently than her boyfriend!and i noticed that they fighted with each other! i saw her alone and crying!,(so i did my work, i knew what i have to do! i have to comfort her!) so i went to her and talked with her! she doesent want to talk to me! so i just said: always know that i'm here for you! i'm your bestfriend!, your shoulder to lean on! come on! i know that you are afraid to talk to me cause i'm inlove with you! just talk about it! it will just get worse! just talk to me! so i saw a tear fell from her eye so i wiped it and told her to stop crying and we talked about their fight. then after a few days she said that their okay! until i gave her letters. i told her a letter will be given to you each day to signify my love to you! until i saw her tearing all my letters (Ouch) i just stopped making letters and asked her why???? she sid that her boyfriend doesent like her accepting those letters! oh man! i was so heart broken! i didn't knew what to do! my grades fell down! she doesent talk to me more frequently! its like my life was wrecked! i am still broken hearted until today! february 23 2009.

20090223033605AANbGVA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a good cute way to ask a girl to prom?	P.S My name is Adam and her name is Melissa.      The Question          The stressed, ecstatic environment of looking for that perfect dress, perfect group, perfect party, and perfect night. The time when all of the store managers scream, curse, and attend confession twice as much as girls by the dozen come pouring into every known dress store known to humankind in search of that perfect dress to wear on this fun and joyous night: the night of laughter, fun, and friends. The night of hearing those annoying phrases from your parents, “ oh she looks so pretty,” “ oh he looks so handsome,” and “ oh they look so good;” followed by a flash of a dozen pictures from the parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and whoever else wants a picture of their new family member’s rendevous into the unknown zone of Prom, and this only preludes the even more dozens and dozens of pictures taken by your amazing friends and more dozen of phrases of “ oh you guys look so cute.”    Afterwards, the dance begins and the laughter and the smiles reverberate throughout the night as your friends scream and shout, making prom the best night ever. The dancing and the music, the talking, and the eating surrounded by all your friends make Prom worth wild.    This is what an ordinary guy named Adam sat thinking about all day, about the chaos, mayhem, and fun of Prom. He thought about who he should spend this chaotically and crazy fun night with. He then thought of a girl named Melissa. She was clearly the best choice, but how could Adam ask her , that was the question. So after many thought-provoking nights, he finally thought of the perfect way to ask her.    After Adam figured out the way that he would ask her, he had to figure out when he would ask her, but that was the easy part. So Adam finally had it all figured out; his mind now began to daydream about it. He began to dream again about all his friends, the laughter, his face glowing bright red from the embarrassment moments provided by his friends and family, and the thought of going to prom with her, Melissa. Now, only one thing remained: the question. Will you go to prom with me?

20081223060631AA0FBwk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	True or false: We cannot MAKE someone else happy. We only ADD TO others happiness?	I see alot of questions on this site about how to MAKE someone like them?? How to MAKE someone happy???    I learned a long time ago that you canNOT make someone like you! They have to want to do it themselves! That being happy is an INSIDE job. It's up to every individual to create their own happiness. Others only add-to their happiness. It's too much of an unrealistic burden to think we have the capabilities to be responsible for someone else's happiness.

The story goes like this- We were in a relationship for 6 months+ and I recently propose to her on valentines day.We didn't start of as friends,but boyfriend/girlfriend.Every thing was going smooth until the day she started to lie and eventually cheated on me.   She confessed that she had 2 other boyfriends when she was mine.I wasn't angry at her for lying and cheating on me behind my back but I gave her some time to think about all the wrongs she did.A few days later,she broke up with those 2 boys and came back to me.She promise me that she'll never cheat or lie to me again and she wants me no matter what,that's why I propose to her......   I thought that she had changed,until her this other guy came along.1st,I didn't suspect anything because they were just friends.Then a week later,she started to have feelings for this guy and decided to be a 2 timer again(behind my back).Then 2 weeks later,they had sex.....   but I didn't broke up with her yet,I just gave her some advise and told her to avoid that guy.   She was avoid the guy for a few weeks only,and she was starting to text him a few days after I propose to her.   I started to have doubt in her and started to ask her lots of questions bout that guy.She eventually got fed-up of my question and asked me to not to talk bout him.She says that she's nt a 2 timer..it's a lie.   I keep on asking questions and called her frequanlly.....then she said that she had enough of me and broke off the engagement.but she agreed that we are still boy/girl friend...   Yesterday,I saw her making out with that guy who had sex with her.......I was really heart broken....I care bout her and trully love her,but she doesn'y give a ****....      So,I broke up with her and start to ignore her..but I still got feelings for her and my feelings for her won't fade away.   I don't want to love her anymore,I want to move on but it's so hard!!!

20090223034556AAeTFBd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I overreacting?!!?	i've been with my bf for 4 years now. we are both 30 and I have 3 daughters from a previous marriage that he treats as his own and loves very much.       I finally moved in with him (officially-my lease terminated at my apartment last month but i've been practically living with him for the past year). he's seemed really excited about us actually living together-helped me put all the furniture up in the girls' rooms and was really happy (I am too).       the problem is, I feel like we've drifted a bit. I know it's mostly due to things being so hectic w/the move,jobs,kids,etc. add to it I get really bad pms and it's that time of month again so the past few days i've been really weepy and overanylizing things.       he's never been super emotional when it comes to cards,emails,etc. for valentine's day he got me a card that said "I chose you as my valentine b/c you're the only one who truly understands me-and you like me anyways." this upset me b/c I felt like it was a card I would have bought for a friend-not someone i've loved for 4 years. that's been gnawing at me bad since yesterday (again-hyperactive hormones i'm sure).       yesterday, we were making love, things were almost perfect until he ran his hands up my arm and I thought he was going to interlock his fingers with mine (something he used to do alot b/c he loved me so much) but he didn't-he roll my hands into fists and held them that way. that killed it for me-I wanted to cry. so I stopped us and rolled over. I got dressed w/him asking me what was wrong. I cried and told him nothing felt the same anymore. he just didn't treat me in the overly loving manner he used to.       instead of holding me close, kissing me,etc to make me feel better-he tried pulling my clothes off again telling me that I needed to feel his skin on mine so I would know that we loved each other very much and things were ok. I got very angry with him and screamed that he was making me uncomfortable so he stopped. hours later, we made up and ended up finishing the lovemaking session.       I still feel raw and upset about the whole pulling my clothes off incident-I know i'm over emotional right now due to my pms but did I over-react?

20090223034900AAlCOHI	Family & Relationships;Family	Mum walked out on Dad?	Hi my mother has suddenly walked out on my father after 25 years of marriage for no apparent reason. My dad is a cool dude, does everything for her, for the family, a Role Model.      I'm 23 and I have a 10 year old brother. Not so much about myself I am worried about my father that has not family near (unlike my mother who has all her family around). He is now alone, I'm out of the country with my girlfriend and he has restrictions as to when he can see my brother. I spoke father last night and he is really affected by it.      I have lived 20 years with them and must say everything looked good and in all fairness my father should have walked out ages ago and not the other way round. I fully support my father, and I am encouraging him to see this as a good thing as my mother has been very ungrateful towards him and all the things he does.      I still can't believe my mother has just this for no apparent reason whatsoever.      My question is: What can i do to help my father? What can be done so this is not so traumatic for my 10 year old brother? Should I feel responsible in any way for not being there with them and being away carrying on with my life?
20090223035014AA5RCpY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found out my BF went to see "Slumdog Millionaire" with a female friend... how would you feel?	I'm really torn on this one. My BF and I have been dating on/off for 7 months and I recently found out he went to see "Slumdog Millionaire" with a female friend. (I have a feeling she is an ex, since he doesn't really have other female friends) We had a rocky start, but it now makes me rather uncomfortable now since it's a romantic movie?       We have a semi-long distance relationship, so I'm trying to be cool, yet it's hard b/c I don't know exactly what's going on sometimes. I know he sees other female friends as well, for stuff like lunch and dinner. I have a feeling one of the friends still likes him. On the otherhand, I know he has a female jogging partner, but she has a boyfriend (who I know) so that one is 100% fine.      What would you guys think? I'm trying to trust him but I totally am not used to this.  I brought it up once or twice with him.. and he seemed upset that I couldn't trust him. I've read other forums where the ppl say I have to totally trust, otherwise I'd be too insecure, jealous and the relationship is doomed. Then I read other forums that such a BF is playing me and dating other women.      What do you think? He's 37, I'm 30. Mature answers only please. Thanks.

20090223035835AAxGu6z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love is blind... in a BAD way?	So... I have 2 do this speech in the topic 'love is blind'.      I believe that love really IS blind, in a way... but the BAD way.      When I say 'the bad way'... i mean that people 4get about themselves and could die 4 the person they love ... eg romeo & juliet... look at how much pain they gave their families. you end up loosing so many things u have.. sometimes even lose urself.    Also that you don't see the bad things in them that normal people do.. only good things- which means that ur playing games with ur own life.      So, what other things can I add?   Are there any useful websites out there?      I really appreciate the help anyone gives!
20090223035839AAvb20Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if you had found out this?	I am getting married next year to a lovely woman but I need hep trying to sort something out in my head. She had dated a guy three or four months before we met and it was al done and dusted before I came on the scebe. I had problesm at the start of our relationship as I missed my kids from previous marriage so we split for a month or two although we did keep in contact. I moved back in and she had told me that her ex had called on the house phone twice since I had been away but she had told him she was not interested and to be fair in the three years since we have heard nothing. Before I split with her I bought her a mobile and gave it to her. I have found out recently that his name was on the contact list but the no. had been deleted. Now if he caled on the home phone why would she have put his details into the new phone. I think she removed his no. as she let slip that she had all his details on her old phone. She does everything right in the relationship and shows me all the love and does plenty for me but I am worried about this. Should I be??
20090223040357AAX1f6k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Hi, My wife is not in love with me anymore. She does love me very much though. How can i make her fall for me?	We have been together for 5 years, i met her when her child was 3 we now have 2 kids, she fell out of love maybe a year or two ago, she is an amazing woman and its entirely my fault. I have done some very bad things in the past although i have not cheated, i have done things like have pics of women oin my phone etc. I went through a period where i was paying her no attention and showing very little love. Now however i feel i am a changed man and i wish i could spark up our relationship, i have been doing the flowers and attention and pretty much showing her she means a hell of a lot to me. I know she loves me and would never cheat but i want that spark back any more ideas.   thank you
20090223040338AAZTUsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get over this issue...?	About 7 months ago, my girlfriend and I broke off our 3 year relationship together. During the time off, we both did our own thing. Mine with random women and her's with a guy from work. Since then we have talked and agreed we both want to be back together. About 3 months ago, we cut it off with the people we talked to during the break up and decided to move in again. Everything is actually going great, even better then before. But I can't get over the fact that she slept with this guy who she sees everyday. Is that selfish of me? And is it immature to hold a grudge or view her differently? and lastly, how can I know that her's is over? (and We are both 28 years old..)

We both have spoken about out future plans (children, home, where we live, etc.) I cant see myself leaving him and i know it'll be really hard....but lately it's been so easy for us to get into arguments, to catch attitudes and all of that. Something I never wanted to be like with him. I can feel that things are different, and everytime we speak about it, it gets all emotional and we're good again for another hour before it starts all over. It's turning into a relationship that i've never wanted to be in. I'm afraid that the longer I'm with him the more I'll fall in love with him, and the less of a chance I'll be able to get out in case things get worse. Please help....

Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work, i work ever hour i can to be away from him. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i don't know if i believe it though. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him.Another day when i was going out he put me up against the wall. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, Im only 25 i don't need to be scared of someone who is ment to love me. He has been arrested a few times. Please help me with advice in how to go about leaving.   Thanks alot :)

She is a freshman in college, and she has never really drunk anything before. I am mad at her because I told her she was going to get drunk and cheat on me. She said she wouldn't, but I knew she was going to do it. I think my girlfriend is also mad at me because I got into a fight with her parents, and they hate me now. They want talk to her because she is dating me, and I think she blames me. I don't know what to do. She was extremely drunk, but I don't feel like that is a good excuse. I use to drink a lot so I know what happens. What should I do?

20090223000212AA87JhP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Today my long distance girlfriend was really upset because one of her male friends who she had a 5 year?	friendship with stopped being friends with her for some reason. We will call him "Eric", Eric pretty much called her today cussed her out said "we ain't straight anymore" and they hung up and that was the end of their friendship. She told me that a girl that she hates who we will call "Alexia" started a rumor and "brainwashed" Eric to not be Jena's friend. So I asked well what rumor did Alexia start she says "I don't know". I asked What did Alexia brain wash Eric to think about you? She said "I don't know". I asked when he called and cussed you out what was he cussing you out about? She said "I don't know". The thing that bugs me is I'm pretty damn sure she knows exactly what happened and what rumor Alexia started, and why Eric no longer wants to be her friend (whether it is or isn't true). But she won't tell me. So I'm thinking she doesn't want me to know for some reason, but can't think of any good reason. Do you think she honestly doesn't know or she just doesn't want to tell me because I'll get pissed or something bad?
20090223011005AAqWy7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have to confront her about this?  Or just hope she gets over it?	One of my closest friends has been worrying me since she broke up with her long standing boyfriend recently.  We're both in college, she's on internship 4 hours away at the moment so we haven't seen each other often but...      There already have been a bunch of signs.      Here's the big one.  She's TERRIFIED of wrists (and needles for that matter).  Example:  Someone grabbed her wrist cause she was hitting them (playfully) and she yanked her arm away and stifled herself from screaming.      When I mentioned that my hands were cold on our walk she instantly reached out and grabbed my wrist to pull out my hand from my sweater so she could hold it.  I've never seen her hold another person's hand PERIOD let alone even touch someone's wrist.  Add in just touching me a lot more in general and being far more vocal then usual and I'm worried about her.      What can I do?  Do I just pretend not to notice and hope she gets over it?  Do I have to confront her about it?  Or is it possible that I'm overreacting?

My bf is obsessed with lasting ages in bed which isnt a bad thing but sometimes i feels he holds off . Its like his ego takes control  when i like things to flow naturally and if hes holding back from me to make it last like if i go on top or give him oral he has to stop it .      He has issues he says he cant imagine sleeping with the same woman his whole life which is just plain stupid then he will say i could spend my life with you.

Are there any signs I should look out for?

20090223040958AAoyysK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I would like to know how this works......(Very interesting question)?	because its not something you can easily ask somebody. I've known many cases like this. Say a couple meet and start dating. Maybe 3 months, 6months, a year later, the woman becomes pregnant, either accidentally or she actually wanted it to happen. Do many couples on average, discuss their sexual history and the possibility of whether either of them should get tested for STD's before ANY of this happens? I mean once the pregnancy occurs, thats it, if either of them had an STD, then the other one has contracted it too, as unprotected sex has obviously been had. I'm just wondering how many couples actually think about these things before a pregnancy occurs. Is it something that doesn't even get discussed? Or do more people than I think go as a couple to get tested early on in relationships, only obviously they don't shout it from the rooftops!! I'm interested to know.
20090223011940AAUx923	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long term boyfriend issues, help!!! Does he even care about me?	My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost one year.      I moved away from my hometown to be with him, leaving behind everything except for my vehicle and small belongings.      He is currently going through a bankruptcy because of bad debts from his prior marriage.      He had an opportunity to sign away his vehicle that has a high interest rate on it.        My credit rating is perfect and so we were able to get a nice place to live together      I just recently signed another 1 year lease on the home we are renting together and he brought up the fact that he was worried that I might leave him.      This stems from the fact that I offered to buy him a car that was free and clear of any debts if he decided to sign away "his" vehicle to the bankruptcy deal.      I have literally given my life away to this man that I truly love and he is afraid that he will have "nothing" if I get mad for some reason.       I am truly frustrated and insulted by his fear that I might leave him, when I am legally tied to the terms of the lease on our home!        We are currently splitting our rent up, and I don't make enough money to make ends meet if he were to "leave" me.      Now I'm wondering if he cares about me in the same way I care about him.  For the thought of me leaving him even CROSSING his mind has me baffled.        He says he loves me, but I am afraid now that he might leave me and I'm considering breaking the lease and moving on.        What should I do in this situation?

20090222223957AAhsZ2C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over this stupid stuff?	Im a 16 year old guy.      Ive had about 4 gfs, and none of them have been too serious except the last 2, one of which was a ***** and basically used me, and the other is the girl im dating now who is pretty much awesome.      I have always fallen for people fast, and I think too much.       Ive said i love you too 3 ppl- first gf tht went absolutely knowhere, ***** girl, and the girl im with now.       The girl im with now has been my longest relationship, and i really care about her, and think I love her, and could see myself with her a long time, and shes the girl ive fallen hardest for so far, and she said i was the guy she'd fallen for aswell. Her friends tell me she's never been happier, and that we're perfect for eachother, and that im a good guy, and we both deserve eachother, etc...      But now im scared somethings gonna happen thats gonna ruin it... Its always amazing when were hanging out, my insecurities go away, and im 105% happy. But when im not, i miss her and get bad thoughts, and think the worst always..        Im mostly scared that I said i loved her and didnt mean it again, and that if I do mean it, that it will fade over time, and that someone will get really hurt... and yeah.. wat do I do to get over this???         Im really happy with her, happier than i was with anyone else, i just stress over stuff alot. And im not unconfident/etc, im confident as ****, but i like her alot, and dont want anything to come between us.. We kinda talked about this the other day and she told me she did stuff like this sometimes too, and that shes getting better about it[[shes dated alot of jerks]] because shes knows i wouldnt cheat on her like several of her past bf's have and yea... i told her i wasnt goin anywhere for awhile, and she said it aswell and that she wouldnt let anything get inbetween us, and I told her the same, and yeaa.... How do I get over this??

20090223004958AAPJkCL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell him the truth or not?	(This is a long one, but I'll answer yours as well. Just link me)          So I met this guy a few months ago online. I gave him a fake name and stuff at first. That's one lie he hasn't forgotten. I haven't seen him face to face yet. I'm still getting to know him just because I'm extremely cautious with the whole online meeting thing. It's me first time. He's seen pictures or me and I've seen pictures of him. So tonight I was out with my friend, her bf, and her bfs guy friend to play pool. I'd never think in a million years I'd come across the online guy in my town since he lives in a diff town.       Anywho, so he had text me twice when I was there, but I just looked at my phone and ignored it. I didnt think much about his texts, but I did notice a gentleman that kept looking my way. It was dark, so I didn't make out his face all that well. I thought he was a stranger just looking my way. No biggie.       Once I get home, I decide to respond to his texts saying 'Oh hey I was sleeping.' I didn't wanna tell him I was out with my friend and all that. He's been trying to see me, but I keep putting it off until I'm ready. He sort of has feelings for me. He questioned it. He was like 'Oh really? I swear I saw someone who was your exact twin.' I reassured him it couldn't have been me since I was sleeping.       Now I feel really horrible because he's a nice guy. I'm afraid of telling him because he'll be crushed and upset since I've been blowing him off and since I was with other dudes. I don't want to tell him and have it be another lie.

20090223021206AA93zf9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it normal for me to feel like this?	i have two really good groups of friends, one in school and one out  of school. However, one of my in school friends is starting to make friends with my out of school friends.       this migh sound really stupid but it is really annoying me. like the minute i get closer to one of the out of school friends, my other friend begins to talk to them, and wants to become really close to them, even if she has never met/talked to them before!      is it normal for me to be feeling annoyed/jealous about my friend making friends with my out of school mates? and is there way i can tell her 'nicely' to get her own friends?      thanks :)

20090223024711AAoq9dZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't my girlfriend commit? PLEASE HELP!!?	I am 24 and my girlfriend is 22. We have been going out for 3.5 years. She is Spanish and I am English. I moved to Spain to be with her 1.5 years ago. She lives with her parents I live with 3 flat mates. She has never lived with me. I want her to move in with me but she has been unemployed for 6 months after university and does not search actively for a job.      She lost her virginity to me three years ago. We never have sex. Probably once every 5 weeks. We never really have either. She says it hurts. She says she will go to OBGYN (she never has) but never organizes it, she said to me recently she is calling for an appointment. To give you an idea about how little we have sex I took her to Barcelona for Valentines day weekend, stayed in a 4 star hotel alone and we didn’t have sex. There is always an excuse for not having sex and if there is not a clear situational excuse she is ‘tired’ ‘doesn’t feel well’ and if they are not available ‘not in the mood’.      I feel I can’t trust her around other men - she says nothing happens with them. She went abroad to the UK for 3 months and I stayed in Spain just less than a year ago. When she was away I suspected her of cheating although I never had any hard evidence she strongly denied it. She knew a few extra moves in bed she had never used before with us among some other factors which made me suspicious. I said to her I was worried and she stopped using these extra things now she only sometimes she uses them by mistake.      When she was there she rarely talked to me and when she returned from being abroad she treated me extremely badly.       I sometimes even think my girlfriend is cheating on me right next to me. I thought that this weekend with a man when we were out. If I mention my worries and concerns to my girlfriend about these things she gets angry and says I am insecure without listening to me or my feelings or she says ‘i don’t want to talk about this’.      She is very immature sometimes. On Saturday night instead of taking her car to my city and staying in my house after going out partying, we walked 2km to meet her friend’s dad for him to take us in his car. Her friends dad had to be woken up , have a shower and put on his clothes after working all week. Then she wanted to take the first train with her friends at 9am instead of staying with me in my house. In the end she stayed with me as she didn’t want to wait 2 hours for the train.       She says she loves me. How can I help her grow up? Commit to me? I feel like I am waiting around for her to be a women not a little girl. I don’t know what to do. Any advice appreciated.

20090223004652AAIueI0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS : What are some signs that you want out of a relationship?	I have been with my BF for a year now. And we just moved in together. He has been acting strange lately either out of his own insecurity or because I think he wants me to break up with him. Let me tell you, I have broken up with him before. 7 times in the 1 year we have been dating and everytime I did he would break down, start crying, we would come to an agreement and stay together. It's confusing me and I just want him to tell me the truth .. does he or doesn't he want to be with me? Because I can find other guys and their are other guys that would love to be with me. I tell him I love him, he tells me he loves me then why is he acting this way. He says he wants to have kids with me someday, marry me. He told me this towards the middle of our relationship. Is he having 2nd thoughts?? I don't know. What I do know is I want the truth. Because I don't want to waste my time when another guy would not behave like this with me so I can feel happy and less stressed. I love him so much, I have showed him in many ways and done everything I can to make it clear. I told him all of this and he said he still loves me and is attracted to me, that he loves me living with him.      So guys, my BF is confusing the hell out of me and I don't know what's going on but it is becoming painful. What are the black & white signs? I need to know, no more games.         btw strange, as in behaving upset for no reason and moody.

20090223020832AAKnA9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he a player or not?	What to do if the guy that you're seeing seem unsure about you, then when do you walk away or stop waiting (mentally check-out)?  I've been dating this guy for like 2 mos, been seeing him 1x, or 2x a week. He acted like a player at first and when I confronted him about it, he said that he's interested in exploring relationships w/ his dates and not into wasting time. Fine. When we do meet, it's always been fun, interesting, all good. When we don't, he never or hardly ever calls, asks me out on IM (yes, on text), calls me every week or other week. He wants it to be casual. Once I called him and he said that he's busy...ouch, that really hurt. We already got intimidate a few times. I really like him. He seems to have many mental issues (bipolar, depression). He's 39 (office manager) and I'm 32 (analyst). I just never know if he'll call me this week to ask me out or if i'll never see him again. Is this normal in today's dating world?? He tells me that once he decides to be in a relationship, he becomes a great boyfriend. He seems to want to control the shots in the relationship too. He says that I'm cute & attractive and that I could prob get other men if I wanted.      He won't go exclusive w/ me, does this mean that he's just not that into me?  Does it in all reality seem like I'm wasting my time? Does this sound normal btw people who are seeing each other casually?    Please don't tell me that I deserve better...I know that!!!...but this is my heart and he grew on me and I really like him. Just be honest, esp if you're a guy, what is he thinking?  Thanks!!

What would you spend it on? Cigarettes, gas, food, drugs, etc?      I would spend it all on gas, and try to eat some 30 cent soup for a while, so I can have a decent amount of gas to drive to college for a few days.

But the other day I bought a bag at our neighboring store and the guy who rang me up knew where I worked and made a comment about something I had worn the day before. Then the next day we both were working and I found him staring over at my store quite often. Then he came over on his lunch and chatted with em and my co-worker.

20090223044030AAOPKoR	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think that it is ok for a mother to keep a father from seeing his child?	I have a friend that has gone through alot with the father of her child. She still loves him because they have history together, he was her first partner and relationship. Their child is now 7, he only wants to see the child when he feels like it. Whether it is Christmas, the childs birthday or when one of his other children have a birthday party. We call him the holiday or special occasion dad. She has gotten over the fact of them being together and just wants him their for the little boy more than just every now and then. It seems like when he can't have her like he wants her, he really doesn't call or come around to get the child. And when he found out that she was seeing someone else, he kind of got an attitude. She is now in a better place financially and emotionally. She wants to move to a different apartment and is looking to start over. She wants to change her number and just raise the little boy by herself as she has been doing so for the past 4-5 years. I don't really see a problem with that if he is not there on the regular nor do I think that he should be mad at her for doing things this way. But, I also feel bad for the little boy. Cause he is stuck in the middle yet, he is a happy child and doesn't seem bothered by the fact that his father is not there. Do you think that she should move on and continue to play the part of both parents or should she let him continue to come around 2-4 times out the year and pick his child up. I also, forgot to mention that he lives in another state but, is only 21/2 hours away but, is always in town. He also, does not call to see how the child is doing at any time. What do you all think?
20090222232852AAkP0WS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did he take me seriously or not?	two of my friends and I like the same guy.

Then we continued to do our school project like nobody had said anything and it was just like normal. Do you think he believed us when we said that we like him, especially since all 3 of us told him.   P.S. I used letters in brackets to not use the peoples real names, they would be annoyed at me if i didn't :P

She claims exactly the opposite. She is a very skillful manipulator and tries to make me feel guilty during an argument. We never have a discussion; only arguments.

This I did thinking that she would feel more empowered. Now she is far better off than me and I am no longer the provder.Do you think I lack the courage or fear what lies ahead if I break up ?

Basically everything is really complicated. 1 month ago, he said to me that he really, really liked me a lot. He said that i was nice and funny and just so fun to be around, None has ever said that to me. I went threw a really bad experience with a past relationship, so i said i just couldn't commit to a relationship this soon, and i said that our friendship was too much to risk.       But sadly i fell for him......      I was planning on telling him my feelings for him....    Now he going out with this girl Nicola. Uh!     I was really cut and upset.      I couldn't hold my feelings in any longer so i told him over text about my feelings. I wasn't expecting a relationship out it either. ( I'm not the type of person to date a person in a relationship, i thought it was fair that he knew, since he told me)      His response was:    I use to like you as well, but after you kinda turned me down, i was sweet with that, got over it and now me nicola have something very very special, i'm sorry but i love nicola. we can still be mates, but i love nicola, sorry.      I said: Ok well then how come when you said you liked me as much then how come it took you a week to get over me and find a new gf?.      He said: I didn't love you.... just liked you a lot.   and just wanted to see where we would go.   But i love nicola. I'm sorry. I don't think it will ever be like that...    I want me and nicola to work.       Now it's awkard and wierd. I didn't reply. I sent a text saying that i was unable to come to his party, and i will send his card in the mail.      I just don't want to see them together, because it will hurt me.    and i've been hurt many times before.      Did i do the right thing?. Or any advice suggestions.. please all will help.      Please no rude comments. Thanks guys, sorry that it's really long.

20090222235632AAYVCuH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, please help!!!!!! Relationship questions again..?	Me and my boyfriend just got back together after we broke up for a week. I was the one who stormed off and told him not to ever talk to me again. The past week i spent sulking and asking him to give us another chance. Last night we finally got back together. However things are a little different now..Good and bad kind of. All the frustration that we had with each other is gone (at least on my part), but he also seems pretty distant. Not when he is with me but when we are apart. We used to talk all the time throughout the day, but today i barely heard from him. I know he was busy, but still... what can i do to make him forgive me, and bring back that spark that we had??
20090222233103AA9soGS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong that Im attracted to older guys?

20090223030701AAgO4WS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do? What would you do? My future has changed dramatically (girlfriend).?	Okay. To start things off, I'll add some background info. I'm 16 and so is my girlfriend. We're both pretty good with our grades, and we want to stay together forever. We started having sex for the last 2 months and the last time we had sex...we had an accident. It turns out she might be pregnant...bodily symptoms, and missed period.      I'm fully aware that what we did could bring unexpected consequences if we weren't too careful, so please don't give me that negative crap that won't help.       We talked about the possibilities, and we decided that abortion/miscarriage isn't an option. If she were to get pregnant, she wants to have the baby because her parents would support her in raising it. She would miss school for a while...and I figured she could make up credits through online courses.      Now I know a plan is good in handling situations like these...but I'm still concerned about our future.      Basically, my question is for reassurance, and a sense of guidance if you will.      We both plan on going to college (Where? I don't know) but I'm scared...truly scared in how I'm going to handle a baby in our future. My question(s) is...what do I do from here? Do I finish college, sustain a living for the two of us, and then let our baby come into our reality?      So what I'm really trying to ask is...what would you do in my shoes?    -I would really just like some guidance right now, thank you. Sorry if this was long...I'm pretty sure I could've shortened it, but oh well.
20090223011443AAeNoYU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why cant i hate my ex?	I know i should. My friends say that she treats me like crap. But why can't i hate her?

But as soon as her needs are taken care of, she goes back to ignoring me until she's bored again. Why can't i hate her?

Now I can't get the picture out of my head...He was 40 and she was 29. What kind of a woman does that? While she's married, even though separated and while she's on a break with her steady lover with whom she had been cheating on her husband for 3 years.

I really like her and she says she really likes me, that she likes how things are going with me, and that she's lucky I didnt give up on her when I could have (ive liked her for awhile). Coming off a romantic valentines day evening at the beach we have been less communicative this week. It made me kind of come off as needy, but she said she didnt get sick of me but she has just been really busy. I decided to back off and give her space and haven't spoken to her in 2 days now. I'm afraid she'll forget about me or something, but dont want to be clingy.      Do you think she's just been busy like she says? Am I at risk of her forgetting about me and how I make her feel? Its like I want to give her space, but I'm paranoid that I'm doing damage to what we have going (which seemed really good). What should I do?

The thing is, I don't think I'm ugly, I don't have low self-esteem (most of the time haha).    It's just that she plays a lot of guys, more power to her  I guess, but she's already hurt so many guys that I feel didn't deserve it, yet they always come back.       I guess I'm asking because every time I hang out with her and some guys, they always pay more attention to her, maybe I need to be more outgoing? Who knows.. any advice is welcome. Thanks.

Its weird. but my girlfriend of 2 and a half years says she doesn't know me, and that i have changed. I have changed but I feel like im only getting better. I used to a lot of drugs, and now I still do, but instead of everyday its more like once every 2 months. I stopped for her. I work out a lot, and my body looks nicer now, and I can last a lot longer during sex, and I worked out for her. my grades are really improving. I am more easy going now, so don't argue with her as much, but now she says that she doesn't know who i am anymore, and that shes gettin bored. I was just kind of curious what the hell does it means when she says she does know who i am. Im still the same person. i'm just getting better. so why is that she bored of me now that i'm a better person, compared to before when i was just some lazy pothead. before sometimes i didn't even return her calls. I just don't get it. If she loses weight or starts dressing better, I like it. i don't complain

I had gone for a coffee yesterday with about 20 girls(lesbians) and I met someone who had caught my attention   Of course, I've spoken to her online before and it was because of her that I had gone yesterday..   Well,we didnt talk much yesterday as she was at one end of the table,and I was at the other end   But she kept smiling at me though   And, she sms-ed me saying "Hey, I'm sorry I didnt speak to you much today. Gabrielle did warn us not to talk to the people we already knew"   Then I said "It's okay, prolly you and me could hang out sometime?"   She replied saying "Youre free tomorrow?Wanna hang out?   And I said "yea,lets hang out"      And today she canceled on me saying she was sick   I've also cancel-ed on her once before because my school had ended late   Before yesterday,we never used to talk much on msn coz she was pissed at me for cancel-ing on her the other time   But now, after the coffee meeting..She never fails to make it a point to talk to me on msn.   What do I do?   She's always on my mind.   Do you think she likes me?      Im a girl btw      Yes, I do belive she was sick coz she told me the night before that she had a flu..and I could see frm her face that she was really not feeling well

20090222221617AAxRtM1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys only answer.....?	I just got married to my husband.  before we got married he was always telling me how I don't give enough of myself to him. the way he sees it (if i love him I will do stuff for him) and as a girl I think if he loves me he'l show it in effection and lots of attention. Him and I have already established we need different things from each other. well, I've accepted it I've done so much for him I constantly am trying to think of ways to make him happy and it's never enough he always has a reason why what i did is wrong I didn't do it right I payed 5000 for (something that will not be mentioned) for him because he said he'd do anything for me. if i did and he'd pay me back and all our past issues would b put behind us and blablabla. well I've done alot more than that for him and I know he seems like he's using me.  but that's just his personality (hard to please). I can accept that but I need somthing to work with and him buying me things does not make me happy those r material things.  to him that's everytihing to me it's nothing.  alls I want is for him to be sweet and effectionate and never take me for granted not even for a second. anyway I'm trying to make him appreciate me what should I do and say? we bn together 4 years and have a daughter.  the last thing i want is mind games but he uses them on me so how can I reverse this and make him realize hes beind a D**K?

He was a great husband and dad, but it all changed he got  on steroids and the moods of his became unbearable. We was married 16 years and together 21 years. But i can't be with hin anymore he took my children for over 30n days i had no contact at all with them and he did not put them in school. I did get my children back but to me that is unforgiveable because i didnt know if the kids was ok or not. But they are ok now. My middle child was always my baby now she is very distant from me she was told that i did not want her or love her. She does go to ccounsling well anyways we have been seperated since august 2008 and i am hoping and praying that the divorce is going to be over soon. My question is i want to date but since i dont have signature that i am divorce i feel like i am cheating on him. I havent loved in a long time and i just want to be free of him, but all i can remember is the guy i once married and i am afraid that no one will compare to him of what he was before the steroids. I know i need help LOL!! but i am a easy going person and i really never get mad. I am trying to find someone that is honest, fun, active, loves to ride motorcyles, boating, racing and kind of racing. I even like sports i know crazy. But how do you know if you will ever find someone like that. Also we was pretty active sexually and i miss the intamacy and just the cuddling and all that stuff. I dont want him back cause now he is a ugly person i just want to be able to feel again and i am getting that lonely feeling. When my children are with him that is when its the hardest then when they are home i am prettty much ok but i do miss  the male embrace and hugs. thanks for reading

20090222235800AADNJlw	Family & Relationships;Friends	So called "friend" making threats, how to deal with it?	I have a so called "friend" who is a very spoilt little boy really, he is 19 and always had everything he ever wanted, the problem is he is slightly unhinged and goes off on one at the drop of a hat, and if you ever say the word NO to him, oh dear... be warey!      His birthday was recently and i wasnt able to go out for it as i had made plans with my fiancee months previously, which i wasnt going to cancel. The next day i received a message calling me all the names under the sun, to which i replied and told him to grow up.      Next thing, i see him drive past me and i receive a message saying "you are lucky i couldnt turn round in time".... now, he is involved with some very "questionable!" charachters so obviously i dont want to bring trouble to my own doorstep, but on the same note i arent going to not go out anymore incase i see him.      Him on his own, i dont mind, i know for a fact if he decided to make a deal out of it, i would put him in his place, but its the repurcussions after this with his "questionable" friends. There is no way i am apologising to him because he didnt get his own way, so how do i go about dealing with this one?

20090223002356AAp3NO7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I have this strange feeling when my girlfriend leaves my house?	usually after we made out.. It's a feeling of satisfaction but also this subconsciously worried feeling, what's up? Am I worried if I did everything right or that I hope she feels the same way about me? I don't know it's strange, maybe cause I think I miss her so badly afterward.
20090223003038AAfwJod	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to say thanks for the date but no thanks...?	I went out with a perfectly nice guy, and had an okay time... but not really worth doing again. I want to say thank you for taking me out and showing me around the city, but not lead him on to think we could be more than just friends... is there a good way to do this. Not acknowleding it seems rude, but I also don't want to encourage anything.
20090223002911AAbZWDL	Family & Relationships;Family	Help, this is tearing me up inside!?	My cousin, who is only 13 years old, is in a downward spiral. She's been having sex with lots of guys, stealing from her parents, and worst of all, doing drugs. It seems like nothing can get through to her. I don't want my aunt to overreact, because I already know that she will. I want to help her get off this destructive path and find her way back home. And don't tell me that there's nothing I can do. All you naysayers and idiots, go away from this post. Anyone who is willing to help, help is appreciated.      I was hoping to try to get her saved. But I'm so torn up inside that I have no idea what to say or do.

I'm a 29 yr old single mum from south australia and I would like to have another child but don't want to get into a relationship.

20090223003015AA5ywdI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long distance crush. is he avoiding me?	I recently met this guy online and we've been chatting for these past couple of months. We recently exchange phone numbers and talked on the phone couple of times in one day than after that we stopped. I called him and texted him but no response. But there was one time when i texted him saying in a joke way "oh i see someone is ignoring me maybe i shouldn''t call or text him anymore", he called me back right when he saw the msg but after that phone call i have never talked to him since. I even tried calling and texting again. is that a sign of him trying to avoid me?
20090223003637AA7qIjO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In a defacto relationship, are both parties liable for debt even if it is in one person's name?	I have been with my partner for 4 years and we have been living together for 3.5 years. He has been able to gain work permits and so on because of our defacto status, however because he is not a citizen, he does not meet bank criteria for lending and so we have 2 loans which we both pay that are in my name only. We also lent my partner's parents some money when they were in hardship - around $3600, which is supposed pay off some of our debts when we get it back.      I have been thinking about ending it with him for a while but have not because of the financial ramifications. I would like to know if he is liable to pay for half of the debt if we do break up, and do I need to get this in writing? Also, what right do I have to make sure that his parents pay the money back and that it goes into pay off the debts?

20090223003858AAWB45Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there a difference between my boyfriend looking at other girls and looking+comenting on how pretty they are?	My boyfriend said when he's with his friends, he points out girls that he thinks are pretty. I'm already a little insecure.......maybe really insecure, and I'm trying to explain to him how that makes me feel. It makes me feel like he's not happy with the way I look, but likes how these other girls look. Am I over reacting or do I have a valid point about it adding to my insecurities? And does anybody else find it inconsiderate and disrespectful to me for him to point out the girls to his friends versus just keeping that thought to himself?

20090223005441AAyQgM4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Long distance marriage?	so here is the situation. Me and my wife haven been married 2 years coming up next month. but after about 16 months or so i left her. and after a month or 2 of complete silence or yelling over the phone we calmed down and started talking again. and now for the past few months we've been working our problems out and we have decided that we will get back together. since we made this decision i have no idea why but she has been bugging the crap out of me and annoying me and its the stupidest stuff in the world. like she grills me about going out to bars and hanging with my buddies. because when we where together she wasnt ever able to get me to go out with her or her firneds to clubs or bars, and i didnt haven any friends. so since we moved away i decided to stop being anti-social and make some friends. well some of these friends are females and are added on my myspace so my wife is freaking out. i can completely understand why so i told her ill stop going out until where back together. then she was starting to question MY bank account. since we split i got a new job and my own bank account so she keeps asking me what im spending my money on and id say whatever i want to...its my money. she didnt like that answer obviously. to make this long story short since we said ok we'll get back together she has been gripeing about everything possible and its driving me nuts and making me have 2nd thoughts about getting back with her i live in texas she lives in north carolina. she will be in texas in 3 weeks for about 7 weeks and at the end of that 7 weeks we're suppose to go back to north carolina together. but like i said im having some issues here. is this just a long distance problem and it will be ok once we start seeing each other again? or is it more? i love her i want to be with her and i want this to work out...but im not going back if this is how its gonna be. i mean is it normal for a wife to question my bank account, where i go? who im with? and call my cell phone about every 30 mins or so..

20090223005655AAivM12	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I introduce myself to a girl online that I wish to meet offline?	Here's my story: I have just been messaged by an 18 year old friend of a friend that went to high school with me. She has just messaged me on Myspace and even though I would like to get to know her offline and online, I am just too shy for words right now and I don't know how to introduce myself to her. I realize that good first impressions count, but all I could give her was my name because I'm too tounge-tied for words, and then she logged out of Myspace. So, before she logs back on, I would like to be prepared for pretty much anything especially the dreaded introduction. Any suggestions?

20090223010553AAh9uIz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be jealous or should i just trust her?	My girlfriend for 6 years enjoys hanging out with her long time crush. He's a younger brother of her best friend. They're at the same age ( with the guy, 21 and i'm 23)   She'd hang out with the guy's family and they call her family. So, my girl feels happy about this. And she calls her crush's brother "bro", cousins "cous", mommy "mom". I did tell her what I feel but she'd argue with me that she ain't doing wrong. I took her words. But until now she still feels like a member of family. She just doesn't care about my feelings.
20090223010620AAKqXR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She says one one ever told her they loved her.?	History:   I have taken out a girl for a month. 5 dates in total.   We kissed, I was dazzling in the high wine of new love.   We had one encounter where it became very hot and, per my book, I was gaining the relationship I always wanted.      Though we had a good talk afterwards. Told me I was a good guy, that I deserved the best. That she was not interested in a romantic relationship with me. She said she's be very willing to be friends and hangout as friends and continue the dinners we were having.      I later that night told her I loved her over the internet. More to get the withold off my heart and give her the best than an attempt to win her heart. But there was a dreg of "heart winning" in mind.      She replied that "Not many people have said that to me before and mean it".      I replied that I was honoured I was part of the few that did.      From the standpoint of a woman, should that be a Q that I should pick up and gain some hope in creating a great relationship or should I just back out completely and find other fish in the sea?      I really like that girl. I feel like I found what I was looking for... you know... just... wow...      I wonder if there's just something I can do about it.

20090223012557AATtLIS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've been having soo many problems in my life!?	My 2 best friends- one of them doesn't go to my school so i don't talk to her that much.   The best friend that goes to my school: she ditches me for this mean girl that's mean to her too and when they aren't together, we have so much fun and she always tells me how much she misses it. I don't sit with her at lunch though, I sit with 2 good friends and a bunch of guys and I like it. I just get made fun of alot, everything I do the guys critize me and I'm getting tired of it.      Boys: Don't really like anybody. They keep asking me who I like, then I say nobody then they say something like "Why are you so mean?" and I just want them to stop bothering me. But I just can't stick up for myself. I've been trying to change to a nicer person but my peers keep getting meaner and meaner to me and I just can't manage to be nice anymore.       Family: My brother has always been mean to me, but that's just how brothers are. He puts his hand down his pants and slaps me for absolutely no reason, right after I get out of the shower. He does many other things to me like "DDT" or Teabags me... :(    My mom: She decides to ignore me everytime I talk. She doesn't talk at all. She just yells. She takes all her anger out on me and I can't do anything to calm her down because she won't listen and it's just so frustrating for me.    My dad: My parents are divorced and my dad often comes in town to see us play sports. He isn't a problem or anything. So i'm deciding to not write much about him.      That's pretty much it, for at least that I can think of right now.   What should I do about my friends, peers, and family?   If you have any further questions, please ask me.

The housemate knew the situation and the both parties involved but still got involved with the guy. he denied it although she saw them kiss. Now the baby is born he has confessed they will be together. she got upset and said she dosn't want him to see the baby as she feels he betrayed her.

20090223014549AATwMI3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't my boyfriend put much effort into our relationship?	I have been with my boyfriend for about a year and we have had some rough times but, I really feel like we love each other. The problem is, I feel like relationships take a lot of work but, he doesn't really do any of the work. I am the one always driving to him and spending the night at his house. I cook for him, clean, send sweet text messages, listen to him when he needs a friend, doing favors for him etc.. He really doesn't do much, he never gets me gifts or cards for Valentine's, Christmas, my birthday, he has never once given me a flower or brought me medicine when I am sick like I do with him. He doesn't go out of his way for me never opens doors, listens to me when I am upset, he tells me he loves me very much but he gets angry with me a lot. He says it's my fault that he is mean to me.. I'm just at the end of my rope. I love him with everything I am and don't want to lose him but, when I try to talk to him about it, it turns into a fight, he's impossible to communicate with. How can I get him to show me he loves me or put effort into our relationship if he refuses to even talk about it?

20090223022139AARJmR7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why has my boyfriend gone off sex?	My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and we've been living together for four months. However since we moved in our sex life has gone completely flat. I'm fed up of initiating sex as he never does, and when I hint for him to initiate it he doesn't which makes me feel rejected. I've tried talking to him about it, but he shrugs it off and claims that its because he's just tired. It upsets me that he doesn't seem bothered about trying to fix the problem and he doesn't take it seriously. I'm sick of feeling rejected, and questioning whether its my fault he doesn't want sex. I'm only 22 and am quite attractive- surely we should be having regular sex at our age??    I'm conscious of nagging him about the problem, but really don't know how to tackle the issue with him so he can understand how unhappy its making me. I would really like some advice if anyone has been in a similar situation please!

We love each other dearly but it seems when it comes to sex (in conversation) I feel like I hit a wall. I wanted to be open in terms of freely express. I've told her fantasies I have had and she says she has never had any. This really bothers me.      Doesn't all women have fantasies in a sexual level? Am I thinking to much on this?
20090223022654AAYDCd3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys if this were you, what would you think...Please help?	I'm sorry this is long, bare with me.   I've liked this guy for a while, but I barely get to see him.  I really don't know him that well and we've never spoken, maybe once, but it was completely random and unforgettable.  But we do know each other, we went to school together and knew about the other through a friend.  The other day my friend told me a funny/cute story about him, and I thought this would be a good way to start a conversation with him and see what happens.  But since I don't see him I thought I'd add him on myspace and then send him a message.  But do you think that's weird, cause I don't know if I know him well enough to add him and then send him a message that he may take the wrong way?  Also, is that too aggressive?  It just seems so random, and I'm not sure how he would respond to it.  We've seen each other a few times over the past few weeks and it always felt like he wasn't seeing me, but through me.  And I wanted something to happen and I was going to try to talk to him, but the opportunity never really presented itself and my nerves got the better of me.  Please help me, I'm obviously desperate.   Oh, and I can't tell my friend I actually like him there's an awkwardness there that's complicated.

I was feeling the same way and we agreed to make a first date.  The night before the date was to take place he went out with mates, which I had no objection to, said he'd call when he got in.  3am in the morning he hadn't called so i phoned him.  the phone was switched off.  i had been drinking pretty heavily myself and left an insecure stupid message.  he text me back when he did eventually get home, and after listening to my mssage cancelled the date. have tried phoning to apologise and try to talk and explain but he wont answer, he replied by text saying he was no longer interested and wont reply to any further text's i send.  If I could turn turn the clock back and retract the message I sent I would.

20090223043411AAm3cqW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What on Earth can she say to him to sort this old pickle out?	My friend got a boyfriend a while ago, but she doesn't like his style. He's quite clingy and never says much to her apart from the fact he would die for her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He text her the other day saying he had a confession to make...   That he has quite severe bipolar...   She wants to stop him being so very clingy and... well... annoying... but she now feels like he has made her feel guilty and she's too nice a person to just tell him to shut up. What can she do without hurting his feelings, because bipolar is a seriously horrible thing? (I should know).
20090223043421AA2ELM0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still care or am I looking for something that isn't there?	So here's another question about my ex who left me 17 days ago. Right after the break up there were a lot of arguments because I wanted to know why he didn't love me anymore. That was his reason for leaving me.      Anyway, now we talk online almost everyday and we get on really well. Two days ago we used our webcams to see each other, though everytime I asked before this he said he wasn't ready to see me. He's also started calling me beautiful again, saying he misses me and he admitted that he's cried because he let me go and let his feelings change. It seems to me that he's having second thoughts.      We talked last night and I said the only thing standing in our way was his feelings. He then said that even if he still felt the same my family wouldn't accept him for hurting me. Thing is, my family only want what's best for me and they know how happy I was with him, so they would accept him back. I told him this and he didn't reply. He simply said he had to go to bed and signed off.      What does this mean? Are there still feelings there? When I ask he says no, but he's acting almost the way he did just before he asked me out. Help? =/

I understand that he is busy. but i really felt sad when he didn't reply my texts ): people what do you think i should do? just forget him or keeps text-ing him where he only replies just once or none? the point is when he is free or something he don't even bother text-ing me. I felt so stupid as in like i am bothering him. i asked him once before he just said nope. I wonder what he is thinking ): i will still think of him whenever i go and this made me very emo. Sometimes i tried to ignore but i just can't.      i need help, not scoldings, bad or whatever.    Thanks .

20090223044936AAJgcN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i reconsider breaking up if my super conservative family found out that i still have a boyfriend?	Here's the story. Feb. 12 my parents talked to me, they want me to break up with him. And so, they knew that we broke up, but we didn't. Today, we met up in some place near our house. My aunt saw us. She talked to me and him. She was very furious. When I got home, my mother scolded me, and wants me to choose between him and studying. Of course, I still want him, but I want to be successful too.  I'm freaking out. I love him so much. People may not believe me because I'm only 14 turning 15 but then, this is what I feel. I'm really sure that I'm not infatuated with this guy. But then, how could I go on?! How?! Should I reconsider breaking up?! I don't want to do so, please I really need advices. Thanks.
20090223044937AAHGvN2	Family & Relationships;Friends	This is confusing to me...?	I still have this girl who considers me as a friend. She knows I want more from her than that, but she says she doesn't have feelings for me. Yet we fight a lot and then she gets really angry at me and says she doesn't want to see me again. Yet, when I tell her that she will never see me again, she just laughs and kicks my *ss and is nice for a while to me. Also, she claims she never listens to anybody, yet when I give her an advice to do something or do it in a certain way, she always does it promptly that way. When I don't call or txt her for a few days, she's there on the phone or txting me if there is something wrong with me. I don't know. It is confusing for me: does she have feelings for me, despite she says she don't?
20090223074939AAJ1OtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think my long term boyfriend and I just broke up. My heart is broken. Advice on coping? I'm 29.?	I'm 29.  He is 30.      I've been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, we live together in a condo, and have talked mildly about marriage/kids before. He said in the begin of our relationship he didn't know if he wanted that. We kept dating, and now, he is saying more firmly that he doesn't think he wants that (with me). He said it to me after having about 2 or 3 beers, so his inhibitions were lower. We talked for hours and came to the conclusion that I wanted marriage and he just doesn't know, so...its best that we break up.      We were GREAT yesterday, today we broke up.   I'm shocked and blindsided.  Came out of nowhere for me.   Yesterday, we had a date night and lots of fun.      I'm broken hearted, plus this is my HOME, where I LIVE, here, us, together...where do I go from here???
20090223072556AAltG1C	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really my "friend?" What to do about her?	So, I have this friend, her name is Claudine. Sometimes I call her "deanie" or "bean" or something, because her handwritings not very good and it usually looks like it says "bean" or "deanie" or something like that. So recently, whenever I call her that, she always threatens me, saying she's going "to hit me upside the head" or "cut off all my hair" if i call her that again.      Then, we're both in this writing competition called power of the pen (potp) and at the first tournament she won an award and i did not. i was kind of upset because i thought i did good, and she was bragging about it and stuff, then at the most recent competition, neither of us won an award and our coach said that claudine had a good chance of advancing to the next round and i didnt (i didnt do very good) and claudine kept on bragging about it.      and whenever im telling her a story, she always interrupts and corrects me, for example i was talking to her about how a gangster tried to shoot my grandpa, and she kept arguing with me saying "are u sure hes a gangster" and stuff like that, always interrupts. shes smarter than me, ill admit, and she treats me like im stupid sometimes just because im not in algebra 2.  if im wrong about one little thing, she rubs it in my face. i think she tries to impress her other friends, by making me look bad (to make her look better) in front of them, and im really hurt b/c ive known her almost my whole life. what to do?

20090223071836AAbWrsJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was this abuse?  What should I do?	I have been with my boyfriend for about 2 and a half years.  In the past, during arguments, things have gotten a little heated.  Sometimes he has shaken me or grabbed me and held onto me bringing me to the floor.  He has never hit me.  He also hits himself sometimes during arguments.  Yesterday we got into a fight and I was sitting on a chair.  He was kneeled in front of me and he grabbed me and he fell to the ground while holding on to me,  somehow i landed wrong and I broke my collar bone.  I was in alot of pain and he panicked.  I was on the ground crying and he was in the other room hitting himself, freaking out.  I couldn't believe that instead of comforting me he was still trying to make it about HIM.  He finally got it together and took me to the hospital.  He has apologized and was crying at the hospital non stop.  He says he will never lay a hand on me again.  Was this abuse?  He didn't mean to hurt me, but he did.  What do I do?

20090223070556AAAoHE6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Whats should I do about my *friends*?	Ok so i;m going to call people by the first letter in their name.   I was on the phone with *L* and we were talking about how *S* had gotten stuck up since high scool started.   Usualy *L* would agree but this time she just said, really?      And all of a sudden *S* started scremaing at me, I didn't even know she was on te line.   ANd then she hung up.   I got pissed at *L*.      Later I was talking to *H* about what had happened and then on the same line was *C* and we were all agreeing on it, exept for the fact that *C* was previolsy takling to *S* and she thought *S* had hung up, but she didn;t.      I was starting to get really mad.   After a few hours me and *S* made up, and we had some fun and we played truth or dare over the phone.   *S* made me tell her my deepest secret and I thought she use to be and  still was my BFF, but then *J*, *K*, *L* and *P* started laughing and calling me an idiot.      I hung up and someone called back and told my mum it was my friend *A* so I answered and it turned out to be *S* and she said she recorded the whole thing and she is gonna let everyone listen.      So, what should I do, the teachers at my school dont care and my parents, well, what can they do?       I have always been a loyel friend and was never mean to anyone, so how can I deal with this?      If your here to give a dumb answer dont bother.      Thanks in advance

20090222234008AA61i9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about shy girls?	If a girl is the shy/awkward type, and she dates you once, but rejects you the next time and says you two should just be friends, but stares at you every time she sees you, gets angry/hurt when you are with other girls, and tries to talk to you and get your attention- what is she trying to say?      I normally would write a girl off because this type of behavior signifies "game playing" and I'm a student working full-time and have no time to play along in these childish games. But she is shy and a bit awkward and that's why I'm asking this question. And I like her. How should I pursue this, or should I stop looking like a douche and just move on?
20090222231900AAenjSv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she's lesbian?	I met this girl who's friends with one of my friends, and I really like her. But I went on her facebook the other day, and there's a lot of stuff suggesting that she's lesbian, but I'm not sure.       There's a lot of pictures of her with this one girl, and in a couple of them they are kissing. In one, the kiss is on the lips. Also, the girl she's with a lot (maybe her gf, if she is lesbian) has a picture up of her dancing with some random other girl, and the description is "the night (name here) became lesbian". There are also some wall posts where her possible gf refers to her as lover.      What are the chances that she's really lesbian, and if she is, is there a chance that she's just bi? She seems perfect for me, and I really like her already.

20090223061606AAKFiL1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stay at home while he goes or should I go with him to court?	I am 23 and my man is 30... he has been fighting his divorce for about 2 years, because when she left she took everything and all he had was a tv that didn't work and a old mattress, and she took all his money out of their bank account.  So anyways he was trying to get her to agree on things that were his and she finally just now agreed.  They have 2 children and I am living with him, at first just to help pay bills now we have fallen in love.  We used to sleep in different rooms and now we sleep in the same bed.  So for the last year and a half it has been "Us" and I am happier than ever.  I just found out I am pregnant. Six weeks along, so nobody knows yet.  And now he has to go to court to fight over custody of his children, I am supposed to go, his lawyer told me it would be best interest if I did go for the court has already done a background check on me (needed for court giving him 50/50 joint custody).  Every other week the kids will be here. So while he is at work I will be here watching the kids.  8 year old boy and 5 year old girl. Should I go for his "wife" will be there????       And please no mean answers I am just looking for if I should go

20090222223715AAq1UB5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Telling a guy I like him...?	I told a guy I liked him --in person--(and I thought he liked me...he sent me chocolates on Valentine's Day) but he didn't give me a response. He seemed shocked and surprised, and a little uncomfortable. I told him to think about what I told him, and he said he would. He's really shy/kind of dorky and has never had a gf, and from his response, I don't think he wants one. I don't want him as a bf because we don't know each other all that well. But the way I told him made it seem like I wanted to be more than friends (I flat out said it, though I didn't really mean it...I'm not even positive I like him that way yet). The reason I told him is because I thought he felt the same way and maybe by telling him he could get the guts to ask me out! But I think I did the opposite and made it really awkward...what should I do? And what is with this guy?? We're 15.

20090223063412AAbUwsK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Picking up girls on the beach.?	Hey so I'm 17 and I know the beach is a far way off but I'm looking for tips. I am skinny with a little bit of a core but definitely not muscular at all. I'm really white (haha) but will be prob. about average by summer with a buzzcut. Ok, these really have nothing to do with my question, not exactly sure why I wrote that.   anyways...   First, how do I approach a girl on the beach that's cute if shes walking by me or just sun tanning? Second, I thought it would be fun to ask her to briefly explain her life from birth forwards. It would be something fun and different for when the convo goes sour. God/bad idea?   Also, how do I be the kind/nice/gentleman (i got that part down) but also have the flirty factor and sorta wild side that would give me the opportunity to kiss her within a few days of meeting her you know what I mean (no, im not a creeper =P)?      Thanks everyone!  Don't just say "be nice" or "be a jerk, girls love that."  Tell me HOW.      --Ryan      ps. I WILL be picking a best answer, so if you dont answer well, you're missing the boat haha.

20090223062824AA1g70h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does anyone ever feel traped in their marriage and just want to run around single for just one more night?	I adore my hubby but I just wonder what life would be like for one night or some crazy girl weekend to run around and flirt like a single gal again. Does anyone ever have those feelings, and how do you deal with them? I would never EVER step outside my marriage but the thought of it I think isn't cheating.

20090223062700AAgvNJy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Get married without her parents approval?	My girl and I love eachother and we are both 20 years old..sd have gone through quite a bit together and want to get married...both of our parents dont agree with it though because they feel she isnt ready and she's too young.. my parents dont like it either but dont feel as strong about it as hers..heres the issue: we broke up recently but still want it to work. Her parents threatened that if she wanted to be with me after that, then they will kick her out of the house. We agreed that we will give it some time and if necessary, will get married without our parents approval, which would mean that she would leave California to Arizona to be with me after we go get married...We really want this regardless of approval or not..need advice.

I know she is scared of 'losing her dad' but I really don't want that! I get on great with her 10 year old sister who is a sweetheart, but this one is a nightmare!!   She is sultry and moody and has a really mallicious and devious attitude. She sulks, won't speak to me, nods occasionally and calls me the 'cleaner'. She slags me fit to burn to my partner, and to her mother, and to her sister who tells me. She is just so rude but can have such a sweet attitude when she wants. I know her mother isnt keen on me and that influences her greatly because she loves her mum, but her attitude stinks!! I suggested a girly day out but she said no way. I try to talk, I get ignored. I talk to my partner, he stands my corner but lets her get away with the attitude when it comes down to it, I am always pleasant with her and have never shouted at her at all in any way and never would because thats not my job. I try to do nice things and have bought her things. No gratitide or anything, I am at the end of my tether with this girl!! Somebody - help!!!

20090223051009AAR5miM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would you think it was strange?	So I'm really picky about where I want to have our wedding reception.. all of the places around where I live are just stupid.. lol      the only place I've found is 4 hours away and since some of my family members are lower income they wouldn't be able to make it! So that's out of the question!    The other place however is great.. it has a huge patio for cocktail hour, a large room for the reception dinner!!! and it's in such a great neighbor hood, and it's BEAUTIFUL.. it has everything that I'm looking for...      So we were able to budget so that we could have steak dinner as an option as well as chicken and a vegetarian option! We were going to also do lots of cute fancy hor d'oeuvres and we planned for it to be a formal event anyways!      So here's the problem.. the place is a community center... like on the other side of the building there's a workout room heated pool and basketball gym.. but you can't hear any noise or anything like that!!! It's not like a ghetto community center it's in a nice neighborhood anyways my question is      would you think it's strange to go to a formal wedding reception and have a fancy dinner.. at a community center?!?!?

I am a full-time electrical engineering student and my wife is a mechanical engineer for a large firm. My wife does not want me to work because she wants me to finish school quickly. This weekend my wife and I went over our expenses in Excel. In the end, we found he are about -$600 in the hole every month. We are living at the minimum right now at we can barely afford groceries. Daily, we scrap together money just to buy a couple of items at the grocery store. I told my wife I'm getting a job but my wife thinks I'll drop out of school if I do.

20090223061903AAGvcID	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does anyone have this issue with the Husband/wife and their cell phone?	My husband HAS to answer his cell phone whenever it rings and he HAS to check his voicemail as soon as it beeps.  I don't really care except when we are in the middle of something really important.  We had an eye appointment on Saturday for all of us.  We get there and the server is down so they cannot pull up our insurance and the chaos begins...  My husband and his daughter go first while I try and figure out what to do with the insurance.  While Im getting my eyes checked they are out picking out their glasses..I come out and try to explain the insurance situation and his phone starts ringing off the hook..he talks to his Mom for a good 10 minutes..hangs up. His brother the same deal..finally hangs up with him.  He then informs me that the glasses for everyone is going to be $1200 and hands the lady his card...his Mom is ringing him again while I am in the middle of explaining that it doesn't sound right we have insurance to cover glasses..he jumps up and goes outside and talks to her for another 20 minutes.  (We are about to meet up with them for lunch so I'm VERY pissed off right now)  I have no problem sending someone to voicemail or telling them I'm busy and I'll call back when I can...HE can not.  So now I'm left to figure things out and get his card back before they charge it up-it's crowded as hell-we do not have $1200 to spend on glasses anyways!  Turns out the eye doctor accepts our insurance but the eyeglass place does not.  Seems extremely stupid to me so I grab our paperwork and perscriptions and motion him to come out to the car.  I am not going to pay for glasses when we have insurance for it!!  He finally gets off the phone and I am trying to explain why we have to go somewhere else to get the glasses and there goes hsi phone again..someone left him a voicemail. He starts driving off and I can't find his paperwork.  He can't answer me b/c he's to busy listening to his brothers voicemail!!  Steam is coming out of my ears at this point and I have to go back into the store and grab his paperwork he left on some random table b/c he was too busy chatting away on the phone.  This is the same guy that just lectured his daughter that he is sick and tired of her being on the phone 24/7!!  With the steam coming out of my ears I tell him how rude and disrespectful it is and I do not do this to him with my phone.  He replys that he was not rude and I should have come out and got him before I made any decisions and left so therefore *I* am the rude one.  So I am supposed to put everyone on hold go outside and get you when you know we are in the middle of something?!  I don't think so!  I told him the next time I will grab his phone and break it in half and I made it clear I was NOT joking about that either.  Does anyone else have this problem and how did they deal with it? Any success??
20090223071805AAYykg8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Any ideas for starting new wedding reception traditions?	We are skipping bouquet toss because my career-driven friends have threatened to run screaming in the other direction. We are skipping garter toss because, I don't care how old the tradition is, it is inappropriate to reach up a dress in front of family during a serious occasion. We are skipping cutting of the cake because I really wanted a sundae bar instead. Etc... After cutting a lot of stuff out, I would really like to start some new unique reception traditions, but I'm pretty stumped for ideas. The wedding is informal and this June. We are age 25-26, our guest list is around 40 people.

20090223072224AA4FAcY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What do you think about an engagement ring with Amethyst as it's center stone?	I love ruby and amethyst. But I already have a number of jewelry  - some of them gifts from my family w/ rubies and also ruby ring that I'm wearing w/c were inherited from my mom,  (my birthstone is ruby) And I'm not a big fan of diamonds either so I'm thinking about an amethyst center stone just like this for an engagement ring  -->       http://www.tiffany.com/Shopping/item.asp...       I know it looks more of like a cocktail ring but I really like it. Do you think it looks cheap? What would you think if a guy bought this as an engagement ring, would you think he's a cheapskate? Or a woman likes this as an engagement ring, has a lack of taste?            I'm not just talking about that particular Tiffany Amethyst ring but an amethyst center stone in general.      The reason I'm asking this is my man comes from a very traditional family and well - this is not exactly traditional. They might think he's being a cheapskate or they might think I lack sense.
20090223075246AAwq6Tq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I over reacting to this situation?	My cousin and I used to be very close growing up. We are in our 20's now, and are the same age. We were the same major in college, and we think and act alike, and have the same talents. We even look a lot alike, except I am a guy shes a girl. We both have jobs. Ever since she got her job she has had a large social life because she works with a lot of young people. I do not, so I don't go out nearly as much as her. A lot of people like her because she is fun, outgoing and very attractive. I am attractive too, but I am more shy and have had a harder time fitting in with people growing up because I am an old soul, and used to be piked on and such. But she really is one of the few people who understands me and sees life in the same  ways that I do. I admire her.       So I asked her online what she was doing on Sat. and she said she was going to a party, so I just told her that sounds fun I hope you have a good time. She only responded with, "well im going to go take a shower now." No thank you, goodbye, etc. So I feel it was inconsiderate because I would have asked her to go with me had the tables been turned, and I left her a message telling her that, to which I recieved no response. To her she thinks its annoying that I even care, but she doesnt realize she has hurt me by not  wanting me to be a part of her social life. This isn't the first time either, this has been going on for years. Do you understand why I would feel upset? It's hard watching someone you know more than so many other people have all these new people in her life that she would rather be around than me.

My boyfriend has this issue where he thinks that he can't say that he is making something out of himself until he makes a lot of money and is doing a job that he loves. I asked him if he ever thought about looking inside himself and base his value on his strengths, qualities, and past achievements and he said he doesn't think like that. Is this just a guy thing or is he a downer? I think that a persons value is based on who they are deep down inside not on money or having the latest things, etc. He feels like he is nothing until his goals are accomplished. I need a guys opinion on this.

My gf and I have been going out for more than two years, we recently got back after a two week split and everything is going good now...   I am about to finish my master degree and she will finish her bachelors...we met in college and we both love each other and could possibly get married..   The thing is I am contemplating going back to my country to start a business and would like to maybe bring her   we have joked about her coming to live with me in my country and she said she would, she loves it(I brought her there last year and she didn't want to leave). Although here in America things aren't that bad,I have a job, two houses(paid for), car etc....and everything I would need...but in order to expand my business ventures I would need to go to my home country(its in the Caribbean)..but maybe also live both here and there is also a possibility..We both love to travel so this is a plus..   She is still considering what she wants to do with her life, while i might have to start running my fathers business in my home country and try to start my own business..   I know she said she would come but am I asking too much of her..?

20090222233956AAoCDsK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it really my fault or my boyfriend's 10 POINTS BEST ANSWER?	We now live together and we were watching t.v on the couch. He was getting in a bad mood. My favorite show was coming on so I cozied up some more and asked him if I could lay on his shoulder he said firmly NO like he wanted me to back off so I did. I backed all the way to the end of the couch and enjoyed the show but ignored him & laughed at the show enjoyed it then 20 minutes into the program he just got up and walked away and I was like whatever, I'm gonna enjoy my evening so I watched another film when the show was over while he sulked in frustration. An hour later he comes back and climbs on top of me and says he's sorry. I don't show him any affection back, I just look at him in the eyes and ask him why it was necessary for him to do that and if he could explain and he ask if I could just forget about it and that he is really sorry. I told him that what he did kinda hurt me. He sat with me for another 20 minutes and we just relaxed. Then he starts making remarks (jokingly he thinks) about races and saying how he thinks I wish he were my race and I look at him like what?? and he just gets insecure and says he gonna go to bed and that one day I'll find the love of my life because it's not him (according to him) Earlier I had a long talk with him about why he had been acting odd lately and I asked him if it was because he wanted to break up with me or if he was getting tired of me etc. He said it definitely was not, and that he is still very much attracted to me still and that he loves me and living with me. He asked if I am tired of him, I say no that I love him and love being his girlfriend. Now we are going to bed angry. I'm just getting tired of this, does he want me to break up with him, I've done it before, like 7 times and I even offered to get my stuff and leave but he appears to want me to stay. I just don't understand what on earth is going on with him? He makes me look like a bad guy, gets mad at me or says stuff that is offensive and I'm tired of it. I always go back and tell him I'm sorry for something he did and take the heat and make up with him, I need a break.

Do you automatically disqualify a girl if your aware that she's had sex with your friend (say they were friends w/ benifits or dated briefly)? I know most girls are horrified by the idea of being with a guy who's had sex with one of their friends (i know i am). I was just wondering if it was the same for guys. I'm sure it varies to some degree but what are your feelings?
20090222233955AAEZFGv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...which body part do you like the best?	OK guys, just curious how my fellow brothers feel. I am personally attracted to breasts first, stomach second, and posterior third.       What are you most attracted to? Breasts, Midriff, Rear-end, Legs, Hips, Lips, Hair, Face, etc?       And in what order?
20090222220734AAOqGir	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me? (short)?	i'll try to make it short. we had this thing last year, nothing official at all. we just talked and flirted every moment we saw eachother. nothing came of it and then summer break came, so we didnt see eachother at all during that time (due to the fact we were in different countries pretty much the entire time).      its started up again, a bit. he goes out of his way to talk to me, even if its about dumb stuff. we joke around, pretending to be really mean to eachother, but dont mean any of it.      i really really like him, and am wondering if he likes me too.    or is it just in my head?

Okay so i went out with my friends, my guy, and his friends to the movies and after my friends left one guy asked if his friend could have my friends number and i kept saying no and so he offered to do push ups and i didn't believe he could so i said if he did so many i would. Then he did that amount and i said okay i will ask but she said no so i said i couldnt. Would my bf think bad of me for this? Or what about his guys?

20090223074802AAneL1e	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help with a mean sicko at my school. PLEASE HELP!?	So I got in a huge fight with a girl in my p.e. class over a little thing and I wanted to know your opinion if shes right or I'm right or what. Heres the conversation.      Me-Do you like josh   Her-No where did you hear that   Me-A girl in one of my classes she said her boyfriend told her   Her-What! Who the f*** told yo that   Me-a girl in one of my classes   Her-Who!   Me-I'd rather not say I dont wanna get anyone in trubble I just wanted to warn you so you could stop the rumor   Her-What the f*** you f****** b**** who the hell told you this   Me- Im not going to tell u  just wanted to warn you    So I left it at that but she kept telling people that I'm a b****   The next day she it went like this.      Her-ok so who told you   Me-you know i dont wanna say and i asked her and she told me she doesnt want me to tell you. I just want this whole thing to be over   Her-so if you want it to be over tell me the girls name   Me-Well so i can not tell you   Her-She wont know if you tell me i wont say anything i wont confront her or anything.   Me-It doesnt matter I would be a dishonest friend then   Her-she wont know it doesnt matter   Me-why do you want to know if the rumor is already over and noone got hurt why do you wanna hurt someone   Her-Im not going to hurt anyone just tell me her name she wont know   Me-it doesnt atter if she knows or doesnt know i wouldnt be a trustworthy friend to her then   Her-well your not being a true friend to me then if you were my true riend yu would tell me then   Me-well then oh well   Her-What ypu dont want to be MY friend anymore   Me-guess not   Her-well then screw you........oh and i would want to be friends with an f******  b**** like you   Me-Ya know what i really dont care       And hen she looked all shocked and everything, this girl thinks highley of herself. I dont want to be her friend so i dont want any advise about that. I just want to know if I'm doing the wrong thing by not telling her the girl's name. The reason I dont want to tell her is because if she nw who it was she would beat the crap out of her and then i would be untrustworthy, I just wanted to warn her if i new it would escalate to this level i would have never said anything. Sorry this is so long thanks!      P.S. Im switching out of her class but I will still be with her for a few more days and we were never friends just aquaintences.

20090223063408AA5JidY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I answer this guy?	I went out with this guy for 3 times and last sat we went out again to a night club, then we got intimate kisses and touches but we didn't have sex. he then wrote me a mail that " it seems like we jumped into it a bit fast, it must have been the energetic music + alcohol and he suggests us taking our time and getting to know each other". Well, I liked this guy and thought he could be the right person, but I kinda feel awkward that he would say this, how should I answer him and what should I do with him?
20090223075404AAT3WDO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can anyone help us find a place to celebrate our renewal of vows?	My husband and I will be celebrating 8 years of marriage next month. We are going to have a renewal of vows for our 10th wedding anniversary. But we don't know where to go to have the celebration. There won't be any family or friends invited. Just me, him, and our son. Here are the places we've thought of going:    1: Vegas-Elvis Impersonator   2: Vegas-Christian Church   3: Florida-Sandals Resort   4: New Jersey-Atlantic City      The only thing about the celebration is that we can't fly anywhere. I have a medical condition that prevents me from flying. So I have to drive (which we don't mind). But the place has to be in the continental US.       I would appreciate any help. Thanks. :)

20090223073506AABOYFG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do? 10 points!!!?	okay i've been dating my bf for 5 months now. and i almost broke up with him yesterday when i found out he was dealing drugs. but i ended up staying with him. but i would like to take a break until he is completely done with that stuff. i mean, wat else could he be lying to me about ya know? i love him and he loves me, and i dont ya know want to be with anyone else. but i dont want him to be mad at me when i tell him i think we should take a break. cuz he said most ppl break up after that. but if its true love like he says then it wont be that way right? like, i want us to be together but not tied down so if he does this stuff again i dont want to be involved. but i wont be his official gf until he's done with it all. so how do i say it without him getting upset at me? wat do i say to assure him i'm all his? and wat do i do if he goes and has sex and stuff with other girls after i tell him this? i'm so confused wat should i do? =/
20090223074027AAXebFO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a form of abuse?	My husband has a very low sex drive and it has caused so many unresolved rows between us.  My arguement is that if he is always tired from work then I understand however I have also explained how rejected it makes me feel, unattractive and unloved.  I have asked him to at least consider paying me compliments or giving me a hug instead, that way I dont feel so low.      He still does nothing.  He has even excused his behaviour by saying the problem is "it takes two to tango".      I cannot bring myself to make the first move again as I feel so rejected by him for years and years so we live in this stalemate situation      His previous girlfriend called him boring and cheated on him twice and he still took her back - I wonder if this was the same for them      I want to reject him the way he has rejected me so I dont cuddle or kiss him either and I dont initiate sex - we now have a platonic relationship but Im not sure I can live like this anymore      what do I do?

20090222221056AA6WDbN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who is at fault? (CORRECTED)?	I posted this already but people didn't get what I was saying...so let me clarify...      My pseudo-boyfriend and I have been keeping in touch for about 7 months now...since he is 700 miles away...we're waiting for may when we will be back together (exciting!)      Yesterday, we had found something about our summer job so he wanted me to three-way our one co-worker...but I had a hard time getting them both on the phone at the same time (one would answer, the other wouldn't, one would say "call me back" and then I would and they wouldnt' answer)...we probably MUTUALLY called each other about 7 times each...trying to get it worked out...      so today I wanted to tell him something about my sister's wedding (he's going to me with) so just decided I would shot him a quick email and started it with    "I feel like I called you enough yesterday for a lifetime..."    and then wrote the information.      All I got back was "ur right...therefore no need to call no more"      I initially got kinda mad and wrote "it was your fault I had to call so much...quit being an ***"...(because it was..he'd even admit that)      he didn't reply...so I thought he was being serious...      so I sent him another text asking what was going on...   no reply.       called him..no reply      finally sent him a text saying "_____ I really need to know what is going on her...that sounded kind of rude"    (and this was over a 10-hour time frame...I wasn't repeatedly texting him).      I finally got messaged back that he was kidding and that I need to calm down...      how the H was I suppossed to know that was a joke? there was no "haha" or  "....joking" or even anything else (if he would've said something else...like about the wedding information I would've maybe gotten the joke a little better)...      who is at fault?

He's younger than me by two years [and he acts really mature for his age] but when he found out i was almost 16 his eyes got big, he half laughed then he looked down really quickly..   When he's talking to me his eyes stare in mine like..no one i've ever talked to before..   He's kinda shy, until you get him talking...   I met him about two or three months ago..   And he cut himself on accident, recently, and he kept coming up to me showing me the progress of his finger, if it was still bleeding..   and then i decided to pick on him by saying "You think there's gunna be a scar?" and he started laughing and said "I think i'll get a scar." and while we were talking his dad turned around, looked at his son and i, shook his head and started laughing.   Also, i had my teeth cut out before one of our 'big games' and he was making sure i was well enough to play the bb game. It was really sweet,..   and when i'm talking to him or next to him, one of his friends will come up and embarass him. [like smacking him in the butt. saying "wooooo [then his name] ....etc etc] then he'll look at me and his face gets really red...   Recently one of my friends was sitting next to me, she left and went to the bathroom..and he was sitting behind us, then he looks at me and says "I might steal her seat" like 5 minutes after she left, and he sat there..and One time i smiled at him and said hi [just being friendly, i do that to everyone] and he smiled really big and looked down..    Also, i DO NOT like him in that way, although, he is kinda cute..but thats besides the point.....i'm just wondering if he likes me.   soo, what do ya'll think?
20090222222840AAkyAoq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do people think about meeting singles online?	I met my boyfriend on myspace and when I was thinking about first catching up with him I found that many people were against the idea of meeting people online? Why is this?    I understand that you could be talking to just anyone, but if they had enough proof that they are a real person and you meet under safe circumstances then what is the problem with it?      I think it is a great way to meet people outside of your area of group of friends. But people seem to think that everyone online is a psycho. Even though they themselves are online.      What do people think about it? Are you for or against meeting singles online?

20090223060457AApsLHD	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend won't open up to me?	well she's really depressed, and goes to see a counsellor. she doesn't exactly have an eating disorder, but she doesn't eat nearly as much as she should, and she thinks she's ugly which i just can't comprehend as she's actually gorgeous and has a million boys falling for her like flies. she has loads of guys that are in love with her and text her all the time, and she's showed me these texts and they talk to her about how she feels and about stuff with her counsellor that she never talks to me about, though i do ask her. it's just that she doesn't tell me stuff. she knows me inside and out cause i tell her everything, but i don't know her that well, and i can't even get through to her, and it kinda makes me feel quite ****. i just feel like she doesn't really care about me, and i love her like crazy, and i just feel like i'm pushing myself on her, and trying to pull her to me and she just doesn't want to know, though she says i'm one of the most important people in her life...yeah. she says she really cares about all those guys that hound her and depend on her with their problems and tell her about how they self harm all the time and are just attention seeking twats that stress her out and won't leave her alone, and she's too nice to tell them to get a grip. this is long and boring and probs no one will answer it, but if you do i'd really appreciate it, even to tell me i'm a pathetic twat. cheers xXx
20090223050513AAJ2dOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal? Who else is like this? I'm really curious...?	I haven't been attracted (looks wise) to any guys i've dated, i've found who they are & their personality far more sexy. Im 20 turning 21 this year & I get told i'm really good looking (I'M NOT TRYING TO BE COCKY) But I find a guys personality far more attractive then what he looks like. I don't understand why people go for looks. I find it sexy if a guy is smart & interesting. I feel really old fashioned. I wont have sex until I get married. I don't feel comfortable getting all mushy in public. Is there any other people out there like me? Or am I the only one?
20090223054730AAWyXIE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A question for girls only please..(no peeking guys.. you won't like it)?	How can i get my man to turn into a yes man?   he never does anything that i want him too, he's not lazy or anything, he does do his fare share with baby and house work cleaning cooking and stuff, can be very romantic sometimes,is a great lover in bed, problem is he won't ever listen to what i want him to do, when i ask him why can't you be a yes man and just agree and admit that i always know best, he replied, you might think you want me to be like that, but the fact is if i was, then we would not be together you would have dumped me ages ago, do you think this is true.   any ideas on helping me to bring him round to my way of thinking.   i want to dominate him for a change, i want to wear the trousers for a while.   is this wrong or too much for me to ask, just to hold the remote control for a while would be bliss.

20090223052122AAnf82i	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	In the modern world, besides sex, what is the point of being in a relationship?	So besides our sexual desires and the apparent need for humans to continue reproducing, what is the point of people being in relationships...       If anything, relationships tend to hold people back... we no longer live in a society where we actually need each other anymore... The more I grow, the more I see that being in a relationship is just further complication to one's life... I have actually gotten to the point where I'm not even interested in meeting anybody... and even when the opportunity arises, I just ignore it... kind of like procrastinating something...      I fail to see the significance of emotional attachment to someone whom you are not related to... in today's world... everyone has their own thing going... you need to be able to move around and do things without worrying about anybody else...       Ok... yes... there is settling down... but getting to that point seems to be the end of one's practical life... sort of like salmon when they venture back upstream to mate and die... and the various assortment of creatures that mate and then die...

20090223060558AApEArI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If you were this girl's mother, what would you do?	I asked this question the other day, but didn't get to many responses, anyway i am asking again. I broke up with this guy because i found porn on my computer that he was looking at, now i have no problem with men looking at porn, they all do it. anyway this porn was questionable. the website had a disclaimer stating that all models were 18 years of age or older, and whether they are or not, they looked like they were 11, 12, 13 years old. you can tell which ones he was looking at because they words under them were purple instead of blue, anyway he looks at the ones that look the youngest. now, he moved in with his ex-wife, they have a little girl who is about 6-7 years old, the ex found the same thing on her computer, and blocked the sites, not because she was concerned about the age of the girls, but because she doesn't want him looking at any porn. if i was her i wouldn't let him around the little girl, his daughter i know, but still, he obviously has a taste for very young looking girls so why take the chance. anyway my questions are, do you think this makes him a pedophile, and would you allow access to you daughter? (even if it is his daughter too)
20090223060559AA46DZK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex wife and ex mother-n- law are trying to stop me from being part of my child's life?	My ex wife and I have a court ordered visitation agreement in place already and my child support payments are now being garnish from my pay check each month. From the begining, I was the one who went to put child support on my self so I could be part of my sons life. While in court, my ex wife had told  a lot of lies about me and the relationship. At that time my son was 4 years old and it had been almost two years since I last saw  him. My ex wife and mother 'n' law convinced the Judge that I never paid child support, that I beat my son every time he would cry, put a gun to my ex wife head and pulled the trigger, broke into her mother's home where she, her mother and my son lived and beat my ex wife and her mother up, that I was a drug dealer and a user. After all that, I got a lawyer. We were in and out of the courts for about two years and I cleared my name, I got my visitations, I was able to finially get my divorce finalize and the Judge ordered joint custody. I've been lied on, been through supervised vistitions, back ground checks, accuse of asexually touching, abundantment, abuseing my son, etc.      I don't have extra monies now! to hire a attorney again or I would. I'm a good father and I love my son , all I want is to have the oppertunity to be part of his growing up, (he will be 9 years old this year) assist with raiseing and molding my boy into a good man and most importantly, getting him prepare for life.      I was starting  to move on with my life and put all this behind me. After all this my ex wife and ex mother 'n' law got a new cell number so I can not contact them, they have packed up and moved to Whilly Texas. I've called the courts they don't care, I've called the state, I believe the courts are set up to believe that all men are no good, dead beat dads especially the black man! they did nothing, so I track them down myself and for what, I've sent numerous letters to the courts, I've sent letters to my ex wife and ex mother 'n' laws new address,  I've also sent letters to ex wifes work place and nothing... What can I do? What organizations can handle this matter? Can anybody help me?      Thanks,      Art

20090223063053AAeAlXD	Family & Relationships;Family	My stepmum is evil and my dad is blind?	I have lost all hope...      i lost hope in making peace with my family   my stepmum is evil   my dad is blind..      im actually more dissapointed with my dad... his really blind... +___+   my situation is...      my birth mother passed away when i was young. and dad was arranged to marry my stepmum. I was happy for them and was happy to have half brothers.   but living with my stepmum the past few yrs, shes moody and has double standards.   Becoz she has double standards with me and her kids.   I also have double standards with her kids and my blood brother.      when she notice this behavior (that im nicer to my blood bro) she goes all frantic.    and yells at my dad for not teaching me better       she thinks that i moved in with her family.. she once asked me " would u take in somebody elses kids" and i said to her " no, why would i ,, i dun even want kids' i think she took it literally   (she reckons i moved in with her family.. so im suppose to suck up to her for her approval and affection)      anyways i think if you marry the husband , then you marry the kids also. i see so many other stepmums out there really being fair with their kids and their husbands kids. that is all i ask her.. like.. be fair..       she keeps sayin to me.. i am suppose to love all my bros since they are my dads kids also.   but shes got double standards.. only i have to do the dishes.. her kids neva.   when she makes dinner.. she only eva calls her own kids to eat first.. i only eva eat after everyone has eaten.      once i soaked a coffee cup coz it was stuck and would only come out if i didnt soaked it b4 i cleaned it. I left it at the kitchen window near the sink.( where it was away form all the other piles of the dirty dishes) that day i was mad with her.. so i skipped dinner.. knowing she would have to do the dishes instead. (i deliberately moved it far away so she didnt have to clean it)   she goes ' even her own cup she cant even clean. and rar rar rar" all frantic about it.. she cleans it and complains.. then i said ' if u didnt wanna clean it u dun have to' then she lost it and when all crazy the house turned upside down.      i dunnoe.. she has double stanards... so when i have double standards shes all nuts..   everythink is about her kids. its all she cares about..

20090223065727AAEDr7y	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do when your friends betray you by stealing from you?	ok, so im 23, have known these 2 friends for over 10 years.  On saturday i was at one of their houses with the other.  I had ￡40 in my bag which has gone missing.  I havent directly accused either but have made it clear that it has gone missing and asked both of them to check in case they maybe found it and picked it up by mistake.  Both said they havent.  There is no way it could have fallen out as it was in a zipped part.  I now dont know what to do as i feel i have been betrayed.  I dont care about the money anymore, but i feel that i cant trust either which obviously isnt fair on the other.  But as i dont know who it was, i now have bad feelings for both of them.  Im not really too sure what i can do now.  Sure, i can forget about it, but there is still that fact that someone has stolen from me.

We both couldn't/can't believe how well we just get along and how much we have in common. Yes he's 18 and I'm 34. He has been through alot and does not act like he's 18. I don't look 34, I look alot younger. Question...it can't be wrong. He already told his mom about me. It feels soo right. I haven't been happy like this in a long time. He feels the same. We just both didn't expect it to go so well. And believe me, I've been on a few dates in the recent months....this was soooo different. OPINIONS? I already know that it's just a number. And if you were to see us in a picture, you would not believe I'm a year shy from being twice his age..thanks everyone.

She is about 10 years old than me (I am 23) and has a real job (I am a student). I can't afford to pay for dinner and she knows this (I am really broke).

20090223071537AAswWzk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he ignoring me?	I’ve been w my bf for a long time about 4 yrs. We’re both in our mid-20’s. Long distance, he left me about 3 times and I always seem to take him back. This time we got into a problem about something really STUPID, a picture of him and a girl and he also saw a pix with me and a guy. We both know we’re just friends like he is with that other girl. We started yelling at each other over the phone but before that, I had left a vm saying to leave me alone and what not. He sent me a bad insult email. I didn’t reply, next day he sent me a “sorry” email saying that “I left him”. Which is not true and that I was NEVER going to hear from him again. After that incident, I’ve sent him a couple of really nice emails saying sorry, tx msgs and a vm. He hasn’t responded to none! (its been about 4 days) I HATE being ignored. I’m guilty as much as he is. What should I do????????

20090223073641AAuUyQb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will this union work out?	There is a woman who dumps her boyfriend of 4 years and marries another guy 4 months later. She was deeply in love, more than she can ever know but her ex stalled and stalled to marry her, and she got desperate and didnt wnat to wait any longer.      So, she gets back with another ex from her past, he immediately proposes and she accepts. When the other guy found out, he begged and begged her to get back with him, he tried to stop the wedding, but she said it was too late.      Now she is married for one year, and this entire year she called her ex once every week or so, she was upset, confused, regretful of her choice, knew she was desperate.   Her husband treats her well, and she says that he loves her so much and admits this. But her heart she can admit (if she had to) is still with the other guy and she cant believe her reality is what it is, but she has decided to "make the best of it." and accept her choice and hope for the best.   If this is how she feels after one year, will this marriage work out and she be happy? Or will this "bad" decision doom this marriage in the longrun?

20090223074347AAqUF5q	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is there a binding marriage/engagement contract in Canada?	A friend of mine is in love with this girl, but he proposed to another woman in the past (before he met my friend). They broke up and both dated other people, and he's been with my friend ever since. Now though, he's telling my friend that they can't be together because there's some papers that he signed with his former fiance that says he has to get married to her, and there's no way out of it unless she agrees not to get married in a few years. What I know of marriage is that if it's not arranged, you can't get forced to the alter. Wouldn't it be the case that if one person in the marriage party said no, that there would be no marriage? He doesn't even love the other woman and has said in the past he'd never go back, but he's head over heels for my friend (or so it seems).  He never even mentioned this to her before- as far as she was concerned she was dating a single man that had a breakup with his cheating ex. [When he did get engaged to this girl, it was for a while and he was young, so I'm thinking he possibly doesn't understand what he signed, so I'm checking it out to see] When marriage came up, it was about my friend. He even looked for a ring. After her, he said, he wouldn't date anymore if they broke up (which they haven't).       So the sudden talk about being bound to marry his ex makes no sense when he was considering marrying my friend or being single for the rest of his life.      Is it true? Is there really a paper in Canada that you sign that says you must get married to someone, even if an engagement was broken off? Any help about how marriages in Canada work would be great. I just want to know if he really could be bound to some girl he broke up with, or if he's just making that up and is looking for an excuse to breakup. What would you sign before getting married, that says you have to wed even if you break up?      Thank you! Let me know if you need me to clarify. Age doesn't matter at this point. Everyone's old enough.

20090222223821AAKEjPK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When he says he doesn't love you?	Help, I met this guy at a party and felt very attracted to him, but when he asked me out I turned him down because I thought he loved himself too much. Later though (a couple of months later) I called him up to chat as I was feeling lonesome and we both agreed we should catch up. Our date went really well and he called me up regularly after that. On the second date he french kissed me and then we always ended up making out, but not having sex because I didn't feel ready. Then one time when I was going away for business I said I loved him, but he said he didn't love me because he didn't know me well enough and he said it takes a long time to love a person. Also we did not decide if we were boyfriend and girlfriend because to be his girlfriend he says I might need to have sex and so I though best I am not his girlfriend. I am now back from my business trip and wondering if I should call him up. I don't believe he doesn't love me and suspect he was mad I was going away and leaving him and doesn't want me to be his girlfriend because he wants to get me to have sex, but this is just a hunch and could be wishful thinking because I am in love with him. Is it worth calling him up to find out or would it be best to wait till he calls me. I might be going away for good anyway in a few months as a transfer for work is looming in the horizon and it seems cold to go away for good without saying anything to him but then I wonder if he cares at all. Please help, I am very confused and it this situation also hurts my feelings a lot.

20090223013553AAOJzyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	EVERYONE: What can I do???	In June of 2008 my guy friend was just leaving my house and I see him once a month because he lives an hour away. Well, he had just gone on vacation with me and my family and had asked me out on vacation and I didn't answer him (thought he might be joking, didn't want to be hurt) and he made many, many advances. Well, we were back at my house and he was just about to leave and he was stalling in the kitchen and I said, aren't you gonna say good-bye to me? And I had just got out of the pool and he had too, but he was dressed in dry clothes, and he walked over and hugged me, and then smiled and said, can I kiss you? I just smiled and leaned in, and we were an inch from kissing, and the sucky part is, my brother was in the room and he started laughing and I hadn't even noticed he was there. So, I pushed my friend away and he was upset and then he left. Nothing has happened that made us close like that again. What can I do to make something happen?????? Thanks.

20090223001343AAqyR72	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you date or be friends with a guy like this?	This guy wants to date me, but my friend already told me what he did to his ex gf, while she was pregnant with his child. He cheated on her, and even brought the girl he cheated with to the hospital while she was having the baby. He seems like a nice guy, he's whining and dining me and he's doing things for me, going out of his way for me...but I dont know if I could trust him.      Would you date him, does his history matter at all?
20090223042553AAUP3Kh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	An old flame walks back into my life after 30 years?	We dated 30 years ago and wanted to get married, but it never happened.

What' have I done that is so wrong?
20090223001922AAniQ7J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there a chance that my boyfriend is secretly trying to get me pregnant?	I just turned 19 and he's 25...it was love at first sight and after a couple months dating he started begging me to have kids with him. I told him that I wanted to go to college, graduate, and work for at least a year first and he agreed to that...but sometimes he will get into this whole, "i want kids" thing...like we were joking that I was pregnant and he got really into...anyways, the other day I asked him to not *** inside me so often because although I'm on the pill, I'm still paranoid him:"you're just paranoid about getting pregnant?"    me: "well yeah...there is still that small chance."    him: "that would be sooo cool if you got pregnant!"   and I was like, "...um nooo. I'd have to get an abortion!'   and he seemed upset about that...   besides always wanting to *** inside me...he keeps taking me out to all-you-can-eat places and feeding me lots of high calorie foods. Today he bought me some packs of cookies and I was like, "cool...100 calorie packs (they were)"   (he obviously didn't know) and he seemed really upset like, "100 calorie packs...? i didn't know :/"   I'm thinking that maybe he is trying to get me to gain weight so that I wouldn't notice if I got pregnant...   Am I just being paranoid or does this sortta make sense?   Thanks :)

20090223070146AA30efU	Family & Relationships;Family	Help! i really need an advice?	Today, i was feeling really sick at school. So, i just got out of school and went home. I didn't bother to tell my dad to pick me up, because his job is really strict and i didn't wanted him to worry. Anyways, one of my teacher notice that i left, so she calls my dad, and tells him. My dad comes calls me all pissed at me, and yelling at me. I told him that " i really, really felt sick". Yet he still screams at me. Seriosly, am a guy in 11 grade, and i usually never cry for anything. But, this time, it hurt me so bad that i almost did. Not so much the fact that he was pissed at me, but for the fact, that he never understand me. He is not like the cool parent that you can just sit and talk to and neither is my mom. Like, i have a lot of anxenty problems, and i also have OCD. Every time i go to the bathroom, i have to take a shower right after it. I also hide everything in the bathroom. Like i take the things out. My parents have seen me doing this, and all they do is yell at me. They tell me am such a stupid idiot for doing that and they make me feel worthless. I've try to stop but common man, its not in me that controlls that. it's my head I really need to go see a psychologist. My parents always think bad, and they over react for everything and get mad for everything. Honestly, the best days for me are when i don't go to school. Not because i get to miss school, but because am away from them. Their is no screams not anything. Not crancking old people. I love them and all but i need to get away from them! As soon as possible!  They make me so depress. Like one time i try to pass out and overdose myself. So i drank 6 sleeping pills. Am just really depress, mad, that i don't have my parents to count on. Can anyone give me an advice.

Why can't I just let it go if i know its not even something i want?!   i don't know if i'm making sense but i don't know how to explain it.    Any way i am currently doing something like this because some guy i don't even like hasn't called or texted me in a while even though i kind of blew him off for plans this weekend. i did it because i'm not interested but now that he hasn't called or texted i  want to keep talking to him.   I know i shouldn't call him and i haven't so far but ooo i want to. god now that i type this i can see what my problem is but can you tell me how i can stop doing this?
20090223055902AAjvOWS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need Advice!  What to do in a marriage like this?	My wife and i have seperated I think.  See, she doesnt want to talk about the Big "D", but she also doesnt want to leave the house because she wont leave her kids.  I've tried everything short of having the police come over and physically remove her from my house.  I'm tired of trying to fix a marriage that she obviously doesnt want and I'm tired of having a wife who sleeps on the couch every night.  She says she doesnt know what she wants right now, but knows she hates me at the moment and wants to live and raise our kids as if nothing is wrong.  I cant handle it and i'm ready to find another woman, i have needs and i'm tired of these games.  She goes out with friends and gets so drunk that she passes out on their couch and i'm tired of playing the good parent and doing the right thing and getting treated like poop in return.  Is it wrong to feel this way?  What should I do about her stupid games?  Am I wrong to think I deserve someone who will treat me better?

20090223041208AAEydK5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am so confused....Ex BF, New BF...Me being a jerk?	Okay let me just get this out there.  I know I am messed up, I have issues (don't we all).  I can't seem to make a long commitment with anyone.  My last BF (ex) adored me we had a really fun relationship but there were also a lot of BS.  We both drank too much.  He drove me nuts with his obnoxious personality.....he is a slob, doesn't take care of himself etc....we break up, I end up dating a new guy.   He doesn't drink, he takes care of himself.  He is liberal like me.   My ex is very conservative.   So I was enjoying the new guy how ever could not get the old one out of my head.   So after 3 months I call him (the ex) I blatantly dump the new guy (I was so wrong to do that).   I am sitting here thinking?  what am I doing???  Maybe I should just be alone!  I don't know!   I am going to counseling with my ex, and I want to go alone too.      Some stats:  I am 44 never married, my ex whom I am now back together with 43 never married.  The new guy 34 never married.      I didn't realize how much the new guy was falling for me until yesterday.  I feel terrible.      I know this question is all over the place.  I apologize for that.      I wish I could give more details but this is already too long.      Advice??

20090223070054AAtc0Dt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Attractive women.......?	Whenever I am in public, I can always spot an attractive woman. Sometimes you can’t help but appreciate rare beauty. Usually, I maintain eye contact with some beautiful women and hope they would look my way. I don’t, as much as, stare or stalk at them. I give a few glances. Then, when they are walking pass me, I usually make sure I smile and maintain eye contact. I noticed that whenever I’m shy and initiate eye contact, I tend not to smile but glance a bit.       I want to know if women also exhibit this kind of behavior whenever they are in public (attracted to hot men). I like to know a female’s perspective on this. Do you ladies, do the same thing? Can you describe?

We broke up a few months ago and we didn't talk at first, but no we are talking about every day. And well when we talk sometimes there would be heavy flirting, and sometimes there would be nothing at all, and he was really sending me mixed signals...      So like i said last night we talked and had a serious conversation, and he told me that he loved me, and that he wants to be with me, just that he doesn't want to **** up again... He said that since he will be turning 18 next month he will finally have the chance to go out an party without anyone telling him he can't.. and he said that he didn't know how he would handle himself in that situation and he didnt want to do something that would hurt me and mess things up with us... And he kept saying that he didnt want to lose me and that he wants to be with me....       After all of this i still just don't know what to do.. I really do love him... And ive realized that after all this time... Any advice.....      No mean comments..

My husband (her stepfather) is blaming me for all that has happened, and he's been saying he don't want the baby's father around which I find ridiculous. I already told the boy we want him to be around if he wants to.

I am just curious if anyone would think he may propose anytime soon. I know you do not know him but the situation is like this. I am working full time, he is a full time college student who also is very involved in another school activitey and works. He is also leaving for the summer and we are going to move in together in August. Is there a chance that he may propose before he leaves for the summer? He knows and we have talked about it that I want to get married right after he graduates. Would he wait until after he graduates? Thank you for honest answers!

20090223062920AAUOXIE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help in Filing for Pro Se Divorce?	Okay, here's the problem.  I filed for absolute divorce in the state of MD almost two months ago.  My estranged husband filed an answer, but didn't follow directions and the court sent it back to him.  He corrected the original problem and mailed a photocopy of the answer to the court. Again the court rejected his answer and mailed it back to him.  At this rate, this uncontested divorce may take months or even a year to complete.  If I file a "Request for Order of Default" would the court accept it; since my husband did respond but responded incorrectly?

20090223002013AAdYJuQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS : What are some signs that you want out of a relationship?	I have been with my BF for a year now. And we just moved in together. He has been acting strange lately either out of his own insecurity or because I think he wants me to break up with him. Let me tell you, I have broken up with him before. 7 times in the 1 year we have been dating and everytime I did he would break down, start crying, we would come to an agreement and stay together. It's confusing me and I just want him to tell me the truth .. does he or doesn't he want to be with me? Because I can find other guys and their are other guys  that would love to be with me. I tell him I love him, he tells me he loves me then why is he acting this way. He says he wants to have kids with me someday, marry me. He told me this towards the middle of our relationship. Is he having 2nd thoughts?? I don't know. What I do know is I want the truth. Because I don't want to waste my time when another guy would not behave like this with me so I can feel happy and less stressed. I love him so much, I have showed him in many ways and done everything I can to make it clear. I told him all of this and he said he still loves me and is attracted to me, that he loves me living with him.      So guys, my BF is confusing the hell out of me and I don't know what's going on but it is becoming painful. What are the black & white signs? I need to know, no more games.

20090223050813AAFVRtK	Family & Relationships;Family	Was this an unreasonable thing of my mother to say?	I was recently in London for a weekend with a few friends. I had a great time and didn't want to go home. I went to a few bars and also clubbing and found the girls there friendly and some of them really attractive. I live in Yorkshire, I have an OK job, but I don't have a GF and I hate it here. All the girls I know here are either taken or horrible. Yesterday I was talking to my mother and I said I wanted to find a job in London and move there because there seemed so many more attractive and friendly single girls down there than up here. She then laughed and said I wouldn't have a chance with any of them, that with my looks I should count myself lucky to get a plain girlfriend or even one at all, that London was a snobby and unfriendly city and that I should get real. I feel really annoyed by this.

I am outgoing person and always share something or secret with my friend, but this week, it is just like I have a social problem. I gotta three friend, first I present you A,(Actually he's not new as I/You think) he seems to be funny and more experienced than me (I prefer to share Ideas than to have a sense of humor). Next I present you B and C, well this person was so lucky, I tried to be close with them and A also want to be close with them (It is because B and C was good in Mathematics and History a.k.a Brilliant). Let's start the story, A,B and C was my good friend, but I prefer more B and C. B and C also my good friend, they prefer me, than A. (Cause for me sometimes A was so annoying, I don't know, maybe he too excited) B and C was actually more closer than me(we close about 2 years non-stop). it's not until when B and C asking A and me (especially A) to go to cybercafé, I refuse (I didn't have money that time) so, before I went home, A said to me 'I wonder why B and C always asking me when they want to go to any place?...When he said like that ARGHH! I felt more (Does A think that he want to be leader in this group?) I DON'T LIKE THAT! There would be no leader in our group it is all about freedom not power :(      So next week, B and C was more attracted to be more with A and I don't know why...The most Sh!T thing is, A just like want to kick me in this group (Example, A said to me just in this morning when I have a conversation with B, A said "Don't you have any other things to do?" I said "yeah" and went back to my chair and saw A have a chat with B, well I called that INTERRUPTION!) I was very frustrated   1. Why B and C have to be close with a person that only told stupid joke and annoying?   2. Why A want to kick me?   3. What should I do to fix this matter?      I don't want to be a leader, I just want to have a social life, I don't mind have a better relationship with A, but he insist to be with me...Please help me?

20090223043552AA0wOZz	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Whether to stay or whether to leave!?	I have a long distance boyfriend who was supposed to move to my city to be closer to me. He came for 2 job interviews and thought they went well but unfortunately he didnt get the job, Because of the financial crisis, it was difficult for him to find any other job (my city is prety badly hit).   He then went back to his city and was offered a promotion in his current job there, I told him to take it because it might be the only job he'll find.    Since his decision to take the new job, he has started talking to me a lot less. He has begun coming online less to chat, less texting, and less phoning. He talks to me maybe 2-3 times a week and when he does he's very affectionate. He disappeared on me for 6 days. I didn't contact him in this time, as I wanted to test him. He finally contacted me over facebook after those six days but acted like nothing happened.   We were having a text conversation a 2 days ago and he suddenly stopped replying. What should I do? Should I talk to him about this? I feel like his actions show he is pretty much done with our relationship.   It seems like this is his way of ending it, but I could be wrong.   Could anyone please give me some advice on how to handle this?   OH, and he keeps making plans to visit me but he is unsure when his boss will give him a break, as it is a new job and everything. Every time I talk to him he says he can't wait to see me soon. Whats his deal?

20090223055201AAdM0zM	Family & Relationships;Family	I swear I am going to lose my mind!?	Okay, this may get kinda in depth...so try to keep up.       My grandparents are driving me crazy!! I love them to death, but I can't stand it anymore! I am married with three children, and we live in the house that was my mother's. She died and I sort of inherated the house. I don't pay anything to live here, I just pay the bills. The house is three houses down from my grandparents..which makes them a daily part of our lives. They are very well off finacialy and they help me out when we are short on cash. The thing about that is, they think that all these things give them a right to an opinion of how my husband and I live our lives and how we raise our kids.       We have three kids, 7, 2 and 1. The lady that lives next door to my grandparents is a tutor, and i agreed to allow my 7 year old to go there once a week for a little extra help...thought it couldn't hurt. Well, since the tutor is a "family friend" I guess she thinks she is entitled to more with my child than just the tutoring sessions. The tutor and my child's teacher are friends, so they talk on the phone quite a bit. Seems like the tutor knows about my child's day at school before I do most of the time!! Which makes me a little bit upset. The other night, the tutor called at about 8 pm and asked to speak to my daughter. I put her on the phone and they talked for a moment and she hung up. I asked what the tutor wanted to talk about, and my daughter said "Oh, she was telling me that she was proud of me getting second place in the spelling bee today." I didn't even know there was going to BE a spelling bee!! Much less that my daughter had done so well in it! I felt kinda shafted that I wasn't able to congradulate her first! This is not the first incedent that has happened like this. There have been notes sent home in sealed evelopes addressed to the tutor that have been in my daughter's folder. I opened one up once and it was talking all kinds of crap about me because I have tattoos on my forearms and black hair with bright red streaks through it. ( They are just little stars on my arms, and my hair is not crazy looking.) I really did not appreciate this, and wrote the teacher back a note saying some rather nasty things to her. I also let the principal know about it. I let that go eventually and continued the tutoring as it seemed to be helping my daughter some. But, now it has come to the final blow. My grnadparents are the ones that are paying for the tutor, and they are FURIOUSE with me for saying that I don't want my daughter to go any more. They keep telling me that my husband and I are doing SUCH a disservice to our daughter. That her education is going to suffer soooo much. When she gets A's and B's.....she is reading perfectly, she's great! Sometimes she comes home from the tutor, which has somehow morphed into 2 and 3 days a weeks, with no homework done! Also, the tutor has started wanting to take my child to church with her, to lunch on Saturdays, sending "art supplies"like extra bits of wrapping paper and tissue paper home. I feel like she is over stepping her bounds, but everyone else thinks my husband and I are crazy! When I told my grandmother that I wasn't going to allow her to go anymore, she flipped out. And since then, the tutor has called me at 11pm one night, 9 pm the next night, ( i didn't answer either time) and last night...the woman CAME TO MY HOUSE WHILE WE WERE EATING DINNER!!! She saw that we were eating and didn't even care. My husband answered the door and let her in, she came in and I said, "Linda, I do not want to discuss tutoring. Avery is not going anymore, that is the end of the discussion. " and she started talking about how much she loves Avery and how we aren't thinking of what is best for her. It went on for about 45 minutes and my husband finally told her, "Linda, we are the parents and we say no more. Now you can leave our house." and she started trying to tell him to be quiet and all. I thought my husband was going to lose it!!!!       It seems like my grandparents, linda the tutor and everyone else are in our business WAY to much. I can't stand it anymore. They know when Avery goes to school and when she dosen't, they know when we put our garbage out and when we don't. My grandparents have a key to this house and come in here when we are gone. Moving is not really an opption, we don't have anywhere else to go, the money to move, and my husband is locked into his job for at least a year. I swear I feel like I am walking around naked sometimes...like we have no privacy what so ever. I have tried and tried to talk to my grandparents about all this, but they just say that I have a smart mouth and i am being disrespectful. I don't know what to do. HELP!!! Sorry again for the wall of text......thanks for reading!

20090222235353AA4GCrW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unappreciative Comment From My Girlfriend, What Should Do?	I rarely let little comments bother me and I never get angry. Last night my girlfriend said to me that I never take her out to dinner. It confused me, in the 6 months we have been dating, ive counted that we have been to 37 nice restaurants, one of them we have been to 4 times and another 3. So we have been out to dinner 42 in 180 days. These have all been nice places where we have both ordered $20+ plates. Im a 20 year old student so thats a lot. It leads me to think she doesnt appreciate it and it makes me feel like the 42 times we have gone to dinner have been pointless.      Should this bother me and what should i say to her or do?       thank you very much for reading
20090223065311AAmDgQs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to find out if she likes me?	ok, I like one of my friends a whole lot. Were friends, but not like best friends. We went to the movies a couple weeks ago. Since then, and that night. shes been sending me a lot of mixed signals, some say she likes me, some say lets be friends. Now, theres this other girl at work that I know likes me, but I like my friend alot more than her, but I dont really know her that well. Would it be ok to ask my friend if she likes me cuz I know another girl does? I would find a better way to say it, but would that be too forward and stupid? Thanks.

I want to say a good 5-10 times.    And then when I was headed out, I got a high-five out of it.         Sooooo, should I go back and talk to him again, or what?!

Now as for me, my friends say that I am a really cute girl, even the cutest out of all my friends, my grades are ok and i love to wear cute outfits and be funny. but he is just so awesome and i have no idea!

I hear story after story, and just when I think he's done, he'll run into one of them! One time he told me about one of his ex-girlfriends who he had kept secret from everyone. The next week we were at the mall and he saw a girl who he said looked like her. Then the week after that, he saw her, like he was looking for her! That's not the only thing either! He's told me that he still loves two of his old girlfriends, but not like he used to he says! Oh and it's not just ex-girlfriends, he'll point out every hot girl he sees! Or he'll come home and tell me about all the hot girls he saw at work. When I tell him I hate it, he says that he picked me!   Am I just being jealous? Should I shut up, because it's not wrong? This is my first real relationship! I just want to know if I'm wrong or he's wrong.    I know it's good he at least tells me about his feelings and that we're open to talking about this stuff, but is it normal to be brought up every week and sometimes at least twice a week? Help!

So I'm with my current boyfriend, we have a daughter together, and things were going okay. But thing have happened between him and I, such as arguing a lot, and between him not understanding where I'm coming from and his blatant disregard for how I feel toward certain subjects, I am starting to feel unwanted by him. He assures me that I am wanted by him, and he loves me a lot no matter what.    But I'm starting to have feelings for my ex boyfriend, and good friend. I'm starting to wonder what my life would be like if he had never left me, and it's eating me up. I can't stop thinking about him. I still love my boyfriend to tears, don't get me wrong. And I have told him about these feelings toward my ex. I don't want things to get worse between us!    I feel like a total ***** though. This isn't fair to him. And I don't want this to come between us. I would prefer him over my ex, any day. I just am scared this is the beginning of the end with us. How do I overcome this?

A German guy asked me out to a dance party, but he said sorry that he gotta postpone it because he'd forgotten about an appointment that he already had.

I must admit that I dint make thing clear by listening to his reason, but I prefer gentlemanliness. So... what do you think?

I thought i had a best friend but she has went behind my back several times and talked smack about me, i have always been there for her and it really hurts when she goes behind my back, and all i do is give into her. What would you do if your best friend kept going behind your back, would you keep forgiving them or just end it with them?

20090223000414AAo2yf6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Figuring out a stripper?	So i might have "played my cards right" so to say, last night, in a strip club. Didn't really pay attention to any girls, except the bartender, yet this stripper spent her whole night(the apparent only night she works) talking with me (flirting, even gave me the nickname of "solid gold" somehow..don't really know how) , full well knowing that i wasn't going to spend any $ on her in the club (as i expressed to her several times) . Asked if i wanted a dance, to buy her drinks, told me she was up next, and i more or less ignored or politely declined her, because i told her that, "the strip club wasn't the right place to spend money on a girl."    The interesting part is that i think this made her more into me. Instead of hustling all the guys that night, she decided to sit and talk with me for hours. Real beautiful girl and It sounds retarded, but i'd like to take her out, think she'd be a lot of fun, but don't really know about the whole deal.    I told her i'd like to take her out, but she said she couldn't give me her #. with a story of "she'd tried that in the past and she ended up with stalkers and creeps". She said if i was serious, she'd like to see me in there again. So what is this girls deal? is this just a ploy to get me "back in the club" so i spend $ or do you think this girl is actually interested. I definitly played a game with her..so is she doing the same??
20090223001714AA10i56	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't women make up their minds about the good guy/bad guy?	What is the deal with woman always wanting a "good guy". Looking for the guy who calls her just to say hi, opens doors, buys her flowers, is faithful, dependable, and honest, and able to commit. Yet when they have it, they get scared or just don't want it. I've heard the classic line a million times. "You too good for me". what the heck is that suppose to mean? Please explain why you woman want a guy that treats you like a door mat, doesn't respect you, talks down to you, ignores you, and uses you?       It seems that women will do anything for a guy that doesn't want them, yet nothing for a man that does. I'm sure it has something to do with how "challenging" the guy is, but at some point you have to put games aside in your life and just be you. When does this happen? or does it at all? I'm 24 and it seems that every girl my age is out for a bad guy, the challenging type, the dick, yet when they get used and abused, they want the good guy, only to get it and then repeat the viscous cycle.       help me to understand this a bit more.
20090223001401AAIStcY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he is liking me?? How do you know if a man likes you?	So I have been hanging out with this guy for a while, and I feel more happy when I am around him. And he seems enjoy being in my company too. My senses kinda feel that he is kinda liking me so he is getting more sweet and nice to me.  but the thing is he doesn't call me or text me just to say Hi. :( If I called him or text him, he pick up his phone and text me back. He never ignored me.He calls me only when he wants to hang out with me. and we don't hang out that much either. It's so awkward! I kinda see his attitude has changed toward to me in a good way when Im around him, but he is not giving me attention when Im not around.    Do you think we are on a right path? How can you tell if the guy like you?Does he like me? :(
20090223001825AAQIzgL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't my girlfriend be physical with me anymore?	Me and my girlfriend met in our freshmen years of college, we hit it off right away and began dating just under two years ago.  In the beginning we couldn't keep our hands off of each other, we could barely make it through a day without jumping on each other.  This went on for about six months, we had the most mind blowing physical relationship i could ever imagine.  We made love at least twice a day and we still could not get enough.  Around six months in we started to slow down we were in love by this time and everything was great, she began staying with me in my dorm room every night.  We still had sex but not as much because of my roommate but every chance we would get we would make love (even if it was in a bathroom or an elevator).  This went on for another six months and then we moved out of the dorms into different apartments, i started to notice a change when she stopped kissing me as passionate as she used to, she stopped initiating as much and things were just different.  about six months of this went on and then we broke up.  We saw other people for 4 months but nobody made me feel like she did.  She called during our breakup regularly and told me she loved me and said that she missed me constantly.  About 1 month ago i finally went out for coffee with her and it was just like old times, there was that flirty bond between us.  We ended up going out a few more times just as friends but it turned into more, we kissed and that was it the passion was there again.  She asked if we could be exclusive again and i agreed, we have been back together for a month now.  Now things are even worse, she barely lets me kiss her anymore, we are physical maybe once a week if I'm lucky and I'm getting frustrated.  I need to know if I can get that spark back or if I just have to live without that for the rest of my life.  We are talking about moving in with each other at the end of the year and I feel like she is the one I want to be with for the rest of my life, so I just want to know if the days of feeling that spark are over or if there is something I'm doing wrong.  We have talked about this and she gives me different answers every time.  I dont know what to do I try so many different things, we gone on overnight trips, we have gone out to fancy restaurants, I constantly attempt new things to make her excited about being intimate.  Should I really have to try this hard or is this relationship a lost cause.

20090223003553AA8myrq	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does this mean...?	I asked my guy friend if I was tomboyish because of some survey on facebook, and he said yes. I asked why. He said he didn't want to give out examples because they weren't as thoroughly thought out. (I asked him before if I was gullible and he said yes and listed some occurances.) I then said that I wasn't too positive about the definiton of a tomboy, so I wikipedia'd it. He did too. He asked if I had a lot of guy friends. Some IMs later, I said no. He said I seem like I would have many. Then he said, "No offense or anything."      Anything to be picked from this?

On her myspace, she uses all caps but on her letter "i" she leaves thats undercase.      2 days ago, I noticed she had a new top #2 friend. (I am #1 on hers).      On this #2 account, it also uses all caps and lower case "i". My girl friend is #2 on this account. But their is a guy on as #1 on this account.      My girl friend told me that this is her cousin's account. When I asked her if she created it for her cousin she said no but that doesnt explain the whole caps and lowercase "i"s.      Am I just over reacting? Maybe the cousin picked up this writing style from my GF?

I haven't done anything beyond kissing and I don't plan too until I know how I feel about it. I prefer to wait until marriage, but my family is telling me I'm setting myself up for disappointment so I am starting to rethink it. What are your stories/suggestions? I've been going over this in my mind for the last few weeks and I thought I'd make an account and ask on here since I know what my friends would say. I'm not going to just go out and lose it I would at least be in a serious relationship if I decided not to. I really want to wait, but I don't want to become bitter because I feel like I waited for nothing, I just want to be happy.       Even if you didn't answer thanks for listening, it feels better writing it all out.

Hi everyone, I am a 21 year old Indian girl, I passed out B.com this year with an agregate of 72%.... i had a few job offers in MNC's, but i rejected them for pursuing MBA... But my efforts were overcome by my badluck and i could not take up MBA this year!      Recession has hit job market and my confidence is shattered...i have no job right now.   i am preparing for the 2009 mgmt entrance tests now.   (my ambition is to pursue MBA , be a good manager and settle in life.)      in the meanwhile... my parents want me to get married.. though i am not interested ( i have told them, but they don't listen to me, they start scolding me, that i back answer.. my mom even curses me!)... and they have been searching for the groom for over 6 months now! a few guys came to see me, my dad did'nt like a few a few rejected me.      my dad and mom never supported my ambitions..All they want is that i should get married and go...the reason they give is that my mom's health is'nt good( i agree, but she has never tried to improve her health anytime, she never follows docs advice, infact she does the opposite)       she sometimes insults me by comparing me to others( even children)..   she compares me to beautiful girls and insults me in front of them... my dad sings corus by commenting on MBA.      i don't mind even if they don't encourage me... but these sarcasms and insults r shattering my confidence and zest for life.      I understand that all parents want is ur wellbeing, but there is a time for everything right? and there appraoch has hurt me badly.      i don't want to die.... everytime i get upset over these.. i say to myself that "every dog has its day" but i really have lost hope that my day will arrive.      I have no one to tell all this to, and thus had only Ya as option.   (i had wonderful friends with whom i could share all these... but now they r too busy and call and meet rarely.. i dont want to spoil their mood.)      plz tell me... what should i do?

Why is it that if you are angry or have caught them doing something that hurts you, instead of dealing with it they would rather avoid it all together, or run and hide?

I like her, just I'm really not sure if shes right. I mean she drinks very often and when she does it's quite heavy, shes quite a playful with people and a tease. She is quite happy to tell things to people behind my back, not necessarily bad things, but things i didn't want let out. She also has an obsessive friend who I think even she knows if bad for her but keeps her close cause she doesn't want to be alone.      But in saying that, shes a great person. I think she one of those truly good people, she makes me laugh, and I enjoy being around her.      When I do think about it, we don't have really that much in common, but I can't stop these feelings.      Some give me a good hard slap of advice, or helping hand, would be much appreciated, thank you.

20090223053337AAVxt3o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I approach my husband about our sex life?	My husband and I got married 5 months ago and we have an 11 month old baby.  The minute my husband found out I was pregnant he stopped wanting to have sex, despite trying to tell him it wasn't dangerous, asking the doctor with him etc he thought it would hurt the baby - my sex drive was enormous and insatiable during my pregnancy so him not wanting sex drove me crazy - we had sex once during the pregnancy and now since having our baby we have had sex less than 10 times, I can't even remember when we had sex last at the moment.    We have had a very full on few years, his mother passed when I was 10 weeks pregnant which I know and understand had a huge effect on our relationship especially the physical sid.  We also run  our own business which sees him doing long hours and being tired a lot.   I have tried speaking to him, i have explained that his not wanting to have sex with me feels like rejection.   When we first started dating we had an amazing open sex life, I used to initiate sex all the time, now I don't dare ask as I'm so sick of being rejected and if I do complain a bit about it he tells me that that is making the situation worse.  His lack of intimacy with me has in turn made me not want to touch him, even to be nice and affectionate toward him.  This is turning into a vicious cycle but I don't know how to break it - I just feel so hurt and rejected by him...what do I do??
20090223053420AAgrXkO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesnt she want to meet in person?	One for the lady’s?      I’ve been talking to this very nice woman for a while now. But only texting and by phone.   We have had some great conversations and seem to have a lot of similar interest.   She is very funny and makes me laugh a lot.   She has shared a lot of very personal things with me and really seems to like me.   The problem is, we have never met. Every time I ask to take her out or even just meet for coffee, she will either act like I didn’t say anything,  or there will be some reason why she cant get together.   I wouldn’t be reading so much into this except, we really hit it off.     We’ve been talking for over three months now. don’t most people want to meet and see if there is any spark before they waist a lot of time on someone that isn’t right for them?    It is really starting to feel like there might be another guy in the picture, she’s not married, but maybe a boyfriend.   that’s cool, if she is dating other people, but not cool if she is lying by omission about a serious relationship.   If she is on the tail end of some defunct relationship, I would be very apprehensive of getting involved.    I think people should take some time to become them selves again after a failed relationship.   And I really don’t want to come between two people that might work out their problems.   This is a new one for me and would really like some input on her  (I want you, I want you, stay away) thing.   I’m not pushy and  I’m no stalker so any advice would be appreciated. thanks
20090223053452AAgO2Tv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	PLEASE HELP...Pregnant and Going Through Major relationship Problems.......?	My Boyfriend and i have been living together for almost a year. We were happy and seemed to have a good relationship. We both have a kid each from previous relationships, and i am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child. We have discussed our future many times and seemed to be moving forward without issue other then his ex giving him problems seeing his son. Then his son came to live with us for about 7 months and everything was fine. Now almost a year later the ex took him back and i found out recently that they had been having an affair... We are trying to work things out, and he truly seems to b sorry and say's he doesnt want t be with her but she wont let him see his son unless he does what ever she wants.  I know that he is also responsible for these problems but she is now extorting him for money, and sex and not allowing him to see his kid. He says he wants to be with me and doesnt want to break up, but he feels like maybe if he's alone things will get better and she;ll let him see his  son..... I Dont know What to do or what to think...He realizes that he made a mistake but what do we do now...
20090223053917AAseYzR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't forgive myself!?	Last summer I met up with an old boyfriend because we were both out of work.      It was only for a few friendly chats, anyway it got out of hand.      I ended up sleeping with him a couple of time's.      I live with a gorgeous man who I adore and I told him 5 month's afterwards.      I told him that I deeply regretted it and I also told my ex boyfriend that I didn't want our friendship to go that way.      I am still with my boyfriend and we are very happy but I just can not forgive myself.      I feel like I am weak for having sex with an old boyfriend and I feel like I have ruined my relationship with my boyfriend.      Do you think I should just stop torturturing myself and move on?

When I'm driving my gf will grab my stuff out of nowhere and start unzipping my pants and touching me it distracts me and almost caused an accident once.  We were at a store in line paying this weekend and she just grabbed me out of nowhere it is embarassing and she thinks its funny.  If we goto a movie she will just grab me and start rubbing me on me and trying to undo my pants or if we're at dinner she will put her foot on my crotch and push into it.  I don't know what to do to get her to take me serious she just says stop being a baby and any man would enjoy it but I don't think so.
20090223061008AAdrBwr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell my new girlfriend.....?	I am your average guy, late 20's I have always been attracted to hot girls...the exotic dancer type. As for a girlfriend... I would either find one, who was hot and bitchy... or find one who wasnt hot, and she would be perfect...as I enjoy being attracted to a girls mind too. That's what I have now...a girl who is not as hot as she could be. But awesomely smart. My thinking is, if I have a hot chick who also stimulates me mentally. I wont look anywhere else....cause I'll have my little hottie. So here is my question:      How can I tell my new girlfriend that she needs to drop 15 lbs and start wearing makeup?
20090223061433AAC449v	Family & Relationships;Family	Question on religion and famiy having problems with sons girlfriend?	My wife and I are 2 different religions, I am Jewish and she is Catholic. We been together for 31 years, from High School. It works for us. I am not religious at all in fact I feel religion separates but I don't force my ideas on anybody.We have a tree at christmas i have been in more Churches then Temples in my life. Last January my son started dating a girl who lives in Upstate Ny. From what I gather her mother is nuts literally, she controls every moves this girl does. She will be 18 this coming November.we live in the Mid-hudson valley area of Ny which is 274 miles door to door from her home. This times she has been down to my home I have driven her both ways because she is afraid to take train. She Came to my Home on Christmas which fell near Hanukkah . My parents have a family get together nothing religious at all. well her mother found out and her true colors came to light. Her mother the devote Catholic wanted to know why did we bring her daughter to a Jewish ritual and we are trying to covert her. Now she cant come back to my home, I hear she is uncomfortable around me my son can only go to her home on her mothers terms. My son says her mother filled this girls head with things about Jews. We her mother might let her come to our home on her Easter recess , I have nothing to say to this girls anymore. My wife feels is not the girls fault because she is from a small Upstate town and she does not know any better. I feel its the 21st century, if she moves out of her town and comes to live in our are she is going to come in contact with Jews African Americans,Latinos and other and how can she be so stupid. I am quite upset about this my wife says I am wrong to be upset its not the girls fault .Who is right here and if the chance this girl come back to my home should I ignore her extiance input would be helpful

I am a magazine journalism student who is currently planning an article discussing whether the idea of the wedding has gone?      The feature would debate whether marriage has become more about the wedding day than a long-term marriage commitment. I am therefore looking for people who would be able to contribute to this feature through a personal experience.      Perhaps you or a friend had an extravagant wedding but realised later on that a long-term commitment of marriage wasnt for you. Or maybe on the other hand you and your partner have been living together unmarried for years and see marriage as just a piece of paper.       Please get in touch if you fancy contributing, it'd be greatly appeciated!

There's this popular guy in the year above who always stares and makes eye contact with me. The first time he saw me he just stared, dumbfoundedly, for like 5 seconds (we were walking) and even turned his head to carry on looking.   Anyway, he's recently become friends with one of my good friends.. in quite a short amount of time.. and I was walking with her and she saw him through a class window, and he smiled at her, then immediately went to look at me, and carried on smiling and staring at me, even though he doesn't know me, and he knows her.   Soo, here's the awkward bit...they were sitting together at break, and near the end of break I walk out to the yard and my friend calls me over. It was really awkward because he seemed awkward when i came over. She didn't introduce us so I couldn't talk to him, and I just started talking to my friend, and he looked down. The conversation quickly tapered though because it was kind of embarassing! Then I pretended I had to be somewhere and left haha.      Would this have been embarassing for you? Why did he feel awkward and look down??? What do I do next time my friend is with him and I go to talk to her :S I don't want it to be awkward again!!!! Please help,,, thankyouuu. x x   Best answer given as always.. x
20090223072243AAzgOCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Why is she looking at me?	I really don’t know what to assume on this: I was at a store. From a distance, about 50-100 feet, I spotted 3 women walking my way. At first, there was eye contact but nothing serious. Then as we were about to walk pass each other (5-10 ft)….I saw two of them initiating eye contact. I looked at them and smiled a bit but then they went on about their business.       Any clues to what these women were thinking? Should I assume anything positive or negative. Also, not to sound conceited but I have received compliments from other women (but NOT these women). Thoughts?      I'm posting again coz I think women have a way of making fun of this by saying, "You have something on your face... you're ugly... or you're just downright scary." So ladies, take me seriously, please.
20090223073910AABubKh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did she get so pissed off at me?	My long term exgirlfriend and I split up one year ago, when she dumped me (I was overseas on work for a few months) via the phone and married some other guy, some ex of hers 5 months later. It hurt so bad, and still does. I still dont know what happened, she later told me she thougth i had no intentions of marrying her (we were together 3 years) and she got desperate. I tried to get her back when she split with me, but she never changed her mind.      I was cleaning out my closet and found so many things of hers that she left with me, stuff like cosmetics, books,etc Instead of just throwing them in the trash, I was still so upset and sad, I decided to mail them to her parents house (I dont know her address). I didnt mail flowers, just her old possessions.      The next day, she called my 2 best friends on the phone (she didnt call me) and they told me she was so pissed off at me, that I should have just trashed them, etc. Then her sister called me as well, yelling me, etc. I was the one who was DUMPED in a terrible way when she married someone else, I NEVER called her since she was married (but she called me several times) and never mailed her anything before. I was too upset to even talk to her (but she called me and emailed various times since she got married) Why was she so angry? She is married to some other, why even care what I did? One year after her marriage, why? I still feel terrible over this, it is too hard to describe. I do love her, and wish I didnt but I do.
20090223071950AADhCXj	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i take my exgirlfriend to the prom as a friend?	i'm a pretty honorable guy and while i was going out with this girl i asked her to prom. we broke up but since i already asked her i figured it would be rude not to take her as a friend. well i recently found out that she did some pretty stupid and downright wrong stuff with people and lied to me about it(read below). Im just wondering does her actions make it acceptable for me to ask someone Else...or should i be the bigger person and take her anyway?         i was going out with this girl and i thought we were doing well. then we broke up under weird circumstances and as soon as we broke up she went and gave another guy a ********.. then we got back together like a week after we broke up because she said she was stupid and i was great, she lied and told me that she only kissed the other guy.(i found out from one of her close friends what really happened) anyway. we were together for another two weeks and i still offered to take her to the prom. well, she broke up with me again and went to yet another guy(whom she supposedly hates) and sucked him off too. not even a week after she broke up with me the second time. she doesn't know i know the truth and again my question is should i be the bigger person and take her to prom regardless of what shes done

My gf and I have been going out for more than two years, we recently got back after a two week split and everything is going good now...   I am about to finish my master degree and she will finish her bachelors...we met in college and we both love each other and could possibly get married..   The thing is I am contemplating going back to my country to start a business and would like to maybe bring her   we have joked about her coming to live with me in my country and she said she would, she loves it(I brought her there last year and she didn't want to leave). Although here in America things aren't that bad,I have a job,  two houses(paid for), car etc....and everything I would need...but in order to expand my business ventures I would need to go to my home country(its in the Caribbean)..but maybe also live both here and there is also a possibility..We both love to travel so this is a plus..   She is still considering what she wants to do with her life, while i might have to start running my fathers business in my home country and try to start my own business..   I know she said she would come but am I asking too much of her..?   I think we would have a better future if she does come to my country and live, the fact is that she will be living in both countries and helping me with my ventures..      Need honest opinions???      Facts:   I'm 23 she 22   we both have business degrees..   been together 2 yrs +
20090223071914AAoDf3V	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I selfish or do I have to wait?	Me and my husband has been married for 4 years now.  I'm in my 30's and he's turning 40. It's been a year now that we're talking of having a baby however, we always end up putting it aside because of the fact that he lost his job 10 months ago. Financially we could still afford to have a kid since I'm working full time and we have money in the bank that we saved but my husband does not want us to touch that money. Now he wanted to go to school and told me that maybe we have to sacrifice some of the money for one year so he could finished what he wants to take. I'm not against his plan because finishing an associate or something is an achievement for him. I was thinking this might change his views in life and will boost his self esteem since he dropped out in high school but it would mean that we have to wait for another year to have a baby and who knows even more to wait till he will finished schooling and find a job. I explained to him my desire to have a baby with him now but he seemed not really willing to do it. Maybe because he already have a son from his first marriage?

20090223071010AA6OGDh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I have sex with this guy?	I've been seeing him a for a little over a month and things were going great.  Then last night he told me that he's still getting over his ex, so he doesn't want to get serious right now.  She moved back home, on the other side of the world a couple months ago.  But he said he really does like me, and even called me later that same night.      I'm not really concerned with getting serious right now, but I really do like him so I'd like try and keep that option open.  I'm not going to see him/talk as much so he can have time to get over the ex.      But he's reallly good in bed, so I kinda want to still sleep with him occasionally.      Is this a bad move for eventually moving from rebound to relationship?  Do all rebounds fail anyway, so I should just sleep with him whenever the opportunity presents itself?

20090223070826AA9VRCY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can you help me with a simple centre piece for my wedding?	Ok so I am trying to do as much as I can for my wedding to save money. I have bought fake flower bouquets for my bridesmaids that are ivory, my bridesmaid dresses are lilac so my bouquet will probably have ivory and lilac in it (my sister is buying this for me).      for my centre pieces, i would like something really simple like one or two flowers in a vase with some decorative items around them. I know hardly anything about flowers so not sure what would suit. Can you help? some pictures would be great if anyone has any.       i live in UK if anyone recommends any shops to me.      Thanks!      :)
20090223071028AAK1Cx2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's a Good Dating Site to find Women who are 420 Friendly?	I, at the time being, enjoy smoking a little 420.   I'm sure I'll "grow up" at some point.   But, I'd like to find a woman who enjoys smoking too.   Are there reliable/legitimate sites to find compatible partners?      Does anyone else think a girl who smokes is very attractive?
20090223071104AAYteqX	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriend wont commit to me and my son!!?	We have been going out for fifteen months now. I am ready for taking the next step of moving in together. I have been staying at his at weekends which involves taking all my things over there and my sons. I have to take my washing and ironing so that I get it done for the week after I have to go back to my house every day to reload, see to my pets, housework which involves a 14 mile trip there and back. I work full time and I am physically exhausted. My son is at high school and is going through a typical boy to teenager transition stage. He gets jealous of my relationship because during the week there is mainly me and him but at the weekend that changes. I often think that if we lived together then this would be different as he would see my partner as more of a family member      So I tried to talk to my partner last night about this. He said that he is not ready and it maybe another year until he is and that he won’t be pressured either. If I was the right women I would wait. I thought if you are the right man and I am all you want then you would commit yourself. He said that if we split up in two years time – more negative - I am likely to take half his house under the pressure of a solicitor. He said we have to go on holiday first.  I told him that I need new furniture I was not going to buy but will now because we appear to be going nowhere and why should I live with rubbish when he lives almost like a king!! I told him that you are 35 and you act like a little boy, I am 27 and am well ready for commitment. He wants his cake and eating it – but how long does he expect a woman with a child to go on like this for – carting her child up and down when he needs stability especially at his age. Everything has to be so slow for him and planning everything drives me nuts.      I also want more children but feel I maybe giving my child bearing years up for someone unable to commit himself.       Please advise me!!!!

20090223072316AAkSqXW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My fiancee and I was engaged to be married in June. I have caught him up in a lot of lies.?	He told me the truth of what he has done and said he was sorry. I'm very heartbroken over the matter that he has done this so naturally we postponed the wedding. He has agreed to seek a councilor. Part of me is afraid to trust his again but I see what he is doing for me to prove that he love me. What would you do if you was me? I told him we would take one step and one day at a time...
